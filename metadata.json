In episode 2 of The Seen and the Unseen, Amit Varma is joined by Suyash Rai, an economic analyst from Delhi, as they examine whether demonetisation achieved any of its intended effects, and try to come to terms with some of its unintended (but foreseeable) consequences."

Also, taxes create friction in trade, and the costs are borne by consumers and businesses alike. It\u2019s a negative-sum game."
