00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.880
[Amit Varma]: We have tended to treat it less as a book and more as a periodical.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.920
[Amit Varma]: And we respect the institution we regard as the guardian of that constitution, the Supreme

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.920
[Amit Varma]: Court.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.600
[Amit Varma]: There might be many things wrong with our society and our culture, but we think of the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.680
[Amit Varma]: Supreme Court as the one institution that can mitigate them.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.200
[Amit Varma]: But what if, instead of mitigating the faults of society, the Supreme Court instead reflects

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.160
[Amit Varma]: them and even deepens them?

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:11.640
[Unknown]: What are we to do then?

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.120
[Amit Varma]: My topic for today is the Supreme Court of India and the specific trigger that sparked

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.240
[Amit Varma]: this episode was the disgraceful conduct of the court when it came to recent allegations

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.360
[Amit Varma]: of sexual harassment against the Chief Justice of India.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.120
[Amit Varma]: My friend and frequent guest on the show, the economist Shruti Rajagopalan, who specializes

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.240
[Amit Varma]: in constitutional economics, wrote an angry article about it in The Wire, which is linked

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.240
[Amit Varma]: from the show notes.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.960
[Amit Varma]: I invited her back on the show to chat about this case in particular and the Supreme Court

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.000
[Amit Varma]: in general.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.220
[Amit Varma]: But before we get to that conversation, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.320
[Amit Varma]: This episode of the scene in the unseen is brought to you by Storytel.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.200
[Amit Varma]: going to recommend one book a week that I love.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.120
[Amit Varma]: The book I want to recommend today is Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.600
[Amit Varma]: This is enough of the real world, just take a break from it, it's a classic, it's delightful

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.360

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.840
[Amit Varma]: And remember, you get a 30-day free trial only at Storytel.com slash IBM.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.880
[Amit Varma]: Shruti, welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.880
[Guest]: Hi, Amit.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.720
[Amit Varma]: It's great to be here.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.560
[Amit Varma]: So you know, when I read your wonderful piece in The Wire, the first thing that struck me

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.080
[Amit Varma]: was how angry you were.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.440
[Amit Varma]: You described it as the death of justice in India.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.360
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit more about the case.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.560
[Guest]: So there were a few things going on in this particular case that really distressed me.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.480
[Guest]: So as we all know, there was a sexual harassment complaint by one of the staff members of the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.080
[Guest]: Supreme Court of India who worked for the current Chief Justice, Justice Ranjan Gogoi.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.520
[Guest]: And she sent an affidavit to the other 22 justices of the Supreme Court and requested

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.640
[Guest]: an inquiry into her complaint that she had been subject to sexual harassment and abuse.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.560
[Guest]: Now it just so happens that the Supreme Court of India was the front runner when it came

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.480
[Guest]: to sexual harassment.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.680
[Guest]: This is in a judgment called Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan, which was far back, like in

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:42.020
[Guest]: 1997 and well before there was any MeToo movement or even any serious recognition of the problem

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.280
[Guest]: of sexual harassment at the workplace by any other institution in the country, the Supreme

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.000
[Guest]: Court said, we need to recognize this problem.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.780
[Guest]: There is a huge gap in the law.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.480
[Guest]: In a very activist opinion, they actually did what we call now legislating from the

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.480
[Guest]: bench.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.320
[Guest]: That is in the absence of law, they literally made law.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.440
[Guest]: So the Supreme Court provided a series of guidelines on what needs to be done by every

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.840
[Guest]: single workplace in India to prevent sexual harassment and how to deal with the complaints.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.680
[Guest]: And these guidelines were things like, there needs to be a committee, the committee should

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.720
[Guest]: have at least 50% women, it needs to meet certain criteria, there must be an external

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.360
[Guest]: member to the committee and so on and so forth.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.800
[Guest]: And it is this internal committee where any sexual harassment complaint would be reported

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.720
[Guest]: and they would deal with it swiftly.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.680
[Guest]: And they said that in the absence of any legislation, these guidelines would be law.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.080
[Guest]: And then eventually, many years later, the parliament did pass legislation on sexual

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.480
[Guest]: harassment.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.480
[Guest]: So one would think that given that the Supreme Court was the front runner on this, and they

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.200
[Guest]: are the ones who had actually come up with the guidelines.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.640
[Guest]: And given the fact that these are all members trained in law, they serve in the highest

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:04.560
[Guest]: court of the country, that they would know what to do swiftly and justly.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.520
[Guest]: And what happened immediately after was a series of horrific events.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.200
[Guest]: So the first thing that happened was that the Secretary General of the Supreme Court,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.600
[Guest]: before anything, like overnight, before any committee had been formed or anything else,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.520
[Guest]: just said that these are mischievous and false accusations.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.520
[Guest]: They're trying to malign the institution.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.540
[Guest]: And it's like the opposition and other interfering forces are trying to reduce the stature of

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.120
[Guest]: the judiciary.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.160
[Guest]: So first of all, it seems like there are other members of the staff who had already come

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.360
[Guest]: out in judgment immediately after the affidavit and the complaint had been sent, even before

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.480
[Guest]: anything else had been done.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.280
[Guest]: And this is obviously extremely inappropriate for any institution, but for the Supreme Court,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.720
[Guest]: it's really shocking.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.920
[Guest]: Immediately after that, what happened is the Chief Justice of India constituted a bench

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:09.080
[Guest]: and in this particular bench to hear this matter, he sat on the bench himself along

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.520
[Guest]: with two other justices, Justice Khanna and Justice Arun Mishra, not Deepak Mishra.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.440
[Guest]: So you can imagine that the most fundamental principle of natural justice, which is that

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:27.600
[Guest]: one shall not sit in judgment of one's own cause was completely violated and by the highest

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.120
[Guest]: judicial officer of the country.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.440
[Guest]: And in this particular bench, what they were determining was, it was in reference and they

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.320
[Guest]: said they called it a matter of the highest public interest or public concern.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.160
[Guest]: And they basically sat in judgment on whether the complaint is valid or not, right?

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.440
[Guest]: And you can imagine that the person heading the bench is the person against whom the complaint

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.560
[Guest]: is made.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.520
[Guest]: So even someone completely untrained in law, a two year old would understand that this

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.080
[Guest]: is not fair or just.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.120
[Guest]: Now when it was pointed out that this is a problem, by they I mean the Supreme Court

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:15.580
[Guest]: decided to have an internal committee or an ICC as they call it in the Sexual Harassment

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.440
[Guest]: at the Workplace Act.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:25.360
[Guest]: So the ICC had three justices, Justice Ramana, Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Bhopte.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:32.240
[Guest]: Now the problem was Justice Ramana before he sat on this particular internal committee

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.000
[Guest]: had already revealed to the press that he thought this was a false complaint.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
[Guest]: So once again, someone who had already sat in judgment of the matter and really didn't

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.240
[Guest]: have an open mind was placed on this committee.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.080
[Guest]: So when the complainant brought this to his attention, he had to recuse himself.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.700
[Guest]: The complainant also brought another fact to their attention saying that it had only

00:07:53.700 --> 00:08:00.240
[Guest]: one woman on the panel, whereas the POSH guidelines require that there should be at least 50%

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.760
[Guest]: of the committee has to be women.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:08.760
[Guest]: So then they replaced Justice Ramana with Justice Indu Malhotra.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:15.080
[Guest]: And this particular panel sat and met, there were other violations of their own POSH guidelines,

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.320
[Guest]: which is that there was no external member.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.840
[Guest]: She was not allowed to bring a lawyer to the proceedings.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.040
[Guest]: The proceedings weren't recorded.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.880
[Guest]: No external member was allowed to participate in it.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:33.520
[Guest]: And all this was basically some kind of like an internal mechanism to deal with a problem

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.740
[Guest]: against their own superior.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.440
[Guest]: So it was very clear that the other justices were also floundering because basically they're

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.200
[Guest]: hearing something against their boss.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.160
[Guest]: So in this kind of a panel, it's even more important that an external member be present

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.640
[Guest]: and that external member be someone of a very, very high stature, which is quite easy for

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.640
[Guest]: the Supreme Court.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:59.440
[Guest]: You know, they can bring in a retired justice, they can bring in a retired female justice,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.180
[Guest]: you know, like Justice Rumapal or someone else who has such a stellar reputation.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.840
[Guest]: So this could have very easily been avoided, but clearly they didn't want to avoid it.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:15.160
[Guest]: And finally, what happened is the complainant withdrew her complaint, not because she admitted

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.560
[Guest]: that, you know, this was not a genuine complaint.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:24.480
[Guest]: She said she has absolutely no hope of getting a fair hearing or justice with this panel

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.000
[Guest]: at this institution.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.760
[Guest]: And she is unfortunately right.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.920
[Guest]: And it just really distressed me like this entire series of events.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.020
[Guest]: It felt like the Supreme Court was doubling down on each mistake one after the other.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.120
[Amit Varma]: And it just really distressed me.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.640
[Amit Varma]: And isn't it the case that all of these guidelines, which this so-called posh committee did not

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.080
[Amit Varma]: follow were guidelines originally set by the Supreme Court itself, right?

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.080
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:57.180
[Guest]: So they seem to behave in a fashion that the rules they make must apply to everyone else

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.280
[Guest]: and they must not apply to themselves.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.320
[Amit Varma]: So wouldn't you say that in a sense that the court could itself be set to be in contempt

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.320
[Amit Varma]: of court?

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:14.320
[Guest]: Yes and no, because the contempt laws are not following a very specific judgment, right?

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.600
[Guest]: But the court also has the ability to interpret rules in its own way.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.360
[Guest]: So this is a play of words and you could go either way with this.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.040
[Guest]: But yes, if you strictly think of it as the same rules that apply to everyone else must

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:33.100
[Guest]: also apply to the members of the judiciary, then they are really violating all of those

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.100
[Guest]: principles.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.800
[Guest]: In a very brazen way, like all this is not hidden.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:44.040
[Guest]: This is all happening in, it's playing out in the media, only partially playing out in

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.040
[Guest]: the media.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.280
[Guest]: Frankly, the media was muzzled quite a bit.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.000
[Guest]: A lot of newspapers are scared to run stories about the Supreme Court because they're worried

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.600
[Guest]: they'll be held in contempt.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.800
[Guest]: A lot of people are scared to speak up.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.600
[Guest]: The people most qualified to speak up are from the legal community who unfortunately

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.660
[Guest]: have a lot of cases pending before the judiciary.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.960
[Guest]: So even though the Bar Council and the Supreme Court advocates on record and all these people

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:15.500
[Guest]: came forward and they issued statements condemning the procedural mess, it's very difficult for

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:21.080
[Guest]: scrutiny to come from people who really depend on the Chief Justice of India to get the matters

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.080
[Guest]: through.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.800
[Guest]: So there's a really big problem, you know, systemic problem that is taking place.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.220
[Amit Varma]: And what's also kind of bizarre is, as you wrote in your piece, is that the case became

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:36.960
[Amit Varma]: politicized very fast with cabinet ministers jumping in to defend the Chief Justice where

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.400
[Amit Varma]: it had really nothing to do with them.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, why should they get involved?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.480
[Guest]: So this is the thing that is very worrying, right?

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:53.360
[Guest]: So it seems like any time, so, okay, to me in a civilized society, no one should know

00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:00.400
[Guest]: names of specific justices, you know, to me, that would be the most civilized society of

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.400
[Guest]: all.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.920
[Guest]: You know, maybe, you know, if there was a new Chief Justice sworn in or something, you

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:11.120
[Guest]: know his name, but justice should be based on principles so much so that it doesn't have

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.520
[Guest]: any individuals deep imprint on it.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.920
[Guest]: And we don't think of individuals as partisan and taking sides.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.640
[Guest]: When the government and cabinet ministers, the Attorney General, the Solicitor General,

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.060
[Guest]: they all came out of the woodwork within hours, they completely rubbish the complaint and

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:33.800
[Guest]: malign the reputation of the complainant without knowing all the facts because the complaint

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.920
[Guest]: had been made like 48 hours before all this happened.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.240
[Guest]: And they immediately took the side of the Chief Justice, which shows that something

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.440
[Guest]: is going on, right?

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.960
[Guest]: They want, they think he's their guy or they want him to be at the helm and they don't

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.520
[Guest]: want him to resign or be impeached and so on.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.460
[Guest]: So that makes one extremely suspicious of what is going on.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:04.360
[Guest]: And if you remember Chief Justice Gogoi, who was just a, you know, a senior justice prior

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.320
[Guest]: to this, when Deepak Mishra was the Chief Justice, there was a press conference that

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.020
[Guest]: before senior most judges held.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:18.680
[Guest]: And the only person who flipped his stance later was Justice Gogoi.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.840
[Guest]: And he was the next in line to be appointed Chief Justice of India.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:29.680
[Guest]: And it all seems very messy and complicated in terms of it's very opaque on how justices

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.720
[Guest]: and Chief Justices are appointed and promoted.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:42.560
[Guest]: So it's very unclear where the alliances lie, and precisely why the current government and

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.680
[Guest]: the current executive want to support this particular Chief Justice.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:53.280
[Amit Varma]: Right, so let's step back for a moment and, you know, take a much broader view of what

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.400
[Amit Varma]: our justice system is like, what is the role the Supreme Court plays in it?

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.680
[Amit Varma]: What are its duties?

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.280
[Amit Varma]: What is it supposed to do?

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:05.240
[Amit Varma]: So now, you know, we can get a clearer sense of what is going wrong specifically now.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.740
[Amit Varma]: So take me back in time, like, you know, our modern justice system as it is now really

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.240
[Amit Varma]: came about in 1950, right?

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.240
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:19.560
[Guest]: So a little bit before that, in the sense that we had a functioning set of high courts,

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.920
[Guest]: and a federal court, which was called the British Federal Court, which eventually became

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.920
[Guest]: the Supreme Court.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.520
[Guest]: Of course, at the time, the British Federal Court was not the highest court of appeal,

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.640
[Guest]: the Privy Council in London was the highest court of appeal.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:37.400
[Guest]: So in that sense, you know, sort of the infrastructure we inherited from colonial times, but the

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:46.160
[Guest]: constitution making process from 1946 to 1950, one of the big differences, so as you know,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:52.360
[Guest]: India inherited or at least pretty much exactly adopted the existing parliamentary system,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.360
[Guest]: right?

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.760
[Guest]: So whatever was the British Westminster system was continued in India, and, you know, very

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.720
[Guest]: few tweaks were made to it.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:05.280
[Guest]: But there was one major difference from the colonial government, which is England does

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.320
[Guest]: not, or at least at that time, did not have independent judicial review.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.800
[Guest]: That is an American inheritance for us, right?

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.040
[Guest]: What we mean by independent judicial review is that the judiciary will provide a check

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:26.160
[Guest]: and a balance, both to the executive and to the legislature.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:32.440
[Guest]: So if the executive makes any kinds of actions, which are unconstitutional, the institution

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:38.320
[Guest]: that will adjudicate whether or not it is unconstitutional, and then nullify that particular

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.600
[Guest]: order is the judiciary.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.920
[Guest]: This comes from an old court case called Marbury versus Madison in America.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.840
[Guest]: That was the sort of the starting point of independent judicial review.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.320
[Guest]: Now in that particular case, it also applied to the legislature, right?

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.960
[Guest]: Now this was not true of England.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.480
[Guest]: The parliament could only, was sovereign in England, sovereign in the sense, you know,

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:09.440
[Guest]: in terms of checks and balances, and the courts could only review executive action, but they

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.720
[Guest]: could not review legislative action, right?

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.960
[Guest]: So this is one major difference between what was going on in England in 1950 and what was

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.360
[Guest]: happening in India in 1950.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:27.240
[Guest]: And Ambedkar, who of course studied at Columbia and a whole host of other legal minds in India

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.000
[Guest]: who were very inspired by the American system, thought that it is crucial to have independent

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.680
[Guest]: judicial review in a constitutional setup that guarantees fundamental rights.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:43.400
[Guest]: So you need to have writ jurisdiction, which means there are a host of writs that individuals

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:48.560
[Guest]: have where they can petition the court and say, my rights have been violated, and you

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:54.520
[Guest]: need to look into this matter and therefore either approve or nullify the executive action

00:16:54.520 --> 00:17:00.400
[Guest]: or the particular, you know, bill or act, which has violated my rights.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:07.480
[Guest]: Now, incidentally, the court took to this immediately and very quickly, like all the

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:13.120
[Guest]: justices who were justices at the time of the birth of the republic, they were very

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.480
[Guest]: well versed with what independent judicial review means, even though they hadn't come

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.040
[Guest]: from that system.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.800
[Guest]: So they knew how to interpret the law, they knew how to think about these principles,

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:29.680
[Guest]: and they knew that for the constitution to have any real value, you need to be able to

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:37.640
[Guest]: very clearly define when legislation and when executive action violates the constitution.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.440
[Guest]: And that's really where independent judicial review comes in from.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:45.400
[Guest]: Now, why is it important that this kind of judicial review is independent?

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:52.440
[Guest]: It is so that the judiciary is not subject to the arbitrary actions of the executive

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.040
[Guest]: for the legislature, right, that it has its own place.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.640
[Guest]: And one of the ways to make the judiciary independent is that its appointment procedure

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.940
[Guest]: is independent, right?

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.000
[Guest]: So that is really where this kind of system comes from.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000
[Guest]: Ambedkar was a very big advocate to push through this kind of independent judicial review.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.080
[Guest]: And he felt that the judiciary must be both independent of the executive, but it also

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.000
[Guest]: needs to be competent.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.720
[Guest]: So how do you balance these two things, right?

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:30.240
[Guest]: Now, the executive represents the people of India after being elected through the legislature.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.740
[Guest]: They are the people who really govern, so they are the ones in charge of the appointments.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:40.200
[Guest]: But how do we make sure that the people making appointments are also removed from the people

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.920
[Guest]: whom they appoint?

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.520
[Guest]: So there are a whole host of procedures to make sure that the judiciary is independent.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.680
[Guest]: One of these is that no high court or Supreme Court judge can be removed except for an impeachment

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.960
[Guest]: proceeding, right?

00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.080
[Guest]: So judicial officers at the highest courts can only be impeached, they can't just be,

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.040
[Guest]: you know, dismissed.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.640
[Guest]: And they have a term which ends when they reach the age of 62 in the case of the high

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.140
[Guest]: courts and 65 in the case of the Supreme Court.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:14.560
[Guest]: So they only retire based on their date of birth, right, they can't be manipulated and

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.840
[Guest]: forced to retire early or pushed or get an extension or retire later.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.480
[Guest]: So there were a bunch of safeguards like this.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:28.960
[Guest]: And the most important part of this procedure was Article 124 for the Supreme Court appointments

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:36.040
[Guest]: and Article 217 for the high court appointments, which basically said that the president shall

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.040
[Guest]: make the appointment.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:43.560
[Guest]: And when we say the president, we really mean the cabinet, and he shall do so in consultation

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.400
[Guest]: with the Chief Justice of India, right?

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:53.560
[Guest]: And now, for the last 70 plus years, there is a huge question over what is the meaning

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.880
[Guest]: of the word consultation, right?

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.440
[Guest]: In case of a disagreement, whose voice prevails?

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.360
[Guest]: You know, does the Chief Justice's view become binding?

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.080
[Guest]: Does the cabinet's view become binding?

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.920
[Guest]: And exactly how do you deal with this problem, right, when there is a disagreement?

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:17.480
[Guest]: So that has been sort of the centerpiece of independence of judiciary in India for the

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.300
[Guest]: last 70 years.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:24.240
[Amit Varma]: So let me try to kind of recap that and tell me if I understood it correctly.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:31.760
[Amit Varma]: Basically, it wasn't always the case that the judiciary is independent of both the executive

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.320
[Amit Varma]: and the legislature.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:38.700
[Amit Varma]: And what Ambedkar did was he followed the American precedent of making it independent

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.280
[Amit Varma]: of both the executive and the legislature and the purpose of the judiciary therefore

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:47.680
[Amit Varma]: became to ensure that the rules that were set in the Constitution and our laws applied

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:53.360
[Amit Varma]: to everybody equally, including the executive and the legislature, which brings about the

00:20:53.360 --> 00:21:00.840
[Amit Varma]: dilemma of how do you do this, if the judiciary itself is going to be appointed by the people

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.440
[Amit Varma]: who it's supposed to control?

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.160
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, you and I have discussed and this was again a question I had for a

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.840
[Amit Varma]: later part, but might as well bring it up now is that, you know, the same way that we

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.680
[Amit Varma]: apply public choice theory to governments where we talk about, you know, the incentives

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:21.360
[Amit Varma]: in play, a, I guess the same principles would apply to the judiciary and B, in this case,

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:28.840
[Amit Varma]: it would seem to me that the incentives for those in government would always be to select

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:35.120
[Amit Varma]: pliant judges, and then keep seeding the Supreme Courts and the high courts with pliant judges

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.000
[Amit Varma]: and manipulate the system in that way.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.160
[Amit Varma]: So what is sort of a history of those kinds of tensions playing out?

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.560
[Amit Varma]: And how has the judiciary stayed independent to begin with, for whatever time it did stay

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.560
[Guest]: independent?

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.560
[Guest]: So you have really hit the pulse of the matter.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.600
[Guest]: So you and I have talked a lot about, you know, what are the kind of rules in place

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.560
[Guest]: and what are the incentives based on the rules.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:06.960
[Guest]: But I want to also state the importance of convention and of statesman like leaders here

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.120
[Guest]: a little bit.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:13.840
[Guest]: So in the 1950s, you know, when, so what happened was that the Chief Justice of the British

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.340
[Guest]: Federal Court was Chief Justice Kanya, when we adopted the constitution.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.560
[Guest]: So the day we adopted the constitution, the British Federal Court became the Supreme Court

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.040
[Guest]: of India, and Chief Justice Kanya became the Chief Justice of India.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:34.840
[Guest]: Okay, when Chief Justice Kanya died in office soon after, the next most senior justice was

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.240
[Guest]: Justice Patanjali Shastri.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:42.120
[Guest]: Now it is believed that Nehru, who was at the time the Prime Minister and therefore

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:48.140
[Guest]: representing the cabinet, he preferred Justice MC Mahajan, who was at the Bombay High Court

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.860
[Guest]: at the time.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.640
[Guest]: And it was quite clear that that was his preference.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:59.460
[Guest]: But all the Supreme Court justices threatened to resign if the next most senior justice

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.560
[Guest]: did not automatically become the Chief Justice.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:08.000
[Guest]: And that is really the beginning of the convention that the next senior most justice will become

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.960
[Guest]: the Chief Justice and serve whether that term is for two days or for 10 years.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.100
[Guest]: You know, this is not written anywhere in the constitution, like there's no text that

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.680
[Guest]: supports this, but it is convention.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:26.640
[Guest]: And it is also like we must applaud Nehru that when he felt that there was pushback

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.720
[Guest]: from the judiciary on one of his decisions.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:34.680
[Guest]: And by the way, Justice MC Mahajan was a legendary judge, right?

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.680
[Guest]: This is a time actually when the Supreme Court of India, which used to be the British Federal

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.320
[Guest]: Court, was really not that important.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.760
[Guest]: You know, they were the highest court of appeal.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:48.360
[Guest]: They got very few cases, usually on like very boring matters of law.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:53.320
[Guest]: The busy and important courts for the high courts, they did the bulk of the work.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.720
[Guest]: So it was really your high court judges who were sort of superstars.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:04.280
[Guest]: And it seems like Nehru picked one such superstar, you know, who had, I mean, it's not like he

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:09.640
[Guest]: just picked some random client guy, like he was really, by any standards, an excellent

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.640
[Guest]: judge.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.840
[Guest]: But Nehru knew when to step back and respect the authority of institutions.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:21.160
[Guest]: And Nehru was so popular, frankly, he had said, yeah, go ahead and resign.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.560
[Guest]: You know, this is a country full of British trained lawyers.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.520
[Guest]: I can replace you guys tomorrow.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.200
[Guest]: He could have easily done that.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:34.240
[Guest]: But Nehru knew that there will never be respect for the Supreme Court if it wasn't viewed

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.920
[Guest]: as independent by all the stakeholders in society.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.840
[Guest]: So he knew when to step back.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:45.200
[Guest]: So I want to, you know, sort of emphasize the importance of convention here.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.560
[Guest]: It is very difficult to put down every rule in writing and then interpret every rule,

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.840
[Guest]: especially by the same court that, you know, needs to interpret the rule in its own matter.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.600
[Guest]: So in these kinds of situations, the convention really kicks in.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:09.440
[Guest]: And from 1951 to 1973, we had a very clear procedure of appointment.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.160
[Guest]: It was, of course, I mean, even in those years, there are some examples where it seems like

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.320
[Guest]: there's some executive influence.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:22.760
[Guest]: But it largely seems like very good, qualified people were appointed, that the Chief Justice

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:28.200
[Guest]: of India's opinion always had very, very high consideration or regard.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:33.880
[Guest]: And if there were politically motivated appointments or transfers, it wasn't a rampant thing.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.680
[Guest]: It might have been a one-off thing, right?

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.600
[Guest]: So that's the situation until 1973.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:45.720
[Guest]: Now, you and I have talked about, in an episode, we've talked about property rights for over

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.200
[Guest]: an hour.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.960
[Guest]: And if we just reference back to that episode, we talked about how the constitution kept

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:56.520
[Guest]: getting amended by the parliament, especially by the Indira Gandhi government, because the

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.720
[Guest]: judiciary kept interpreting the constitution as it is written, right?

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.960
[Guest]: So one of the consequences of that was that if you keep amending the constitution, the

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.320
[Guest]: courts are going to say, hey, this is very problematic.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:14.440
[Guest]: You can't just amend the constitution anytime we enforce the constitution.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:22.680
[Guest]: So in 1967, there's a case called Golaknath, where the Supreme Court in 11 judge bench

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.920
[Guest]: held that the constitution is unamendable by the parliament, that fundamental rights

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.160
[Guest]: cannot be amended.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.400
[Guest]: This was in 1967.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:37.520
[Guest]: Now the matter got appealed and in a case called Kesavanandarthi versus State of Kerala.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.360
[Guest]: And this was a 13 judge bench.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.720
[Guest]: Again, the question was, does the parliament have the authority to amend the constitution?

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:50.360
[Guest]: And this is the case where the basic structure doctrine was created and the court basically

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.880
[Guest]: said that the parliament has the authority to amend the constitution, but this is not

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.280
[Guest]: an unlimited authority.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:01.240
[Guest]: There is a core to the constitution that is inviolable and unamendable.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.280
[Guest]: We call that the basic structure.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.040
[Guest]: Basically it is things like federalism, democracy, secularism, independent judiciary, and so

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.040
[Guest]: on.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.920
[Guest]: And if the parliament amends any of these parts, we can strike down that constitutional

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.920
[Guest]: amendment.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.760
[Guest]: Now, the interesting thing is in this particular case, the court didn't say exactly what the

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.400
[Guest]: basic structure of the constitution is.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.960
[Guest]: They didn't give us a list, right?

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:28.680
[Guest]: They said, we will know when we see it, we'll decide on a case by case basis.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:34.560
[Guest]: There's a lot of politics and it's a fascinating story how this case came about, but the decision

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:41.640
[Guest]: was given on April 24, 1973, which was also the last date of the term of Chief Justice

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.160
[Guest]: Sikri.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:49.080
[Guest]: So Chief Justice Sikri knew that this is going to create a huge fallout.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:55.160
[Guest]: And as soon as it is announced, they wrote their separate opinions.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:01.160
[Guest]: Chief H.R. Khanna was one of the instrumental people in coming up with the basic structure

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.960
[Guest]: of the constitution.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.960
[Guest]: And it was a seven, six judgment.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:10.000
[Guest]: And there were like lots of dissenting opinions, really convoluted, it runs into thousands

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
[Guest]: of pages.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.760
[Guest]: And one of the justices who wholeheartedly was on the side of the government was Justice

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.360
[Guest]: A.N. Ray.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.640
[Guest]: So when Chief Justice Sikri retired, there were three justices, right?

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:29.320
[Guest]: Justice Shellach, Justice Grover, Justice Hegde, who were next in line.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.120
[Guest]: And then there was Justice A.N. Ray.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:38.560
[Guest]: Now Indira Gandhi, knowing that these justices had sided against the government in this particular

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:43.440
[Guest]: opinion, violated what is the fundamental principle of independent judiciary, which

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:48.360
[Guest]: is that justices must not be rewarded or penalized for their judicial opinions.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:54.640
[Guest]: So the day after Sikri retires, instead of appointing the next in line, she supersedes

00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:01.680
[Guest]: three senior judges and then appoints Justice A.N. Ray as the Chief Justice of India.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.720
[Guest]: And this is the first time anything like this had happened in India.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.900
[Guest]: It was like a complete shock.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.360
[Guest]: Of course, this is the time of like great statesman.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:18.440
[Guest]: And within a day, justices Shellach, Grover, Hegde, all of them resigned from the bench,

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.440
[Guest]: right?

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.720
[Guest]: So in a sense, Indira Gandhi got exactly what she wanted.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:26.180
[Guest]: She superseded three justices who were against her, which created three vacancies.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:31.200
[Guest]: And now she had A.N. Ray, who was known as her man, though it's not clear if there was

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.880
[Guest]: any specific reward and punishment system between A.N. Ray and the government.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:42.560
[Guest]: And she was hoping that A.N. Ray will reconstitute a bench within a month or so and re-look at

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.560
[Guest]: Keshavanand Bharti.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.600
[Guest]: Now, thankfully, that didn't happen.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.560
[Guest]: And that's a whole other story.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:53.720
[Guest]: But this is the first instance of this kind of seniority being violated.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:59.500
[Guest]: Indira Gandhi also started or at least pushed forth the trend of transferring justices when

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:04.040
[Guest]: they gave opinions against the government, right?

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:09.960
[Guest]: This is most evident in cases like ADM, Shivkanth Shukla.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:16.340
[Guest]: This is the habeas corpus case at the peak of the emergency, right?

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:21.760
[Guest]: And Justice Rangarajan, who was then the high court judge, who gave the judgment, was immediately

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:29.120
[Guest]: transferred to Guwahati High Court, which is kind of a penalty posting, as they say,

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.120
[Guest]: right?

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.600
[Guest]: There are some big high courts from where you typically get moved up, and that's what

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.080
[Guest]: happened to Justice Rangarajan.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.320
[Guest]: Justice HR Khanna, who when, you know, ADM Shivkanth Shukla was appealed to the Supreme

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:47.360
[Guest]: Court, he gave his opinion against the government and against the government actions and held

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.400
[Guest]: up the fundamental rights of individuals.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:57.080
[Guest]: And when he was the next senior most justice, he was superseded, right?

00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:03.160
[Guest]: So once again, Justice Baig, who was junior to Justice HR Khanna, was made chief justice

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.800
[Guest]: by superseding HR Khanna, immediately the day after HR Khanna resigned, right?

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:14.400
[Guest]: So there were these two instances where senior Supreme Court judges were superseded, where

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.720
[Guest]: justices at the high court and the Supreme Court were transferred for things that they,

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:24.440
[Guest]: you know, did in their professional capacity, enforcing independent judicial review, which

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.000
[Guest]: was their job.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.560
[Guest]: And this was really a huge attack on the institution of the independence of the judiciary.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:37.280
[Guest]: Meanwhile, during the emergency, the Indira Gandhi government also passed the 42nd Amendment,

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:43.360
[Guest]: which severely restricted independent judicial review, you know, and thankfully the emergency

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:51.320
[Guest]: ended and Janata government, which came in 77, 78, undid a lot of the 42nd Amendment

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.920
[Guest]: and the 43rd and 44th Amendment, and they restored all the rules of the judiciary back

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.480
[Guest]: to the 1950 set of rules, right?

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:06.560
[Guest]: So all the mischief was in some sense undone, but the judiciary has never recovered from

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:13.400
[Guest]: this blow in the sense that there is always a feeling that there is too much executive

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:20.680
[Guest]: interference and there's always a threat that if any Supreme Court or high court judge gives

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.720
[Guest]: an opinion that is against the government, the government uses all of its influence and

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:30.640
[Guest]: might to try to undermine the career of that particular judge or to transfer them or to

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.320
[Guest]: make sure that they are never appointed to the Supreme Court if they're a high court

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.060
[Guest]: judge and so on and so forth.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:42.280
[Guest]: So this is really the core of the fallout of the actions of Indira Gandhi, right?

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:48.320
[Guest]: So this stuff was brewing a little bit before her also, but before her, we had leaders who

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:54.480
[Guest]: were statesmen who knew when to stop, you know, the rules were equally unclear all along,

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.160
[Guest]: but the statesmen knew when to stop and when not to push.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.160
[Amit Varma]: So I have kind of three related questions.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.400
[Amit Varma]: And what you just said kind of brought me back to the sort of the first of them.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.360
[Amit Varma]: And I'll ask the first two together.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.840
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, you and I both agree, and we've often written about how democracies

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:17.280
[Amit Varma]: and systems of government can't rely on having good people and great leaders at the top.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:21.320
[Amit Varma]: Instead, what you need is good rules and good structures.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:26.440
[Amit Varma]: So that even if somebody who is a demagogue or a bad person comes to power, they can't

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.040
[Amit Varma]: really do much damage.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.240
[Amit Varma]: What is important are sort of the rules in place.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:36.080
[Amit Varma]: And the first part of this narrative about the independence of the judiciary seems to

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:42.500
[Amit Varma]: rely on, to begin with, in the first instance, the statesmanship of Nehru in letting that

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:47.920
[Amit Varma]: convention be established at the senior most judge be made the Chief Justice of India,

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.080
[Amit Varma]: and not insisting on Justice Mahajan getting that post.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And then that convention continues, because like you said that they were sort of all these

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.040
[Amit Varma]: statesmen who were doing the right thing.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.160
[Amit Varma]: But then the point is, you can't rely on statesmen doing the right thing for the system to work.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:07.320
[Amit Varma]: So my question, therefore, is that, again, like two questions.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:13.040
[Amit Varma]: Question number one, what kind of rules should there have been in place that could possibly

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.520
[Amit Varma]: have enforced that kind of independence of the judiciary, number one?

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:25.440
[Amit Varma]: And number two, how does it work in other countries, where also the judiciary is notionally

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.440
[Amit Varma]: independent?

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.360
[Amit Varma]: Like, would the US be an example of another such country?

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:34.600
[Amit Varma]: And there also the appointment of Supreme Court judges is very politicized, isn't it?

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.560
[Guest]: Yeah, so two things.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.520
[Guest]: So you're absolutely right, you know, you and I, because of our public choice, interest

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:46.760
[Guest]: and background, we focus on rules and institutions, and we say you can't rely on people.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.380
[Guest]: Having said that, people do interpret the rules, right?

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:55.600
[Guest]: So when there are good people, the same set of rules, good or bad, tend to come up with

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.240
[Guest]: slightly better outcomes than when they are bad people.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.400
[Guest]: But your larger point is absolutely right.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.920
[Guest]: Rules need to be robust to even the worst kind, right?

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.800
[Guest]: My dissertation advisor, Peter Bedke, always used to say, you don't write rules as if Mother

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.720
[Guest]: Teresa is going to enforce them.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.680
[Guest]: You write rules as if Joseph Stalin is going to enforce them.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.520
[Amit Varma]: So that still remains true.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:20.960
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example, what you pointed out earlier, you know, that the controversy over what does

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.480
[Amit Varma]: the word consultation mean and consultation with the CGI.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:30.320
[Amit Varma]: And I'd imagine that good well framed rules would not leave any ambiguity like that in

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.320
[Amit Varma]: the books.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.320
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.960
[Guest]: I mean, this is definitely a flaw in the text of the Constitution.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:42.520
[Guest]: I mean, it would be charitable to say that the framers goofed this up, but they really

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.680
[Guest]: did mess it up.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:48.840
[Guest]: You know, a consultation, deliberation, these are not the kinds of words that you want to

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.000
[Guest]: have in a constitutional document.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.800
[Guest]: You want to have very, very clear procedures on how people are appointed, right?

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:05.000
[Guest]: So second, if you do put in the word consultation because you want it to be an amicable decision

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.240
[Guest]: as opposed to, you know, pitting one institution against the other, you still need to clarify

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.280
[Guest]: who has supremacy in case of disagreement, right?

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:22.680
[Guest]: Now in any kind of panel, even judicial benches, we have an odd number of members on the panel.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.400
[Guest]: Now why do we do that?

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:29.160
[Guest]: Now in an ideal world, we would like opinions to be unanimous or not just have a narrow

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:34.040
[Guest]: majority, but we still have an odd number because if it's an even number, it could be

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.920
[Guest]: a split and then you don't know where to go from there, right?

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:44.760
[Guest]: So even our common sense panels and decisions always have odd numbers, right?

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:48.000
[Guest]: So now odd number panel, those are conventions.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.720
[Guest]: Those are not like they are not written in the text of the Constitution, but it's such

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.800
[Guest]: a strong and commonsensical and obvious convention.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.440
[Guest]: But the reason for the convention is to break deadlock, right?

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:04.000
[Guest]: So having words like consultation and not having a backup procedure to break deadlock

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.400
[Guest]: when the consultative process fails, in my opinion, that is probably the biggest flaw

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:18.020
[Guest]: in Article 124, Article 217 and Article 222, which is about transfer of judges.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:26.800
[Guest]: So one possible defense in the framers is that they were genuinely extraordinary statesmen.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:32.320
[Guest]: You know, the people who crafted our constitution, because they were surrounded by other people

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:40.280
[Guest]: like them who were so well-meaning and so well-educated and so public spirited in their

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.280
[Guest]: service.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:46.880
[Guest]: I think they imagined that is the quality of leaders we will elect and they didn't think

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:52.640
[Guest]: that there would be a possibility of future elected leaders who would be self-serving

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.760
[Guest]: and violate these documents so badly.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:00.640
[Guest]: So that is the most charitable thing I can say in defense of the framers.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.220
[Guest]: Now coming to your second question, you're absolutely right.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:10.000
[Guest]: It is complicated the world over, different countries have different procedures for appointment.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.580
[Guest]: In America, the way they have ensured judicial independence is to have a life term appointment

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.320
[Guest]: at the Supreme Court level, right?

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.520
[Guest]: And there are pros and cons of this kind of appointment.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:27.360
[Guest]: So the pro is once you get on the Supreme Court bench in the US Supreme Court, you serve

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:33.520
[Guest]: until the end of, you know, whenever you choose to step down for medical or health reasons

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.400
[Guest]: or when you die.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.080
[Guest]: So it's a life appointment, right?

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:44.480
[Guest]: And that means that justices can serve on the Supreme Court bench for 40 years, 50 years

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.920
[Guest]: if you appoint someone young, right?

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.920
[Guest]: So that's that.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:56.080
[Guest]: And over 50 years, you are going to give countless decisions every year, but you cannot be penalized

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.920
[Guest]: for any of those decisions, nor can you be rewarded for any of those decisions because

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.800
[Guest]: there is no job waiting for you after that.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:09.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but there the issue is that the post that the judge already holds is the reward,

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.080
[Amit Varma]: you know, being a judge on the Supreme Court, it's not as if they will do something with

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.720
[Amit Varma]: the expectation of reward after it, they've already got the reward, and they can be an

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.720
[Amit Varma]: implicit or explicit quid pro quo involved for that.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.720
[Guest]: So you know, that's the end.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.880
[Guest]: No one can hold you to it, right?

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:30.200
[Guest]: Like, let's say there were a whole group of like unsavory people who got me elected to

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.400
[Unknown]: the bench, right, or appointed to the bench.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:38.440
[Guest]: Now, because it's a life term appointment, I mean, if I choose to write what I choose

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.640
[Guest]: to write, so be it like they can't do anything after that.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:45.800
[Guest]: Right, they can't do anything to influence me after that, after that, I'm sort of in

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.800
[Guest]: a bubble.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:52.520
[Guest]: Now, it just so happens that the vetting process is so detailed, they pull out law review articles

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.760
[Guest]: and op-eds you wrote when you were 19 years old.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:02.000
[Guest]: And they're very, very, very careful that you hold the views that you say you hold.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.240
[Guest]: Having said that, if they appoint someone to the Supreme Court bench at age 45 or 50,

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:11.120
[Guest]: and it's a life appointment, and you're on the bench for the next 40 years, who says

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.360
[Guest]: you can't change your mind?

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.960
[Guest]: You know, who says you can't change your mind the very next day?

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.960
[Guest]: Now, the Indian Supreme Court works a little bit differently.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:25.240
[Guest]: The retirement age was 65, because at the time of the founding of the country, the life

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.480
[Guest]: expectancy wasn't that high.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:33.820
[Guest]: But today, 65 is a very low retirement age, given that life expectancy has increased.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:39.040
[Guest]: So what's happening is most Supreme Court judges take on some role immediately after

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.040
[Guest]: they retire from the Supreme Court, and it typically tends to be government tribunals

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.560
[Guest]: and panels.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.840
[Guest]: And guess who appoints people to the government tribunal and panels?

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.640
[Guest]: It's the executive.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:56.000
[Guest]: So now you have this very big problem of post-judicial appointments.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.280
[Guest]: And there has been some very interesting research on this particular issue.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.000
[Guest]: So I know we're reading a little bit of what we were talking about just a minute ago.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:14.400
[Guest]: But I want to emphasize that appointment procedure is not the only way to be independent.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.360
[Guest]: There are other important ways to be independent, which is what is the salary that is given

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.920
[Guest]: to a judge, which is whether judges are transferred between high courts, which doesn't happen

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.920
[Guest]: in America.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.920
[Guest]: Right?

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:29.600
[Guest]: I mean, every state is its own sort of like contained unit.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.760
[Guest]: You're not transferring judges from one state to another.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.920
[Guest]: So that is another kind of mechanism.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.600
[Guest]: And it's a lifetime appointment.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:43.240
[Guest]: So a couple of years ago, Madhav Ane, Shubhankar Dam and Giovanni Koh, they actually looked

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:50.840
[Guest]: at post-retirement appointments of Supreme Court judges and compared them to whether

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:56.040
[Guest]: these judges authored favorable judgments in important cases just before they retired.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.040
[Guest]: And guess what they find?

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I'd imagine the incentives play out as you'd expect them to play out, right?

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.320
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:07.200
[Guest]: They actually write favorable judgments because Supreme Court justices are also human.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:14.080
[Guest]: They want a nice house in, you know, Abdul Kalam Road with a car with a red light on

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:18.160
[Guest]: it and a whole staff and all the perks that come with it.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.800
[Guest]: And they're basically fitted on this tribunal or that tribunal, you know, Election Commission,

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.700
[Guest]: Right to Information Commission, this office, that office, there's a whole host of appointments

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:28.700
[Guest]: that is possible.

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:33.500
[Guest]: It makes a significant difference to the pay and the lifestyle of these justices.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:40.200
[Guest]: So while all the focus has been on appointment procedure alone, that is not the only way

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.200
[Guest]: to be independent.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:47.360
[Guest]: We have managed to create a very pliant judiciary even when the appointment procedure is not

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.560
[Guest]: interfered with, right?

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.000
[Guest]: By post-retirement carrots, so to speak.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.360
[Guest]: So there are many differences and there are many ways to skin this cat.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:04.120
[Guest]: So if you think about it, the U.S. Supreme Court has nominees are appointed by the executive,

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:09.680
[Guest]: but they are vetted by the legislature, which is you need a Senate confirmation hearing,

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.680
[Guest]: right?

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.800
[Guest]: So that is highly political process.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.640
[Guest]: It is not at all independent, but somehow it manages to protect the independence of

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:23.960
[Guest]: the judge once the judge is on the bench and becomes a Supreme Court justice, right?

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:30.520
[Guest]: So you can have a very political process and that still ensures independence, or you can

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:35.680
[Guest]: have a very insular process, which is completely separate from the politics and still have

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.760
[Guest]: a not so independent system.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:44.520
[Amit Varma]: So in fact, looking at our system, it would actually be remarkable to me if our judiciary

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.120
[Amit Varma]: was independent.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:51.960
[Amit Varma]: It seems it's designed to set up a dependence of the judiciary on the executive.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:52.960
[Amit Varma]: What do you think?

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.760
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sure this has been discussed massively over the last few decades.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:03.280
[Amit Varma]: So what are the kind of steps that could have been taken or could be taken to make independence

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.600
[Amit Varma]: more likely?

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.120
[Guest]: So again, I want to take you back a little bit to the history of what happened, you know,

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:16.520
[Guest]: so post Indira Gandhi's actions in the 70s and the horror of the emergency, transferring

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:23.280
[Guest]: so many judges during the emergency really became like a farce, what was going on.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:27.960
[Guest]: The legal community thought that it needs to do something, right?

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:33.160
[Guest]: So there were a series of challenges on appointment procedure, because, you know, it became very

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:37.560
[Guest]: clear that the appointment and the transfer procedure is not very clear and we need to

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.320
[Guest]: come up with something.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:43.400
[Guest]: So the first of these cases is called the first judges case.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.840
[Guest]: It was in 1982, S.P. Gupta versus Union of India.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:52.560
[Guest]: And in this particular case, the court was asked, so exactly what does this consultative

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.720
[Guest]: process mean, right?

00:44:54.720 --> 00:45:00.680
[Guest]: So the court simply said that it limited the unfettered power of the executive, right?

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:07.960
[Guest]: The consultation should be full, the chief justice's opinion must be recorded, it must

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.920
[Guest]: be considered, it can't be easily disregarded.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:16.120
[Guest]: Having said that, the chief justice of India's opinion on appointments and transfers is not

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.120
[Guest]: binding.

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.120
[Guest]: Right?

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.120
[Guest]: So that was the first judges case.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:24.560
[Guest]: Now, this is a very traditional interpretation because nowhere in the constitution does it

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.920
[Guest]: seem to suggest that the judiciary's opinion on appointments should be binding.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:34.440
[Guest]: So in a sense, even in the 1980s, the Supreme Court justices were not very activist and

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:38.280
[Guest]: still conservative and they were interpreting the text of the constitution.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:44.360
[Guest]: But as we know, since the 80s, after post-emergency, there was like a two-year Janata government

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.360
[Guest]: period.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.440
[Guest]: And then after that, it was back to politics as usual.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.880
[Guest]: So all the usual shenanigans started.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.400
[Guest]: And there was a really important question of how do we really protect the independence

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.800
[Guest]: of judges?

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.480
[Guest]: And this brings me to the second judges case, right?

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:05.980
[Guest]: This was a case in 93, and it was basically the legal community, the Supreme Court's advocates

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:13.760
[Guest]: on record who questioned once again, the existing procedure in articles 124, 217, and 222, right?

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.400
[Guest]: And they said, there are poor procedural safeguards.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.360
[Guest]: So what do we do now?

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:23.640
[Guest]: This is perhaps the most activist judicial opinion written, not just by the Supreme Court

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:27.320
[Guest]: of India, but any court anywhere in the world, right?

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.880
[Guest]: They basically created a new procedure to appoint Supreme Court and high court judges

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.920
[Guest]: out of thin air.

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:37.560
[Guest]: And if you compare the procedure to what is the text of the constitution, you will think

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.480
[Guest]: you are in two different countries and the pages got mixed up.

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.480
[Guest]: Okay.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:46.280
[Guest]: So what they did was they said, we're going to create a collegium system.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:52.680
[Guest]: The collegium is led by the Supreme Court of India and two of the senior most judges.

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:58.600
[Guest]: And these three people will come up with a list of who needs to be appointed and who

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.280
[Guest]: needs to be transferred.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:05.960
[Guest]: And they will give this list to the cabinet or the president who actually, in whose name

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:11.720
[Guest]: the appointments are made and their recommendations are binding and they cannot be violated.

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.720
[Guest]: Okay.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:17.800
[Guest]: Now, as you can see, this is a drastically different system from what was actually written

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.720
[Guest]: in text.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.120
[Guest]: Some people thought this was the most amazing thing that had ever happened.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:28.780
[Guest]: And the judiciary had finally come of age and declared its own independence.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:34.400
[Guest]: Many others felt that this is outrageous and very self-serving activism.

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:39.160
[Guest]: And this is going to create a situation where there is no external scrutiny or check on

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.160
[Guest]: the judiciary.

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:44.000
[Guest]: And it's basically a self-appointing system, right?

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.160
[Guest]: Only the current chief justice of India determines who are the next people who rise to the bench.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.160
[Guest]: So it's extremely problematic.

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.000
[Guest]: A presidential reference was made in 1998.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.080
[Guest]: The president of India can ask the Supreme Court to clarify on matters of law or national

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.720
[Guest]: importance and so on.

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:07.680
[Guest]: And this presidential reference in 1998, again, the court put in a few more safeguards to

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.680
[Guest]: this collegium system.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.080
[Guest]: So it's called the third judge's case.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.960
[Guest]: So they added some more safeguards to the second judge's case.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:16.440
[Guest]: They said that, you know, the collegium must meet and the minutes must be recorded.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.580
[Guest]: It must be a transparent system.

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:22.800
[Guest]: And the collegium is going to be not this chief justice of India plus two judges, but

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.980
[Guest]: chief justice of India and the next four senior most judges.

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.880
[Guest]: So the collegium will have five people, right?

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:34.120
[Guest]: And this will be the group that determines who is appointed and who will be promoted

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.160
[Guest]: to the Supreme Court and so on.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:41.760
[Guest]: And they will give their list to cabinet and the president will make these appointments.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.520
[Guest]: Now once again, coming to the importance of convention, when all this was happening in

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:52.360
[Guest]: 1998, you can imagine that if it had been Indira Gandhi, who was the prime minister,

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:56.120
[Guest]: she would have just shut the whole thing down, right?

00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:02.200
[Guest]: But it just so happened that people who had lived through the emergency and, you know,

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:07.120
[Guest]: better, more statesmen leaders were beginning to come to power.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:11.240
[Guest]: And immediately after that is the time of Vajpayee, right?

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.400
[Guest]: And it seems to be quite clear that everyone in the executive thought that this is a very

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:21.160
[Guest]: bad idea, but they shouldn't mess with the independence of the judiciary.

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.960
[Guest]: And they should respect this opinion, right?

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.160
[Guest]: So presidential reference was made.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.600
[Guest]: Once the Supreme Court clarified the matter, the matter was left alone.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:38.760
[Guest]: So from 1993 until 2015, we had a second system of appointments, which was by collegium.

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:44.040
[Guest]: And before that, you know, from 1951 to 1993 was the first system of appointments, which

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.840
[Guest]: was by consultation, right?

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.600
[Guest]: Aside from the shenanigans of Indira Gandhi.

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.920
[Guest]: So this was really what was going on.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:57.720
[Guest]: Now you don't need much of a legal education to guess what would happen in a system like

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:58.720
[Guest]: this.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:04.600
[Guest]: So, you know, the usual, which is nepotism, which is not the most qualified people rising

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.960
[Guest]: to the bench, but people who have connections, right?

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:14.000
[Guest]: So if you have served and you had on good relationships with the sort of like the elite

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:21.960
[Guest]: judicial coterie, then you are promoted, a lot of children and grandchildren and siblings

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:25.840
[Guest]: of past justices were promoted and they rose to the top.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:31.360
[Guest]: And some internal corruption really started setting into the court system.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:35.720
[Guest]: So there was a time when the court system was really beyond reproach.

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:40.280
[Guest]: You know, giants had served on the court and they were really, they held themselves to

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.480
[Guest]: such a high standard and never put a foot out of place.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:49.160
[Guest]: And it was really important that they not only did what is right, but also seemed to

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.480
[Guest]: do what is right, which is, you know, hold themselves to a higher standard.

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:57.080
[Guest]: Now, all of them that started disappearing under the collegium system and it became quite

00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:02.680
[Guest]: clear that the Supreme Court and all the judges were a little bit like, you know, power drunk

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:05.000
[Guest]: and they thought they could do whatever they wanted.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.520
[Guest]: This is, you know, the eighties, nineties, and since the 2000s, especially the nineties

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:14.440
[Guest]: and the 2000s is also the most activist form of the judiciary.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:19.800
[Guest]: So the Supreme Court butts its head into every policy matter.

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:24.240
[Guest]: It is legislating from the bench, it passes daily orders on all matters from taxation,

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:30.260
[Guest]: which was never under its purview to the powers of pretty much every other institution, right?

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:37.560
[Guest]: So the Supreme Court has become its own powerful giant and this entire, you know, sort of jugglery

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:42.200
[Guest]: trick worked because the people had a lot of faith in the institution.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:45.880
[Guest]: So as long as the public supports you, in a sense, you can sort of get away with a lot

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:48.880
[Guest]: of procedural problems, right?

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:53.600
[Guest]: So the people of India thought the Supreme Court is this hallowed institution and that's

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:58.480
[Guest]: really where we get justice through specially petitions and public interest litigations

00:51:58.480 --> 00:51:59.800
[Guest]: and all of those things.

00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.420
[Guest]: And it seems to be the last uncorrupted bastion.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.800
[Guest]: So the Supreme Court got away with this for a long time.

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:12.800
[Guest]: And then once the corruption started becoming more and more public is when, you know, sort

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.360
[Guest]: of the music stopped and you had to take stock.

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.560
[Amit Varma]: So before we go to that part of the story, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:25.560
[Amit Varma]: And then when we come back, I also want to ask you more about the activism of the court,

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.360
[Amit Varma]: the legislating from the bench, so to speak.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:34.360
[Unknown]: But first, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.480
[Unknown]: So, welcome back to India's Gram Sabhas, one of India's biggest democratic successes since

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.480
[Unknown]: independence.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.220
[Unknown]: On Simplified, Chuck and Naren go back in time and talk about moments when human activity

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.700
[Unknown]: influenced a change on the earth's geology and ecosystems.

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:12.700
[Unknown]: On Equity Sahiye, brought to you by Motilal Oswald, Shrey Lunkar joins Anupam to discuss

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:14.700
[Unknown]: the Indian automobile sector.

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:18.540
[Unknown]: On Know Your Kanun, Ambar Rana gets into the details of defamation and its exceptions under

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:19.540
[Unknown]: the law.

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:23.740
[Unknown]: On Water Player, Siddharth and Mikhail are previewing the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:24.740
[Unknown]: along with their predictions.

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:28.260
[Unknown]: And with that, let's go on with your show.

00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:29.540
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:34.420
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Shruti Rajgopalan about the state of our judiciary.

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:38.380
[Amit Varma]: And my next question following on from what you were speaking about before the break is

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.180
[Amit Varma]: really about judicial activism.

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:44.380
[Amit Varma]: I mean, forgive the newbie question, but my impression of the judiciary always was that

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:50.100
[Amit Varma]: look, the judges are basically supposed to interpret what the laws are or what the Constitution

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:53.260
[Amit Varma]: says and their judgments are on the basis of that.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:58.260
[Amit Varma]: Their own opinions don't really matter, they can't, to use that phrase, legislate from

00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.260
[Amit Varma]: the bench.

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:01.220
[Amit Varma]: It's the job of the legislature to legislate.

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:06.340
[Amit Varma]: And what the Supreme Court simply does is that it interprets existing laws and the Constitution

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.340
[Amit Varma]: and pass the judgments based on that.

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:14.480
[Amit Varma]: Now, a number of the judgments that we've spoken about in this episode, whether it's,

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.180
[Amit Varma]: for example, the basic structure judgment, where I wonder on the basis of what do they

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:22.300
[Amit Varma]: decide what the basic structure is of the Constitution doesn't mention that, or the

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:27.460
[Amit Varma]: 1993 second judge's case, where they decide that there should be a collegium and this

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:32.140
[Amit Varma]: is a procedure and blah, blah, blah, on the basis of what do they decide that or even

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:37.740
[Amit Varma]: the Vishakha judgment, which both of us agree is excellent and a really positive move forward.

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:41.900
[Amit Varma]: But on the basis of what do they arrive at something, because the point is that once

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:47.660
[Amit Varma]: you accept that the judges have a right to sort of legislate from the bench as it were,

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:52.500
[Amit Varma]: then depending on which people are on the bench, they can legislate absolutely anything,

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:53.500
[Amit Varma]: right?

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.500
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:57.460
[Guest]: So, you know, there are two, three different views on this.

00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:01.820
[Guest]: And I finally come to the point that no matter which view you take, the Indian Supreme Court

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:03.780
[Guest]: is still doing the wrong thing.

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:04.780
[Guest]: Okay.

00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:11.540
[Guest]: So the first view is, look, it is always the job of the court to be conservative and not

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:12.540
[Guest]: activist.

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:14.260
[Guest]: And what do we mean by activists?

00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:19.320
[Guest]: Now there are two ways to think about the role of the judiciary, right?

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:22.560
[Guest]: So the first is it provides a check and balance.

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:27.340
[Guest]: So you know, whatever the executive and the legislature do to preserve principles of natural

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:32.220
[Guest]: justice and the spirit of the constitution, you need to provide a valid check.

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:37.300
[Guest]: Now, based on this kind of interpretation, if your legislature and executive are going

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:42.200
[Guest]: bonkers, it means your judiciary can go bonkers, right?

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:47.460
[Guest]: So if you have a legislature, which is repeatedly amends the constitution, then you're going

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:55.860
[Guest]: to end up placing the judiciary in a situation where they may also have to exceed their powers

00:56:55.860 --> 00:57:01.380
[Guest]: a little bit or their original powers a little bit, or get more creative with their interpretation

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:05.940
[Guest]: to actually give a solid check to the legislature and the executive.

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:12.620
[Guest]: So this kind of activism, most legal scholars are quite comfortable with in the sense that

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:19.500
[Guest]: they feel that the job of the judiciary is to really pursue in a very spirited way, really

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:23.820
[Guest]: pursue the protection of individual rights and the constitution.

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:29.700
[Guest]: So in this sense, a lot of the activism that happens during the emergency, you know, like

00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:37.180
[Guest]: Justice HR Khanna's opinion in Keshavanand Bharti or Jabalpur versus ADM Shivkanth Shukla.

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:42.280
[Guest]: These are all legendary cases where there could have been a textbook interpretation

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.980
[Guest]: and they went a step ahead of the textbook interpretation.

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:50.420
[Guest]: But the goal was still to protect individual rights and it wasn't self-serving in the sense

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:52.700
[Guest]: that it wasn't increasing the power of the judiciary.

00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:56.900
[Amit Varma]: So basically by the spirit of the book, if not the actual words, because the actual words

00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:59.020
[Guest]: can be changed at any point.

00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:00.020
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:02.620
[Guest]: Now there's another version of what is the role of the judiciary.

00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:04.180
[Guest]: So first is checks and balances, right?

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:10.380
[Guest]: The second part of it is a very Adam Smith division of labor kind of view of the judiciary.

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:14.780
[Guest]: In fact, Adam Smith writes about this in The Wealth of Nations, that there are two roles.

00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:19.260
[Guest]: One is the functional task, which is, you know, the judiciary's job is really to go

00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:23.580
[Guest]: through a lot of evidence procedure and actually adjudicate.

00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:26.580
[Guest]: And that's a highly specialized task, right?

00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:31.420
[Guest]: The legislature's job is to amalgamate preferences of millions of people.

00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:33.300
[Guest]: And that's the legislature's job.

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:40.260
[Guest]: The executive's job is to execute the goals of the government, you know, as conveyed by

00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.900
[Guest]: the legislature or the preferences of the people.

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.940
[Guest]: So these are three very fundamentally different tasks.

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:51.760
[Guest]: You know, this is as different as the butcher, the brewer and the baker.

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:58.540
[Guest]: So in that sense, the one way to think about judicial activism is you're really doing jobs

00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:04.180
[Guest]: which are outside your expertise and outside your purview, which is why you must be limited.

00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:10.380
[Guest]: So you know, things like fiscal matters, about taxation, about government spending, about,

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.740
[Guest]: you know, I'll give you a good example of this.

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:15.420
[Guest]: Now think of the CNG cases.

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:20.740
[Guest]: Do you remember when they changed all the fleet of buses in Delhi and then eventually

00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:24.540
[Guest]: in other states from diesel to CNG?

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:25.540
[Amit Varma]: Do you have any?

00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:26.540
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I remember this.

00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.540
[Amit Varma]: It happened.

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:28.540
[Amit Varma]: I am fairly old.

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:29.540
[Amit Varma]: So this happened in the early 2000s.

00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:30.540
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:32.940
[Guest]: No, but I mean, you're also not from Delhi.

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:35.780
[Guest]: So you know, you may have not really lived through it.

00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:40.100
[Guest]: So this was when the early 2000s, I was in high school, just starting college.

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:46.180
[Guest]: Overnight, the court just, you know, there were a series of cases by MC Mehta, who was

00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:47.940
[Guest]: sort of like this environmental activist.

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:51.460
[Guest]: And he said, you know, people of Delhi can't breathe, and you can imagine he said this

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:52.460
[Guest]: like 20 years ago.

00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:53.460
[Guest]: Right.

00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.460
[Guest]: Can you imagine what they would say today?

00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:59.900
[Guest]: They said the biggest problem is all the particulate matter that comes out of these diesel buses.

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:04.020
[Guest]: We need to make sure that all the diesel buses change to CNG overnight.

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.020
[Guest]: Okay.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:09.940
[Guest]: Now think about what it takes to change an entire fleet of government and private buses.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:10.940
[Guest]: You need an infrastructure.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.660
[Guest]: First of all, these buses need to exist.

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.340
[Guest]: Then you need to refit them.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:23.340
[Guest]: Once you refit them, every petrol pump in the city needs to outfit itself with a CNG

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.340
[Guest]: station.

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.340
[Guest]: Right.

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:30.140
[Guest]: Now, the court simply said, change 10,000 buses to CNG.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.720
[Guest]: They gave them a deadline.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.420
[Guest]: The Delhi government violated the deadline.

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:36.020
[Guest]: They gave them a second deadline, the Delhi government violated the deadline.

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:41.780
[Guest]: Supreme Court got so sick of the Delhi government, they just said, diesel buses cannot fly after

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.700
[Guest]: such and such date.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:46.460
[Guest]: And overnight it was like a Soviet Union.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:47.460
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:53.700
[Guest]: I mean, there were no buses and all the autos and buses, we, even the ones that had CNG,

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:59.620
[Guest]: the lines outside the petrol stations and the CNG stations were, I mean, you really

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.820
[Guest]: thought you're living in a shortage Soviet style economy.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:09.820
[Guest]: Like these four auto rickshaw and bus drivers would stand in line for three or four days

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:13.500
[Guest]: to get one tank full of CNG and then continue again.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:18.820
[Guest]: So now if you think about this from the point of view of the, you know, functional separation

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:24.020
[Guest]: of powers, not just the checks and balances, this is about specialization and knowledge,

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.020
[Guest]: right?

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:29.740
[Guest]: The courts, which basically adjudicate disputes, which are over a matter of fact or matter

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:35.900
[Guest]: of law, they simply don't know how to execute a transition from system A to system B, which

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.940
[Guest]: is a question of governance.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:40.780
[Guest]: That is squarely in the pocket of the executive.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:45.140
[Guest]: The court said, Oh, we didn't know that, you know, there will be the CNG problem.

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.580
[Guest]: It's like a classic knowledge problem, right?

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:51.860
[Guest]: Of course you can overnight convert and say the buses are going to run on CNG, but you

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:57.180
[Guest]: can't produce CNG out of thin air and make it available exactly where the people need

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.620
[Guest]: it to be available.

01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:03.580
[Guest]: This would have required the Delhi state government issuing new licenses to all the petrol pumps,

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.060
[Guest]: creating new petrol pumps with CNG.

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:08.860
[Guest]: You know, it's a whole infrastructure that takes place and the government knew about

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.860
[Guest]: it.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:13.820
[Guest]: And it's so funny that the Supreme Court justices who are very smart people didn't know about

01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:17.420
[Guest]: it because it's simply not within their purview to know this.

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:22.540
[Guest]: On the second matter, which is this question of, you know, the functional knowledge to

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:28.980
[Guest]: execute on some of these tasks, those are the more like very problematic questions of

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.500
[Guest]: judicial interference or judicial activism.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.180
[Guest]: You have ludicrous examples of this.

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:40.140
[Guest]: So the Delhi High Court at one point was trying to legislate or standardize the height of

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.460
[Guest]: speed breakers in Delhi.

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:46.500
[Guest]: Is it really the job of the courts to decide what the height of speed breakers is?

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.060
[Guest]: And I'll tell you how the matter came about.

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:53.900
[Guest]: Resident welfare associations were randomly building speed breakers near schools or in

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:56.860
[Guest]: front of their house to reduce the number of accidents, right?

01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:02.180
[Guest]: Because we have such poor sort of traffic rule following spirit in India.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:07.140
[Guest]: So people were doing all this and they realized that all the speed breakers are of uneven

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:10.940
[Guest]: heights, which apparently is a matter of national importance.

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:15.100
[Guest]: Someone filed a public interest litigation and the public interest litigation now decided

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:20.780
[Guest]: whether or not you can have speed breakers and how high these speed breakers should be.

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:25.380
[Guest]: And you think about it and you're like, really, the pendency of cases is extraordinary at

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:26.380
[Guest]: this point.

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:32.140
[Guest]: There are people in jail who are being deprived of their rights because the cases are going

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:33.140
[Guest]: on for too long.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:37.860
[Guest]: There are land dispute cases where the original parties to the case have died waiting for

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:38.860
[Guest]: justice.

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:43.460
[Guest]: And the Supreme Court thinks that the most important thing is to legislate from the bench

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:49.740
[Guest]: on CNG and the, you know, Delhi Bird Sanctuary and the air quality and the height of speed

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:50.740
[Guest]: breakers.

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:53.900
[Guest]: And this list has become extremely long.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:59.300
[Guest]: There is virtually no area of Indian governance where the Supreme Court has not given its

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:01.100
[Guest]: opinion one way or another.

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:05.540
[Amit Varma]: I'm having this very funny image of Supreme Court judges in their black robes measuring

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:11.580
[Amit Varma]: the height of speed breakers on Delhi streets as CNG autos whizz by and a classic example

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:16.340
[Amit Varma]: of this in a domain which I know fairly well is the interference of the Supreme Court and

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:19.580
[Amit Varma]: the BCCI in Indian cricket.

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:24.940
[Amit Varma]: What the COA is doing where they're completely clueless about how to run Indian cricket and

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:28.780
[Amit Varma]: I don't even know whether they actually have the jurisdiction to interfere in the way they

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.220
[Amit Varma]: are, but that's a separate issue.

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.220
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:37.780
[Guest]: And it just so happened that, you know, the people of India are so tired of waiting for

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:44.340
[Guest]: procedures and governance and they're so exhausted by executive inaction that they think they

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.420
[Guest]: have no choice but to go to the court.

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:50.060
[Guest]: I'll give you another example of activism in the Supreme Court.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.060
[Guest]: Okay.

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:53.060
[Guest]: And how this activism can be very problematic.

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:58.740
[Guest]: So one of the reasons that the activism started in the 1980s was as a social justice program,

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:03.220
[Guest]: you know, bonded laborers, you know, this is a Badua Mukti Mocha case that came out

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.620
[Guest]: of the mining community.

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:12.780
[Guest]: They were like mine workers and bonded laborers who were just living like such a horror in

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:15.100
[Guest]: their daily life and their workplace.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:18.940
[Guest]: And they didn't have much voice or agency, right?

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:23.340
[Guest]: And through a series of cases, the court started interfering and actually assigning positive

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.340
[Guest]: rights.

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:28.820
[Guest]: And another very interesting thing that the Supreme Court did at the time was it reduced

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:32.500
[Guest]: what is called the locus standi requirement, right?

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:38.300
[Guest]: Normally in any court case, the parties to the case need to show that they have standing.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:42.620
[Guest]: You know, if you wanted to use a very contemporary economic term, it would be skin in the game,

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.620
[Guest]: right?

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:47.940
[Guest]: They have to show that they're actually affected parties in this particular dispute and that's

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:49.620
[Guest]: why they're coming to court.

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:53.420
[Guest]: Now the court said, you know, a lot of the people who are deprived of human rights, like

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:58.420
[Guest]: children, like minorities, Dalits, bonded laborers, they really don't have the agency

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.780
[Guest]: to come forward and represent themselves.

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:05.580
[Guest]: So if a public interested or public spirited human being came to represent them, we will

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:06.580
[Guest]: allow it.

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.580
[Guest]: Right?

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.660
[Guest]: Now you can imagine this is such a great thing, right?

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:14.900
[Guest]: I mean, like diluting locus standing so that we can help slum dwellers and we can help

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:20.980
[Guest]: bonded laborers seems like such a, it seems like activism, but the right kind of activism.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:24.220
[Guest]: Now let me explain the problem with this.

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:29.300
[Guest]: Random people come out of the woodwork representing problems where they are not directly affected,

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.300
[Guest]: right?

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:34.820
[Guest]: And if you represent problems where you're not directly affected, one, there is an incentive

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:38.140
[Guest]: problem, but there is also a knowledge problem.

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:44.300
[Guest]: Delhi lawyers who live in elite Delhi areas and Delhi judges who don't take auto rickshaws

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:49.940
[Guest]: and don't take buses are legislating on matters where they have no skin in the game and they

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:52.900
[Guest]: have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:56.080
[Guest]: And the other side parties end up being underrepresented.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.820
[Guest]: Now let me give you the worst example of diluting locus standard requirements.

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:07.100
[Guest]: Now if you remember our entire journey in our country with section 377, originally the

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:14.840
[Guest]: Delhi high court in the NAS foundation case had struck down 377 and upheld the right to

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:18.140
[Guest]: same sex consensual relationships, right?

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:20.320
[Guest]: This was a Delhi high court judgment.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:24.600
[Guest]: This court appealed to the Supreme court and the Supreme court overturned it, right?

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:29.220
[Guest]: This was all the drama that took place before what happened last year.

01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:32.860
[Guest]: Now if you look at Supreme court overturning the Delhi high court case and you actually

01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:37.540
[Guest]: look into the matter, you'll notice that NAS foundation did not appeal the Delhi high court

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:38.540
[Guest]: judgment.

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:39.540
[Guest]: Okay.

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:43.860
[Guest]: The government at the time, which was the UPA government and the Delhi government did

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:46.420
[Guest]: not appeal the case, even though they lost.

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:51.180
[Guest]: They said, you know, the courts have spoken, we leave it be, we are okay with 377 being

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:52.940
[Guest]: struck down.

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:58.980
[Guest]: The person who actually appealed the case was a Hindu astrologer.

01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:04.840
[Guest]: Second, this Hindu astrologer was not a party to the original suit.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:11.860
[Guest]: So it's like there are two, you know, teams playing cricket and now someone who was neither

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:16.580
[Guest]: a player, nor the umpire, nor the spectator, but was, you know, standing and eating mangoes

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:21.420
[Guest]: outside suddenly comes in and says, I think this game and its outcome was unfair.

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:26.600
[Guest]: And the court heard it and they had to, because they are bound now by their own precedent

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.900
[Guest]: of diluting standing requirements.

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:32.420
[Guest]: And if anyone can come and appeal anything, guess what?

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:34.940
[Guest]: Anyone will come and appeal anything.

01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:39.700
[Guest]: And that is so according to me, that Supreme court case was not just bad law, it was bad

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:44.220
[Guest]: procedure because they just randomly allowed, you know, a third party who had nothing to

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:49.620
[Guest]: do with the case to come in a little too late and they heard the appeal and then they overturned

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:50.620
[Guest]: the case.

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:55.300
[Guest]: So according to me, you know, all the activism of the Supreme court got in the way of all

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:57.500
[Guest]: the activism of the Supreme court, right?

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:01.940
[Guest]: This is the problem with having these terrible inconsistent set of rules and not binding

01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:03.700
[Guest]: yourself with procedure.

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:08.460
[Guest]: So when you're asking broader question of judicial activism, some of it has held us

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:15.040
[Guest]: in good stead because I have to say in a world where no other institution was really checking

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:19.540
[Guest]: the power of the government, it was only the judiciary.

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:24.340
[Guest]: Now the poor outcome of that is the judiciary grew too big for its own boots.

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:29.940
[Guest]: It interfered in everything from the speaker's powers to election commission, to how parliament

01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:33.620
[Guest]: must be run, to how tax policy must be made.

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:41.060
[Guest]: Now we are in a giant mess where it is very difficult to roll back this kind of authority

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:45.060
[Guest]: without actually interfering with the independence of the courts.

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:48.700
[Guest]: And so now what do we do is kind of the big question going forward.

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:52.180
[Amit Varma]: So our problem is really now a who will watch the watchman kind of problem.

01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.700
[Amit Varma]: I just wanted to complete your thought.

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:57.540
[Amit Varma]: I think we kind of got waylaid where you were saying that there are three views on judicial

01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:58.880
[Amit Varma]: activism.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.460
[Amit Varma]: One was checks and balances, that they act as a balance on an overactive executive.

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:06.940
[Amit Varma]: And the second is the whole division of labor thing.

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:07.940
[Guest]: Oh yes.

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:09.660
[Guest]: And the third, I forgot to mention the third.

01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:14.180
[Guest]: The third is that the activism must not be self-serving.

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:19.720
[Guest]: You know, there was a lot of support for the Supreme Court activism as long as it was advocating

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.140
[Guest]: genuinely for the powers of others.

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:25.460
[Guest]: You know, the Vishakha case is a classic example.

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.420
[Guest]: Did they legislate from the bench?

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:28.420
[Guest]: Yes.

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:31.580
[Guest]: As a constitutional economist, do I think that's a good idea?

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:32.580
[Guest]: Absolutely not.

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:33.580
[Guest]: Right.

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:38.580
[Guest]: But was that public support and intellectual support and legal support for the case?

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:39.580
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:42.940
[Guest]: I mean, worldwide, it was a landmark judgment.

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:47.700
[Guest]: It has been cited in opinions in Europe, in America, in Africa.

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:54.220
[Guest]: It's really an extraordinary case in the sense that the court stepped up when virtually no

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.100
[Guest]: other public institutions stepped up.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.820
[Guest]: And frankly, they made rules, right?

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:01.980
[Guest]: They put in rules and guidelines, which is what the courts do from time to time.

01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:03.340
[Guest]: They fill in gaps in law.

01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:07.380
[Guest]: Now, in this case, of course, they created law from scratch, but it is still somewhat

01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:11.420
[Guest]: within their functional expertise, but it was not self-serving, right?

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:16.540
[Guest]: If you look at the second and third judge's case, it's a completely self-serving document,

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:17.540
[Guest]: right?

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.140
[Guest]: It is all about their power.

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:20.360
[Guest]: Now think about it.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:26.340
[Guest]: If you were genuinely interested in independence of judiciary, wouldn't you increase retirement

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:31.140
[Guest]: age and completely ban Supreme Court justices from taking any government appointment after

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:33.700
[Guest]: their term is over?

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:36.860
[Guest]: That is crucial to independence, right?

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:39.620
[Guest]: But they don't really care about independence.

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:43.700
[Guest]: They care about the fact that they should be allowed to do whatever they want, but also

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.100
[Guest]: have their cake and eat it too, right?

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:49.580
[Guest]: So if they want to go the other way and lobby for some government posting, they should be

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.260
[Guest]: allowed to do that too.

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:55.680
[Guest]: So I think the court has been very self-serving and disingenuous.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:01.500
[Guest]: So in some sense, this is not so much about rules and checks and balances, but about the

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.940
[Guest]: functional legitimacy of the court.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:09.740
[Guest]: People are more likely to accept an activist court than the activist court is once again

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:16.820
[Guest]: run by statesmen who know when to do the right thing, and we have not had those people.

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:20.340
[Guest]: Now the public choice in you and me would say, hey, these horrible rules would never

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.940
[Guest]: produce the right people, right?

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:24.540
[Guest]: The worst get on top, true.

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:30.300
[Guest]: But once upon a time, we did have genuine statesmen, activists as they were, right?

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:36.340
[Guest]: Krishna here was an extremely activist judge, wrote horrible judgments, created a lot of

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:41.260
[Guest]: problems in labor law and labor jurisprudence that we have until today.

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:43.700
[Guest]: But none of it was self-serving.

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:48.580
[Amit Varma]: I think, you know, in the public choice column that I write for Bloomberg Quint, I think

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:53.420
[Amit Varma]: the first of those examined the question of, in the context of politics, why we had such

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:58.300
[Amit Varma]: outstanding leaders in the post-immediate, post-independence generation, and we don't

01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.300
[Amit Varma]: today.

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:03.660
[Amit Varma]: And I think the same reason would apply to justices to some extent as well, which is

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:09.020
[Amit Varma]: that it's a residue of a time where the incentives were different for people to get into politics.

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:13.260
[Amit Varma]: If you got into politics or public service in those days, there wasn't so much in it

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:16.820
[Amit Varma]: for you, you were less likely to be driven by the lust for power or money.

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:21.180
[Amit Varma]: I mean, obviously, none of our freedom fighters had access to any of that in any case.

01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:24.820
[Amit Varma]: And you were more likely to be animated by higher principles.

01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:28.940
[Amit Varma]: And I'd say that it's kind of inevitable that given the shoddy rules that we have, that

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:34.260
[Amit Varma]: we will end up over a period of time with a bunch of scoundrels, both in politics and

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:35.500
[Amit Varma]: in the judiciary.

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:40.700
[Guest]: I completely agree with that, that over a period of time, if you have a bad set of rules

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:46.260
[Guest]: that actually don't check people and don't constrain people, then it creates a situation

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:53.060
[Guest]: where you have, you know, that there will be enough, you know, sort of crazy people

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:57.420
[Guest]: in society or self-serving people in society who will try and manipulate those rules to

01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.420
[Guest]: their benefit.

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:03.380
[Guest]: And if the bad rules and systems continue over a period of long time, then there is

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:06.180
[Guest]: no question that eventually that group will take over.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.700
[Guest]: And that's exactly what has happened with the judiciary.

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:13.760
[Guest]: You know, we talk about dynastic politics and nepotism, there is no institution with

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:17.940
[Guest]: greater nepotism than the court system in India.

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:24.260
[Guest]: You know, I mean, we have way more number of father-son, you know, Supreme Court justices

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:29.500
[Guest]: pairs than we have, you know, father-son or brother pairs of chief ministers or prime

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.260
[Guest]: ministers or something like that.

01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:36.620
[Guest]: Now, there is a, one part of it is all of India is dynastic, right, you know, the son

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:41.020
[Guest]: of a potter becomes a potter kind of problem, but there is also a question of nepotism and

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:45.780
[Guest]: connections and, you know, do you know how to navigate the system and hobnob with the

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:48.580
[Guest]: right people such that they nominate you to the bench.

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:53.660
[Guest]: And when the judicial system is completely insular in its appointment systems, this is

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:55.660
[Guest]: just far more likely to happen.

01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:01.340
[Guest]: Also, this is the kind of situation where you get a lot of possibilities of sexual harassment

01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:02.340
[Guest]: and so on.

01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:03.340
[Guest]: Right.

01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.020
[Guest]: Now, think about it.

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:08.060
[Guest]: If the Chief Justice of India, now that's not what happened in the current case.

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:14.380
[Guest]: The current case, the complainant is not a judge, okay, but is a staff member.

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:20.620
[Guest]: But you can very easily imagine, right, if enough women make it to the bench, the day

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:25.980
[Guest]: is not far that if all the appointments are controlled by these five men right on top,

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:27.380
[Guest]: that they can abuse their power.

01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:31.740
[Guest]: Now, we haven't had that problem yet because there are so few women in the system.

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:36.580
[Guest]: You know, I don't know if that's a benefit or a problem, but so far we haven't had that.

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:40.860
[Guest]: But very soon you're going to see those kinds of problems also.

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:46.220
[Guest]: And I think the biggest problem is when the court system does things like this, it is

01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:49.540
[Guest]: legitimacy in the eyes of the public.

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:53.700
[Guest]: Justice must be done, but it must also seem to be done, right?

01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:57.020
[Guest]: In some sense, this is all a bit of a magic trick, right?

01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:00.620
[Guest]: We all believe that magic is happening and then it's happening.

01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:05.900
[Guest]: Now, if we start questioning that this is really not what it seems to be, the whole

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:11.220
[Guest]: institution will come down like a pack of cards because the court doesn't really have

01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:14.660
[Guest]: any power of its own aside from public legitimacy.

01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:18.460
[Guest]: It doesn't control the purse strings and it doesn't control the sword, right?

01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:24.700
[Guest]: So the court system only survives if the people who are vested in the court system think that

01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:26.820
[Guest]: it has a right to exist.

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:31.100
[Guest]: So if there are more situations like this, which is basically a problem propagated by

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:38.300
[Guest]: the appointment system, but if there are more situations like Chief Justice Mishra who sat

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:44.820
[Guest]: in his own cause and same as this current Chief Justice Gogoi who sat in a matter in

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:48.780
[Guest]: his own cause, very soon that legitimacy will be lost.

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:52.520
[Guest]: So that's a problem and it can't be fixed overnight.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:56.780
[Guest]: You can get rid of a bad judge overnight, but this public legitimacy, it just can't

01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:57.780
[Amit Varma]: be fixed overnight.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:02.060
[Amit Varma]: This whole situation of, you know, a judge sitting in a case where he is the accused

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:06.620
[Amit Varma]: feels to me like, you know, the batting side in a cricket match also being the umpire.

01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:11.420
[Amit Varma]: So the captain of the batting side will decide whether somebody is out LBW or not.

01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:12.420
[Amit Varma]: It's ludicrous.

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:13.420
[Amit Varma]: And I had an episode.

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:17.580
[Guest]: Can I, can I give you, interrupt and give you an example of that?

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:18.580
[Guest]: Sure.

01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:24.020
[Guest]: When we were kids playing cricket, the person who owned the bat decided whether that person

01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:25.020
[Guest]: was out or not.

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:27.500
[Guest]: I don't know if this was your experience.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:32.980
[Guest]: But the kid who owned the bat never got out because we all had to wait our turn to bat

01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:34.580
[Guest]: because we didn't have one.

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:36.100
[Guest]: So it's a little bit like that also.

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.220
[Guest]: You see a lot of that happening in India.

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:39.220
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:42.940
[Amit Varma]: And I had an episode a year back on judicial reforms with my friend Alok Prasanna Kumar.

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:46.220
[Amit Varma]: And you know, he made a very similar point to what you're making now, where he spoke

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.820
[Amit Varma]: about how our Supreme Court has a diversity problem.

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:55.460
[Amit Varma]: And in my mind, the ramification of this is not just in terms of representation and so

01:17:55.460 --> 01:18:00.420
[Amit Varma]: on in a democracy, but also it impacts decision making, like one of the best books I've read

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:05.100
[Amit Varma]: in the last few years is a book by Philip Tetlock called Super Forecasting, which refers

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:13.340
[Amit Varma]: to a study which showed that the most important parameter for good decision making is diversity.

01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:17.180
[Amit Varma]: It's not intelligence, it's not knowledge, it's not or any of those things, but diversity.

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:22.140
[Amit Varma]: And the more diverse that a group is, the more likely you are to make good decisions.

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:25.580
[Amit Varma]: For example, you spoke about the judicial activism of the Delhi High Court earlier,

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:29.140
[Amit Varma]: where they spoke about, you know, all the buses have to go CNG.

01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:32.460
[Amit Varma]: And you imagine that if the court was diverse enough that there are people who've actually

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:39.860
[Amit Varma]: grown up riding around in buses and auto rickshaws, maybe they might have had greater foresight

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:42.980
[Amit Varma]: in that situation and not done what they did.

01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:48.580
[Amit Varma]: But that aside, so you know, what I see here is a worst of both possible worlds.

01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:53.580
[Amit Varma]: On the one hand, the judiciary is not quite independent from the executive because of

01:18:53.580 --> 01:19:00.420
[Amit Varma]: bad incentives in play, such as post retirement options, where the government can always hold

01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:06.060
[Amit Varma]: out carrots in front of judges and say that, okay, after you retire, this is what you get

01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:08.820
[Amit Varma]: and you get that car with the red button on top.

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:15.060
[Amit Varma]: And on the other hand, it is also too powerful in and of itself because it controls the appointment

01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:19.940
[Amit Varma]: process through the collegium, the second judge's case of 1993, as you pointed out,

01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:25.580
[Amit Varma]: a case of judicial activism, which was actually self-serving.

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:27.780
[Amit Varma]: So this is like a double problem now.

01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:28.780
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:29.780
[Guest]: How do we solve this?

01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:31.020
[Guest]: It's very difficult to solve it.

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:37.780
[Guest]: So you know, in, you know, all credit to the Modi government, they tried, okay, they passed

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:41.620
[Guest]: a constitutional amendment, which was called the NJAC, you know, the National Judicial

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:42.620
[Guest]: Collegium.

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:49.420
[Guest]: They amended article 124 to 17, and basically they changed the appointment procedure in

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.300
[Guest]: the formal text of the constitution.

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:54.140
[Guest]: So it was a full constitutional amendment, right?

01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:58.220
[Guest]: And this constitutional amendment basically said that the collegium will not just have

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:00.140
[Guest]: members of the judiciary.

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:05.660
[Guest]: So the collegium will be the chief justice of India and two justices, but it will also

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:07.460
[Guest]: represent the law minister.

01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:12.460
[Guest]: So one position out of six will go to the executive, three positions out of six will

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:13.460
[Guest]: be the judiciary.

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:16.380
[Guest]: That is the CJI and the next two senior most justices.

01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:22.020
[Guest]: And it had a provision that there will be two eminent persons who will be on this collegium,

01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.020
[Guest]: right?

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:29.500
[Guest]: And I think the idea behind this was, look, there is a problem with the executive having

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:35.380
[Guest]: a 50% stake because, you know, the government of India, both the union and the state governments

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:39.140
[Guest]: is the largest litigant before the court, right?

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:43.060
[Guest]: So in that sense, it's a problem to have too much representation.

01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:46.100
[Guest]: So they kept it down to one person, right?

01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:51.180
[Guest]: And they had this for, you know, two eminent people from society sort of provision.

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:54.580
[Guest]: And there was also provision that there should be enough women and minorities, right?

01:20:54.580 --> 01:21:00.500
[Guest]: Within the group that chooses these eminent persons and three from the judiciary.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:05.460
[Guest]: Now, it is not the best system according to me, but I think it would have still been an

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:09.240
[Guest]: improvement over the current system, right?

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:12.940
[Guest]: Because there was a genuine recognition that the executive needs to participate, but not

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:14.980
[Guest]: participate too much.

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:20.260
[Guest]: And the Supreme Court struck this constitutional amendment down saying it violates the basic

01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:23.420
[Guest]: structure and went back to the system of the collegium.

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:24.420
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:29.740
[Amit Varma]: So you can't actually, so they get to rule on anything which affects them using the excuse

01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:30.740
[Guest]: of the basic structure.

01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:32.940
[Guest]: Yeah, using the basic structure.

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:33.940
[Guest]: So this is a problem.

01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:36.900
[Guest]: And then what happened was, I mean, the executive is also clever.

01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:41.420
[Guest]: So the cabinet didn't appoint judges for a long time.

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:46.300
[Guest]: You know, I think this last week we are finally operating at a full strength of the bench,

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:47.300
[Guest]: right?

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:51.040
[Guest]: So the chief justice would send names and the cabinet just won't appoint them.

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.040
[Guest]: So what can you do?

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.040
[Guest]: Right?

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:56.360
[Guest]: So they were in deadlock, which basically meant justice suffered because the bench is

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:58.940
[Guest]: not operating at its full strength, right?

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:03.020
[Guest]: So the cabinet was very clever in that they didn't do anything overt.

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.500
[Guest]: But they also knew when to dig their heels.

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:09.620
[Guest]: So now it is a more collaborative process, but there are some other very big problems

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:10.860
[Guest]: with this, right?

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:15.040
[Guest]: Now let's say they wanted to be completely insular.

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:18.660
[Guest]: That is, it was the chief justice of India plus four justices.

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:22.940
[Guest]: It would be so much better still if they made the procedure transparent.

01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:27.940
[Guest]: That is, if the collegium sat and they actually took down minutes to the meeting.

01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:32.900
[Guest]: In every meeting they told you how many of the members of these five, you know, members

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:36.980
[Guest]: of the collegium support every appointment or oppose every appointment.

01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:39.100
[Guest]: None of this exists.

01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:43.340
[Guest]: You know, since the second judge's case, and you know, it's confirmation in the third judge's

01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:47.420
[Guest]: case, we don't have any minutes to collegium meetings.

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:48.420
[Guest]: They don't exist.

01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:49.420
[Guest]: Right?

01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:54.820
[Guest]: And if they did exist, which institution has the authority to subpoena them?

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:55.820
[Guest]: No one.

01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:58.420
[Guest]: So how can we demand to see these minutes?

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:04.260
[Guest]: So the procedures that came about in the third judge's case, which the Supreme Court had

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:08.300
[Guest]: enforced, they are not being followed by the Supreme Court.

01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:11.940
[Guest]: So the Supreme Court is sort of running its own like gundaraj kind of thing, right?

01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:13.940
[Guest]: It does whatever it wants.

01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:19.740
[Guest]: Justice Chellameshwar actually came forward and said that I am in the collegium, but it

01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:24.340
[Guest]: is not recording meetings and it's not recording dissent, right?

01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:27.780
[Guest]: If you remember last year, there was that famous press conference by the four senior

01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:32.820
[Guest]: most judges against Chief Justice Deepak Mishra about the master of the roster and all of

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:33.820
[Guest]: those things.

01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:36.260
[Guest]: And one of those issues was also the collegium.

01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:44.300
[Guest]: So there is a really big problem in that the courts think that any requirement of disclosure

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:48.060
[Guest]: or scrutiny is a threat to their independence, which is simply not true.

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:53.260
[Guest]: I mean, this is just really, it's sort of like, you know, in the Soviet, the Duma, there

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:59.780
[Guest]: was one of the protections was that there can't be any criminal charges against members

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:00.780
[Guest]: of the Duma.

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:02.500
[Guest]: So guess what happened?

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.580
[Guest]: All the criminals ended up in the Duma, right?

01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:09.780
[Guest]: So it's one of those sort of things where if you create a system where you are completely

01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:14.260
[Guest]: above scrutiny, then only those people who really wish to be above scrutiny are going

01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:15.940
[Guest]: to lobby for these spots.

01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:20.540
[Guest]: All good decent people are going to sort of stay away from the system because if you're

01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:25.420
[Guest]: not a politically motivated judge, you won't survive in this current judicial jungle of

01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:26.860
[Guest]: the collegium.

01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:28.380
[Guest]: So this is sort of the problem.

01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:33.220
[Guest]: There are some other problems also, like the retirement age is frankly too low.

01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:35.380
[Guest]: And particularly with reference to the high court.

01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:37.900
[Guest]: So you know, the high court retirement age is 62.

01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:42.380
[Guest]: So the way it works is mostly Supreme Court justices are promoted up from the high court

01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:46.300
[Guest]: and mostly it is when the high court judges retire.

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:51.860
[Guest]: So the average term of a Supreme Court justice is just around two years.

01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:55.580
[Guest]: And the average term of a chief justice is about six to eight months.

01:24:55.580 --> 01:25:00.380
[Guest]: We've had chief justices who've served three weeks because of the seniority rule.

01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:05.820
[Guest]: So there is a lot of churn at the top, you know, so that is one very, very big problem.

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:10.780
[Guest]: That's a diversity problem also, because if most of your judges are coming up from the

01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:17.180
[Guest]: high court, then you are getting a very sort of like monochromatic picture of what the

01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:19.580
[Guest]: judiciary needs to look like.

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:22.860
[Guest]: Everyone looks the same and has the same kind of experience.

01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:29.820
[Guest]: Now, if you read books about the judiciary originally by George Gadboy, you know, who's

01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:34.340
[Guest]: done profiles of all the judges, you will notice that even initially both the high court

01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:41.020
[Guest]: and the Supreme Court were mostly men, upper caste Brahmin men who had some legal training

01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:45.500
[Guest]: and had family, which was like a family of lawyers, right?

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:52.300
[Guest]: So there wasn't too much diversity when we began either, but it seems to have gotten

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:53.300
[Guest]: worse.

01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:56.660
[Guest]: There was a little more diversity of thought because they came from different high courts

01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:04.380
[Guest]: and different backgrounds personally, but now it's all very elite, upper caste, privileged

01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:08.700
[Guest]: people whose family have excellent legal and political connections who are sort of moving

01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:11.260
[Guest]: up the bench in the court system.

01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:16.900
[Guest]: And there is a really big problem of minority representation in terms of other religions,

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:19.500
[Guest]: women, Dalit community.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.020
[Guest]: It's a really big problem right now, right?

01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:27.860
[Guest]: So it's both diversity of individuals in terms of identity and also diversity of ideas.

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:31.980
[Guest]: Like you said, you know, if you've never ridden in a bus, you don't know the problems of shutting

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:33.560
[Guest]: down a bus service.

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.740
[Guest]: So it's a little bit of both.

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:39.300
[Guest]: And the Supreme Court is now completely captured by this mess.

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:43.180
[Guest]: And it's not easy in terms of what is the way out of this.

01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:49.340
[Guest]: I mean, the new Modi government could have some renewed pressure.

01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:56.460
[Guest]: You know, I mean, this new term has got such a loud and large mandate in favor of Narendra

01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:03.220
[Guest]: Modi and given the complete mess that has been made by the Supreme Court in the last

01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:09.060
[Guest]: year and a half, it is possible that if another constitutional amendment is pushed forth with

01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:14.820
[Guest]: a sensible set of appointment rules and procedures, it is possible that the public will support

01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:19.220
[Guest]: the government and not the Supreme Court for the first time in a very long time.

01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:20.900
[Guest]: So there are some possibilities.

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:21.900
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:26.860
[Amit Varma]: So I should point out to my listeners that we're actually recording this on May 23rd,

01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:29.540
[Amit Varma]: which is the date of the election results.

01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:30.780
[Amit Varma]: They've just been announced today morning.

01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:34.620
[Amit Varma]: We're recording this in the evening, which is why we are not talking about the executive

01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:38.380
[Amit Varma]: or the legislature, but about the Supreme Court, silly.

01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:44.060
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that in all of this, there is a sort of this fundamental trade off that

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:48.780
[Amit Varma]: has to be made between on the one hand, the independence of the judiciary, which is important,

01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:55.220
[Amit Varma]: but on the other hand, between the accountability of the judiciary, which also matters a great

01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:56.220
[Amit Varma]: deal.

01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:57.220
[Guest]: Now, I want to ask you.

01:27:57.220 --> 01:28:02.940
[Guest]: And thirdly, the competence, frankly, I mean, I mean, if you read the more recent judgments

01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:06.180
[Guest]: and opinions, they are just a horror.

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:10.620
[Guest]: I mean, and when I say a horror, I'm not being a snob like, oh, you know, it's grammatically

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:11.940
[Guest]: incorrect or not formatted.

01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:19.180
[Guest]: I really mean, in terms of points of fact and points of law, these judges seem to have

01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:24.540
[Guest]: just come out of nowhere, and they seem to just write whatever flies into their mind.

01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:28.020
[Guest]: And there is no sensible reasoning.

01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:31.320
[Guest]: Reason has left the Supreme Court building completely.

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:34.260
[Guest]: So that is, I think, the greatest loss in all of this.

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:40.140
[Guest]: We are having a huge body of law, but that law has no reason in it.

01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:46.460
[Guest]: So it is not very useful in terms of being binding as, you know, precedent in the future,

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:52.140
[Guest]: because we don't have any sensible, like, doctrinal analysis on why is it that the courts

01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:56.940
[Guest]: have come to this opinion or, you know, landed on one side or the other side in this particular

01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:57.940
[Guest]: case.

01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:03.860
[Guest]: So it's, what is being lost is more than just, oh, I don't like this Supreme Court judge

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:06.860
[Guest]: and there's a sexual harassment against that Supreme Court justice.

01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:08.900
[Guest]: That's really not the only thing at stake.

01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:15.820
[Guest]: There is a huge missed opportunity on what is a sensible body of law and rules.

01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:19.340
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of quick questions before we wind it up.

01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:24.020
[Amit Varma]: Number one, from within the judiciary, there have been voices of dissent and change, including

01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:25.980
[Amit Varma]: from the Supreme Court itself.

01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:30.140
[Amit Varma]: What is driving those voices and how likely are they to succeed?

01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:36.100
[Amit Varma]: And number two, you spoke about the NJAC constitutional amendment that the last Modi government tried

01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:39.300
[Amit Varma]: and you pointed out about how it would be a good measure.

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:43.500
[Amit Varma]: What was driving the attempt by the government to sort of get that amendment through?

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.220
[Amit Varma]: What are their incentives?

01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:53.420
[Guest]: So, you know, I would say, you know, despite my other reservations with a lot of Modi government's

01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:59.620
[Guest]: policies on the NJAC matter, they were fairly restrained.

01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:02.180
[Guest]: You know, I must give credit where credit is due.

01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:06.740
[Guest]: And this is obviously in comparison to the horrors of Indira Gandhi and the emergency,

01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:07.740
[Guest]: right?

01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:12.700
[Guest]: So they could have done a lot worse given the kind of popularity and mandate they had,

01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:14.060
[Guest]: but they were fairly restrained.

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:15.700
[Guest]: They tried to do it properly.

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:21.660
[Guest]: They tried to do it through a proper constitutional amendment procedure and the amendment had

01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:25.820
[Guest]: a lot of problems, but it wasn't the worst thing that had been suggested and it was probably

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.860
[Guest]: an improvement over the past.

01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:31.540
[Guest]: So that is the first thing I want to say about that.

01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:38.220
[Guest]: The second is, I think the revolution has to come from within if it has to have legitimacy.

01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:42.580
[Guest]: So you know, I wrote a column a few months ago saying the Supreme Court needs to have

01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:44.460
[Guest]: a Ulysses fact.

01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:47.780
[Guest]: So you know the story of Ulysses and the sirens?

01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:54.940
[Amit Varma]: You remind my listeners, which is one way of saying, I know, but remind my listeners.

01:30:54.940 --> 01:31:04.500
[Guest]: So Ulysses or, you know, the Odyssey, so him, when he returns from the wars and travels

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:11.380
[Guest]: and he's on the ship with all his men, he realizes that he is going to get distracted

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:15.860
[Guest]: by the sound or the music of the sirens, right?

01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:18.300
[Guest]: And what Ulysses does is quite interesting.

01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:23.900
[Guest]: He pours wax into the ears of all his men so that they are not distracted by the sound

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:25.380
[Guest]: of the sirens.

01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:33.060
[Guest]: And then he ties himself to the mast of the ship and tells his men not to untie him, right?

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:37.260
[Guest]: So this is basically like the legend or the mythical version.

01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:43.180
[Guest]: The idea is that you must tie your own hands because you know that your future self, when

01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:47.080
[Guest]: faced with the terrible incentives, will not be able to do the right thing.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:52.100
[Guest]: But your current self already knows that, so you must take precautions for it, right?

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:57.940
[Guest]: So if Ulysses has no one else to monitor and govern him the way he could monitor his men

01:31:57.940 --> 01:32:02.940
[Guest]: and pour wax in his ears, then it is upon Ulysses to tie himself to the mast.

01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:04.300
[Guest]: That's sort of the idea.

01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:10.100
[Guest]: So this legend or folklore was, you know, invoked by John Elster when he spoke about

01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:11.700
[Guest]: constitutional constraints.

01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:13.360
[Guest]: So that's where this comes from.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:18.300
[Guest]: So I had written a column that said that the Indian Supreme Court needs its own Ulysses

01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:25.940
[Guest]: Pact, which is they need to come up with a system of internal rules and protocols on

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:29.940
[Guest]: appointment, on retirement age, and they need to stick by it, right?

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:32.740
[Guest]: Now these are experts in lawmaking, right?

01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:36.660
[Guest]: So they need to create a culture where they come up with a very clear set of rules on

01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:40.500
[Guest]: appointment and they have disclosure requirements, right?

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.100
[Guest]: So that's one way.

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:46.860
[Guest]: Another is they need to have protocols for recusal, which is if you are adjudicating

01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:51.460
[Guest]: your own case or it's come before your bench, when must you recuse yourself and when can

01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:53.500
[Guest]: you continue, right?

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:57.100
[Guest]: That's another kind of situation that needs protocols.

01:32:57.100 --> 01:33:04.000
[Guest]: Then a third situation that needs protocols is, should there be some kind of like moratorium

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.820
[Guest]: or a gap before you're allowed to take other paid work or, you know, work for the government

01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:10.820
[Guest]: of India?

01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:15.340
[Guest]: You know, you also don't want them working for Adani immediately after they sat on a

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:20.240
[Guest]: bench which has a judgment affecting the Adani companies or something like that.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:23.220
[Guest]: So we need to have rules and protocols for all this.

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:25.580
[Guest]: And there are two parts to the rules and protocols.

01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:27.580
[Guest]: One is they need to be put down.

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:34.100
[Guest]: And the second is we do need some leadership within the judiciary to actually enforce this

01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:38.800
[Guest]: over a period of a few years such that they become conventions, right?

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.220
[Guest]: Because it's very difficult.

01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:45.580
[Guest]: I mean, we've tried the bazooka, which is the constitutional amendment, and it has failed.

01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:47.660
[Guest]: And the public was with the judiciary at that time.

01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:54.260
[Guest]: So the judiciary needs to save itself because if they won't let any sunlight from outside,

01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:55.720
[Guest]: they need to come up with a set of rules.

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:58.940
[Guest]: So that is, I think the number one thing that is required.

01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:03.840
[Guest]: The second possibility is we burn the whole thing down and build it up from scratch, which

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.540
[Guest]: could be done with a strong leader like Narendra Modi, frankly.

01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:13.580
[Guest]: You know, he has such huge public support and mandate that if he said that the Supreme

01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:18.380
[Guest]: Court is extremely corrupt, which it is, and there's too much nepotism and dynastic whatever

01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:22.820
[Guest]: in the Supreme Court, and we need to create a new system by which judges are appointed

01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:28.180
[Guest]: and promoted, it is wholly possible that he might get away with it, right?

01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:32.500
[Guest]: So once again, Narendra Modi will also need a Ulysses pact, like he should not go too

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.980
[Guest]: crazy with the power and the mandate that he has.

01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:39.820
[Amit Varma]: I'm already, I'm already shivering in terror, thinking of Mr. Modi changing the constitution

01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:42.820
[Amit Varma]: and putting a new Supreme Court in place and all of that.

01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:47.420
[Guest]: And yeah, well, it won't be a new Supreme Court in place, but it would be a new set

01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:52.540
[Guest]: of procedures to appoint, which frankly needs to come at some point.

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:58.540
[Guest]: You know, I mean, it's a little hard and, you know, in all fairness, he's one fair and

01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:05.500
[Guest]: square with a huge vote share, with a huge majority, a larger majority than before, despite

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:08.220
[Guest]: all his policy failures and successes.

01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:13.740
[Guest]: So if you truly believe in the constitution and democratic decision making, it is very

01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:19.300
[Guest]: complicated to say that I don't like this guy and therefore he shouldn't get involved

01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:21.540
[Guest]: in a constitutional amendment or something like that.

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:27.060
[Guest]: The only person who has the power to dictate a constitutional amendment is the prime minister

01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:31.620
[Guest]: with the support of parliament, obviously, you know, but it needs to come from the majority

01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:32.620
[Amit Varma]: in parliament.

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:33.620
[Amit Varma]: No, I agree with that.

01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:37.220
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, all our prime ministers, Nehru onwards, as you've pointed out repeatedly

01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:42.060
[Amit Varma]: have changed the constitution many, many times, and this man has a majority bigger than most

01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:43.060
[Amit Varma]: others.

01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:47.860
[Amit Varma]: But then I would simply worry about the incentives in play if the executive is to try and redesign

01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:53.220
[Amit Varma]: the judicial system, because obviously they would try to redesign it in such a way that

01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:55.380
[Amit Varma]: the institution loses its independence.

01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:59.620
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they might be, you know, Mr. Modi might be an enlightened statesman and might

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:00.620
[Amit Varma]: not do that.

01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:03.980
[Amit Varma]: But I'm just looking at the incentives and saying, those are the incentives.

01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:08.380
[Guest]: Yeah, but on the other hand, the incentives are pretty bad for the judiciary also to reform

01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:09.380
[Guest]: itself.

01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:12.380
[Guest]: You know, so we're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place sort of, you know, it's

01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:13.380
[Guest]: really difficult.

01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:20.580
[Guest]: And, you know, these are the sorts of areas where a great leader can really break through,

01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:24.060
[Guest]: you know, there's an incentive problem on both sides, there's an incentive problem on

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:29.740
[Guest]: all sides, and it does take a great leader to rise above the incentive problem.

01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:34.540
[Guest]: So, you know, it's possible that it could come from like the next chief justice of India

01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:38.540
[Guest]: or the one after, but it's also possible that it comes from Narendra Modi who wants to make

01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:41.220
[Amit Varma]: a place for himself in history, you know.

01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:42.220
[Amit Varma]: That's fair enough.

01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:43.820
[Amit Varma]: And the chief justices change fairly fast, right?

01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:47.820
[Unknown]: So it's as they change very quickly, there is a chance that there'll be some guy who'll

01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:52.300
[Amit Varma]: say, hey, let me, let me seal my legacy by doing this thing, which I know is kind of

01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:53.300
[Guest]: required.

01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:56.660
[Guest]: But the trouble, you know, we kind of need someone who's around for three, four years.

01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:01.060
[Guest]: I'll tell you why we need someone to put the rules in place and enforce them and create

01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:04.820
[Guest]: a culture over 50-60 judges journey.

01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:06.500
[Guest]: You know, that's when it really takes.

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:12.340
[Guest]: So I think Justice Chandrachud is the next one in line, not immediately, but is the next

01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:15.060
[Guest]: one who will have a fairly long term.

01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:18.100
[Guest]: So my hope is that maybe, you know, his term is long enough.

01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:21.680
[Guest]: You know, this is your classic residual clemency problem, right?

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:26.300
[Guest]: So initially when we used to talk about courts, we used to say the Kanya court, the Shastri

01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:28.900
[Guest]: court, right, the Bhagwati court.

01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:33.140
[Guest]: So the chief justice who was leading the court was sort of responsible for what happened

01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:36.940
[Guest]: during that time in terms of its jurisprudence and procedure.

01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:42.700
[Guest]: So we have no one to take ownership of the court because the churn is just so high.

01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:47.260
[Guest]: So I think one way of thinking about the incentive problem is like you said, you know, someone

01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:54.380
[Guest]: just like Justice Sikri on his last day of retirement just gives you the crazy nuclear

01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:58.900
[Guest]: judgment of Keshavanand Bharti and flies off into the sunset, right?

01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:03.400
[Guest]: The other possibility is someone says, I'm here for five years, my reputation depends

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:09.820
[Guest]: on it, and I have a chance to really reform and put down some rules and actually enforce

01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:12.580
[Guest]: the rules and turn them into convention.

01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:14.860
[Guest]: So I think both are possible.

01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:18.380
[Guest]: The question is, what will happen and who will do it?

01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:22.340
[Amit Varma]: If Justice Chandrachud is listening to this episode, kindly do something about us.

01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:23.340
[Amit Varma]: Get us out of the spot.

01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:26.580
