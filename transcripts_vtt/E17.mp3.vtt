00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920
[Amit Varma]: I had a bad dream the other night.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.720
[Amit Varma]: I dreamed I was naked.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.120
[Amit Varma]: Now being naked in public is a common dream people have and some might even find it pleasurable.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.600
[Amit Varma]: But I wasn't in public.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.080
[Amit Varma]: I was in a bathroom somewhere as the white marble tiles below me made obvious and I wasn't

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.080
[Amit Varma]: alone.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.200
[Amit Varma]: Alongside me, I suddenly realized, were two other men in a similar state of undress.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.800
[Amit Varma]: One was tall and lanky, the other was kind of stocky.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.200
[Amit Varma]: I suddenly recognized them, Amitabh Bachchan and Amit Shah, the other two really famous

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.600
[Amit Varma]: Amits in this country.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:52.040
[Amit Varma]: Mr. Bachchan was singing, Rang barse bheegey chunaru wali rang barse, while Mr. Shah was

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.800
[Amit Varma]: looking at me rather grimly, as if it was written on my forehead that I haven't got

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.400
[Amit Varma]: an Aadhaar card yet.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.200
[Amit Varma]: Suddenly we became wet, a blast of water came at us from the left side of the bathroom and

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.160
[Amit Varma]: as I turned, I saw that there stood Narendra Modi, fully dressed, in a pinstripe suit with

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.600
[Amit Varma]: my name on it, holding a gigantic garden hose and he was spraying us with water.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.760
[Amit Varma]: Modi ji, I said alarmed, what are you doing?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.200
[Amit Varma]: Oh, hello Amit, he said, and Amit, and Amit, I am bathing you guys, I am personally setting

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.360
[Amit Varma]: an example under my new government scheme, the Swachh Amit Abhiyan, all Amits in India

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.440
[Amit Varma]: must be cleaned, you should see the cess I am charging for it, muha ha ha ha.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.360
[Amit Varma]: The Swachh Amit Abhiyan, I asked, what's that?

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.320
[Amit Varma]: It's a centrally sponsored government scheme, the Swachh Amit Abhiyan and after your bath,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.760
[Amit Varma]: you will go to school under another centrally sponsored government scheme, the Varma Shiksha

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:04.880
[Amit Varma]: Yojana, where you will be taught to behave yourself, muha ha ha ha, muha ha ha ha.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.280
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.280
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.720
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Varma.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.480
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen, I am your host, Amit Varma.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.440
[Amit Varma]: As you may have understood from the bad dream I just told you about, I really don't like

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.000
[Amit Varma]: centrally sponsored government schemes, but why?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.980
[Amit Varma]: To discuss the unseen effects of such schemes, I have with me in the studio, Pranay Kotasthane,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.600
[Amit Varma]: my colleague in the magazine Pragati and a fellow at the Takshashila Institution, Pranay,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600
[Guest]: welcome to the show.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.120
[Amit Varma]: Thanks Amit, good to be here again.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.880
[Amit Varma]: Raj Bharat Abhiyan, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sarak Yojana, these sound

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.000
[Amit Varma]: like such incredible schemes with golden intentions at their heart.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.360
[Amit Varma]: But you have an issue with centrally sponsored government schemes like all three of these

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.360
[Amit Varma]: and many others.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.960
[Amit Varma]: Can you first tell me and my listeners, what are centrally sponsored government schemes?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.200
[Guest]: Good note to start with Amit, good intentions never make good policy or that's not the sufficient

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.680
[Guest]: condition anyways.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.080
[Guest]: So yeah, let's go back to what these schemes are.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.920
[Guest]: So essentially, in the Indian federal system, you have governments at three levels.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.640
[Guest]: And at each of these three levels, governments spend money on various services.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.400
[Guest]: And each of these three levels also earn some money.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.400
[Guest]: So by these three levels, you mean center state, center state and the local governments,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.400
[Guest]: right?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.000
[Guest]: So now, as it happens, the amount that these governments spend is always more than the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.200
[Guest]: amount that they earn.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.320
[Guest]: And because governments are not households or companies, they can still survive, even

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.680
[Guest]: though they run deficits.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.840
[Guest]: So what do they do to make up for this deficit?

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.320
[Guest]: One they take debts.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.240
[Guest]: So you have foreign debts, you also have debts from one government to the other.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.140
[Guest]: And the other way that governments engage is by supporting some other level of government.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.200
[Guest]: So how that happens in India is, so now we have the state government, state government

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.120
[Guest]: will get some money, which is something like a cash transfer, which is in public finance

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.880
[Amit Varma]: literature, it is called general purpose from the central government from the union government.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.040
[Guest]: So that is just like I am giving you cash, you can do whatever you want to do with it.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.200
[Guest]: So now, this type of thing is formulaic based.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.080
[Guest]: So it is determined by something called as a finance commission, and it just comes to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.080
[Guest]: the state government.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.480
[Guest]: Now, the objective of such transfer is basically you want to have comparable levels of public

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.240
[Guest]: services at comparable tax rates across across the country.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.280
[Guest]: So this is sort of that cash component of the money which is given.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.040
[Guest]: The other part and that is what the topic of today's discussion is something which is

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.640
[Guest]: called discretionary transfers.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.980
[Guest]: Now these transfers or these, this money is meant for specific areas.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.280
[Guest]: So this money is not meant for you, it's not a cash transfer, think of it as a voucher.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.200
[Guest]: So the central government gives these vouchers to the state governments to be used on things

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.000
[Guest]: like swachhata or things like education or roads or something like that.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.400
[Guest]: So that is what is called a centrally sponsored scheme.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.480
[Guest]: So again, from public finance literature, the objective of such a type of transfer is

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.560
[Guest]: to ensure minimum standards of services in these particular areas are met.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.880
[Guest]: So that is the idea why union government would want to give this specific vouchers on these

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.880
[Guest]: schemes.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.840
[Amit Varma]: So that is about centrally sponsored schemes.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.640
[Amit Varma]: And states therefore have no option but to use the amount allocated for say Swachh Bharat

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.320
[Amit Varma]: on Swachh Bharat initiatives, they can't decide that hey, locally these issues are more important

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.120
[Amit Varma]: and therefore we will spend on these instead.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.800
[Guest]: Yes, that's the whole problem.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.480
[Guest]: So this the problem with centrally sponsored schemes is these are designed at the union

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.840
[Guest]: government level.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.840
[Guest]: These are funded by the union government, but the implementation is left to the states.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.960
[Guest]: So now is maybe the states might say, for example, Kerala might say that primary education

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.120
[Guest]: is no longer important for me because I have already hit 99% literacy rate, probably I

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.360
[Guest]: want to use the money that you're giving for something else.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.840
[Guest]: But because you are forcing and you have this big scheme called Sarva Shaksha Abhiyan, there

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.200
[Guest]: are enough political economy interests in Kerala, which will say, yeah, let this go

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.960
[Guest]: on and we'll keep putting some money in primary education as well, though even it might not

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.600
[Amit Varma]: be my focus anymore.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.840
[Amit Varma]: India set up as a sort of a federal state where you have different states with the independent

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.520
[Amit Varma]: budgets and they compete with each other for labor, for investment and so on and so forth.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.760
[Amit Varma]: And that's the intention.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.600
[Amit Varma]: But over the years, that's, of course, been subverted and the central directs more and

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.080
[Amit Varma]: more top down, especially back in the good old days of the planning commission.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.480
[Amit Varma]: Now with the Modi government, everyone thought that, okay, he's going to focus more on federalism,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.960
[Amit Varma]: but the centrally sponsored schemes have just gone up.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.800
[Amit Varma]: Why do centrally sponsored schemes keep increasing in number?

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.120
[Guest]: Yeah, that's a good question.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:58.400
[Guest]: So basically, this very much comes from this idea of a planned economy and that someone

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.000
[Guest]: can direct from Delhi that how should India be governed.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.040
[Guest]: So one main reason why these schemes have taken place is because every PM wants to give

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:14.200
[Guest]: a stellar speech on 15th August from the ramparts of the Red Fort, announcing great new schemes.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.240
[Guest]: What is a speech if it doesn't announce 10 new schemes, right?

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.160
[Guest]: It doesn't make cut, it's not very popular.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.760
[Guest]: So that's the whole idea why Union governments want to announce a whole host of schemes.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:34.440
[Guest]: Now, earlier in around 1969, etc, when we were in the planned period, still pretty much

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.120
[Guest]: in the planned period, that was the time when the Union government started sort of increasing

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.200
[Guest]: the number of schemes, which are called centrally sponsored schemes.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.000
[Guest]: And consequently, the amount that the Union government can give is depending on how much

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.080
[Guest]: tax it collects, etc, right.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.600
[Guest]: So what they did is, over the years, the Union government said that this cash component that

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.200
[Guest]: we are giving, we'll reduce that because you guys can't do much without it.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.840
[Guest]: Instead, what we'll do is we will tell you how to spend it, we will design the schemes,

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.160
[Guest]: and then you either have to implement them or give some amount of money from your side

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.000
[Guest]: as well to run this scheme.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.340
[Guest]: So this started proliferating, okay.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.160
[Guest]: And apart from centrally sponsored schemes, here is one more jargon, there is something

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.840
[Guest]: called a central sector scheme.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.240
[Guest]: So these are schemes which are run by the Union government itself, states doesn't come

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.200
[Guest]: into picture, like railways, for example, Air India, for example.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.560
[Guest]: So combine these two central sector and centrally sponsored schemes, these sort of started taking

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.380
[Guest]: priority and these started proliferating.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:42.180
[Guest]: And at one point of time, believe me, there were around 960 such schemes, okay.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:48.600
[Guest]: So how can you expect a government at the Union level with as diverse states in India

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:54.600
[Guest]: that we have to run 960 schemes and that too by subverting what many times should have

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.440
[Guest]: been done by the state governments.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.160
[Guest]: So this started increasing.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.440
[Guest]: And like we always have in India, there were lots of commissions and committees set up

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.320
[Guest]: to investigate this.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.960
[Guest]: So there is a Chaturvedi committee, there is a Sarkaria committee, there is Punchi commission,

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.000
[Guest]: all these commissions basically said the same thing, that central government can't do this,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.800
[Guest]: you can't run so many schemes for no reason.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.760
[Guest]: And let the state governments decide what they want to do.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:27.560
[Guest]: What you need to do is there are certain critical, critical areas in which you definitely need

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.560
[Guest]: to ensure minimum standards, which I said, like health, education, these are critical

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.880
[Guest]: areas which have interstate externalities, right, the impact of those are felt across

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.880
[Guest]: India.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.520
[Guest]: So you would want Union government to fund these.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.280
[Guest]: But apart from that, there is no reason why Union government should run a host of other

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.760
[Guest]: central sector schemes like you have Khelo India, and there is Blue Revolution and things

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.760
[Guest]: like that.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.760
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely no reason why Union government should run.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.880
[Amit Varma]: I've never heard of the Blue Revolution.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.880
[Guest]: What is that?

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.880
[Guest]: Blue Revolution is for fisheries.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.880
[Guest]: Okay.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we often use the term Maybap government for how the government relates to its people.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.560
[Amit Varma]: But now we see that there's a level of Maybapness internally also within government.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.060
[Amit Varma]: Central government is telling state governments, I'm your Maybap boys.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.120
[Amit Varma]: This is your pocket money, but you got to do with it what I say.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.440
[Amit Varma]: So you'd say that the unseen effects essentially are that the states are not able to allocate

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.840
[Amit Varma]: these resources efficiently, because the central government which has much less local information

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.960
[Amit Varma]: and incentives, wrong, you know, unaligned incentives are determining what they do with

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.960
[Guest]: the money.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.720
[Guest]: Yeah, that's true.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.480
[Guest]: Before going to the unseen effect, just one point I wanted to make is that the number

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:45.680
[Guest]: of schemes at least notionally are have decreased after all these commissions made their recommendation.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.680
[Guest]: So two, three years back, we had 147 of them, then it came down to 66.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:57.160
[Guest]: And currently the centrally sponsored schemes, not the central sector schemes are 30 in number.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.280
[Guest]: Now how did they go about reducing this?

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.400
[Guest]: It was not that the Union government went out of these areas.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.360
[Guest]: What they just did is they clubbed two or three schemes, gave a new name, and they said

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.720
[Guest]: this is one mega scheme.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:14.120
[Guest]: So that rationalization was just a hogwash and what they just did is renaming.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.500
[Guest]: So now we are at the current level, we have 30 schemes.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.120
[Guest]: Now I still feel even 30 is a lot more and because the critical areas that we discussed

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.400
[Guest]: are not 30, they can do a lot lesser.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.280
[Guest]: Now coming back to the unseen effects.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.600
[Guest]: Yes, the first point is the requirements across states are very, very diverse.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:38.320
[Guest]: So what Bihar needs is very different from what Tamil Nadu need or what Punjab needs.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.980
[Guest]: So how is it that the Union government will be in a better position to determine what

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.080
[Guest]: is good for that particular state?

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.200
[Guest]: Isn't it better that the state governments decide what they should do?

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.200
[Guest]: I would argue not even state level, probably the local governments are the best ones to

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.200
[Guest]: determine.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.880
[Guest]: We have some distance to go till we reach there.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.560
[Guest]: So let's just say that at least state governments are in a much better position than the Union

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:08.560
[Guest]: government and hence you should do more cash transfers to the state governments and let

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.440
[Guest]: them determine what their priorities are.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.680
[Guest]: That is one thing.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:18.600
[Guest]: Another thing is a very fundamental question of the constitutionalism.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.080
[Guest]: Now many of these schemes which we have been talking over the years actually fall in something

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.920
[Guest]: called the state list and the concurrent list in the constitution.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.800
[Guest]: By these two lists, I mean state list explains what should be the areas in which state governments

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.960
[Guest]: have priority or state governments can act there.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.360
[Guest]: Concurrent list is where both Union and state governments can act.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.520
[Guest]: Now ideally you would say Union government can do a lot more in the Union list schemes

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.840
[Guest]: like defense, right, that's in the purview of the Union government.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:55.000
[Guest]: But over the years, all these centrally sponsored schemes, for example, health, right, health

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.880
[Guest]: comes under a concurrent list, some parts here.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:04.840
[Guest]: And that is still done by, there is a Rashtriya Swasthya Mission which is trying to do things

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.840
[Guest]: on health.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.200
[Guest]: Education is in the purview of the state list.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.160
[Guest]: But again there is a big centrally sponsored scheme there.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:18.400
[Guest]: So the unseen effect of all this has been that all the areas which the state government

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.680
[Guest]: should have, which even the constitution determined that state governments are better place to

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.040
[Guest]: do, are being clearly subverted.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.320
[Guest]: And there is no debate on that at all.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.960
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense the constitution itself is being subverted and therefore the intentions behind

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.320
[Amit Varma]: those specific parts of the constitution have just been thrown out of the window.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.320
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.600
[Guest]: So the writ of the constitution is sort of getting subverted because of this.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.980
[Guest]: And this has happened over the last 30-40 years.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.800
[Guest]: So that is the problem.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.360
[Guest]: And one big change that has happened last year and that is why this topic is of interest

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.340
[Guest]: is with what the 14th Finance Commission did.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.060
[Guest]: What it actually did is, it increased that cash component to the states.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.660
[Guest]: So now state governments technically have more money at their hands.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:08.240
[Guest]: So now this is the right time where you can make this argument that central government

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:14.440
[Guest]: should just get out of some of the big, big things that it is doing and try to do things

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.960
[Guest]: which are much more concentrated.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:22.640
[Guest]: Now here one important data point I want to add is, it is not that as countries become

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.960
[Guest]: richer, governments start spending lesser.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.880
[Guest]: For example, there is a very strong correlation between GDP per capita and the percentage

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.240
[Guest]: of government spending in your economy.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:40.760
[Guest]: For example, US governments, all levels combined, spend a lot more than Indian government does.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.160
[Guest]: And Sweden does a lot more than US does.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.880
[Guest]: Around 60% of their GDP is just by the government, can you believe it?

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.680
[Guest]: So that is a given, that will happen.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:56.280
[Guest]: But the way they do is, as you become richer, governments and particularly the union governments

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:02.840
[Guest]: start reducing the areas in which they operate and they focus on just social security, health,

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:09.160
[Guest]: education for example, treatment of the elderly etc. and put in a lot of money in there so

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.180
[Guest]: that you ensure minimum standards that are met.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.120
[Guest]: Now that is what we want India to get to.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.680
[Amit Varma]: And you would say if you want the money to be spent more efficiently, you get it as local

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.960
[Amit Varma]: as possible to the state government or even beyond to local governments or you just get

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.560
[Amit Varma]: it directly to individuals who know their priorities the best.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.560
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.840
[Guest]: So that's where we come to universal basic income.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.720
[Guest]: Think of it, we were talking about cash transfer to the state government, UBI is just an extension

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.760
[Guest]: that it is a cash transfer directly to the individual, like you said.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.920
[Guest]: So now that there is this argument for UBI, the best way to do about is cut a lot of these

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:50.560
[Guest]: centrally sponsored schemes where not only is the cost of you selecting people, but employing

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.400
[Guest]: people to select these people and then give them money is a lot more.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:59.640
[Guest]: So the better argument is yeah, you give them a universal basic income and then let them

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.840
[Amit Varma]: decide what they deem is best for them.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:08.440
[Amit Varma]: But one of the logics for the UBI is that you cut off all other spending and then you

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.600
[Amit Varma]: empower individuals by giving them the UBI, but that will never happen in India, right?

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.200
[Guest]: Spending never gets cut, essentially.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:20.320
[Guest]: Spending does, yeah, it's always a political economy question, there will be entrance interest,

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.320
[Guest]: it is difficult.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:27.520
[Guest]: But for example, the big three subsidies at the union government level are food, fertilizer

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.400
[Guest]: and petroleum.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.120
[Guest]: Now over the last one or two years, there has been a decrease in the subsidy levels

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.480
[Guest]: of all three.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.640
[Guest]: So there are pathways in which you can do, for example, they did this give it up thing,

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.640
[Guest]: right?

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.440
[Guest]: I don't know how many people subscribed it, but they did show that the subsidy which was

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.040
[Guest]: being availed out of this did get reduced.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.560
[Guest]: So that is the way you would have to go.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:57.360
[Guest]: And some of these things can just be done today if the government decides.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.200
[Guest]: For example, fertilizer subsidy is not given to the farmer, it is given to the company

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.080
[Guest]: which manufactures fertilizer.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.440
[Guest]: Now there is absolutely no reason why the government can take it off.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.240
[Guest]: Of course, it will be politically unpopular.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.040
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, that's the tough call.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.680
[Guest]: Why not just give the cash to the farmer and let him decide what his priorities are.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.920
[Guest]: That is what UBI would do.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:21.920
[Guest]: So if you want to protect the farmer, why are you taking such an indirect route helping

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:27.260
[Guest]: a company and then company manufacturing, absolutely inefficient way of doing it.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.000
[Amit Varma]: So at this point, I'll take a slight digression before I ask my next question.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.320
[Amit Varma]: If you go over to Pragati, the magazine that both Pranay and I work for at thinkpragati.com

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.240
[Amit Varma]: and you go to the reforms 2.0 section, you'll find a piece on exactly this by Pranay, where

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.200
[Amit Varma]: he argues that centrally sponsored schemes should be reduced to 10.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.520
[Amit Varma]: Because that's a manageable number that takes care of all the core areas in which you need

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.120
[Amit Varma]: to ensure that stuff happens.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.220
[Amit Varma]: Besides that, what other immediate suggestions do you have which are immediately implementable

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.600
[Amit Varma]: in practical terms?

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.880
[Guest]: In the context of centrally sponsored government schemes?

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.200
[Guest]: Yeah, one thing that if they don't want to reduce the number of schemes, one thing they

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:11.680
[Guest]: can do and the government has been talking about it is make them outcome oriented as

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:18.080
[Guest]: in focus a lot more on what is the outcome achieved out of this spending.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.440
[Guest]: And according to that, you give the next tranche of money.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.280
[Guest]: Currently, it happens, it's just on utilization.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.920
[Guest]: So if you are a state and you have utilized all your money, you can apply for another

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.920
[Guest]: round of funds.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.920
[Guest]: So some states have mastered the art of utilization, without bothering about how much of an impact

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.920
[Guest]: it is having.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:42.080
[Guest]: So one way to in the short term to reform the centrally sponsored scheme is just to

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:47.840
[Guest]: have outcome monitoring and ensure that this money is spent on what it is supposed to be

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.840
[Amit Varma]: spent on.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.760
[Amit Varma]: Pranay, it was a pleasure talking to you.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.360
[Amit Varma]: And before I end this episode, I want to leave with specific good wishes for you.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:00.240
[Amit Varma]: I hope one of these days you get a call from the PMO and they tell you that, listen, we

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.040
[Amit Varma]: have a new centrally sponsored government scheme and we are putting you in charge.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:10.440
[Amit Varma]: And when you ask what that scheme is, they'll say it's RCGSS, Reduce Centrally Government

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.440
[Amit Varma]: Schemes Abhiyan.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.440
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.440
[Amit Varma]: Thanks for coming on the show, Pranay.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.160
[Amit Varma]: Thanks Amit.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.800
[Amit Varma]: To read more about Pranay's thoughts on this, head on over to our magazine Pragati at thinkpragati.com.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:29.880
[Amit Varma]: Go to the Reforms 2.0 section and search for an article by Pranay titled 10 Little Schemes.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:35.360
[Amit Varma]: And as for all of you sick of listening to my bad dreams, fine, I'll give you a break.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:46.160
[Amit Varma]: Next week, I'm going to read out a song instead.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.960
[Unknown]: Next week on The Seen and The Unseen, Amit Verma will be talking to Madhu Menon about

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.680
[Unknown]: restaurant regulations.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.600
