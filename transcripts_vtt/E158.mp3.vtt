00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880
[Amit Varma]: While planning this episode of the scene in the unseen, I was filled with gratitude at

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.800
[Amit Varma]: one point, gratitude for my independence. No one tells me who to call on my show or

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.280
[Amit Varma]: what to discuss. As far as the content of the show is concerned, I'm a one man team.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.640
[Amit Varma]: As far as the production of it is concerned, I had teamed up with a podcast production

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.280
[Amit Varma]: house for a while. But now I produce the show myself. I've contracted with my editor Vijay

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.040
[Amit Varma]: Doifode and my illustrator Alika Gupta. And while we work together, I make all the decisions.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.880
[Amit Varma]: No mybop interferes from on top. And I have no difficulty distributing the show and getting

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.760
[Amit Varma]: to such a vast audience. It would not be like this if I worked for a mainstream media house

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.960
[Amit Varma]: today, even if I would have made much more money working for one. I thought of this while

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.680
[Amit Varma]: reading the excellent book, Twitter and tear gas by Zeynep Tufekci, where she quoted a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.360
[Amit Varma]: journalist in Turkey, who once said the following words to her, which frankly could be said

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.200
[Amit Varma]: in India in 2020. The unnamed journalist said, quote, I first censor myself, as I know I'll

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.280
[Amit Varma]: be in trouble if I write something critical of the government. And then my editor censors

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.560
[Amit Varma]: me if I haven't been mild enough. And then owners of the newspaper also check to make

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.040
[Amit Varma]: sure nothing too critical gets through. And if something is published anyway, especially

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.280
[Amit Varma]: if in defiance, someone from the government calls our boss, and then the tax inspectors

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.520
[Amit Varma]: are sent in to find something to find the newspapers with. Stop good. This quote is

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.040
[Amit Varma]: from Turkey. And this kind of clampdown of the media ensures that the media can often

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.880
[Amit Varma]: be a propaganda machine. Take the problem of the Kurds. For example, the Turkish people

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.400
[Amit Varma]: were constantly brainwashed with misinformation about the Kurds. For example, Tufekci writes,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.800
[Amit Varma]: quote, during the military regime of the 1980s, the Kurds were referred to in the mass media

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.760
[Amit Varma]: as mountain Turks, Turks who were a little misguided about the ethnicity and language,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.760
[Amit Varma]: rather than an actual minority. This was of course ridiculous. Turkish and Kurdish don't

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.460
[Amit Varma]: even belong to the same language family. But in the censored military regime, such outlandish

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.560
[Amit Varma]: claims could be made with a straight face. Stop good. A few years later, something happened

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.680
[Amit Varma]: that could be considered a routine incident. Turkish military jets flew near the Iraq border

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.360
[Amit Varma]: and bombed and killed 34 Kurdish smugglers. Smuggling was routine, the authorities knew

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.880
[Amit Varma]: about it. And at worst, you'd arrest smugglers and give them a shakedown, not bomb them with

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.560
[Amit Varma]: military jets. Anyway, the Turkish military then spun the incident. And all that was reported

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.840
[Amit Varma]: in the news was that a few terrorists had been killed at the border. Reporters and managers

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.680
[Amit Varma]: at mainstream media outlets were uneasy. They knew something was off, but they couldn't

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.760
[Amit Varma]: report it. Then one reporter, Sardar Akinan, working in a newsroom where his bosses had

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.400
[Amit Varma]: shut out the incident, took the initiative. He bought a plane ticket on his own dime,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.640
[Amit Varma]: flew to the nearest airport, took a cab and went to the village, which was the center

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.480
[Amit Varma]: of the action. As he entered the village, he spotted what Tufekci describes as quote,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.440
[Amit Varma]: a snaking line of coffins coming down a small hill as families wailed all around. Stop good.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.040
[Amit Varma]: The coffins passed him and went on and on. The wailing went on and on. Akinan broke down.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.120
[Amit Varma]: In another day and age in the 1980s or the 1990s, this would have been the private grief

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.960
[Amit Varma]: of a surprised outsider. But this was 2011. Akinan took out his smartphone and snapped

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.880
[Amit Varma]: a picture of the snaking coffins. He put it on Instagram. He put it on Twitter. And soon

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:38.760
[Unknown]: the whole world knew. Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.160
[Unknown]: politics and behavioral science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma. Welcome to The Seen

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.080
[Amit Varma]: and the Unseen. My subject for today is radically networked societies. Once upon a time, there

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.160
[Amit Varma]: were constraints to how fast and how much information could get out. Constraints of

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.240
[Amit Varma]: both technology and the coercive state. But today, thanks to the internet and smartphones

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.160
[Amit Varma]: and social media, we are radically networked. One of the consequences of this is what we

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.340
[Amit Varma]: saw in the famous Arab Spring of almost a decade ago, with popular uprisings in country

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.680
[Amit Varma]: after country enabled by technology forming spontaneously from the bottom up instead of

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.720
[Amit Varma]: directed from the top. Reading Tufekci's book Twitter and Tear Gas, I was struck by some

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.320
[Amit Varma]: of the parallels between those protests and the protests that have erupted in India over

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.060
[Amit Varma]: the last few weeks. My eyes almost popped out in fact when Tufekci wrote about how one

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.640
[Amit Varma]: common element to many of these protests was that a library would spring up in the middle

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.280
[Amit Varma]: of it. And I thought of Shaheen Bagh. Democracy, it struck me, must surely be deeper in a radically

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.680
[Amit Varma]: networked society. But there are also challenges. One challenge is that there is a flip side

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.920
[Amit Varma]: to this as well. And radical networking can also be used to spread misinformation, such

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.440
[Amit Varma]: as rumours about outsiders kidnapping children that have led to so many lynchings in India.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.400
[Amit Varma]: Also there is a question of whether the coercive power of the state, also enhanced by technology,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.440
[Amit Varma]: is still too strong to counter. From a philosophical perspective also, questions arise about how

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.280
[Amit Varma]: the state should deal with the ill effects of such radical networking. There has always

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.680
[Amit Varma]: been a trade-off between liberty and security. Is this a false binary? If not, how do we

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.980
[Amit Varma]: traverse this new landscape? To discuss this, I've invited my friend Pranay Kutasane, one

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.920
[Amit Varma]: of the smartest people I know in India, who I absolutely love discussing ideas with. Pranay

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.360
[Amit Varma]: works at the Takshashila Institution in Bengaluru, and he has not just thought deeply about the

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.280
[Amit Varma]: subject of this episode, he has also taught it. But before we get to our discussion, let's

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:48.760
[Amit Varma]: take a quick commercial break. If you're listening to the seen and the unseen, it means you like

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.400
[Amit Varma]: listening to audio and you're thirsty for knowledge. That being the case, I'd urge you

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.640
[Amit Varma]: to check out Storytel, the sponsors of this episode. Storytel is an audiobook platform

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.260
[Amit Varma]: that has a massive range of audiobooks from around the world. Their international collection

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.880
[Amit Varma]: is stellar, but so is a local collection. They have a fantastic range of Marathi and

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.160
[Amit Varma]: Hindi audiobooks. What's more, I do a weekly podcast there called The Book Club with Amit

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.960
[Amit Varma]: Verma, in which I talk about one book every week, giving context, giving you a taste of

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.380
[Amit Varma]: it, and so on. Download that app and listen to my show. And as long as Storytel sponsors

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.000
[Amit Varma]: this show within this commercial itself, I will recommend an audiobook that I liked on

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.160
[Amit Varma]: that platform every week. My recommendation for this week is At the Mountains of Madness

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.600
[Amit Varma]: by H.P. Lovecraft. This has been described as a science fiction horror novella, but it's

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.640
[Amit Varma]: mad delights cannot be adequately explained in genre terms. Lovecraft writes an L-rich

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.440
[Amit Varma]: overblown prose that is so very bad that it is very, very good. And there is a cult around

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.680
[Amit Varma]: his writing, of which I am a devoted member. At the Mountains of Madness by H.P. Lovecraft

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:03.440
[Amit Varma]: on Storytel. Download their app or visit Storytel.com. Remember that's Storytel with a single L,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.440
[Amit Varma]: Storytel.com.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.800
[Amit Varma]: Pranay, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.800
[Amit Varma]: Thanks, Amit.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.480
[Amit Varma]: Pranay, one of the, you know, the things that I really like about you and why all our discussions

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.560
[Amit Varma]: is so much fun, and why I even learned from your attitude is that I find that you never

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.880
[Amit Varma]: really take hard positions and speak with certainty about everything. You've always

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.400
[Amit Varma]: got this intellectual humility and this openness to actually listening to what the other person

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.160
[Amit Varma]: says. And like in an episode I did a few weeks back, Paramita Vohra referred to a certain

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.560
[Amit Varma]: class of pandit as men with beards. And it strikes me that even though you have a beard,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:43.080
[Amit Varma]: you're not a man with beard, you could say Schrodinger's beard. So kind of tell me about

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.240
[Amit Varma]: your attraction to policy and the kind of studies that you do, the kind of fields that

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.320
[Amit Varma]: you work in, and you know how that has been shaped over the years.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.800
[Guest]: Yeah. So first of all, that happens because I really don't know much. So still trying

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:02.760
[Guest]: to learn. That's the main reason. And I think the way I have looked at a lot of policy spaces,

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:08.520
[Guest]: I try to call myself an aspiring Harfan Maula. So I want to learn a lot of things, right?

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:15.160
[Guest]: So the frame that I use is that there are lots of disciplines, like you have economic

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:21.220
[Guest]: reasoning, you have psychology, you have cognitive science, etc. And you can at least get a few

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.960
[Guest]: frameworks from those and then apply them across domains. For example, there's a lot

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:32.640
[Guest]: of public finance work that can apply to geopolitics. So I truly believe new knowledge generation

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.120
[Guest]: happens at the intersection of disciplines, not necessarily in the pigeonhole disciplines

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.000
[Guest]: as they are right now. And I'm just trying to explore them.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.920
[Amit Varma]: And would that be because people who are stuck into one particular discipline and you don't

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.840
[Amit Varma]: have that multidisciplinary interest, think in particular rigid ways and one way of breaking

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.680
[Amit Varma]: out of that is by getting insights, which might have popped up in other disciplines

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.280
[Guest]: and that kind of informs it.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.880
[Guest]: Absolutely. Yeah. So let me just give an example, right? So we always talk about, say, foreign

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:08.560
[Guest]: aid, you know, how has US's aid to Pakistan affected it? Or how is China giving money

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:15.040
[Guest]: in the form of CPEC going to affect Pakistan? Now, conventionally, you will have geopolitical

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:23.560
[Guest]: analysts looking at really what did CPEC lead to a new power industry or did it lead to

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:28.080
[Guest]: new transportation, things like that, right? And what were the political relationships?

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.920
[Guest]: But just look at it, public finances, there is a whole bunch of literature which talks

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:39.240
[Guest]: about what happens when you give grants to another government, right? Does that lead

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.480
[Guest]: to actually increase in the supply of what you wanted, the product that you wanted to

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.200
[Guest]: increase, right? Or if you don't give a grant, and instead you give a voucher, you know,

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.680
[Guest]: you will start a scheme to actually do certain things, a centrally sponsored scheme kind

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.720
[Guest]: of thing. What is the impact of that? So these are already analysed in another discipline.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:04.680
[Guest]: So maybe you can apply some insights from that and get a new knowledge generation happening.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.760
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned economic thinking, which is probably what I do too much of perhaps.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.280
[Amit Varma]: And when you were saying this, I just thought back to when I was, you know, travelling through

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.400
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan in 2006, I was covering the cricket tour there. But I also was writing for the

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.520
[Amit Varma]: Wall Street Journal and doing other stories and blogging from there. And someone told

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:29.680
[Amit Varma]: me at the time that it was in Pakistan's interest to keep the war on terror going, because Pakistan

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.320
[Amit Varma]: had now become, it was almost a failing state before 9-11. And it had now become completely

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:41.080
[Amit Varma]: reliant on foreign aid, which was a lifeline. And my Pakistani friend said to me that Al-Qaeda

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.760
[Amit Varma]: should actually be called Al-Faida. And I thought of it from the point of view of incentives

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.360
[Amit Varma]: and whatever the geopolitical imperatives may be, it is clearly obvious that just looking

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.400
[Amit Varma]: at the incentives, they are going to keep terror going.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:59.840
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah. And things like trade-offs and opportunity costs, these are applicable across

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.520
[Guest]: disciplines, right? So yeah, economic reasoning is the study of human behavior. And that's

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:11.080
[Guest]: why it applies to so many other things. A man after my own heart, come to my arms.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.280
[Guest]: So I have listened to all the episodes.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.360
[Amit Varma]: You have been on some of the episodes. And I have to tell my listeners, please, I will

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.080
[Amit Varma]: link some of those earlier episodes from the show notes. But Pranay is being extremely

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:27.880
[Amit Varma]: modest when he says that his openness comes from not knowing much. He knows a lot about

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.640
[Amit Varma]: a lot of areas. You're considered in many circles, like a foreign policy expert or an

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:38.560
[Amit Varma]: IR expert. Is that fair? Or is that sort of pigeonholing you again?

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:45.040
[Guest]: I'm not an expert, first. So I'm a foreign policy student, and I'm really interested

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:51.440
[Guest]: in finding things out about that. So yeah, and I do some things on public finance and

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.640
[Guest]: some work on public policy. That's also a lot of my interest. I really like to understand

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:02.160
[Guest]: why certain policies change, when that policy change happens, when it doesn't, things like

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.880
[Guest]: that. Like just for now, for example, fast tag implementation is going on in India. So

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.880
[Guest]: it's a natural experiment for us to investigate, right? Why is the implementation so shitty

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.120
[Guest]: as it is? And what are the steps that government is going to take? How is this going to work

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.280
[Guest]: out? That really thrills me. Let's see how it goes.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.920
[Amit Varma]: And other, you know, before we get to the subject at hand, since you, one last question,

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:32.640
[Amit Varma]: since you sort of started your career and to the point where you are now, is there any

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.880
[Amit Varma]: fundamental way in which your thinking has changed?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:41.840
[Guest]: Yes. So I come from an engineering background, right? Like many of us here, it's just like

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:51.280
[Guest]: a rite of passage. After 12th, you do engineering. So until then, once I came here, in this field,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:57.280
[Guest]: I think economic reasoning was something that truly blew my mind, right? Because you always

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:03.520
[Guest]: had this idea of trade-offs in the back of your mind, but you could never articulate

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.880
[Guest]: it in a way that makes sense across a lot of disciplines and across a lot of questions

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.320
[Guest]: which come to mind. So I think economic reasoning brought that fundamental change in thinking.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:20.280
[Guest]: So now any question that comes up, you have a set of tools, at least to start off with.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.800
[Guest]: And based on that, you can then explore more ideas.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.040
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you know, if I were to ask myself a similar question, one of the concepts that

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.120
[Amit Varma]: really blew my mind when I internalized and understood it is something very relevant to

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:37.840
[Amit Varma]: the subject of this episode, which is spontaneous order, which of course is how there are beyond

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.160
[Amit Varma]: a certain level of complexity, you can no longer direct things from the top. You know,

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.280
[Amit Varma]: no one designs a language or gives dictates on how a word should be used. It evolves spontaneously.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:53.200
[Amit Varma]: It's spontaneous order. You know, markets work like that. Societies work like that.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.720
[Amit Varma]: And we see a lot more of this action in radically networked societies. Now, before we sort of

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.120
[Amit Varma]: start talking about it, I want to kind of divide this episode into two broad themes.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.880
[Amit Varma]: One is about radically networked societies or RNS, which is a short form we can use to

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.480
[Amit Varma]: sort of understand what has changed and what is the nature of the change and what are the

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.680
[Amit Varma]: trade-offs involved and what are the difficulties they pose. And the second part to talk about

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:22.320
[Amit Varma]: something that you've written about at length also about how the state should respond to

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.120
[Amit Varma]: these changes in society, because society, of course, is, you know, now flat and radically

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.800
[Amit Varma]: networked, but societies remain very hierarchical and still stuck in old structure. So let's

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.680
[Amit Varma]: kind of start with definitions. What is a radically networked society?

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:39.000
[Guest]: Yeah, so this term radically networked societies, Nitin, my colleague coined it, and we've been

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.920
[Guest]: working together to explore this in greater detail. So radically networked society or

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:49.600
[Guest]: radically networked community, definitionally, is a web of connected individuals possessing

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:55.120
[Guest]: an identity, which is either imagined or real, and are motivated by a common immediate cause.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:01.520
[Guest]: Okay, so look at it as a triangle, which has three elements to it. One is the scale. So

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.640
[Guest]: the networked aspect is the scale. One is a sociological aspect, which is the identity.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:11.680
[Guest]: And one is a political aspect, which is a cause. So when these three things come together,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.520
[Guest]: what you have is a radically networked society. At this point, I would like to say that the

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:21.800
[Guest]: word radical is not, we are not talking about the terrorism and radicalization, that area,

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.880
[Guest]: the radical here just means fundamentally networked societies, right? So that is what

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:31.760
[Guest]: we are referring to. Now, why is it important, right? So the significant change that has

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:39.120
[Guest]: happened in the information age is that our societies are now fundamentally networked,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.600
[Guest]: whereas our states are still optimized for the industrial age, right? So they are like

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:50.600
[Guest]: you said, right, top to down, they are structured in a way that information has to flow from

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:56.080
[Guest]: the bottom to the up, all decision making is concentrated at the top. So the states

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:01.240
[Guest]: are functioned like that, like just think of a company 100 years ago, right, which is

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:07.360
[Guest]: doing on a shop floor. So the state is somewhat similar in organization. So decision making

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.960
[Guest]: happens at the top, information flows are slow, latency exists, etc. Now, contrast that

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.560
[Guest]: with how the society exists now. With the internet, you have people who are radically

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.480
[Guest]: networked with each other, and the information flows are fundamentally different now, right?

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.720
[Guest]: So in the protests also, for example, that you see, we call this leaderless, right? But

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.320
[Guest]: actually it means there are multiple leaders, right? So there are multiple leaders and information

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:38.880
[Guest]: flows are happening from one node to the other without necessarily being coordinated by one

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:45.920
[Guest]: guy who is controlling this entire function, right? So that's why societies are networked,

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.840
[Guest]: information flows are different, whereas the state which is still hierarchically structured,

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.960
[Guest]: the information flow is quite different. So latency, let's say you organize a radically

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.640
[Guest]: networked protest today, right? And the state needs to respond. Now, how will the state

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:07.720
[Guest]: respond? There will be a police who will probably hear about this, if the WhatsApp message reaches

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.480
[Guest]: you, then they will go to the, let's say, the Commissioner of Bangalore, and then after

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:18.160
[Guest]: that it will go to the Home Minister here, then they'll decide. And by that time, the

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.240
[Guest]: protest has already started, right? Because the information flows in societies are very

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.880
[Guest]: different. So that is how we sort of conceptualize this. And all these protests that have been

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:35.880
[Guest]: happening since 2011, have an element of this digital network tools being used to actually

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.840
[Guest]: create these protests and manage them. So that's how we came to it.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.320
[Amit Varma]: And what you and Nitin, this is Nitin Pai, of course, who runs the Takshashla Institution,

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.120
[Amit Varma]: what you guys elaborated on in your joint paper, which I'll link from the show notes,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.040
[Amit Varma]: are the three essential properties of radically networked societies where you talk about a

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:58.560
[Amit Varma]: sociological aspect, a political aspect, and a networked aspect. And here, I'll quickly

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.960
[Amit Varma]: clarify that in my introduction, when I spoke of radically networked society, my conception

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.360
[Amit Varma]: of it was society in large and is radically networked. And where you are sort of defining

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:12.120
[Amit Varma]: it and we'll continue speaking about it in these terms, as we go deeper, is more of these

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.280
[Amit Varma]: sort of communities that form, for example, these communities during times of protests,

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.120
[Amit Varma]: like we saw in the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, and so on. And like, to some extent,

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.800
[Amit Varma]: we have seen in India over the last few weeks. So, you know, can you elaborate on each of

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.960
[Amit Varma]: these sociological aspect, political aspect, network aspect?

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:36.520
[Guest]: Yeah. So let's start with this. Let's discuss what are some examples of movements or entities

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.120
[Guest]: which are not radically networked society. So that sort of helps clarify the frame. So

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:47.000
[Guest]: let's look at examples of communities which have scalability and an identity aspect, but

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.280
[Guest]: are yet to find a cause. Okay, so for an example for that is fan clubs. Okay, so when you have

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.760
[Guest]: these fan clubs, which are there, so you have an imagined identity, I'm a Rajinikanth fan,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:03.120
[Guest]: or I am Amitabh Bachchan fan. I've been told by Shah Rukh Khan fans. Right.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:09.080
[Guest]: So you have a strong imagined identity, which brings people from across the places together,

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.520
[Guest]: right? Something which motivates you to come together. And it might even be an online fan

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.800
[Guest]: club, or it might just be very well networked offline as well. So you can have the scalability

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:24.080
[Guest]: aspect. But there is no immediate cause to mobilize this particular fan club, right?

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.800
[Guest]: So this is one type of entity, which is not yet a radically networked society.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Unless Amit Verma has written a nasty review of Raees, which becomes a temporary cause.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:40.800
[Guest]: Yeah, that might bring together people, right? But generally it doesn't. Let's take another

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:46.760
[Guest]: example, right? Example of community mobilizations, which have cause and a scalability aspect,

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.440
[Guest]: but a much weaker identity. Okay. An example for that is like you have these change.org

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.200
[Guest]: petition drives that happen. So you have a scalability aspect because through internet

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:01.080
[Guest]: you are connected to a lot of people. People say Bangalore, you want to fix a street and

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.920
[Guest]: there will be people from across the world who will be pitching in on this. And there

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:12.000
[Guest]: is also the cause, which is the roads, et cetera. But again, there is no identity aspect

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.080
[Guest]: here, very weak. So it is not a radically networked society.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.200
[Guest]: Let's look at the third one. Examples of community mobilizations, which have cause and which

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.760
[Guest]: also have an identity, but have not been able to scale their protests. Now, an example of

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:32.000
[Guest]: this is many localized protests, which happen. So I'm sure like Shiv Sena organizes a bandh

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.600
[Guest]: in Andheri, okay. For a particular thing that's happening there, a local protest. So that

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.840
[Guest]: is an example where there might be a cause and there might be an identity element also

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.640
[Guest]: involved, but it is not scaling it. So this is another example where it is not yet a radical

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.680
[Guest]: network societies. Now, only when these three things come together, that's when you have

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:58.920
[Guest]: a very potent mix, where you can have large amount of mobilizations, which can sustain

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:05.760
[Guest]: over large periods of time and can challenge the state significantly as well. So an example

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.800
[Guest]: of what is a radically network society, right? So for example, I would say the Ram Mandir

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.880
[Guest]: movement was an example of a radically network societies before the advent of the internet

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.680
[Guest]: as well, right? So you had a strong identity and imagined identity, the Hindu identity,

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.320
[Guest]: right? You had a cause, you wanted to build a temple and it was networked as well because

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.960
[Guest]: they were able to mobilize people across India towards this cause. So it was a radically

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:37.520
[Guest]: network. Grassroots workers were like physical routers. Yes. Yeah. And then you also have

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:43.400
[Guest]: more recent examples, right? Like the Patidar mobilization, which happened in Surat by Hardik

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:48.280
[Guest]: Patel, that also had a radically networked element. So the immediate cause was regarding

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:55.520
[Guest]: jobs and reservation. The identity was this Patidar identity. And the scale was through

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.480
[Guest]: the internet. A lot of Facebook groups and WhatsApp groups were used to mobilize these

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.800
[Guest]: protests. So this is what radically network societies are. Why are they important? So

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:12.400
[Guest]: why is this imagined identity part important, right? So even though these radically network

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.400
[Guest]: societies, a few of them, like we discussed, existed in the past, the internet as a medium

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:22.760
[Guest]: has thoroughly changed that scalability aspect of it, right? It has changed the speed of

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:30.560
[Guest]: communication. It has seen the depth of communication. So that is making it easier to bring latent

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:37.360
[Guest]: identities and causes to the fore, or sometimes even creating new identities and new causes,

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:42.800
[Guest]: which was not as much possible before the internet. It did exist, but now it has reached

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:48.720
[Guest]: a completely different level, right? And that's why you see lots of these protests where consumers

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.960
[Guest]: are coming to oppose something which didn't happen earlier. You would have protests by

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:58.720
[Guest]: workers, but now they are protested by consumers. So that is what is different now.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.600
[Amit Varma]: And so I'll briefly sum it up. When you talk about the sociological aspect, what you mean

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:08.280
[Amit Varma]: is that's a shared imagined identity, to use Benedict Anderson's phrase. When you talk

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:13.080
[Amit Varma]: about the political aspect, you mean the cause. And when you talk about the network aspect,

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.580
[Amit Varma]: you mean the, you know, the speed and scalability, which is today, of course, enabled by technology

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.480
[Amit Varma]: and a couple of interesting points you made. One, by giving the example of the Ram Mandir,

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:27.840
[Amit Varma]: you pointed out that RNSs existed before the internet. And another classic example of that,

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.840
[Amit Varma]: where you see the role of the internet played by something else is the people spring in

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.160
[Amit Varma]: 1848, like the Arab spring of 2010, 2011 was actually named after the people spring of

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.520
[Amit Varma]: 1848, which had, you know, the sociological aspect, which had, you know, those common

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.880
[Amit Varma]: identities, which had a political cause, and their scalability came from the popularity

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:52.080
[Amit Varma]: of newspapers and telegraphs. And especially and most people don't think of it as a channel

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:57.520
[Amit Varma]: of communication, but especially of railways, because railways were what ferried newspapers

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:03.200
[Amit Varma]: and books and pamphlets across the country. So think of it as like a meatspace version

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.320
[Amit Varma]: of the internet who say such a thing, shame on me. And the other thing that also struck

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:14.000
[Amit Varma]: me when you mentioned the party that agitation was that a liberal listening to this may put

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.120
[Amit Varma]: a halo around RNS because you know, he can look at a lot of agitations, which he identifies

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.240
[Amit Varma]: with which have happened because of this radical networking. But it's a value agnostic term,

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.480
[Amit Varma]: radically networked society can also be a community which for example, assembles to

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.760
[Amit Varma]: carry out pogroms at large scale. And we'll talk about some of the sort of negative aspects

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.160
[Amit Varma]: of this after a while. And I was also sort of struck by this phrase I came across while

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.160
[Amit Varma]: prepping for the episode, which was Ethan Zuckerman's cute cat theory. And you've heard

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:48.040
[Amit Varma]: this phrase? No, no. So the cute cat theory is this, that earlier when you're communicating

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:54.120
[Amit Varma]: via technology, the most effective mediums are the most effective ways to communicate

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:59.400
[Amit Varma]: are through social media, which people at large are using anyway, they're not using

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.480
[Amit Varma]: for this purpose. So the thing is, people might be using Facebook to share pictures

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:08.400
[Amit Varma]: of cute cats, therefore the cute cat theory, but and and that therefore becomes the most

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.320
[Amit Varma]: effective way to build a revolution, because a lot of people are there for cute cats, and

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:18.280
[Amit Varma]: then you feed them your evolution. So which is sort of quite fascinating. Yeah, you don't

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:24.040
[Guest]: need to create a different medium as such for creating a revolution, right? Actually,

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:29.440
[Guest]: the reason is you want people at the margin to be supportive of these, right? So people

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:34.680
[Guest]: at the margin will be supportive of this if they can participate in it at lower costs

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.760
[Guest]: to them, right? So if you are on Facebook for a bunch of other things, and you just

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:43.160
[Guest]: see these things coming up the cost for me to engage with this really low as against

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:49.000
[Guest]: you saying you install this revolution TM app, and we will cause a revolution then people

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.840
[Guest]: only the already converted will participate in it. And the low cost also means that let's

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.480
[Amit Varma]: say some influencer tweets something which I really like and I retweet it, my action

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.800
[Amit Varma]: of retweeting it sends it to all of my followers, you know, so the scalability that you can

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:10.000
[Amit Varma]: reach with these tools of Facebook, like Twitter, retweet are just kind of off the charts. What

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.600
[Amit Varma]: are sort of like having looked at radically network societies and such movements come

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:19.720
[Amit Varma]: up over the last few years, and I'm referring to those specifically now enabled by the internet

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:24.200
[Amit Varma]: and social media. What are the things what are the commonalities that you'd say that

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:31.080
[Guest]: they share? Yeah. So protests are one of the manifestations of radically network societies,

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.040
[Guest]: right? Like we discussed, they could also be flash mobs, they could be lynching mobs,

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.000
[Guest]: which has been the case in India. But now let's look at protests in and what have what

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.720
[Guest]: have been the commonalities across the last few years in that. So when we talk about protests,

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:52.880
[Guest]: a few common things are first, a large number of these protesters have been young across

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.320
[Guest]: the world wherever these have taken place. Okay, so maybe it has to do with these are

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:04.840
[Guest]: the young people who are at comfort with the scalable aspect of this RNS. They are native

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.920
[Amit Varma]: to that and hence they have been able to use it because technology is too flexible. I have

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:13.640
[Amit Varma]: a couple of figures to back this up in in Tunisia, where the Arab Spring all started.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:19.360
[Amit Varma]: Most of the young were unemployed, but the under 30 population in Tunisia was 60% of

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.160
[Amit Varma]: the population of the country. So, you know, their demographic dividend, if you want to

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:29.080
[Amit Varma]: call it that. Similarly, in Egypt, over 54% of Egypt's population as of last year was

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:35.400
[Amit Varma]: made up of the under 24 demographic. And in 2011, 24 million Egyptians were between the

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:41.920
[Amit Varma]: ages of 15 to 29. And, you know, in the demographic security field, apparently the term they use

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:49.400
[Guest]: for this is fighting age. Okay, so that is one. The second thing is it's not just that

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.680
[Guest]: these are the young people. These are young people who are connected to the Internet,

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:59.560
[Guest]: right? And in Tunisia case, also a large number of the penetration of the Internet was significantly

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:05.240
[Guest]: high as well. So what is different about Internet? Like we discussed, it allows people with really

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:11.920
[Guest]: dispersed interests also to mobilize at lower costs and at higher scales. That is significantly

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:18.520
[Guest]: different. And that's what you see in these products. Third thing is they are not necessarily

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:23.840
[Guest]: the poorest people who are protesting, which is again backed by theory earlier that it's

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:29.600
[Guest]: the opportunity cost for a person who is at the poorest rung is too high to get engaged

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:35.760
[Guest]: in any political activism of sort. So it will be people who will be disaffected. So unemployed

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.160
[Guest]: people, but still people who can afford a mobile, people who can read things, etc. Right.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:46.480
[Amit Varma]: So that is another aspect. And also largely, you know, as protests go on and become prolonged,

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.680
[Amit Varma]: there'll be a lot, you know, students will be over-represented because working people

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.160
[Amit Varma]: will, for example, the opportunity cost will be high. They can't be there all the time

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:59.720
[Guest]: and so on. Yeah, that's a good point. Then another point which actually Tyler Coven makes

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:06.080
[Guest]: in one of his piece is that this is a lot of these recent protests are consumer protests

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:11.360
[Guest]: rather than worker protests. So conventionally, we think of workers mobilizing quickly because

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:17.640
[Guest]: they have a leadership structure. They have a cause, a policy change which affects them

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.680
[Guest]: in a concentrated manner. So it is not difficult for them to, you know, protest because they

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:29.680
[Guest]: know the benefits of them will be accruing to all of them. But when you are a consumer,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:35.000
[Guest]: the benefits of any policy change are actually quite dispersed. So it's quite easy for a

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.160
[Guest]: government to do client politics. So there's a Wilson's matrix in public policy which says

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:47.960
[Guest]: that if the benefits for a policy change are concentrated, whereas the cost of that policy

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:52.360
[Guest]: change are dispersed, that kind of politics is easy to do. And that's what many of the

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:58.480
[Guest]: governments do, right? So let's say you raise tax and you float Air India. OK, classic case

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:06.480
[Guest]: of client politics. But with the Internet, it is now possible for consumers who are affected

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:11.960
[Guest]: in a dispersed manner to still come together at lower costs and at higher scales. So that's

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.440
[Guest]: where you see a lot of the protests in the recent year. I'll just give a few examples

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:23.000
[Guest]: are consumer protests. So, for example, in Chile, metro prices hike led to a huge protest

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.560
[Guest]: a few months back. In Ecuador, the protesters have been demanding restoration of fuel subsidies.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:37.960
[Guest]: Medium prices again have a role to play in the Haitian protests there. In Lebanon, there

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:44.760
[Guest]: has been a tax levied on WhatsApp and that led to protests. Even in Uganda, something

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:50.480
[Guest]: similar. Again, in Sudan, there has been food and fuel subsidies. So they took away a bit

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:55.960
[Guest]: of subsidies and that led to consumers being able to mobilize on a large scale. So what

00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.840
[Guest]: you see is consumers are able to sort of mobilize. To an extent, even you could say like say

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.720
[Amit Varma]: India against corruption, for example, would also be. Would you call that a consumer's

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.680
[Guest]: protest because they're consumers of government services? Absolutely. And corruption as such

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:17.000
[Guest]: is a dispersed cause to a lot of people. Right. So but yet people were able to mobilize on

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.800
[Guest]: one identity that we are all the disaffected people because of this evil called corruption.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:30.200
[Guest]: So it created that new imagined identity. Right. And the cause immediately was instances

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:35.800
[Guest]: which kept coming up during that time frame about government corruption, 2G and all those

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:41.080
[Guest]: things. And that led people to coalesce around it. So one of the the question that I have

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:46.200
[Amit Varma]: here and which is sort of a mystery to me is that, OK, so, you know, whenever I read

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.560
[Amit Varma]: public choice theory, I'm always kind of or applied to something. I'm filled with a little

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:55.120
[Amit Varma]: bit of despair because, you know, everything seems so intractable. How do we get positive

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:59.360
[Amit Varma]: change happening? An example of that is what you just spoke of, that in so many things,

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:04.400
[Amit Varma]: the benefits are concentrated, the costs are dispersed. So, for example, if the government,

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, puts a tariff on something from outside, you know, all common consumers might

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.680
[Amit Varma]: be paying 10 paisa or 20 paisa or more for the product, but they don't even know that

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.960
[Amit Varma]: and the costs are so dispersed. And similarly, the small retailers who benefit from that

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.360
[Amit Varma]: protectionism can form a lobby and give funds to the government. Or the example you gave

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:25.960
[Amit Varma]: of Air India that all of us are actually paying for it every single day to keep an unprofitable

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.760
[Amit Varma]: airline running. But we don't care because the costs are dispersed. The cost to me for

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.360
[Amit Varma]: Air India could be something like 10 rupees or 20 rupees. I don't even know what it is.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.160
[Amit Varma]: But it's dispersed and it's invisible. So I don't care. So and typically, this then

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:43.520
[Amit Varma]: becomes a reason for skeptics like me to then bemoan the possibility of change because we

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.800
[Amit Varma]: will be like that. How do you motivate people for whom the costs are dispersed and often

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:54.400
[Amit Varma]: invisible to actually come together and protest? And the second point you pointed out also,

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, which from public choice is a free rider effect, which is that, let us say that

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.360
[Amit Varma]: there is something that I want to protest for, but I don't need to protest for it for

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.520
[Amit Varma]: it to happen. I can just let other people protest and I can free ride and benefit without

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:13.600
[Amit Varma]: doing anything. And this is a common cause for why many protests don't take off at all.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:18.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, what I am finding to my immense confusion, and feel free to give me examples from elsewhere

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.160
[Amit Varma]: with that either counter this or demonstrate this. But what I'm finding in India is for

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.480
[Amit Varma]: example, the anti-CAA effect, the anti-CAA protests, a lot of the people who are protesting

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:32.640
[Amit Varma]: aren't directly affected by it and won't even be. You do find a lot of upper caste Hindus

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.360
[Amit Varma]: even joining the protests, while they will really not be affected by this government,

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.680
[Amit Varma]: not this specific policy, everyone's affected by the disaster that is our great economy.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.200
[Amit Varma]: So what motivates so many people, and this is not just about retweeting something where

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.520
[Amit Varma]: you're right, the costs are very low. So you can show your protest by retweeting or being

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:54.400
[Amit Varma]: on Facebook. But you had spontaneous demonstrations throughout the country where people are going

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.680
[Amit Varma]: out on the streets to look at places like Shaheen Bagh, where people are spending days

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:05.360
[Amit Varma]: and nights and days and nights in this horrible winter and amid this pollution to protest.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:10.920
[Guest]: So what's going on here? I don't understand. Yeah, I've thought about this. And sort of

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:17.080
[Guest]: the answer that I can look to if I apply this RNS frame is that the government has been

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:24.040
[Guest]: responsible for creating this imagined identity of people and that imagined identity of people

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:29.680
[Guest]: has only grown because of the actions that government has repeatedly taken, right. And

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:36.120
[Guest]: those, so the CAA, then there was talk about the NRC, now they're saying that NRC doesn't

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:42.720
[Guest]: exist. But and even before that, there have been instances of lynching, etc. And the government's

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:48.720
[Guest]: response was quite lackadaisical, right. So there have been over the last four, five years,

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:54.840
[Guest]: many such actions because of which this imagined identity of people who think, who reject that

00:34:54.840 --> 00:35:01.200
[Guest]: idea has sort of grown over time. And that has led to a significant critical mass of

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:08.440
[Guest]: people being sympathetic to what people who will be affected by this, right. And then

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:15.480
[Guest]: this CAA just becomes a cause, the second leg of this triangle. And that cause eventually

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:20.560
[Guest]: mobilizes people. That's how I have thought I'm sure there must be better answers. So

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.840
[Amit Varma]: what you're saying is that it's cascade of effects, which are then strengthening these

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.960
[Amit Varma]: dissenting identities, so to say, against these guys, and the CAA comes right to the

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.000
[Amit Varma]: end of it. I mean, another thing that struck me, and that is actually heartening, is that

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.840
[Amit Varma]: there isn't any one identity at play. When you look at the anti-CAA protests, you do

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:43.280
[Amit Varma]: have Muslim groups who are out there saying Allahu Akbar, you also have people who are

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.920
[Amit Varma]: saying no, that's not secular, let's not protest that way. And my personal stand is let a thousand

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:51.840
[Amit Varma]: flowers flourish, let everybody protest in whatever way they see fit, no one should dictate

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.160
[Amit Varma]: to others. But there is also a diversity of identity in all this. And of course, they

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:01.600
[Amit Varma]: are united by their antipathy towards a very restrictive idea of India that is now coming

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:07.460
[Amit Varma]: up, which is the Hindu Rashtra idea. But I mean, I'm trying to sort of process this interplay

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:13.040
[Guest]: of identity. Actually, for an imagined community to form, you need two aspects. Okay, one,

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:19.440
[Guest]: you need commonality of certain things, right? Generally, it is language or religion or common

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:24.880
[Guest]: historical experience or whatever. And the second is for you to be able to differentiate

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:30.960
[Guest]: against the other. So here, you have the second element, you're clearly differentiating what

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:37.400
[Guest]: we are not. And the second element, I think, the idea of secular India constitution has

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:44.120
[Guest]: become that element, which is what we are together, what we share. That's why this preamble,

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:50.480
[Guest]: I mean, who would have thought preamble would be, you know, reiterated and repeated on the

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:55.480
[Guest]: streets of India. I mean, that's so there is that element, you know, it's not it's not

00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:00.960
[Guest]: on probably on religious language grounds, but it is still on a shared experience of

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:07.680
[Guest]: probably 70 years of India. And we have a conception of what India is like and what

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:13.520
[Guest]: joins us as Indians. I think that is one element. And don't forget the third node of this, the

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:19.720
[Guest]: scalability aspect of it, right? The internet, being able to communicate these ideas across

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:25.880
[Guest]: India has been a significant boost as well to the protest, right? So these three things

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:32.600
[Amit Varma]: are coming together here as well. And I guess every picture of a protest somewhere makes

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.480
[Amit Varma]: a sympathetic person more likely to go out and protest himself thereby acting against

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.360
[Amit Varma]: the free rider effect. And maybe there is something expressive to that also that by

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.120
[Amit Varma]: going out to protest, you're not, even if you are hopeless about change actually happening,

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:50.040
[Guest]: you are asserting your identity and your values. Yeah, actually, I was just observing this

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:56.640
[Guest]: narrative shift on Twitter, right? First few days was like, why are people protesting?

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:03.200
[Guest]: After a few days, it was why aren't you protesting? Oh, yeah. So I mean, what's wrong with you?

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:08.560
[Guest]: So if you see the it has shifted, if you're a right thinking person, and you believe in

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.480
[Guest]: the idea of India, why weren't you protesting, right? So that narrative shifted. And that

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:20.160
[Guest]: is actually a manifestation of what you said, right? It has now a lot of people have thought

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:25.440
[Guest]: and internet has been able to spread this idea very effectively. And that's why it is

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:30.880
[Guest]: now the norm has shifted that you should be there and you should oppose this. I mean,

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:36.080
[Guest]: there are just two more aspects to what joins some of these protests together. So for example,

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:41.160
[Guest]: one thing is that these protests have been across the political spectrum in the world

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.600
[Guest]: as well, right? So it's not just that only left leaning groups or right leaning groups

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:52.020
[Guest]: have been involved in this. The last one, which I found quite fascinating was that migration

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:57.920
[Guest]: has been an issue which has caught on for a lot of RNSs either in support of migration

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:04.400
[Guest]: or in opposition to the migration both, right? Maybe this is because in migration is an issue

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:10.320
[Guest]: where identity and cause quickly overlap with each other, right? Because you already have

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:16.640
[Guest]: an existing national identity. So whenever there are say in France, for example, for

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:21.040
[Guest]: the yellow vest protest, which are still going on, one of the issues in the beginning was

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.200
[Guest]: that there is too much migration, right? And the idea was people then quickly see we are

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:31.040
[Guest]: French, we are different, why are these people coming here? So that there is an inherent

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:36.400
[Guest]: identity aspect which already exists and the immediate cause becomes a flow of people coming

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.440
[Guest]: in or a migration flow. So those two potent things already exist and then you add the

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:47.960
[Guest]: scalability aspect to it and you have protests which emerge. On the other side, you also

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:53.000
[Guest]: have the current protests which are going on in India are actually sort of pro, they

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.880
[Guest]: are saying that why are you dividing people who are coming into India as well, right?

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:05.960
[Guest]: So but this migration aspect sort of leads to these RNSs quite quickly.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:09.480
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting that when we talk about RNSs, when we talk about the three things

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.640
[Amit Varma]: you need identity, cause and scalability, scalability is now become something you can

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:17.200
[Amit Varma]: basically take for granted because the internet is there and you can achieve scalability.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:22.000
[Amit Varma]: So it's only you need an intersection of the other two for it to happen. Yeah. And, you

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.200
[Amit Varma]: know, if we may, like when I was reading Tuffnechi's book, Twitter and tag as which I'll link from

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:32.580
[Amit Varma]: the show notes and recommend to everyone. And one I noticed a lot of commonalities between

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:37.040
[Amit Varma]: what is happening in India now and earlier radically network movements like this. But

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.480
[Amit Varma]: what also struck me was that many of those commonalities, many of those features that

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:47.360
[Amit Varma]: they have in common actually led to those movements not being able to achieve what they

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.840
[Amit Varma]: set out to achieve. For example, there is the leaderless aspect of it. Now, it's a good

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:56.800
[Amit Varma]: thing. I think it's a very good thing that you don't have people trying to co-opt leadership

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:03.200
[Amit Varma]: or you know, it's all spontaneous. It's, it's whatever. But that also then leads to what

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:07.920
[Amit Varma]: Tuffnechi calls tactical freeze in the sense that then you cannot change, the movement

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.860
[Amit Varma]: cannot change tactics midway. There is always confusion about that. You cannot really negotiate

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.720
[Amit Varma]: with the government who is negotiating on your behalf. How do you know that person hasn't

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:21.880
[Amit Varma]: been co-opted and there are, you know, when there is a general commitment to a set of

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:28.200
[Amit Varma]: values, it is okay if the specific aims are diffused and dispersed. But when you are actually

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.760
[Amit Varma]: getting to a position of telling the government, okay, give us A, B, C, this is what we want,

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:39.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, that specificity doesn't come around. And on a day to day basis, there is what is

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.440
[Amit Varma]: called an adhocracy, things happen in an ad hoc kind of way. And other movements have

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:48.520
[Amit Varma]: been let down by this. Like if you look at what happened in Egypt, fine, great, they

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:55.120
[Amit Varma]: got rid of Mubarak. But three years later, you know, you had a military dictatorship

00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:00.360
[Amit Varma]: again and you know, a similar kind of mess. They didn't really achieve their ultimate

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:04.320
[Amit Varma]: aims. Maybe they achieved one small proximate aim, but they didn't achieve their ultimate

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:10.560
[Amit Varma]: aims. So looking at that, what can, you know, what lessons can these protests draw from

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:16.100
[Amit Varma]: such protests of the past, which have so much in common with it beyond libraries?

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:22.480
[Guest]: So what we see from the previous movements, the lessons that we learn are, yeah, that

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:27.560
[Guest]: what happens is generally these protests, once they take place, remember the state is

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:33.400
[Guest]: still going to react to this, right? So once the state reacts, it depends on how the protest

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:38.120
[Guest]: will then shape up in reaction to what the state does. So for example, take the Hong

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:43.240
[Guest]: Kong case, okay? So Hong Kong, there has been this radically network protest going on there

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:52.000
[Guest]: for many months now. And the ultimate cause for that was this anti-extradition, the extradition

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:00.040
[Guest]: bill, which probably said that whoever is found guilty of some crimes in Hong Kong,

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:05.520
[Guest]: they'll be tried in China, right? So now this became an immediate cause. The identity was

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:12.360
[Guest]: this Hong Kong versus the China divide already. So this was the main demand, okay? Anti-LAB.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:18.800
[Guest]: But once the state actually accepted that this anti-LAB will not go ahead, the demands

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:24.000
[Guest]: then proliferated. Now there are many more demands and some, one or two of those demands

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.040
[Guest]: will never be accepted by the Chinese state because they are like going right against

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:35.560
[Guest]: what the party state wants. So what if you have these protests which morph into multiple

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:41.560
[Guest]: demands and you're not able to control them, then they won't be successful, right? In at

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:47.500
[Guest]: least achieving them. The second thing is often the states are able to divide these

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:53.040
[Guest]: communities at a later point of time. So classic, right? If you can divide and rule kind of

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.960
[Amit Varma]: strategies. And these communities often divide themselves with their quest for ideological

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:03.880
[Guest]: purity and they're silly in fighting. Exactly. I mean, do you want to be holier than thou?

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:09.000
[Guest]: And then you actually end up reducing that imagined identity you had constructed in the

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.320
[Guest]: first place and you split into multiple RNCs, all of them having their own identity aspect

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:20.240
[Guest]: and cause aspect. So once you split that, then again, you will not be able to achieve

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:29.440
[Guest]: what you want. So those are two, three things that these protests can learn probably. And

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:35.000
[Amit Varma]: also, you know, just sort of taking that diffusion of aim forward, the question that comes up,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.600
[Amit Varma]: for example, with these anti-CAA protests, you know, you could ask what is the final

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:45.960
[Amit Varma]: aim and what all the protesters are fighting is not just that specific Citizenship Amendment

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:52.480
[Amit Varma]: Act, but also that way of thinking that that narrow view of what India means and so on

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:57.080
[Amit Varma]: and so forth. Now, the question there is what is the aim and when do you know that you won?

00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:01.680
[Amit Varma]: Because it's very easy, for example, the government won't do it, but we are recording on Jan 23rd.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:06.120
[Amit Varma]: But if the government were to just come forward and say, okay, we won't do the CAA, fine.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, that doesn't end it because they'll still do the NPR. And you know, the overall

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:14.200
[Amit Varma]: program will continue even if one or two elements don't. When do you call the protests off?

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:18.680
[Amit Varma]: When do you what is the reason for calling the protests off? If the protest is not being

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:23.240
[Amit Varma]: able to achieve his proximate aim, is that reason enough to call it off? Or should you

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:29.360
[Amit Varma]: continue for larger reasons, like all of Gandhi's satyagrahas pretty much failed in their proximate

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:33.960
[Amit Varma]: aims, but they achieved something much larger in terms of mobilizing the people and mobilizing

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.960
[Guest]: the masses?

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:40.520
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely. Like to use Tufekci's framework itself, right? She divides that generally

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:46.240
[Guest]: social movements have sort of three capacities, right? Narrative capacity, that is the aim

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:51.720
[Guest]: of changing the narrative and the stories that people think in terms of. Second is disruptive

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:56.920
[Guest]: capacities. Basically, if you are movements able to stop business as usual. And the third

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.760
[Guest]: one is electoral or institutional capacity, whether you are able to bring about a change

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:06.640
[Guest]: in the head of the state, or are you able to actually change the electoral structure

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:14.720
[Guest]: itself, right? So now, if you look at social movements, aided and abetted by digital media,

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:19.320
[Guest]: what the capacity which is enhanced most is the narrative capacity, right? So you are

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:25.800
[Guest]: able to significantly change narratives very quickly, you can put out a new story there,

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:30.280
[Guest]: that will be consumed by a large amount of people. But the digital products are not so

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:35.040
[Guest]: strong when it comes to the other two ideas, right? So not all digital products have been

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:40.880
[Guest]: able to even do the disruptive aspect. And to get the third one electoral change, that's

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.880
[Guest]: even tougher.

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.480
[Amit Varma]: No, and again, it strikes me and this is again, going back to public choices, right? You know,

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.320
[Amit Varma]: at one point in time in India against corruption, the movement happened, which actually didn't

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:55.120
[Amit Varma]: achieve any objectives, really. But at that point, they decided to do something about

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:59.880
[Amit Varma]: the electoral objective and the Aam Aadmi Party was formed, and there was much dissent

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:04.200
[Amit Varma]: within the movement about that, but fine, they were formed. But the moment that party

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:09.640
[Amit Varma]: was formed, it becomes prey to the incentives of regular politics, where all that matters

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:14.280
[Amit Varma]: is gaining power somehow, and principles cease to matter. So things that they would have

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:20.160
[Amit Varma]: stood up for in the past, for example, they made Vishal Dadlani apologize to the Jain

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.480
[Amit Varma]: Sadhu who felt offended. For example, they actually supported the abolition of 370 in

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.960
[Amit Varma]: Kashmir a few months ago, and they haven't at all spoken out against the CAA and how

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:33.920
[Amit Varma]: it threatens the idea of India. And I don't blame them for this at one level, because

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:38.760
[Amit Varma]: I understand that they have reconfigured themselves as a party of good governance. And they are

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.600
[Amit Varma]: saying we are doing education, we are doing schools, and they're saying it's important

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:46.720
[Amit Varma]: for us to win the election and get the BGP out of there. So we will not stand up for

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:51.280
[Amit Varma]: all of these things. But then what happens, therefore, is that even if a movement even

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:56.760
[Amit Varma]: if a sliver of the movement is to try and gain electoral capacity, they are still subject

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:02.040
[Amit Varma]: to the incentives of politics, which is always to get power to get votes, and to use power

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:06.400
[Amit Varma]: to make money so that people donate to you. And the whole process gets corrupted very

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:10.760
[Amit Varma]: fast, as in my opinion, has happened with our Mandi party, whatever else one may feel

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:16.240
[Amit Varma]: about them. How does one get past this? I mean, you know, are all movements then destined

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.080
[Amit Varma]: to either be corrupt in whatever electoral form they take to be corrupted and to be diluted?

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.400
[Amit Varma]: Or are they destined to just sort of fade away?

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:29.560
[Guest]: Yeah, first of all, I think we need to decide what we mean to call a protest successful,

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:37.240
[Guest]: right? I would say the fact that whatever Aam Aadmi Party, the fact that despite all

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:43.040
[Guest]: the incentives, which are heavily loaded against any new party, the fact that a new formation

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:47.640
[Guest]: has come about because of ISE is itself, you can say it is a success.

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's politically successful. And you can even say that it's successful in terms

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.880
[Amit Varma]: of governance, because they've provided better governance than the alternative would have.

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:59.440
[Guest]: Yeah, but the construction of the alternative itself is a success. I forget about the good

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:04.920
[Guest]: governance that they have done, even if they weren't able to, the fact that a new entity

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:10.160
[Guest]: came up, and it was able to at least win is a change from

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:15.000
[Amit Varma]: But it's almost, it's almost a tangential success, the main aim of the movement, which

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.680
[Amit Varma]: was let's do something about corruption, which first of all, they were articulating wrongly,

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:22.840
[Amit Varma]: because you cannot solve corruption by increasing instead of reducing government, the discretion

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:28.040
[Amit Varma]: of the state and the power given to it. But that hasn't happened, you know, so and not

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.480
[Amit Varma]: come closer to happening either.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:35.160
[Guest]: Yeah, that that is true. But what I'm saying is that there is, so we need to then say what

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:40.560
[Guest]: was the aim of these protests. And the problem there is that these aims will always be so

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:46.720
[Guest]: dispersed or diffused. And as they go on, more things will be added to them. And that's

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.720
[Amit Varma]: why we have this

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.440
[Amit Varma]: And I guess Syriza in Greek was an example of a movement which became a successful political

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.440
[Amit Varma]: thing, right?

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:58.080
[Guest]: Yeah, Syriza, there have been other examples as well. And in Tunisia, also, you were able

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:04.120
[Guest]: to completely change the government, etc. Right. So Tunisia is like one odd success

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:10.440
[Guest]: element. But in many other countries, you actually you reverted back to the normal levels

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:17.720
[Guest]: regression to the mean. So that has happened. But overall, it is not a very positive story

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:23.760
[Guest]: to say like, I can't say that this is the way digital protests have significantly changed.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:29.040
[Guest]: And the research on that also shows that they significantly change narrative capacity, but

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:34.760
[Guest]: disruptive and electoral capacities are much, much difficult to change. Because remember,

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:42.200
[Guest]: you are up against the state. And the state has a very coercive power with it. And when

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:48.440
[Guest]: it comes down heavy handed on the protesters, it becomes very difficult for them to bring

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.440
[Guest]: the change in the other two dimensions.

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.440
[Amit Varma]: No, and if I might speculate, I've, you know, in the last five minutes, I've actually kind

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:58.520
[Amit Varma]: of changed my mind a little bit on that listening to you. Because it strikes me that we need

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:04.320
[Amit Varma]: to figure out how do we define success. And I would say that even if the CIA, the citizen

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.880
[Amit Varma]: the Amendment Act itself remains on the bill, and the government does whatever it does,

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:11.840
[Amit Varma]: and they proceed according to plan, and we haven't been able to disrupt them. Regardless

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:16.440
[Amit Varma]: of that one way in which the movement has been a big success is in changing the culture.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:21.600
[Amit Varma]: So many people now know the preamble, at least by heart, though, I wish it was the Ambedkar

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.800
[Amit Varma]: version and not the Indira Gandhi version of the word socialism part of it. But regardless,

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:29.520
[Amit Varma]: so many people have a greater awareness of constitutional values and the fact that it's

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:33.880
[Amit Varma]: supposed to safeguard individual liberties and act as a check on the state. And so many

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:38.720
[Amit Varma]: more people are now willing to come out in the streets for that augurs well for the future,

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.720
[Guest]: would you say?

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:44.560
[Guest]: Absolutely. So the narrative has shifted, right? And we are conceptualizing what it

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:50.240
[Guest]: means to be an Indian and what is not Indian, what is an Indian in a sense, right. And so

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:56.120
[Guest]: these are important distinctions, which are being made through digital media and elsewhere.

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:59.320
[Guest]: So that is a success, right? Yeah.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:03.200
[Amit Varma]: That is a success. You know, we'll take a quick commercial break now. And after we come

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.680
[Amit Varma]: back from the break, let's now talk about the philosophical and policy questions that

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:13.200
[Amit Varma]: this brings up about the interplay between the state and radically networked societies.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, what the role of the state should be because not all radically networked societies

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.680
[Amit Varma]: are necessarily for the good.

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:26.700
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:32.880
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls? Well, worry no more. Head on over to IndianColors.com.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:37.400
[Amit Varma]: Indian Colors is a company that licenses images of the finest modern art from some of the

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:42.680
[Amit Varma]: best artists in India and adapts them into products of everyday use. These include wearable

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:48.040
[Amit Varma]: art like stoles and dresses for women and evening shirts for men. Home decor like wall

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:52.840
[Amit Varma]: plates, cushion covers and table linen and accessories like tote bags and pencil pouches.

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:58.120
[Amit Varma]: This allows art lovers to actually get fine art into their homes at an accessible price

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:04.040
[Amit Varma]: and artists get royalties on sales just like authors do. Their artists include luminaries

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:09.240
[Amit Varma]: like Dhruvi Acharya, Jaideep Mehrotra, Madhuri Kathe, Sameer Mondal, Brinda Miller, Tanmay

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:14.360
[Amit Varma]: Samanta, TM Aziz and Manisha Gehra Baswani. They accept bulk orders for corporate and

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:18.600
[Amit Varma]: festival gifting. But even if you want to buy just for yourself or a friend, head on

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.760
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen. I'm chatting with Pranay Koteswani about radically

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:41.720
[Amit Varma]: network societies. And one of the things I forgot to mention in the first half of the

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:48.080
[Amit Varma]: show before the break was I wanted to ask Pranay specifically about the Hong Kong protest

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:51.320
[Amit Varma]: because he's actually written and thought about it a fair bit. Go ahead.

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:57.400
[Guest]: Yeah, so Hong Kong is actually an RNS which is still going on, okay, as even as we speak,

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:01.760
[Guest]: and it's sustained over many, many months. So it's an interesting case study. I just

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:07.480
[Guest]: wanted to bring out a few elements of how digital media has a role to play in those

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:13.520
[Guest]: protests. Okay, so the overall phrase that I use for this is the Hong Kong movement has

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:20.600
[Guest]: been about moving your information trail offline, while moving your decision making and narrative

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:26.400
[Guest]: online. Okay, so that is how I put it together. So what does it mean? Okay, so moving your

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:33.320
[Guest]: information trail offline. Now remember, everyone knows the surveillance power and authority

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:38.600
[Guest]: of the Chinese state that they use, right? So that's why the Hong Kong protesters have

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:44.040
[Guest]: been trying to move their information trail offline. So they use a lot of cash, they don't

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:49.360
[Guest]: so they are actually intentionally moving off the internet on for some purposes, right?

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:53.920
[Guest]: So using cash, not using ATMs, because then you will be able to track people, they are

00:54:53.920 --> 00:55:00.040
[Guest]: turning off FaceTime ID or touch ID on their phones, because they again feel that people

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:07.920
[Guest]: might use it. In many times, they have been using airdrop and Bluetooth file sharing in

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.800
[Guest]: protest venues instead of the internet, because again, they fear that they can be tracked.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:17.520
[Guest]: So that is interesting. The second part of it was to move decision making actually online.

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:23.640
[Guest]: So just look at Desirvo's report in BBC that some of the groups on Telegram, etc, have

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:30.400
[Guest]: around 70,000 active subscribers, okay? And that represents 1% of Hong Kong's entire population.

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:35.280
[Guest]: It's quite significant, right? And they also have specific groups for specific purposes.

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:40.600
[Guest]: So there are groups for taking decisions. So they did like an online referendum of sorts,

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:45.560
[Guest]: right? So whether we should continue protest the next day or not, that was voted on some

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:51.680
[Guest]: of these groups with large memberships, right? Also, there were other groups which were more

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:56.280
[Guest]: purpose oriented. So there were groups for medics, groups for supplying food when these

00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:02.480
[Guest]: protests were happening. So you know, you see entire decision making and the organization

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:08.400
[Guest]: of this protest also moving online, okay? And the tools used were Telegram, Signal,

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:15.160
[Guest]: which they thought was less under control of the Chinese state. So this is very fascinating,

00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:22.520
[Guest]: right? So digital media enabling the construction and the continuance of a protest is seen in

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.200
[Amit Varma]: Hong Kong quite clearly.

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:28.600
[Amit Varma]: And this is really interesting, because I'm specifically interested by Hong Kong as you

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:33.160
[Amit Varma]: know, because the technology and the ways of communication there are evolving so quickly

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:37.360
[Amit Varma]: that in some cases to get away from the Chinese government, they have to do what one could

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:42.280
[Amit Varma]: term radical denetworking, yeah, and just kind of get off the internet. And it also

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:47.240
[Amit Varma]: reminds me of a time where, you know, it isn't as if, you know, a technology may be built

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:53.940
[Amit Varma]: to share cute cat pictures. But within that, users themselves build features, which can

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:58.760
[Amit Varma]: be used for radical networking, for example, the hashtag, right, the hashtag is really

00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:03.720
[Amit Varma]: something that users innovated with first, and then they became a thing. And now you

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:10.240
[Amit Varma]: can identify trends by it, and so on and so forth. And this kind of a bit of that happening

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:16.680
[Amit Varma]: in Hong Kong. And do you think India will also sort of over here as well, we'll go in

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:21.840
[Amit Varma]: some of those directions as the imperatives to keep protests going get stronger?

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:27.320
[Guest]: Yeah. So one interesting thing about the protests that are that have happened over the last

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:31.200
[Guest]: years are they have been prolonged in many of the countries. Some protests have been

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:36.720
[Guest]: going on for more than a year as well. So it might play out that way. But that depends

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:41.680
[Guest]: on the other aspect that we are going to talk about how the state will react. Just one point

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:45.800
[Guest]: here about the Hong Kong protests to talk about the weak points of this, you know, one

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:52.360
[Guest]: thing, again, this BBC report, which excellently captured all this said that these groups which

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:57.320
[Guest]: were used to do a referenda type of decision making. So a lot of people said that whenever

00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:02.200
[Guest]: there is a black and white decision to be made, these groups really work well. But when

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:08.600
[Guest]: there is a nuanced position to take, then these groups don't work as well as they would,

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:14.600
[Guest]: we would want them to write. So that is something which we'll experience in other protests also

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.600
[Guest]: through these tools.

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:20.480
[Amit Varma]: Exactly. So let's let's kind of talk about the state. But before we bring the state in,

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:24.560
[Amit Varma]: let's also you know, we've been talking about all of these protests, and many of these are

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:30.240
[Amit Varma]: liberal protests, which you and I are sympathetic towards. But let's also acknowledge that one

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:34.680
[Amit Varma]: radical network societies can be value neutral, you can, you know, use the scalability of

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:40.040
[Amit Varma]: the internet to actually organize pogroms or genocides or has in fact happened lynchings

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:44.360
[Amit Varma]: and so on. And, you know, before Mohammed the clock was killed, for example, there were

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:48.560
[Amit Varma]: photos on WhatsApp, which had these narratives about, you know, perpetually showing pictures

00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:53.320
[Amit Varma]: of meat in his fridge and all of that nonsense. And we've had a problem in India, which I

00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:57.680
[Amit Varma]: discussed at length with Pratik Sinha last year, when I did an episode on fake news with

00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:03.280
[Amit Varma]: him about this mysterious sort of these rumors, which keep propagating across WhatsApp with

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:07.920
[Amit Varma]: details change from locality to locality about how outsiders are coming in and kidnapping

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:13.720
[Amit Varma]: kids, which led to a lot of alarmist lynchings that you saw an outsider in a strange car

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:18.840
[Amit Varma]: and you assume that he must be one of those kid kidnappers and leave aside the motive

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:23.560
[Amit Varma]: behind such rumors being spread as irrelevant. But I think it's clear that in cases like

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:29.720
[Amit Varma]: that, the state needs to sort of step in and do something. And this is probably a good

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:34.720
[Amit Varma]: time to sort of examine the role of the state and its duty vis-a-vis citizens as well, which

00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:37.000
[Guest]: is something you discussed in your paper with Nitin.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:43.480
[Guest]: Yeah. So, let's look at this. So, fundamentally, we are seeing a clash between hierarchically

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:47.800
[Guest]: structured states and radically networked societies, right? So, this is a fundamental

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:53.540
[Guest]: clash. The problem, as we discussed, is information flows in these network communities will all

00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:58.720
[Guest]: always be faster than the decision making cycle and information flows in the state where

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:04.160
[Guest]: it has to go from bottom to up, decision gets made, gets filtered to bottom, right? That's

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.800
[Amit Varma]: going to take a lot of time.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:10.400
[Amit Varma]: And I think the way you guys put it was that states are relics of the industrial age and

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.000
[Amit Varma]: are radically networked societies are products of the information age.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.160
[Guest]: Exactly. So, there's a fundamental mismatch, right? So, states realize that. Now, what

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:23.200
[Guest]: will be the state's reaction when they realize that, you know, things are happening too fast

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:28.680
[Guest]: for us, it's getting out of hand. What states do what they do best, that is excessive use

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:35.600
[Guest]: of force is one response that we see across these protests, right? Whether in Chile or

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:40.680
[Guest]: in Lebanon and even in India now, right? So, you will see the excessive use of force for

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:48.200
[Guest]: this mismatch. So, the state will use law and order machinery to attack the protesters

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:53.240
[Guest]: and say that that is the only way we were left to clamp down these protests, okay? So, that

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.400
[Guest]: is one sort of response that comes up.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:02.200
[Guest]: The second kind of response is, let's take the other extreme. What is a more enlightened

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:08.400
[Guest]: type of response that you would want the state to have? One way would be for the government

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.280
[Guest]: to have better emergency communication systems to at least refute misinformation which might

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:19.520
[Guest]: have happened, right? So, for example, I have an example of this. So, a few years back,

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:25.720
[Guest]: there was a bomb at Church Street, you know, which went off and the rumors started spreading

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:31.520
[Guest]: on that also very quickly about first it was bomb on Church Street, then the next tweets

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.640
[Guest]: came started coming that bomb near a church. And then third, there were also tweets a bomb

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.120
[Guest]: in a church. I mean, completely untrue, but this misinformation was trying to take it

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.920
[Guest]: in a certain direction, probably make it a communal thing of sort, right? But it was

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.920
[Guest]: quickly clamped down because you had a very credible presence of the Bangalore police

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:56.960
[Guest]: online, not just Bangalore police, but the commissioner of police had a very visible

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:03.560
[Guest]: presence and a reputation on that platform that he'd built over time. So, he was quickly

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:07.720
[Guest]: able to come into the picture and say, hey, that's not wrong. It has happened at such

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:13.400
[Guest]: and such place, we are looking at the incident and trying to take note of it, right? So,

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:21.120
[Guest]: that actually ended some of these speculations and which might have led to, you know, more

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:28.620
[Guest]: nastier things from happening. So, if the governments are also embedded in these networks,

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:34.280
[Guest]: they understand it better and they have emergency communication systems in place on how to tackle

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:39.360
[Guest]: these. We might have a more liberal response, at least to one aspect of it, which is misinformation.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:46.160
[Guest]: Okay. So, that's the second way to deal with it. Okay. Third part of it is increased surveillance

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:50.720
[Guest]: is what many states are moving towards. So, they are saying that the only way to do this

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:58.280
[Guest]: is we need to have control over the encryption keys that WhatsApp users or other platforms

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:03.400
[Guest]: use in order to get control of this. Again, quite illiberal response, but this is what

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:08.320
[Guest]: the states are looking at. The fourth one is where governments are saying we will put

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:12.320
[Guest]: constraints even before this type of information is shared. And that is what you have this

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:17.620
[Guest]: 66A of the IT Act kind of response, where the government is saying, if you share any

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:23.920
[Guest]: information which is broadly defined as offensive or of menacing character, we will have some

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:31.520
[Guest]: penalties, etc. You might be put in jail and all that. So, this is another kind of illiberal

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:39.800
[Guest]: response which exists. So, now what you see overall is the state realizes or sees or perceives

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:47.320
[Guest]: this as a fundamental threat to them. And they are being responding with largely illiberal

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:54.800
[Guest]: responses, which exists as either preconditions on what can be shared, or you have increased

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:59.880
[Guest]: surveillance, or you have increased use of force. All three quite negative. And on the

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:04.760
[Guest]: other hand, you have a more liberal response of having better emergency communication systems.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.280
[Guest]: And largely, states are still opting for the illiberal responses across the world. And

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.280
[Guest]: we are moving towards that. Even in India, the narrative is now, the fact that we see

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.560
[Guest]: WhatsApp enabling this is a very easy excuse for the state to actually say, yeah, the problem

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.800
[Guest]: is not us, the problem is actually WhatsApp. So, give us the encryption keys, we will be

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.360
[Guest]: able to regulate this better.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.280
[Amit Varma]: No, and also states have a monopoly on violence, which they are used to. So, the instinctive

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:36.480
[Amit Varma]: response is to react with a sort of violence. And like you, I feel the only one of these

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.280
[Amit Varma]: four responses which you laid out, which I completely agree with and is the right response

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.920
[Amit Varma]: is that the government itself establish a credible presence across networks, so it can

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:50.760
[Amit Varma]: stop misinformation from spreading. There's a larger question here. And the larger debate

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:56.360
[Amit Varma]: here, which you've written about for years as well, is the tussle between say, liberty

01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:01.160
[Amit Varma]: and security. And to sort of give a little bit of very quick context for the listeners

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:06.600
[Amit Varma]: on why this is an age old tussle, or at least a tussle since enlightenment value shaped

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:12.280
[Amit Varma]: the state is that the whole purpose of the state as liberals like me and Pranay would

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:18.320
[Amit Varma]: view it is to defend our individual rights. But there is a trade off here that if we want

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:23.160
[Amit Varma]: our freedoms to be safeguarded by the state, we have to give away some rights to enable

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:28.120
[Amit Varma]: the state to do this. So, we give the state the right to have a monopoly on violence.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:32.840
[Amit Varma]: And of course, the existence of the state is based on our taxes. So, you know, we accept

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:38.040
[Amit Varma]: that there will be some coercion and therefore some infringement on our rights on our liberties

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:45.400
[Amit Varma]: for the state to exist. So, we give away a little bit of our liberty for the amount of

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:51.520
[Amit Varma]: security that we want. And this equation is different across the world. Like you've pointed

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:56.040
[Amit Varma]: out in your paper in the US, they might give away 10% of liberty for whatever and in other

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:00.680
[Amit Varma]: places you give away far more liberty like in North Korea, for example. And this is a

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:05.600
[Amit Varma]: tussle that also comes up in the context of radically networked societies, because many

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:10.760
[Amit Varma]: of these measures that you spoke about, like the surveillance state, there is no state

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:15.760
[Amit Varma]: capacity to actually surveil everyone, but like the surveillance state or like just getting

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:22.640
[Amit Varma]: into a protest and beating up protesters and so on, you know, go towards the side of infringing

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:28.920
[Amit Varma]: liberties too much for protecting and imagined security. So, how has thinking on this evolved

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:34.120
[Guest]: in this context? Yeah. So, I think there are some positive

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:39.240
[Guest]: things to it. So, this is a liberty security trade-off that we spoke about, right? What

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:43.960
[Guest]: percentage of rights that you give to the state in order to experience security and

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:50.360
[Guest]: that trade-off varies across different nation states. Now, what you would see in the past

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:58.200
[Guest]: is when this RNS emerged first, the immediate response was taking the argument of in favor

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:04.320
[Guest]: of security just prevents liberty and all sorts. So, the classic response was stop the

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:10.000
[Guest]: internet and India is the internet shutdown capital, right? So, that is one more response

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.680
[Guest]: that they have used. Which doesn't work as you pointed out.

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:18.520
[Guest]: Yeah, it doesn't work because these networks are very resilient. So, even after you break

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.400
[Guest]: down the internet, there will be other ways that people, once that identity and cause

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:27.560
[Guest]: has been established, people will find other means to it, right? Like in Hong Kong's case,

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:32.760
[Guest]: people use Bluetooth file sharing or AirDrop to share documents. In other places, people

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:39.720
[Guest]: can use satellite phones or other ways to basically keep the network going on. So, that

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:44.960
[Guest]: was what the state started with, that response of shutting down the internet. But now states

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:50.200
[Guest]: realize, at least some of them, that maybe that is not the way to go forward and that's

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:56.000
[Guest]: where they are exploring other means, either in terms of, let's say, surveillance, which

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.440
[Guest]: is problematic for us, but states are exploring that, and the emergency communication system

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:08.360
[Guest]: as well. So, these are what states are realizing. But again, it varies across states. So, in

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:13.000
[Guest]: India, I think we would still say we are in the midst of this policy debate where all

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.760
[Guest]: these options are currently open, right? Internet is still being closed down in many places.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:24.480
[Guest]: Even as we speak in Kashmir, it is still down and the state is also exploring this NAT grid

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:28.080
[Guest]: that has been there for a long time, that we should have a national grid. There have

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:33.400
[Guest]: been talks about your WhatsApp login should be linked to your Aadhaar kind of things as

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:39.000
[Guest]: well, right? So, all this, we are in the midst of that policy debate and it will be interesting

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.040
[Guest]: to see where it actually takes us.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:46.480
[Amit Varma]: No, and also my question to you is, around what axis does one think about this in terms

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:52.720
[Amit Varma]: of instrumentality or morality? For example, you know, Sunil Abraham pointed out that there's

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:57.760
[Amit Varma]: a false dichotomy between privacy and security. And I'll quote him where he says, quote, an

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:03.040
[Amit Varma]: optimization approach to resolving the false dichotomy between privacy and security will

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:07.520
[Amit Varma]: not allow for a total surveillance regime as pursued by the US administration, stop

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:12.240
[Amit Varma]: quote. And his point is that there is like a hockey stick curve, that there is a point

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:16.840
[Amit Varma]: at which is optimal, where you take away some liberties, but you provide a certain amount

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:21.720
[Amit Varma]: of security. And that's where you should stop. The analogy he uses is like salt in cooking,

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:26.200
[Amit Varma]: that you know, food without salt is tasteless. But beyond the point, if you put too much

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:30.760
[Amit Varma]: salt, it is also tasteless. So, you have to get the amount right. And this is an approach

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:35.680
[Amit Varma]: which would look at it in instrumental terms, that we are trying to provide this much security

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:40.680
[Amit Varma]: and therefore, we take away this many liberties and it becomes almost an engineering problem,

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.520
[Amit Varma]: as it were. But the other approach would be to also take into account the moral aspect

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:49.840
[Amit Varma]: of it and say that, no, I don't care what the instrumentalities are. Beyond the point,

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.240
[Amit Varma]: you cannot take away my liberties.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:56.520
[Guest]: Yeah, I think, I think both of us fall on the other side of the moral argument, right?

01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:03.840
[Guest]: You would want the state to have as little a role in restricting liberties, as it already

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:09.320
[Guest]: restricts our liberties in many, many areas. Yeah, so you don't want another additional

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:16.280
[Guest]: tool in the hands of the state. So, we are wary of that. And that's why there are other

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:21.320
[Guest]: responses, right? But the thing is, you need to have state capacity to be able to execute

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:27.240
[Guest]: any of those, right? Let's say you want excellent emergency communication systems or ways for

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:34.360
[Guest]: states. Let's say, if there is actually a real case of a riot happening because of these

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:41.560
[Guest]: information systems, it is reported. Can states probably consider, in a very localized way,

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:47.320
[Guest]: probably slowing down the scale of this spreading of this information, either through appearance

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:52.720
[Guest]: of credible information on WhatsApp, or even say, let's say, considering slowing down the

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:57.800
[Guest]: internet in a very localized area. Again, it is, there is a problem of illiberal thing

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.440
[Guest]: that we are approaching. But as a moral point, you don't want, definitely, internet shutdowns

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:08.680
[Guest]: are not the way to go, right? It is a severe restriction of liberty of a large number of

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:14.640
[Guest]: people in the name of security. And because of a few rioters, you are going to affect

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.440
[Guest]: a lot of other people as well. Or many of these responses, actually, which we talked

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:26.320
[Guest]: about, are, violate that moral stand that we come from, right? And, yeah.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And I mean, I'm just thinking of the counter arguments. For example, I'm against

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:36.040
[Amit Varma]: torture. But one counter thought experiment that is often made up, which is often presented

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.400
[Amit Varma]: to me by people arguing the other side, is that what if there's a nuclear bomb in the

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.800
[Amit Varma]: middle of Bombay, and you know, it's about to go off and one person has a code and you

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:48.160
[Amit Varma]: know, he has a code, but he's not giving it away, should you torture him? And that, you

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:52.160
[Amit Varma]: know, it's again instrumentality versus morality, but then it seems a no brainer that you have

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.920
[Amit Varma]: to save the lives of so many people. So what do you do? And a similar argument could be,

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:59.960
[Amit Varma]: the government has made similar arguments. It's not a thought experiment in the case

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.240
[Amit Varma]: of Kashmir by saying that we had to shut down the internet, because terrorists will communicate

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:10.800
[Amit Varma]: with each other. And this, of course, is a rubbish argument. But this is a sort of argument

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:16.040
[Amit Varma]: which people are making, where the state also can say that, listen, I accept that the only

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:20.480
[Amit Varma]: job of the state, I'll concede your libertarian point that the only job of the state is to

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:25.760
[Amit Varma]: safeguard you and safeguard your rights, but I need to do this for that. How do such arguments

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.280
[Amit Varma]: play out? How have they played out in India in the policy space?

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:37.280
[Guest]: In the Indian case, I think we already have, there are not many qualms about the state

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:43.840
[Guest]: acquiring more power, unfortunately. So the state has been able to clamp down on freedoms

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.560
[Amit Varma]: more easily. And it's normalized. Most of India doesn't

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.640
[Amit Varma]: give a shit that Kashmir hasn't had internet for almost six months.

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:56.920
[Guest]: Yeah. So that's what the Indian case has been, unfortunately. And that liberty argument which

01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:03.640
[Guest]: we are making is not the one which is very popular currently, right? So, yeah, that's

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.640
[Amit Varma]: where we are.

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:09.240
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, before we go, I'm, you know, just thinking back for a moment beyond radically

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:15.280
[Amit Varma]: network societies into radical networking, per se, like, just as a lot of these liberal

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:20.280
[Amit Varma]: movements have been enabled by technology. I mean, I often say that, even as states grow

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.560
[Amit Varma]: stronger and stronger, the best libertarian hope is that technology will empower individuals,

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.240
[Amit Varma]: which also seems to be happening. But it's equally true if you look at it another way

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.200
[Amit Varma]: that a lot of these right-wing populist movements that have come up have also been enabled by

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.160
[Amit Varma]: technology in the sense, and this is something I've written about, and we've spoken about

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:43.680
[Amit Varma]: in the past on how, what social media perhaps did was that it created preference cascades

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.560
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that, and these are the words of Timur Koran, he talks about how people

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.360
[Amit Varma]: typically carry out preference falsification, that they don't express what they really feel

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:56.840
[Amit Varma]: about something because they're not sure if there are others like them. For example, Soviet

01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:01.320
[Amit Varma]: dissidents under the Soviet Union who did not know that if they felt anger at the regime,

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.080
[Amit Varma]: they would not say it because they didn't know there were others like them. But then

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.160
[Amit Varma]: a moment comes when you realize that everybody shares, there are enough people and you have

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:13.040
[Amit Varma]: what is called a preference cascade. And Glenn Reynolds, a kind stuff under the old school

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:18.520
[Amit Varma]: blogger once wrote a piece about how Trump's rise, according to him, was enabled by preference

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:24.240
[Amit Varma]: cascades because suddenly a lot of people realized that the thoughts that they were

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.440
[Amit Varma]: otherwise wary of expressing because it didn't seem politically correct, were actually shared

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:33.760
[Amit Varma]: by a lot of people. And this coming together of silent majorities, you know, enabled Trump

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.840
[Amit Varma]: to come to power. And in a similar sense, it could be argued that the rise of Modi to

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:46.440
[Amit Varma]: some extent was enabled by this, where a lot of people, you know, in some cases, perhaps,

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:50.640
[Amit Varma]: where a lot of people suddenly realized that everybody shares, whatever it is that draws

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.240
[Amit Varma]: them to Modi's vision of India, maybe the desire for a Hindu Rashtra or a hatred of

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:59.160
[Amit Varma]: Muslims or bigotry or sexism or whatever. And I'm sure there are positive things also,

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:04.400
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to indicate that everybody who voted or votes for Modi is necessarily falls

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:08.880
[Amit Varma]: into one of these categories. Though at the moment, I can't imagine too many positive

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.200
[Amit Varma]: categories of voting for him. And all of this has also been enabled by social media. So

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:19.240
[Amit Varma]: there are these countervailing things, processes sort of happening within society. And at the

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.960
[Amit Varma]: same time, the coercive power of the state has also been enabled by technology, like

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:30.000
[Amit Varma]: I retweeted something someone pointed out a few days ago, about how a lot of people

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.320
[Amit Varma]: who were near a protest somewhere in Kerala, I think, were got noticed, got show cause

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.680
[Amit Varma]: notices from the government that what were you doing there? And how did the government

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.640
[Amit Varma]: know they were there because their cell phone signals are picked up by the cell phone tower,

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:47.000
[Amit Varma]: something of that sort. And the government, of course, has like incredibly scary surveillance

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.720
[Amit Varma]: technologies, that they might even be listening to this podcast at the time of recording and

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:58.360
[Amit Varma]: not at the time of release. Hello, bureaucrat, if you're listening. So looking ahead into

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:03.400
[Amit Varma]: the future, where technology is both a cause for hope and despair, what is sort of a worst

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:07.840
[Amit Varma]: case scenario 10 years down the line and a best case scenario 10 years down the line?

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:16.080
[Guest]: So, the best case scenario, I would say would be where these imagined communities which

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:21.200
[Guest]: are there, might be they are able to create new communities, new imagined identities,

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:28.080
[Guest]: which didn't exist earlier, on the lines which sort of are more humane towards each other,

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:34.000
[Guest]: which see each other as an individual rather than as a part of a specific background, right?

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:41.160
[Guest]: So, their caste, colour, religion, but just seeing it as we are all humans. So, just because

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.400
[Guest]: of that, we need to move more sympathetic to each other. If that happens, and we are

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:51.120
[Guest]: able to form new imagined identities on those lines, maybe the world will move towards the

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:56.800
[Guest]: world. It's a very philosophical thing, but I don't have a concrete answer to say. The

01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:02.680
[Guest]: second one on that would be the negative part would be, yeah, these identities actually

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:08.360
[Guest]: reaffirm our existing biases. And there are new RNSs which happened on already existing

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:14.640
[Guest]: caste, class lines. So, that again leads to a lot of problems. Look at the cause angle,

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:19.880
[Guest]: you know, and as we discussed about how consumer protests are being taken, a negative scenario

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:25.480
[Guest]: also is maybe now increasing prices of anything or decreasing subsidies of anything will become

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:31.000
[Guest]: difficult, because there might be radically network mobilizations in opposition to these.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:37.320
[Amit Varma]: In fact, TikTok for a while had like 356 million views for some hashtag which had onions in

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:43.040
[Amit Varma]: it, which and there were 1000s of videos protesting the price rise of onions, which was radically

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:46.320
[Amit Varma]: networked entertainment, but not exactly a movement.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.840
[Guest]: Yeah, and so that's a problem, right? So, because you already have these strong endowment

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:56.200
[Guest]: effects, especially in India on everything, right? We get so much tax benefit. So, we

01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:01.640
[Guest]: are that endowment effect is there. And if the government wants to end these, imagine

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:06.360
[Guest]: there is a radically network mobilization, which takes this as an immediate cause the

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:13.400
[Guest]: identity aspect might be built in over years, but it will become even more difficult for

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:18.160
[Guest]: these subsidies to be taken out as well. So, that's a sort of a negative scenario.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:22.240
[Amit Varma]: And I guess it might be an element of populism as well. For example, one legitimate cause

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:26.520
[Amit Varma]: which everyone should protest is a rising unemployment in India and the jobs crisis.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:31.880
[Amit Varma]: But one unproductive way of protesting it is when groups like the party that's for example,

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.920
[Amit Varma]: come together and just ask for more government reservations for themselves, which does nothing

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:40.880
[Amit Varma]: to solve the structural reasons for the problem. But, you know, the structural reasons of the

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.160
[Amit Varma]: problem are so sort of abstract and counterintuitive that they're not going to get you're not going

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.880
[Amit Varma]: to mobilize masses around those things. So, you have the right cause, but a movement that

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.440
[Amit Varma]: demands perhaps the wrong action or action which doesn't really solve the problem. And

01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:00.680
[Amit Varma]: you can have more localized RNSs around these.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:06.720
[Guest]: One more, we can look at sort of a negative aspect of it is the look at the role of the

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:11.360
[Guest]: elected representative, that also fundamentally changes in the sense that, you know, there

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:16.600
[Guest]: has been an age old debate about what is the role of the elected representative? Is he

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:22.920
[Guest]: an ambassador for whatever the constituents think or he or she can apply their mind to

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:28.600
[Guest]: a particular policy problem, right? There's Edmund Burke's famous speech to the electors

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:34.360
[Guest]: of Bristol. It talks about all these, right? So now imagine how will that play out when

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:40.760
[Guest]: everyone is radically networked. It becomes difficult for a person to take a position

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:47.360
[Guest]: against the stream of opinion which already exists. So imagine already, people have hardened

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:52.760
[Guest]: their opinions and stance through a radically networked community mobilized on that. Will

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:59.440
[Guest]: that representative can they afford to take a position against this becomes slightly difficult.

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:03.400
[Amit Varma]: And it also might lead to something of a status quo bias in the sense you're scared of doing

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:08.720
[Amit Varma]: anything at all. Because doing anything at all raises a risk for you from a radically

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:13.840
[Amit Varma]: networked and very polarized populace. So you just try to sort of stay invisible and

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:14.840
[Guest]: stay out of trouble.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:21.000
[Guest]: Let's end on a positive note. There might be some imagined identities which are formed

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:28.200
[Guest]: across the barriers of our nation state across the barriers of our immediate communities,

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:33.920
[Guest]: right, which are there. So therein lies the hope that these new communities will be able

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:39.520
[Guest]: to transcend some of the already existing fault lines. And they will push the agenda

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:45.400
[Guest]: of the government in a direction which is beneficial for both sides across that.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:48.600
[Amit Varma]: And who knows this community could be listeners of the seen and the unseen. We can call them

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:53.480
[Amit Varma]: unseeners. Pranay, thank you so much for coming on the show again.
