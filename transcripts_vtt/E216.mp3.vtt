00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.160
[Amit Varma]: The philosopher Thomas Nagel once wrote an essay called What is it like to be a bat?

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.760
[Amit Varma]: The essay deals with the nature of consciousness, its deep and nuanced and influential and controversial.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.840
[Amit Varma]: And my takeaway from it, when I first read it as a kid, was that no matter how much knowledge

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.720
[Amit Varma]: we gather, we cannot really know what it is like to be a bat.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.280
[Amit Varma]: Bats navigate the world through something called echolocation. In other words, they

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.000
[Amit Varma]: use sound to see. Now, we can understand this at an intellectual level, using the laws of

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.800
[Amit Varma]: physics and so on, but we can't actually get inside the head of a bat. And why only look

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.180
[Amit Varma]: at other species? I would argue that despite being wired for empathy, it is hard for any

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.840
[Amit Varma]: one human to know what it is to be someone else. For example, I'm a man. And no matter

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.160
[Amit Varma]: how much knowledge or empathy I have, I can't truly know what it is like to be a woman.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.840
[Amit Varma]: To carry that extra layer of awareness every time I enter a lift, or walk on the street

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.000
[Amit Varma]: at night, or just sense someone's inclusive gaze on me. Those extra layers would shape

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.120
[Amit Varma]: everything else about me till I wouldn't be me. And that's the whole point.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.560
[Amit Varma]: And this is not just across gender. One of my favourite novelists, Georges Simenon, once

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.560
[Amit Varma]: said that the biggest tragedy in the world was that communication, complete communication

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.840
[Amit Varma]: is impossible between any two people in this world. Maybe we can never truly know other

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.640
[Amit Varma]: people who remain characters in the grand play in our head. Maybe we can never even

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.240
[Amit Varma]: know ourselves, because we are wired to be self delusional. But before I go too far down

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.880
[Amit Varma]: that road, let me come to the question that sparked my desire to record this episode.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.240
[Amit Varma]: For someone born a Hindu in India, is it possible to truly know what it is like to be born a

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.240
[Amit Varma]: Muslim?

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:59.280
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.960
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.240
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen. My guest today is Ghazala Wahab, author of the book

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.280
[Amit Varma]: Born a Muslim, Some Truths about Islam in India. I love this book, learned a lot from

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.840
[Amit Varma]: it, and I recommend all of you read it as well. This book contains multitudes. It is

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.840
[Amit Varma]: both personal memoir, as well as a scholarly history of Islam in India through the centuries.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.320
[Amit Varma]: It covers the different routes Islam took through India, from trade and travel to conquest.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.920
[Amit Varma]: It covers the different influences within Islam, from the Arabic to the Persian. It

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.440
[Amit Varma]: looks at the harmonising influence of the Sufis, as well as the polarising effect of

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.800
[Amit Varma]: the radical sects that later emerged, inspired by Wahhabism. It shows us how a series of

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.100
[Amit Varma]: events drove Muslims in India away from the mainstream, and how their politics was often

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.600
[Amit Varma]: so disconnected from their social reality. Most of all, it shows us the insecurity that

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.520
[Amit Varma]: Muslims feel in India today, and the vicious circle of mistrust and animosity that we seem

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.080
[Amit Varma]: to be trapped within.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.600
[Amit Varma]: But there is also much in this book to take hope from. This conversation covers a lot

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.160
[Amit Varma]: of ground, and the first 90 minutes or so, until the break, are about Gazala's personal

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.960
[Amit Varma]: journey, in a sense mimicking the structure of the book. I always begin my episodes by

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.040
[Amit Varma]: chatting about my guest's life so far, and I find it as fascinating as whatever subject

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.360
[Amit Varma]: we may be discussing. I may never know what it is like to be a bat, but it's a lovely

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.680
[Amit Varma]: feeling to get a sense of how someone else has been shaped. If I could say to everyone

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.720
[Amit Varma]: I met, let me walk for a moment in your shoes, and if they let me do that, I would be so

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.200
[Amit Varma]: lucky. So I always love this first portion, but if you want to get to the part of the

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.840
[Amit Varma]: show where we talk about the history of Islam, well then that begins after the first break

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.000
[Amit Varma]: at around the 90 minute mark. But hey, just listen to the full thing. Before that though,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.240
[Amit Varma]: let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.280
[Amit Varma]: One of the great tragedies of my life is that I had such bad math teachers in school. For

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.120
[Amit Varma]: that reason, I never got turned on to math till I was an adult and fell in love with

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.000
[Amit Varma]: it while writing about economics and playing poker for a living. But oh my god, math is

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.520
[Amit Varma]: so much fun. That's why I have an online course to recommend to you. Head on over to

[Amit Varma]: Gazala, hi, welcome to The Seen and The Unseen. Thank you so much. Such a pleasure being here.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.160
[Amit Varma]: I loved reading your book, Born a Muslim. And, you know, one of the sort of things I

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.320
[Amit Varma]: really liked about it is how it's such an organic mix of the personal and the socio

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.480
[Amit Varma]: political that, you know, through the story of your own life, in a sense, and your experiences,

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.680
[Amit Varma]: you're also tracing the history of Islam in India, how it's kind of evolved through the

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.720
[Amit Varma]: decades and, you know, what it's like to be Muslim in India today, all of which taught

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.480
[Amit Varma]: me a lot. But we'll, let's begin this as you begin your book, you begin your book with

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.120
[Amit Varma]: this wonderful introduction, which to me was worth the price of the book alone, which is

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.960
[Amit Varma]: like this long personal essay, which talks about your growing up years and all of that.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.680
[Amit Varma]: But you know, even before that, tell me a little bit about the young Gazala as a kid,

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, where did you grow up? What kind of person were you? And what were your early

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.880
[Amit Varma]: influences? What would you read? Fill me into some of that.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:29.600
[Guest]: I grew up in a small Muslim dominated mahala of Agra. We were a large family living in

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:36.360
[Guest]: a very small house. So there were always too many people and too few rooms. And we had

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.080
[Guest]: to share rooms. So it was understood that girls would be sharing the rooms with their

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.920
[Guest]: aunts and boys would be sharing with their uncles. And there was never enough space for

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:58.280
[Guest]: the kids to play. Since, and it was a joint family, my grandfather had 11 kids, six sons

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:05.680
[Guest]: and actually seven sons and four daughters, one of his sons died early. So and I grew

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.160
[Guest]: up with a lot of cousins at home. And we were not allowed to step out of the house because

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:21.120
[Guest]: both my grandfather and my father and his younger siblings felt that they wanted to

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.280
[Guest]: give us a different kind of life as opposed to our neighborhood. Our neighborhood was

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:38.280
[Guest]: largely low middle class. And most of the people were employed in some sort of a family

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:45.200
[Guest]: low level business. So a lot of people were underemployed because all of them were doing

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.720
[Guest]: the same thing. So the kids also didn't go to the best of schools, a lot of kids didn't

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:58.120
[Guest]: go to school. So my family, an extended family, they wanted something different for their

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:06.880
[Guest]: children. We all went to English medium school, I went to a convent school. So to prevent

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.520
[Guest]: us from stepping out of the house unescorted or to mingle with the other kids, we used

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.120
[Guest]: to be told very fanciful stories about if we go out, somebody would be sitting there

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.680
[Guest]: and he'll be kidnapped or somebody would do some sort of a black magic and we turn into

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:32.400
[Guest]: something else. So that lane outside the house was always full of dangerous possibilities.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:40.920
[Guest]: And I was not a very brave child. So I was happy staying inside. So we, for us, our play

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:47.560
[Guest]: area used to be the rooftop where we would spend most of our time. But because I was

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:54.560
[Guest]: not a very athletic child, I had, I was prone to falling very often and hurting myself,

00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:02.480
[Guest]: especially my ankles. So I was not heavily into a lot of physical games that my other

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:10.240
[Guest]: cousins would play. And I got more interested because we didn't have any technology, no

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:20.560
[Guest]: television at home. So we, I drifted into reading and I had this huge desire to just

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.240
[Guest]: read because it was so entertaining that I used to read anything I could lay my hands

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:32.680
[Guest]: on. I would read the newspaper, whatever I could make of it. I would read textbooks of

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:39.680
[Guest]: my younger aunts and my uncles. I would read that salacious magazines that my uncle was

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.080
[Guest]: subscribing to a Hindi magazine called Manohar Kahania. So whatever I could figure out or

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.560
[Guest]: make of it, I used to hide in some corner of the house. Most of the time it used to

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:57.200
[Guest]: be below the staircase because nobody would be able to see me there. So I would just sit

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.680
[Guest]: there, read, or maybe go to the rooftop with everybody else. And while the other kids would

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:09.140
[Guest]: be playing, I would sit with one of the books in the corner. Came to such a pass that my

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:15.040
[Guest]: mother was very worried about me, about what kind of stuff I was reading. So if I was found

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.880
[Guest]: with something in my hand, she would immediately confiscate and check what I was doing because

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:26.400
[Guest]: I would just pick up anything randomly and start reading. And along with that, I also

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.320
[Guest]: developed sort of a desire that I also want to write what I was reading. I should be able

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:40.480
[Guest]: to produce something like this. So writing happened concurrently. It was earlier I couldn't

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:49.200
[Guest]: write prose or something, so I would dabble into some stupid poetry. And so all this was

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:56.040
[Guest]: going on. Finally, I started writing or thinking about writing a little more seriously when

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:03.720
[Guest]: my father once asked me to write something. He used to come to Delhi very frequently because

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:12.080
[Guest]: my father was an exporter and a lot of business associates. And he used to export to the state

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.000
[Guest]: trading corporation. So their office was in Delhi. So he had to come to Delhi quite often

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.760
[Guest]: to meet the bureaucrats, the government officials there. So often we used to come with him because

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:30.840
[Guest]: it was not a long journey. It would just take about four to five hours in an ambassador

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:38.280
[Guest]: car. So we used to come here and that's when sometimes he would go to Palika Bazaar and

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:46.120
[Guest]: pick up something. And from Hindi, I switched a little to English, you know, kids' magazines

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:58.160
[Guest]: like Tinkle or very basic stuff like that. So on our journey back to Agra, after one

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:04.320
[Guest]: such trip, there was a huge procession and we had to take a detour from the main road

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:12.480
[Guest]: and we went through the old city to come to our house in the mahala. And I saw a huge

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.200
[Guest]: procession there moving with a statue and I asked my father what it was. So he explained

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:25.080
[Guest]: to me that was Dr. Ambedkar's statue and the procession was being led by his followers

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:32.240
[Guest]: and they're taking it for, putting it there outside the Agra fort. They were setting it

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:38.080
[Guest]: up there. They had built a small park there where the statue was to be set up. And then

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:43.000
[Guest]: obviously I was curious who Dr. Ambedkar was. So he told me the entire story of his life,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.360
[Guest]: how he was a low caste, he had to sit outside the classroom and how despite all that because

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:55.160
[Guest]: he was so diligent, he worked so hard, he became such a huge personality that he actually

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.240
[Guest]: wrote the constitution. I mean, he told me he wrote the constitution. It's much later

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:05.160
[Guest]: that you realize what he did. So once we reached home, he asked me to write it down for him

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:12.160
[Guest]: to see if I have understood correctly. And over the next two, three days, I wrote whatever

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:20.200
[Guest]: I remembered in a very haphazard sort of English, because English was not my, neither of us

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:25.840
[Guest]: first language. And we also didn't speak English at home. So whatever language I knew, I knew

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:34.240
[Guest]: it from the school. So I wrote it down a few 10, 15 sentences and showed it to my father.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:41.200
[Guest]: He was very happy. That encouraged me a lot. I thought I have some potential as a writer.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:48.960
[Guest]: Few days later, there was this incident of two gangsters, Ranga and Billa, kidnapping

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:58.160
[Guest]: these siblings, Sanjay and Geeta. And this was all over the newspapers. We used to get

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:05.560
[Guest]: Amar Jala at home and I read the headlines. I read a little bit of the news. And I asked

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:13.480
[Guest]: my father what this incident was about. So he explained it to me. And again, he asked

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.720
[Guest]: me, why don't you write it down? So then I wrote it down. And I tried to copy the newspaper

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:26.120
[Guest]: style of writing it, like intro, just summarizing what happened and then giving a little detail.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:35.520
[Guest]: So that's how I was writing concurrently as I was reading. But my reading was not really

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:43.840
[Guest]: literature. It was reading of the papers which were coming home, reading of some stray magazines

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:51.880
[Guest]: and just whatever I could lay my hands on. That was also the time our family was, you

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:58.840
[Guest]: know, we were moving up the ladder of economic prosperity. So things were gradually changing

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:09.360
[Guest]: at home. So my access to a lot of things were also improving gradually. Subsequently, we

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:16.280
[Guest]: moved from this house to another house that my father was building. We were a nuclear

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:23.240
[Guest]: family now, except that my younger uncle had come to stay with us. And here all of us had

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.880
[Guest]: our own rooms. There were attached bathrooms, which was a huge luxury. I had never imagined

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:34.120
[Guest]: something like this. We'd only seen it in hotels. And my father had gone and set up

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:41.800
[Guest]: a place with bathtubs in each bathroom. So it was again a huge luxury. And very ambitiously,

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:48.720
[Guest]: he had built a study in this house. I'll just take you back a little bit. And my father

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:57.640
[Guest]: himself was not a school educated person. His learning of the languages was also self

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:04.720
[Guest]: tutored. And my mother also just did class 11, and then she got married. So basically,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:13.960
[Guest]: my family was not a very educated family. We came from a working class background, despite

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:20.200
[Guest]: the fact that in the caste, Muslim caste hierarchy or class hierarchy, we were number two from

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:27.760
[Guest]: the top. But in terms of education, because my grandfather, his family, they were quite

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:36.520
[Guest]: poor. And most of them were artisans. So it was more important for them to know a trade.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:43.520
[Guest]: So my grandfather knew the trade of footwear, the upper of the shoe. They used to do that

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:50.440
[Guest]: stitching of the uppers. So that is what he had learned. And my father also started like

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:55.840
[Guest]: that. He started working in a factory as a person who would cut the upper and then subsequently

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:03.480
[Guest]: he became a supervisor. And eventually he started his own factory. But his desire to

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.520
[Guest]: learn and he was very fascinated by English language. So he had approached a munshi in

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:13.520
[Guest]: the factory who used to do the accounting of, you know, he used to distribute the weekly

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.040
[Guest]: wages. So he advised my father that one of the easy ways of learning the language is

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:23.080
[Guest]: that my father could read Urdu. So he said, you subscribe to a Urdu newspaper and you

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:28.960
[Guest]: subscribe to an English newspaper. And if they are from the same organizations, the

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.640
[Guest]: news would be identical. So you could read it in Urdu and then you could try and read

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:39.800
[Guest]: in English. So he helped my father with alphabets. And my father then started reading Komi Awas

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:47.240
[Guest]: and National Herald. Both of them came from the National Herald group of papers. So he

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:56.560
[Guest]: has own learning was, it was self-tutored. So when we moved to the new house and my father

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:05.040
[Guest]: built his study, he had no exposure to literature really. And he had no references as to what

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.000
[Guest]: he should buy and what he should put in his study. So he used to come to Delhi and he

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.800
[Guest]: used to make a special trip during the Delhi Book Fair and just pick up books which looked

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:22.120
[Guest]: good or books which had some nice blurb or if somebody recommended to him. So it was

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:29.840
[Guest]: a very eclectic kind of collection and very little fiction there because he obviously

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.440
[Guest]: thought if he's spending so much money on books, the books should give him something

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.400
[Guest]: in return. I mean, he should be able to learn something. So there was a lot of history,

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:48.760
[Guest]: a lot of modern Indian history. Authors like Dominic LePere, Larry Collins, because he

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:55.560
[Guest]: thought their language was very beautiful, very evocative. Then he used to buy books

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:02.880
[Guest]: in bulk. So we had the full collection of Patel's biography by, I'm forgetting the name

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.960
[Guest]: of the author now. Then the entire collection of Nehru, collection of Gandhi. So that is

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:14.920
[Guest]: how, what the study was. So when I started reading books, it was, my introduction was

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.320
[Guest]: through nonfiction. So I was reading a lot of historical books. I was reading a lot of

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:29.040
[Guest]: biographies. I drifted to fiction much, much later in life and I was already 13 or 14 years

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:38.040
[Guest]: old when I started reading novels. And by this time, girls my age had already gone past

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:43.600
[Guest]: Enid Blyton's and Nancy Drew. So I never really grew up reading them. I probably read one

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:53.200
[Guest]: odd book of this and that, but I then moved to other authors. And so, and alongside this,

00:19:53.200 --> 00:20:02.400
[Guest]: I started fancying myself as a poet because I thought that I was introduced to Urdu poetry

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:08.120
[Guest]: through my parents. They were heavily into poetry. So I couldn't read Urdu, but I used

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:13.680
[Guest]: to ask my mother if she could read out verses to me in Urdu. Or I would nag my father to

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:20.040
[Guest]: read out passages from Maulana Azad's Khubare Khater, where he's talking about his experience

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:29.480
[Guest]: in the jail. So all this drew me to Urdu and I somehow was very attracted to the style

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:36.000
[Guest]: of Ghazals. And even though I didn't understand a lot of it, I just loved the sound of it.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.280
[Guest]: And I used to memorize verses and recite them to myself. So my parents thought that maybe

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:51.000
[Guest]: I can be a poet. So Urdu teacher was appointed and he was also a poet. So he started teaching

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.800
[Guest]: me Urdu poetry. And I started writing a few verses in Urdu, which I thought was very bad.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:07.240
[Guest]: And finally, I realized that I am terrible as a poet. And I was embarrassed of my own

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:17.720
[Guest]: verses, which I wrote. And around that time, I think I came back to English writing. And

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:27.140
[Guest]: I started writing some sort of a long form of writing, just putting together in a nonsense

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:32.640
[Guest]: ideas which would come to me or sitting in my study, looking out of the window. So I

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:38.960
[Guest]: would just write a descriptive essay sort of a thing, a short piece, just describing

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:48.880
[Guest]: that moment. Maybe what helped in this was I was a huge daydreamer. I had never been

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:55.160
[Guest]: bored of my own company. I never ever said this to anybody that I'm getting bored. If

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:00.360
[Guest]: I had nothing to do, I would just sit idle and daydream and just imagine things happening

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:08.360
[Guest]: to me, imagine things happening around me. And I could spend hours doing just that and

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:15.000
[Guest]: not be bothered at all. So when I started writing, a lot of my writing, my trial and

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.360
[Guest]: error sort of writing used to be just describing a particular scene that I was either imagining

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:29.680
[Guest]: or witnessing. So that is how I was when I was growing up. And I didn't have too many

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:37.080
[Guest]: friends. I didn't make too many friends. So I don't want to say that I was a lonely or

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:44.280
[Guest]: I preferred being on my own. But I did like to be on my own a lot of times. And even if

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:53.720
[Guest]: I was with friends, as I was growing older, I often wanted to just come back and sit in

00:22:53.720 --> 00:23:00.440
[Guest]: my room and just be on my own. And probably that was one of the reasons because I had

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.360
[Guest]: my own attached bathroom. I used to spend a lot of time in my bathroom because nobody

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:10.600
[Guest]: would disturb me there. So I would just lock myself in there and sit there for a long time.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.840
[Amit Varma]: So that is what it was growing up. Yeah, there is so much to unpack there. And

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.240
[Amit Varma]: just from sort of what you said right now, there's so much that I want to talk about.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.320
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of you know, before we get to the personal narrative of how events unfolded

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.040
[Amit Varma]: around you and your family and all of that, I'd like to stay with reading a bit like first

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:34.960
[Amit Varma]: of all, all this makes me very sort of nostalgic, because you know, younger people today don't

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.600
[Amit Varma]: realize what a joy it was to read anything that you could get your hand on back in those

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.600
[Amit Varma]: days when you didn't have the internet and the world of information at your fingertips.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.160
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I think, you know, a defining image for all Indian kids growing up in the 80s

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:52.240
[Amit Varma]: would be the one that you described of yourself sitting under the stairs reading Manohar Khania,

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:59.080
[Amit Varma]: which is, to me, you know, the story of so many people just sort of in one image, what

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:05.320
[Amit Varma]: also kind of strikes me is the multilingual nature of how you were coming up like one

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:10.160
[Amit Varma]: thing that I've realized is that, you know, being from a fairly like I was from a fairly

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.480
[Amit Varma]: privileged background. And though in one sense, it was a restriction in the sense that everything

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.040
[Amit Varma]: I read was essentially in English, I read a little bit of Hindi here and there I did

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.920
[Amit Varma]: well in school and all that in Hindi, but all my reading was English. Many of the people

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:29.520
[Amit Varma]: I later encountered in working life, were also people who grew up reading English newspapers,

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.800
[Amit Varma]: English books got everything from English. And in a certain sense, that limited their

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.360
[Amit Varma]: worldview. This is a theme I've explored with earlier guests in episodes, I think it came

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.440
[Amit Varma]: up when I was chatting with Akshay Mukul, Rahul Verma, both of whom also read in Hindi

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.400
[Amit Varma]: while growing up. And number one, did you feel that being multilingual like this reading

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:56.360
[Amit Varma]: these multiple languages, Hindi, Urdu, English, that it kind of that your vision was broader

00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.480
[Amit Varma]: than say, maybe the people you would subsequently work with in journalism or whatever that you

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.960
[Amit Varma]: had seen things that they would not have known or expected, because many of us English speaking

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.760
[Amit Varma]: elites are kind of, you know, in our little bubbles, and we don't really see the world

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:14.800
[Amit Varma]: outside. But you had, of course, through growing up, you had gotten a glimpse of that, but

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.920
[Amit Varma]: also through languages. And I'll wait for you to answer this, because there's a related

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:24.520
[Amit Varma]: question, which also fascinates me, which has to do with language. But, you know, what's

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:31.280
[Guest]: your take on this? You know, this exposure to different languages, it was not just a

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:38.440
[Guest]: question of language, it was a question of different world altogether. Hindi, as I was

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.960
[Guest]: used to go through the textbooks of my aunt, I became familiar with writings of Premchand

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:51.760
[Guest]: at a very young age, probably even at a time when I was not intelligent enough to grasp

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:57.400
[Guest]: the depth of what he was writing, but I could read and I could see a completely different

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:07.000
[Guest]: world. Or writers like, you know, Hindi versions of Manto. Now, it was hugely shocking, his

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.160
[Guest]: work for a child to be reading that it was really a completely different sort of a idiom,

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:19.600
[Guest]: a completely different sort of imagery that would conjure up in your head. So I felt that

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:28.960
[Guest]: I was exposed to a variety of things, which when I came to Delhi, and I was exposed to

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:35.360
[Guest]: entirely the English speaking group of friends in my college, and subsequently when I started

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:41.000
[Guest]: working, they were not exposed to this. So when I would talk to them, they would be talking

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:51.360
[Guest]: about Chekhov, and I would, I had read Chekhov in life, but my understanding, I mean, I could

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:57.600
[Guest]: relate to that poverty part of it, because I had some, that I had seen any poverty, I

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.400
[Guest]: didn't. I was privileged in the sense that by the time I was growing up, my family had

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:10.520
[Guest]: resources. But having read this, I could understand, I could make the connection. Probably another

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:15.200
[Guest]: thing I would want to add here is it's not just the languages in the novels or in the

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:22.000
[Guest]: books, it's also the languages of the newspapers. And I would come back to the newspaper for

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.480
[Guest]: the simple reason, as a journalist, my exposure to newspaper writing in India has been greater.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:36.200
[Guest]: And I have seen how newspapers have evolved in India since the mid 80s onwards. Mid 80s

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:42.760
[Guest]: was the time when I was in my teens, and I was reading the newspapers on a very regular

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:52.600
[Guest]: basis. I'll give you a small example. In the 80s, probably there was a government directive

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:58.920
[Guest]: that if there was a communal riot or a violence somewhere, the communities would not be identified.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:04.520
[Guest]: So it was all, the newspaper reports would say one community has rioted and the second

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.040
[Guest]: community reacted. Then the police opened fire and four members of one community have.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:16.280
[Guest]: So they would be like that, very vague. I always was curious, who are these communities?

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:21.160
[Guest]: Who was the instigator? Who started the riot? Who were the people killed? But the English

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:26.600
[Guest]: newspapers would not put this out, maybe out of the government order or out of deference

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:33.160
[Guest]: for sentiments or whatever. But the Hindi newspaper were very clever. They, papers like

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:40.360
[Guest]: Amarajala, Adenik, they would say Bahusankhyak, which is majority, and they would say Alpsankhyak.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:46.360
[Guest]: So you would know which community has done what. So they were cutting across the government

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:53.600
[Guest]: directive in a very clever way. The Urdu newspapers would identify. They would identify the victims

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:58.800
[Guest]: by, not by the community, but by names. So you knew that in the police firing, Javed

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:04.640
[Guest]: and Saje that so and so have died. So they were actually short circuiting the government.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:12.320
[Guest]: So I realised that the English journalism, for the sake of being fair and not instigating

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:19.720
[Guest]: more violence or whatever the principles, was only conveying half a story. So as a reference

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:27.600
[Guest]: to a particular event, you would not get the correct picture. Whereas the vernacular would

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:34.640
[Guest]: give you in some way, it would, it would manage to convey the actual story. The other thing

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:40.960
[Guest]: was that in English journalism, it was said that, you know, the reporter should be invisible.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:47.440
[Guest]: You know, you should not show yourself because that invisibility ensures or it was meant

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:54.560
[Guest]: to ensure some kind of impartiality. But in the vernacular writing, the reporter would

00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:00.160
[Guest]: be invisible, but reporter's bias would be very, very obvious. So it was, when I was

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:08.000
[Guest]: growing up, even then in Agra, I was conscious of the fact that this particular reporter,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.600
[Guest]: if he's saying this, there is a lot of exaggeration in a certain report. So you don't have to

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:20.160
[Guest]: show yourself up, but your bias shows. So when I come to Delhi and I was studying in

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:29.760
[Guest]: college and I used to interact with my classmates, I realized that our sensibilities and sensitivity

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:35.680
[Guest]: towards our environment were very, very different. For example, another example, this Mandal

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:43.480
[Guest]: agitation was at its peak when I joined college. And I found that most of my classmates were

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:50.840
[Guest]: actually just repeating what probably they had heard at home and their anger, their rage

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:59.480
[Guest]: against the recommendations was not really reflective of what the truth or the history

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:11.200
[Guest]: of India has been. So I was amazed that this sort of a privileged overhang over these people,

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:20.240
[Guest]: how much it enables prejudice, how much it is a factor in encouraging a biased view of

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:29.200
[Guest]: your own society. So there's another thing, because of this exposure to multilingual writing,

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:37.400
[Guest]: both in books and newspapers, I also felt that now when everybody talks about Ganga

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:45.880
[Guest]: Jamuni and people talk about Ganga Jamuni culture of North India, especially the UP,

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:54.840
[Guest]: Bihar and parts of Northern Madhya Pradesh, people who have not seen this through literature,

00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:03.280
[Guest]: through writings of a certain period, they assume what the culture would be. See, if

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:12.360
[Guest]: you read short stories by Premchand, you would realize that it was not just celebrating each

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:19.080
[Guest]: other's festivals. It was not just going to somebody's house on Eid or Diwali. There was

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:25.200
[Guest]: so much of economic interdependence. The characters were organic, but irrespective of religion,

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.960
[Guest]: characters used to be organic with the stories because that is how a small town or rural

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:37.280
[Guest]: India lived. There was so much of social and economic engagement with each other. So now

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:42.600
[Guest]: a lot of people when they talk about, oh, but we always greeted our Muslim friends on

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:48.360
[Guest]: Eid or our Hindu friends, we played Holi with them. That's just one and probably a superficial

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:54.720
[Guest]: part of it. It doesn't really convey the kind of dependence you had on each other, the kind

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.280
[Guest]: of trust you had on each other. I'm sorry if I'm giving too many examples. Can I give

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.280
[Guest]: one more example?

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.440
[Amit Varma]: Please, please go ahead. There's no such thing as too many examples.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:14.280
[Guest]: You know, I had met one gentleman in Delhi while I was working on my book, but I had,

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:21.400
[Guest]: he was from Farooqabad. So he was narrating the incident of when he was growing up there.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:28.160
[Guest]: His family lived in a village where the majority in the village were not Muslims. And his family

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:33.440
[Guest]: was among the two or three Muslim families in that village. But whenever anybody went

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:39.320
[Guest]: out of the village to visit somewhere or go on a holiday, irrespective of religion, such

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:45.160
[Guest]: was the stature of this person's father, that he used to, everybody, whoever was going would

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:50.680
[Guest]: leave the house keys, leave the cattle, everything with this family, that you please take care

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:56.080
[Guest]: of our cattle, you take care of our house while you're away. So that was the level of

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:04.040
[Guest]: trust and that was the lived heritage of those people, that community, irrespective of religion.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:10.280
[Guest]: So this is something which you will, you know, if you are either from this area, or you have

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:16.280
[Guest]: the sensibility to see it, even if it's not very obvious.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.680
[Amit Varma]: Fascinating. Again, there's a lot to unpack here. You know, all of these answers of yours

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.600
[Amit Varma]: are like little Chinese boxes, you open one layer, and there's another layer below that,

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, so before we get to kind of the subject at hand, and what you've written about

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.800
[Amit Varma]: in your book, you know, I'll just take one more digression with due apology to my listeners,

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.720
[Amit Varma]: because it's a subject that fascinates me. And it again has to do with language. So now

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:40.760
[Amit Varma]: I teach this online writing course. And a few months back, you know, one of the girls

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:47.480
[Amit Varma]: who was doing that, who had this very sharp way of observing things, but the language

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:52.200
[Amit Varma]: was a little not quite formed yet. And she kind of came to me with a problem. And she

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:56.480
[Amit Varma]: said, you know, the thing is, English is not my first language. So I'm having trouble kind

00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:02.160
[Amit Varma]: of expressing it. And what can I do? And at that point, I remembered, author I had discovered

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:07.240
[Amit Varma]: called Agatha Christophe, like I'd watched an interview of Jhumpa Lahiri by Tyler Cowen.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.440
[Amit Varma]: And I link all of these from the show notes. And what Lahiri had done was, her languages

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.080
[Amit Varma]: are English and Bengali, but she learned Italian from scratch. And then she wrote a book in

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.720
[Amit Varma]: Italian. So as an adult, you're learning a whole new language, and you're writing a book

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:24.240
[Amit Varma]: in that. So when Tyler asked her about that, she pointed to the example of Agatha Christophe,

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:30.040
[Amit Varma]: who essentially I think, during the war, shifted as an adult to France from somewhere maybe

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.900
[Amit Varma]: Hungary or wherever, I don't remember, but shifted to France, learned French at the age

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:40.240
[Amit Varma]: of 2021. And then wrote a series of incredible books in French, a completely new language

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:46.520
[Amit Varma]: to her. So I recommended to this, the participant in my course that why don't you try reading

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:52.320
[Amit Varma]: Agatha Christophe, because her language is very sparse, very powerful, and all of that.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.720
[Amit Varma]: And she recently told me a few months after I gave her the record, that one, she loved

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:02.440
[Amit Varma]: those books. And two, what she started doing was that she started, you know, copying from

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:07.960
[Amit Varma]: the book in the sense writing each sentence again by hand, to get a closer sense of what

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:13.200
[Amit Varma]: the language was like. And that struck me as something beautiful and inspiring. Because

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:19.200
[Amit Varma]: what it means is that you're looking at the language with, you know, so to say, gehraayi

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.640
[Amit Varma]: and nazdiki, which you otherwise don't, because we people, like I take English for granted,

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.120
[Amit Varma]: I have to remind myself to be mindful and, you know, go word by word, notice all the

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:34.600
[Amit Varma]: little intricacies of it. But because she was kind of new to it, she was doing this

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.600
[Amit Varma]: and it struck me as such a beautiful thing to do. And therefore, I want to ask that,

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:43.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, you mentioned that you, at one point, you were drawn to poetry. And it again, struck

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:49.760
[Amit Varma]: me that, you know, anyone who is, for example, exposed to Urdu, would turn to poetry because

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:54.840
[Amit Varma]: Urdu is such a beautiful lyrical language, you know, English almost seems like a functional

00:36:54.840 --> 00:37:01.120
[Amit Varma]: kind of dry language compared to that. So your experience in these different languages,

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:05.440
[Amit Varma]: do you think, in some ways, it shaped the book you write? Like, you know, everything

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:12.160
[Amit Varma]: that you've written is obviously very accomplished. No one can tell that English is sort of not

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:17.200
[Amit Varma]: your mother tongue in that sense. So, you know, did you ever during the course of your

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:23.000
[Amit Varma]: time, pay that kind of attention to language growing up? Maybe, you know, like everybody,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.040
[Amit Varma]: of course, as I get into journalism and writing will pay attention to craft, they learn to

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:32.880
[Amit Varma]: edit, they learn to do all of that. But did you feel that there was some, you know, element

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.200
[Amit Varma]: of looking deeper at the language while you were writing in it?

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:43.040
[Guest]: Actually, no, I think language, or writing in English came very naturally to me, I have

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:49.160
[Guest]: no idea how. Even when I was writing grammatically incorrect English, my tenses would be a bit

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:59.320
[Guest]: heavier. I was always able to put the imagery that I was thinking what I was looking at

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:07.600
[Guest]: on paper. When I was in first year college, some like, I think the general elections announced

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:14.160
[Guest]: and I had gone to Agra. And I saw this, I'm forgetting the name of the candidate, Nihal

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:22.600
[Guest]: Singh or somebody. I saw an entourage of this guy. During the campaign, I was driving on

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:27.840
[Guest]: the highway and just short of Agra, there was a dhaba and I, these guys were there.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:34.920
[Guest]: So I saw that entourage and I, I just liked that image, the visual image it conjured up

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:42.080
[Guest]: of people in white kurtas and topis and all those chirpais just outside the dhaba and,

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:47.360
[Guest]: you know, some guys coming, people coming, touching the feet of this candidate. And so

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:54.880
[Guest]: I, we had stopped at the dhaba for tea and I was watching these things happening there.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:02.080
[Guest]: And it was so fascinating for me that I wrote that scene. And when I came back to college,

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:07.160
[Guest]: I was, we were sitting with some friends and I showed it to one of them. And then somehow

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:13.160
[Guest]: it went to my class teacher's hands. I don't know how that went there. And he was so fascinated.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:18.280
[Guest]: He asked me to come and read it out. So I was made to read it out to the class. And

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:21.680
[Guest]: I was embarrassed because while I was reading, I realized that there were a lot of mistakes

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:27.320
[Guest]: in it. The articles were missing in some places because I had just written it because it was

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:33.560
[Guest]: fascinating. So he told me that, you know, you have a very descriptive way of writing

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:40.480
[Guest]: in this thing. Maybe you should pursue this a little more seriously. And I realized that

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:47.440
[Guest]: even though I was probably not as proficient with the grammar of the language, I was able

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:54.960
[Guest]: to express myself and maybe use it in a way to describe things and maybe describe them

00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:03.000
[Guest]: in a manner which gives you a sense of what I had seen. So probably the Urdu poetry played

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.800
[Guest]: a role in this because there is a form in Urdu poetry, which is a descriptive form,

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:12.160
[Guest]: you know, beyond Urdu poetry has a lot of forms. I mean, the most popular are ghazals

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:17.760
[Guest]: and rubais to some extent. But then there are other forms also. There are forms where

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:24.480
[Guest]: you are describing scenes. There are forms where you're exaggerating situations. So it

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:31.600
[Guest]: has a variety of forms. So when I was learning the poetry from my teacher, he acquainted

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:37.200
[Guest]: me with these forms. And I was fascinated that actually poetry is not enough. Within

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:47.240
[Guest]: the poetry also, you have distinguished one form from another. And probably that had some

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:54.720
[Guest]: sort of impact on me, just describing a situation as it was. Why I'm going on about describing

00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:01.760
[Guest]: a part is that maybe when I became a journalist, when I joined my first job, it was, I mean,

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.440
[Guest]: my seniors decided that I should get into feature writing because I was more suited

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:11.680
[Guest]: for feature writing as opposed to daily news reporting, because news reporting doesn't

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:19.080
[Guest]: give you the option of or the luxury of just going off tangent and spending so much of

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:29.440
[Guest]: space on building up the situation or building up the story. So I don't think I had a struggle

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:37.200
[Guest]: as far as writing was concerned. The struggle part was always trying to cut short my flight

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.960
[Guest]: of fancy and come to the point.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.040
[Amit Varma]: That's really fascinating. And, you know, someday we should do an episode on the different

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:48.640
[Amit Varma]: forms of writing in Urdu and all of that. But I suspect if I, although this is one of

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:53.440
[Amit Varma]: my sort of pet themes, if I continue talking more with you about this, my listeners will

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:57.520
[Amit Varma]: be that, hey, that's not the subject of the book, kindly get on with it. So, you know,

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:02.440
[Amit Varma]: and it's interesting, you just spoke about how when you were in college in the late 80s,

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:06.160
[Amit Varma]: when Mundell commission happened and your classmates approach and all and in the book,

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:12.540
[Amit Varma]: you also said something very interesting there, which is that none of them asked you anything

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:16.900
[Amit Varma]: about yourself that even if they had their anti Muslim prejudices and all of that as

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:22.520
[Amit Varma]: evident in their politics, you know, you almost wish that they would ask you what are Muslims

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:26.240
[Amit Varma]: like, what is it like to be a Muslim and they never asked you, which was in contrast to

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:32.240
[Amit Varma]: something which, you know, you described from your school days, when you write, quote, their

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:37.280
[Amit Varma]: questions covered the entire gamut from genuine curiosity to inherited prejudice. Why do you

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.480
[Amit Varma]: fast during Ramzan? Do you put meat in all your food? Some questions stemmed from stereotyping.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.480
[Amit Varma]: Why don't Muslims bathe every day? And some were downright ridiculous. How many mothers

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:53.200
[Amit Varma]: do you have? Stop quote. And so my question to you is that, you know, on the one hand,

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:58.400
[Amit Varma]: you are growing up in a Muslim family in a Muslim Mahalla. At the same time, your family

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:03.360
[Amit Varma]: is kind of insulated itself from the street around it, like you describe how, you know,

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.000
[Amit Varma]: all the rooms would have a window open to the inner courtyard, but none to the outside

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
[Amit Varma]: because you know, like you mentioned earlier, you weren't supposed to venture out, it wasn't

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:18.520
[Amit Varma]: safe, it wasn't great. So what was your personal view of Islam as a kid growing up? How big

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:23.520
[Amit Varma]: a role did it play in your life? And how did you imbibe it? What did it mean to you? And

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:28.320
[Amit Varma]: what did it mean to the other kids around you, like your cousins and so on?

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:33.240
[Guest]: You know, when we were growing up, we were initiated into religion in a very simplistic

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:39.960
[Guest]: manner. As kids, we were taught the first Kalma, which is just two lines. And that was

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:45.520
[Guest]: enough. Beyond that, there was no formal initiation in terms of learning how to say the namaz

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:49.960
[Guest]: or learning to read the Quran, which is what happens in most Muslim households. You start

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:56.080
[Guest]: learning the alphabets from a very young age. And in a conservative Muslim family, a child

00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:02.480
[Guest]: is expected to finish the entire reading of the Quran by the time she is seven years old.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:08.160
[Guest]: But in my family, that never happened. Not just my immediate siblings, but my cousins

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:16.120
[Guest]: also, we never did that. Though we had a mosque right next to our house. And I grew up listening

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:21.200
[Guest]: to the Muslims call from childhood. So much so because I used to hear it five times a

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.880
[Guest]: day and sometimes more than that, because on special occasions, there used to be late

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:34.720
[Guest]: night prayers as well. And because of which I knew it by heart. And sometimes, as part

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.480
[Guest]: of our playing, we used to do a little bit of play acting. So one of my cousins would

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:46.400
[Guest]: pretend to be the Hafiz who would give the call to prayer. So he would recite the prayer

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:53.960
[Guest]: and we would join in. So it was all in good fun. Why we were not initiated into religion?

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:59.680
[Guest]: Probably because my grandfather himself had a very laid back attitude to Islam. Though

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:04.280
[Guest]: he was very diligent with his prayers and used to go to the mosque whenever he could.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:10.640
[Guest]: He never forced any of his children to do that. So his children didn't force their kids

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:15.520
[Guest]: to do anything. It was left in a very laid back, easy manner that you recite the Kalma

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.960
[Guest]: whenever you're worried or you're scared or before going to bed, just recite the Kalma

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:25.040
[Guest]: and go to bed. That is a habit I have even today. I recite the Kalma before I go to bed.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:31.960
[Guest]: But that is how we were introduced to religion. It was only years later when we had moved

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:39.280
[Guest]: to our new house and we were moving in a different direction from my cousins, that my uncles

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:45.440
[Guest]: who were in the mohalla, maybe because there was no adult supervision. I mean, they themselves

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:52.880
[Guest]: were adults with kids, but maybe because there was no umbrella of moderation, which my grandfather

00:45:52.880 --> 00:46:00.560
[Guest]: had provided to the family. And then my father, they kind of drifted first into the neighborhood.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:05.000
[Guest]: They made friends in the neighborhood. Then the children, their kids, my younger cousins,

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:12.280
[Guest]: they started playing with the neighborhood kids. And then a religious teacher, Hafiz

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:18.920
[Guest]: was asked to teach my cousins. The reason he was asked was also because Hafiz had started

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:24.200
[Guest]: to come to our house because my grandfather's illness and it was thought that his presence

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:32.480
[Guest]: would calm my grandfather and would make his day a little less boring. But despite the

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:39.400
[Guest]: presence of a religious teacher in our house, my parents did not encourage us to learn anything

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:47.840
[Guest]: from him. But my cousins started doing that. So that difference in this approach to religion,

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:54.720
[Guest]: I think also had a little to do with the time that we were living in. By the late 80s, a

00:46:54.720 --> 00:47:03.680
[Guest]: lot of social situations had started to become a little bit shaded. There was a little consciousness

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:11.200
[Guest]: about who you were. The Ram Mandir campaign had started. 84 onwards, there was this Babri

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:18.360
[Guest]: issue had suddenly become a big issue in U.P. The newspapers used to be full of that. Hindi

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:25.760
[Guest]: newspapers would be full of stuff like appeasement of minorities, as they would say, alp sankhekon

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:32.480
[Guest]: ka tushrikaran. So people were becoming a little conscious of their identities. And

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:40.840
[Guest]: maybe this initiation into religion was also a kind of a defiance that this is who we are.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:48.480
[Guest]: So I think that is why my, okay, there's another thing which I feel, because like my father,

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:54.580
[Guest]: my uncles were also semi-literate. So my father worked on himself and he studied the languages

00:47:54.580 --> 00:48:00.000
[Guest]: and his aspirations were different from his brother's. My uncles didn't do that. So they

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:07.400
[Guest]: remained in their semi-literate Hindi-dominated world, Indian-dominated world. And as I mentioned

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:14.680
[Guest]: earlier, the exposure to our world at that time was through the Hindi newspapers and

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:22.800
[Guest]: the Urdu newspapers, and they both had nuance towards identity. So while the Hindi newspapers

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:28.200
[Guest]: were conscious of its readership, which is a Hindi readership, and they imagined that

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:35.040
[Guest]: this readership would probably like a story or a bent which favoured the Hindu communal

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:43.200
[Guest]: sentiment, the Urdu newspapers were at the same time working on the Muslim sentiments.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:50.920
[Guest]: So their exposure was getting increasingly sharpened through this sort of writing. Probably

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:56.480
[Guest]: that was another reason why they, and then subsequently my younger cousins, were drifting

00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:03.560
[Guest]: more and more into a Muslim milieu. The friends they chose also were traditionally Muslims.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:08.520
[Guest]: Though they went to the same schools as I went, I never had a Muslim friend in school.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:13.720
[Guest]: I mean one of the reasons was there was hardly any other Muslim child in my class. At least

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.520
[Guest]: as long as I was in the convent, I was always the only Muslim girl in my class. Subsequently

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:25.640
[Guest]: I moved to a co-educational institution, again a church-run institution. There was another

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:31.160
[Guest]: Muslim in my class, but somehow I never got along with a Muslim and there was no desire

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:38.080
[Guest]: that I should befriend a Muslim person. Similarly, that person also never felt that she should

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:43.720
[Guest]: have a Muslim friend, so I had a different group of friends. But my younger cousins,

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:50.300
[Guest]: I realised gradually that they used to veer towards Muslims more than any other community

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:57.360
[Guest]: for the simple reason they felt comfortable with probably voicing their political positions,

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:03.520
[Guest]: they felt secure in a Muslim environment. That was also one of the reasons that for

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:08.800
[Guest]: a very long time my uncles didn't shift out of the mohalla, though they had means to shift

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:14.480
[Guest]: out. It's not that they were not doing well in their businesses, but they had grown comfortable

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:20.920
[Guest]: in that. When I was growing up, we were not comfortable in that, which is why we had kept

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:26.640
[Guest]: our house isolated. It was almost like an island in that mohalla. But they had become

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:31.400
[Guest]: comfortable. They had become comfortable going and visiting their neighbours' houses and

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:36.840
[Guest]: they were happy that neighbours were coming to their houses. So that was a difference.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:41.200
[Amit Varma]: So before I go on to my next question, a quick aside. You know, my favourite sentence in

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:46.160
[Amit Varma]: your book is actually, you know, a great example of show-don't-tell and it's this lovely sentence

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:51.840
[Amit Varma]: about your grandfather where you wrote, quote, during winter he used to shell pine nuts during

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:57.200
[Amit Varma]: the day so he could reward us with fistfuls of shelled nuts in the evening, stop quote.

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's such a lovely sentence because it tells you so much about the person and his

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.400
[Amit Varma]: love for his grandkids and all of that. And I love that. Now, you know, it's interesting

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:11.920
[Amit Varma]: that when I was sort of reading about the arc of your family, almost through the generations,

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:17.380
[Amit Varma]: you talk about how initially, you know, your ancestors were, you know, in a settlement

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:22.640
[Amit Varma]: outside Agra. And then your grandfather married a Syed, as you said, and, you know, wanted

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:27.960
[Amit Varma]: to be upwardly mobile, moved to Agra for that reason. But even moving to Agra wasn't the

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:32.520
[Amit Varma]: mobility alone, the mobility had to continue. So even though they had to move into a mahalla,

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:38.120
[Amit Varma]: they've kind of kept themselves apart from everything outside. In fact, you know, you

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:43.600
[Amit Varma]: describe how that lane outside was described to you as, quote, riddled with poverty, illiteracy,

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:48.020
[Amit Varma]: backwardness and unthinkable danger, stop quote, which strikes me how many Hindus would

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:53.520
[Amit Varma]: describe Muslim areas, even today. And then that further mobility happens where your nuclear

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:58.520
[Amit Varma]: family and a younger uncle, you move to a separate place. And here, what is sort of

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:04.440
[Amit Varma]: interesting to me is that you've gotten away from this sort of milieu, you've become mobile,

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:09.560
[Amit Varma]: your dad has become very successful and rich. And you've moved, you know, almost out of

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:14.640
[Amit Varma]: the ghetto, as it were. And, you know, you're living your individual lives. And at the same

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:19.440
[Amit Varma]: time, you described how your other uncles with their families remain back and they kind

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:24.520
[Amit Varma]: of got drawn more and more into fundamentalism, in a sense, they open the doors and the windows

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:30.280
[Amit Varma]: and let the lane inside in a metaphorical sense, I suppose, and that sort of journey

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:36.760
[Amit Varma]: is happening. And they also then become more into the religion in terms of those other

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:40.800
[Amit Varma]: sort of aspects of it, like you describe how for you, what Islam meant, as you've said,

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.560
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned how it came to you by driblets, which I found a, you know, wonderful phrase

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.880
[Amit Varma]: in this regard. And you've mentioned how those sort of values you imbibe with the values

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:53.080
[Amit Varma]: of charity that you know, during the holy month, you do charity, you feed the poor,

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:58.440
[Amit Varma]: all of those things. But your cousins are taking in a sort of more fundamental version.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:03.760
[Amit Varma]: And what is sort of starkest about this distinction was that when you are 16, your father is giving

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:08.000
[Amit Varma]: you prospectuses of universities abroad, because he wants you to go outside. And you describe

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.720
[Amit Varma]: how when you are writing an admission essay for one of them, one of your cousins in the

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:17.280
[Amit Varma]: mahala is being felicitated for memorizing the entire Quran. And the reason this all

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:23.840
[Amit Varma]: of this seemed fascinating to me is that the denouement that this comes to is an incident

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:30.600
[Amit Varma]: where your father realizes that all this still doesn't insulate him from being a Muslim,

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:35.360
[Amit Varma]: that in India, there is, you know, there are still things which can sort of go wrong and

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:39.760
[Amit Varma]: all the riches in the world can't save you, you know, and this, of course, you've described

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:44.160
[Amit Varma]: so eloquently in your book about how your house was attacked during a riot, and you

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:48.080
[Amit Varma]: dialed all the numbers. And, you know, your father told you gave you all the numbers said

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:52.640
[Amit Varma]: dial all these numbers, people were outside with stones, and all of your father's, you

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:56.960
[Amit Varma]: know, friends did not pick up the phone at that time did not help. Tell me a little bit

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:01.960
[Amit Varma]: about that and sort of the realization that comes out of that because this is like a deeply

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:06.620
[Amit Varma]: poignant story. This is about, you know, different arcs, you know, you have the people who stayed

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:11.280
[Amit Varma]: back in the mahala, you have the person who's escaped and who thinks that okay, he's beyond

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:18.280
[Amit Varma]: all of this. And yet, all of you are in a sense equally in danger in this India that

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:23.040
[Amit Varma]: we are in. So tell me a little bit which year was this what was happening and all of that,

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:28.640
[Guest]: you know, we, I never thought of myself as a Muslim while I was growing up, even when

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:35.240
[Guest]: we lived in the mahala. So when I described the lanes, or when I have described the mahala,

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:40.680
[Guest]: it was not something that I was condemning my own. Even at that time, when we were growing

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:45.920
[Guest]: up, my family always thought that, why do they live like this? What is wrong with them?

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:54.720
[Guest]: Why are the lanes kept so dirty? So we, they wanted to insulate us from what they viewed

00:54:54.720 --> 00:55:01.760
[Guest]: was people of a certain kind, not necessarily Muslims, though they were Muslims, all right,

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:07.840
[Guest]: but we did not see ourselves as Muslims and we did not see them as Muslims. We just always

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:14.880
[Guest]: thought that these people are less civil than we are and they have less ambitions and less

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:25.960
[Guest]: desire to go beyond what they have inherited from their forefathers. So when we moved to

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:32.200
[Guest]: this new area, which in India areas like this are called colonies, so we moved to this Hindu

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:40.040
[Guest]: colony, we did not think at that point that we were the only Muslim in a Hindu colony.

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:47.560
[Guest]: We were not conscious of our Muslimness and to our neighbor's credit, they also never

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:53.280
[Guest]: made us conscious of our Muslimness. We got along fabulously with them and my parents

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:57.880
[Guest]: were socializing with them. They were used to come to our house and there was a lot of

00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:05.080
[Guest]: intermingling in addition to special occasions. It's not that we met each other only on special

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:09.200
[Guest]: occasions. There was a daily sort of a thing. My brother used to go out to play because

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:14.360
[Guest]: now it was not a mohalla, so we were allowed to go out and play. And all the playmates

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:20.640
[Guest]: were the neighborhood boys. So we were never conscious of the fact that we were different

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:29.120
[Guest]: from the rest of them. A small example, so much so that a lot of neighborhood youngsters

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:35.840
[Guest]: were older, much older than me, but roughly my younger uncle's age. They used to socialize

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:41.320
[Guest]: with him also because my uncle had a car so they could hitch a ride and go for a night

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:50.000
[Guest]: out. So that was, it was never considered that we were not part of this new society

00:56:50.000 --> 00:57:01.800
[Guest]: that we had embraced. When the 80s progressed and this atmospherics had changed so drastically,

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:08.080
[Guest]: it was the first time that I actually became conscious that people were talking of Hindu

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:21.240
[Guest]: and Muslim and in such harsh terms. My mother was into a lot of social work. My father was

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:28.800
[Guest]: a big philanthropist. So she used to go to a lot of public functions and events. I remember

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:37.320
[Guest]: sometimes in 88 or 89 probably, I don't know the year exactly, there was a big police function

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:43.960
[Guest]: in Agra. And my mother was invited to that function as one of the delegates or some attendee.

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:51.000
[Guest]: But my mother used to work with the Agra district jail people and she was doing some work in

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:57.640
[Guest]: adult literacy with the women, the families of the jail inmates. Because at district jail

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:03.640
[Guest]: people, most people who were there, the prisoners, they were there serving life sentences. So

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:10.040
[Guest]: the jail had built a small enclosure there for the families and kids to live. So my mother

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:16.760
[Guest]: used to, with a group of people, she was working in that area. So she was invited to this event,

00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:23.440
[Guest]: police, Agra police event, and I tagged along with her because I had nothing better to do.

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:32.600
[Guest]: And BP Singhal, who was the brother of Ashok Singhal, he retired as a DG police UP. He

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:38.880
[Guest]: was one of the speakers at the function. And the kind of language he used at that event

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:46.040
[Guest]: and the way he spoke, it was beyond shocking. I could not believe that in a public event

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:51.800
[Guest]: where all kinds of people are present, somebody could speak like this and not feel embarrassed,

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:56.600
[Guest]: not feel concerned that some people may get hurt or they may feel bad the way you're talking

00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:03.280
[Guest]: about them. And the fact that we are sitting there, it didn't occur to him that he should

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:10.120
[Guest]: not be talking like this. And then there was stray slogan shouting. So every time somebody

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:15.080
[Guest]: would shout a slogan or say something, I would turn back and see who's saying this. But obviously

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:22.200
[Guest]: you can't see it. It's a huge crowd. So that was very disturbing. I had not imagined something

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:26.760
[Guest]: like this could happen in a public space. I thought probably if even people feel like

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:31.960
[Guest]: that, they would talk about this inside their homes and be mindful that nobody else hears

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:37.720
[Guest]: this. Even in my own family, extended family, I used to hear things like, you know, there

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:45.160
[Guest]: is all of us are prejudiced. We kind of inherit our prejudices. So we would talk. I mean,

00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:51.000
[Guest]: my family members would often talk about Hindus or Christians or Sikhs in a particular manner,

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:56.880
[Guest]: but it would always be inside the house and it was always among the close family members.

00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:03.560
[Guest]: It was not meant for public consumption. But here this was being said loud and clear in

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:13.160
[Guest]: an event where all kinds of people were present. So I realized that things were really not

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:21.720
[Guest]: right. Things were going bad. And then these audio cassettes came of Advani and Sadhvi

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:28.560
[Guest]: Ritambara and their speeches. They were being distributed. One of my father's closest friends,

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:34.240
[Guest]: all my father's friends were also Hindus. So he started distributing the cassettes and

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.920
[Guest]: then he would have discussions with my father, which again is a measure of how comfortable

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:44.160
[Guest]: he was with my father and how comfortable my father was with him. And he would discuss

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:50.360
[Guest]: the content of the speeches. He would talk about barbary, he would talk about destruction

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:54.960
[Guest]: of temples. And my father would say, no, no, it's all nonsense. And they both would have

01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:00.480
[Guest]: these arguments, but they would have these arguments that Somnath was destroyed so many

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:05.200
[Guest]: times. And so my father would reason out that, look, it was political. And maybe how would

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.520
[Guest]: he know every time that the temple was flushed with funds? If he was coming at the time when

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.320
[Guest]: the temple was flushed, then somebody was informing him. That is how he was coming all

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:23.360
[Guest]: the way from Afghanistan. But the good part was that though their paths were diverging

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:30.480
[Guest]: a little, politically they were getting distant, they still had this history of friendship

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:36.480
[Guest]: between them. So they could talk. But when I came to Delhi, nobody spoke to me about

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.920
[Guest]: this. Nobody asked me any question, which is what disturbed me the most, that if you

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:48.040
[Guest]: have any questions about Muslims, if you think that Muslims as people are different in a

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:52.480
[Guest]: particular way because this is what they've done wrong, then if you ask me, maybe I can

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:59.240
[Guest]: find out the answer for you if I don't know. But that did not happen. So going back to

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:06.640
[Guest]: the attack, the 1990, I was already in college and I had already seen what was happening

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:13.040
[Guest]: in Delhi and my classmates. And all of them were voting BJP. All of us were first-time

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:19.560
[Guest]: voters and they said, no, no, how can we vote for anybody else? We vote for the BJP. And

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:27.000
[Guest]: whatever people may say or justify, the truth is the history of the BJP origin song is it

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:35.080
[Guest]: stems from otherization of certain group of people in India. They've always done politics

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:43.760
[Guest]: which pits community against community. So nobody can whitewash this part about the BJP.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:48.520
[Guest]: So despite this, if some people are convinced that they only want to vote for that party,

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:54.000
[Guest]: it means that you at some level agree with them or you at some level believe that what

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.160
[Guest]: they're saying is correct. So it was this sort of a background that I was called back

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:06.320
[Guest]: home and our neighbors were coming and warning my parents that something is going to happen.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:13.040
[Guest]: You go back to your house in the mahala. Violence had broken out in Agra in certain areas. One

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:20.240
[Guest]: of my uncle's friends, his shop, he had a shoe shop that was burned. So we all were

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:30.040
[Guest]: quite anxious. Finally, my father said, okay, we didn't want to go back to the mahala. Because

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:35.440
[Guest]: once you leave, in any case, it was a small house. And once we left, the rooms that we

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:43.160
[Guest]: had was now occupied by my cousins and my other uncle's family. So then my father booked

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:51.320
[Guest]: us in Mughal Sheraton and my mother drove us to the hotel. Then sometimes in the late

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:58.640
[Guest]: afternoon, she got very anxious. And this was the day when our neighbors had persistently

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:05.080
[Guest]: pushed my father that, you know, we have information and there's nothing we can do. And my father

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:09.840
[Guest]: saw their point. You know, you can't argue with a mob and you don't know what the mob

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:18.800
[Guest]: would do or what the size of the mob would be. And it doesn't really make sense that

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:25.720
[Guest]: you expect your neighbors to stick their necks out. They could probably, but why take a chance?

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:31.840
[Guest]: So my father sent us off, but we came back in the afternoon because my mother was very,

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:39.280
[Guest]: very anxious. And sure enough, in the evening, there was a lot of slogan shouting happening.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:45.000
[Guest]: So my father gave me this telephone book and he said, just call up these people, keep calling

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.680
[Guest]: them up and tell them that our house is likely to be under attack. And these are the people

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:57.840
[Guest]: my father had been socializing with for many years. You know, in a small town, whenever

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:04.760
[Guest]: there is a new DM or a new DIG, it's customary. I mean, they also come and they ask their

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:10.000
[Guest]: office staff that who are the people that we should know. And the business families,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.680
[Guest]: they also feel that it's a matter of prestige that you're friends with the district authorities.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:21.720
[Guest]: So apart from the prestige part, it's also some sort of insurance cover that if you need,

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:28.440
[Guest]: you can ask these guys to help you. So we knew most of the district authorities very,

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:37.800
[Guest]: very well. But that evening, nobody answered any calls, even though I called up the residences

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:48.840
[Guest]: also, but nobody answered any calls. And around dusk when it had just about to get a bit dark,

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:59.360
[Guest]: a mob started walking towards our house. And our house is, we have a very narrow, a short

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:06.000
[Guest]: porch and then there's a gate. And the inside door has a glass panel on one side. So from

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.600
[Guest]: the glass panel, you can see the porch and the gate and the road beyond. So my brother,

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:17.440
[Guest]: younger brother and I, we ran to the glass panel and we started looking out and we saw

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:24.480
[Guest]: this big group of people carrying fire torches walking towards our house. And my mother was

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:29.840
[Guest]: screaming, she said, come back in, come back in, because she thought we may get hurt. And

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:35.880
[Guest]: they came and stopped in front of the gate and they were shouting slogans. And then we

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:42.440
[Guest]: identified this neighborhood boy and we came back, we ran inside and said, oh, this boy

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:48.400
[Guest]: is there. So my father was very sanguine. He said, oh, so obviously they won't do anything

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:55.240
[Guest]: because this boy, he knows us so well. But then they started throwing stones and that

01:06:55.240 --> 01:07:02.600
[Guest]: is when everybody panicked because the distance between the gate and the house is not much.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:08.520
[Guest]: And my father had a licensed revolver. So my uncle knew where it was kept. He went in

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:14.200
[Guest]: my father's room, he took it out and he tried to go to the rooftop and he said, I'll just

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:19.520
[Guest]: fire a few shots in the air. And my father had better sense. He shouted and screamed

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:25.720
[Guest]: after him and my mother also kind of ran after him to pull him back physically. Father said

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:32.160
[Guest]: that if you fire one shot, they'll burn the house down. Finally, my uncle calmed down

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:39.040
[Guest]: and he came back. And after a bit of stone pelting and they destroyed the car which was

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:46.000
[Guest]: parked outside, the windscreen, everything was shattered. Our glass windows were, even

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.200
[Guest]: the first floor window, the study which used to face the main road and which used to be

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:57.680
[Guest]: my favorite place to sit and look at the road and the traffic. It was very badly damaged.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:05.120
[Guest]: The windows were crashed, the stones had landed inside the study, the sitting area. We had

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:13.440
[Guest]: huge glass windows. So they had kind of broken everything. So finally, after a bit of stone

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:20.880
[Guest]: throwing, I think it must have lasted about 10-15 minutes, the crowd dispersed. And then

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:27.280
[Guest]: at that point, my call got through and somebody answered from the SSP's house. And they said,

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:32.840
[Guest]: the SSP didn't come on the line. Probably he was busy because there were riots going

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:37.920
[Guest]: on all over the city. So somebody answered the call and they said, we'll send a patrol

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:44.800
[Guest]: party to your house, which came very late in the night, well past 10.30 or so. So my

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.040
[Guest]: uncle and my father went to speak with the policemen and they said, no, no, we'll include

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.680
[Guest]: your house in our nightly rounds, so nothing will happen. Don't worry, go to sleep. Obviously,

01:08:54.680 --> 01:09:04.520
[Guest]: we couldn't have slept with so much of fear all around. And then next morning, there was

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:12.920
[Guest]: a police cordon and search operation was carried out in that mahalla where my uncles were.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:20.720
[Guest]: And all men, and they didn't distinguish between men and boys, they were rounded up and taken

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:28.280
[Guest]: away. So my cousin, who's six years younger than me, he was also picked up. He must have

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:39.120
[Guest]: been 13 or something. And fortunately, there was an elderly constable who took pity on

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:46.840
[Guest]: him or he probably recognized him from belonging to this family. So he allowed him to jump

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.520
[Guest]: from the jeep when it was turning on the main road. And from there, he walked to our house

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:59.480
[Guest]: and informed us that this is what has happened. So my uncle and my mother and I, we, because

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:06.160
[Guest]: by this time I was studying to be a journalist and I had assumed the role of a reporter already.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:15.080
[Guest]: So I tagged along and we went to the house and it was absolutely quiet. There was no

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:21.200
[Guest]: noise at all. And this was a house which was always so noisy. People were screaming on

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:27.200
[Guest]: top of their voices. There was no privacy for anything. And it was absolutely eerie.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:34.440
[Guest]: There was no noise, no sound. So we opened the door, my mother pushed the door and it

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:40.120
[Guest]: opened into that central courtyard. And there were things strewn all over. There was a television

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:47.000
[Guest]: set, there was a cricket bat, there was a lot of things lying there. And my mother obviously

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:55.920
[Guest]: in total panic, she screamed my auntie's name. And they were all huddling in one of the storerooms,

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:05.720
[Guest]: in the ground floor room. So they came running out and everybody was crying. And then they

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:12.360
[Guest]: narrated how the police had come early in the morning and taken everybody away. My father

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:21.520
[Guest]: and my uncle, they went round to various places. My father went to the DIG's office, but my

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.880
[Guest]: uncle went to another, the local police station and they kept denying that anything like this

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:33.120
[Guest]: had happened. But finally, my father managed to speak with the DIG and he said, nothing

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.240
[Guest]: will happen. I assure you that your brothers will come back. They came back late in the

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:47.360
[Guest]: afternoon and they were quite badly bruised. All the men from the neighbourhood, they came

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:52.560
[Guest]: back in the course of the night and the next morning. They were even badly hurt. A few

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:59.360
[Guest]: were hobbling and probably some had broken bones. Fortunately, my uncles didn't have

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:04.120
[Guest]: any broken bones, but they were bruised. They were hit on their calves and on their backs

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:12.640
[Guest]: by batons or something. So they had all those blue and black belts on their backs. And my

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:22.400
[Guest]: younger uncle had a cut on his forehead, very close to the eyelid. So that was a very harrowing

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:33.160
[Guest]: thing because all of us kind of got together and was wondering that you think that if you're

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:42.160
[Guest]: living in a mixed community, you would be secure because it's upper middle class society

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:50.560
[Guest]: or a colony where people of a certain class live. So it will be insulated from petty roadside

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:57.040
[Guest]: violence, but that doesn't happen. And then you think that in a Muslim mohalla, everybody

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:02.520
[Guest]: is a Muslim, so you have security in numbers. But then if the police gets after you, then

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:08.400
[Guest]: even that is no longer secure. Probably a mohalla is secure from a riot because a mob,

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:14.280
[Guest]: a Hindu mob will not enter a mohalla thing because of preponderance of Muslim population.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:20.640
[Guest]: But what do you do if the police enters? So basically, if you have to be targeted, if

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:26.680
[Guest]: there is a political directive that a particular lesson has to be taught or a few hours notice,

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:30.520
[Guest]: you know, it's a window of a few hours that you give, okay, just do whatever you want

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:35.920
[Guest]: and then the law enforcement will take its course. So if that kind of a thing happens

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:42.040
[Guest]: in a situation, then it doesn't matter what distance you have traveled, your education,

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:51.800
[Guest]: your financial situation, your thinking, your world view, even your modernity or progressiveness,

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:55.000
[Guest]: none of that matters at all.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I was struck by this trade-off which should not exist in the first place.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:04.240
[Amit Varma]: It should not be a trade-off. But it's a trade-off that comes up when your, you know, dad is

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.320
[Amit Varma]: thinking of shifting your family from the mohalla and you write at that point, quote,

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:13.400
[Amit Varma]: we didn't know where we would be more secure, in an upscale Hindu majority neighborhood

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:17.160
[Amit Varma]: where the privilege of the residents would throw a security blanket around us, or in

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:21.640
[Amit Varma]: a Muslim majority lower middle class mohalla where the numbers would insulate us, stop

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.400
[Amit Varma]: quote, which sort of reminds me of something that, you know, when I was chatting with Annie

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:30.120
[Amit Varma]: Zaidi in my last episode, you know, there's this poignant quote from her book about home

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:35.100
[Amit Varma]: is not just a place where you are safe, it is a place where you can be visible. And that

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:40.880
[Amit Varma]: sort of, you know, strikes me in this context. And later on, after, you know, the riot happened

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.880
[Amit Varma]: and all of this happened, you wrote, quote, in the family comprising six brothers and

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:52.240
[Amit Varma]: four sisters, these two men had most visibly shed their ghettoized Muslim identities. They

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:56.840
[Amit Varma]: were at home in the social, cultural and economic life of Agra, hobnobbing with the who's who

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:02.560
[Amit Varma]: of the city. And yet, when it came to communal division, they were nothing but Muslims, forever

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:08.360
[Amit Varma]: immigrants, forever scapegoats, stop quote. And then you talk about how, as this period

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:14.000
[Amit Varma]: progresses, and obviously Hindu nationalism is on the rise, Hindutva nationalism rather,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.200
[Amit Varma]: and you talk about, you write, quote, demonstrative religion was all around us. As a benign Ram

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.560
[Amit Varma]: Ram was replaced by the militant Jai Shri Ram, people started huddling with their own

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:27.360
[Amit Varma]: kind. A lot of business class Muslims who had stepped out of the mohallas and built

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:32.660
[Amit Varma]: swanky houses in mixed localities, returned to the smothering comforts of narrow lanes

01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:38.120
[Amit Varma]: and close minds, stop quote, which is of course, not just literal, but metaphorical. Tell me

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:43.720
[Amit Varma]: about this kind of shift that now happens because it strikes me that this is going to

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:49.160
[Amit Varma]: be the natural tendency that if I am attacked, if I am seen as another, I will obviously

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:54.680
[Amit Varma]: look for comfort from, you know, those of my own kind. So it almost makes this ghettoization

01:15:54.680 --> 01:16:02.000
[Amit Varma]: completely natural. And obviously, you know, my sort of reading of, you know, the history

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.960
[Amit Varma]: of the last couple of hundred years, and we'll discuss that in much more detail because you've

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:10.560
[Amit Varma]: written about that in your book as well. But my reading is that these fissures have always

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:16.680
[Amit Varma]: kind of existed, but it's only now that in a sense politics has caught up with culture.

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:23.000
[Amit Varma]: So is that what is happening? Is it a vicious circle? Is there this increased ghettoization,

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, what was your own response to this? And what was the response of others around

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:28.320
[Amit Varma]: you?

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:34.560
[Guest]: You know, there is, I would like to make a distinction between a Muslim majority area

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:44.440
[Guest]: and a ghetto. Now, a lot of Indian towns, they have community specific areas, which

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.920
[Guest]: have grown organically, which have developed organically in a city, like in Delhi, you

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:56.640
[Guest]: have Dajama Masjid area, or you have Nizamuddin West area, which were always part of the city.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:02.840
[Guest]: Or in Bombay, you have Muhammad Ali Road, or you have Bindi Bazaar. So Muslims have

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:07.800
[Guest]: traditionally lived here. They did not go there because they were scared of living anywhere

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:14.280
[Guest]: else. They have lived there for generations, and even rich, prosperous Muslims live there.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:19.960
[Guest]: The facilities, which other areas in the neighborhood have, are probably available to these areas

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:27.800
[Guest]: also. As an example, a ghetto would be a place like Mumbra, outside Bombay, which emerges

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:35.840
[Guest]: after an incident of communal violence, because people move there for security reasons. A

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:40.840
[Guest]: Muslim majority area, people live there not so much for security reasons, but because

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.920
[Guest]: they have lived there, they're comfortable there. The kind of people, they've grown up

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:54.400
[Guest]: there, live, are all around them. They identify themselves more as Muslims, so they're comfortable

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.240
[Guest]: with Muslims around. Their eating habits are similar, their mosque is there, so they can

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:06.000
[Guest]: go there. There's a madarsa there for the children. So it's a comfort factor. So most

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:16.240
[Guest]: small towns in India have these Muslim areas. So the mahala which I grew up was dirty and

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:21.920
[Guest]: all of that, but it was not a ghetto in the real sense of a ghetto as you find in Delhi

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:32.560
[Guest]: now in the Okhla region. Because Okhla area is a ghetto, you find this huge presence of

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:39.120
[Guest]: police there, and a policeman in plain clothes. They are basically spies, they are basically

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:45.720
[Guest]: from the intelligence agencies, they're trying keeping tabs. This is the area where, if you

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:53.280
[Guest]: have an address of Okhla or Batla House in Delhi, you are less likely to get a bank loan.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.760
[Guest]: You're not 100% not going to get a credit card. The delivery services, even a pizza

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:03.280
[Guest]: delivery is not possible. The pizza delivery boy would say, okay, you come at some point

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:09.320
[Guest]: and I'll leave the pizza there. So these are the places which are not organic to a city.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:15.260
[Guest]: These are the places that have developed because the law enforcement agencies have not acted

01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:23.640
[Guest]: on time and the government has not done anything to prevent this sort of pervasive fear from

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:32.400
[Guest]: taking grip over the people. What happened in Agra, after this incident of 1990, that

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:37.880
[Guest]: was the only Hindu-Muslim communal riot in Agra. Agra has no history of communal violence.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:43.720
[Guest]: Even during partition, there was no communal violence in Agra. So it has always been very

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:48.520
[Guest]: insulated from communal prejudice. I mean, people may have been prejudiced, but it was

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:53.680
[Guest]: never vocalized. But all this happened in the late 80s when it was being vocalized,

01:19:53.680 --> 01:20:02.080
[Guest]: early 90s, where people have started talking in this very criminally charged and harsh,

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:10.720
[Guest]: impolite, uncivil language. So this, even today, Agra has a lot of places where Muslims

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:17.720
[Guest]: live predominantly. And after the 1990 violence, a lot of Muslims who had moved to fancy swanky

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:26.400
[Guest]: places like our family, they went back. A few of them, I have heard from my brothers

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.080
[Guest]: that have returned to their houses because they didn't sell their houses. They just went

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:38.160
[Guest]: back to the family homes. They have, by the mid-2000s, 2004, 2005, when they thought that

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:46.160
[Guest]: things are getting a little better, they came back. And probably there is a political point

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:51.360
[Guest]: here because you see the government, which were in power in this period, both in the

01:20:51.360 --> 01:21:00.480
[Guest]: UP and at the center. So maybe that gave them some sort of a confidence that we will not

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:07.040
[Guest]: be subjected to violence. But all that changed again, 2014 onwards, when the fear of the

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:17.480
[Guest]: 90s has been not just reinforced, it has multiplied manifold. Because even in the 90s, when there

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:23.920
[Guest]: was violence, you feared for your life and you feared for your property for the duration

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:29.680
[Guest]: of the violence. It was a riot which went on for two days or three days. You feared

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:37.840
[Guest]: for that duration and then you rebuilt your life whichever way it was and you moved on.

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:45.120
[Guest]: What is happening now is that the fear is not limited to the duration of a riot because

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:53.540
[Guest]: now there is no riot. Now it is something which you are subjected to on a daily basis.

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:58.240
[Guest]: So you hear people saying that in public transport, we don't greet each other with Salam-o-Alaikum

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:04.400
[Guest]: because we don't want to draw attention to ourselves. Or people not carrying food from

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:13.840
[Guest]: home. A very senior surgeon told me in the book that he is scared of bringing Eid food

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:20.320
[Guest]: from his hometown when he comes to Delhi after Eid celebrations because he worries for his

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:32.320
[Guest]: family. So this fear that even privilege is no insurance was not there earlier. One of

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:37.560
[Guest]: the reasons that my family, my father thought that we will be safe because he felt confident

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:43.000
[Guest]: that we are too privileged. I mean, if we can afford to go in a five-star hotel to stay,

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:49.760
[Guest]: then you can imagine in our mind, we believe that the poor are affected. It's not people

01:22:49.760 --> 01:23:02.000
[Guest]: like us will not be affected. But that doesn't happen any longer. This divisive violence

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:12.800
[Guest]: is now indiscriminate. So when we talk about Muslims being caught between this lack of

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:23.800
[Guest]: choice about where to live, it's partly because of this normalization of prejudice. We are

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:31.800
[Guest]: not embarrassed by our prejudice anymore. We believe that what our prejudice tells us

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:40.000
[Guest]: is actually the fact. We don't even pause to consider that maybe it's nonsense. Maybe

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:48.840
[Guest]: it's just something which we've heard or it's hearsay. Because of this, you hear instances

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:53.320
[Guest]: of Muslims not finding accommodation. But again, it's a big city phenomenon. I don't

01:23:53.320 --> 01:24:00.160
[Guest]: think in a small city like Agra, Muslims live everywhere. It's unthinkable. I've never come

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:07.920
[Guest]: across anybody telling me that they were not able to find accommodation in a place which

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:15.360
[Guest]: was predominantly non-Muslim. So this is a big city place where probably the size of

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:21.040
[Guest]: the city, the insecurity which a big city instills in you, the economic challenges which

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:32.960
[Guest]: it imposes upon you, maybe it is all driven by that. For want of anything else, you channel

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:40.800
[Guest]: or you channelize your dislike for a certain group of people. So you deny them equal opportunities,

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:48.280
[Guest]: you deny them accommodation, you deny them civility. So what is the choice then? Then

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:58.520
[Guest]: they have to go and look for a place in a ghetto, even if they don't get along with

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:05.760
[Guest]: that sort of Muslim population, even if they're forward-looking educated people. I'll give

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:11.640
[Guest]: you an example. When I first came to Delhi as a student, I lived as a paying guest with

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:18.400
[Guest]: a Muslim family for a year and then I moved into my own flat. My father rented a flat

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:24.160
[Guest]: in South Extension. Now South Extension was in Delhi, is a South Delhi area. I don't know

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:29.800
[Guest]: how familiar you are with the Delhi social hierarchy of places. So it's a reasonably

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:36.600
[Guest]: fancy place and with hardly any Muslims there. I had no problem finding accommodation there

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:43.360
[Guest]: and then I moved to another place. I lived in rented accommodation for nearly 11 years

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:51.360
[Guest]: before we bought an apartment here. I never had any problem finding a rented accommodation

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:57.440
[Guest]: and all my landlords were non-Muslims and nobody ever asked me to vacate the flat. I

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:03.840
[Guest]: mean I moved for, because of my jobs, I moved from one place to another and I changed three

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:10.140
[Guest]: apartments and in each I lived for nearly three to four years and I never had any problems.

01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:14.960
[Guest]: Nobody told me don't cook non-vegetarian food, nobody said anything. But when my cousins

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:27.520
[Guest]: came in 2007 and they came from an even smaller town than Agra, they came from Menpuri and

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:32.320
[Guest]: they couldn't find accommodation. Every time they would approach a broker, they were told

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:41.320
[Guest]: go to Batla House, go to Okla. They did manage to live in East Delhi but with great difficulty.

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:46.760
[Guest]: Finding accommodation for them was always a huge struggle and even if they did find

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:51.080
[Guest]: accommodation within a year or so, the landlord or the landlady used to pester them to vacate

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:55.560
[Guest]: the place because things have changed so much.

01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:00.520
[Amit Varma]: That's a very subtle distinction that you drew between a ghetto and a Muslim majority

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:06.920
[Amit Varma]: area. I mean I was just using it in a general kind of sense but I find that that distinction

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:15.120
[Amit Varma]: that you made is important because it also tells you a little bit about why it has kind

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:22.120
[Amit Varma]: of formed and for what I've seen happening in India over the last couple of decades and

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:25.600
[Amit Varma]: what you alluded to where people are more open with their prejudices, where they are

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:30.320
[Amit Varma]: expressing their prejudices while earlier they would hide it. The sociologist Timur

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:37.160
[Amit Varma]: Kuran wrote a book in 1999 called I think Public Lies and Private Truths where he coined

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:42.160
[Amit Varma]: this phrase called preference falsification and one of the illustrations he gave was Soviet

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:47.480
[Amit Varma]: Union where what happened was that everybody hated the state but nobody could say it because

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:51.400
[Amit Varma]: a neighbor could you know tell on them. So they would keep it to themselves and that

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:56.600
[Amit Varma]: was preference falsification and then one day suddenly the floodgates opened and everybody

01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:02.080
[Amit Varma]: found that hey everybody thinks like me and what took place was what Kuran calls a preference

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:07.400
[Amit Varma]: cascade where suddenly everybody was free to express what they felt about the state

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:13.240
[Amit Varma]: and almost overnight the Soviet Union kind of collapsed and there seems to be like one

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:20.640
[Amit Varma]: of the reasons I think you know Modi came to power and so strongly and took such a stronghold

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:26.960
[Amit Varma]: is that there has been a preference cascade now is that many people were what I call closet

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:32.200
[Amit Varma]: bigots that many people had these prejudices they would not express it in polite society

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:36.640
[Amit Varma]: because hey you know you thought that it won't go down well and all of that but then you

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:40.960
[Amit Varma]: reach this turning point where you realize that you know the majority thinks like you.

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:45.560
[Amit Varma]: It's okay in fact not only can you say these horrible things but they will win you brownie

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.940
[Amit Varma]: points like you described listening to that speech of BP Singhal that that's probably

01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:55.680
[Amit Varma]: an early manifestation of that but today you know if you look at our politics you don't

01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:00.680
[Amit Varma]: need dog whistles anymore you know people will openly say things which they could only

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:06.160
[Amit Varma]: have alluded to in the past and as for what is happening in our cities and of course in

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:10.880
[Amit Varma]: Mumbai this is well documented various journalists over the years have done stories on how it's

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:16.320
[Amit Varma]: hard for Muslims or single people or women or whatever to rent kind of flats in Mumbai

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:20.960
[Amit Varma]: so I have a sort of larger question that I've thought about in the past I don't know even

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:24.880
[Amit Varma]: know if it's a question or a lament and it's really for all my listeners to comment on

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:31.520
[Amit Varma]: as much as for you is that you know if you look at the level of an individual flat owner

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:36.480
[Amit Varma]: right she has a right to give her flat to whoever she wants so she can say that I want

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:40.160
[Amit Varma]: people of my community only or I want people who won't cook non-veg because hey it's my

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:46.520
[Amit Varma]: flat I don't like it and so on and so forth and at an individual level these individual

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:53.320
[Amit Varma]: decisions get made but when we are a society with such prejudices then the overall outcome

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:58.580
[Amit Varma]: can be really bad the overall outcome can be this sort of cloistering of different communities

01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:04.360
[Amit Varma]: in different areas which actually exacerbates these prejudices because then if you're a

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:08.680
[Amit Varma]: you know a good vegetarian Hindu growing up in a middle-class household you're never encountering

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:12.480
[Amit Varma]: another Muslim because they don't live anywhere around you and the prejudices deepen and they

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:18.160
[Amit Varma]: become worse now you know this is not possible to police for and I don't think you know the

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:23.240
[Amit Varma]: state should use coercion to sort of decide what people do with their individual flat

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:28.320
[Amit Varma]: so it's a bunch of individuals making rational decisions which leads to an absolutely horrible

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:34.160
[Amit Varma]: social outcome and the only way out therefore to me it would seem is that you have to change

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:39.120
[Amit Varma]: it at the level of society where people feel differently about this but right now we are

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:44.240
[Amit Varma]: stuck in this very bad equilibrium where there is where we are in a vicious circle there

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:49.600
[Amit Varma]: is distrust and hate on all sides so I don't know the way out so it's not a question it's

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:56.320
[Guest]: probably a lament do you have any thoughts on this you know I had heard Kefi Azbi at

01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:05.760
[Guest]: one of the Mushairas this was in the mid 90s and he said that if every Muslim has four

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:11.360
[Guest]: or five Hindu friends and every Hindu has at least one or two Muslim friends this whole

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:16.400
[Guest]: communal problem will end because then you get to see one another you get to grow up

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:21.560
[Guest]: with one another and understand each other this is why I earlier when I was referring

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:29.360
[Guest]: to my exposure to Hindi literature and Urdu literature because I realized that this Ganga

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:36.520
[Guest]: Jamni that now has become a very bad word for a certain group of people this was a living

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:43.440
[Guest]: reality it was not just limited to going to a festival to somebody's house it was something

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:49.680
[Guest]: which was very organic to you you did not look at people by their religion you saw them

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:56.360
[Guest]: by as your neighbor or you saw them as your business colleague or as a partner business

01:31:56.360 --> 01:32:01.840
[Guest]: partner or a shop where you trust the shop owner and you always buy your groceries from

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:10.020
[Guest]: him or a vegetable vendor so it was very natural kind of intermingling of communities without

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:16.040
[Guest]: any thought about a person's religion religion was in a private space even the namaz the

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:22.000
[Guest]: azan which now has started bothering people nobody ever thought it was bothering them

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:30.000
[Guest]: this five times a day call through a loudspeaker it was very organic to a city nobody minded

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.520
[Guest]: it and nobody ever thought that it was impinging in their private or personal space or the

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:41.440
[Guest]: jagarans nobody thought anything about it but now all of these have become irritant

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:50.160
[Guest]: and all of them have become irritants to a degree that people relate their old grievances

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:54.400
[Guest]: linked to this that oh we've been suffering this for years but you did not they did not

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:59.960
[Guest]: suffer this they they did not even notice it it was so much part of your life so this

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:04.800
[Guest]: is what is happening now what you just said that if you don't give your house you don't

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:10.400
[Guest]: get to see another muslim this is also true of muslims see if you're forcing muslims to

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:15.960
[Guest]: live in a ghetto then these muslims they do not see people from another community so you

01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:21.960
[Guest]: are driven by your own prejudice but you are in turn also helping another community develop

01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:29.640
[Guest]: their own prejudices there are people in the okla or area or batla house area the jamia

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:36.560
[Guest]: area who never encounter a non-muslim at all in their lives they they are born in that

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:41.400
[Guest]: area and they go to the local hospital there where the childbirth happens they go to the

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:46.200
[Guest]: local school there then they go to the college or an institute or whatever there if they

01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:51.240
[Guest]: don't if they can afford to go to the university they go to the jamia university or if they

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:58.640
[Guest]: can't afford that then they just get into the workforce uh in that area so their exposure

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:05.920
[Guest]: to anybody outside the community is minimal so while you are trying to insulate yourself

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:13.600
[Guest]: from the outsiders you think they are dirty or they are oppressors or we have suffered

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:20.920
[Guest]: for thousands of years because of them but you are actually imperiling yourself even

01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:26.000
[Guest]: further because instead of you trying to understand them and them trying to understand you you

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:32.040
[Guest]: are actually furthering this distance even more so your prejudice is getting reinforced

01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:37.000
[Guest]: but the other person's prejudice is also getting reinforced and add to that other person's

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:43.720
[Guest]: prejudice is also genuine grievance for not getting a fair chance a genuine complaint

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:53.560
[Guest]: that the law enforcement agencies the are biased towards them so these are or these

01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:58.760
[Guest]: should be matter of concern for any country that you are dispossessing a huge chunk of

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:06.000
[Guest]: your population how can you even imagine that despite this dispossession you can still develop

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:11.920
[Guest]: you can still grow you can your GDP will grow when such a huge chunk of your population

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:17.440
[Guest]: is disaffected it is not part of your mainstream it is not contributing to your mainstream

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:25.640
[Guest]: this human resource is being is uh underemployed it is not being harnessed uh for nation building

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:31.720
[Guest]: how do you even imagine that you can still manage to do well with this in fact if you're

01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:36.400
[Amit Varma]: talking of human resources not just a minority community it's all women basically the way

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:40.920
[Amit Varma]: women are like second class citizens in india and can't you know reach their true potential

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:45.600
[Amit Varma]: and you know i had done in a sort of an episode with anchal malhotra a very moving episode

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:50.440
[Amit Varma]: and partition and you know one of the thoughts that came to us while we were in conversation

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:56.280
[Amit Varma]: there was this difference between the abstract and the concrete that when we speak of all

01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:01.840
[Amit Varma]: this hatred that is there within people all this animosity towards the other as it were

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:07.080
[Amit Varma]: all of it is in an abstract realm in the concrete realm they can be perfectly good people they

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:11.920
[Amit Varma]: can be friendly they can be assimilative and all of that but in an abstract realm that's

01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:17.000
[Amit Varma]: where all these concepts like nationalism and you know hindu purity and that sense of

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.040
[Amit Varma]: historical victimhood though they have never been victims themselves all of that comes

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:26.200
[Amit Varma]: into play and therefore it strikes me that what you need really to bring people together

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:30.440
[Amit Varma]: is more of the concrete and less of the abstract and like you pointed out that if you are not

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:34.400
[Amit Varma]: exposed to the other at all if a hindu will have no muslim friends or a muslim will have

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:39.680
[Amit Varma]: no hindu friends then there is none of that concrete where you know you can just look

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:43.320
[Amit Varma]: across the table and you see someone just like you and therefore the abstract concept

01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:49.160
[Amit Varma]: doesn't matter so much and and that's kind of a little tragic and if anything it's you

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:57.000
[Amit Varma]: know outside our elite bubbles i think it's only increased you know over the years see

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.600
[Guest]: there's another thing here sometimes we are so happy and we know that our abstract is

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:12.080
[Guest]: actually a bubble it's so vulnerable to a hard gaze that we do not even question what

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:17.320
[Guest]: we have inherited the prejudice that we are living with because we know if we look at

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:25.880
[Guest]: it or if we question it it'll all come crashing down because there's no basis to it it's just

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:32.000
[Guest]: probably a insecurity that has been fanned for so long that it has become some sort of

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:44.240
[Guest]: a concretized stone on your heart or in your mind or it's it's probably just economic vulnerability

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:49.840
[Guest]: you just feel so insecure in your own self that you feel that if i share this space with

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:55.600
[Guest]: somebody else probably this opportunity will be taken away from me so that could be one

01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:01.960
[Amit Varma]: of the reasons yeah that's a fascinating point i mean in a poor country you know people

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:05.920
[Amit Varma]: tend to think more in zero-sum ways because there is scarcity you know otherwise of course

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:10.280
[Amit Varma]: all human interaction is positive sum you know i buy something from you both of us benefit

01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:14.000
[Amit Varma]: that's why we are having that transaction but where there is scarcity where there are

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.200
[Amit Varma]: limited opportunities and resources there people tend to think of it as a zero-sum game

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:23.480
[Amit Varma]: if somebody else wins something that means you have lost which you know goes into many

01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:28.280
[Amit Varma]: other contexts apart from just money and i guess that is again one factor that could

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:33.640
[Amit Varma]: have be fueling this in a country like india we'll take a quick commercial break now and

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:38.180
[Amit Varma]: when we come back you know we've spoken so far about sort of your personal impressions

01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:42.520
[Amit Varma]: and your life and all of that over this period of time but your book is also a fabulous book

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:47.000
[Amit Varma]: of scholarship you know there's so much i learned about the history of islam in india

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.720
[Amit Varma]: though i'm fairly well read in history but there were a lot of things which i hadn't

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:54.120
[Amit Varma]: known earlier which i'd really love to get into but let's take a quick commercial break

01:38:54.120 --> 01:39:01.760
[Amit Varma]: and after that we shall continue this conversation long before i was a podcaster i was a writer

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:06.920
[Amit Varma]: in fact chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog india uncut

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:12.360
[Amit Varma]: which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time i love

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:17.800
[Amit Varma]: the freedom the form gave me and i feel i was shaped by it in many ways i exercise my

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:22.160
[Amit Varma]: writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things because

01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:27.200
[Amit Varma]: i wrote about many different things well that phase in my life ended for various reasons

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:32.480
[Amit Varma]: and now it is time to revive it only now i'm doing it through a newsletter i have started

[Amit Varma]: thank you

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.800
[Amit Varma]: welcome back to the scene in the unseen i'm chatting with ghazala wahab about a wonderful

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:14.300
[Amit Varma]: and at least for me eye-opening book born a muslim which has so much of both personal

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:20.460
[Amit Varma]: experience and history and sociology about you know islam in india and and does so much

01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:25.120
[Amit Varma]: to explain where we are today and why and uh now i want to kind of talk a little bit

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:29.120
[Amit Varma]: about history because you know a lot of i mean history these days has learned a lot

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:34.360
[Amit Varma]: on whatsapp and a lot of people have this view of history that oh you know they think

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:39.120
[Amit Varma]: of how islam came to india and they only think ki chalo conquest who are temple torah all

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:44.480
[Amit Varma]: of that nonsense but it's actually a very multi-layered and heartening story almost

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:51.960
[Amit Varma]: of how islam actually did come to india it wasn't all conquest and destroying temples

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:57.120
[Amit Varma]: so tell me a little bit about you know the origins of islam i mean some versions hold

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:02.240
[Amit Varma]: that you know islam was in india at the time during the prophet's lifetime itself so tell

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:03.240
[Amit Varma]: me a bit about that

01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:13.240
[Guest]: there was a communication see communication between the arabs and south indian the malayali

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:22.000
[Guest]: area the kerala region of india so even before arabia became muslims these people were coming

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.960
[Guest]: and the trade was really a very prosperous trade when islam came during the prophet's

01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:34.440
[Guest]: lifetime also the traders were coming but the religion didn't come in real earnest at

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:41.440
[Guest]: that time because it had not started to expand beyond its territory during the prophet's

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:50.080
[Guest]: lifetime that happened after his death and with the first khalifa which was abu akr so

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:58.480
[Guest]: that is when the muslim armies or soldiers were moving out but in india because the trade

01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:03.800
[Guest]: route was already there and these traders were now muslims so when when you're coming

01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:09.920
[Guest]: by sea you're actually out of your home for months and sometimes years and sometimes you

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:16.400
[Guest]: don't even know if you're coming back so they obviously would be accompanied by some religious

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:23.160
[Guest]: people who could give them support or succor or somebody who could lead the prayer because

01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:30.320
[Guest]: in islam a prayer for men is led by a prayer leader i mean women can pray on their own

01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:35.520
[Guest]: but for men which is why the concept of going to a mosque and praying together which is

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:40.240
[Guest]: why mosques have to be huge spaces even if they're not constructed spaces they have to

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:46.200
[Guest]: be huge spaces because men are required to trade together in a congregation led by a

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:55.880
[Guest]: prayer leader so the religious preachers started accompanying these trading caravans a lot

01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:02.160
[Guest]: of people settled down there in the preachers was preaching to the local people some converted

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:08.400
[Guest]: some didn't convert but even if you didn't convert if you've just felt some sort of peace

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:14.720
[Guest]: some sort of happiness talking to a person you automatically start veering towards that

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:21.680
[Guest]: person so the early islam which came to india it came through these mendicants who would

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:29.680
[Guest]: set up a small cottage or a place outside the city zones or village or on the outskirts

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:34.400
[Guest]: and people would start coming to them because they found peace there or some sort of comfort

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:43.680
[Guest]: gradually the population in a very organic manner started growing in this entire coastal

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:50.520
[Guest]: belt the malabar belt but it was along the coastline because probably they were also

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:57.280
[Guest]: worried of going too much in the hinterland that happened over the next few centuries

01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:03.680
[Guest]: i think by the 9th century they had moved much further inside because there was a lot

01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:13.120
[Guest]: of intermarriage was happening then the king there were the paramil kings there they converted

01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:21.000
[Guest]: to islam and once the ruler converted to islam then obviously there was this huge umbrella

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:28.880
[Guest]: of royal patronage which was given to the muslim preachers so they moved further inland

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:39.040
[Guest]: and that is when this was the first cycle of islam coming into india at the same time

01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:47.600
[Guest]: there was another route sea route which was coming to kutch and this was also traders

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:52.720
[Guest]: businessmen who were coming there working there some settled down there some married

01:44:52.720 --> 01:45:00.840
[Guest]: local women the first invader was muhammad bin qasim who came but if you read tarajan's

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:10.040
[Guest]: history of in middle in india he says that he came because there was and by this time

01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:17.680
[Guest]: islam had spread to sri lanka also so there were some orphan muslim who were there in

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:23.560
[Guest]: sri lanka the parents had died and there was like a group of orphans and so they wanted

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:33.440
[Guest]: to go back to arabia so this ship was hijacked by the gujarat-based pirates and these kids

01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:43.200
[Guest]: were taken away so the caliphate then the governor of basra then he sent a damash to

01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:51.840
[Guest]: the king of this region and he said you return the kids and so there was a face-off and then

01:45:51.840 --> 01:46:00.840
[Guest]: muhammad bin qasim was tasked to go and rescue the kids so that's how he came leading a army

01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:09.240
[Guest]: and that was the first invasion but he came here he defeated the local king dahir he plundered

01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:14.680
[Guest]: did whatever and plundering was a very natural part if you're going somewhere you have to

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:19.560
[Guest]: pay for your journey to and back i mean if it doesn't make economic sense to you why

01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:28.600
[Guest]: would you go there so they he did some plundering and he returned to arabia so that was the

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:37.840
[Guest]: first invasion that happened but that invasion didn't create a empire or a dynasty or any

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:46.920
[Guest]: such thing he came he went away and this trade continued the in our perception of muslim

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:53.520
[Guest]: invaders we actually do not look at all this with so much of emphasis we look at the invaders

01:46:53.520 --> 01:47:02.200
[Guest]: from afghanistan we look at gauri and ghazni because these are the people who left lasting

01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:13.120
[Guest]: impact on the indian population the indian society but the lasting impact or even greater

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:19.360
[Guest]: impact was led left by the business community the traders but because that doesn't give

01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:29.840
[Guest]: us much room for vilification so that part or the coming of sufis and the how the how

01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:36.680
[Guest]: islam spread through sufis that part we kind of whitewash we only focus on the invaders

01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:44.600
[Guest]: but invaders was only one part of coming of islam to india and actually invaders were

01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:49.920
[Guest]: individuals who were pursuing their political ambitions they were not really ambassadors

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:55.480
[Guest]: of islam they were not coming here to spread islam so subsequently even gauri was trying

01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:01.920
[Guest]: to become a muslim you know mujahid and he made the petition to the abbasid caliphate

01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:09.880
[Guest]: and said i'm spreading islam but he was far too debauched for the caliphate to consider

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:16.520
[Guest]: him as actually a mujahid i mean he was not really islamic warrior so a lot of warriors

01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:22.760
[Guest]: also or a lot of invaders subsequently you know belatedly realized the importance of

01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:30.680
[Guest]: claiming the title of being crusaders for islam or mujahids people who are waiting jihad

01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:37.160
[Guest]: because they felt that it would accrue them some religious benefits though they were amassing

01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:42.000
[Guest]: wealth and they were completely against the principles or the key founding principles

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.800
[Guest]: of islam but they thought it would accrue them some benefits but they can carry some

01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:55.880
[Guest]: favors with the caliphate so that is how islam came to india the first empire which was set

01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:01.960
[Guest]: up here was a slave dynasty which had two prongs one was in bengal which was the bengal

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:08.680
[Guest]: sultanate and the other was established in delhi and north india which was a delhi sultanate

01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:15.120
[Guest]: so while the bengal sultanate went further east went up to assam and other parts of the

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:22.200
[Guest]: north eastern states in addition to the whole of bengal the delhi sultanate apart from north

01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:31.040
[Guest]: india they and during the reign of alauddin kilji they started moving further south so

01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:39.920
[Guest]: the first campaigns in the deccan were carried out by alauddin kilji's commander-in-chief

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:50.000
[Guest]: that i'm forgetting the name kafur whatever his name is malik kafur so interestingly these

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:57.600
[Guest]: were the afghan people of afghan origin but with a lot of persian influences so these

01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:08.120
[Guest]: were not arabs the islam which people in kerala and parts of karnataka tamil nadu even the

01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:15.440
[Guest]: slight the northern conk and belt the the kind of islam that they were familiar with

01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:22.440
[Guest]: or they were practicing was the arabized islam which came to the arab traders but when malik

01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:30.440
[Guest]: kafur's campaign succeeded and he conquered these territories so there was this amalgamation

01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:42.200
[Guest]: of persianized afghan central asian sort of culture language food and there was this arabized

01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:48.520
[Guest]: sort of a thing so if you see this belt there was a confluence of both these influences

01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:55.160
[Guest]: which is why the islam practiced in the southern part of india is very distinct from what we

01:50:55.160 --> 01:51:02.240
[Guest]: do in north india there's a very clear i mean not only language and culture but even to

01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:09.080
[Guest]: some extent in what they believe to be religious practices so there's a difference because

01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:14.680
[Amit Varma]: they came from so many different ways all very fascinating and your book is a really

01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:19.600
[Amit Varma]: good account of the multiple ways in which you know islam came into india like you pointed

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:25.560
[Amit Varma]: out that trade was the predominant way to begin with that you know the muslims who came

01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:30.480
[Amit Varma]: to malabar gujarat were really the arabs and whatever happened in the north later the north

01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:35.920
[Amit Varma]: was perhaps trade plus some conquest even the conquest there was not so for the purposes

01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:41.080
[Amit Varma]: of religious domination it was a lot of it was political you just want to plunder and

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:44.880
[Amit Varma]: in fact the reason that so many temples were destroyed was not because they are hindu temples

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:50.520
[Amit Varma]: or whatever but because they are a symbol of whichever the local ruler is his dignity

01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:54.920
[Amit Varma]: or prestige and you want to wipe that out and one of the sort of interesting points

01:51:54.920 --> 01:52:00.680
[Amit Varma]: you you quote the historian tara chand from his book influence of islam on indian culture

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:06.160
[Amit Varma]: so i'll just quote you quoting him where he writes quote henceforth muslim influence grew

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:10.000
[Amit Varma]: rapidly they were welcomed as traders and apparently facilities were given to them to

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.600
[Amit Varma]: settle and acquire lands and openly practice their religion they must have entered upon

01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:19.320
[Amit Varma]: missionary efforts soon after settling down for islam is essentially a missionary religion

01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:25.080
[Amit Varma]: and every muslim is a missionary of his faith many were undoubtedly held in respectful esteem

01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:28.480
[Amit Varma]: before the ninth century was far advanced they had spread over the whole of the western

01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:33.280
[Amit Varma]: coast of india and had created a stir among the hindu populace as much by their peculiar

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:38.080
[Amit Varma]: beliefs in worship as by the zeal with which they professed and advocated them stop quote

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:42.820
[Amit Varma]: and a little later you write something which leads me to my next question where you write

01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:46.960
[Amit Varma]: quote their pace of growth was more rapid in the south as compared to the western central

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:52.040
[Amit Varma]: regions primarily because there was great religious social and political turmoil in

01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:55.820
[Amit Varma]: southern india during the eighth and ninth centuries there was a tussle for supremacy

01:52:55.820 --> 01:53:00.580
[Amit Varma]: between hinduism buddhism and jainism in addition the old kingdoms were in disarray in the face

01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:05.800
[Amit Varma]: of new claimants to power into this situation islam appeared upon the scene with a simple

01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:11.840
[Amit Varma]: formula of faith well-defined dogmas and rights and democratic theories of social reorganization

01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:15.880
[Amit Varma]: it produced a tremendous effect stop quote and my questionnaire is this that you know

01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:23.040
[Amit Varma]: when i read this i was sort of thinking about the power of narratives in cultural dominance

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:30.320
[Amit Varma]: and one of the things that struck me here is that people are drawn to simple narratives

01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:34.560
[Amit Varma]: complex narratives are too complex as it were they want simple explanations of the world

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:39.080
[Amit Varma]: and it strikes me that islam what it would have provided with its certainties with this

01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:43.680
[Amit Varma]: linear strand of what happens where and you don't have a hundred gods and you don't have

01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:49.320
[Amit Varma]: all of that would have provided a simple narrative which you can immediately understand and internalize

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:54.520
[Amit Varma]: as opposed to its competitors and i say its competitors because you know there is a school

01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:59.540
[Amit Varma]: of thought that hinduism is not some monolithic thing as we know it today that was partly

01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:04.720
[Amit Varma]: a construct of you know when the british came their early interlocutors were the apakas

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:08.760
[Amit Varma]: brahmins and the apakas brahmins sold them this version of hinduism as you know the varna

01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:14.080
[Amit Varma]: system and the manusmriti hinduism basically and they extrapolated that to the whole subcontinent

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:18.640
[Amit Varma]: but actually there were many many many different traditions within hinduism and they would

01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:25.600
[Amit Varma]: all have been very complicated and all of that and islam comes along and one you are

01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:29.720
[Amit Varma]: supposed to be zealous about spreading the faith and two you've got a really simple narrative

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:34.120
[Amit Varma]: like one of my and i'm not making a value judgment on simple narratives one way or the

01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:38.000
[Amit Varma]: other that they are necessary sometimes they are good sometimes they are misleading like

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.800
[Amit Varma]: i once speculated that one of the reasons trump won in 2016 was he had a simple narrative

01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:47.080
[Amit Varma]: it was wrong but it was simple and sometimes that's an important thing and perhaps you

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:50.880
[Amit Varma]: could argue the dispensation and power in india has a simple narrative as well it's

01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:54.640
[Amit Varma]: wrong but simple you know it doesn't embrace the complexities do you think there's something

01:54:54.640 --> 01:55:01.360
[Guest]: to that i agree islam had a very simple narrative added to that simple narrative was a very

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:09.520
[Guest]: laid down structured form of practicing of religion so there were five pillars very easy

01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:15.800
[Guest]: to remember one was the kalma which every which just two lines that you memorize it

01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:21.000
[Guest]: and the kalma itself is proclamation of your religion that okay i am a muslim now so even

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.480
[Guest]: today if a person has to convert to islam all he has to do is recite the kalma and you

01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:31.200
[Guest]: are converted there is no ritual happening there is no process of becoming a muslim it's

01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:37.280
[Guest]: as simple as reciting of a kalma then you have prayers five times a day again very simple

01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:43.800
[Guest]: and the prayer times are fixed what the first prayer is that before dawn then there is just

01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:49.760
[Guest]: before the noon hour that is zawal period then you have pre-dusk then you have dusk

01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:57.480
[Guest]: and you have night prayer very simple laid down prayer time then similarly ramzan you

01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:05.040
[Guest]: have a month in a year where you fast from dawn to dusk very simple no complication and

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:12.760
[Guest]: hajj if you are able-bodied if you're financially solvent you can do it you go for hajj and

01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:18.160
[Guest]: the most important is zakat now again zakat is a such a noble thing to do that anybody

01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:24.960
[Guest]: would be would really believe and rightly so that a good part of your faith is helping

01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:30.160
[Guest]: others so now there's an integral to faith that you have to help others it's not a choice

01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:38.280
[Guest]: you're not uh it's not left to an individual's judgment so these were the five pillars now

01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:42.720
[Guest]: over the years what has happened you have islamic jurisprudence you have this law that

01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:48.280
[Guest]: law all that is later edition but when you're appealing to a non-muslim this is these are

01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:57.960
[Guest]: the five pillars very simple systematic way of becoming a muslim and if you see this it's

01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:06.240
[Guest]: not even very complicated to practice i mean now hardline muslim ulemas would insist that

01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:14.200
[Guest]: you do prayer in a particular way you have to bend in a particular way but traditionally

01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:19.760
[Guest]: nobody interrupted in the way you practice your religion the biggest factor in favor

01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:26.280
[Guest]: of islam at that point which would have appeared to people who were converting then was lack

01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:33.960
[Guest]: of clergy absence of clergy there was no religious leader that you had to go to there was nobody

01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:40.480
[Guest]: who would tell you with authority or impose upon you his or her writ that this is how

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:48.160
[Guest]: you have to do it islam sunni islam said it is between you and your allah so you do whatever

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:53.680
[Guest]: you want to do as long as your conscience is clear nobody has any business to interrupt

01:57:53.680 --> 01:58:01.600
[Guest]: or tell you that you're doing something wrong so in a society where you had such rigid clergy

01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:06.360
[Guest]: it's not just india i mean even uh in the entire christian world where you had such

01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:14.720
[Guest]: rigid clergy and when people were expected to be uh referential towards the clergy defer

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:22.480
[Guest]: to their vims and their orders uh spend so much money uh in keeping the clergy happy

01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:35.800
[Guest]: so this looked like a very simple and humane sort of a religion where you're also factoring

01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:41.880
[Guest]: in looking after a fellow muslim you know there's an islamic saying which is not part

01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:46.720
[Guest]: of the quran but it is part of the islamic saying that every muslim is responsible for

01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:56.360
[Guest]: uh 40 households in his neighborhood so 10 in each direction so if uh even one person

01:58:56.360 --> 01:59:02.280
[Guest]: in this neighborhood of 40 households that every person is responsible to dies of starvation

01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:08.720
[Guest]: that sin is upon you how was it that you didn't come to know that somebody was hungry so if

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:16.560
[Guest]: each is responsible for 40 uh so it's it's a cycle it's a circle uh which kind of grows

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:24.960
[Guest]: so with this sort of uh approach and then the sufis very uh selfless poor people who

01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:30.800
[Guest]: want nothing for themselves they live in uh poor circumstances they hold these open kitchens

01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:37.240
[Guest]: for people to feed people every day all this is very appealing you know as a person you

01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:44.040
[Guest]: would just get drawn to something which appears so selfless so the politics of the religion

01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:50.000
[Guest]: uh it surfaced much later i mean there was a lot of politics of religion even in arabia

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.960
[Guest]: at that time but when you're reaching out to people this politics doesn't show itself

01:59:54.960 --> 02:00:03.880
[Guest]: you show yourself uh with your best foot forward and this is what it how it appears to people

02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:08.760
[Amit Varma]: yeah and and you know in the popular imagination these days people will look upon uh those

02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:14.240
[Amit Varma]: sort of years of you know slave dynasty followed by the mughal dynasty and all of that as mughals

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:18.640
[Amit Varma]: are coming and they've subjugated the local people but that was far from the case uh whoever

02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:23.520
[Amit Varma]: might politically have been in charge uh the you know muslims and hindus work together

02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:28.640
[Amit Varma]: at all times like shivaji had muslims who worked for him and the mughals had uh hindus

02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:33.680
[Amit Varma]: and rajputs and all of that uh uh and all the you know armies were mixed at a very memorable

02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:38.160
[Amit Varma]: episode with manu pillay on this which i'll link from the show notes and you know you

02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:44.240
[Amit Varma]: sort of uh talk about how this mingling of uh islam and hinduism which led to what you

02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:49.800
[Amit Varma]: call quote a distinctively regional syncreticism stop quote was almost inevitable and and i'll

02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:55.400
[Amit Varma]: again quote from your book uh quote muslim authority had also to impose itself impose

02:00:55.400 --> 02:01:00.160
[Amit Varma]: upon itself other restraints employment of the hindus was a necessity of their rule mehmood

02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:05.400
[Amit Varma]: of ghazni had a numerous body of hindu troops who fought for him in central asia and his

02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:11.040
[Amit Varma]: hindu commander tilak suppressed the rebellion of his muslim general niyati jin when kutubuddin

02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:15.120
[Amit Varma]: abug decided to stay in hindustan he had no other choice but to retain the hindu staff

02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:19.400
[Amit Varma]: which was familiar with the civil administration for without it all government including the

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:23.560
[Amit Varma]: collection of revenue would have fallen into utter chaos the muslims who came into india

02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:27.760
[Amit Varma]: made it their home they lived surrounded by the hindu people and a state of perennial

02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:33.280
[Amit Varma]: hostility with them was impossible mutual intercourse led to mutual uh understanding

02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:38.400
[Amit Varma]: uh stop quote and and and obviously you know i've had episodes on akbar as well and the

02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:43.960
[Amit Varma]: mughals in general and and you see this syncreticism every day in our culture in our food where

02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:48.420
[Amit Varma]: we have influences from everywhere in the clothes that we wear i mean uh prime minister

02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:53.600
[Amit Varma]: modi's elegant churidar kurtas are of course you know without the mughals they wouldn't

02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:59.440
[Amit Varma]: have been there so all of this is very fascinating and at this time there's another strand that

02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:04.720
[Amit Varma]: is emerging that is particularly appealing to even non-religious atheists like me which

02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:11.560
[Amit Varma]: is sufism which is so fascinating and and also becomes extremely popular in the subcontinent

02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:16.760
[Amit Varma]: almost uh sort of a default way of many people to think about the religion so tell me a little

02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:24.920
[Guest]: bit about that strand and how it came up see uh sufi uh the emergence of this uh strand

02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:32.520
[Guest]: of sufis or this group of sufis was as old as the religion itself a lot of people tend

02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:38.840
[Guest]: to think of sufism as a sect or as islamic sect but actually it was not sufis were just

02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:45.640
[Guest]: a group of people who believed in uh following the religion in a particular manner i have

02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:52.320
[Guest]: drawn a comparison between the sufi and ulema ulema was a more dogmatic sort of a person

02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:59.720
[Guest]: which emerged uh much later with the rise of the caliphate and the earliest caliphate

02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:06.040
[Guest]: but uh sufis were there during the prophet's lifetime itself and they used to be the people

02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:14.280
[Guest]: who would be constantly lost in prayer and meditation and with no desire of worldly pleasures

02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:22.160
[Guest]: so this has evolved concurrent to islam uh in fact in early years there was no distinction

02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:32.640
[Guest]: between a regular muslim ulema or a sufi or a maulvi or a sufi because everybody was finding

02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:38.080
[Guest]: the religion for themselves and everything was acceptable the early muslim scholars have

02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:44.840
[Guest]: actually said that you cannot judge who is following the correct path to islam as long

02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:53.880
[Guest]: as your principle of your basics are in order as long as you are devoted uh to the first

02:03:53.880 --> 02:04:00.920
[Guest]: karma which is there is no god but allah and muhammad is his prophet so if you are if you

02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:07.040
[Guest]: adhere to this basic principle you can find various ways of reaching the almighty so sufism

02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:20.480
[Guest]: basically is part of this uh tradition when uh this in south arabia after uh there was

02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:26.400
[Guest]: this preponderance of uh sufis and they had established their khankhas and they were challenging

02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:36.280
[Guest]: uh the ulemas these hard core so-called islamic elite of learned people who were who had memorized

02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:43.720
[Guest]: the quran by heart who were working on islamic laws who were qualifying islamic laws uh that

02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:49.840
[Guest]: was the time when they realized that more and more people were drifting to the sufis

02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:55.960
[Guest]: because they found the sufis more approachable as opposed to the ulema ulema would be this

02:04:55.960 --> 02:05:00.920
[Guest]: learned person and obviously if you think you are learned and you know better a certain

02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:07.840
[Guest]: degree of arrogance comes and then this expectation of subservience comes into you so as opposed

02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:15.160
[Guest]: to these uh the sufis were very simple people so a lot of people uh would still veer towards

02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:20.480
[Guest]: the sufis instead of coming to the ulema for their problems so that was the time when they

02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:26.440
[Guest]: started uh vilifying the sufis started telling calling them names saying they're un-islamic

02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:32.840
[Guest]: they are actually outside the pale of islam and the vilification started happening so

02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:39.520
[Guest]: once they were pushed out of uh saudi arabia not saudi i keep saying saudi arabia arabia

02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:47.080
[Guest]: there was no saudi then once they were pushed out so then they moved into territories like

02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:55.200
[Guest]: persia they moved into turkey and central asia and india that is how it came in india

02:05:55.200 --> 02:06:00.720
[Guest]: and uh at one point i am forgetting i have mentioned it in the book uh there was something

02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:08.040
[Guest]: like 10 to 12 various sufi orders uh in various parts of the country in fact one very interesting

02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:17.960
[Guest]: sufi order was in kashmir which was uh you know a mix of uh the shahwaites and the muslims

02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:24.640
[Guest]: so uh and they worked with both and both uh the hindus and the muslims were devoted to

02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:31.200
[Guest]: this sufi order uh but the most popular sufi order in india has been the chishti order

02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:39.440
[Guest]: uh which was started by uh munuddin chishti in ajmer and despite the fact that uh muslims

02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:47.160
[Guest]: a lot of muslims uh hardliners the conservative ulema vilified them they called them names

02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:52.560
[Guest]: and said they are not islamic at all and the whole practice of sufism is against islam

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:59.360
[Guest]: because it encourages idol worship because when you're going to a sufi's mazar your act

02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:05.040
[Guest]: it is considered that you are worshiping the mazar which is not correct it's it's uh it's

02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:11.280
[Guest]: a wrong uh interpretation of what people do there despite that their popularity has not

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:22.720
[Guest]: waned even today despite the growth of hardliners within islam despite this whole wahhabism

02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:29.200
[Guest]: the influence of the sufis has not diminished not just in india but you see even in a country

02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:37.880
[Guest]: like pakistan where there has been a really concerted violence against sufis their dargahs

02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:43.120
[Guest]: are still so popular which is why they are places of targeted violence because people

02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:49.040
[Guest]: still congregate there during wars and they still believe that this is where they'll find

02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:57.960
[Guest]: peace this is where they'll their problems will be mitigated so sufi and one of the biggest

02:07:57.960 --> 02:08:05.960
[Guest]: factors of spread of islam in india has been the sufis even today if you visit a dargah

02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:12.120
[Guest]: though now uh it's there are very few dargahs where you actually get a sense of peace and

02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:20.120
[Guest]: calm because there's so much of chaos and so many people there and a lot of non-religious

02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:25.440
[Guest]: activities happen there in terms of forcing you to contribute money to this cause that

02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:34.160
[Guest]: cause uh to the extent of being extortionist but despite that a lot of non-muslims still

02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:44.520
[Guest]: visit the sufis and a lot of non-muslims have such faith in the resident sufis at various

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:52.920
[Guest]: dargahs or people who profess sufism that they treat them like a family advisor they

02:08:52.920 --> 02:09:00.280
[Guest]: consult them for family matters so it's not just muslims so i think uh sufism has been

02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:07.520
[Guest]: the biggest driver of islam in this region south asian region so there's uh you know

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:12.480
[Amit Varma]: one of my favorite bits in this book is this legend which you uh cite and i'll i'll quote

02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:16.400
[Amit Varma]: that entire paragraph and come to a question that i have associated with it uh where you

02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:21.680
[Amit Varma]: write quote there is a famous legend associated with the greatest woman sufi ever hazrat rabia

02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:26.680
[Amit Varma]: of basra who died in 801 ce once she was found running in the desert with a torch in one

02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:31.480
[Amit Varma]: hand and a pitcher of water in another when somebody stopped her to ask what she was doing

02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:36.040
[Amit Varma]: she replied that she intended to burn paradise with a torch and douse the flames of hell

02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:41.160
[Amit Varma]: with water so that people would love god for the sake of god and not for want of paradise

02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:47.040
[Amit Varma]: or fear of hell stop quote and this is so beautiful and what it also sort of seems to

02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:53.520
[Amit Varma]: be um almost a subtweet against as it were by current terminology or what it seems to

02:09:53.520 --> 02:10:00.320
[Amit Varma]: also um argue against is the transactional nature of religion how conditional the love

02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:05.760
[Amit Varma]: of god can be for uh people you know like at the basic level it's of course do this

02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:08.920
[Amit Varma]: otherwise you'll go to heaven or otherwise you'll go to hell and do this and you'll go

02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:15.360
[Amit Varma]: to heaven and blah blah blah but you know christopher hitchens in one of his um screeds

02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:18.960
[Amit Varma]: against organized religion i think this was in the context of christianity but can hold

02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:23.800
[Amit Varma]: true for so many others uh wrote about how you know it's basically bribery you you have

02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:27.120
[Amit Varma]: a god who's threatening you that if you don't do all of this shit if you don't believe in

02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:33.520
[Amit Varma]: me and me only you're in deep trouble and sufism seems to strike away from this and

02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:39.400
[Amit Varma]: and you know like i did an episode on nanak panthi with amardeep singh last year at some

02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:43.680
[Amit Varma]: point in time and it strikes me that guru nanak was also in his original sayings and

02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:48.400
[Amit Varma]: the following he built around him like a sufi in a sense it's the same kind of thing where

02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:51.920
[Amit Varma]: you don't need to give it a name but it's like you love god and therefore humanity for

02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:56.400
[Amit Varma]: the sake of it but there is there are no rituals involved there's no bribery there's nothing

02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:02.120
[Amit Varma]: transactional and the thought that strikes me here is that i see the appeal of something

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:06.320
[Amit Varma]: like this like even to someone who doesn't believe in god like me there's a lot of appeal

02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:10.800
[Amit Varma]: of sufism and nanak panthi and you know strands like this the bhakti movement strands like

02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:14.760
[Amit Varma]: this which are not dogmatic and which don't have rituals and all that associated with

02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:22.200
[Amit Varma]: it but yet at the same time we see that there is you know growing extremism in all the religions

02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:27.160
[Amit Varma]: where more and more people seem to be drawn towards those extreme ends towards all these

02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:33.360
[Amit Varma]: rules don't do this don't do that and all of that and that in fact you know seems dominant

02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:37.040
[Amit Varma]: today though that could just be the availability heuristic and maybe it's just this period

02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:42.920
[Amit Varma]: in time and we'll be living in a sufi world 100 years from now but right now that's what

02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:48.440
[Amit Varma]: it seems to me that people get drawn to these harsh dogmatic othering aspects of religion

02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:55.880
[Amit Varma]: rather than to those sort of impulses that sufism seems to attract what are what are

02:11:55.880 --> 02:12:00.040
[Guest]: your thoughts on this see there are two ways of approaching the religion any religion one

02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:06.920
[Guest]: is fear and another is love so what the sufis were doing they said uh you your religion

02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:12.520
[Guest]: should be premised on your love for god what the ulemas or what the dogmatics were doing

02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:19.320
[Guest]: that it should be based or it should be premised on fear which is why you hear even among muslims

02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:26.880
[Guest]: ki khuda ka khauf karo and khauf karo ka yehi hai ki aap jo bhi kaam kar rahe hain aap

02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:34.800
[Guest]: dar ke kar rahe hain the reason why it appears to us and that sufism kind of lost out to

02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:44.480
[Guest]: this more extremist form of islam was basically dar khauf is always greater than love i mean

02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:54.680
[Guest]: love is such a simple and harmless emotion that it it can never stand up to fear if the

02:12:54.680 --> 02:13:02.440
[Guest]: fear of extreme consequences is so huge that you cannot reason out now what has happened

02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:13.400
[Guest]: in uh amongst the muslims apart from this fear of god once uh the codification of islamic

02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:20.440
[Guest]: laws was happening once the the sayings or habits of the prophet were being written down

02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:27.680
[Guest]: as hadith or treaties the documents of his life was being written down in black and white

02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:33.880
[Guest]: people started to treat all of this as par uh at par with uh religion itself that these

02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:41.280
[Guest]: are the things which are ordained by god and we have to believe into this because eventually

02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:48.160
[Guest]: as i said uh politics also gets into religion basically religion in my opinion is a amalgamation

02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:54.320
[Guest]: of a number of things it's faith it's culture it's history it's your family traditions it's

02:13:54.320 --> 02:14:02.320
[Guest]: your fear it's your superstition and it's politics so uh faith alone cannot make a religion

02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:11.440
[Guest]: so islam was probably faith or what uh prophet muhammad was saying was a very simple uh simplistic

02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:17.480
[Guest]: faith which i had mentioned earlier uh and which is what appeals to a lot of people but

02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:22.920
[Guest]: when the religion of islam was being formed then they took into account all these things

02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:29.680
[Guest]: and then political power or political control over people was very very essential which

02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:39.720
[Guest]: is why you see the rules the regulations like uh blasphemy came about uh now islam or quran

02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:45.360
[Guest]: has absolutely nothing to say about blasphemy i mean you can say whatever you want ideally

02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:51.640
[Guest]: you should not i mean it's bad behavior that you are uh calling somebody names but uh it

02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:58.360
[Guest]: was not punishable there was if there was no offense in this but when the uh the politics

02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:05.480
[Guest]: became part of religion because when the muslim empire was being built uh the first was uh

02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:11.320
[Guest]: the the first uh caliphate i'm forgetting the name now uh and the second basit so when

02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:17.200
[Guest]: these uh caliphates came and they realized that they are now an empire they have their

02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:22.160
[Guest]: armies marching all over the world i mean they're right there at the doorstep of spain

02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:28.040
[Guest]: on one side and they're here in central asia on the other so the political power had to

02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:34.360
[Guest]: come from only fear i mean you uh have to control the people through fear that then

02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:40.640
[Guest]: love cannot work you cannot ask a huge mass of people to follow you because they should

02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:48.600
[Guest]: love you so that is how the ulemas the dogmatic ulemas were cultivated encouraged because

02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:58.680
[Guest]: they help the political power they help the rulers to uh enforce their writ and the more

02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:05.640
[Guest]: rigid you become the more power you feel because then you're you're restricting a individual's

02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:11.600
[Guest]: agency over his or her life you keep telling him that this is wrong and you'll rot in hell

02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:17.720
[Guest]: this is wrong you'll be burnt in hell so when you are playing on a person's insecurities

02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:25.700
[Guest]: to this extent you tend to then look for ways which will guarantee you at least some place

02:16:25.700 --> 02:16:33.440
[Guest]: in some corner of paradise so this whole idea of your own agency your whole own individual

02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:41.160
[Guest]: approach to religion uh was unacceptable because even one person saying that i do not agree

02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:48.040
[Guest]: with you and i will do what i wish to do is disruptive it just disrupts your whole setup

02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:54.840
[Guest]: that you have built of power of religious power political power all enmeshed together

02:16:54.840 --> 02:17:02.920
[Guest]: so this is something which uh was absolutely unacceptable and progressively as more and

02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:10.720
[Guest]: more muslim rulers came they took away the agency of individuals further from them which

02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:17.040
[Guest]: is why there was a time when even secular education was frowned upon because they realized

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:23.720
[Guest]: that if you are exposed to education if you are exposed to different ideas you may start

02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:30.920
[Guest]: thinking for your own and which is why then the seljuk dynasty came and they said no we've

02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:38.000
[Guest]: established this group of madarsas the whole idea was that religious education is enough

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:44.400
[Guest]: when the quran says that education learning is important it means that only islamic learning

02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:49.420
[Guest]: religious learning is important you need not learn anything else so the cascading effect

02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:57.240
[Guest]: of this has been that a lot of muslims felt that for them learning about islam is enough

02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:02.560
[Guest]: to see through this life and they need not learn anything else if you're not exposing

02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:08.120
[Guest]: your mind to new ideas if you're not challenging yourself then obviously it leads to some sort

02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:13.360
[Guest]: of a intellectual atrophy your capacity to think generation on generation reduces because

02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:21.320
[Guest]: you're not using your brain you're not using your uh intellect and this is once you have

02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:31.720
[Guest]: these pygmy people uh intellectual pygmies then it is easier to herd them you know like

02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:37.480
[Guest]: a flock of cattle you can just tell them go here go there do this and that is where your

02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:43.480
[Guest]: whole idea of islamic exclusivism islamic extremism i'm not talking of violence i'm

02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:47.680
[Guest]: just talking about extremism in the sense that you feel that you're superior you're

02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:52.920
[Guest]: different from others you feel that you have to be even more dogmatic i mean it is not

02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:57.240
[Guest]: enough you're praying five times a day now you also need to do extra prayers you also

02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:02.200
[Guest]: need to do penance prayer it is not enough that you're doing uh you're fasting 30 days

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:08.720
[Guest]: in a month uh you have to do additional fasting and a lot of muslims actually uh fast through

02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:14.320
[Guest]: the year uh every week or every fortnight there's some fast or the other because the

02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:19.560
[Guest]: five basic principles are no longer enough they need more and more rigidity in their

02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:28.120
[Guest]: faith to feel that they are better and closer to heaven than others yeah all very fascinating

02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:32.640
[Amit Varma]: and and you've described this beautifully in your book where you first talk about islam

02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:37.360
[Amit Varma]: becoming more and more extreme in kind of a global uh sense and then how that comes

02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:42.640
[Amit Varma]: to india like you've written about you know the pushback to this coming from uh ibn tamiyyah

02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:47.560
[Amit Varma]: and then from muhammad ibn abdul wahab the whole wahhabi movement and you quoted from

02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:53.000
[Amit Varma]: this book called the two faces of islam by stephen schwartz and you write quote uh abdul

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:58.160
[Amit Varma]: wahab said schwartz made no secret of his opinion that all muslims had fallen into unbelief

02:19:58.160 --> 02:20:03.120
[Amit Varma]: and that if they did not follow him they should all be killed their wives and daughters violated

02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:09.000
[Amit Varma]: and their possessions confiscated shias sufis and other muslims he judged unorthodox were

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:14.320
[Amit Varma]: to be exterminated above all uh wahab and his followers despised music which they viewed

02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:20.440
[Amit Varma]: as an incitement to forgetfulness of god and to sin many sufis by contrast use music as

02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:25.320
[Amit Varma]: a means to heighten consciousness of god uh stop quote and later you know you have this

02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:31.440
[Amit Varma]: section on indian muslim sects like deobandis barelvis uh ala hadith and so on and you talk

02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:35.880
[Amit Varma]: about how they all quote owe their theological development to the vast repertoire of shah

02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:41.880
[Amit Varma]: waliullah and wahab uh stop quote and it seems to me to be like two sort of parallel strands

02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:45.920
[Amit Varma]: which are happening here one is that all of these sects which you describe of course come

02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:51.680
[Amit Varma]: from wahhabism and they have this exclusionary view and uh therefore uh you know you will

02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:57.120
[Amit Varma]: have the mullahs around having these uh extreme views which kind of feeds into the vicious

02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:01.760
[Amit Varma]: circle at the other side it strikes me like the question is often asked that why are indian

02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:08.040
[Amit Varma]: muslims not as extreme as muslims in certain other parts of the world who are who are more

02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:14.160
[Amit Varma]: radicalized though i would you know continue to stress that muslims are the biggest victims

02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:19.440
[Amit Varma]: of terrorism worldwide including what is called islamic terrorism so we should kind of keep

02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:25.040
[Amit Varma]: that in mind and not paint with uh too much of a broad brush but yet indian muslims haven't

02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:29.360
[Amit Varma]: uh been radicalized to that extreme and it seems to me that one reason for that would

02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:36.120
[Amit Varma]: be that a lot of indian islams has sort of you know imbibed the those sufi kind of traditions

02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:41.480
[Amit Varma]: and not uh you know the radical kind of islam that comes from these sects that you describe

02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:46.920
[Amit Varma]: so tell me a little bit about this uh how through the centuries this tension has played

02:21:46.920 --> 02:21:52.160
[Amit Varma]: out between uh the lived islam of many people which takes more from sufism and is like chilled

02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:59.640
[Amit Varma]: out and musical and all of that and with the more radical kind the more political kind

02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:07.280
[Guest]: see the as i mentioned the radical islam basically was a pushback against this uh growth of sufis

02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:12.440
[Guest]: and the influence that sufis were building over the muslim mind okay i'll go a little

02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:19.720
[Guest]: back in the history when uh after the death of prophet muhammad the first khalifa was

02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:26.920
[Guest]: appointed he came from a very powerful koresh tribe now this koresh tribe was opposed to

02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:34.080
[Guest]: the prophet uh when he was propagating islam and these early battles of islam were between

02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:42.360
[Guest]: the koresh and prophet muhammad and his followers but when the koresh embraced islam then they

02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:49.440
[Guest]: feel they retained their political power which they in any case had earlier also so the first

02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:55.760
[Guest]: three khalifas were from the koresh and this only reinforced their power and this is when

02:22:55.760 --> 02:23:02.760
[Guest]: the codification of laws started the fourth was uh hazrat ali who was a prophet's uh nephew

02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:09.680
[Guest]: and son-in-law so uh he was from his tribe which was not koresh so this political power

02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:16.720
[Guest]: when it was vested in this koresh tribe and they were trying to uh and after ali's assassination

02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:25.120
[Guest]: it went back to the koresh because uh muhaviyah who assumed uh caliphate after ali's assassination

02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:32.320
[Guest]: was also from the same tribe uh so this they were conscious of the fact that they're not

02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:39.120
[Guest]: regarded as noble as the earlier caliphs were or uh ali's had ali had a huge reputation

02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:45.840
[Guest]: i mean even today all the dargahs and everywhere you go uh it's ali's uh name which is invoked

02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:52.560
[Guest]: you know ya ali madad or ali maula you hear sufi music it's uh his name is invoked because

02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:59.920
[Guest]: he had such a he had captured the muslim mind in such a huge way that uh the subsequent

02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:08.160
[Guest]: uh khalifas they are caliphs they realize that they do not have that spiritual legitimacy

02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:16.560
[Guest]: so the office of a caliph was then uh bifurcated the political power vested in the person who

02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:23.200
[Guest]: assumed the caliphate and it became hereditary and the uh spiritual power was vested in the

02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:29.040
[Guest]: ulema this is something which happened when saudi arabia came about when ibn wahab met

02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:35.000
[Guest]: with the ibn saud and they said okay let's divide this country i'll control the religious

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.040
[Guest]: part of this i'll control the islamic part of it you control the political part so it

02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:46.480
[Guest]: was like a compact so the early evidence of this compact was during the reign of the hereditary

02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:52.400
[Guest]: caliphs now caliphs originally were supposed to be elected by the people but once it became

02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:57.160
[Guest]: a non-elective it became a hereditary and it became an empire then they felt that there

02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:04.160
[Guest]: was a need to have a religious a powerful religious person who would kind of ensure

02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:12.880
[Guest]: that the people remain devoted to the uh the ruler the and religion is i mean as we see

02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:19.720
[Guest]: in india today also religion is a huge motivator i mean nothing binds people together uh more

02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:26.240
[Guest]: strongly than a religious directive from some kind of a religious head so that is how these

02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:33.360
[Guest]: ulemas were being cultivated they became a conduit between the people and the ruler and

02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:39.880
[Guest]: because they were now on the payroll of the ruler so they were not representing the people

02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:45.560
[Guest]: to the ruler they were representing the ruler to the people so their job was to uh tell

02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:49.880
[Guest]: the people that what this guy is doing what the ruler or the khalifa is doing is correct

02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:57.000
[Guest]: this is islamic and this is islamic uh sanction for this various fatwas were being issued

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:04.080
[Guest]: and the moderates or people who were deemed as somebody who could question them were increasingly

02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:11.040
[Guest]: put outside the veil of islam this harassment this uh targeted um pushing them out of the

02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:16.360
[Guest]: society or ostracizing them all this started happening around this time so all through

02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:22.760
[Guest]: uh and this started within two centuries of prophet's death i mean it was not so bad as

02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:29.240
[Guest]: it became in the 15th century onwards after ibn tahmiyyah onwards but this division had

02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:37.320
[Guest]: started to come then this was also the time that uh now quran is a book of reference it

02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:44.320
[Guest]: has verses it has some prayers it has a lot of things uh it has some some guidance or

02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:49.760
[Guest]: some direction to how a person should be leading a honorable life but it doesn't have law so

02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:55.200
[Guest]: what we call islamic law is actually not part of the quranic law quran just gives you direction

02:26:55.200 --> 02:27:00.400
[Guest]: the only issues which it really addresses with a lot of force is uh divorce marriage

02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:07.120
[Guest]: and divorce and usury and all that so there are few things which it addresses uh very

02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:18.000
[Guest]: forcefully the other things uh crime punishment all this are suggestions so this was left

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:24.640
[Guest]: to uh i mean the quran didn't say that rules should be made but when the rulers came and

02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:29.320
[Guest]: the empires were being built and they felt that they needed a uniform islamic community

02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:35.960
[Guest]: like a ummah so the laws were being codified based on what they understood of the quran

02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:40.760
[Guest]: so these ulemas who were sitting down and writing islamic laws they started interpreting

02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:46.700
[Guest]: the verses and they started laying down the law writing down the law in great details

02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:55.040
[Guest]: so this is actually because these were from arabia these are arabs so a lot of their interpretation

02:27:55.040 --> 02:28:03.280
[Guest]: stemmed from their own historical uh background what they have their own lived and experienced

02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:09.720
[Guest]: their own tribal culture their practices so that kind of crept in uh the laws so what

02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:15.440
[Guest]: we see uh in islam they say that if somebody if a person steals you cut off his hand or

02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:24.920
[Guest]: uh uh you stone a person so this is not there uh this is not really a divine law this is

02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:29.160
[Guest]: a law which has been codified subsequently because this is with the tribal practices

02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:36.220
[Guest]: so this these practices obviously have to evolve with times but unfortunately most countries

02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:43.240
[Guest]: have their own laws but i'm just using this as an illustration to say so when you're trying

02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:50.120
[Guest]: to dominate or rule or govern a huge mass of population you needed very rigid laws so

02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:58.760
[Guest]: that the fear of law and fear of god could be instilled in the people so for that sufis

02:28:58.760 --> 02:29:05.380
[Guest]: were a liability because they were saying that there's nothing to fear if you've done

02:29:05.380 --> 02:29:12.160
[Guest]: no harm no harm will come to you so that is how this whole tradition with you know of

02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:18.800
[Guest]: sufism veering away from the classical or dogmatic slum started happening this cleavage

02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:25.040
[Guest]: kind of widened and widened why this did not happen so much in india until recently until

02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:31.440
[Guest]: the late 80s not it is until recently actually in late 80s the process started uh was because

02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:38.600
[Guest]: uh unlike the popular narrative slum did not come to india through uh the clergy or through

02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:47.360
[Guest]: the uh rulers it came through largely traders whose interest was very uh small-time business

02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:54.040
[Guest]: you know just wanted to live their life and earn a living and be happy or sufis so our

02:29:54.040 --> 02:30:02.680
[Guest]: uh slum that we imbibed here and sufis also ensured that a lot of local traditions were

02:30:02.680 --> 02:30:08.360
[Guest]: married into their islamic practices which is why in india you find a very not just india

02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:15.440
[Guest]: if you go to indonesia also it's a very rooted geographically rooted kind of a religion you

02:30:15.440 --> 02:30:23.380
[Guest]: have not completely alienated yourself from your geography from uh the customs traditions

02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:33.360
[Guest]: of your ancestors so it's a very nice balanced amalgamation of history faith culture and

02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:41.960
[Guest]: what you think today is pragmatism so that is probably one of the reasons why uh indian

02:30:41.960 --> 02:30:48.800
[Guest]: muslims had no reason to get radicalized to the extent as you see in certain parts of

02:30:48.800 --> 02:30:58.320
[Guest]: the middle east and north africa unfortunately in the 80s when a lot of muslims started going

02:30:58.320 --> 02:31:04.040
[Guest]: to the gulf for job and see this is again i'm coming back to the thing my earlier point

02:31:04.040 --> 02:31:10.240
[Guest]: that if you are pushing a group of people a large mass of people out of the mainstream

02:31:10.240 --> 02:31:16.780
[Guest]: because of your own prejudice then they have to find some ways of surviving so because

02:31:16.780 --> 02:31:22.920
[Guest]: of this prejudice was okay not so vocal then but discrimination was still there so a lot

02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:28.520
[Guest]: of muslims who were not getting jobs in the mainstream who were not finding employment

02:31:28.520 --> 02:31:35.640
[Guest]: at par with their educational levels they started looking for opportunities abroad and

02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:40.960
[Guest]: the big opportunities opened with the discovery of oil with the in the middle east and a lot

02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:46.800
[Guest]: of muslims started going there so these people when they were exposed to that sort of a religious

02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:53.160
[Guest]: practices and in a sharp contrast to their very laid-back amorphous sort of a belief

02:31:53.160 --> 02:32:01.400
[Guest]: that you do whatever you do they realized that very clear-cut principles of islam very

02:32:01.400 --> 02:32:06.720
[Guest]: clear-cut formula that you must do this you must do that and anything which is made harder

02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:13.600
[Guest]: it looks more real i mean unless religion is hard to follow what is the point of following

02:32:13.600 --> 02:32:21.640
[Guest]: it so these people when they came back they brought that sort of uh rigidity with them

02:32:21.640 --> 02:32:29.720
[Guest]: so that is how you find a lot of uh muslims now not being content with the islam they

02:32:29.720 --> 02:32:36.640
[Guest]: have been following and they want to follow a more arabized form of islam and uh but thankfully

02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:43.680
[Guest]: even this has not led to radicalization for the simple reason their roots of the local

02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:50.840
[Guest]: elements are too strong for them to really veer off track completely so let's again now

02:32:50.840 --> 02:32:56.640
[Amit Varma]: go back to uh history before we come to the current day the one sort of the the til the

02:32:56.640 --> 02:33:00.200
[Amit Varma]: thing i had absolutely no idea of the one thing i learned from your book was the importance

02:33:00.200 --> 02:33:06.240
[Amit Varma]: of 1857 like of course we know the importance of the 1857 rebellion in terms of what it

02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:11.920
[Amit Varma]: did for the freedom movement and colonialism in india and all of that but it was also a

02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:18.480
[Amit Varma]: big factor sort of the later hindu muslim divides that happened the british played a

02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:24.520
[Amit Varma]: role in that 1857 had so much of a wider resonance that i had not known anything about that so

02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:33.120
[Amit Varma]: tell me about that why was 1857 so uh important even in uh sort of this uh particular context

02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:40.200
[Guest]: see 1857 though a lot of people had risen against the british power they did it under

02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:45.520
[Guest]: the mughal emperor now the muslims felt that this will restore the muslim power back in

02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:51.120
[Guest]: india if you recall this is it was a period where muslim power or the mughal empire was

02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:58.840
[Guest]: actually only notional i mean bahadur shah zafar had no writ outside his own uh fort

02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:03.400
[Guest]: the marathas were controlling large tracts i mean even before the british it was already

02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:09.880
[Guest]: empire on its last leg so a lot of muslims thought that this would restore the muslim

02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:16.080
[Guest]: power now power is associated with glory it's associated with the influence and a lot of

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:21.760
[Guest]: things so they they were fighting the british for that they were fighting the british to

02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:28.800
[Guest]: reclaim their lost power lost glory the non-muslims the hindus were fighting to throw the british

02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:35.440
[Guest]: out or their own grievances against them because of various policies of usurping territories

02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:43.880
[Guest]: like jhansi and other places so they had different motives but once this uh war was given a color

02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:52.800
[Guest]: of jihad and which is understandable because jihad religion as i said is a huge motivator

02:34:52.800 --> 02:34:59.440
[Guest]: so a clarion call for war uh usually if you have a religious call then more people get

02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:08.840
[Guest]: motivated to go do and die type so when this happened a lot of hindus especially the business

02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:16.040
[Guest]: community of delhi the rich money lender community uh the traders of delhi which were all hindus

02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:24.480
[Guest]: uh they were jari of what was happening and a lot of them had started thinking okay that

02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:29.480
[Guest]: is let this bloodletting happen between the muslims and the british and we'll see which

02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:35.200
[Guest]: side wins and then we'll take our sides i will reveal our cards then so once this was

02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:42.760
[Guest]: happening uh and there was mass killing of muslims reports came out people i mean it's

02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:48.780
[Guest]: not difficult to hide that who was telling on them who was the informer who was talking

02:35:48.780 --> 02:35:55.560
[Guest]: behind their backs or who was supplying equipment or money to the british so this deepened the

02:35:55.560 --> 02:36:01.800
[Guest]: fissure now uh the other thing was the british themselves were because of the history of

02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:10.040
[Guest]: uh rebellion in various of colonies from north africa to other parts and the long history

02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:16.760
[Guest]: of crusades which have been like really really uh harrowing bloodletting between the muslims

02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:23.000
[Guest]: and the christians so they in any case had a very deep prejudice against islam uh if

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:29.960
[Guest]: you recall even today much much before the vilification of islam started in india it

02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:36.280
[Guest]: used to happen in the west and even today this whole characterization of islam as a

02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:42.520
[Guest]: primitive religion caricaturing of the prophet it happens in the west more than it happens

02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:49.880
[Guest]: in india because probably there is some sort of rebellion now that defines that why should

02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:54.280
[Guest]: we listen to them if they're offended let them be offended but it also stems from the

02:36:54.280 --> 02:37:02.120
[Guest]: fact of their history so a lot of this desire to offend is also a desire to humiliate it

02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:11.040
[Guest]: comes from that so in uh that was the time when they started uh cultivating this notion

02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:21.120
[Guest]: of muslims as uh uncivilized barbaric people this whole idea or this whole narrative of

02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:30.680
[Guest]: victimhood uh was cultivated by them and imbibed by the hindus who suddenly thought who found

02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:36.560
[Guest]: themselves uh that muslims are no longer the rulers so the british they kind of became

02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:42.240
[Guest]: allies with them against the muslims and they felt that with this we can regain our power

02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:49.080
[Guest]: in any case they were better educated because muslims traditionally did not uh imbibe secular

02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:58.160
[Guest]: education so their influence on the society was largely through uh music poetry art culture

02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:04.400
[Guest]: it was not through education so when the british came and the modern society was being shaped

02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:10.440
[Guest]: so muslims were outside the pale and hindus were employed uh in high positions across

02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:20.000
[Guest]: the board so uh that further created the fissures and facilitated this narrative a hindu narrative

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:26.680
[Guest]: of victimhood of centuries of victimhood to grow and develop and there was no counter

02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:33.880
[Guest]: to this narrative because uh the intellectual capacity of the muslims was so weak uh despite

02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:38.760
[Guest]: the fact that the mughal courts had historians they had writers but all that was in the past

02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:49.400
[Guest]: by the middle by the early 19th century uh they were actually very badly off intellectually

02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:56.360
[Guest]: or financially uh the only thing they had was culture but how far could culture go yeah

02:38:56.360 --> 02:39:02.520
[Amit Varma]: no it's like just to kind of sum it up and you can tell me if i'm processing it uh correctly

02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:06.880
[Amit Varma]: the 1857 revolt was interesting because number one radical muslims saw it as a chance to

02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:12.120
[Amit Varma]: appropriate the struggle and uh sort of go at the forefront you know it was fought under

02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:17.320
[Amit Varma]: the banner of the mughal emperor so to say so uh you know muslims came along and and

02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:21.640
[Amit Varma]: the british sees this you know this was a great opportunity to divide and rule you've

02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:26.400
[Amit Varma]: spoken about how they fanned the narrative of hindu victimhood which again has a colonial

02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:31.480
[Amit Varma]: beginning in a sense as far as narratives go or at least a colonial propulsion at this

02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:35.800
[Amit Varma]: point and are you right as far as the ordinary muslims are concerned you're right quote the

02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:40.280
[Amit Varma]: muslims felt let down by their leaders cheated by their hindu neighbors and disillusioned

02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:44.360
[Amit Varma]: by their faith they had believed the ulema who told them that as in the historic battle

02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:48.840
[Amit Varma]: of badr allah would intervene to ensure the victory and so as a defeated people tend to

02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:54.080
[Amit Varma]: do they became dependent and inward looking and then you write about how quote the ulema

02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:57.580
[Amit Varma]: were quick to turn this to their advantage they claimed that while the muslims cause

02:39:57.580 --> 02:40:02.520
[Amit Varma]: was just their faith was weak hence the faith needed to be strengthened stop quote and you

02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:07.720
[Amit Varma]: write about how all these sort of uh sects inspired these sunni muslim sects inspired

02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:12.680
[Amit Varma]: by wahhabism like the devbandis and barelvis were a consequence of you know grew in power

02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:17.520
[Amit Varma]: at this point and you write as a result ordinary muslims started shrinking away from the national

02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:22.840
[Amit Varma]: mainstream increasingly identifying with the idea of the global ummah besides his development

02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:27.960
[Amit Varma]: one of the effects of the 1857 revolt was the erosion of the economic and educational

02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:32.760
[Amit Varma]: foundations of the muslims stop quote and this of course has a cascading effect you

02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:36.520
[Amit Varma]: know one of the prominent muslim leaders we remember in our history from that period is

02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:40.440
[Amit Varma]: of course saeed ahmad khan who started the oligarh muslim university later and all of

02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:45.040
[Amit Varma]: that but you point out that how he was almost a minority figure within his community in

02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:50.000
[Amit Varma]: the sense that you know people just turned away from that kind of secular education they

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:55.440
[Amit Varma]: turned away from modernity and that is a sort of a trend that has continued ever since in

02:40:55.440 --> 02:41:01.920
[Amit Varma]: india tell me a little bit more about that and also my other sort of related question

02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:07.920
[Amit Varma]: is that what then seems to happen at this point or what at least comes into stark relief

02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:13.040
[Amit Varma]: at this point is the dual notion of the ummah on one hand and the nation on the one hand

02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:18.640
[Amit Varma]: where you can ask you know where does a muslim belong if i am a muslim am i an indian or

02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:23.760
[Amit Varma]: do i belong to the larger muslim ummah and am i looking to sort of the caliphate for

02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:29.240
[Amit Varma]: my source of identity so this is also a tension that's sort of playing out in all of these

02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:34.600
[Amit Varma]: years and has a consequence on our politics as well so tell me a little bit about these

02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:40.160
[Amit Varma]: different kinds of tensions one muslims turning away from the mainstream almost sort of in

02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:44.760
[Amit Varma]: an intellectual sense ghettoizing themselves as it were and and then these growing conflicts

02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:51.440
[Guest]: between ummah and nation i'll answer the second one first see this is a misconcept and again

02:41:51.440 --> 02:42:02.000
[Guest]: a part of the vilification which started with the british in and around the 1857 revolt

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:08.880
[Guest]: that muslims there is a ummah they are not subservient to the regime they are not they

02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:14.320
[Guest]: don't consider themselves citizens of a particular nation where they live their their loyalty

02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:23.560
[Guest]: always lies with the central figurehead of the caliph now the thing is that if you see

02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:31.520
[Guest]: in india even through the various muslim dynasties starting with the delhi sultanate there was

02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:38.200
[Guest]: no connection with the caliph so much so that during the reign of akbar he actually challenged

02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:45.720
[Guest]: a caliph in the sense that he said he was deserving of being a caliph so and india was

02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:51.880
[Guest]: never a islamic country despite this long history of a muslim rule preceding the mughals

02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:59.640
[Guest]: also it was never declared a islamic country that was one of the factors that it was always

02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:05.240
[Guest]: out of the pale of the larger muslim ummah because it was considered a country where

02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:12.640
[Guest]: majority is still not muslim so it did not qualify as a islamic country so the muslims

02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:21.760
[Guest]: in india have always been rooted in in this country uh which is another reason that though

02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:28.480
[Guest]: muslims go out for employment uh you do not see muslims settling down in a lot of foreign

02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:35.080
[Guest]: countries the majority of guys who go to the middle east for employment they work there

02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:40.280
[Guest]: they earn their living there send remittances back home and once the job is over they come

02:43:40.280 --> 02:43:46.760
[Guest]: back here you don't see that muslims are going in containers and somehow getting into canada

02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:51.920
[Guest]: or get getting into some place because just they feel that they can have a better life

02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:59.800
[Guest]: there uh even when partition happened and they were promised a muslim uh country islamic

02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:06.400
[Guest]: country majority did not go the rich went primarily because they thought they will work

02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:14.480
[Guest]: far there uh as opposed to india or as opposed to hindu india but the middle the lower middle

02:44:14.480 --> 02:44:20.160
[Guest]: class the poor they did not go because they have been so rooted to the land i'll give

02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:26.820
[Guest]: you the example of my own family we have been the most immobile family in my family nobody

02:44:26.820 --> 02:44:34.640
[Guest]: has moved anywhere in life uh physically uh we uh i grew up in agra the maximum i went

02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:41.520
[Guest]: out was uh come to delhi and live in this area my entire family we are all in and around

02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:50.080
[Guest]: agra for generations we have lived here so our this fondness of staying in a place and

02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:57.560
[Guest]: identifying that with that place identifying with that the culture of that place the food

02:44:57.560 --> 02:45:02.360
[Guest]: of that place i mean i still hanker for street food in agra people say the best street food

02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:07.320
[Guest]: is in banaras or lucknow but i keep saying no no agra is the best and i know which hawker

02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:16.040
[Guest]: sells the best stuff so uh this rootedness uh has in in india has ensured that there

02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:21.480
[Guest]: is no concept of umma no muslim looks up to anybody in any case there is no global muslim

02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:27.160
[Guest]: leadership anywhere so what is that muslim looking at or looking for you don't find any

02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:33.340
[Guest]: indian muslim forget going to palestine or forget going to afghanistan to fight uh nobody

02:45:33.340 --> 02:45:39.660
[Guest]: even raises a voice for kashmiris i mean kashmir is a part of india and kashmir has been suffering

02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:47.080
[Guest]: this roiling insurgency since 1989 and so many atrocities so much of violence has happened

02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:52.200
[Guest]: against the muslims in kashmir but uh you don't find mainstream muslim in any other

02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:58.560
[Guest]: part of india uh emphasizing with them or raising their voice in their favor so this

02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:10.200
[Guest]: muslim brotherhood is actually a concept which has been fanned by uh vested interests from

02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:16.800
[Guest]: time to time to just uh question their loyalty to the country of uh residents of the country

02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:22.520
[Guest]: uh their nation because it also helps you build a narrative of that they cannot be trusted

02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:27.520
[Guest]: that their fifth columnist their loyalty doesn't lie here as gold barker had said that

02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:35.760
[Guest]: so it it fans that it fuels this narrative which is why everybody from time to time talks

02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:42.040
[Guest]: of the muslim umma there is no muslim umma i mean each muslim from different countries

02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:51.400
[Guest]: are very distinct from another uh muslim uh uh japanese not japanese extreme example but

02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:58.160
[Guest]: a european muslim who's uh not a migrant who's not gone from north africa who's a european

02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:05.640
[Guest]: because he uh was converted while being uh in europe is very different from a sri lankan

02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:13.320
[Guest]: muslim or a bengali muslim similarly a bengali is very very different from a tamil muslim

02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:22.600
[Guest]: so they wherever they are uh they are extremely rooted in uh their geography in their history

02:47:22.600 --> 02:47:29.680
[Guest]: and in the traditions of that particular place even in terms of costume uh muslims from bengal

02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:34.080
[Guest]: would be wearing a sari in a particular fashion and muslims in tamil nadu would be wearing

02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:38.480
[Guest]: in a particular fashion but a punjabi muslim will not be wearing a sari like a punjabi

02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:44.480
[Guest]: hindu wouldn't wear a sari so this is a second part i'll come to the i'll respond to this

02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:49.320
[Amit Varma]: quickly where i completely agree with you as far as uh you know about uh uh muslims

02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:53.440
[Amit Varma]: here or in fact anywhere else for that matter being rooted in their local circumstances

02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:58.320
[Amit Varma]: and all that i completely buy that which is why it uh you know savarkar was playing such

02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:02.660
[Amit Varma]: a devious game in his toxic book hindutva where he spoke about how the only indians

02:48:02.660 --> 02:48:06.760
[Amit Varma]: are those whose motherland whose place of origin and place of worship is india and he

02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:11.560
[Amit Varma]: said muslims aren't because they owe their allegiance to mecca which was not true at

02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:16.800
[Amit Varma]: all at a social level but nevertheless there was a political strand and i'm you know specifying

02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:21.280
[Amit Varma]: political as opposed to social or cultural there was a political strand which did look

02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:26.440
[Amit Varma]: to the caliphate for example uh and it's very consequential to how our history turned out

02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:31.040
[Amit Varma]: and i'm referring of course to the khilafat movement of the ali brothers where after world

02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:36.360
[Amit Varma]: war one was over they demanded you know the khilafat movement demanded a sort of reinstatement

02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:41.040
[Amit Varma]: of the caliphate as it were and that became consequential for us because mahatma gandhi

02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:45.880
[Amit Varma]: who at that time hadn't really become the leader of the congress so to say tied up with

02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:51.120
[Amit Varma]: them as uh you know as a tactical means uh and became the leader of the congress which

02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:56.120
[Amit Varma]: caused jinnah who until that point was a great moderate leader in the congress to walk out

02:48:56.120 --> 02:49:00.440
[Amit Varma]: in disgust and say what the hell is this because it was of course incoherent because gandhi

02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:06.220
[Amit Varma]: is talking about the nation and the ali brothers are talking about the umma and the and eventually

02:49:06.220 --> 02:49:12.080
[Amit Varma]: of course that alliance fell apart but proved to be really consequential and i totally agree

02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:17.760
[Amit Varma]: with you from my limited experience and readings of course that um you know most muslims are

02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:21.960
[Amit Varma]: just rooted in their circumstances but nevertheless what is happening in modern times and this

02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:27.260
[Amit Varma]: is something that you describe later is that you have these saudi petrodollars coming into

02:49:27.260 --> 02:49:32.520
[Amit Varma]: india where uh you know they are setting up these organizations all over the place and

02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:38.800
[Amit Varma]: they are doing what like at one point in the context of asam you write a quote today the

02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:43.480
[Amit Varma]: traditional mikhla chador of asam is being replaced by so-called islamic dresses like

02:49:43.480 --> 02:49:49.360
[Amit Varma]: salwar suits or shararas complete with the hijab stop quote so at a political level there

02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:56.400
[Amit Varma]: is an effort to uh sort of go beyond uh the local specific sort of you know leave the

02:49:56.400 --> 02:50:03.600
[Amit Varma]: mikhla chador aside and put on the hijab so you know does this worry you is this increasing

02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:09.160
[Amit Varma]: is it part of the vicious circle of extremism that's kind of uh going on there are two things

02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:14.560
[Guest]: here actually you have asked two questions the first is the khilafat now see this whole

02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:22.480
[Guest]: khilafat movement uh this is exactly why i have written that muslim politician is absolutely

02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:28.400
[Guest]: irrelevant because he doesn't represent his own people so at the during the freedom struggle

02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:34.080
[Guest]: when everybody was veering towards fighting the british there was a group of uh people

02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:41.320
[Guest]: which ali brother johar uh muhammad ali johar and his brother their priority was amorphous

02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:45.720
[Guest]: concept i mean even the turks didn't want the caliphate to survive i mean they they

02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:51.720
[Guest]: were tired of it but because these ulemas i mean not ulema they were not ulemas but

02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:58.440
[Guest]: they they came from a strand of religion which was driven by ulemas uh i don't know if you

02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:04.680
[Guest]: read uh maulana azad's india wins freedom he describes uh this meeting with gandhi and

02:51:04.680 --> 02:51:11.560
[Guest]: uh where this maulana basri and all these people are there and uh ali brothers are there

02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:16.360
[Guest]: and they said our priority is that the caliphate should be restored and people like him and

02:51:16.360 --> 02:51:22.440
[Guest]: people azad and maulana azad and rafi ahmed kids by and they were perplexed they said

02:51:22.440 --> 02:51:29.800
[Guest]: but that is not our agenda our agenda is something else so even at that point these people these

02:51:29.800 --> 02:51:37.520
[Guest]: group of people they their uh worldview or their concept of what muslims should stand

02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:42.360
[Guest]: for or what muslim politics should stand for was very different from what people wanted

02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:49.000
[Guest]: which is why in the early years muslim league had no support uh they had no ground support

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:55.480
[Guest]: it was only a party of leaders and party of petitioners they didn't have ground workers

02:51:55.480 --> 02:52:00.280
[Guest]: the ground workers came only when jamaat islami aligned itself with uh muslim league that

02:52:00.280 --> 02:52:05.040
[Guest]: is when they got that street bar and they could carry out their violence and uh other

02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:12.000
[Guest]: things but as long as uh it was strong of jamaat islami they had nothing they had nothing

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:17.240
[Guest]: to stand on which is why even jinnah when he came and he drifted into muslim league

02:52:17.240 --> 02:52:23.760
[Guest]: muslim league had no base in india that base was built only once jamaat islami kadar came

02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:31.560
[Guest]: and jamaat islami kadar was in any case hugely uh dogmatic because of madhudi's uh philosophies

02:52:31.560 --> 02:52:38.040
[Guest]: in fact madhudi's influence went well beyond india even muslim brotherhood uh they uh drew

02:52:38.040 --> 02:52:44.480
[Guest]: inspiration from madhudi's writing he's supposedly the first person who has given some kind of

02:52:44.480 --> 02:52:53.200
[Guest]: a concrete shape to the concept of political islam so all this happened later uh now coming

02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:57.800
[Guest]: to the second part of your question which is that uh in assam what is happening the

02:52:57.800 --> 02:53:06.040
[Guest]: petrodollars this is what i refer to as arabization of indian islam this is again it's not radicalization

02:53:06.040 --> 02:53:15.320
[Guest]: it is actually in real sense arabization because the earliest islamists also they felt that

02:53:15.320 --> 02:53:21.280
[Guest]: because islam came to arabia so arabs were the chosen people though prophet in his last

02:53:21.280 --> 02:53:27.000
[Guest]: sermon has said that arab is not superior to anybody else and all people are equal but

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:32.480
[Guest]: arabs have always maintained their superiority even in the present-day politics their biggest

02:53:32.480 --> 02:53:39.480
[Guest]: rivalry has been with iran only not because asia sunni is one part of it the other part

02:53:39.480 --> 02:53:45.960
[Guest]: is this traditional uh rivalry that historical cultural rivalry because persia was a very

02:53:45.960 --> 02:53:53.360
[Guest]: evolved uh nation well even before islam came well before islam came whereas arabia was

02:53:53.360 --> 02:54:01.600
[Guest]: a primitive group of tribes so they really did not have a society as sophisticated as

02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:09.640
[Guest]: learned as persia had uh iran had so this rivalry uh is comes from there so when uh

02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:17.000
[Guest]: they realized that in the indian subcontinent or a lot of the central asia the persian version

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:24.720
[Guest]: of islam despite being sunnis uh their mannerism their language their literature this is becoming

02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:30.960
[Guest]: popular in fact that persian language was part of our indian uh language the court language

02:54:30.960 --> 02:54:38.600
[Guest]: well after freedom also independence also so when they this obviously was a huge inferiority

02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:45.600
[Guest]: for the arab society or arab politicians because they were feeling themselves thinking we are

02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:51.960
[Guest]: the chosen ones we should be predominant but because they had nothing to speak of no economy

02:54:51.960 --> 02:54:59.200
[Guest]: until the oil uh was found uh they couldn't do much about it so once they had the resources

02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:07.520
[Guest]: they started this export of their version of islam in great earnest and it spread rapidly

02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:14.640
[Guest]: but see in india despite this it did not come in a very violent fashion as it happened uh

02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:21.480
[Guest]: in parts of pakistan and afghanistan fortunately because again there is no umma it's just a

02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:31.560
[Guest]: very rooted geographically limited or located religion that people are imbibing arab practices

02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:38.800
[Guest]: they are trying to find a arabized version of their practice of islam whether it's in

02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:45.400
[Guest]: language and dress and saying allah hafiz or in saying ramadan and salat instead of

02:55:45.400 --> 02:55:52.280
[Guest]: rosa and namaz and so they're doing all this but it is limited as of now it is limited

02:55:52.280 --> 02:56:00.320
[Guest]: to only that it is not really translating into extremism or radicalism and uh i'm just

02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:08.640
[Guest]: leading you on uh that is also the reason that despite this whole idea of terrorism

02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:14.320
[Guest]: uh islamic terrorism in india and our government keeps saying that terrorism is the biggest

02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:21.680
[Guest]: threat to humanity i do not believe that we have terrorism is a problem in india i do

02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:28.800
[Guest]: not believe that our threat is terrorism i think it's complete propaganda yeah i mean

02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:33.520
[Amit Varma]: i agree with you it's just a no-brainer that you know we don't have that kind of terrorism

02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:38.360
[Amit Varma]: here if it's if anything it is it comes in from outside let me take you back to the other

02:56:38.360 --> 02:56:43.160
[Amit Varma]: question though which you know in on this show there are a lot of digressions because

02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:47.640
[Amit Varma]: we discuss so many things that we just jump from one to the other but the other you know

02:56:47.640 --> 02:56:53.360
[Amit Varma]: i'd ask two questions and the other one was this then tendency to look inward to become

02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:58.640
[Amit Varma]: you know after 1857 the ulemas get more extreme and they get more of a hold and you speak

02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:04.540
[Amit Varma]: about how muslim society then turn inwards it is distrustful of secular education it

02:57:04.540 --> 02:57:09.360
[Amit Varma]: buys a rhetoric that all you need to know to you know prosper in the afterlife or whatever

02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:14.580
[Amit Varma]: is knowledge of islam and the quran and all of that and that becomes um and in a sense

02:57:14.580 --> 02:57:20.160
[Amit Varma]: a modern uh sort of illustration of that is that incident you describe from your own life

02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:24.400
[Amit Varma]: where at the age of 16 while you are writing essays to get into universities abroad one

02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:29.880
[Amit Varma]: of your cousins is being felicitated for memorizing the quran so tell me a little bit about this

02:57:29.880 --> 02:57:35.760
[Amit Varma]: sort of drift and how it kind of harmed the muslim community here and i suppose it is

02:57:35.760 --> 02:57:40.080
[Amit Varma]: possibly related in some way and maybe you can expand on that but what you said earlier

02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:47.720
[Amit Varma]: also about muslim political leaders not really representing the people at large per se so

02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:52.800
[Amit Varma]: tell me a little bit about you know these two strands and the kind of marginalization

02:57:52.800 --> 02:58:03.640
[Guest]: that is resulted in see the ulemas in india have always been very conservative very dogmatic

02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:10.200
[Guest]: so it's not that they suddenly became extreme because uh the source of their islamic learning

02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:15.360
[Guest]: came from largely from shah waliullah who was exposed to this sort of islam when he

02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:21.080
[Guest]: went for hajj to arabia and he was though there's no evidence that he met up with abdul

02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:27.800
[Guest]: wahab but he was familiar with his works his writing so when he came to india he thought

02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:32.280
[Guest]: he sought to reform indian islam which he thought was had fallen on bad days because

02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:41.200
[Guest]: people were had adopted so many customs and cultures of the local people so when the indian

02:58:41.200 --> 02:58:46.720
[Guest]: ulema class developed it grew out of he he ran the very successful and very prestigious

02:58:46.720 --> 02:58:55.040
[Guest]: madarsa in delhi that madarsa rahimia so when this learned class of indian ulema came mostly

02:58:55.040 --> 02:59:01.680
[Guest]: emerged from madarsa rahimia so they were always like that what happened after 1857

02:59:01.680 --> 02:59:07.880
[Guest]: when your financial power was taken away when you were economically degraded with so much

02:59:07.880 --> 02:59:19.280
[Guest]: of loss of life and hope of future was looked very bleak so like all disillusioned all weak

02:59:19.280 --> 02:59:25.920
[Guest]: all disheartened people they try and turn to religion and they try to turn more and

02:59:25.920 --> 02:59:31.280
[Guest]: more to dogmatic and religion because it's not only comforting it's it kind of takes

02:59:31.280 --> 02:59:35.880
[Guest]: away your your attention away from your present misery because it just promises you great

02:59:35.880 --> 02:59:41.760
[Guest]: things which will happen to you in the future so this is uh what was happening to the muslims

02:59:41.760 --> 02:59:48.320
[Guest]: because there was so much in uh this area i mean the widespread bloodshed that happened

02:59:48.320 --> 02:59:54.040
[Guest]: after 1857 i mean if you read the old account it's in the north india there were villages

02:59:54.040 --> 03:00:00.780
[Guest]: which were wiped out so people at that point they had no uh way of uh you know finding

03:00:00.780 --> 03:00:05.520
[Guest]: some kind of support who could they turn to the emperor was no longer there they were

03:00:05.520 --> 03:00:15.160
[Guest]: uh rudderless they were leaderless so at that point the ulema smoothly moved into this space

03:00:15.160 --> 03:00:21.640
[Guest]: and muslims in any case had a historic tradition of looking up to a religious figurehead as

03:00:21.640 --> 03:00:27.760
[Guest]: um as a ruler because you have a history of caliphate where uh the early three uh four

03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:34.320
[Guest]: caliphs were also they were both spiritual as well as temporal leaders so for them to

03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:39.760
[Guest]: accord the leadership status to a ulema or to a group of ulemas was not very difficult

03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:48.400
[Guest]: they just thought maybe uh this is how we'll uh reclaim our lost uh glory power or whatever

03:00:48.400 --> 03:00:54.760
[Guest]: so that that is when the ulemas started wielding a disproportionate influence over the uh population

03:00:54.760 --> 03:01:03.600
[Guest]: syed ahmad khan uh was part of this delhi elite and his family had witnessed the wholesale

03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:08.180
[Guest]: massacre but because his family was aligned with the british they were in the service

03:01:08.180 --> 03:01:17.000
[Guest]: of the british so they didn't suffer the repercussions and he used his association his family's association

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:25.000
[Guest]: to get concessions from them to try start up a school for muslims that is how anglo-arabic

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:33.240
[Guest]: school then metamorphosed into the university illegal muslim university british also facilitated

03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:42.080
[Guest]: his visit to oxford and cambridge so he could see uh what how a modern university is designed

03:01:42.080 --> 03:01:51.400
[Guest]: and how it operates but uh because a large number of muslims were now closely aligned

03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:57.680
[Guest]: with the ulema uh because first mover advantage ulemas had moved first so they managed to

03:01:57.680 --> 03:02:03.680
[Guest]: get a bigger support they did not want to join the university because there was a constant

03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:08.560
[Guest]: tussle between the ulema and sir syed there were a lot of fatwas which are issued against

03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:18.000
[Guest]: sir syed uh saying that he's promoting un-islamic practices he's promoting kufr or even sin amongst

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:25.280
[Guest]: the muslims so he he was trying to convince a rich landed muslim gentry the landlords

03:02:25.280 --> 03:02:32.880
[Guest]: uh the taluk dars that you send your kids to the sons no daughters uh to my institution

03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:38.240
[Guest]: he was trying to convince the ulema that look i will ensure that they get islamic education

03:02:38.240 --> 03:02:46.200
[Guest]: which is why the whole curriculum of aligarh uh university was uh modern but islamic at

03:02:46.200 --> 03:02:50.880
[Guest]: core so their prayer they did ensure that there were prayers happening they did ensure

03:02:50.880 --> 03:02:56.680
[Guest]: that some sort of islamic dress became a uniform there that sherwani aligari pajama and all

03:02:56.680 --> 03:03:06.120
[Guest]: of that so he maintained he ensured that the cultural ethos of uh north indian upper uh

03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:14.160
[Guest]: caste and class muslim is in place and a modern education is also there which is why this

03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:19.400
[Guest]: very modern elite muslim elite emerged from the early years of aligarh university which

03:03:19.400 --> 03:03:26.760
[Guest]: eventually moved to pakistan so that was uh his contribution but then one aligarh university

03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:34.280
[Guest]: is not enough i mean even today they cater to some uh 4 000 students i mean it's it's

03:03:34.280 --> 03:03:42.440
[Guest]: a drop in the ocean and at that time it was much smaller but uh it was not only that even

03:03:42.440 --> 03:03:50.160
[Guest]: uh sayyid ahmad khan's focus in those days was on educating the elite he was not uh in

03:03:50.160 --> 03:03:59.320
[Guest]: the favor of expanding this uh doors of learning or opening these doors of learning to um lower

03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:06.480
[Guest]: class or lower caste or poor muslims as well as women he felt that women cannot be better

03:04:06.480 --> 03:04:12.200
[Guest]: or more educated than men because it will disrupt the family harmony so as long as they

03:04:12.200 --> 03:04:19.480
[Guest]: are quran literate and they are good enough to teach their kids uh the quran so it's fine

03:04:19.480 --> 03:04:30.160
[Guest]: so this conflict between so-called modernity and uh conservatism uh continued till uh for

03:04:30.160 --> 03:04:36.720
[Guest]: many years till uh leading up till the partition because if you see this early muslim leaders

03:04:36.720 --> 03:04:42.040
[Guest]: were all from this aligarh stock which is why muslim league earlier was called the aligarh

03:04:42.040 --> 03:04:49.880
[Guest]: party because it produced these early class of sophisticated muslims articulate learned

03:04:49.880 --> 03:04:56.000
[Guest]: people with fancy libraries and studies at home who would be you know who'd be so rich

03:04:56.000 --> 03:05:01.960
[Guest]: that they needn't work they would just dwell on poetry and literature and classical music

03:05:01.960 --> 03:05:10.800
[Guest]: so there was another reason why uh the influence of ulemas did not weigh even after uh independence

03:05:10.800 --> 03:05:16.200
[Guest]: because when the pushback from the lower classes and the lower castes of the muslims they it

03:05:16.200 --> 03:05:22.480
[Guest]: started i mean this upward mobility started after the partition uh these were the people

03:05:22.480 --> 03:05:26.920
[Guest]: who again the ulemas target and these are the people because of poverty are the first

03:05:26.920 --> 03:05:30.760
[Guest]: ones to go to a madrassa because at least that ensures some amount of education to the

03:05:30.760 --> 03:05:39.400
[Guest]: child so the the influence of the ulema has remained strong over uh the community until

03:05:39.400 --> 03:05:45.880
[Guest]: and unless people who have really been disruptors who have moved away uh forged their own paths

03:05:45.880 --> 03:05:51.080
[Guest]: and their own education whether in a muslim institution or a non-muslim institution and

03:05:51.080 --> 03:05:56.400
[Guest]: they have been bold enough to question the ulemas and there has been a substantive number

03:05:56.400 --> 03:06:03.840
[Guest]: of muslims who have done this uh since um the independence movement maulana azad was

03:06:03.840 --> 03:06:10.840
[Guest]: one of them he he was completely removed from this traditional ulema led or aligarh led

03:06:10.840 --> 03:06:16.840
[Guest]: community of muslims so there have been people like that and probably even today there's

03:06:16.840 --> 03:06:24.800
[Guest]: a kind of a balance there's equal number on both sides unfortunately the the moderate

03:06:24.800 --> 03:06:34.040
[Guest]: is usually uh silent because uh for various fears i mean he is viewed as a renegade muslim

03:06:34.040 --> 03:06:41.320
[Guest]: by the conservative ones you know like an apologist and he's viewed only as a muslim

03:06:41.320 --> 03:06:47.080
[Guest]: even by a non-muslim by a non-muslim they don't really see that okay so this person

03:06:47.080 --> 03:06:54.760
[Guest]: or this uh muslim is not a conservative fundamentalist dogmatic muslim they don't see they when when

03:06:54.760 --> 03:07:00.640
[Guest]: they are targeting you or when they want to vilify you you're only a muslim so this this

03:07:00.640 --> 03:07:08.400
[Guest]: class uh by and large remains invisible and silent because you don't want to draw attention

03:07:08.400 --> 03:07:13.400
[Guest]: to themselves which is why when we are talking of a muslim society you keep thinking about

03:07:13.400 --> 03:07:20.840
[Guest]: very rigid conservative people who are driven in largely by the ulema which is true a group

03:07:20.840 --> 03:07:25.680
[Guest]: a substantive part of the society is like that but there's also the other group which

03:07:25.680 --> 03:07:32.400
[Guest]: is not like that which is individualistic which has uh which has uh aspirations or dreams

03:07:32.400 --> 03:07:39.000
[Guest]: or desires like anybody else who do not really identify themselves with the community per

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:45.920
[Guest]: se but with their own socio-economic milieu where a middle-class muslim they see themselves

03:07:45.920 --> 03:07:51.440
[Guest]: as a middle class and like any other middle class they're they're struggling to go on

03:07:51.440 --> 03:07:56.200
[Guest]: an annual holiday they're struggling for a next promotion and job they're trying to get

03:07:56.200 --> 03:08:04.760
[Guest]: a scholarship so this class is also there and they they are convinced and more and more

03:08:04.760 --> 03:08:09.920
[Guest]: for in the last few uh years since probably the last decade they're getting it more and

03:08:09.920 --> 03:08:18.240
[Guest]: more convinced that the more they hide themselves better they will be able to go ahead in life

03:08:18.240 --> 03:08:22.520
[Guest]: i mean it's not just a question of survival it's also a question of leading a decent existence

03:08:22.520 --> 03:08:27.920
[Amit Varma]: no that's that's really tragic and resonant and you mentioned that it's become worse during

03:08:27.920 --> 03:08:31.400
[Amit Varma]: the last 10 years and and there are multiple reasons for that one of course is the rise

03:08:31.400 --> 03:08:35.880
[Amit Varma]: of the bjp which we'll talk about and uh you know how virulent everything has become but

03:08:35.880 --> 03:08:39.080
[Amit Varma]: as far as moderation is concerned like when you were telling me about the moderate muslim

03:08:39.080 --> 03:08:43.560
[Amit Varma]: yeah of course the radicals will think he's not muslim enough but then for the others

03:08:43.560 --> 03:08:49.520
[Amit Varma]: there is you know a moderate muslim can never do enough to convince him that he is not like

03:08:49.520 --> 03:08:54.400
[Amit Varma]: the radicals and that is in fact a tendency that i see in other domains also it's not

03:08:54.400 --> 03:08:59.320
[Amit Varma]: just about islam it's saying the domains of politics where for example the word centrist

03:08:59.320 --> 03:09:03.560
[Amit Varma]: has become a pejorative on twitter where people will call shekhar gupta a centrist as if you

03:09:03.560 --> 03:09:09.320
[Amit Varma]: know it is a pejorative and something really bad because what you have is uh you have these

03:09:09.320 --> 03:09:14.680
[Amit Varma]: echo ideological echo chambers on social media and they have their purity tests and it's

03:09:14.680 --> 03:09:19.560
[Amit Varma]: a race to extremism as you know within those echo chambers people will keep signaling their

03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:23.600
[Amit Varma]: virtue to get higher and higher and one way of doing that is by castigating those who

03:09:23.600 --> 03:09:28.000
[Amit Varma]: are not pure enough so if you don't belong to those echo chambers like i i suspect the

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:33.600
[Amit Varma]: vast silent majority uh then you might as well just stay silent um you know why invite

03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:38.840
[Amit Varma]: that mob upon yourself and i guess that's true in the context of anything that you know

03:09:38.840 --> 03:09:44.480
[Amit Varma]: i think social media also has exacerbated this drift towards the extremes now one of

03:09:44.480 --> 03:09:50.400
[Amit Varma]: the sort of parts of your book which i was struck by and also saddened by is when you

03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:57.600
[Amit Varma]: talk about this um you know person who does odd jobs and his name is g arun and uh which

03:09:57.600 --> 03:10:02.600
[Amit Varma]: is an odd name but one day you discover that his actual name is uh muhammad zia ul haq

03:10:02.600 --> 03:10:06.720
[Amit Varma]: which he tells you and you know two other people are sonu and bablu and one of them

03:10:06.720 --> 03:10:11.720
[Amit Varma]: one day tells you you know in confidence that hum bhi musliman hai and this is really sad

03:10:11.720 --> 03:10:17.120
[Amit Varma]: because it's almost as if they have to hide their identity from the others around them

03:10:17.120 --> 03:10:21.840
[Amit Varma]: so that there are no consequences just as a matter of precaution again going back to

03:10:21.840 --> 03:10:25.640
[Amit Varma]: annie's quote about you know home is not just where you are safe but where you are visible

03:10:25.640 --> 03:10:31.080
[Amit Varma]: and these are not people who feel comfortable enough to be visible and they go to the extent

03:10:31.080 --> 03:10:36.280
[Amit Varma]: of you know hiding their names and calling themselves sonu and bablu now you've referred

03:10:36.280 --> 03:10:44.600
[Amit Varma]: to sort of five historical reasons why there is this sort of distrust still has grown between

03:10:44.600 --> 03:10:48.960
[Amit Varma]: hindus and muslims and why you know they are in this state i'll quickly skip through them

03:10:48.960 --> 03:10:54.360
[Amit Varma]: and then ask you to elaborate yeah one there is partition where nearly eight million muslims

03:10:54.360 --> 03:10:59.400
[Amit Varma]: cross over to pakistan and a sizable proportion of these are the elites it's almost as if

03:10:59.400 --> 03:11:04.000
[Amit Varma]: all the elites who can afford to go just go and what you have left behind is the slightly

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:09.160
[Amit Varma]: lower classes and so that there it has a devastating impact then the bloodletting that happened

03:11:09.160 --> 03:11:14.760
[Amit Varma]: during partition leads to distrust so uh you know starting with siddharth patel who doesn't

03:11:14.760 --> 03:11:20.640
[Amit Varma]: want any muslims in the uh you know in the levers of government so muslims are filtered

03:11:20.640 --> 03:11:26.400
[Amit Varma]: out of the army and the bureaucracies and you quote najib jung at one point uh saying

03:11:26.400 --> 03:11:30.560
[Amit Varma]: even about the modern times that quote muslims on a selection panel may be hesitant to push

03:11:30.560 --> 03:11:36.960
[Amit Varma]: for a muslim candidate for fear of appearing parochial or communal stop quote and and then

03:11:36.960 --> 03:11:40.720
[Amit Varma]: this leads to the other factor that a lot of muslims feel hey we won't even get a fair

03:11:40.720 --> 03:11:46.680
[Amit Varma]: deal so you call it the reluctance to even try and they don't even sort of make the effort

03:11:46.680 --> 03:11:51.560
[Amit Varma]: you again quote wajahat habibullah saying quote there are two issues here actual exclusion

03:11:51.560 --> 03:11:57.720
[Amit Varma]: of the muslims and the feeling of exclusion from the national uh mainstream stop quote

03:11:57.720 --> 03:12:03.480
[Amit Varma]: and and of course they haven't then got um you know because of this day in secular education

03:12:03.480 --> 03:12:09.720
[Amit Varma]: they're not even educated enough they uh you know and and so they have uh less opportunities

03:12:09.720 --> 03:12:13.000
[Amit Varma]: of getting ahead of course some of them go to the gulf and all that but you speak about

03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:18.520
[Amit Varma]: the consequences of that the exposure to wahhabi islam uh you know the remittances which disturb

03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:24.720
[Amit Varma]: the social balance as you put it and finally you talk about how we are now in an equilibrium

03:12:24.720 --> 03:12:31.440
[Amit Varma]: where there is tremendous insecurity among muslims in india so uh and of course there's

03:12:31.440 --> 03:12:38.040
[Amit Varma]: also the sort of uh the political influence of uh what uh happened when the bjp kind of

03:12:38.040 --> 03:12:45.880
[Amit Varma]: um came to power and all of that which you know pushed uh the muslims to further um extremes

03:12:45.880 --> 03:12:51.360
[Amit Varma]: so tell me a little bit about all of this that you know the way these factors kind of

03:12:51.360 --> 03:12:58.240
[Amit Varma]: pile up it almost seems like you know it was always going to be this way i mean um which

03:12:58.240 --> 03:13:05.120
[Amit Varma]: is very kind of so what's what's your sense of where uh muslims are today like where is

03:13:05.120 --> 03:13:10.000
[Amit Varma]: this going is there a is there a direction in which this is going that makes you despair

03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:14.880
[Amit Varma]: i hear affluent people of all religions actually but also muslims saying that we want to leave

03:13:14.880 --> 03:13:20.960
[Amit Varma]: the country i know people who've already left because of the way uh things are going so

03:13:20.960 --> 03:13:26.640
[Amit Varma]: what is your sense of where things stand today like we are in 2021 for god's sake you would

03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:31.520
[Amit Varma]: have thought we've you know we've been globalizing through this period uh we've been exposed

03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:37.360
[Amit Varma]: to the whole world all of that are we going backwards what's going on i think let's look

03:13:37.360 --> 03:13:45.480
[Guest]: at it from a different way today uh i have quoted the figures in another chapter i think

03:13:45.480 --> 03:13:54.360
[Guest]: marginalization of indian muslims the rss outreach through educational institutions

03:13:54.360 --> 03:14:02.840
[Guest]: and professional uh coaching institutions is phenomenal they are uh churning out 20

03:14:02.840 --> 03:14:10.000
[Guest]: lakh nearly 20 lakh students uh from their various bharti schools all over the country

03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:16.840
[Guest]: every year now if this has been going on since the 50s these schools you can imagine the

03:14:16.840 --> 03:14:26.600
[Guest]: mass that they have uh created the then see the other side yeah in the same way they have

03:14:26.600 --> 03:14:36.200
[Guest]: uh our uh bureaucracy our civil services the kind of people who are uh joining the bureaucracy

03:14:36.200 --> 03:14:43.360
[Guest]: are mostly from small towns mostly from quasi villages or you know villages on the verge

03:14:43.360 --> 03:14:49.840
[Guest]: of being towns a lot of these uh people uh they have schooled at some point of their

03:14:49.840 --> 03:15:00.000
[Guest]: life in a rss run school or when they do this pre-is coaching or pre-army uh the ssc coaching

03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:07.200
[Guest]: when they try and do that they do it in a rss run school which institution a coaching

03:15:07.200 --> 03:15:17.120
[Guest]: center so this outreach is so huge and this kind of deliberately misleading version of

03:15:17.120 --> 03:15:23.040
[Guest]: your history which is being taught to them uh it becomes truth i mean why will you question

03:15:23.040 --> 03:15:27.880
[Guest]: it why will you think that you have been taught something which is completely false or which

03:15:27.880 --> 03:15:33.360
[Guest]: is not correct or which is exaggerated uh because if you've learned this uh it's part

03:15:33.360 --> 03:15:40.240
[Guest]: of your uh mental makeup now a lot of people think that history is nonsense history is

03:15:40.240 --> 03:15:45.280
[Guest]: it's of no use i mean you do sciences you do math you do computer sciences but the truth

03:15:45.280 --> 03:15:51.040
[Guest]: is at some point in your life you have studied a faulty history and that never leaves you

03:15:51.040 --> 03:15:57.400
[Guest]: that impression never leaves you take for instance partition we hear stories about atrocities

03:15:57.400 --> 03:16:04.680
[Guest]: that hindus and sikhs have suffered in partition we we have this uh this collection of stories

03:16:04.680 --> 03:16:08.880
[Guest]: from people people who have suffered they have and they have passed it on to the next

03:16:08.880 --> 03:16:15.080
[Guest]: generation to the children to the grandchildren they talk about it but the similar stories

03:16:15.080 --> 03:16:20.360
[Guest]: are also being collected in pakistan i mean it's not that there was no massacre of muslims

03:16:20.360 --> 03:16:24.760
[Guest]: i mean there was massacre of muslims also but when we recall partition or when we talk

03:16:24.760 --> 03:16:31.880
[Guest]: of partition and how how badly we have suffered we do not take into account that they have

03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:39.320
[Guest]: suffered equally so it's a collective suffering on both sides but in our narration it's one-sided

03:16:39.320 --> 03:16:44.160
[Guest]: then this narration goes further on then you talk about uh you bring in the ummah you bring

03:16:44.160 --> 03:16:51.120
[Guest]: in the islamic terrorism you bring in uh appeasement of muslim you bring in so many various factors

03:16:51.120 --> 03:16:59.960
[Guest]: to create an image of a community which has wronged us wronged the hindus they have their

03:16:59.960 --> 03:17:06.080
[Guest]: loyalty to india has always been suspect they have been fifth columnist they are the ones

03:17:06.080 --> 03:17:12.520
[Guest]: who get the best of the government policies i mean you you see even today people actually

03:17:12.520 --> 03:17:17.920
[Guest]: genuinely believe that muslims get the best of government policies the the policies favor

03:17:17.920 --> 03:17:22.960
[Guest]: the muslims which is not correct so when you have these kind of narratives coming from

03:17:22.960 --> 03:17:28.840
[Guest]: so many different sources why won't you believe that these are correct it's very difficult

03:17:28.840 --> 03:17:34.760
[Guest]: to sift through them and to tell people that look this is not true this is the other side

03:17:34.760 --> 03:17:41.440
[Guest]: you listen to the other side so when we talk of muslims becoming uh you know getting pushed

03:17:41.440 --> 03:17:46.000
[Guest]: out the muslims not trying enough in india muslims getting disillusioned or muslims being

03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:54.560
[Guest]: marginalized or muslims getting you know towards some kind of radical islam all all of this

03:17:54.560 --> 03:18:03.880
[Guest]: is a consequence of uh the realization this is academic uh information for a lot of people

03:18:03.880 --> 03:18:10.880
[Guest]: but for muslims this is something which they have grown up with uh in a small towns maybe

03:18:10.880 --> 03:18:16.640
[Guest]: it was much less when i was growing up i didn't see this in my face but uh in delhi when i

03:18:16.640 --> 03:18:22.200
[Guest]: came a big city which is supposed to be more modern which is supposed to be more liberal

03:18:22.200 --> 03:18:29.200
[Guest]: than agra which is like back or beyond i mean not really but in a manner of manner of speaking

03:18:29.200 --> 03:18:37.520
[Guest]: so when in a big town where people with a greater exposure have this sort of a perception

03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:43.240
[Guest]: of muslims where there is no curiosity of finding out about them uh it would automatically

03:18:43.240 --> 03:18:50.120
[Guest]: put you in a kind some kind of a reductive shell you you feel that maybe i'm not welcome

03:18:50.120 --> 03:18:56.000
[Guest]: or if i'm welcome then i'm being suspected all the time or you start doubting your own

03:18:56.000 --> 03:19:01.840
[Guest]: relationships with these people uh that uh whether they really are my friends or they're

03:19:01.840 --> 03:19:07.360
[Guest]: not or whether they're talking about me behind my back uh whether they gossip about me or

03:19:07.360 --> 03:19:14.240
[Guest]: whether they make fun of me the way i behave the way i dress or whatever or my my educational

03:19:14.240 --> 03:19:20.880
[Guest]: background so there are so many things which now then become part of this mindset which

03:19:20.880 --> 03:19:29.120
[Guest]: we are uh which we have kind of uh seen happening uh not just in the last 10 years but for many

03:19:29.120 --> 03:19:36.000
[Guest]: many years but now it is in our face because it has been growing so when we talk about

03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:45.360
[Guest]: what is the future i i feel that it is so difficult to actually penetrate this uh disinformation

03:19:45.360 --> 03:19:52.280
[Guest]: uh it's not even a campaign now it's like a wall of disinformation which has um uh which

03:19:52.280 --> 03:19:58.360
[Guest]: has been built all around us so it is so difficult to penetrate that but unless you penetrate

03:19:58.360 --> 03:20:07.040
[Guest]: this how do you tell them to see the right from wrong so the fate of muslims is not their

03:20:07.040 --> 03:20:14.720
[Guest]: fate alone i mean their fate is so intrinsically linked to the fate of how we go forward how

03:20:14.720 --> 03:20:22.360
[Guest]: as a nation we go forward are we going to be a modern progressive forward-looking country

03:20:22.360 --> 03:20:27.000
[Guest]: or are we going to be a country which is always thinking of historic wrongs which need to

03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:33.240
[Guest]: be righted now so which is why even when i was writing this book i was not thinking in

03:20:33.240 --> 03:20:40.120
[Guest]: terms of addressing only muslims my idea was that i need to make some kind of an effort

03:20:40.120 --> 03:20:44.680
[Guest]: that i'm reaching out to people and telling them that if you just have an open mind and

03:20:44.680 --> 03:20:50.760
[Guest]: give me a little time to read through a few things check for yourself check i mean their

03:20:50.760 --> 03:20:54.840
[Guest]: historical evidence is available everywhere so you just check for yourself whether what

03:20:54.840 --> 03:21:00.120
[Guest]: i'm saying what i'm writing is correct or not correct then real thing i mean if you

03:21:00.120 --> 03:21:06.960
[Guest]: just see around you don't even have to uh make an effort if you just try and look around

03:21:06.960 --> 03:21:13.280
[Guest]: and with an open mind you'll see what kind of people are uh all around you what kind

03:21:13.280 --> 03:21:17.200
[Guest]: of muslim people are around you you look at the muslims who are working in your offices

03:21:17.200 --> 03:21:22.760
[Guest]: do they do they fit in the version you have of them in your mind you see the muslim in

03:21:22.760 --> 03:21:29.160
[Guest]: your college is that the person you think a muslim is supposed to be then you'll realize

03:21:29.160 --> 03:21:38.480
[Guest]: that actually it is not difficult to break through your perceptions big break through

03:21:38.480 --> 03:21:45.440
[Guest]: your prejudice which you have inherited from your probably your parents or your leaders

03:21:45.440 --> 03:21:52.720
[Guest]: or yours or which you learned in some school you went to and that is the only way we can

03:21:52.720 --> 03:21:59.840
[Guest]: actually collectively move forward muslims cannot move forward on their own they have

03:21:59.840 --> 03:22:05.400
[Amit Varma]: to move forward with everybody else no man is an island i'd urge my listeners to read

03:22:05.400 --> 03:22:10.200
[Amit Varma]: your book because this is really only a small sampling of it everything that we've discussed

03:22:10.200 --> 03:22:14.880
[Amit Varma]: today and to really discuss your book properly would take 30 hours and not three and i don't

03:22:14.880 --> 03:22:19.160
[Amit Varma]: want to inflict that on you so i'll move away from the book for a moment and end with some

03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:27.240
[Amit Varma]: larger questions your thoughts on some larger issues and one is something that i don't have

03:22:27.240 --> 03:22:31.840
[Amit Varma]: an answer to which is how liberal are we as a society for example at one point i did an

03:22:31.840 --> 03:22:36.880
[Amit Varma]: episode with jp narayan the politician and i mentioned to him that india is a deeply

03:22:36.880 --> 03:22:42.160
[Amit Varma]: illiberal society and i hardly need to elaborate on that the way women are treated the way

03:22:42.160 --> 03:22:46.040
[Amit Varma]: minorities are treated the caste system blah blah blah and he said that if you look at

03:22:46.040 --> 03:22:51.000
[Amit Varma]: it another way we are a deeply liberal society in terms of our lived life the way that there

03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:55.800
[Amit Varma]: is a lift tolerance there we assimilate so much from so many cultures and all of that

03:22:55.800 --> 03:23:00.420
[Amit Varma]: and i get it that there is a stand of that also now when i look back on indian history

03:23:00.420 --> 03:23:05.720
[Amit Varma]: in the last sort of hundred years what what kind of strikes me is that what is happening

03:23:05.720 --> 03:23:12.280
[Amit Varma]: today while it has come to our politics this sort of othering of muslims and this very

03:23:12.280 --> 03:23:17.360
[Amit Varma]: toxic polarizing politics while it's come to our politics today while it's gained dominance

03:23:17.360 --> 03:23:22.100
[Amit Varma]: in our politics today rather it's always been in our culture something that i got a slightly

03:23:22.100 --> 03:23:25.780
[Amit Varma]: deeper realization of when i did an episode with akshay mukul who's written a brilliant

03:23:25.780 --> 03:23:30.680
[Amit Varma]: book on the gita press and one sees that you know when you look at the bhagavad you know

03:23:30.680 --> 03:23:34.440
[Amit Varma]: their version of the bhagavad gita selling 70 million copies and the kind of things that

03:23:34.440 --> 03:23:38.400
[Amit Varma]: they sell not just the bhagavad gita which anyway everyone should read it's a great book

03:23:38.400 --> 03:23:43.440
[Amit Varma]: regardless or whatever but the other kind of stuff that they sell including uh you know

03:23:43.440 --> 03:23:49.440
[Amit Varma]: much of like you know what i learned from reading his book was how old these campaigns

03:23:49.440 --> 03:23:53.360
[Amit Varma]: like love jihad and the campaign against cow slaughter and all of those actually are it's

03:23:53.360 --> 03:23:57.880
[Amit Varma]: not something new it's they've gained dominance in politics recently but they've been around

03:23:57.880 --> 03:24:02.840
[Amit Varma]: in culture for a long time and my sort of sense and the sense that kind of gives me

03:24:02.840 --> 03:24:08.140
[Amit Varma]: some hope is that we all contain multitudes so therefore somebody who might on the one

03:24:08.140 --> 03:24:13.880
[Amit Varma]: hand be drawn by abstract notions of nationalism or india is for the hindus or whatever might

03:24:13.880 --> 03:24:20.720
[Amit Varma]: also have other aspects to her personality which are much more tolerant and assimilative

03:24:20.720 --> 03:24:27.440
[Amit Varma]: and therefore uh you know one hopeful hypothesis is that what currently uh the people in power

03:24:27.440 --> 03:24:32.180
[Amit Varma]: have managed to appeal to and what has currently become the dominant narrative strand is this

03:24:32.180 --> 03:24:37.400
[Amit Varma]: particular strand but there are other strands which are possible because there are you know

03:24:37.400 --> 03:24:42.480
[Amit Varma]: we do contain multitudes we are illiberal but at the same time we are liberal what is

03:24:42.480 --> 03:24:47.680
[Amit Varma]: your take on that you know is there uh you know like someone once said whatever you say

03:24:47.680 --> 03:24:53.180
[Amit Varma]: of india the opposite is also true so is that something that you'd agree with is that something

03:24:53.180 --> 03:24:56.960
[Amit Varma]: that you know i i know that we can look all around us and there is a lot to give us the

03:24:56.960 --> 03:25:01.580
[Amit Varma]: spare are there also things that give you hope and feel that at a cultural level because

03:25:01.580 --> 03:25:06.720
[Amit Varma]: it has to change at a cultural level first before anything else changes at a cultural

03:25:06.720 --> 03:25:12.280
[Amit Varma]: level is there hope that say the better angels of our nature so to say can express themselves

03:25:12.280 --> 03:25:19.320
[Guest]: what is your sense of this uh i i completely agree we are actually there's a huge dichotomy

03:25:19.320 --> 03:25:25.320
[Guest]: between in our country we have always been very tolerant of outsiders at one level but

03:25:25.320 --> 03:25:31.980
[Guest]: we have also been xenophobic i mean we have been very liberal in our approach to a lot

03:25:31.980 --> 03:25:40.640
[Guest]: of issues acceptance of others being one of them tolerance of everybody whether it's you

03:25:40.640 --> 03:25:46.400
[Guest]: know even gay i mean now there has been a bit of homophobia around i mean there has

03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:50.600
[Guest]: been a strand of homophobia but there has been acceptance and it's part been part of

03:25:50.600 --> 03:25:57.720
[Guest]: our culture we have been very very reverential about women in certain matters and i'm not

03:25:57.720 --> 03:26:05.040
[Guest]: talking about worship but we have been accepting of women leadership also and not just in politics

03:26:05.040 --> 03:26:10.840
[Guest]: but in other parts of our lives also whether it's businesses business houses or in within

03:26:10.840 --> 03:26:20.160
[Guest]: the family and then we have cases of complete horrific violence against women so we kind

03:26:20.160 --> 03:26:26.520
[Guest]: of inhabit both worlds but uh coming to your question specific question about what gives

03:26:26.520 --> 03:26:36.440
[Guest]: you hope i think the recent example of this caa nrc protest which broke out or which started

03:26:36.440 --> 03:26:43.440
[Guest]: in uh shaheen bagh and it kind of sprouted in all parts of india and it was essentially

03:26:43.440 --> 03:26:50.680
[Guest]: driven by a muslim's insecurity about their place in india whether they'll be declared

03:26:50.680 --> 03:26:59.520
[Guest]: as non-indians and shoved into some camp but the kind of support that it garnered from

03:26:59.520 --> 03:27:05.920
[Guest]: all sorts of people even people who were no not known to be activists they came out on

03:27:05.920 --> 03:27:13.840
[Guest]: the streets to uh support this assault on what they called constitution but assault

03:27:13.840 --> 03:27:19.360
[Guest]: on constitution again is an abstract vague concept essentially on the ground what was

03:27:19.360 --> 03:27:26.480
[Guest]: happening was assault on a community based on their religion and you see people who had

03:27:26.480 --> 03:27:33.680
[Guest]: no familiarity with the urdu poetry were singing faiz emad faiz and there were people who had

03:27:33.680 --> 03:27:42.080
[Guest]: memorized it and actually it's not an easy to learn and it's not easy to understand also

03:27:42.080 --> 03:27:49.760
[Guest]: besides it has a very strong islamic imagery i mean though it's not a religious poem but

03:27:49.760 --> 03:27:55.920
[Guest]: it has a strong islamic imagery which goes back to the time of the prophet so uh despite

03:27:55.920 --> 03:28:05.320
[Guest]: that people were saying that so i think that all this shows that there is a sustained pushback

03:28:05.320 --> 03:28:10.200
[Guest]: in whatever way you know if you're faced with police and police is completely compromised

03:28:10.200 --> 03:28:15.400
[Guest]: and they're hitting out at you it's very difficult and it's not fair also to expect that people

03:28:15.400 --> 03:28:22.620
[Guest]: will will continuously be standing against uh this sort of violence but this pushback

03:28:22.620 --> 03:28:31.000
[Guest]: this uh even emotional agitation which uh happened among a lot of people and non-muslims

03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:39.200
[Guest]: it's very it's i encouraging is a very condescending word it is something which tells you that

03:28:39.200 --> 03:28:48.200
[Guest]: uh this rss outreach it's not been a completely successful project that despite uh they're

03:28:48.200 --> 03:28:57.560
[Guest]: trying to kind of build a narrative in their own way uh it has not percolated down to the

03:28:57.560 --> 03:29:03.760
[Guest]: last citizen of the country there are people who are still thinking and resisting because

03:29:03.760 --> 03:29:12.800
[Guest]: they feel that this is not what uh india is or this is not what india stands for i think

03:29:12.800 --> 03:29:19.920
[Guest]: this is this has been a huge moment i i am also not a activist by temperament i am a

03:29:19.920 --> 03:29:28.560
[Guest]: very uh quite a sort of a person i like to be on my own i like being on my own quietly

03:29:28.560 --> 03:29:34.200
[Guest]: sitting in one corner and just thinking about things and daydreaming or i'm not a very social

03:29:34.200 --> 03:29:39.300
[Guest]: person but when all this was happening and i was reading up stuff and i was watching

03:29:39.300 --> 03:29:45.680
[Guest]: videos it was something which was filling me up with this huge desire to go out there

03:29:45.680 --> 03:29:50.760
[Guest]: and maybe i should also stand with them and do something maybe uh i'm wasting my life

03:29:50.760 --> 03:29:57.520
[Guest]: just sitting in my study and doing nothing uh so that sort of momentum which it created

03:29:57.520 --> 03:30:04.040
[Guest]: i think in it has been unparalleled in recent times and this is what is happening now with

03:30:04.040 --> 03:30:10.840
[Guest]: the farmers protest also so probably things will not change in a hurry but as long as

03:30:10.840 --> 03:30:16.360
[Guest]: this resistance is there as long as there are people who believe that they need to stand

03:30:16.360 --> 03:30:23.280
[Guest]: up and be counted whatever the consequences we shouldn't despair no very wise words and

03:30:23.280 --> 03:30:27.280
[Amit Varma]: and as an aside you mentioned daydreaming now and earlier and it struck me when you

03:30:27.280 --> 03:30:31.160
[Amit Varma]: mentioned it earlier that i'm also a huge daydreamer to the point that you know when

03:30:31.160 --> 03:30:35.560
[Amit Varma]: i first read james serber's famous short story the secret life of walter mitty i thought

03:30:35.560 --> 03:30:39.520
[Amit Varma]: that what is a big deal about this aren't we all like this you know am i the only unusual

03:30:39.520 --> 03:30:45.120
[Amit Varma]: person who's exactly like this and again i've done episodes on the caa and also radically

03:30:45.120 --> 03:30:49.000
[Amit Varma]: networked societies i link those from the show notes which that was a great example

03:30:49.000 --> 03:30:52.880
[Amit Varma]: of society and the state that also gave me a lot of hope so many young people not just

03:30:52.880 --> 03:30:58.320
[Amit Varma]: singing fairs but uh you know uh waving the preamble of the constitution on the streets

03:30:58.320 --> 03:31:02.040
[Amit Varma]: like who would have thunk of something like that a generation back though i wish they

03:31:02.040 --> 03:31:07.320
[Amit Varma]: had waved the ambedkar version and not the indira gandhi uh version with the word socialism

03:31:07.320 --> 03:31:13.000
[Amit Varma]: in it but regardless some preamble is better than no preamble my other question is about

03:31:13.000 --> 03:31:18.680
[Amit Varma]: politics now at at one point um in your book and i'll go back to your book just to uh sort

03:31:18.680 --> 03:31:23.000
[Amit Varma]: of get into the subject where uh you write about indira gandhi's role in this and you

03:31:23.000 --> 03:31:27.280
[Amit Varma]: say quote the deterioration was due to a large degree to indira gandhi's changed style of

03:31:27.280 --> 03:31:33.040
[Amit Varma]: politics the minorities had begun to move away from the congress i uh indira gandhi

03:31:33.040 --> 03:31:38.960
[Amit Varma]: made a bid for the hindu vote to the bjp's discomfort uh stop quote and i i did an episode

03:31:38.960 --> 03:31:45.920
[Amit Varma]: with vinay sitapati recently on uh you know the bjp before uh modi and shah so to say

03:31:45.920 --> 03:31:49.240
[Amit Varma]: and one of the things that emerges there is that the congress turned to the hindu vote

03:31:49.240 --> 03:31:53.880
[Amit Varma]: in a big way in the early 80s and the bjp had then uh you know when they were formed

03:31:53.880 --> 03:31:58.160
[Amit Varma]: vajpayee was saying all these flowery things about gandhi and socialism and all that but

03:31:58.160 --> 03:32:02.080
[Amit Varma]: they had to respond because the hindu vote was going away and therefore they responded

03:32:02.080 --> 03:32:06.400
[Amit Varma]: by getting more and more radical and uh you know and it became a race to the bottom and

03:32:06.400 --> 03:32:11.680
[Amit Varma]: of course the bjp won because uh you know the bottom was not a new place for them uh

03:32:11.680 --> 03:32:17.960
[Amit Varma]: so uh and and when i look at current times one of the things that disheartens me is that

03:32:17.960 --> 03:32:23.440
[Amit Varma]: uh that soft hindutva of the congress remains in a lot of what they do they did make kamal

03:32:23.440 --> 03:32:29.200
[Amit Varma]: jainath cm of uh madhya pradesh despite all their posturing on uh twitter they'll do that

03:32:29.200 --> 03:32:33.520
[Amit Varma]: soft hindutva thing they'll chase that vote you know when the temple judgment came they

03:32:33.520 --> 03:32:38.280
[Amit Varma]: actually said that uh you know uh it was rajiv gandhi who first opened the gates and all

03:32:38.280 --> 03:32:43.000
[Amit Varma]: of that you see the amadmi party uh chasing that also with the you know the chanting of

03:32:43.000 --> 03:32:47.600
[Amit Varma]: the hanuman chalisa after the last election and all of that and i think one realization

03:32:47.600 --> 03:32:52.920
[Amit Varma]: or at least one perception because it may not be true so i won't call it realization

03:32:52.920 --> 03:32:58.540
[Amit Varma]: but one perception which all these parties seem to have come to is that you cannot mess

03:32:58.540 --> 03:33:05.880
[Amit Varma]: with the hindu vote so uh does that put a limit on the politics that can happen on behalf

03:33:05.880 --> 03:33:12.000
[Amit Varma]: of the marginalized people uh in this country the fact that you know that there is a realization

03:33:12.000 --> 03:33:16.880
[Amit Varma]: among the parties or there is an perception among the parties because i don't believe

03:33:16.880 --> 03:33:20.480
[Amit Varma]: it's entirely true but there is a perception among the parties that you cannot piss off

03:33:20.480 --> 03:33:24.840
[Amit Varma]: the hindu vote which is why even when caa was happening right there in delhi you did

03:33:24.840 --> 03:33:29.640
[Amit Varma]: not see kejriwal besides making a few token noises really going out there and doing something

03:33:29.640 --> 03:33:34.080
[Amit Varma]: about it so now obviously it is true as i keep saying on the show that politics is downstream

03:33:34.080 --> 03:33:38.640
[Amit Varma]: of culture the culture has to change first then the politics will respond but uh you

03:33:38.640 --> 03:33:43.320
[Amit Varma]: know the culture is complicated it's got multitudes all of that but in a political sense is there

03:33:43.320 --> 03:33:48.880
[Amit Varma]: something that gives you hope someone who will actually fight against this because you

03:33:48.880 --> 03:33:53.600
[Amit Varma]: know despite the random twitter posturing the rahul gandhi may do on the ground the

03:33:53.600 --> 03:33:57.920
[Amit Varma]: congress doesn't give a shit they're playing the soft end of the game so what is your perception

03:33:57.920 --> 03:34:04.280
[Amit Varma]: of our politics the way it is and what it means for muslims see i think uh under the

03:34:04.280 --> 03:34:09.480
[Guest]: circumstances uh the soft hindutva would be acceptable to a large number of people because

03:34:09.480 --> 03:34:15.860
[Guest]: at least uh this doesn't result in everyday violence i mean congress has been done doing

03:34:15.860 --> 03:34:23.880
[Guest]: soft hindutva for decades but it didn't result in uh lynching of people and at least there

03:34:23.880 --> 03:34:30.000
[Guest]: was some token lip service uh after every riot and the government or the law enforcement

03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:35.240
[Guest]: agencies didn't really go after the victims in the way they do now i mean they actually

03:34:35.240 --> 03:34:39.380
[Guest]: frame the victims if a person is getting lynched his the charge sheet is filed against his

03:34:39.380 --> 03:34:47.720
[Guest]: family also so at least this sort of everyday terrorism of civilians was not uh there so

03:34:47.720 --> 03:34:55.440
[Guest]: probably we'll return to this happy coexistence of uh increasing hinduization of indian society

03:34:55.440 --> 03:35:00.600
[Guest]: which i think it very difficult to resist for the simple reason the majority is hindu

03:35:00.600 --> 03:35:06.400
[Guest]: and uh there is increased religiosity of our public spaces it's not just hindu religiosity

03:35:06.400 --> 03:35:12.160
[Guest]: but even muslims are becoming overtly i mean in their wherever their numerical strengths

03:35:12.160 --> 03:35:19.760
[Guest]: they are becoming overtly demonstrative about their identity or any other religion so that

03:35:19.760 --> 03:35:24.480
[Guest]: is something which is uh happening in our society probably some kind of churning is

03:35:24.480 --> 03:35:29.440
[Guest]: required and at some level we'll some point in time we'll realize that it is all stupidity

03:35:29.440 --> 03:35:38.120
[Guest]: and we'll go back to being normal human beings but if this fear of if this fear of the street

03:35:38.120 --> 03:35:44.880
[Guest]: goes away then probably more muslims can come out and claim part of this street right now

03:35:44.880 --> 03:35:51.160
[Guest]: one of the reasons why they are comfortable in moving to a ghetto though they don't get

03:35:51.160 --> 03:35:55.480
[Guest]: accommodation in a lot of places but even when the accommodation option is available

03:35:55.480 --> 03:36:00.280
[Guest]: a lot of them prefer to go to a ghetto is because they think it's safe for them and

03:36:00.280 --> 03:36:06.320
[Guest]: their children so once your streets are safer your public transportation is safer you'll

03:36:06.320 --> 03:36:11.880
[Guest]: see more people accessing it more people trying making an effort here more people asserting

03:36:11.880 --> 03:36:19.120
[Guest]: their rights here so that can probably over a period of time have a cascading effect on

03:36:19.120 --> 03:36:25.920
[Guest]: our society and our you know the culture as we know it and going back to what kefi has

03:36:25.920 --> 03:36:30.760
[Guest]: we had said that if every hindu has one or two muslim friends then if there are more

03:36:30.760 --> 03:36:36.080
[Guest]: muslims in public spaces and probably more hindus can find muslim friends and they'll

03:36:36.080 --> 03:36:45.720
[Guest]: learn to distinguish between what they perceived and what they find your very wise words i've

03:36:45.720 --> 03:36:49.880
[Amit Varma]: taken up a lot of your time so i'll end with a final question which has nothing to do either

03:36:49.880 --> 03:36:54.200
[Amit Varma]: with the book or the subject at hand but instead about you i'm always sort of awed when an

03:36:54.200 --> 03:36:59.440
[Amit Varma]: author writes a book like this because i think about just that process how it must have changed

03:36:59.440 --> 03:37:05.320
[Amit Varma]: that person because i think writing a serious book is always also a process of self-discovery

03:37:05.320 --> 03:37:10.160
[Amit Varma]: about learning things about yourself and all of that how did this book change you like

03:37:10.160 --> 03:37:14.880
[Amit Varma]: what are the big things you know now that you did not know before the book perhaps or

03:37:14.880 --> 03:37:18.200
[Amit Varma]: you know i mean what gave you the impetus to do a book like this and having done a book

03:37:18.200 --> 03:37:23.200
[Amit Varma]: like this you know what was the process like was it difficult was it hard at one point

03:37:23.200 --> 03:37:27.880
[Amit Varma]: you wrote about you know how your dad wasn't so comfortable about the personal bits of

03:37:27.880 --> 03:37:32.960
[Amit Varma]: you know your childhood and all of that but i think yesterday on twitter you wrote that

03:37:32.960 --> 03:37:37.800
[Amit Varma]: he said to you that he's very proud of the way that you've written about the whole subject

03:37:37.800 --> 03:37:42.600
[Amit Varma]: and indeed he should be because what a wonderful book so tell me a little bit about this process

03:37:42.600 --> 03:37:48.760
[Guest]: and what it's meant to you actually i think i was veering towards writing this book since

03:37:48.760 --> 03:37:55.600
[Guest]: i started this magazine called force in 2003 though it was a magazine on national security

03:37:55.600 --> 03:38:02.480
[Guest]: and defense and our focus was on the indian military and external defense at that time

03:38:02.480 --> 03:38:10.480
[Guest]: but that was also the time when this global war on terrorism was underway and we used

03:38:10.480 --> 03:38:15.640
[Guest]: to meet i mean when i used to go and meet people especially from the armed forces i

03:38:15.640 --> 03:38:23.440
[Guest]: used to hear constantly that about terrorism i used to travel a lot to kashmir my early

03:38:23.440 --> 03:38:32.440
[Guest]: reporting uh was always from kashmir and and i as i became more and more familiar with

03:38:32.440 --> 03:38:39.040
[Guest]: the insurgency and the antecedents of insurgency the problems that the people are facing there

03:38:39.040 --> 03:38:48.440
[Guest]: again the vilification which we see now in the mainstream the mainland india i started

03:38:48.440 --> 03:38:53.800
[Guest]: with kashmir i mean that is the people have been living with that for years so i i used

03:38:53.800 --> 03:38:59.320
[Guest]: to write when i used to come back and write my article in the magazine i used to bring

03:38:59.320 --> 03:39:08.040
[Guest]: in these elements about how rumors are spread how perceptions are deliberately built to

03:39:08.040 --> 03:39:16.120
[Guest]: actually dehumanize some people i mean uh my early earliest experience in kashmir was

03:39:16.120 --> 03:39:22.160
[Guest]: so uh traumatizing for me i mean though i was not at the receiving end but i was being

03:39:22.160 --> 03:39:29.720
[Guest]: driven to uh to a separatist leader's house by a local boy who wanted to become a journalist

03:39:29.720 --> 03:39:34.480
[Guest]: i had gone to the press colony to meet some people and one of the journalists said that

03:39:34.480 --> 03:39:39.840
[Guest]: my younger brother also wants to be a journalist and he wants to go to delhi and study journalism

03:39:39.840 --> 03:39:47.840
[Guest]: very young nice enthusiastic boy and he offered to drive me uh to this leader's house and

03:39:47.840 --> 03:39:59.200
[Guest]: while we were going there the car was stopped by a crpf guy who used his bait into we very

03:39:59.200 --> 03:40:07.680
[Guest]: violently uh bound the the engine the drum and he stopped the car and he spoke to this

03:40:07.680 --> 03:40:14.560
[Guest]: boy very harshly and this boy immediately minutes before was you know very enthusiastically

03:40:14.560 --> 03:40:19.080
[Guest]: telling me his plans and how he was going to finish school now and if i could help him

03:40:19.080 --> 03:40:27.520
[Guest]: and uh he was stopped violently and this guy he was scouring in fear i mean he was shaken

03:40:27.520 --> 03:40:33.960
[Guest]: up so badly he got out of the car and this constable was so insulting i also got out

03:40:33.960 --> 03:40:40.320
[Guest]: and i said why are you talking to him like this and he said madam up to pray here

03:40:40.320 --> 03:40:45.600
[Guest]: so i felt this everyday humiliation and this boy from that point till the rest of my journey

03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:49.760
[Guest]: he kept quiet he didn't say anything because obviously he felt so humiliated in front of

03:40:49.760 --> 03:40:54.200
[Guest]: somebody he was bragging about he was talking about how great he is and how well he's doing

03:40:54.200 --> 03:41:01.400
[Guest]: in school and so that was my first experience and then subsequently i used to see we are

03:41:01.400 --> 03:41:05.960
[Guest]: traveling someplace and i'm one fancy journalist from delhi so nobody would trouble me but

03:41:05.960 --> 03:41:10.800
[Guest]: uh the driver of the car would be harassed the taxi would be harassed at every checkpoint

03:41:10.800 --> 03:41:18.000
[Guest]: and every hundred meters there would be a checkpoint so that i i became more um engaged

03:41:18.000 --> 03:41:25.840
[Guest]: with their everyday struggle instead of the big picture of pakistan instigating violence

03:41:25.840 --> 03:41:32.680
[Guest]: or terrorism into india and while i was engaging with them more and more i came across a islamic

03:41:32.680 --> 03:41:38.200
[Guest]: sect la hadith my first encounter with the islamic sect was in kashmir because in delhi

03:41:38.200 --> 03:41:45.760
[Guest]: i have not been so exposed to the muslims or various strands of islam because i was

03:41:45.760 --> 03:41:50.640
[Guest]: not exposed to them when i was growing up in my work my career did not expose me to

03:41:50.640 --> 03:41:59.800
[Guest]: this kind of uh religious conservatism but it was in kashmir so that is how i got drawn

03:41:59.800 --> 03:42:07.400
[Guest]: into uh writing you know kind of a clarification about the religion and trying to address both

03:42:07.400 --> 03:42:13.120
[Guest]: the muslims as well as the non-muslims that uh you know this is nonsense what i'm talking

03:42:13.120 --> 03:42:17.400
[Guest]: about so jihad was one of the early subjects that i started writing about that you know

03:42:17.400 --> 03:42:27.240
[Guest]: it's nonsense so as in uh gradually i became more and more involved in uh writing on terrorism

03:42:27.240 --> 03:42:33.080
[Guest]: i realized that even my understanding was so limited so i had to do a lot of reading

03:42:33.080 --> 03:42:40.960
[Guest]: to actually make sense of my arguments so with this background when i started to write

03:42:40.960 --> 03:42:46.640
[Guest]: the book or when i started to conceptualize i my first audience i thought was going to

03:42:46.640 --> 03:42:52.000
[Guest]: be the muslims and i was going to tell them that you're stupid people why are you uh doing

03:42:52.000 --> 03:42:56.440
[Guest]: these things to yourself i mean this is not what the religion tells you but in the course

03:42:56.440 --> 03:43:04.600
[Guest]: of researching for it i uh came across uh these examples which i have just narrated

03:43:04.600 --> 03:43:11.120
[Guest]: from kashmir and i realized that this sort of marginalization everyday marginalization

03:43:11.120 --> 03:43:21.080
[Guest]: in your your cities in your workplaces uh is actually a reality which i have been blind

03:43:21.080 --> 03:43:27.880
[Guest]: to because maybe my privileged background and the fact that in media in any case there

03:43:27.880 --> 03:43:32.880
[Guest]: is a preponderance of muslims so that kind of insulates you from the larger society because

03:43:32.880 --> 03:43:40.560
[Guest]: you only see uh what you see around you i mean you don't really see beyond what is evident

03:43:40.560 --> 03:43:45.400
[Guest]: to you it's only when you sit down and sometimes reflect and then you realize that probably

03:43:45.400 --> 03:43:50.760
[Guest]: there is another side to the story or there is a truth behind uh what is visible to you

03:43:50.760 --> 03:43:59.160
[Guest]: at that point so that is how the process started and my biggest learning and actually it has

03:43:59.160 --> 03:44:06.200
[Guest]: been a massive learning is about my own religion because i did not have this great background

03:44:06.200 --> 03:44:13.120
[Guest]: in religious history or practices because it was never inculcated in me when i was growing

03:44:13.120 --> 03:44:23.760
[Guest]: up uh this has been a revelation i had never regarded islam as a reasonable and you know

03:44:23.760 --> 03:44:32.840
[Guest]: a balanced sort of faith i was not aware that even today it's like this peaceful conversion

03:44:32.840 --> 03:44:37.760
[Guest]: to islam as a worldwide phenomena i mean when i was looking at these statistics i realized

03:44:37.760 --> 03:44:43.480
[Guest]: there must be something about it which people still find gives them hope so they want to

03:44:43.480 --> 03:44:52.560
[Guest]: embrace it so this has been a learning for me and i feel if i can learn this if i can

03:44:52.560 --> 03:44:57.600
[Guest]: find this out without making so much of an effort i mean it just takes a little bit of

03:44:57.600 --> 03:45:03.320
[Guest]: reading and a little bit of observation why can't others do that you know i think you're

03:45:03.320 --> 03:45:06.560
[Amit Varma]: understating it when you say a little bit of reading and a little bit of observation

03:45:06.560 --> 03:45:10.380
[Amit Varma]: because you've clearly done a lot of both and and you know what i'm also impressed by
