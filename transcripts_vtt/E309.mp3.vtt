00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[Amit Varma]: The days are long, but the years are short. When a year ends, as 2022 is ending soon,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.320
[Amit Varma]: it's a good time to sit back and take stock. But for this year-ending episode, I didn't

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.440
[Amit Varma]: want big serious subjects, ponderous self-reflection, laments about the state of the world. Instead,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.360
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to sit and take stock of all the things that should give us hope. I wanted

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.200
[Amit Varma]: life lessons that could inspire us to move forward. I often speak of hope and despair

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.520
[Amit Varma]: on this show. Well, in this episode, I wanted you and me to feel hopeful at the end of it.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.840
[Amit Varma]: And boy, am I happy with the two friends I called on and the conversation we had.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.440
[Amit Varma]: This was one of my most enjoyable conversations. And when I heard it back,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.040
[Amit Varma]: I was blown away by the amount of wisdom that these two guests brought to the table,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.960
[Amit Varma]: which I hadn't even noticed while recording because we were so busy having a blast.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.120
[Amit Varma]: Now, I know this was a long episode, but my last episode to go over 7 hours,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.480
[Amit Varma]: episode 303 with Nikhil Taneja, the loneliness of the Indian man,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.640
[Amit Varma]: touched so many people so deeply that I'm still getting emails about it. I mean,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.480
[Amit Varma]: I only go long when the conversation is so great that we lose track of time.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.120
[Amit Varma]: So do listen to this episode as well, in parts if you have to. When you reach the end,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.360
[Amit Varma]: I promise you'll ask, hey, why did it end so soon? But hey, 2022 is also ending so soon.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.360
[Amit Varma]: But let's enjoy the years ahead of us and the many conversations ahead of us.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.040
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.280
[Unknown]: politics and behavioral science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.440
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My guests today for the special year-end episode are my

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.080
[Amit Varma]: good friends Vikram Sathe and Roshan Abbas. Now, if I try to give Roshan the introduction he

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.080
[Amit Varma]: deserves, that only will take 7 hours. He's a radio star, a TV star, an events mogul, a filmmaker,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.800
[Amit Varma]: an entrepreneur and today, a mentor and an inspiration to young creators everywhere

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.280
[Amit Varma]: and older ones like me. But most of all, at least for me, he's a good human being

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.600
[Amit Varma]: who makes me also want to be a better person. He's been on the show before, and I urge you

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.000
[Amit Varma]: to check out that earlier episode as well, in which he talks about his life, his learnings

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.160
[Amit Varma]: and the creator economy. In this episode, we spoke more about his life and learnings,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.560
[Amit Varma]: and he spoke about what he learnt and unlearned while playing the role of Lalit Verma in the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.080
[Amit Varma]: musical version of Monsoon Wedding, which is going to Broadway soon. How Meera Nair taught him to have

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.400
[Amit Varma]: the heart of a poet and the skin of an elephant. And how, as Roshan keeps telling me, one must

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.200
[Amit Varma]: either be interested or be interesting. And to me, Roshan is both of those, which is why he makes for

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.800
[Amit Varma]: such a delightful guest. My other guest today is my old buddy Vikram Sathe, also known variously

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.240
[Amit Varma]: as Baljeet and Parpeetaram, who was my contemporary in Ferguson College, Pune in the early 1990s,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.720
[Amit Varma]: and later my colleague at MTV in the mid to late 90s. He worked in marketing then,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.920
[Amit Varma]: which was kind of at odds with his past as a budding musician, singer and cricketer. Now,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.440
[Amit Varma]: one of his side skills then was comedy, and one subset of his comedy skills was mimicry. He soon

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.680
[Amit Varma]: got known for that, entertained people with his stand-up act on cricket, and what was timepass

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.200
[Amit Varma]: at parties became a profession. A decade before India's stand-up explosion, Vikram was doing sold

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.560
[Amit Varma]: out shows and corporate events and did literally thousands of performances. He also got into cricket

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.560
[Amit Varma]: broadcasting and became good friends with top cricketers, just as he already was with top

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.000
[Amit Varma]: artists. He's one person I know who was close to both the Tendulkars, Vijay Tendulkar and Sachin

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Tendulkar, and one of his great skills was in imbibing life lessons from everyone he came

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.320
[Amit Varma]: across. He did this from both Tendulkars, he wrote a best-selling book about his journey,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.800
[Amit Varma]: and then made a wildly successful YouTube show, What the Duck with Vikram Sathe,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.560
[Amit Varma]: in which he spoke to top cricketers and revealed the way they think for all of us.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.680
[Amit Varma]: Besides his comedy and his YouTubing, he also became a top motivational speaker,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.000
[Amit Varma]: and now spends time investing his hard-earned money, paying it back as it were.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.240
[Amit Varma]: I've always loved three qualities of Vikram which I try to work on for myself. One,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.600
[Amit Varma]: his constant curiosity about the world. Two, his humility, despite his many achievements,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.400
[Amit Varma]: which always keeps him open to learning into new experiences. And three, his good humour,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.640
[Amit Varma]: the positive energy that keeps him moving forward. And hey, coming to think of it,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.400
[Amit Varma]: Roshan shares these qualities as well. We explored Vikram's journey in this episode,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.000
[Amit Varma]: in which he shared his learnings from Bollywood, from the corporate world, from sport,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.800
[Amit Varma]: and as Roshan did as well, from life. This is one of the most enjoyable conversations I've

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.840
[Amit Varma]: ever had on the show, not least because of the feast of singing towards the end.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:55.680
[Amit Varma]: Just wonderful. But before we begin, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:21.680
[Amit Varma]: So if you're interested, head on over to register at indiauncut.com slash clear writing.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.280
[Amit Varma]: That's indiauncut.com slash clear writing. Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.880
[Amit Varma]: just a willingness to work hard and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.680
[Amit Varma]: I can help you.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.000
[Amit Varma]: Roshan and Vikram, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.160
[Amit Varma]: Fabulous to be here with you again.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.200
[Guest 2]: Thank you Amit for having me. 30 years I've known you, finally you've given me some respect.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.080
[Amit Varma]: Okay, that's a good way to start. So let me start by sort of bringing up an interesting

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.960
[Amit Varma]: observation. Yesterday I saw this tweet from Tim Urban basically to the effect of how when you are

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.800
[Amit Varma]: young, you have no money, but lots of time. And as you get older, when you get to the age that we are,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.360
[Amit Varma]: you have the money problem is hopefully solved, you have more money, but you have less time,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.440
[Amit Varma]: time is a scarce resource. And you know, Paul Graham replied to this, you know,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.280
[Amit Varma]: from an investment point of view saying that when you're building something for the young,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.960
[Amit Varma]: remember that they have no money, but they have time and vice versa for older people.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.040
[Amit Varma]: And I was kind of just wondering, you know, given that we are sort of middle aged,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.480
[Amit Varma]: so I shouldn't, you know, say Roshan is already looking upset because he's young.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.720
[Amit Varma]: Given that we are, you know, late 40s, early 50s, you know, how would you sort of think about,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.040
[Amit Varma]: think about this? Like, how has this changed what you do now, as opposed to you know,

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.320
[Amit Varma]: how you lived your lives when you were young?

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.560
[Guest 1]: So, see, personally, I completely agree with the fact of saying that time becomes a scarce resource

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:01.920
[Guest 1]: over a period of time, I mean, as you age, but somehow, if you really need to keep optimize time

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.280
[Guest 1]: and expand it, the first thing that I started doing very early was I make myself redundant in

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.880
[Guest 1]: every job that I do. I immediately very quickly find a replacement, teach them what I know and

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.320
[Guest 1]: very quickly find a replacement, teach them what I know and move on. Because that's when I again find

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.080
[Guest 1]: that free time available. During the pandemic, I hired two people, I call them my left brain,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:28.880
[Guest 1]: my right brain. And both of these guys actually do 150% of what I do, because 50% of what they do

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.040
[Guest 1]: is stuff I could never do. I'm not good with finance, I'm not very, very good with follow

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.400
[Guest 1]: up on a couple of things. You know, if you really need to analyze things, I react far more, you know,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.400
[Guest 1]: from a creative perspective, I love the idea, but I may not think so much about the execution.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.080
[Guest 1]: So all of these, you know, so they were able to take that on, they are one is 25, one is 24.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.600
[Guest 1]: You know, so I've actually, that's how I'm trying to optimize it to a certain degree. But I do feel

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.960
[Guest 1]: that these two concepts, I mean, if you have to constantly look at life from money and, you know,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:04.720
[Guest 1]: time perspective, I somehow really look at it a little differently. I'm always just trying to see

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:11.040
[Guest 1]: that, can you make your life richer in any way, whether it is meeting up with friends,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.640
[Guest 1]: catching up on conversation, whether it's reading, whether it's writing, whether it's,

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.240
[Guest 1]: you know, going out and doing a play or doing whatever else. But I just think, you know,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.160
[Guest 1]: I think I'm just a huge enthusiast of jumping into doing things in life.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.480
[Guest 1]: Time expands or contracts to fill the space, I think, you know, as work does at the same time.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.960
[Guest 2]: Yeah, so this doesn't apply to me, because I don't see any change in me over the last

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.600
[Guest 2]: 48 years that I'm alive. Because for me, as I mentioned to you in the beginning,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:46.400
[Guest 2]: Amit that my desire was not there. So nothing changed drastically. If I was at eight years,

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.680
[Guest 2]: a certain mindset, which is low attention span, doing whatever's going on on a daily basis. This

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.960
[Guest 2]: is exactly how I live today. There was this eight years in corporate life, that I was a little bit

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.840
[Guest 2]: different because it was a nine to nine routine. After that, I got back to my childhood. So the

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.280
[Guest 2]: transition of going into a corporate job was the only aberration for eight years. After that,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:14.480
[Guest 2]: I'm back because I'm a freelancer. And for me, I've realized that do little, get more output.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.040
[Guest 2]: If you can crack that I have enough and more time for me. So honestly, I can't answer this

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.080
[Guest 2]: question because I have no thoughts I have, I've remained exactly the same.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you mentioned earlier at breakfast that you don't remember anything. So, you know,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.640
[Amit Varma]: every day is a new day. But even then, I mean, the question of no desire, I mean,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.520
[Amit Varma]: I kind of get it in the sense that many people have these long arching ambitions,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.720
[Amit Varma]: and fine, you don't have that. But nevertheless, you have some desires, which is why you kind of

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.120
[Amit Varma]: have the kind of career that you've had, even if you didn't actively plan it out or chase it that

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:55.520
[Amit Varma]: way. So was it just like a series of what was your sort of philosophy and looking back philosophy,

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.320
[Amit Varma]: looking back, but not thinking about it or framing it that way? Was it really a thing of just do

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.800
[Amit Varma]: whatever makes you happy in the moment or jo hoga so hoga? Absolutely. And that came from a fact

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.200
[Guest 2]: that I was exposed to a lot of things. I played cricket for Maharashtra, I played, you know,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.400
[Guest 2]: my mother's a classical musician. So all the cultural aspects were there. So I was getting

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.280
[Guest 2]: this base level happiness any which way. So I didn't have to do ki aage jaake merko yeh concert

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:25.120
[Guest 2]: dekhna hai. Sab mere paas tha so I didn't feel any deep desire to do anything. But at that moment,

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.040
[Guest 2]: I felt ki yaar yeh karke dekhte hain. So there's a difference. I didn't have any specific desire,

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.800
[Guest 2]: but I was curious. Yeh majdaar hai, yeh karke dekhte hain, yeh bhi karte hain. So

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.560
[Guest 2]: in that moment, I was getting my happiness. So why do I have to change the world?

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.560
[Amit Varma]: That was the core philosophy. So you know, Roshan's been on my show before,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.200
[Amit Varma]: and we've explored his childhood and adulthood and so on. I won't say middle age.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.560
[Guest 1]: Though I still believe that we were cheated by that recordist of all our time. Because

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.520
[Guest 1]: just as you're getting into the flow of things, he says, I need to sanitize the studio,

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:59.040
[Guest 1]: I've got a recording at 10. Aur 9 baj gaya tha. I was just like, abhi toh baat shuru hoi thi.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.160
[Amit Varma]: So what basically happened was that Roshan and I did one of those few early recordings before I set

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.960
[Amit Varma]: up my home studio. So I had booked out a studio and I'd taken my four, five hours or whatever

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.520
[Amit Varma]: there. And it was at night. So I assumed ki agar thora extent kar liya, toh theek hai paise waise

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.880
[Amit Varma]: de denge, but time mil jayega. Paisa and time again. But they said, no, no, there's a recording

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:27.840
[Amit Varma]: at 10pm. And I'm still suspicious ki bhai kya tha, kaun aa raha tha 10 pajay. But yeah, so we only

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.560
[Guest 1]: had a four hour conversation, which was very sad. But we should... Again, because with Amit,

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.840
[Guest 1]: those conversations just keep, they can go on. I think if somebody offered to sleep the night here,

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.760
[Guest 1]: woh do din tak chalta rahega. Woh banega, ek 48 hours banne wala hai. Toh yeh hum koshish

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.640
[Guest 2]: karenge abhi. Aur ek interesting tha jab Amit ka email aaya, toh mujhe ek feeling aisa aaya hai ki

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.680
[Guest 2]: the way he had, you know, communicated to us, I got a feeling that abhi intellectuals bahut ho

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:59.120
[Unknown]: gayi. Let me lower the benchmark. Let me lower the benchmark of the show, so that next year,

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:10.720
[Amit Varma]: no, but you know, that's, that's partly what I was aiming for in the sense that not, not that

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.000
[Unknown]: intellectuals bahut ho gayi, they'll all be listening to this and thinking what bahut ho gayi,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.200
[Amit Varma]: mere saath 5 ghante baat kiya. But simply because I think a lot of what happens is a lot of our

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.920
[Amit Varma]: conversations get damn serious and you're lamenting the state of the country and all of that, which

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:30.400
[Amit Varma]: deserves to be lamented. But at the same time, I think that sometimes you also need to celebrate

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.080
[Amit Varma]: the little things that are there and not so much as celebrate in terms of har cheez mein aap

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:40.640
[Amit Varma]: positive dhundo. But just that, you know, I think all of us have in different ways found, you know,

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.520
[Amit Varma]: figured out ways to make sense of the world, find happiness for ourselves. And it's interesting to

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:51.440
[Amit Varma]: sort of for me to look back on that, share the good things and talk about that. And so Vikram,

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.240
[Unknown]: had you had a very tragic life, I may not have called you here, ki kaun sunna chhata hai yaar,

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.920
[Unknown]: ki I was impoverished at the age of eight, main matlab nal chowk pe bheek maangta tha.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:11.200
[Guest 2]: Jaise maine bola tha ki impoverished hoon, probably tha, magar main bhool gaya. So as I've told you that my ability to forget what's

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.640
[Guest 2]: happened in the past, as I told Roshan and you in the morning, that I one day made a list of people

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.160
[Guest 2]: ki inse mujhe badla lena hai, badla ki aag mere. And I forgot why they had done bad things to me.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.960
[Guest 2]: So then I decided to cancel the badla. And then he forgot the list also.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:32.800
[Guest 2]: And I think that is the secret to happiness, low attention span and less memory.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.680
[Amit Varma]: In the manifestations, which you mentioned it, but I'm sure not by themselves, like Roshan will

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:45.920
[Amit Varma]: know on my writing group, which we are part of the WhatsApp group, I mentioned an author yesterday.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.200
[Amit Varma]: And I said that, okay, you know, he's a good guy. I like his work. But two years back, he exploded

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:57.200
[Amit Varma]: at me on social media for something I did, but I couldn't remember why. So I was like, theek hai jaane do, abhi yaad nahi hai, kuch hua hoga.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.640
[Guest 2]: Exactly, toh khush hai na tu.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:05.360
[Amit Varma]: Main toh khush hoon. So to kind of get back to you. So, you know, tell me about your childhood, where did you grow up? Tell me about your mom?

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.440
[Guest 2]: Yeah, so as I said that I don't remember much, but whatever I remember, I'll tell you that

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.520
[Guest 2]: I was a service officer's kid. My dad was in the Air Force. And I remember most of the postings,

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:23.760
[Guest 2]: we were in Bareilly and Jamnagar. And then the best posting we ever had was the National Defense

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:30.320
[Guest 2]: Academy. And that's where I realized that I do not want to join the armed forces because it was a

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.600
[Guest 2]: beautiful resort, but you don't want to be part of it from the active level. And service officers

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:41.680
[Guest 2]: children have always two options, right? Either you get inspired ki hamare pardada bhi army mein hua karte the types

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:47.520
[Guest 2]: or second is bhai apne bas ki baat nahi hai. And that happened to me in the National Defense Academy.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:53.360
[Guest 2]: My dad was, you know, we were on a scooter and the NDA cadets while they are, you know,

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.320
[Guest 2]: going on a cycle next to you, if they see a senior officer or

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.360
[Guest 2]: wife, you're supposed to stretch your arms like this on the cycle, which means that respect diya

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:10.320
[Guest 2]: aapko. Toh we were there and my dad's coursemate, he was also driving and then suddenly he realized

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:15.360
[Guest 2]: that this yeh cadet ne aise haath nahi kiya tha, stretch nahi kiya tha. And he stopped the cadet

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.880
[Guest 2]: and asked him, what's your name? So I don't remember the cadet's name. So it's say, for example,

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:26.800
[Guest 2]: Roshan Abbas. So R-O-S-H aise front roll sabke saamne karnega. And that when I saw, I realized

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:32.480
[Guest 2]: bhai, my dad would start doing this at home. So I'm not going to join the National Defense Academy,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.600
[Guest 2]: but the good news was because you are an Air Force officer's son, you play golf at a young age,

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.240
[Guest 2]: you get exposed to, there's so many cricket grounds there, football grounds. So my love

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.600
[Guest 2]: for sports started at the National Defense Academy. The good news was that some 25 years later,

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.720
[Guest 2]: I performed for the 117th course there. And I told my father, without doing all this effort,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.440
[Guest 2]: see, I'm addressing the entire academy in front of the admiral of the Indian Navy.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:02.800
[Guest 2]: So that's how my childhood was going from one Air Force station to the other. And then one fine day,

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:09.200
[Guest 2]: my parents said ki yaar isko thoda stabilize karke. So we came to Pune. Now, Pune at that

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:14.640
[Guest 2]: point of time was, means, you know, Gokhale, Ranade, Agarkar, that was the background and

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:20.160
[Guest 2]: Gokhale Institute. I know Amit had an interface with that institute. So it was an amazing

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:27.680
[Guest 2]: cosmopolitan world in the armed forces to hardcore Puneri. And I loved it because in the armed

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:33.680
[Guest 2]: forces, you're not exposed to art in that form, right? Everybody, NDA cadets also do a great job

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.880
[Guest 2]: when it comes to theater, music and all of that. But when I came to Pune, I realized that there was

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:44.320
[Guest 2]: this new world, which I loved, which is, you know, getting exposed to going for Sawai Gandharva at

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.240
[Guest 2]: six in the morning. And my mother shifted with me to make sure my education was good. So I

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:54.320
[Guest 2]: was in Karnataka High School. I got introduced to Pula Deshpande, who I believe is the greatest

00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:00.640
[Guest 2]: living legend across the world because nobody is an actor, writer, director, harmonium player,

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:09.600
[Guest 2]: music composer, plus Ran Doordarshan for such a long time and an orator. It's a disrespect to

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:15.600
[Guest 2]: call him a comedian. So from that perspective, Indian classical music and my introduction to

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.720
[Guest 2]: cricket, I started playing at PYC. And that's where I realized that I had a lot of cricket in

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:26.560
[Guest 2]: me mentally, but not physically, because that was the generation of Sachin Tendulkar, unfortunately

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.400
[Guest 2]: for us. And that's the reason I wrote this book, How Sachin Destroyed My Life, which we'll talk

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.120
[Guest 2]: about it later. And I started playing and I realized that I had a good hand-eye coordination.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:42.800
[Guest 2]: I was doing well. The music was going well. I started playing the tabla. So then once I settled

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:48.160
[Guest 2]: in Pune, I got exposed to this world and I was in Narayan Ped, hardcore Peshwa territory,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:56.800
[Guest 2]: where music and arts was flowing. Experimental theater was in a big way there. And then

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.120
[Guest 2]: post that, I joined Ferguson College where I met Amit Verma.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.760
[Guest 1]: That's what I was going to say. I said, Ferguson must have been a common thing for you guys.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, the weird thing is, I don't think we knew each other.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.280
[Amit Varma]: It's only later when we were both working in MTV in the late 90s, 97, 98,

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.880
[Amit Varma]: that we realized that, hey, we are both from Ferguson and we had common friends and all of

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:25.520
[Amit Varma]: that, whom I'm sure he's forgotten. He was like, okay. So we actually became friends then. So it's

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.680
[Amit Varma]: kind of weird. You know, so I can technically call him a college friend, but we didn't know

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:34.080
[Guest 1]: each other in college. My only theory on that would be that you were, as you keep saying,

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.000
[Guest 1]: you're an introvert. So you did what to meet new people. And Sathe was too lazy to meet anyone.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.400
[Guest 2]: No, but you know, I remember him because there was this group of guys who used to play chess

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.440
[Guest 2]: just near the Ferguson canteen. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So behind the gym building. Yeah,

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.440
[Guest 2]: behind the gym building. And I used to see these guys and say, every day they play chess. And he

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.240
[Guest 2]: was a good chess player. And I was a college captain and played for Maharashtra and all of that.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:06.960
[Guest 2]: So I was told that these guys are great. So say hello to them. If you get a chance, do it.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:13.520
[Guest 2]: So that's why I remember Amit very well. And I think, did you ever go to the National Film

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.560
[Guest 2]: Archives, NFAI at some point? I would have gone there to see films. My dad was director of the

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.920
[Guest 2]: FTII. But I would go for the film festivals at NFAI. I think I met you there once. Possible.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. See, I also forget everything. It's a tiny secret. People ask me,

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.280
[Amit Varma]: how is your retention? And I have to tell them that boss, there is a lot of research.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.200
[Amit Varma]: I do all my research one day before the episodes. I don't remember anything after that.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.960
[Guest 1]: So like, I have a strange feeling that slowly this episode is going to become

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:48.960
[Amit Varma]: like Karan Arjun. And you mentioned golf. And I remember like one of my past guests,

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.240
[Amit Varma]: Subrat Mohanty, he was in town, I was hanging out with him. So he told me,

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:57.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, the mantra which bankers go by, which is a 963 formula. Have you heard it?

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.960
[Amit Varma]: No. So the 963 formula is, let me see, I don't want to get it wrong. Yeah. Lend at 9%,

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:12.720
[Amit Varma]: borrow at 6%, golf at 3 o'clock. Since you mentioned golf, and I just realized that Roshan

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:18.480
[Amit Varma]: a little while earlier spoke about how if you get interested in something, time expands to fill the

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.120
[Amit Varma]: work available. And that's actually where it originates from is Parkinson's law,

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.240
[Amit Varma]: is that work expands to fill the time available, which is kind of how I've lived my life. Like,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:33.520
[Amit Varma]: even if I have one thing to do in a day, it will take the whole damn day. So it's, you know, us,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:40.080
[Amit Varma]: lazy buggers. So tell me a bit more about, you know, Vikram, what you wanted to,

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.360
[Amit Varma]: like, when you were going through life like that, you're in a very cultural environment. So you're

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.920
[Amit Varma]: both playing tabla. And I presume singing because you do sing quite well. And you will sing for us

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:55.520
[Amit Varma]: later on the show. And you're also into cricket, and you're kind of picking that up. So at this

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.840
[Amit Varma]: point, you know, what did you think of yourself doing? What was your sort of conception of

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:07.360
[Guest 2]: yourself? So that is the problem, right? I had no conception of anything up until today. So

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:12.720
[Guest 2]: the thing was that my mom was saying that, you know, tabla, keep, you know, and today in my

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.800
[Guest 2]: motivational talks, I talk about the fact that you have to be consistent and blah, blah, blah,

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.840
[Guest 2]: this exactly. So whatever I speak today is not something I did. And that is the reason I have a

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.320
[Guest 2]: gravity of the situation. And I remember having this conversation with Sanjay Manjrekar. And he

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.120
[Guest 2]: said that one of the reasons I can probably analyze the game better is because I was not

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:37.200
[Guest 2]: good enough. And I think he did not say it in these words, but this is what I interpreted,

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.240
[Guest 2]: because this was a conversation I had with him about Sachin Tendulkar. And he said that many a

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:48.720
[Guest 2]: time Sachin Tendulkar did not realize that he was too good to know that there are other people who

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.440
[Guest 2]: may not be as good enough. And therefore you have to plan for them as well. And I realized that my

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:59.200
[Guest 2]: understanding of the environment was better from probably a writer's perspective is because I could

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:05.280
[Guest 2]: not play the on drive as good as the other guy. Sometimes as artists, as sports people, we do

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.120
[Guest 2]: things naturally. And this is a conversation again with Sachin Tendulkar. And I asked him that,

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.400
[Guest 2]: how did you motivate yourself? And he looked at me like, are you even crazy? Are you crazy?

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.440
[Guest 2]: What is motivation? So I said that, you know, you have to push yourself to do. He said, never.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.160
[Unknown]: If you like something, why would you like to, why would you want to push? Now he doesn't realize

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:30.000
[Guest 2]: that nine out of 10 people on a bad day require some kind of an external stimulus to go and do

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.320
[Guest 2]: what they, even if they like that activity. So for me, I realized that, you know, I was liking this,

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.440
[Guest 2]: but there was not that intrinsic desire of putting eight hours. That is the laziness factor that

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:47.040
[Guest 2]: Roshan talked about. But that process of going to Sawai Gandharvan, listening to Pandit Bhimsen Joshi

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:53.840
[Guest 2]: at 6am, that gave me joy. And I thought, I have to stay in this. I have to stay in this joy.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:59.280
[Guest 2]: This doesn't mean that I have to become Pandit Bhimsen Joshi. Now that is something I realized

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.000
[Guest 2]: that this excellence of excellence is fine, but I don't have to do it. But whoever has excellence,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.600
[Guest 2]: if he goes there and stays in the pond, and that is the only reason after Ferguson College, when

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.720
[Guest 2]: we had no idea about, you know, post-grad, what to do, I was playing cricket. I realized that,

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.440
[Guest 2]: you know, my coach had told me that you've got to get at least 300 in that season to even

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.760
[Guest 2]: come to a point where you will compete with the Mumbai guys, because the Mumbai guys were making

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:29.120
[Guest 2]: 2-2,000 runs a season. Even Maharashtra had a fabulous team at that point of time in Ranji

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.160
[Guest 2]: Trophy. So then I realized that, boss, this is not good enough, so I will have to prepare for MBA,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.840
[Guest 2]: because MBA was graduation by that time. You will get a job worth 8-10,000.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:45.840
[Guest 2]: And thankfully, I had a good set of friends, and I always believe that, boss, 5 business relationships

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.800
[Guest 2]: and 5 friends is what you need to survive in life, because you don't have a bandwidth on this.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:56.560
[Guest 2]: I don't have it. After that, you have acquaintances, whom you develop for business, that yes,

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:01.600
[Guest 2]: I will get business from this. But 5 friends and 5 business, and I believe that also has Pareto's

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.560
[Guest 2]: principle. If you look back at Roshan's career, probably there are 5 clients that made his last

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.360
[Guest 2]: company, Encompass. There were a lot of small companies which kind of propelled the 50 lakh,

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.840
[Guest 2]: whatever, small small business, but the big guys like what? The Asian Pay. The Asian Pay. Amit

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:21.360
[Guest 2]: Singles. Amit Singles of the world, exactly. And that applies to life as well, that those 5

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:27.280
[Guest 2]: relationships, if you develop all your life in business and in this thing, and this is something

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:32.640
[Guest 2]: that I kept with. And I said that these are my 4-5 friends, this is what we have to do, we have to

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:38.960
[Guest 2]: stay in the zone, that boss, I like cricket. And then, that is where I think I interacted with

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.440
[Guest 2]: Harsha Bhokle for the first time. And I said that yeah, this is an interesting space. Again, not

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.920
[Guest 2]: because I want to become a commentator and all, but this is a good space. So I was always looking

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.880
[Guest 2]: at spaces, that I want to swim in this pond, I want to swim in this pond, I want to become one or not,

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.240
[Guest 2]: I didn't know, because as I said, I was living those moments at that time. And then my friends

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:03.120
[Guest 2]: gathered together and said that, you know, see again those 5 friends came to me and said,

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:10.000
[Guest 2]: let's study from you, you crack the MBA entrance exam later. You will not believe, there was the

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.160
[Guest 2]: MBA entrance exam and I was not motivated to go for the exam, because I didn't know what I will

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.880
[Guest 2]: do with finance and marketing and sales. There were guys who came to my house, picked me up,

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.800
[Guest 2]: took me to the place where the, you know, they had taken my study, you know, I had taken all the

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:28.800
[Guest 2]: preparation for 15 days. And one of these guys, Sunil Fatak, who is now in the Bay Area, he knew

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:34.880
[Guest 2]: the system inside out, which questions will come. So he told me that also and I got my MBA entrance

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:42.320
[Guest 2]: and it was a premier college. So then I had to do my MBA. There was no option. But by that time,

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:49.680
[Guest 2]: I realized that media is probably a space I need to go to. And thankfully, all these friends,

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.840
[Guest 2]: my cricket friends gathered and said, okay, you know, we will find a way out somewhere

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:59.840
[Guest 2]: to get a career. And guess what, I had done BSc in Geology. You did a BSc in Geology? Yeah,

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.640
[Guest 2]: before that, because what happened was after 12th, everybody was engineering, engineering,

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:10.080
[Guest 2]: so I applied for polymer engineering. And again, my mamaji, this is a funny story, my mama came to

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:16.400
[Guest 2]: me and said that, you know, I don't think it's a good idea, because I have repented. I don't want

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:24.400
[Guest 2]: you to repent. So, and I love my mamaji because he was the one who said that, boss, don't do anything.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.400
[Guest 2]: Everybody in the family, intellectually oriented, you should do this, you should do that,

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:38.480
[Guest 2]: up the benchmark. I didn't have that concept. So the story is that in BSc, I got 5 out of 100

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:44.160
[Guest 2]: in Chemistry. So there was a parent-teacher meeting and my mamaji went to meet the chemistry

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:50.400
[Guest 2]: professor. And I was like, I was really scared, what will he come and stuff like that. I was

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.800
[Guest 2]: outside waiting, what will happen, what will happen, what will happen. And I lied to them

00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:00.000
[Guest 2]: saying that my parents are out of town. And I told mama that please go on behalf of the parents. So

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.120
[Guest 2]: he had also said, okay, I will handle this. And he came out of that parent-teacher meeting,

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:10.960
[Guest 2]: and he hugged me. So I said, why is he hugging me 5 out of 100, it's embarrassing. He said,

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:20.080
[Guest 2]: the one before you had 3 out of 100. I'm proud of you. So that is the relationship I had with my

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.000
[Guest 1]: mama. You know, I think in every family, there is a person like this. Yeah. You know,

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:30.560
[Guest 1]: one set of overachievers, one who is living life. No, no, because he must have suffered.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.600
[Guest 1]: That's what I'm saying. He sees that another one is dying. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. In

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:41.600
[Guest 2]: every family, there is one of these. Relax, chill, life will be fine. Exactly. So he, I mean,

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.720
[Guest 2]: to complete the story, he told me not to do engineering. But then there was a balance,

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:52.880
[Guest 2]: you had to satisfy people at home. So it can't be arts, it can't be commerce, it has to be science.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:59.360
[Guest 2]: So there was BSc, which is the most disastrous course in the history of mankind. Because you

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:05.520
[Guest 2]: neither here nor there. You don't have the capacity for R&D. So basically, you have to do BSc. Then

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:12.160
[Guest 2]: in BSc, physics, chemistry, the problem was nothing mattered. So can't study matter.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.200
[Guest 2]: So then geology is now, when I look back, geology was a very interesting subject. But at that time,

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:28.320
[Guest 2]: what to see inside the rock, inside the mineral, but finally I did that. And I remember my

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.560
[Guest 2]: grandmother introducing me, typical Marathi family people coming home and said,

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.440
[Guest 2]: what has your grandson? Ordinary BSc.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:50.480
[Guest 2]: How can you introduce me? Ordinary. Ordinary BSc. For her, it meant that his career is over,

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:56.800
[Guest 2]: he has done ordinary BSc. And there was this look on her face that it's over. So in Pune,

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:03.360
[Guest 2]: you could not have done BSc, it was a complete failure. But thankfully, in that process, I

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:10.720
[Guest 2]: realized that even with MBA, I should not be doing the standard stuff. And that's why when I came to

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:17.120
[Guest 2]: campus, I was one of the toppers and I did not get the companies that I wanted. Coke and Hindustan

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:23.680
[Guest 2]: Lever at that point of time, my CV was shortlisted. And I decided I will go on my own.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.880
[Guest 2]: And guess what? I went to Mumbai in 1997. And I started a wrestling company.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.880
[Amit Varma]: News to both of us.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:43.040
[Guest 2]: When I got my MBA, Jerry Maguire was there and Mark McCormack.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.040
[Guest 2]: By that time, I had clarity that if there is an interface between management and sports,

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:54.800
[Guest 2]: then what will happen? So obviously, watching the movie, I thought that this is a new problem,

00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:00.080
[Guest 2]: right? Everybody is watching English Premier League. And now every kid in urban India believes

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:05.120
[Guest 2]: that he is going to take the football coach's job at Manchester United or Arsenal. And so I get a

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:11.520
[Guest 2]: call every week from some friend's son who's saying, uncle, I want to be in football. So

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:18.400
[Guest 2]: then suddenly I'll hear, why? You know, I want to do something because we lost. I said, who lost?

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:25.680
[Guest 2]: Puddar College? No, he said, Arsenal. So look at the construct of patriotism now.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.080
[Guest 2]: Where does patriotism come from? You know, you play for your college. I played for PYC,

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:35.200
[Guest 2]: I played for Ferguson, I was patriotic. Now this fellow in Ghatkopar is patriotic about Chelsea.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.840
[Guest 2]: And he wants to be the manager there. But that happened to me. That happened to me and I wanted

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:46.000
[Guest 2]: to head IMG, Mark McCormack, because he, you know, ran all the businesses, business of sport.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:53.120
[Guest 2]: And that's what drove me to Mumbai. And that point of time Premchand Degra had become Mr. Universe.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:59.360
[Guest 2]: You know, not wrestling as such, but it was bodybuilding, which went to wrestling and

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.680
[Guest 2]: Arnold Schwarzenegger's book I had read at that point of time, along with Dorian Yates,

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:11.520
[Guest 2]: was the bodybuilder's supreme. And one of my friends came to me that, I want to bring Mr. Universe to Mumbai.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:18.160
[Guest 2]: I said, super idea. So then we contacted Mr. Universe, the franchisee, and they said that,

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.120
[Guest 2]: you know, we look at you. So I met at that time, instead of doing your summer training or whatever,

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:30.400
[Guest 2]: I met the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. And I told him that was Narayan Rane.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.720
[Guest 2]: I said, I want to bring Mr. Universe. He said, what do you want to bring?

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:42.880
[Guest 2]: Bring him. As if I was getting some like, you know, some guy's invitation to come in a plane.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:49.280
[Guest 2]: But that kind of, you know, but that six months was very important because I realized at that time

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:55.680
[Guest 2]: that the sports business is not to do with actually organizing sports. It was about television.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:01.280
[Guest 2]: And for me, it was important that, you know, to join television to understand the sporting business.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:08.080
[Guest 2]: And that's where, you know, we, the MTB offer happened. And I used to do summer training at,

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:13.120
[Guest 2]: you know, a company called Plus Channel during my stint and which was owned by Mahesh Bhatt.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:20.480
[Guest 2]: And there I met… Mukesh Khanna? No, no. What was it? Amit… Amit Khanna. Amit Khanna, Mahesh Bhatt.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:26.960
[Guest 2]: Amit Khanna, Mahesh Bhatt. And there was this movie they had done called Papa Kehte Hain, whose soundtrack was excellent, actually.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:45.040
[Guest 2]: I was there at this recording. Oh, wow. Amazing. And then I said, man, this is an interesting area.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:51.200
[Guest 2]: Obviously, Bollywood regular exposure was there. But I said that this is an interesting area that

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.880
[Guest 2]: I should probably look at in the future. And there was this American, Japanese boss who you know very

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:05.760
[Amit Varma]: well, Niren Hiromi. He's a character. MTB marketing head. Legend. I remember a story that he was the

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:12.240
[Guest 2]: one who taught me, you know, fundamentals of marketing. So what is an ad? Dude, headline,

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:18.720
[Guest 2]: body copy, baseline, out. So he was teaching me this whole principle of advertising in the car

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:24.160
[Guest 2]: one day. And we were going past Prabhadevi. And there was this creative guy also sitting, Pankaj,

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.720
[Guest 2]: next to me. And he was saying, you know, this is how the logo should be. Dude, you got to get this

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:35.920
[Guest 2]: right, this right. And suddenly we look outside and there is a Shiv Sena poster on the side,

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:42.400
[Guest 2]: Prabhadevi's signal. There is Tiger and there is Bada Saheb Thackeray. He suddenly like, dude,

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:52.000
[Guest 2]: who cleared that layout? And I was like, this guy is so funny. He actually got me into MTB.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:00.080
[Guest 2]: But before that, again, my love for Mark McCormack made me join professional management group. So

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:05.200
[Guest 2]: what happened during the time when I was playing cricket, I had befriended Samir Dige. Samir Dige

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:11.120
[Guest 2]: was then Mumbai captain and he played for Mumbai with Sachin and the whole amazing gang, Nilesh

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:16.800
[Guest 2]: Kulkarni, Paras Mamre, Salil Ankola. The story that Salil Ankola, every time I meet him even

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:22.160
[Guest 2]: today, I'm scared of him because a ball that was pitch short, I still have the bruise in my

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:29.280
[Guest 2]: chest because he was very, very quick at that point of time, very strong lad. And yeah, so

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:34.000
[Guest 2]: Samir Dige, I knew and I called him and I said that, you know, I started this company and all.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.760
[Guest 2]: And I don't know what to do, but I want to be in cricket. So he introduced me to Hemant Kinkre.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:45.360
[Guest 2]: Hemant Kinkre is Sunil Gavaskar's cousin. And he was earlier married to Asha Bhusle's daughter.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:52.240
[Guest 2]: Fabulous cricketer, good batsman for CCI. He said that, you know, I'll introduce you to Mr. Gavaskar

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.640
[Guest 2]: and Sumedh Shah, who ran professional management group, which was the only company at that point

00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:02.240
[Guest 2]: of time, which kind of resembled, you know, this cricketing world and management kind of a world.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:08.000
[Guest 2]: I met Harsha that time and I met Harsha and told him that, you know, I want to be in this space.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.440
[Guest 2]: He said, you work in PMG. I also worked there years back. So you'll get some basic exposure there.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:21.440
[Guest 2]: But it was a year's stint with that's where I started imitating Sunil Gavaskar. And, you know,

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:26.080
[Guest 2]: I used to do this in front of Vaishali Hotel. I don't know, Amit will not remember that I used

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:33.200
[Guest 2]: to gather a crowd imitating cricketers. And that is where that theater, music, cricket all came

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.160
[Guest 1]: together. And you're still at MTV at this time? No, no, no, I have not joined MTV yet. Oh my God.

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:44.080
[Guest 2]: So this is a stint before? This is a stint before just 8 to 10 months trying to see whether the

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.560
[Guest 2]: sports business really exists. And I realized that there is no sports business in India.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.960
[Guest 2]: I think the sports business in India started after IPL. Till that time, it was only BCCI.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.640
[Guest 2]: There is no business. BCCI tells you what to do, you do. If you call it business,

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.760
[Guest 2]: then it's good for you. Otherwise, there's nothing else. Then I worked with Mr. Gavaskar

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:06.640
[Guest 2]: and I realized that there is nothing here. And television is what I need to do. That's

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.360
[Guest 1]: what brought me to music television. Did you get Mr. Universe?

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:18.320
[Guest 2]: No, because it was a wrong idea.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.560
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of things I want to sort of double click on before we continue with the chronology.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:30.160
[Amit Varma]: And one of them is very interesting where you, you know, you speak about how when you were playing

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.480
[Amit Varma]: cricket, it was obvious to you that you're not, you know, going to be at that level. And I remember,

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:39.680
[Amit Varma]: I retired from chess as a 19 year old in the early 90s, when I kind of came to the same

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:46.080
[Amit Varma]: realization. So, you know, what is the point? And also in the particular club where I played,

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.480
[Amit Varma]: which was a fatke club in Pune in the early 90s, there were these couple of kids who were really

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.640
[Amit Varma]: good, much better than me. So I thought, okay, kids here are beating me, what's the chance outside?

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:58.640
[Amit Varma]: Then one became a grandmaster, one became a master. So, you know, I shouldn't have been

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:04.160
[Amit Varma]: too hard on myself. But the thing here is that in sport, you know, when you're not good,

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:10.720
[Amit Varma]: because you're getting that instant feedback, ki, you know, Salil Ankula ne bol ki, ribs pe laga,

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:17.120
[Amit Varma]: abhi, you know, I can't walk properly for two days. But in art, that feedback loop isn't there.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.680
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, what happens is that a lot of people who get into the arts, whether they are

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.520
[Amit Varma]: singing or writing or whatever, they think they are much better than they are. Now, there are two

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:29.680
[Amit Varma]: sides to this. And the negative side is you can waste a lot of time doing something you're not

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:34.960
[Amit Varma]: cut out for, because you don't have the self awareness. But the positive side is that you

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.640
[Amit Varma]: don't know that you suck, because everybody sucks at the start, whenever they do something,

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:44.720
[Amit Varma]: you don't know that you suck. So you continue. And just the sheer hard work that you then put in

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.040
[Amit Varma]: and the sheer repetition actually makes you good at it. Basically, you fake it till you make it.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.680
[Amit Varma]: Like when I think of myself as a writer in my 20s, my writing was shit, and I didn't have the

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:59.680
[Amit Varma]: judgment to know it. So you know, I, you know, I wrote bad things, I thought I was a cat's whiskers.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:04.080
[Amit Varma]: But it's a good thing because I you know, that self delusion just kind of keeps you going.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:10.240
[Amit Varma]: So these seem to me to be two very different ways in which it plays out that in sport,

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:16.000
[Amit Varma]: you know exactly where you are. And you know, the work you need to do to get ahead. And that's got

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.320
[Amit Varma]: his good and bad aspects. And the good aspect of that is you can work hard and get there.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.400
[Amit Varma]: And the bad aspect of that is that you can get disheartened, maybe you could have been something

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.720
[Amit Varma]: good, but you don't put in the work. Whereas in the arts, again, there's the same thing,

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.400
[Amit Varma]: you don't know that feedback loop is in there. And it can work in both good and bad ways.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:38.000
[Guest 2]: I think it's a very important point that in sport, the metric is very clear. It's runs,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:45.040
[Guest 2]: it's what you see, right. And in that under 15 game in Mumbai, when I saw Tendulkar play,

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:52.240
[Guest 2]: when I saw Vinod play, and while we were grafting, you know, scoring, say 25 runs in 40 balls, and

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:58.960
[Guest 2]: we thought the conditions were difficult. And here was a guy who had scored 120 not out in the first,

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:03.840
[Guest 2]: you know, first one or one and a half, two hours, and he left that match and went to Thane and

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:10.080
[Guest 2]: scored another 100 runs. So the benchmark was like, so high, that you were like, you're not

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.520
[Guest 2]: even in the play 11, boss, you should not be playing this game. So the metric is very, very

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:20.320
[Guest 2]: clear. In art, there is a very complex problem, right? Because art, you don't know what the

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:26.720
[Guest 2]: metric is, you also work on conviction. And everybody tells you that, boss, like, you know,

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:31.840
[Guest 2]: as a filmmaker, also Roshan would tell you that many a times I've seen and I worked in the movie

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:37.920
[Guest 2]: industry for a couple of years as well, that what is the line where you say, boss, mere creative ko

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:44.080
[Guest 2]: as a director, I trust. But people are telling you that your script is faulty. But no, you have to

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.200
[Guest 2]: take a call. Should you listen to the person because they say the script is faulty, or because

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.160
[Guest 2]: you've been also told that a creator has to have conviction in doing your creative work. This is

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:59.440
[Guest 1]: where the problem arises. No, I have a slight disagreement on this, which is the fact of saying

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.600
[Guest 1]: that, you know, when you when you work in the creative and saying that, you know, you don't

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.800
[Guest 1]: know whether you're good or you're bad or whatever, not true. What happens is, if you make your art

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:14.640
[Guest 1]: incestuous, if you only listen to either yourself or a few people who may be yes or yes people

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.760
[Guest 1]: around you, you're, you know, you can be in that loop of never knowing how you are. But if you put

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:25.280
[Guest 1]: your art to test, I can be using my cricket bat sitting inside my room and constantly practicing,

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.520
[Guest 1]: you know, what some stroke or the other, but till I don't go out and actually do it, you will never

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:34.320
[Guest 1]: get to know. In art, I mean, and personally, I'll tell you this, that when I moved from Lucknow to

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:39.120
[Guest 1]: Delhi, and when I first went out and said, I can think I'm a great debater, or I can take part in

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.520
[Guest 1]: the debate. If I lose every debate in the world, then obviously I'm not a good debater. I can get

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.000
[Guest 1]: on to radio, which is what I did next or whatever and stuff. And, you know, if I'm not moved into

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.600
[Guest 1]: A grade recording artist within three months, so, you know, I actually always set these little

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.920
[Guest 1]: targets for myself. Okay, boss, now this TV anchoring is going on. I remember at that time

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:02.560
[Guest 1]: with Oprah, there used to be this other, there was this male, Phil Donahue. And Donahue used to do an

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.760
[Guest 1]: interview. And one of Donahue's articles turned and said that a great career if you're on TV,

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:13.360
[Guest 1]: is that if you're lucky, you'll get 10 years. If you're great, you might get so if you're lucky,

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.640
[Guest 1]: you'll get five, if you're great, you'll get 10. And if you're God, you might end up getting more.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:21.520
[Guest 1]: So, you know, so immediately when I 25, I did television, I said, boss, 35, but this ain't

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:29.200
[Guest 1]: going to end. It might not be God, but I'll manage. So I said 10 years. So I said that as a target,

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:33.520
[Guest 1]: you know, and I sometimes feel this that if you don't, I was at Edinburgh, you know, in August,

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.720
[Guest 1]: you're not just doing your show, you're on the road selling your show, you're standing out there

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.800
[Guest 1]: every day and saying, come see my show, come see my show and the number of people who come to your

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:48.960
[Guest 1]: show, then are the people who will go and tell the next set of people. So, you know, the problem is

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:53.600
[Guest 1]: this that very often when you get incestuous about, I remember Public Demand was a show I used to do,

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.120
[Guest 1]: I used to go out on the road, shoot every day and whatever. One day we got lazy.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:00.880
[Guest 1]: We had a segment left. And because we used to be produced by TV18 in those days,

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.720
[Guest 1]: there were a bunch of TV18 interns standing outside. So the cameraman and my director said,

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.480
[Guest 1]: let's shoot here. And we shot with all of those people, got fabulous bites.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.600
[Guest 1]: And it went into the episode. Raghav Bahl, who was the head of TV18, along with Rishi,

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:18.320
[Guest 1]: was the creative director, used to put up these things on the wall as a review. And I still

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:23.120
[Guest 1]: remember he put up this review and he said, I saw the latest episode of Public Demand, love this,

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:28.240
[Guest 1]: this, this, this. And by the way, that last segment is being shot with our people. If you

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:33.280
[Guest 1]: become so incestuous with your production, you will, if it is meant to be Public Demand, where's

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:42.480
[Guest 1]: the public? You know, and it really struck home for me saying that if you don't keep testing that

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:48.960
[Guest 1]: boundary, I worked with Vikram for years on end, right? I have seen him test that boundary. The

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.000
[Guest 1]: first time it was just an impression of X, then it became X plus Y. Then he heard a bunch of us

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.800
[Guest 1]: doing singing act. He never used to do a singing act before. He heard it and he said, I can do better

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:02.800
[Guest 1]: than you. And he added that. Then he saw there was, you know, I mean, I've actually tracked him

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.960
[Guest 1]: through this all because I've done it so well. But I've seen him do that. He's challenged every

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:12.480
[Guest 1]: boundary, tested it, whatever didn't work, he dropped it. You're conscious of your art. You know,

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:18.240
[Guest 1]: this conceit of art that happens sometimes, you get stuck in that. So I keep saying, my only

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.960
[Guest 1]: thing is, I'm saying, whatever you do, keep testing. If you were not able to make money from the

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.880
[Guest 1]: podcast today, Amit, with all the circles you created around it, at some point in time, you

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:32.640
[Guest 1]: turn and say, either I'm doing it for myself or I'll leave it. But in this, Roshan, there are two

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:38.800
[Guest 2]: kinds of situations. One is in the short term, like what happens in performing art, you get a

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:44.720
[Guest 2]: metric. In stand-up comedy, performing art, you get a metric. If someone doesn't laugh in an art show,

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:50.720
[Guest 2]: then you know that you're not good enough or you have to up the game. But in long-form art,

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:56.480
[Guest 2]: which is maybe a book, writing a book or making a film, making theater, what happens is there are

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:01.920
[Guest 2]: a lot of phases during that process where you are going by conviction. You're not able to take

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:07.120
[Guest 2]: feedback because you have to decide whether you want to do this or not. And that is where I think

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:12.480
[Guest 2]: many a times people have a problem because it's not there. But it's going on with conviction. But

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.400
[Guest 1]: after the movie comes, it feels like this is not it. And also I'll tell you, with Mr. Javed,

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.640
[Guest 1]: you know, all the work that I did. Once I remember, he has a poem in Tarkash,

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:27.920
[Guest 1]: gin gin ke sikke haath mera khurdura hua, jaati rahi lumps ki nami, bura hua. You know,

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:34.320
[Guest 1]: I was so busy counting money that at some point I lost the sensitivity. I lost all feeling. Very

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:39.200
[Guest 1]: often when we and see, we've been through this thing. We are sensitive to the world outside.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:43.440
[Guest 1]: We're sensitive to all reaction. I mean, we react to everything else that's happening around us,

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:49.840
[Guest 1]: which creates, which in some sense, you know, provokes our art or creates our art. After a

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.600
[Guest 1]: point in time when you lose that focus and you move ahead. See, when you talk of cricket also,

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:58.720
[Guest 1]: here's this guy who's bowling really, really well. But there's also this guy who is just

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:06.320
[Guest 1]: practicing the bowling 24-7. He's also a good player. Now, your assumption, Zakir also said

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:12.320
[Guest 1]: a big thing in the show, that your success, you measure it from where you started.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:18.480
[Guest 1]: Don't measure it from where you have reached. Because if I say today that I am rich and then

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:23.280
[Guest 1]: I will compare with Ambani, then where am I? But from where I started. If you can at least

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.920
[Guest 1]: do some kind of a progress report of what you have done, where you've reached, look at what you I

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.680
[Guest 1]: mean, look at where you've reached. Or I mean, Amit, when he talks about his podcasting, I hate

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:37.120
[Guest 1]: the 30 minute format, because today the format has evolved to where it is. But it has also evolved

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:42.000
[Guest 1]: because you've got feedback, you've got constant, I mean, I think you build so many feedback loops

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.960
[Amit Varma]: and building feedback loops into anything you do. But you know, okay, so I'll all of which is

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:53.200
[Amit Varma]: correct. And I agree with that. But I'll add a layer to that, which is that with a sportsperson,

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.360
[Amit Varma]: with a cricketer, if you're a batsman, there is one metric, it is an objective metric, it is how

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.360
[Amit Varma]: many runs you're making, you can get unlucky in one innings or whatever, but over a decent sample

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:06.560
[Amit Varma]: size, pata chal jata hai ki, you know, kya level hai. With art, the problem is that there are two

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:14.080
[Amit Varma]: different kinds of metrics, right? And one is the metric of just immediate popularity, that you're

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:18.080
[Amit Varma]: getting the talis now, you're getting the numbers now, and that is one kind of metric and you do

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:23.120
[Amit Varma]: what and you you know, you focus on that and you do whatever it takes to get you there. The other

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:28.800
[Amit Varma]: is a metric where you are really sort of not catering to that mass, where you're saying ki

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:33.360
[Amit Varma]: mujhe niche pakarna hai ya mujhe niche banana hai from scratch, there's no niche there, but I will

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.000
[Amit Varma]: make it, you know, people who have a certain sensibility who will appreciate what you do,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.080
[Amit Varma]: where you say that those numbers don't matter. And therefore, the metric of mass popularity

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:48.080
[Amit Varma]: doesn't matter. And you're catering to something else, which at that moment is invisible. Like,

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:53.760
[Amit Varma]: for example, if I had to go by the mass popularity method by what I the feedback I was getting

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:58.640
[Amit Varma]: through the feedbacks loop I had, everybody would have said do one hour episodes. In fact,

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:04.000
[Amit Varma]: initially do 20 minute episodes, you know, the point that I do the long episodes that I do

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.240
[Amit Varma]: is because I stuck to saying that I will do what I want to do. And, you know, and that will attract

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:15.200
[Amit Varma]: audience of a similar sensibility to me. And the only way I can become good at it is by doing it

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:20.320
[Amit Varma]: again and again. So even if I'm initially there is no feedback in that direction, I have to keep

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:24.480
[Guest 1]: doing it. But that Amitna is somewhere that I'm saying that see that that that feedback that was

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:30.320
[Guest 1]: coming to you was not listener feedback. It was supposed people who know podcasting, when no one

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.720
[Guest 1]: knew podcasting at that time in India. That's true. It's the Balaji problem of Netflix. Wherever any

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.720
[Guest 1]: place you go now in OTT, there is a set of people who thought they knew storytelling and boss,

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.680
[Guest 1]: we used to know GC. GC's format was different, GC's pattern was different, GC was appointment

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:48.720
[Guest 1]: viewing. Now it's a choice. Now if you apply that metric somewhere else, you went by your

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:55.840
[Guest 1]: conviction, but ultimately the conviction got ratification by today that those mad fans of

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.680
[Guest 1]: yours everywhere. I mean, I see those meetups that are happening in cities where you're traveling.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:06.000
[Guest 1]: It is that ratification. It is Sathe being called by Sachin to his house saying imitate me. That

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.640
[Guest 2]: is the ultimate ratification. But you know, Amit, you're making a very, very important point and

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:16.640
[Guest 2]: that is something that you suffer because you put your marketing lens. I remember having a

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:21.360
[Guest 2]: conversation with Vijay Tendulkar, the great playwright and you know that thanks to Pune,

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:31.440
[Guest 2]: right? I became friends with Tendulkar. You know every Tendulkar boss. So thanks to that background

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:36.560
[Guest 2]: and knowing people from the theater industry, Tendulkar, Dubey had kind of become my personal

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:40.800
[Guest 2]: friends in my house in Bandra. They would come, they would have a drink with me, share stories

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:47.200
[Guest 2]: from when he wrote Gidhade and Ghashiram Kotwal. And he used to always tell me when I used to ask

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:54.400
[Guest 2]: him that, you know, what drove your writing? He said, mala hai vata. This is what I wanted to

00:48:54.400 --> 00:49:01.840
[Guest 2]: tell a story. Now, the moment you go into consumer feedback and you put your marketing hat and then

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.400
[Guest 2]: you do a quintessential marketing thing that has been taught to us, what does the youth want?

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:13.760
[Guest 2]: Jab se main youth tha abhi tak, the only question in marketing conferences, what does the youth

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:19.840
[Guest 2]: want? But the moment you go into the lens of what the audience wants, I think you start killing your

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:26.320
[Guest 2]: creativity. Because the genesis of creativity is coming from what I have felt from the surroundings

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:30.800
[Guest 2]: in my Nature Nurture journey. And I am now putting it into a format which is called art,

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:36.000
[Guest 2]: whether it's performing art or whatever it is. And in that process, now when I put a lens of

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.360
[Guest 2]: defeats the purpose. And the problem is your first creative work is what you feel.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:56.160
[Guest 2]: And unfortunately, most creative work after that is what people want. When you turn into a marketer

00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:01.280
[Guest 2]: from a creative and very few creative people are able to maintain that integrity, probably because

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:06.400
[Guest 2]: they've got success in a big way in the initial phase of their career because of the original

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:11.520
[Guest 2]: stuff that they created, that they can afford to follow their creative field. The moment you go

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:18.640
[Guest 2]: that, you know, my market research tells me that 15 to 24 require this kind of humor.

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.240
[Guest 2]: And I think that the point that you make there is very critical is that

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:45.120
[Guest 2]: how does a creative person figure this challenge out? And that challenge for a creative remains forever.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:50.800
[Guest 1]: No, no, but see that's what I'm saying that there has to be, so do not give in to the fact of

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:57.920
[Guest 1]: oh, the market is asking for this. But I'm saying, over a period of time, you get a set of people

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:04.800
[Guest 1]: who you know are giving you, like, I mean, you know, you have a set of people who you will

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:10.480
[Guest 1]: turn to for advice. We'll occasionally have those conversations, right? And I think building this

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:15.440
[Guest 1]: virtuous circle around you is an important thing. The second thing which is really important is,

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:21.040
[Guest 1]: I think is, a great cricketer should be able to play all three formats, true or not true?

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.480
[Guest 1]: Not true because it's a different sport.

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:25.600
[Guest 1]: Exactly, right? Now, that's what I'm saying. So, is he not a great cricketer?

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:30.240
[Guest 1]: If he didn't serve, no. So, is it a matter of conviction or is it a matter of choice?

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:35.600
[Guest 1]: So, I'm just saying that he knows how to play cricket. He's playing very well in the test.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:41.680
[Guest 1]: One couldn't play. He didn't play T20. He's playing T20 very well. The other one couldn't play. Now,

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:46.960
[Guest 1]: is he, therefore, I'm saying that, see, success is not the lens of, it's not the measure on this.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:52.320
[Guest 1]: Ultimately, it has to be, I know this craft and I'm doing enough with the craft. I tried this. I

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.520
[Guest 1]: tried this. I mean, I'm telling you, I'm such a big believer in experimentation and trying new

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:02.480
[Guest 1]: things, which is actually exactly the opposite. We have this thing all the time. You do a lot.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:09.040
[Guest 1]: You know, if you don't do it, where will you see that new world? If Amit hadn't started clear

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:14.800
[Guest 1]: writing, I mean, I'm still dying to see your TikTok course, which we were doing on WhatsApp.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:20.480
[Guest 1]: Because I want to know what was your view on it. Even today, when I'm in Dubai on another phone,

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:25.040
[Guest 1]: I'm watching TikTok because I want to know what is that short form format? Is there anything I

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:30.080
[Guest 1]: could do there? Should I do it? Not for money. The minute commerce enters the equation is very

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:35.120
[Guest 1]: different. Just for the second, I mean, I was doing this play. What was it? It was just testing.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:40.480
[Guest 1]: Can I do it? It's completely different. It's a mad challenge. I won't get the money. It's a theater,

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:45.440
[Guest 1]: but it's a learning process. And he does the same. You do the same. Commerce lens,

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:50.080
[Guest 1]: for Satya, it's not a commerce lens because for him, it's a thing. I could have slept for so long.

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:57.600
[Guest 2]: That is so true. I do it. There's a time when he was doing 20 shows a month. And then,

00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:04.960
[Guest 1]: now I'm tired. Should I do it? Make it? No. And that is him because that time away,

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:09.200
[Guest 1]: when he's sitting at home and he does these meetings in Pune, or he's doing, you know,

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:16.640
[Guest 1]: work around spot is when you're actually fermenting new ideas, create, that is the joy. That I think

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:21.600
[Guest 2]: is really the best part of the process. And I think, you know, consumer feedback is a problem

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:27.120
[Guest 2]: for creative. Big problem. And I would like to believe that in the past during, even in Bollywood,

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:31.840
[Guest 2]: if you say the, you know, time when Raj Kapoor and, you know, your metric of failure was only

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:37.600
[Guest 2]: box office. People didn't, it was not like the social media technology changed the game completely

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:41.200
[Guest 2]: because now you are getting negative feedback from people who have no understanding. They've

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:46.240
[Guest 2]: not even seen your work. And that's a problem because today, if Raj Kapoor made a bad film

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:51.280
[Guest 2]: or, you know, Prithviraj Kapoor did some bad play or whatever. It wasn't fun. That's all the

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:57.920
[Guest 2]: feedback we used to get. Today, the problem is that the creative is afraid to cross the creative boundary.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.880
[Guest 2]: Because he's saying, no, this is on social media. These people curse. I'll make a meme of this type,

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:07.360
[Guest 2]: that will work better. And I think the biggest challenge, the good thing about technology,

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:12.560
[Guest 2]: we discovered more creative people. That was the good thing. But I think good creative people

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:18.960
[Guest 2]: are going to get scared to put out newer forms of creative work only because it's not popular.

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:23.200
[Amit Varma]: So when I used to teach my podcasting course, I remember at one point, somebody asked a question,

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:28.560
[Amit Varma]: sir, where are the gaps in the market? And I was like, boss, this is a very wrong view.

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.960
[Amit Varma]: Because if there are gaps in the market, a million people will go for them, find them,

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:40.240
[Amit Varma]: do whatever. The point is, the only thing that makes you unique among the 7 billion people on

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:44.640
[Amit Varma]: the planet is you. So you just be authentic to yourself and do what you have to do. Now,

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:51.200
[Amit Varma]: the thing with feedback loops also is that they take a long period of time. Like honestly, Roshan,

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:57.040
[Amit Varma]: even with my podcast first three or four years, even, I had no idea that I was doing something

00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:00.800
[Amit Varma]: which was really valued by people. It was just, you know, I liked it, I kept doing it, I got some

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:05.600
[Amit Varma]: feedback, I felt good. It was only after COVID when I said, okay, whoever wants to, you know,

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:11.120
[Amit Varma]: contribute financially to the show, you can do so, open that page. Suddenly, month one, I was like,

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:16.160
[Amit Varma]: like, what is happening, you know, that's when I kind of realized. And then with the clear writing

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:19.760
[Amit Varma]: course, when people signed up, that's when I kind of began to interface with those people and

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:24.240
[Amit Varma]: realized that it means so much to so many people. But otherwise, it is a completely dispersed thing.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:29.840
[Amit Varma]: And I have no idea. But once I know, then I can double down on the things that I find of value in

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:36.000
[Amit Varma]: it. And what you're saying what creators Vikram is so true, because if you are chasing the numbers,

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.200
[Amit Varma]: everybody is going to the lowest common denominator. And secondly, today, we are in a space

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:46.240
[Amit Varma]: where AI is going to do that way better than us. You know, if you look at and friends,

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:50.640
[Amit Varma]: abhi toh GPT 3.5 chal raha hai, but GPT 4, some friends of mine have seen it in private, and they

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:55.120
[Amit Varma]: are raving about it. They're saying it's mad. And, you know, we are recording this at the

00:55:55.760 --> 00:56:02.080
[Amit Varma]: start of December, but what we so even the GPT we see today is not at the level it will, you know,

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:07.760
[Amit Varma]: it's going to just exponentially get better. So I think for an artist, you know, you have to

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.840
[Amit Varma]: not chase gaps in the market, as it were, but just do.

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.400
[Guest 1]: To add to what you said, or whatever, this morning, I saw something incredible. There's a

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:20.400
[Guest 1]: show called Wednesday, which is currently taking the world by storm and whatever, you know, and,

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:26.560
[Guest 1]: and I wonder who watches what nowadays, because it's crazy. Now, Jenna Ortega, this girl who's

00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:34.000
[Guest 1]: in the show, who in the last 10 days, has gone to from 2.3 million followers to 12.3, a million

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.040
[Guest 1]: followers every day she's added, she's just acting in the show. She's a brilliant actress, what she's

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:43.440
[Guest 1]: doing, I think she really gives so much to the character, but it's directed by Tim Burton.

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:48.240
[Guest 1]: Tim Burton's vision is visible in every frame that you see.

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.480
[Guest 1]: Aur ek zamane mein woh cult tha, mass nahi tha.

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.760
[Guest 1]: Boss, Edward Scissorhand, etc. ke time pe aap keh rahe the, oh,

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.640
[Guest 1]: Beetlejuice, kya ho raha hai. But that's what I'm saying, but you know, he has conviction in himself.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:04.080
[Guest 1]: Jenna Ortega will find it very difficult after Wednesday gets over, though it'll obviously run

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:08.320
[Guest 1]: into multiple seasons, to, that when she does her next work, if it doesn't get this appreciated,

00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:13.280
[Guest 1]: because this dopamine hitna of constant like, like, like, like jo hai, which is why I say that

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:17.760
[Guest 1]: over a period of time, mein toh yaar kuch 15 ghar ghar chuka ho, toh mujhe pata hota hai,

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:23.920
[Guest 1]: I've been, you know, people say, oh, so, I said, nahi, boss, aapko success dikhti hai, failure

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:28.880
[Guest 1]: mujhe dik chuka hai, bohot baar dikha hai, chhoti chhoti cheezon mein dikha hai, yeh show banaya,

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:34.240
[Guest 1]: nahi chala, yeh kara nahi chala, film mein kara nahi chala, yeh hua. But the fact is that I'm

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:40.240
[Guest 1]: constantly keeping up with this whole space of saying, try new things, have a set of people,

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:44.480
[Guest 1]: and it's not, I'm not asking you for feedback, but even if I have the conversation with you,

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:50.080
[Guest 2]: there is enough to take away. See, the problem is that everybody, whether you are a theater actor,

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:55.920
[Guest 2]: whether you are, you know, say, Bollywood actor, whether you are probably, you know, making,

00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:02.560
[Guest 2]: you're a sculptor, everybody can't get an 8 billion audience. And this is a standard problem

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:08.000
[Guest 2]: that we have even in sport. And many times I go and I'm talking about the game, everybody says,

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.280
[Guest 2]: sir, you are cricket, you don't know how wrestlers are suffering, you don't know how chess players

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:19.280
[Guest 2]: are suffering. And I said, you know, you have to understand that every sport has a different

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:25.280
[Guest 2]: audience. And just because something is 10,000 crores doesn't mean 50 crore is bad. A small

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:29.920
[Guest 2]: scale company doesn't, you know, just because Reliance is a big company doesn't mean a bearings

00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:37.200
[Guest 2]: manufacturer in Pune is bad. He has his own space, Reliance has his own space, so you're saying that

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:46.400
[Guest 2]: everybody has to become a big company. There won't be any space for MSMEs. Similarly, there is a chess market, but you have to think whether you are at the top of that chess market or not.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:52.240
[Guest 2]: But unfortunately, everybody wants to become cricket and a, you know, 10 billion dollar company. And

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:56.800
[Guest 2]: there is no argument, right? If we are going to play Khokho or we are going to play Atta Patta or

00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:01.680
[Guest 2]: we are going to try to make these, you know, sports that have been there in India for a while

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:06.480
[Guest 2]: successful, why are we looking at cricket? Let's make a successful 5 crore enterprise.

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:12.000
[Guest 2]: Let's make that sport, you know, successful in that particular segment and therefore get the

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.200
[Guest 2]: economics right in that segment. But unfortunately, every conference you go to, you know, this is the

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:22.640
[Guest 2]: problem. Badminton should be the new cricket. It doesn't happen like that. Couple of thoughts on this.

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.720
[Amit Varma]: One, of course, is from the Creator Economy, where Kevin Kelly wrote that famous essay 12 years back,

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:32.960
[Amit Varma]: Thousand True Fans, where the thesis is, don't think of it anymore in terms of winner takes all,

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:38.160
[Amit Varma]: which the entertainment industry has been before that the people at the 1% will make all the money

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:43.760
[Amit Varma]: and the rest are strugglers in Versova cafes. But instead, you know, if you get 1000 true fans

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:49.040
[Amit Varma]: who are willing to pay $100 a year for your work, that's enough. And we see that on Substack with

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:55.440
[Amit Varma]: some the standard subscription model is $100 a year and you have many previously unknown

00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:01.280
[Amit Varma]: Substackers making a decent amount of money with that. That's sort of one aspect of it that you

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:08.000
[Amit Varma]: don't have to necessarily reach out to all those people. So, you know, so, on this, there's this

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.680
[Guest 1]: new podcast, which is being done by the Bombay Shaving, I hope I don't take the wrong company's

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.840
[Guest 1]: name, but you know, the Shantanu, this guy who's an entrepreneur has been doing and he's talking

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:23.120
[Guest 1]: about entrepreneurship. And one person in that podcast we interviewed said this saying that,

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:29.360
[Guest 1]: you know, a tennis player, right? The he said that 100 tennis player earns about half a million

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:34.080
[Guest 1]: dollars and the top guy earns this. And he did exactly this. He said, look at badminton,

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:38.080
[Guest 1]: where the number one player earns X and the number 100 perhaps earns nothing.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:45.280
[Guest 1]: Said, you know, the comparison, you should know the extent to which you are playing.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.120
[Guest 1]: That whole thing which you used to occasionally which you joked about saying that Mr. Gavaskar

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.120
[Guest 1]: is very upset even today about the fact that he didn't make money from cricket.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:57.680
[Guest 1]: Because the time when he was there, cricket was not a money-making sport.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.680
[Guest 1]: Now today, it's such a money-making sport. But he made the maximum money in his tennis

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.120
[Unknown]: which he forgets. Which is what I'm saying, that's what I keep saying. But Satish, that's what I'm

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:12.880
[Guest 1]: saying that do not, see because I was an anchor to a very large degree, I often had to stay in

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.160
[Guest 1]: this thing of, he has a car, he has this, he has that. I don't know what it was, I don't know whether

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:24.240
[Guest 1]: it is the Lucknow or Bringing, whatever it is, but I never compared. But I said, where have I come from?

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.240
[Guest 2]: Exactly, Roshan, the problem here is in cricket as well as in Bollywood.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:28.960
[Guest 2]: Absolutely.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.480
[Guest 2]: In cricket as well as in IPL, only 20 people are earning multimillion salaries.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.200
[Guest 2]: Correct.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:40.400
[Guest 2]: The remaining 100 players are in the small range. Similarly, even in our entertainment industry,

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.960
[Guest 2]: you take the 20 Bollywood stars out, you take the 5 or 6 TV stars out,

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:50.160
[Unknown]: rest are not going to make that much money. But the aspiration of those guys is to become Ranveer

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.200
[Guest 2]: Singh. Now, the moment you start comparing yourself with Ranveer Singh's annual income,

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:04.560
[Guest 2]: you have stopped growing. The problem is, in every field, you want everyone in that entire

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:11.360
[Guest 2]: ecosystem to become the unicorn of that field. And unless we reconcile to the fact that even the

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:17.600
[Guest 2]: smaller guys are viable, as long as you are viable, as long as you know that you can continue

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.480
[Guest 2]: building good sportsmen or good artists in that sphere, you should be happy. But then if you also

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:29.600
[Guest 2]: want 150 million likes like Cristiano Ronaldo, when you are playing probably Kabaddi in Tiruchirappalli,

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.480
[Guest 2]: then you should be worried about how your success in that state is, rather than getting followers.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.280
[Guest 1]: Of course, see what's happening with startups, right? I mean, over the last three years,

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.320
[Guest 1]: and also this thing about suddenly, I mean, everybody will join whichever new trend is

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:46.560
[Guest 1]: coming. But now startups, remember that I used to joke and say that in the late 80s,

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.400
[Guest 1]: if you didn't do anything, people would ask you, what do you do? You would say, I work in PR.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.400
[Unknown]: Then a few years later, you would turn and say, what do you do? I work in event management.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.920
[Guest 1]: Right? It continued. And last was, I work in digital. Now it was, I'm an entrepreneur.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.600
[Guest 1]: Everybody is a startup entrepreneur. And even if you lose your job, how will you get credibility?

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:10.720
[Guest 1]: I'm a startup. I'm just working on my startup. Now, my problem, and because of my thing,

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:16.560
[Guest 1]: saying investor, because I invested a bunch of startups or whatever. There's a set of emails every

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:22.800
[Guest 1]: day. And I promise you, they're a case study. Because I have seen your life, I want to become

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.680
[Guest 1]: you, blah, blah, blah, blah. I've got this idea that no one else has ever had. You know, and ideas

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:32.720
[Guest 1]: are a dime a dozen. Where's the implementation? What will you do? The true entrepreneur will be

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.800
[Guest 1]: seen right now when this funding winter is going on. Yeah, suddenly there's a big funding.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.960
[Guest 1]: Now we'll know who's actually in how much water. People, see, the rising tide carries all boats.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:48.480
[Guest 1]: But now we'll know when it's coming down, who's in how much water. Right? Suddenly,

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:52.960
[Guest 1]: those same people who are giving you that $100 million check are not even cutting you. I mean,

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:57.920
[Guest 1]: they actually say, I'm sorry, no more money. Two of my friends had to exit. I exited a company last

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:02.400
[Guest 1]: time because I thought I was getting great value. I said, no, no, this is 5x more. Called me two

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:08.720
[Guest 1]: weeks back and he said, you know, I had to take a haircut and take what you, 30% of what you took,

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:14.560
[Guest 1]: because they said, market's completely changed. So this thing now of following, chasing that

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:22.800
[Guest 1]: trend, become a TikTok star, become this, basic talent, first see who that is. I have never taken

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:33.600
[Amit Varma]: a haircut. And our second, we'll come to Conhead later. You know, you mentioned startup. So I

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:40.000
[Amit Varma]: remembered the second point I wanted to make with the thousand two fans point, which was that I did

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.920
[Amit Varma]: an episode with Vinay Singhal. Right now, Vinay Singhal is one guy who said, I won't follow the

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:52.160
[Amit Varma]: trend. He started this company called Stage. Have you heard of? Yeah. So what Stage decided

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:57.440
[Amit Varma]: was that we will be an OTT for Bharat, but not an OTT for Bharat in terms of Hindi, Punjabi,

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:04.160
[Amit Varma]: in these major languages, but for the dialects. Now, I had always thought that, you know, that

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.840
[Amit Varma]: with urbanization and the forces of capitalism and people going for scale, that there's going

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:14.880
[Amit Varma]: to be a certain homogenization, that you grow up in a Haryana village, you have a particular

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:19.920
[Amit Varma]: dialect, you go to a city, but then your incentives are to learn the languages of the city, which

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.960
[Amit Varma]: could be Hindi, if it's a north city, or it could be English, and gradually dialects die. And

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:29.360
[Amit Varma]: Vinay's narrative has a lot of this happening in the first part of his life, where he is embarrassed

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:32.880
[Amit Varma]: of his dialect, he speaks about a struggle learning English, and then he speaks about a struggle

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:38.640
[Amit Varma]: learning Hindi, you know, and so but he started an OTT for dialects like Haryanvi, Bhojpuri and

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:42.560
[Amit Varma]: Rajasthani, I think are the three that they have now. And that's worked remarkably well, they've

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:47.920
[Amit Varma]: got a lakh and a half subscribers at Netflix rates. And I see a movement towards the opposite

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:52.560
[Amit Varma]: direction now, again, fueled by capitalism, but also with the aid of technology, which is

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:58.240
[Amit Varma]: empowering individual creators, where a creator can today go out there and say, okay, I am Haryanvi,

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:03.360
[Amit Varma]: I talk like this, but I'm proud of it, I'm going to own it, you know, I'm not going to try to fit

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:08.880
[Amit Varma]: in, I don't care where the large market is, I will own it. And those markets are now taking shape,

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:14.240
[Amit Varma]: like when I spoke about this reverse migration from Bollywood, that earlier Haryanvi kids used to

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:18.880
[Amit Varma]: come to Bombay, to work in Bollywood, and today they are going back. And I find this very

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:25.760
[Amit Varma]: interesting, because what this means, to me, is a semi permanent shift away from the mainstream

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:31.520
[Amit Varma]: being everything, there will still be a mainstream, but it will no longer be everything, that people

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:37.360
[Amit Varma]: will also have their own ecosystems where, you know, but there'll be dispersed audiences, there'll

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:43.680
[Amit Varma]: be whatever, but they can form the like, I have my little ecosystems, which I as a consumer,

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:48.080
[Amit Varma]: which I keep dipping into, like including chess, for example, which you guys might not even know

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:53.520
[Amit Varma]: are there, and it doesn't matter. And they are big enough to be successful, you no longer need scale.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:58.400
[Guest 1]: And they are financially viable. Yeah. No, but are you comfortable with the niche,

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:04.080
[Guest 1]: that Haryanvi actor going back and working on the stage has to be comfortable currently with

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:08.800
[Guest 1]: the fact that it will be perhaps a 100 crore economy. Now, if he again goes back to the

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:13.760
[Guest 1]: Ranveer Singh comparison, he'll be sitting and saying, yaar, yaha ka Hussar Ranveer ban diya, lekin wahan ka kab ban diya.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:22.880
[Guest 2]: But kya hai Roshan, jab yeh organize hoega, aur iska evolution hoga, toh uska jo revenue hai, probably will be better than many Bollywood actors here.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:31.360
[Guest 2]: Possibly. Forget the top 8-10, but if I am a Haryana ka Ranveer Singh, I will make more money than a whole lot of people in mainstream Bollywood.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:36.080
[Amit Varma]: But my point is, you don't have to be Haryana ka Ranveer Singh, you can be Haryana ka whatever, Gajraj Rao.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:42.960
[Guest 2]: Absolutely. But the fact that Gajraj Rao can survive and make money in Haryanvi is a great thing.

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:48.800
[Guest 1]: And the other unique thing that will happen over a period of time is once you get comfortable with

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:53.040
[Guest 1]: telling stories in your own Basha Boli, as he said, that beautiful line, right?

01:07:53.040 --> 01:08:00.400
[Guest 1]: Ke main apni boli mein, apni dialect mein kahaani batara hu, phir aap dusri cheez karenge, aap pehle toh apni kahaaniya batayenge.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:06.560
[Guest 1]: And when the stories are deeply personal, they are absolutely universal. Yeah, right. So when a

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:12.560
[Guest 1]: parasite suddenly wins an Oscar, it's why? Because, and this is where I believe that AI etc is going to

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:18.320
[Guest 1]: say, here is a Haryanvi thing, but I'm able to dub it. I'm currently working with two startups,

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.800
[Guest 1]: where these guys are doing dubbing, which is going to sync. So first, it will take any dialect, as

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:31.680
[Guest 1]: long as the AI has got the ability to translate that, right? So from audio to text, then it'll

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:37.120
[Guest 1]: take the text, translate it into another language. It'll contextualize with a human individual to see

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:42.480
[Guest 1]: whether that is working. And then it's going to lay it back in another emotional voice. Now,

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.840
[Guest 1]: imagine what will happen to content then. Then it'll be the success of the story.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.920
[Guest 1]: And that's what I'm saying. And therefore, going deeply niche is actually going to bring about

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:58.880
[Guest 2]: something unique. And I'm hoping for that. And I think what it will also do is that if at one

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:05.760
[Guest 2]: point of time for 100 years, only aspirational cool dudes have been mainstream Bollywood actor,

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:19.760
[Guest 2]: it will slowly get cut. And suppose I'm a boy from Haryana, I'm seeing that my hero is a Haryana star. And he also has a BMW 7 series, which used to be only with Ranveer Singh.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:26.320
[Guest 2]: The moment all those parameters come in my local hero, then my need to relate to Ranveer Singh or

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:31.040
[Guest 2]: probably any Bollywood actor is much lesser, because I know that my heroes also have it.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:41.040
[Guest 2]: And therefore, I think it will kind of equalize. And that is probably the reason the South Indian stars in the past, Rajinikanth wanted to come and do mainstream Hindi films.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.040
[Guest 1]: They don't want to do it anymore.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:49.040
[Guest 2]: Now, why would they want to? They might just want to do it because they want to. We also need a North Indian audience. But now that problem has been solved.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.040
[Guest 2]: North Indian audience is now watching South Indian films.

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:59.040
[Guest 1]: The Pushpa you saw, sorry I'm just butting in, but the Pushpa you saw in Hindi, because you saw it in Hindi, was dubbed by Shreyas Talpade.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.040
[Guest 1]: And dubbed so beautifully, Dharivedi is standing and saying, boss, look at that level of dubbing.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.040
[Guest 1]: And that's what made the film. They didn't change the film.

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.040
[Guest 1]: Exactly.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:10.040
[Guest 1]: And the problem that Bollywood is doing right now, by the way, because so many of my friends tell me this.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:14.040
[Guest 1]: They say, now what happens is, boss, they make South type films. No, brother.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.040
[Guest 1]: It runs there. It's their narrative.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.040
[Guest 1]: He can tie a lungi and slide his slippers there.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.040
[Guest 2]: Exactly.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.040
[Guest 2]: If you do it in Bombay, someone will slap you.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:30.040
[Guest 2]: The thing is, sir, conventionally in India, from Punjab and North India, we look, because they had a celebratory culture.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.040
[Guest 2]: They wore nice clothes.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.040
[Guest 2]: So an aspiration was made that we have to become this.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:44.040
[Guest 2]: But now what is it that if people who look the same in every state are speaking in Haryanvi or Gujarati, then my aspiration is over.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:48.040
[Guest 2]: I don't want to do a Bollywood film because my hero is sitting here.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:51.040
[Guest 2]: And I think that will be a very, very good thing for India.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:58.040
[Guest 1]: The appetite in this city at the moment, I say, I was telling Amit about the concert market or whatever.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:03.040
[Guest 1]: Saying that there are three cities in India that make money, which is Delhi, Bombay and Ahmedabad.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.040
[Guest 1]: These are the only ones where you can make money off big concerts.

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:12.040
[Guest 1]: But today, who's stopping you from taking those 20 and 90 other cities where there is the money.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:16.040
[Guest 1]: You just need to figure out what is the model and take those shows there and make money.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.040
[Guest 1]: But no one does it.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.040
[Guest 1]: Everybody wants to make a name here.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.040
[Guest 1]: There are hundreds of places.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:24.040
[Guest 1]: And India, the opportunity that is India right now.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:30.040
[Guest 1]: Honestly, and people say this thing that okay, for everything that is wrong in the last so many years of governance or whatever.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:34.040
[Guest 1]: The growth of the small city when you think about it is mind blowing.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.040
[Guest 1]: And what have you given them?

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.040
[Guest 1]: You gave them infrastructure.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.040
[Guest 1]: You gave them IT.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.040
[Guest 1]: And now boss, the road is open.

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.040
[Guest 1]: They have the hunger.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:46.040
[Guest 1]: They have the hunger and hiring people from smaller cities.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:49.040
[Guest 1]: People say, oh, there's a Lucknow quota.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.040
[Guest 2]: This is the ultimate thing.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.040
[Guest 2]: I say, recruit people who don't know English.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:57.040
[Amit Varma]: More hunger, more desire.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.040
[Amit Varma]: There's a selection bias that they've come so far as to reach you.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.040
[Guest 2]: So they wanted that much more.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Look at sport and look at Haryana.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:08.040
[Guest 2]: I mean, today, no fast bowler from urban places will go beyond 120.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.040
[Guest 2]: Because he's not seen distance that long.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:24.040
[Amit Varma]: So I'm very, I'm very struck by what Roshan said about, you know, that tell your story in Haryanvi and all stories are universal and it will reach everywhere.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:29.040
[Amit Varma]: And I'm reminded of Ayn Rand's quote about how the smallest minority is an individual.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.040
[Amit Varma]: And I think the biggest niche is an individual.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:37.040
[Amit Varma]: If you're just true to yourself, it will reach everybody, which is a big lesson here.

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:43.040
[Amit Varma]: And also I could see Vikram's brain working overtime when you mentioned that AI, which will do the dubbing and all that.

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.040
[Amit Varma]: And what is he thinking?

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.040
[Amit Varma]: It's the age of deepfake.

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Anybody's voice can be done.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, you put an AI to work on all three of us.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.040
[Guest 2]: We don't need to physically talk and have this conversation.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.040
[Guest 2]: AI will have the conversation.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.040
[Guest 2]: AI will make Tony Gregg's voice.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.040
[Guest 1]: Yeah, correct.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:08.040
[Guest 1]: I'm telling you, Vikram is always working towards what is the highest output with the least input.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.040
[Amit Varma]: I am the king of minimal input.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.040
[Amit Varma]: That's leveraging.

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.040
[Amit Varma]: That's wise.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:15.040
[Unknown]: And I sat with him and said, Vikram, let's do this.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.040
[Guest 1]: You do it.

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.040
[Guest 1]: He said to me, he'll support me to death.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.040
[Guest 1]: But it's crazy.

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.040
[Guest 1]: My frustration.

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.040
[Guest 1]: Why would you do this?

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:28.040
[Guest 1]: Let's do it.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.040
[Unknown]: Because I can see the effort.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.040
[Guest 1]: I'm sorry, I've got it.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:42.040
[Guest 1]: When we went to celebrate his 40th, my wife said, Vikram, you can look happy.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.040
[Guest 1]: I am.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:49.040
[Unknown]: Look, sir, I don't like this surprise concept.

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.040
[Guest 2]: You had a surprise party.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.040
[Guest 2]: He had a surprise party.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:56.040
[Unknown]: Look, I say all this, but control is very important to me.

01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.040
[Unknown]: If you have given a surprise, then it is not in my control.

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.040
[Unknown]: This means I am nothing.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:06.040
[Unknown]: So you can't surprise your 50th party.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.040
[Guest 2]: I don't plan a surprise party.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.040
[Amit Varma]: For yourself.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.040
[Unknown]: It will be a surprise if you execute it.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:14.040
[Unknown]: Oh God.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:19.040
[Amit Varma]: So before we get back to your chronology, I wanted to double click on something else that you said, which was fascinating.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:27.040
[Amit Varma]: Where you said that what you need to get ahead in life is to have 5 friends, 5 business contacts, and you get by.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:34.040
[Amit Varma]: And what I was thinking about that is that one, I sort of agree with the importance of friends.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:38.040
[Amit Varma]: So I have realized late in life that one has to be intentional.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.040
[Amit Varma]: Like I've lost touch with so many people.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Same laziness.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Who's going to make the effort?

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:43.040
[Amit Varma]: I'll have to write an email.

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Why?

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:45.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, he remembers me.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:50.040
[Amit Varma]: So but now I try to make more of an effort to, you know, stay in touch with friends and all of that.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:54.040
[Amit Varma]: But I am wondering about the role of intentionality in this.

01:14:54.040 --> 01:15:01.040
[Amit Varma]: Like even in whatever little career I had, you know, I was never a person who wanted to go out networking.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:08.040
[Amit Varma]: That meet people and hand out a visiting card in the age where visiting cards existed and do all of that.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.040
[Amit Varma]: That just wasn't for me.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:12.040
[Amit Varma]: I was like, if I like talking to you, I'll talk to you.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, you know, I'm not going to make the effort.

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:18.040
[Amit Varma]: But how important is intentionality to this?

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:23.040
[Amit Varma]: Because it's one thing to say that these are the friends who help me and these are the people who help my business.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.040
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, it's one thing to come at it post-facto.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:29.040
[Amit Varma]: And it's another to say that I need to cultivate friends.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.040
[Amit Varma]: I need to stay in touch with my five friends.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.040
[Amit Varma]: I need to stay in touch with, you know, I need to make business contacts.

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.040
[Amit Varma]: Because I don't know when they will come in handy.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.040
[Amit Varma]: And that second attitude is very difficult for me.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Though in the context of friends, I'm trying to do it.

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:45.040
[Amit Varma]: In the context of business, my mind just doesn't think like that.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.040
[Amit Varma]: So, how much is that intentionality important?

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.040
[Guest 2]: So, I struggled with the same.

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.040
[Guest 2]: Because I came from a middle-class Pune family.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:59.040
[Guest 2]: And which, you know, even your skills that you have, you're not supposed to display it.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.040
[Guest 2]: Let your work speak for itself.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.040
[Guest 2]: It's not important to market yourself.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.040
[Guest 2]: This is where I come from.

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:08.040
[Guest 2]: So, even I thought that intentionally making friends with someone,

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:13.040
[Guest 2]: this means that you're taking work out of me, this is not the right lens you should go.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:16.040
[Guest 2]: And I continued with this thought for a long time.

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.040
[Guest 2]: So, whatever 4-5 friends I had, they were natural friends.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.040
[Guest 2]: It was fun to spend time with them in Vaishali.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.040
[Guest 2]: And it automatically happened that I invested in them.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.040
[Guest 2]: There was no intentionality.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.040
[Guest 2]: But then I met a very interesting guy who's a very close friend of mine.

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.040
[Guest 2]: Whose name is Sunandan Lele.

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:36.040
[Guest 2]: And he's somebody, you know, one of the most eminent cricket journalists

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.040
[Guest 2]: that has been in our part of the world.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:44.040
[Guest 2]: Most importantly, he's somebody who is what I call Jag Mitra.

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:48.040
[Guest 2]: He has close to 5000 friends across the world.

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.040
[Guest 2]: There is no cricketer who's not his best friend.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.040
[Guest 2]: And I used to go on tours.

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:56.040
[Guest 2]: I started touring since 2002-2003.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.040
[Guest 2]: Up until Tendulkar retired actively in 2013.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.040
[Guest 2]: And then 3-4 years and then I stopped touring.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:04.040
[Guest 2]: And I was like amazed by this guy.

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.040
[Unknown]: That he intentionally...

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.040
[Guest 2]: See, he loves people.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.040
[Guest 2]: So, he doesn't have to do it from life.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.040
[Guest 2]: But he told me one thing.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:17.040
[Guest 2]: He said, Vikram, when are we happy?

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:21.040
[Guest 2]: I said, when somebody acknowledges us.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.040
[Guest 2]: There is a deep engagement.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.040
[Guest 2]: Someone says something good to me.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.040
[Guest 2]: Basic things, right?

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.040
[Guest 2]: What is happiness?

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:32.040
[Guest 2]: Positive thoughts, engagement, relationships, acknowledgement, meaning of life.

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:37.040
[Guest 2]: On these 5 pillars, happiness, dopamine production is dependent.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.040
[Guest 2]: So, if you like these things,

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.040
[Guest 2]: it means others like it too.

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:45.040
[Guest 2]: So, if you are giving happiness to someone,

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:48.040
[Unknown]: then why do you have intention and guilt in it?

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.040
[Guest 2]: If randomly you have to go to Roshan and say,

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.040
[Guest 2]: Roshan, I think what you did was nice.

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.040
[Guest 2]: Even if it is false.

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:59.040
[Guest 2]: But if it makes somebody happy, this is the greatest charity you can do.

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:01.040
[Guest 2]: That's the perspective he got in me.

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:05.040
[Guest 2]: And I realized that spending time with him,

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.040
[Guest 2]: he would go out of the way.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.040
[Guest 2]: The first tour I did with him in South Africa,

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:14.040
[Guest 2]: the driver who came to pick us up at Johannesburg airport,

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:17.040
[Guest 2]: 20 years later, he is the same guy who comes and picks him up.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.040
[Guest 2]: Why?

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:24.040
[Guest 2]: Because Sunandan took a small purse for his wife from Tulsi Bagh, Pune.

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.040
[Guest 2]: What would be in it?

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:30.040
[Guest 2]: He said, human relationship is the only reason we should exist on this planet.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.040
[Guest 2]: And therefore, whether it is Tendulkar Kohli,

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:38.040
[Guest 2]: if at all Virat Kohli talks to anybody in the journalism fraternity,

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.040
[Guest 2]: it's Sunandan Lele.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:44.040
[Guest 2]: Because Sunandan Lele believes that a gift is a thought transfer

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.040
[Guest 2]: that happens from one person to another.

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:49.040
[Guest 2]: It is not that I came to you with a bottle of wine.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.040
[Guest 2]: If you haven't thought about it,

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:54.040
[Guest 2]: and you haven't brought the correct gift for it,

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.040
[Guest 2]: then your gift has no value.

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:58.040
[Guest 2]: These are the values that he taught me.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.040
[Guest 2]: What a great perspective.

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:03.040
[Guest 2]: He's saying, my job is to make people happy.

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.040
[Guest 1]: You knew me all these years, you didn't learn this from me?

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:10.040
[Guest 2]: And because you said it, now you know why.

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.040
[Amit Varma]: And everything you've told Roshan about him is false.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.040
[Guest 1]: Just to make him happy.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:23.040
[Guest 2]: So the positive things out of this is that Sunandan calls me from London once

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:27.040
[Guest 2]: and says that, Vikram, gift value is not important.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:31.040
[Guest 2]: He said, this small purse I gave to the media manager at Wimbledon,

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:35.040
[Guest 2]: I'm just watching Roger Federer live at Centre Court.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.040
[Guest 2]: So what I learned from him is that this guilt of making other people happy

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:43.040
[Guest 2]: and feel important, why am I living with this?

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.040
[Guest 2]: On the contrary, I should develop this skill,

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:49.040
[Guest 2]: whether it is helpful in business or whether it's helpful in life,

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.040
[Amit Varma]: it does not matter.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.040
[Amit Varma]: But do it for his own sake.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.040
[Guest 2]: Do it for his own sake.

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.040
[Guest 2]: Because his life is, I mean, charity.

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.040
[Guest 2]: Today we are giving millions of dollars for people's upliftment.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.040
[Guest 2]: Just be nice to them.

01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:01.040
[Guest 2]: Just do a little bit of an act which makes them happy.

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.040
[Guest 2]: And that changed my perspective.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.040
[Guest 2]: And I realized that I don't do one-tenth of what he does.

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.040
[Guest 2]: And Roshan knows that I don't keep in touch,

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:12.040
[Guest 2]: generally because again, laziness and forgetfulness and stuff like that.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:15.040
[Guest 2]: But the value of that, I understood thanks to Sunandan Lele.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:19.040
[Guest 2]: And even today, if you go to any part of the world,

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:22.040
[Guest 2]: whether it is the West Indies, whether it is Australia,

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:27.040
[Guest 2]: the only person who's the best friend of John Bradman is Sunandan Lele.

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.040
[Guest 2]: John Bradman does not associate with anybody

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.040
[Guest 2]: because of the baggage of being Donald Bradman's son.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:37.040
[Guest 2]: But every tour, he will come and meet Sunandan at Melbourne or Sydney or whatever

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:41.040
[Guest 2]: and say that, Mr. Lele, you are the man of this world.

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.040
[Guest 2]: And that I used to see and say, wow, man, wow.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.040
[Guest 2]: Even Tendulkar today would call Sunandan and say that I am doing this.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.040
[Guest 2]: Do you think this is right?

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:52.040
[Guest 2]: He has most advisors because the trust,

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.040
[Guest 2]: amount of charity work that I did with Sunandan,

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:58.040
[Guest 2]: because he said that, boss, this is your duty to help others

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:01.040
[Guest 2]: because you are one of the 0.1% of the humanity

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:05.040
[Guest 2]: who is talking about cricket and you are getting paid to joke.

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:10.040
[Guest 2]: So that when I saw and then I realized that, yes, boss, it's about relationships

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.040
[Guest 2]: and you should not be awkward.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.040
[Guest 2]: On the contrary, it should be part of your checklist on a daily basis.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:18.040
[Guest 2]: That's where that intentionality and that guilt

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:22.040
[Guest 2]: that I am selfish, all those issues got sorted.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.040
[Guest 1]: No, I don't know.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:27.040
[Guest 1]: And honestly, I genuinely believe in intentionality.

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:31.040
[Guest 1]: I think it's been the defining part of what I have been all my life

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:34.040
[Guest 1]: because these guys know that I am number one a problem solver.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:37.040
[Guest 1]: So if you give it to me, I will solve it.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.040
[Guest 1]: I must solve it.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.040
[Guest 1]: I'll try my best to solve it if I can.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.040
[Guest 1]: And I try to solve it.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:46.040
[Guest 1]: And this is my parents that I'm not doing it with my Kaploo fitting.

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.040
[Guest 1]: What will I get is not at all important.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.040
[Guest 1]: So I think that is something which has worked for me.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:55.040
[Guest 1]: I remember when I had gone to the first ThinkFest or whatever, etc.

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:59.040
[Guest 1]: After two days of great conversation or whatever, we had only met.

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.040
[Guest 1]: And I said, man, after this, there should be a DoFest.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:05.040
[Guest 1]: Because everyone thinks, talks a lot, dreams are discussed a lot.

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:07.040
[Guest 1]: Even dogs think.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:18.040
[Guest 1]: And finally implementing it, because I somehow find that this ability or just this bias to action, to do things, right?

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:23.040
[Guest 1]: I mean, to make this recording happen, to push for this conversation.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:25.040
[Guest 1]: It makes all of us richer, right?

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.040
[Guest 1]: I mean, I'm getting to know parts of society that I don't know.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.040
[Guest 1]: And I'm like, wow.

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.040
[Guest 1]: I didn't know this.

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.040
[Guest 1]: I didn't know about your chess.

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:34.040
[Guest 1]: So these are discoveries that you will make.

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:37.040
[Guest 1]: I'm sorry, I'm going back to something which I did very recently.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.040
[Guest 1]: But I'm not a professional actor.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.040
[Guest 1]: It's been a hobby.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.040
[Guest 1]: I've been more, I used to act.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:47.040
[Guest 1]: And then suddenly because I started writing and directing, in every play I used to do, I would do a little walk-on.

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:49.040
[Guest 1]: Because it was fun and people used to enjoy it.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.040
[Guest 1]: And they knew me as a face on television.

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.040
[Guest 1]: So it used to add some value.

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.040
[Guest 1]: But I genuinely wasn't acting to a thing.

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:56.040
[Guest 1]: I finished Aladdin 2018.

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:59.040
[Guest 1]: I did that also at that point because a bunch of my friends said, listen, just do it.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.040
[Guest 1]: I mean, what are you scared of?

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:04.040
[Guest 1]: And I knew that I was a little scared of dancing on stage.

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.040
[Guest 1]: Singing, I'm not scared of.

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.040
[Guest 1]: Acting, I'm not scared of.

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:11.040
[Guest 1]: But again, I was doing it for a month.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:14.040
[Guest 1]: I got tons of offers for acting after that.

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:17.040
[Guest 1]: And every time I would do a couple of auditions.

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.040
[Guest 1]: Tess Joseph is a very dear friend of mine.

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.040
[Guest 1]: Wonderful casting director.

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.040
[Guest 1]: And she somehow has this big belief in me as an actor.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:25.040
[Guest 1]: And she keeps calling me for wonderful films.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:27.040
[Guest 1]: I on two occasions even got the roles.

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.040
[Guest 1]: And then the dates didn't match.

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:32.040
[Guest 1]: When suddenly this play happened to me in September and whatever, you know.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:39.040
[Guest 1]: And out of the blue, Dilip Shankar who was casting, who I was asking for help in my film in 2011.

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:43.040
[Guest 1]: Suddenly reaches out and says, listen, I've got a reverse thing for you.

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.040
[Guest 1]: Which is will you read for Lalit.

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.040
[Guest 1]: And Lalit Verma in Monsoon Wedding.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.040
[Guest 1]: And I had remembered the film.

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.040
[Guest 1]: And I said, for me the first thing was Naseer Saab Ka Role.

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:54.040
[Guest 1]: So, you know, that thing that you say, the thick and thin desire.

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:57.040
[Guest 1]: So suddenly this thing, oh my God, I'll get to do that role.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.040
[Guest 1]: I worked my butt off.

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.040
[Guest 1]: Did the audition.

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.040
[Guest 1]: Was very scared.

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.040
[Guest 1]: For one week I was like, oh my God, but it's a song.

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.040
[Guest 1]: The one song I heard was very classical.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.040
[Guest 1]: I said, I won't be able to get a note.

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.040
[Guest 1]: I actually thought of satay at that time.

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.040
[Guest 1]: Saying, I'll sing this.

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:09.040
[Guest 1]: I don't know if I'll be able to sing it or not.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.040
[Guest 1]: You know, it's a scale or not.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.040
[Guest 1]: I said, I'll get it.

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.040
[Guest 1]: You know, three months.

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.040
[Guest 1]: We did 12 shows in Doha.

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:18.040
[Guest 1]: There was a very good audience.

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.040
[Guest 1]: Some people globally saw it.

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.040
[Guest 1]: Whatever, the play will travel internationally.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.040
[Guest 1]: It will become big.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.040
[Guest 1]: But what I learnt from the people around me.

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:28.040
[Guest 1]: You know, and not, see I could also go there.

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:29.040
[Guest 1]: Amit, every morning.

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.040
[Guest 1]: Do my lines.

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.040
[Guest 1]: Sit in a corner.

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:32.040
[Guest 1]: Have my assistant with me.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.040
[Guest 1]: Give me my cup of coffee.

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.040
[Guest 1]: Go into my room.

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.040
[Guest 1]: No.

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.040
[Guest 1]: There was this girl, Sharwari Deshpande.

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.040
[Guest 1]: Who was acting opposite me.

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:39.040
[Guest 1]: Brilliant actress.

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.040
[Guest 1]: And I just said.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.040
[Guest 1]: I said, you know, you're present in every scene.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:43.040
[Guest 1]: I'm not.

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.040
[Guest 1]: My mind is racing on a hundred things.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.040
[Guest 1]: How do you do it?

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.040
[Guest 1]: She told me.

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.040
[Guest 1]: You know, I studied this in my masters in theatre.

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.040
[Guest 1]: Why don't you do this?

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.040
[Guest 1]: I took three books.

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:54.040
[Guest 1]: Now I'm studying something on perspectives in theatre.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.040
[Guest 1]: I'm studying something on breathing.

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.040
[Guest 1]: Right.

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.040
[Guest 1]: It's giving me something.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:59.040
[Guest 1]: I have a 30 year old music director.

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.040
[Guest 1]: Who I think is a genius.

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.040
[Guest 1]: Never got flapped.

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.040
[Guest 1]: Emily Whittaker, 30 years old.

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.040
[Guest 1]: Standing there and just playing the music.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.040
[Guest 1]: And we had one song changed a day before the play.

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.040
[Guest 1]: Day before the play.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.040
[Guest 1]: Because some rights issues happened.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.040
[Guest 1]: And this girl is sitting there.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.040
[Guest 1]: Figuring out.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:15.040
[Guest 1]: With the entire orchestra in two hours.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.040
[Guest 1]: And then you sit and say.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.040
[Guest 1]: But where do you do this?

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.040
[Guest 1]: Or where does.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.040
[Guest 1]: But if one intention is to work.

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:27.040
[Guest 1]: The other intention is to invest in people.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:30.040
[Guest 1]: People don't invest in people that often.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:33.040
[Guest 1]: I feel that if you invest in people.

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.040
[Guest 1]: And Sathe knows this.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.040
[Guest 1]: I will chase him down.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.040
[Guest 1]: And follow.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.040
[Guest 1]: And he is in Pune.

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.040
[Guest 1]: And he is there.

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.040
[Guest 1]: And whatever.

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.040
[Guest 1]: And I know.

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.040
[Guest 1]: Because I understand the kind of person.

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.040
[Guest 1]: I also.

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.040
[Guest 1]: Like for example.

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.040
[Guest 1]: I realize that you.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.040
[Guest 1]: You have a small set of people.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.040
[Guest 1]: Who you like to meet.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.040
[Guest 1]: Or whatever.

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.040
[Guest 1]: But I'll be.

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.040
[Guest 1]: Looking forward to meeting the people of immemorial susceptibility.

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.040
[Guest 1]: Let's like.

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:53.040
[Guest 1]: Because investing in people.

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.040
[Guest 1]: It can't be a bigger investment in the world.

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:57.040
[Guest 1]: Which you.

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.040
[Guest 1]: I am telling you.

01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.040
[Guest 1]: Everything you are telling about Sundar Lele.

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.040
[Guest 1]: I was thinking that people.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.040
[Guest 1]: What kind of thing.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.040
[Guest 1]: And I in fact.

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.040
[Guest 1]: Sometimes.

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.040
[Guest 1]: What I was scared.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.040
[Guest 1]: I have to keep some nicknacks together.

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.040
[Guest 1]: My book's copy.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:11.040
[Guest 1]: Copy a little ego was achieved.

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.040
[Guest 1]: So I said no, let's stop it.

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.040
[Guest 1]: But just doing that paying that compliment.

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.040
[Guest 1]: The members of the purse.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.040
[Guest 1]: At our hotel reception in Doha.

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:22.440
[Guest 1]: I just went the first day, I said, why don't you come and see our play?

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.320
[Guest 1]: Oh, you're doing play?

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.320
[Guest 1]: I said, yeah.

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:28.880
[Guest 1]: Oh, I would like to come, but what about tickets and what have you said?

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.440
[Guest 1]: We said, yeah, there are always some seats.

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.440
[Guest 1]: We'll get it organized.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:35.640
[Guest 1]: So the guy came, and he waited after the play.

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:41.680
[Guest 1]: And I swear, I had tears in my eyes because when I came out, this boy, the way he hugged

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:45.240
[Guest 1]: us, everyone, oh, my God, you're all our stars.

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:49.360
[Guest 1]: Then he told his own story, told his own song.

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:55.960
[Guest 1]: Now a friend has become Doha, who used to provide me almond milk in the morning for breakfast

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.760
[Guest 2]: without asking me.

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:01.920
[Guest 2]: That reminds me that Sunandan used to always from the first tour said that Vikram, you

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:07.280
[Guest 2]: have to understand your Indian team is young boys from all over the country.

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.820
[Guest 2]: And the one thing that they miss on a tour is food.

01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:11.440
[Guest 2]: And Sunandan is a good cook.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:16.720
[Guest 2]: Do not believe I have had hundreds of times when Dhoni and Irfan and Sachin and all these

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:22.880
[Guest 2]: guys coming to our room, they're sitting on the ground, Lele is cooking veg biryani and

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.280
[Guest 2]: giving it to them.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:27.200
[Guest 2]: And Dhoni is taking the utensils and washing it.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:31.080
[Guest 2]: After that, he said, Mr. Lele, you have to make this biryani on every tour.

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.200
[Guest 2]: And it's such an important thing.

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:35.840
[Guest 2]: You're playing in South Africa two to two months, you don't get the food that you want.

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.840
[Guest 2]: They're coming from Jharkhand.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.960
[Guest 2]: They're coming from various parts of the country.

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:44.480
[Guest 2]: Sunandan is a regular cook, journalism later, he said, first feed the kids, then we'll make

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:45.480
[Guest 2]: 100.

01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:46.480
[Guest 2]: So these are small things, right?

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.480
[Guest 1]: In events.

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:49.320
[Guest 1]: And it just changed the game.

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:53.840
[Guest 1]: One of the early things and events that somebody told me, I remember, actually, you've done

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.560
[Guest 1]: a show with them also, I remember.

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.120
[Guest 1]: So with Kodak, this guy Richard Fleming used to be there.

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:03.960
[Guest 1]: And he had turned and so he used to go on when we used to go and recce a venue, he used

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:08.920
[Guest 1]: to first go and look at the bedroom, what is the bed of the room?

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:11.600
[Guest 1]: Then he would go and say, what food will you serve them?

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.840
[Guest 1]: Don't serve me a special meal.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:14.840
[Guest 1]: What's your regular meal?

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:18.400
[Guest 1]: And if he could, he would try and go without actually telling them he's coming.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.920
[Guest 1]: But he said, these are the two things that matter when you're out of your house.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.760
[Guest 1]: Ultimately, in which bed do you sleep, what do you eat?

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:29.160
[Guest 1]: He says, the event is for two hours, four hours, you can make a spectacle out of it.

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.880
[Guest 1]: 20 dancing people will come, there will be lights, there will be sound, there will be

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:32.880
[Guest 1]: motivational speaker.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:36.560
[Guest 1]: Ultimately, that guy will go to that bed to sleep.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:38.840
[Guest 1]: And that meal that he will eat.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:43.680
[Guest 1]: And I have seen that change relationships and like when Amit is there, Amit is with

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:46.960
[Guest 1]: the people till 4am because he's with them.

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:50.760
[Guest 1]: Drinking, eating, laughing, knowing their families, knowing them by first names.

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:56.360
[Guest 1]: I always say that, that investment that you can make in people and when people ask me

01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:01.680
[Guest 1]: saying how do you become a good anchor or a good whatever, I say, be interested or be

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:02.680
[Guest 1]: interesting.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:13.000
[Guest 1]: If you are interested in the other person, that's enough.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.720
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I know Sulandan a little bit.

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:20.480
[Amit Varma]: I've, you know, traveled with him when I was sort of touring and in the cricket scene.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.480
[Guest 2]: The Pakistan tour especially.

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:22.480
[Amit Varma]: The Pakistan tour especially.

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:23.960
[Amit Varma]: And I remember him as this lovely, warm person.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:24.960
[Amit Varma]: But that's who he is.

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.640
[Amit Varma]: He's a warm, gentle person.

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:31.920
[Amit Varma]: So everything that he tells you about the importance of meeting people, making them

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:34.760
[Amit Varma]: happy is, I would imagine it comes naturally to him.

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:40.240
[Amit Varma]: And it is not as if, you know, if he has put intentionality, then he has put post-facto.

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.880
[Amit Varma]: To me, it seems like that's the kind of person he is.

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:47.220
[Amit Varma]: And I'm wondering what is the feedback loop between those two?

01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:51.880
[Amit Varma]: Because if you are, for example, intentional about something and you do it all the time,

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.080
[Amit Varma]: at some point it becomes a part of you.

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.080
[Amit Varma]: Right?

01:29:55.080 --> 01:30:01.280
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, so Roshan, when you talk about, for example, investing in people, is it that

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:04.160
[Amit Varma]: you've always been a warm person who's looking out for others?

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:07.480
[Amit Varma]: Or is it that at some point you realized that this is a good thing to do?

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:08.480
[Amit Varma]: It works for me.

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.480
[Amit Varma]: It works for them.

01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.480
[Amit Varma]: It works for everyone.

01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:11.520
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to do more of this.

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:12.880
[Guest 2]: And then it becomes natural to you.

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:13.880
[Amit Varma]: Can I answer this for Roshan?

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:14.880
[Unknown]: Sure.

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:21.720
[Unknown]: I think he's going to say something like, I met him earlier and he was very rude.

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:25.520
[Guest 2]: I think Roshan is hugely structured.

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.040
[Guest 2]: So if he sees, so there are two aspects to it.

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:31.240
[Guest 2]: He's a warm person and therefore he's inclined to do this.

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:36.040
[Guest 2]: But the moment he realizes the value of it, he will routinize it.

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:42.440
[Guest 2]: Because he is an entrepreneur at heart with a creative, three organs creative, two organs

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:43.760
[Guest 2]: in other things.

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:46.040
[Guest 2]: One organ continuously looking for return on investment.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:49.040
[Guest 2]: So he's actually left, right, middle brain, sub-combination.

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:52.040
[Amit Varma]: How many organs are there?

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:55.040
[Unknown]: I'm trying to identify.

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Multi-organ.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.040
[Guest 2]: Multi-organ.

01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:04.920
[Guest 2]: So basically, every time you have to understand, and this is Roshan's plus and it's his minus,

01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:11.600
[Guest 2]: is because the moment you become an entrepreneur, and I've seen this in many YPO events that

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:17.280
[Guest 2]: I perform at, where there are millionaires and trillionaires, see your lens becomes entrepreneurial.

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:21.240
[Guest 2]: And that sometimes is good, that sometimes is bad, because you are looking at return

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.840
[Guest 2]: on investment on everything.

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:26.360
[Guest 2]: And you have to be wired like that to become a good entrepreneur.

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:31.040
[Guest 2]: So the moment the entrepreneur realizes that this is a place of value, his checklist will

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:32.200
[Guest 2]: have that.

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.200
[Guest 2]: And which is a good thing.

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.600
[Guest 2]: I'm not saying that.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:39.080
[Guest 2]: So it is now second nature to invest in people.

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:44.160
[Guest 2]: Now it starts with warmth, but anything that you want to excel in has to be routinized.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:47.560
[Guest 2]: And that's what atomic habits is all about, for that matter.

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:49.120
[Guest 2]: That is what sport teaches you.

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:52.240
[Guest 2]: It's about doing the same things again and again.

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:56.800
[Guest 2]: And that's why if you see Dhoni coming and taking strike, he will, you know, wipe his

01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:01.800
[Guest 2]: brow first, then he'll do this and that, because to come to a point of extreme concentration

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:06.120
[Guest 2]: and effectiveness, a routine is what takes you to that point.

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:09.600
[Guest 2]: So many people, you know, ask me, when you're imitating Sachin Tendulkar, why are you doing

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.600
[Guest 2]: that?

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:15.000
[Guest 2]: I have had a conversation with Sachin and said that if I don't make my cup of tea in

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.760
[Guest 2]: the morning, till the point of time I'm taking strike, everything is the same, because that

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:26.160
[Guest 2]: brings me to that state of consciousness where I'm facing somebody at 140 and trying to see

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:28.760
[Guest 2]: whether the ball is reversing or going the other way.

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:31.840
[Guest 2]: So that routine is what defines excellence.

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:37.480
[Guest 2]: And I think with Roshan, I've seen that, that when he knows that, boss, I'm going to be

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:41.400
[Guest 2]: useful in business, I'm going to be useful in personal relationships, I'll routinize

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:42.400
[Guest 2]: it.

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:44.280
[Guest 2]: And that's why it's become second nature to him.

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:49.160
[Guest 2]: With Sunandan also, I have seen that he will not go to anybody's house without taking

01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:50.440
[Guest 2]: that small thing.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:55.480
[Guest 2]: And if you've said in one of the conversations that I have that saffron biryani, that's it,

01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:56.800
[Guest 2]: it's in his database.

01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:01.560
[Guest 2]: Now, if he goes to Iran, then Amit, I've brought your saffron.

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:07.360
[Guest 2]: Now, the thing is, that's coming naturally to him now, but he realizes the significance

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:08.880
[Guest 1]: of making other people happy.

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:11.440
[Guest 1]: I'll add to that a little or whatever.

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:15.640
[Guest 1]: So this, this being warm, etc. was a very Lucknow thing.

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:20.640
[Guest 1]: My mother had this line which we used to always call her Kalyari Devi, because taking care

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:24.800
[Guest 1]: of the whole neighborhood, right, from the maid to that person, the ironing woman, the

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:25.800
[Guest 1]: sweeper.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:26.800
[Guest 1]: This is her problem.

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:32.720
[Guest 1]: Even today, my mother, now we have a, after years, we have a live-in, you know, a help

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:37.800
[Guest 1]: with a husband who drinks, he's nice at heart, but sometimes he drinks, whatever, that's

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:38.800
[Guest 1]: the thing.

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.360
[Guest 1]: But his two children, like they are my mother's project right now.

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:44.680
[Guest 1]: Covering their books and all that is their project.

01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:49.920
[Guest 1]: Now, the children said to him, they came home and they said, Nani, you come to our science

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:50.920
[Guest 1]: fair.

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:54.800
[Guest 1]: You know, my father, who doesn't step out, went with such pride.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:00.120
[Guest 1]: And I said that look at what it does, it gives them a reason to be, because we all need finally

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.120
[Guest 1]: that reason to be.

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:04.120
[Guest 1]: For me, I'll tell you, and I'm telling you, I have this with me.

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:08.440
[Guest 1]: Just to his saffron biryani story, I'll tell you, I love, I'm curious, I love discovering

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.440
[Guest 1]: things.

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.280
[Guest 1]: One day I discovered a place where, when somebody told me that the place called Love Fools that

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:18.960
[Guest 1]: does this incredible sit-down dinners in Bandra, I went there for the first time, to test it

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:22.760
[Guest 1]: myself, because I won't introduce my friend that I've tested, you know, properly there.

01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:26.280
[Guest 1]: Beautiful, lovely meal and whatever, loved it and stuff.

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:29.320
[Guest 1]: Talked to Sarita Pereira, who was the chef, asked her life story.

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.560
[Guest 1]: Now, nobody, people just appreciate the food.

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:34.160
[Guest 1]: I sat with her for half an hour and I asked her, where did you come from?

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:38.040
[Guest 1]: I was in Spain, I learnt here, I did this, da-da-da-da-da, whatever.

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.040
[Guest 1]: I went to Turkey.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:44.760
[Guest 1]: I'm going to Turkey through the market and suddenly I remember that she had mentioned

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:49.600
[Guest 1]: to me that many of the spices I used to use in my food, I can't find.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:53.720
[Guest 1]: And I just messaged her saying, Sarita, I'm in Turkey, I'm in the spices market, I was

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:57.160
[Guest 1]: thinking of you, anything I can get for you.

01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:00.480
[Guest 1]: What when I was in Doha, the message I sent, I just sent you that, nothing.

01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:04.760
[Guest 1]: I just suddenly said, Amit, are you fond of football, whatever, whatever, so it's that

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:05.760
[Guest 1]: thing.

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.960
[Guest 1]: And in that, there's no, it wasn't a matter of profit.

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:15.200
[Guest 1]: She said, I can get a pepper called Urf Biber, but I can't find it.

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.600
[Guest 1]: I went, I took a box with me, when did you get Urf Biber?

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:22.560
[Guest 1]: Love Fools is now one of the best known private dining experiences in Bombay.

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:25.000
[Guest 1]: There are days you can't get a seat or whatever.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.640
[Guest 1]: I can get anything, anytime.

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.880
[Guest 1]: But because, and but it's not just that.

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:31.040
[Guest 1]: I will continue the relationship.

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:34.520
[Guest 1]: Sarita will call me, I'm thinking of opening a speakeasy on top, we'll commune, come and

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:35.520
[Guest 1]: do something.

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:42.600
[Guest 1]: You know, this, you have to participate without this thing of, will I fit Papplu in this?

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.600
[Guest 2]: One, which is a big problem.

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:49.640
[Guest 2]: And I feel that this is not a problem, and this has to be reconciled.

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:57.680
[Guest 2]: Fitting Papplu is not a problem, because if, and I'm struggling because I haven't done

01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:04.160
[Guest 2]: 99% of the things, because in my lens, I have a lens from Pune, that it's wrong to ask someone

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:05.160
[Guest 2]: for work.

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:11.720
[Guest 2]: Now, if you are born from this lens, so then what happens is that, oh man, the whole world

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:13.720
[Guest 2]: has gone because of merchants.

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:18.720
[Guest 2]: We have to fit Papplu and bring Columbus there, otherwise why would he have to go there?

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:24.520
[Guest 2]: But we have to accept that as long as we are seeing win-win, as they say in Sapolsky's

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:29.840
[Guest 2]: book, this research shows that when two people win, the dopamine production is also high.

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:32.160
[Guest 2]: The double thank you moment.

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:33.160
[Guest 2]: Effectively.

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:40.000
[Guest 2]: So this means that somewhere we have to accept that if we make friends in trade, it's fine.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
[Guest 2]: There is nothing wrong in this.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
[Guest 2]: You are making friends, not enemies.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.640
[Guest 2]: So I think fitting Papplu has to be acceptable now in order to create.

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:53.680
[Amit Varma]: I think what Roshan means, and I really agree with that, and I think there is something

01:36:53.680 --> 01:37:00.440
[Amit Varma]: to that, is that at one level you can be instrumental and you can say that I will buy this spice

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.800
[Amit Varma]: so I can get a reservation when I want.

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:04.800
[Amit Varma]: At one level, you can think like that.

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.160
[Amit Varma]: But if you make it a part of the rules by which you live your life, a normative part

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:14.560
[Amit Varma]: of you, that whenever I can, I will give a friend what she wants.

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:19.760
[Amit Varma]: And I think that that leads to Papplu's fitting in unusual ways, which you could not have

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:20.760
[Guest 2]: imagined.

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.760
[Guest 2]: Absolutely.

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.760
[Guest 2]: But I am reconciling.

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:28.080
[Guest 2]: I want to come to a point where it's okay to say that, boss, if I give him saffron,

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.520
[Guest 2]: then he will give it to me.

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:31.520
[Guest 1]: But it is not you.

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:34.240
[Unknown]: And don't become that.

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:35.240
[Unknown]: I'll tell you one more thing.

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:36.240
[Unknown]: I'm not becoming that.

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:37.240
[Guest 2]: I will never become that.

01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:38.240
[Guest 2]: That's what I'm saying.

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.240
[Guest 2]: Don't get…

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.120
[Guest 2]: But it's okay if you do it.

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:44.320
[Guest 1]: This is your YPO, EO corruption, which I'm very worried about.

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.320
[Guest 1]: Kindly explain.

01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:46.320
[Unknown]: No, no, no.

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.320
[Unknown]: I'll tell you.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.360
[Guest 1]: See, YPO and EO events that happen in India, which is these, you have to be a hundred crore

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:54.040
[Guest 1]: plus or whatever, etc. to be part of one of these organizations.

01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:56.040
[Guest 1]: Vikram has told me a beautiful story.

01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.560
[Guest 1]: Actually, I think you should tell me about the negotiation story first.

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.600
[Guest 2]: Then I will build on that.

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:01.600
[Guest 1]: That's against.

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.080
[Unknown]: Our lens will never understand this.

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:11.080
[Guest 2]: So I was being called by these YPO, whatever that agency, and every now and then, you know,

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:17.960
[Guest 2]: Bombay YPO, they're the trillionaire economy, they're giving you an opportunity to perform

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:18.960
[Guest 2]: in front of the…

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.120
[Guest 2]: I said, boss, I am a middle class Maharashtan.

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.120
[Unknown]: I don't need opportunity.

01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:26.480
[Guest 2]: I cannot do and be happy.

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:27.720
[Guest 2]: So don't say that.

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.120
[Guest 2]: If you want a discount, I will give you the discount.

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:33.840
[Guest 2]: It's not that I don't want to do that event.

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.080
[Guest 2]: I want to.

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.960
[Guest 2]: And no corporate negotiates that much.

01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:39.800
[Guest 2]: They will tell you if they want you, they'll give you the money and blah, blah, blah.

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:42.360
[Guest 2]: But they were at it, at it, at it, at it.

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:46.480
[Guest 2]: Finally, I told the lady there, I said that I want to do this event free of cost.

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:49.440
[Guest 2]: No, no, sir, what are you, why are you saying that?

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:55.320
[Guest 2]: I want to do it free of cost only so that I can tell my grandmom that I work for the

01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:56.320
[Guest 2]: trillionaire people for free.

01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:02.080
[Guest 2]: I have done a favor to them that you will also be happy that there are so many big people

01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:05.520
[Guest 2]: and I told them that you don't have money, so I will do it for free.

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:06.520
[Amit Varma]: Buy something nice.

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:07.520
[Guest 2]: Okay, I will do it.

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:10.240
[Guest 2]: You are poor people, so I will do it for free.

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:13.280
[Guest 2]: So no, no, no, sir, what are you saying, sir, no, no, we will give you whatever.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:15.080
[Guest 2]: And the fee was agreed.

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:18.200
[Guest 2]: I did the show, Touchwood, it was super successful.

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:19.760
[Guest 2]: It was a great show.

01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:24.080
[Guest 2]: Everybody who was anybody and stuff like that came and said, what a fabulous performance,

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:25.080
[Guest 2]: blah, blah, blah.

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:30.320
[Guest 2]: I got drunk along with three or four people who were probably one lakh crore each.

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:31.320
[Guest 2]: I can't name them.

01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.320
[Guest 2]: I can, but I won't.

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.320
[Guest 1]: But they were there.

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:44.320
[Unknown]: And then one of the guys who was the organizers, I said, sir, why do you negotiate so much?

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:48.720
[Guest 2]: Like, why did you bother me so much?

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:51.480
[Guest 2]: So he said, son, should I tell you something?

01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:52.480
[Guest 2]: So I said, yes, tell me.

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:59.840
[Guest 2]: He was also drunk, victory, I didn't understand, what is victory?

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:07.640
[Guest 2]: He said, why are these people so big here, because they win, they win in every negotiation.

01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:17.360
[Guest 2]: Whether the negotiation is yours or a thousand crores, who wins, I win and it dawned to me

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:24.360
[Guest 2]: that at one level, maybe he's right in the way, but for me, who comes from an art, culture,

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:32.520
[Guest 2]: giving, charity, Gokhale, Agarkar, that kind of a background, I'm thinking, what a waste

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.520
[Guest 2]: of life.

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:38.560
[Unknown]: Who wants to win in a relationship, who wants to win in negotiating with an artist.

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:44.360
[Guest 2]: But then I realized what an, I mean, I'm not saying all entrepreneurs, and it affected

01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:45.360
[Guest 2]: me for seven days.

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:51.200
[Guest 2]: I said, he wanted to win with me, but then he explained to me, and then it explains the

01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:57.120
[Guest 2]: psychology that when you are negotiating two rupees with rickshaw wala, bhaji wale bechari

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:01.000
[Guest 2]: itna kaam kare, de dena usko 10 rupee extra, kya farag padta hai.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.520
[Guest 2]: But that gets ingrained, which is good for entrepreneurship, but when it goes into normal

01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.240
[Guest 2]: human relation, it becomes so bad.

01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:12.760
[Guest 2]: And still from that part, then you know that that answered my, that thing na, ki itna 200

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:18.040
[Guest 2]: crore tere paas tu holiday kyu nahi jata hai, it's because the psychology is not about making

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.520
[Guest 2]: money to enjoy.

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:23.240
[Guest 2]: It's about making money, because I want to show the other guy that ki main jeeta.

01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:27.880
[Guest 1]: No, no, and see, which is what I'm saying that the curse that I'm saying that he, thankfully

01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:28.880
[Guest 1]: he's not affected by it.

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.400
[Guest 1]: He thinks he is at some point, but it is the thing of, you know, to build contacts because

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.840
[Guest 2]: it will get you ex, blah, blah, blah, it's not him.

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:39.480
[Guest 1]: And I'll tell you, and this thing, no, I'll tell you, this thing about paplu fit karna,

01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:43.720
[Guest 1]: I have witnessed something, I used to do an interview based show with film stars at one

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:45.080
[Guest 1]: point in time.

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:46.640
[Guest 1]: And one day we were doing an interview.

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:52.280
[Guest 1]: And in that interview, another film star came, looked at this big vehicle, you know, Land

01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:56.080
[Guest 1]: Cruiser or whatever in those days, early, I'm talking late 90s.

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:59.800
[Guest 1]: And the other actor looked at this guy and said, yeah, I love this vehicle you've got

01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:00.800
[Guest 1]: and whatever.

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:01.800
[Guest 1]: How did you get it?

01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:02.800
[Guest 1]: He said, don't worry, I've got a great guy, he'll get it for you.

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:06.120
[Guest 1]: And when I was watching this, I said, yaar kya camaraderie hai, you know, between the

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:07.120
[Guest 1]: two actors.

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:10.520
[Guest 1]: And he said, I'm giving you this guy's number, you call him after half an hour.

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.240
[Guest 1]: The other actor went off.

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:16.440
[Guest 1]: This actor who owned the vehicle, called that guy and said, sunn, main tere ke liye so and

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:18.440
[Guest 1]: so bhej raha hoon, mera 10% rakh liye na.

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:19.440
[Guest 1]: Wow.

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:24.360
[Guest 1]: You know, mere saamne se saara veneer hat gaya, dosti, ye bandhan toh pyaar ka bandhan

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:25.360
[Guest 1]: hai.

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:26.360
[Guest 1]: And I said, okay.

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.560
[Guest 1]: But I will never do that.

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:31.160
[Guest 1]: And I cannot do that because I don't want to be remembered like that.

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:34.800
[Guest 1]: I do not want to be known that I made a percentage in this deal.

01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:38.720
[Guest 1]: I'll tell you what the beauty is, and it is very difficult for people to understand.

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:43.120
[Guest 1]: I have at least three people who give me equity in their company without me putting a rupee,

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:47.920
[Guest 1]: without me asking once because they said, we're so, humaise samajh mein nahi aata, huma

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:49.160
[Guest 1]: ko kaise payback karein?

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:53.200
[Guest 1]: Aap humko advise karte hoon, aap humko contract padhte hoon, aap humko business dete hoon,

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.560
[Guest 1]: aap karte hoon, aap kuchh maangte hi nahi hoon.

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:58.240
[Guest 1]: So, please, we're giving you this 5% in the company.

01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:02.120
[Guest 1]: 5% in a company which is going to grow and I know it'll grow into something big.

01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:03.920
[Guest 1]: And I was like, listen, I don't need this.

01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:04.920
[Guest 1]: No, no, no.

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:05.920
[Guest 1]: No, if you don't need it.

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:06.920
[Unknown]: You don't need it.

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:07.920
[Unknown]: But 2.5% for Sathegu and 2.5% for me, sir.

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:08.920
[Unknown]: But that.

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:09.920
[Unknown]: If you have a problem like this, we'll help you.

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:10.920
[Unknown]: But that.

01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:11.920
[Guest 1]: That's why I befriended you.

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:12.920
[Guest 1]: But I'm saying the same thing.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:13.920
[Guest 1]: But that is the, to me, that is the true joy.

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:14.920
[Unknown]: That is the real joy.

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:15.920
[Unknown]: And it's the same thing.

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:29.520
[Guest 1]: Now, to bring what he said, also think that, oh, you know, I look for routine and I put

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.960
[Guest 1]: it into my structure.

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:34.580
[Guest 1]: I actually, as I'm saying, I'm an anomaly in these terms.

01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:35.960
[Guest 1]: I did the musical.

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.240
[Guest 1]: I discovered that India doesn't have a musical company culture.

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:43.560
[Guest 1]: So in America, there is a company theater thing where there'll be a company and the company

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:46.640
[Guest 1]: will be paid for and they're rehearsing every day, which is why they can put up a musical

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:47.640
[Guest 1]: every year.

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:50.720
[Guest 1]: In India, we recruit what we call triple threats.

01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:52.960
[Guest 1]: Triple threats are, you can act, sing and dance.

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:55.920
[Guest 1]: So that's a triple threat as a performer, right?

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:59.720
[Guest 1]: And a triple threat performer is very rare to find.

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:03.200
[Guest 1]: In Disney in the West, how do you get all these big actors?

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.440
[Guest 1]: Because they start from summer camps.

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:07.240
[Guest 1]: Now, for me, there's a problem to solve.

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:10.000
[Guest 1]: If you want, there are eight big musicals happening in India.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.760
[Guest 1]: Believe you me, six of them are going to be disasters.

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:19.200
[Guest 1]: Because you are trying to hum Bollywood film musical, but, you know, are you training the

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.200
[Guest 1]: actors?

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.080
[Guest 1]: Are you training that base talent?

01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:25.240
[Guest 1]: You will get by because you will pre-record the songs and therefore they'll lip sync.

01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:27.240
[Guest 1]: Then it's not a true musical, right?

01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:30.920
[Guest 1]: You will do it because you got pre-recorded music and not live musicians, then it is not

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:31.920
[Guest 1]: a musical.

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:34.560
[Guest 1]: So to preserve that form, you need to develop this.

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:36.960
[Guest 1]: Now I found a creative problem to solve.

01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:40.040
[Guest 1]: How do you set up a musical theatre company?

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.320
[Guest 1]: So I went to my community, I said, guys, I think we should, we do, we do workshops and

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.320
[Guest 1]: this, this and this.

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:45.320
[Guest 1]: Why can't we do this?

01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:46.920
[Guest 1]: Now I will solve that.

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:52.720
[Guest 1]: This is saying trying to find a problem, trying to find a business solution for it and see

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:53.720
[Guest 1]: if it is implemented.

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:57.040
[Guest 1]: If it happens only once, it was a creative act of passion.

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:00.600
[Guest 1]: If it is finds repeat business, it's a business, right?

01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:03.200
[Guest 1]: If it can be repeated, that's one part.

01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:06.680
[Guest 1]: But jumping in and doing crazy things like going and doing this play or suddenly going

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:10.280
[Guest 1]: and doing a writing work, I mean, when I did the writing workshop with you, it was what?

01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:11.280
[Guest 1]: I have never done it.

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:12.960
[Guest 1]: Let's do it once and see what happens.

01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:17.840
[Guest 1]: I attended Satyanshu's lectures on filmmaking because I really thought his, and today Satyanshu

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:20.000
[Guest 1]: is a friend, we are working on something together.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.840
[Guest 1]: That was not the intention from day one.

01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:23.280
[Guest 1]: The intention was to learn.

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:26.040
[Guest 1]: The intention was to do something crazy and new.

01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:32.320
[Guest 1]: Satyanshu does the same, but he does it in a pace of doing that now comedy is happening.

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:33.320
[Guest 1]: It is happening.

01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:34.320
[Guest 1]: It is happening.

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:38.360
[Guest 1]: But it reached a point where I'm telling you, he got, I told him this when he got pissed

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:42.880
[Guest 1]: off because everybody would call him a comic, but his logic was, boss, that's a lot of intelligence

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:44.280
[Guest 1]: and really there is.

01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:47.600
[Guest 1]: Some of his observations in shows, my God, that's a life truth.

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.600
[Guest 1]: It's not comedy.

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:51.080
[Guest 1]: Zakir today with Tathastu, everybody is going nuts.

01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:55.000
[Guest 1]: Yeah, it's life truths, which is just captured in a format.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:01.720
[Guest 1]: So Satya said, no, to prove that I am much more, I must write a book also, I must do

01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:02.720
[Guest 1]: this.

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:07.560
[Guest 1]: You know, I have to tick off all the intellectual hallmarks, I have written a book, I am a motivational

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:08.560
[Guest 1]: speaker.

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:14.640
[Guest 1]: He does all of those things because he has the ability to, but he is a reticent, in 20

01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:16.960
[Guest 2]: years, in 10 years, he will do one thing.

01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:23.640
[Guest 2]: No, but that is the truth because the man who was not intellectual in his system and

01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:29.840
[Guest 2]: did not do the engineering and did not do the IIT and did not do the study abroad kind

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:30.840
[Guest 2]: of a thing.

01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:35.200
[Guest 2]: There has been, again, from the background, you know, I could have been a classical singer,

01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:37.200
[Guest 2]: I could have been a good cricketer.

01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:43.800
[Guest 2]: So in my mind, boss, I have a brain, so to satisfy my inner self, I have to become intellectual.

01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:46.000
[Guest 2]: Whether it happens or not, I don't know.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.680
[Guest 2]: That's why I never, stand up comedian, we didn't know anything about that.

01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:56.480
[Guest 2]: And coming back to the chronology, I'll come to the point where I, somebody told me stand

01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:57.480
[Guest 2]: up comedy.

01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.480
[Guest 2]: There was no stand up comedy.

01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:05.440
[Guest 2]: 2002, if you remember, Amit, at that point of 98 to 2002, there was Cyrus Brocha, because

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:10.080
[Guest 2]: we recruited the VJs at that point of time, I joined MTV by then.

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.600
[Unknown]: Shekhar Suman, who was Shekhar?

01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:15.280
[Amit Varma]: That was still later, right?

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:16.280
[Guest 2]: That was around that time.

01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:17.280
[Guest 2]: I traveled with them.

01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:21.840
[Guest 2]: So English stand up comedy was not there at that time.

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:26.240
[Guest 2]: But the one great value that MTV added, and I think that changed my life.

01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:30.520
[Guest 2]: And many people don't know, and probably Roshan would know a little bit, that I was actually

01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:35.080
[Guest 2]: a socially anxious person, I had major social anxiety.

01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:37.720
[Guest 2]: And many people think, you're a comedian, how can you be like this?

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:42.120
[Guest 2]: People don't realize that you might be a cricketer who scores in front of 80,000 people.

01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:45.960
[Guest 2]: But in a small social setup, you can be extremely anxious.

01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.640
[Guest 2]: Because you can't make personal one on one conversations and stuff like that.

01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:53.400
[Guest 2]: And it was because of certain incidents of you know, rejection that happened to you in

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.400
[Guest 2]: school college.

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:58.720
[Guest 2]: Again, I don't remember when and how, but it was there for sure.

01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:01.560
[Guest 2]: And that kind of changed in MTV.

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:08.080
[Guest 2]: Because MTV was an environment where I had left Pune, and I had come to this place where

01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:10.960
[Guest 2]: and that was the first phase of MTV, right?

01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:13.860
[Guest 2]: Everybody suddenly had become creative.

01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:17.600
[Guest 2]: Everybody was acknowledging that bad jokes are good.

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:24.360
[Guest 2]: And that bad jokes culture kind of opened my mind and said, here bad jokes are appreciated.

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:28.380
[Guest 2]: And as Woody Allen would say that there are 100 bad jokes, and there is one good joke.

01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:33.360
[Guest 2]: And that one good joke goes into the library to make a stand up comedy act six months later.

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:38.720
[Guest 2]: So it's a compilation of 100 good jokes, which come after 10,000 bad jokes.

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:44.760
[Guest 2]: But that bad joke culture in MTV kind of opened my mind and I got appreciated for doing these

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:47.080
[Guest 2]: one liners and stuff like that.

01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:52.480
[Guest 2]: Then one fine evening, a common friend Gigi George saw me imitating Sachin Tendulkar.

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:55.840
[Guest 2]: And he said, What are you doing here, you should be a VJ.

01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:58.680
[Guest 2]: And then there was a VJ hunt next week.

01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:02.460
[Guest 2]: And Brocha called me on stage and I did a five minute act.

01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:05.400
[Guest 2]: And somebody told me it was a stand up comedy.

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:07.240
[Guest 2]: And I said, What is this?

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:10.760
[Guest 2]: Because there was no Google and whatever, the only people we idolized was...

01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:12.760
[Amit Varma]: This would have been 98 if I remember.

01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:13.760
[Amit Varma]: 98.

01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:14.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:15.760
[Amit Varma]: 98, 99.

01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:16.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, must be.

01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:17.760
[Guest 2]: I remember that.

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.120
[Guest 2]: So it so happened that then I found out, you know, called for some books, Jerry Seinfeld,

01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:26.120
[Guest 2]: I think Seinfeld last season was happening at that point of time, somebody sent me some

01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:27.360
[Guest 2]: clips.

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.760
[Guest 2]: So I started watching that.

01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:35.040
[Guest 2]: And that's when I realized that there is some game in these imitations that I'm doing.

01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:38.280
[Guest 2]: And this Sachin imitation just resonated.

01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.180
[Guest 2]: And Sharjah just happened, right?

01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:46.080
[Guest 2]: So that Tony Gregg, Sachin Tendulkar imitation, which I used to do, post the 1998 Sharjah

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.360
[Guest 2]: tour, everybody started liking it.

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:54.920
[Guest 2]: And I was like, yeah, that was the seed when, you know, I realized that this can be done.

01:49:54.920 --> 01:50:00.520
[Guest 2]: But the MTV environment and all allowed me to do these experiments on stage.

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:02.400
[Guest 2]: And you know that imitation, right?

01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:04.920
[Guest 1]: Please, can we have it?

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:09.920
[Guest 2]: My theory at that time was Sharath Pawar had paid off Tony Gregg and told him the more

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:11.880
[Guest 2]: you praise Tendulkar, I'll increase your salary.

01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:14.200
[Guest 2]: It was his economic model.

01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:16.800
[Guest 2]: So Tony Gregg went completely mad.

01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:18.720
[Unknown]: Well, it's all happening here.

01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:22.440
[Unknown]: Sachin Tendulkar's on fire, smash them all over the place.

01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:28.600
[Unknown]: What applies to the airs, got it, Balancher 6, all those people are watching the telecast

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:29.600
[Unknown]: live on.

01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:35.480
[Unknown]: I'm sure Dishon will be dancing in their lounges because Tendulkar's on fire, smash your strides

01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:37.240
[Unknown]: all over the place.

01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:38.520
[Unknown]: What a play.

01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:41.920
[Guest 2]: What a wonderful, wonderful play.

01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:43.760
[Guest 2]: Cut to the presentation.

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:46.920
[Unknown]: Sachin Tendulkar, the play comfort level is of vital importance.

01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:50.760
[Unknown]: These one day matches, I think you played some quality cricket out there.

01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:55.200
[Unknown]: Yeah, I thought most definitely I thought the wicket was great.

01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:59.520
[Unknown]: At the end of the day, what matters is that we play well as a team.

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:02.120
[Unknown]: And I thought we played better cricket than them.

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:05.240
[Unknown]: In one match, he said definitely the wicket was great.

01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:07.840
[Unknown]: Second match, he said most definitely the wicket was great.

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:12.400
[Guest 2]: Third match, he said almost definitely the wicket was great.

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:17.400
[Guest 2]: And this imitation just, and there was no virality at that time, but word of mouth was

01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:18.400
[Guest 1]: there.

01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:19.880
[Guest 1]: Got to us.

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:23.640
[Guest 2]: So we were organizing.

01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:29.000
[Guest 2]: So this happened and I started getting on stage on many of the MTV shows and we used

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:34.760
[Guest 2]: to have this get together where Sunil Lullah, the MD at that point of time, saw me perform

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:40.600
[Guest 2]: on stage doing this 5-10 minute act as to imitate around 8-10 cricketers.

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:48.600
[Guest 2]: And then Ashish, my friend, said that there is a show called Diamond Merchant.

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:49.760
[Guest 2]: There was no stand-up comedy, right?

01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:51.360
[Guest 2]: So you were, what were you called?

01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:54.760
[Guest 2]: And you guys also did that for around 7-8 years.

01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:55.760
[Guest 2]: You are filler.

01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:00.440
[Unknown]: So our name for our profession was filler.

01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:01.440
[Guest 2]: So will you become a filler?

01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:02.440
[Guest 2]: I said, wherever you fill it, we will fill it.

01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:03.440
[Unknown]: We were getting paid.

01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:11.000
[Guest 2]: It was the first show, so we were not getting paid, but still we said we will pay a little.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:17.320
[Guest 2]: So I go to this Pancharatna building in South Mumbai, where the diamond, this thing is there.

01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:22.360
[Guest 2]: And I enter this Diamond Merchant is sitting, and there's three levels of security, I go

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.360
[Guest 2]: there.

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:24.360
[Guest 2]: What do you do?

01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:29.840
[Guest 2]: Filler, I said, you called me for filler, so I will fill it, what else should I say?

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:31.120
[Guest 2]: So do it.

01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:35.320
[Guest 2]: So I did this imitation, and that's when I got my first show.

01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:40.520
[Guest 2]: He said, only a week later, I realized that this was a big show of the diamond industry

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:43.280
[Guest 2]: along with the Oppenheimers of South Africa.

01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:49.120
[Guest 2]: And they were playing a cricket match, and there was Daler Mehndi, and I was a filler.

01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:54.920
[Guest 2]: That day, I realized that boss, if 200 diamond merchants are laughing for 10 to 12 minutes

01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:58.320
[Guest 2]: as a filler, there is something there.

01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:02.880
[Guest 2]: And in that MTV time, in that marketing, wherever I got this opportunity, I played Sidhu along

01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:09.320
[Guest 2]: with Cyrus Saukar in that show called MTV Fully Faltu, which did you write that show?

01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:14.760
[Guest 2]: I don't think I wrote that because I don't remember it, but my memory is a bit like yours.

01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:20.560
[Guest 2]: So I think Mrityunjay wrote that, before that, you did a couple of shows.

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:24.000
[Guest 2]: And then that's when I realized that boss, there is something here.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.280
[Guest 2]: Something is going right here.

01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:28.120
[Guest 2]: And then the big break happened.

01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:32.100
[Guest 2]: And that was the time I had left MTV and joined the movie industry.

01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:38.600
[Guest 2]: The promoters of Sony had started a company and again, see, my thing was Metallite Productions.

01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:43.120
[Guest 2]: So we were, as marketing guys, we were the first to enter the television industry.

01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:48.320
[Guest 2]: And I said, before I experiment with these shows and all, let me do Bollywood once.

01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:51.880
[Guest 2]: And that was the time promoters of Sony started a film company.

01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:56.120
[Guest 2]: And this one and a half years were great lessons in human observations.

01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:59.320
[Guest 2]: I learned about the entertainment industry and I'll share some with you.

01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:05.120
[Guest 2]: I did marketing for three films, Nagesh Kuknoor's second film after Hyderabad Blues, which was

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:07.360
[Guest 2]: called Teen Diware.

01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:13.200
[Guest 2]: There was Madhur Bhandar's second film after Chandni Bar called Satta with Raveena Tandon.

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:19.760
[Guest 2]: And there was a film called Dil Wil Pyaar Pyaar, which was Anant Mahadevan's debut film.

01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:23.880
[Guest 2]: This is when I entered the movie industry before we come to that legendary moment that

01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:28.480
[Guest 2]: I had with Roshan Abbas, which kind of propelled the standup career.

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:34.680
[Guest 2]: I spent one and a half years and I realized that this is a fascinating place just for

01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:37.720
[Guest 2]: people who like to observe other people.

01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:45.160
[Guest 2]: And here is where this, you know, small town interfacing with the established community

01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:47.880
[Guest 2]: is what I saw in real time.

01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:48.880
[Guest 2]: And it was great, right?

01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:50.560
[Guest 2]: At that point of time, there was no corporatization.

01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:53.680
[Guest 2]: I was the first marketing guy in an unorganized sector.

01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:59.360
[Guest 2]: So the old school script writers would come and, you know, show you scripts and stuff

01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:00.360
[Guest 2]: like that.

01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:03.000
[Guest 2]: And there was this funny incident that happened.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
[Guest 2]: A scriptwriter in Warsaw came and said,

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.520
[Guest 2]: You are a new guy, I will tell you such a script, sir, you will go crazy.

01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:16.040
[Guest 2]: So now, two hours and we were still at the first shot.

01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:19.920
[Guest 2]: The man comes in, so what's next?

01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:22.560
[Guest 2]: The camera grabs the man.

01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:23.960
[Guest 2]: This went for one hour.

01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:26.360
[Guest 2]: We were still in the first scene.

01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:29.160
[Guest 2]: Then I said, sir, I have to go out a little.

01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:31.400
[Guest 2]: She won't understand people like you.

01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:33.960
[Guest 2]: So I said, what do I do now?

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:34.960
[Guest 2]: You come later.

01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:41.960
[Guest 2]: Sir, let me tell you one thing, once you get this picture, you'll have to take it off.

01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:47.960
[Unknown]: I was like, what a life!

01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:50.960
[Unknown]: But this is full.

01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:53.960
[Unknown]: Oh man, I said, what a world this is.

01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:54.960
[Guest 2]: Unbelievable.

01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:56.960
[Unknown]: Was it ever made?

01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:59.960
[Guest 2]: I don't know, it was never made.

01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:02.960
[Guest 2]: So here I have two observations.

01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:06.960
[Guest 2]: I got to learn very closely watching a lot of actors.

01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:09.960
[Guest 2]: And I am sure Roshan relates to these observations.

01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:16.960
[Guest 2]: Because I realized that there is an amazing thing that is happening between the established community.

01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:21.960
[Guest 2]: Which is people who don't consider this as a big thing because they are born in families.

01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:26.960
[Guest 2]: Who have all the resources and they have set the benchmark of coolness.

01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:29.960
[Guest 2]: They will talk Americanism, this is the kind of cinema we watch.

01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:33.960
[Guest 2]: Yes, Bollywood wants to make the same movies but they will do all of this.

01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:38.960
[Guest 2]: Now this is a benchmark that is set and this is the value of cool that has been attached.

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:45.960
[Guest 2]: Now the small time actors from smaller cities come and interact with them.

01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:48.960
[Guest 2]: With a lot of social anxiety.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:54.960
[Guest 2]: And they realize that their work or their abilities is not what is going to be judged.

01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:58.960
[Guest 2]: How they behave in this milieu is what they are going to be judged on.

01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:02.960
[Guest 2]: And this is where I see a lot of this sad thing happening.

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:07.960
[Guest 2]: Where a Marathi actor has come from say Satara, who is a good actor.

01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:13.960
[Guest 2]: Comes and goes into a party where those standard Juhu boys and girls are behaving in a certain way.

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:20.960
[Guest 2]: And the entire next three years this guy is practicing to be that person.

01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:24.960
[Guest 2]: So that he feels that they will now accept him and give him that first role.

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:29.960
[Guest 2]: And that one and a half two years is so traumatic because I am seeing the Marathi.

01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:33.960
[Guest 2]: Because I am now a guy who is MBA educated, can speak English and I am this.

01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:36.960
[Guest 2]: So that my social acceptability is reasonable here.

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:40.960
[Guest 2]: And because I can speak good Marathi, my acceptability with this guy is also good.

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:47.960
[Guest 2]: And I see this guy from somebody who is discussing Pula Deshpande, Gadhi Madgulkar, Kumar Gandharva.

01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:50.960
[Guest 2]: To suddenly meeting me in a party one year later.

01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:52.960
[Guest 2]: Hey babes, what's up dude?

01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:55.960
[Unknown]: And I am like, what has happened to this person?

01:57:55.960 --> 01:58:00.960
[Guest 2]: And then I realized that this man is finished from inside.

01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:06.960
[Guest 2]: Because his entire focus has gone that how can this director who lives in Juhu accept me?

01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:09.960
[Guest 2]: And he goes inside that party, those people are making fun of him.

01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:18.960
[Guest 2]: And then I realized that if there was an organization which just makes these two ends meet properly, talent will be discovered.

01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:25.960
[Guest 2]: But trust me, nine out of ten talents that I met during that time was struggling to just fit in.

01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:29.960
[Guest 2]: Because they wanted to say dude and babes, rather than practice their craft.

01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:35.960
[Guest 2]: And unfortunately, that is the part I saw and I realized that this the Haryana factor that you are talking about.

01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:40.960
[Guest 2]: That time 20 years back I thought that I wish there were stars in their own domain.

01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:42.960
[Guest 2]: And they didn't have to suffer this.

01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:45.960
[Guest 2]: That was one thing I learned which I saw very closely.

01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:50.960
[Guest 2]: The second thing was the dynamics of actors coming late.

01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:53.960
[Guest 2]: Or behaving in a particular manner.

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:57.960
[Unknown]: And I used to say that dude, what is the problem of coming on time?

01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.960
[Guest 2]: And then there was this celebration culture.

01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:04.960
[Guest 2]: That sir, this actor comes at least 6 hours late.

01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:06.960
[Guest 2]: And he is a big actor.

01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:08.960
[Guest 2]: And this was getting celebrated.

01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:12.960
[Guest 2]: And I said, what is this psychology of people celebrating bad behavior?

01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:16.960
[Guest 2]: And then one actress, she started to behave very badly on the set.

01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:21.960
[Guest 2]: So I went to her and I said that ma'am, I mean, everybody is normal.

01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:23.960
[Guest 2]: If you have any issues, just let me know. I'll sort it out.

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:25.960
[Guest 2]: And I was trying to be structured.

01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:28.960
[Guest 2]: Because that's the only thing I knew coming from a corporate background.

01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:31.960
[Guest 2]: And if you were structured, you were considered uncool.

01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:33.960
[Guest 2]: But I told her that this is what.

01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:36.960
[Guest 2]: And one day she got drunk and she called me to the set.

01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:39.960
[Guest 2]: And then we went to the vanity van and she told me that.

01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:41.960
[Guest 2]: Dude, come here.

01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:44.960
[Guest 2]: Let me explain to you what industry is.

01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:47.960
[Guest 2]: And I said, yes, ma'am, explain.

01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:49.960
[Guest 2]: Did you find anything lacking on the set?

01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:54.960
[Guest 2]: She said, if I behave well, you all will take me for granted.

01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:59.960
[Guest 2]: So I make sure that every day of my film, first day, I break a glass.

01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:02.960
[Guest 2]: I do something so that I start getting respect.

02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:06.960
[Guest 2]: If I don't do that, even the spot boy won't give me tea.

02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:11.960
[Guest 2]: When I do the first day, then I will get respect in the industry.

02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:15.960
[Guest 2]: And I was like, what kind of behavior is this?

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:19.960
[Guest 2]: But then I realized that all this creative ecosystem here.

02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:22.960
[Guest 2]: Was about getting attention to yourself.

02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:25.960
[Guest 2]: And therefore it was important to behave badly.

02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:27.960
[Guest 2]: And that became culture.

02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:31.960
[Guest 2]: So if an actor came on time, he was considered an idiot.

02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:33.960
[Guest 2]: So he came three hours late.

02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:35.960
[Guest 2]: So that there was this danger and stuff like that.

02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:38.960
[Guest 2]: And this human behavior was great to watch.

02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:42.960
[Guest 2]: Because this was exactly what is the opposite of what is taught to you in management school.

02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:45.960
[Guest 2]: That systems and data and all of that.

02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:50.960
[Guest 2]: And then I realized the creative industry is about interplay of all these emotions put together.

02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:54.960
[Guest 2]: And to give structure to this emotional ecosystem.

02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:57.960
[Guest 2]: Is going to be the biggest challenge for the future.

02:00:57.960 --> 02:00:59.960
[Guest 2]: And that point of time there was no corporatization.

02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:03.960
[Guest 2]: So these were observations that kind of made me interested in this.

02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:05.960
[Guest 2]: And say like how do people behave.

02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:08.960
[Guest 2]: And that point of time the magic moment happened.

02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:11.960
[Guest 2]: When I got a call from Mr. Roshan Abbas.

02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:14.960
[Guest 2]: And said that, he didn't know me at that time.

02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:17.960
[Guest 2]: He said, I have heard that you do filler-biller.

02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:21.960
[Guest 2]: So can you do it for 12-15 minutes?

02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:23.960
[Guest 2]: So I said yes, I can do stuff like that.

02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:25.960
[Guest 1]: And this is for the Seat Cricket Awards.

02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:27.960
[Guest 1]: This is for the Seat Cricket Awards, which is the biggest property.

02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:30.960
[Guest 2]: And this is the property I had worked in professional management through.

02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:34.960
[Guest 2]: Where you know how the rating systems is created for cricketers and stuff like that.

02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.960
[Guest 2]: Now there were, Roshan said, there is no English stand-up.

02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:40.960
[Guest 2]: He doesn't know what I do.

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:43.960
[Guest 2]: So he says, you come to my house.

02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:44.960
[Guest 2]: Okay.

02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:48.960
[Guest 2]: Whatever you are going to do, you have to do it in front of me.

02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:49.960
[Guest 2]: I had no benchmark.

02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:51.960
[Guest 2]: I said okay, I will dance at his house.

02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:53.960
[Guest 2]: What's the big deal in this?

02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:57.960
[Guest 2]: At the same time, he said that after doing it in my house,

02:01:57.960 --> 02:02:01.960
[Guest 2]: Harsh Goenka, who is the chairman of Seat, his people will also call you.

02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:02.960
[Guest 2]: You have to go there too.

02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:07.960
[Guest 2]: So imagine a time where the stand-up comedian first goes to the event agency.

02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:11.960
[Guest 2]: Roshan Abbas is sitting there with his friend and says, do it.

02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:13.960
[Unknown]: Very sure.

02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:15.960
[Guest 2]: Very sure.

02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:17.960
[Guest 2]: Like, dance.

02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:19.960
[Guest 2]: And I did the act.

02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:21.960
[Guest 2]: Roshan has no idea about cricket.

02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:25.960
[Guest 2]: But Roshan knows that it is working.

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:28.960
[Guest 2]: So he says that I think this is fine.

02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:29.960
[Guest 2]: Whatever he is doing.

02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:32.960
[Guest 2]: But obviously, because imitations and all is something that he would know.

02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:35.960
[Guest 2]: He said that tomorrow you have to go to Mr. Harsh Goenka.

02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:39.960
[Guest 2]: Now Mr. Harsh Goenka with six people are sitting in a boardroom.

02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:45.960
[Guest 2]: And I suddenly feel I am in MBA entrance exam going for my first job.

02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:48.960
[Guest 2]: And they say that, because nobody knows, right?

02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:51.960
[Guest 2]: What is a stand-up English comedian going to do?

02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:54.960
[Guest 2]: Because what is the line-up for the Seat Awards?

02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:57.960
[Guest 2]: Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Urmila Matondkar, Mahima Chaudhary.

02:02:57.960 --> 02:02:59.960
[Amit Varma]: And to put an item in between.

02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:01.960
[Guest 1]: This is 2001, I am guessing.

02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:02.960
[Guest 1]: Three.

02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:03.960
[Guest 1]: Three.

02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:07.960
[Guest 1]: And our line-up was Priyanka Chopra doing her first event.

02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:09.960
[Unknown]: First event.

02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:13.960
[Guest 1]: There was Gauhar, there was Mandira, there was Priyanka, there was Ramona.

02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:15.960
[Unknown]: I forget the main actor.

02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:16.960
[Guest 1]: No, no, there was Akshay Kumar.

02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:18.960
[Guest 1]: Urmila Matondkar was there.

02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:19.960
[Guest 1]: But it was a big line-up.

02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:20.960
[Guest 2]: Big line-up.

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:23.960
[Guest 2]: So I go there, I do my 10 minutes.

02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:26.960
[Guest 2]: I am still working in MetLight.

02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:29.960
[Guest 2]: So I remember the day when this happened.

02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:32.960
[Guest 2]: My boss was not letting me go fast.

02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:34.960
[Guest 2]: So I said no, I have to go to perform at the Seat Awards.

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:36.960
[Guest 2]: So finally he left me.

02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:40.960
[Guest 2]: I came to Taj Crystal where the Seat Awards were there.

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:42.960
[Guest 2]: And I was so badly dressed.

02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:44.960
[Guest 2]: Because I was in like corporate apna trouser.

02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:47.960
[Guest 2]: And there only I realized everybody is in jacket.

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:51.960
[Guest 2]: That was my first exposure to the fact that this stand-up comedian is like this.

02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:54.960
[Guest 2]: I just wore my Jeffrey Boycott cap there.

02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:58.960
[Guest 2]: But thankfully Roshan said that we need a little bit of design in your act.

02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:01.960
[Guest 2]: Since then they were thinking.

02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:07.960
[Guest 2]: So he got me a bar where I could hang my caps.

02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:10.960
[Guest 2]: So that every time I do an impersonation, I wear that.

02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:11.960
[Unknown]: Change the cap.

02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:12.960
[Guest 2]: Wow.

02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:14.960
[Guest 2]: And I met Ian Chappell there.

02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:20.960
[Guest 2]: And that was my, you know, all these years of cricket.

02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:23.960
[Guest 2]: I was very happy to meet Ian Chappell there.

02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:25.960
[Guest 2]: And he said, you know, so I got myself introduced.

02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:27.960
[Guest 2]: I said I am doing this act and stuff like that.

02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:32.960
[Guest 2]: And I reached there and I found out that the India and the Australian team are going to be in the audience.

02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:33.960
[Guest 2]: Which I was not told.

02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:35.960
[Guest 2]: I thought there would be ex-cricketers and stuff like that.

02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:38.960
[Guest 2]: But these two and the God himself.

02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:44.960
[Guest 2]: I mean people who we have idolized got exasperated bowling to him and so on and so forth.

02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:45.960
[Guest 2]: And they are all sitting there.

02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:49.960
[Guest 2]: And I am Jamureh Natch.

02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:53.960
[Guest 2]: That 15 minutes changed my life.

02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:59.960
[Guest 2]: Because when you see a Sunil Gavaskar, Bishan Bedi and Ricky Ponting laughing.

02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:03.960
[Guest 2]: And you've been propelled into a world which was actually your world, right?

02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:07.960
[Guest 2]: This is all the precursor to that world that you wanted to be part of.

02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:11.960
[Guest 2]: Not only as a player but as somebody who loved the game so much.

02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:15.960
[Guest 2]: And that 15 minutes and imitation of Gavaskar's walk.

02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:16.960
[Guest 2]: And I came down.

02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:18.960
[Guest 2]: Bishan Singh Bedi hugged me.

02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:24.960
[Guest 2]: And Chappelli came and told me that, you know, next time in your act I should be there and stuff like that.

02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:26.960
[Guest 2]: I said, boss.

02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:29.960
[Guest 2]: This is what I was born for.

02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:31.960
[Guest 2]: This is my domain.

02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:38.960
[Guest 2]: I didn't interact with Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan.

02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:41.960
[Guest 2]: But for me I was a failed sports person.

02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:43.960
[Guest 2]: So I had to live the dream in another way.

02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:47.960
[Guest 2]: And that kind of got me thinking.

02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:50.960
[Guest 2]: And I think another one month I gave my resignation.

02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:55.960
[Guest 2]: But the beauty of that, no YouTube generation, no Google.

02:05:55.960 --> 02:05:57.960
[Guest 2]: That actually clip went viral.

02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:01.960
[Guest 2]: Because they showed that show some 50 times on Sony.

02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:04.960
[Guest 2]: And because of that I started getting calls.

02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:08.960
[Guest 2]: Roshan got me a show with Castrol if I am not wrong.

02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:11.960
[Guest 2]: Sahara Golf and Castrol became your regular.

02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:13.960
[Guest 2]: We were very big in corporate.

02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:15.960
[Guest 1]: That was a little later.

02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:16.960
[Guest 1]: But it just kept rolling.

02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:23.960
[Guest 1]: I remember every 6 months Sathe's rates used to double because he would have done so many shows that his marketing bite would work.

02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:27.960
[Guest 1]: He knows that agencies have their own little layer.

02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:29.960
[Unknown]: There is so much demand.

02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:31.960
[Guest 2]: Boom, boom, boom, boom.

02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:33.960
[Guest 2]: At that time I was in 10-12 minutes.

02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:35.960
[Guest 2]: I had to take this for 40 minutes.

02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:38.960
[Guest 2]: And now I only had cricket stuff.

02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:41.960
[Guest 2]: By this time I had increased my reading.

02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:44.960
[Guest 2]: I had started writing on observations.

02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:46.960
[Guest 2]: Whether those were the standard observations.

02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:49.960
[Guest 2]: I had started following what is the concept of the American.

02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:55.960
[Guest 2]: I believe that no comedian ever in the history of mankind can touch him.

02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:58.960
[Guest 2]: Because there was no standard thing of premise and punchline.

02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:00.960
[Guest 2]: This is a very bore concept.

02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:01.960
[Guest 2]: Premise and punchline.

02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:05.960
[Guest 2]: It is basically very populist way of getting a laughter.

02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:11.960
[Guest 2]: Pula Deshpande would talk 2 hours on walking in Vele Parle and he would make you laugh.

02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:14.960
[Guest 2]: It was that quality of humor.

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:17.960
[Guest 2]: But then I realized that this is literary humor.

02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:24.960
[Guest 2]: Your understanding of life and society should be so high that you pick so many nuances.

02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:29.960
[Guest 2]: So then I followed the quintessential American model of that build the story and then the punchline.

02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:31.960
[Guest 2]: Build story, get punchline.

02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:33.960
[Guest 2]: I started doing that in cricket as well.

02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:36.960
[Guest 2]: And while I was doing this writing and stuff like that.

02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:40.960
[Guest 2]: I realized that my corporate job was now coming to an end.

02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:45.960
[Guest 2]: Though I have started enjoying putting a movie project together and seeing it till the end.

02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:49.960
[Guest 2]: I said that this looks like a far better in my zone.

02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:51.960
[Guest 2]: And then I quit my job.

02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:56.960
[Guest 2]: And just before quitting my job I got a call from the Sony network.

02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:59.960
[Guest 2]: This was 2003 World Cup.

02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:02.960
[Guest 2]: So my last film was still to release.

02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:08.960
[Guest 2]: And one of the shows that I had performed in MTV, the Sony chairman was there and Kapil Dev was also there.

02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:15.960
[Guest 2]: And these two guys had said that we are launching this kid with extra innings.

02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:22.960
[Guest 2]: I always joke in my initial years that nobody noticed me on extra innings because of Mandira Bedi.

02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:27.960
[Guest 2]: Even Bishan Singh Bedi didn't get noticed for years after taking 266 wickets.

02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:30.960
[Guest 2]: But to me that extra innings moment changed my life.

02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:35.960
[Guest 2]: I went to South Africa for the Cricket World Cup 2003.

02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:37.960
[Guest 2]: We stayed in Cape Town for two months.

02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:42.960
[Guest 2]: I witnessed the Centurion, Big Game, India, Pakistan as a cricket presenter.

02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:46.960
[Guest 2]: And the first day, Amit, I land in Cape Town.

02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:48.960
[Guest 2]: I don't know what I'm going to do, right?

02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:51.960
[Guest 2]: I've been told extra innings, you have to be a filler.

02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:54.960
[Guest 2]: And you have to fill in between the broadcast.

02:08:54.960 --> 02:09:03.960
[Guest 2]: And as soon as I land, this studio head takes me to a room where I enter and I see the mighty Tony Gregg.

02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:08.960
[Guest 2]: Six feet, seven inches, and I'm like, wow, this is something.

02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:12.960
[Guest 2]: And it's South Africa 2003, India touted to win the World Cup.

02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:17.960
[Guest 2]: The big team, Tendulkar, John Wright saying that, you know, this is the team that will win the World Cup.

02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:22.960
[Guest 2]: And I'm sitting there and saying that, boss, I don't know about comedy.

02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:25.960
[Guest 2]: But what has got me into cricket is these impersonations.

02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:33.960
[Guest 2]: So I have to continue stand-up comedy in the way it is, because that is going to get me to this world, which I've always wanted to be part of.

02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:37.960
[Guest 2]: So when, you know, sometimes journalists ask me, what does comedy mean?

02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:39.960
[Guest 2]: I'm like, man, this happened.

02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:40.960
[Guest 2]: I had to go here.

02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:43.960
[Guest 2]: Then it continued because it had a financial model.

02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:44.960
[Guest 2]: I continued.

02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:48.960
[Guest 2]: And then a few amazing things happened.

02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:51.960
[Guest 2]: Tony Gregg called me and said, hi, how are you doing?

02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:52.960
[Guest 2]: Good, Tony Gregg.

02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:57.960
[Guest 2]: And I imitated him and my first episode was with Tony Gregg himself.

02:09:57.960 --> 02:09:58.960
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:00.960
[Amit Varma]: Is it online somewhere?

02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:01.960
[Amit Varma]: I think it's online.

02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:07.960
[Guest 2]: And we were talking about Inzamam Ullah, who was in prime form during the World Cup.

02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:10.960
[Guest 2]: Please, please.

02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:16.960
[Guest 2]: So Inzamam, at that time, I always say that whatever may be the question, you had the same answer.

02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:17.960
[Guest 2]: It was like Azruddin, right?

02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:22.960
[Guest 2]: So Shastri would go, Azruddin, it's a great wicket out here.

02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:24.960
[Guest 2]: What did you, what was your strategy?

02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:25.960
[Guest 2]: Yeah, the boss played well, right?

02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:26.960
[Guest 2]: That's not important.

02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:28.960
[Guest 2]: But do you think the Duckworth Lewis will cover?

02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:29.960
[Guest 2]: Yeah, the boss played well, right?

02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:31.960
[Guest 2]: That's not important.

02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:34.960
[Guest 2]: But Azhar Sehwag at five, right?

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:37.960
[Guest 2]: Will you do whatever same?

02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:39.960
[Guest 2]: And Inzamam was exactly the same.

02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:43.960
[Guest 2]: Inzi, Razak is your key bowler.

02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:47.960
[Guest 2]: Thank God, the boys are working hard.

02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:49.960
[Guest 2]: The boys didn't get disheartened.

02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:52.960
[Guest 2]: But Inzamam Afridi is your key weapon.

02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:54.960
[Guest 2]: The boys are working hard.

02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:56.960
[Guest 2]: The boys didn't get disheartened.

02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:00.960
[Guest 2]: But if you can get Tendulkar out, the boys are working hard.

02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:02.960
[Unknown]: So he would not end.

02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:08.960
[Guest 2]: And we did an India Park review with Tony Gregg, where I am Inzamam and he is Tony Gregg.

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:10.960
[Amit Varma]: This is a dream come true.

02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:13.960
[Unknown]: Is Tony Gregg's imitation of Tony Gregg as good as yours?

02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:18.960
[Guest 2]: That was his first reaction as well.

02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:19.960
[Guest 2]: That it was great.

02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:22.960
[Guest 2]: And then look at the thing, right?

02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:24.960
[Guest 2]: Next episode I'm doing with Ian Chappell.

02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:27.960
[Guest 2]: After that, I'm doing an episode with Michael Arthurton.

02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:30.960
[Guest 2]: Then I'm doing an episode with Nasir Hussain.

02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:33.960
[Guest 2]: Then I'm doing an episode with Tiger Pattodi.

02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:35.960
[Guest 2]: Then I'm doing an episode with Kapil Dev.

02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:37.960
[Guest 2]: This is like a dream come true.

02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:39.960
[Guest 2]: And I'm discussing cricket with them.

02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:40.960
[Guest 1]: Being paid for it.

02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:41.960
[Guest 2]: Paid for it.

02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:44.960
[Unknown]: More importantly, I'm not paid too much for that at that point of time.

02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:48.960
[Guest 2]: But what worked for me was my knowledge of the game.

02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:51.960
[Guest 2]: And that kind of, I could befriend anybody.

02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:55.960
[Guest 2]: And I remember having a conversation with Soha Ali Khan years later.

02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:59.960
[Guest 2]: And I told her that Tiger Pattodi had become a good friend of mine.

02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:00.960
[Guest 2]: And she said, impossible.

02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:02.960
[Guest 2]: My dad was a very private person.

02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:03.960
[Guest 2]: He would not befriend anybody.

02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:08.960
[Guest 2]: And I said, I'm really telling you, I spent the best two months of my life chatting cricket with him.

02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:11.960
[Guest 2]: And she said, no, impossible.

02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:12.960
[Guest 2]: He will not talk to you.

02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:14.960
[Guest 2]: I said, I'll tell you the story.

02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:20.960
[Guest 2]: Second day, I'm there and Tiger Pattodi calls me and says that,

02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:23.960
[Guest 2]: after I'd done an imitation of Jeffrey Boycott, he said, can you do that again?

02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:28.960
[Guest 2]: And I said, I'll tell you Tiger Pattodi, absolute legend of the game.

02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:30.960
[Guest 2]: And he started laughing.

02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:33.960
[Guest 2]: And from that day onwards, I became his best friend.

02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:41.960
[Guest 2]: That same evening, Vikram Sathe, Tiger Pattodi, Kapil Dev having a glass of wine, discussing Tiger's career.

02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:43.960
[Guest 2]: Can it be bigger than this for me?

02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:47.960
[Guest 2]: Who has not even been close to the world of cricket so far.

02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:53.960
[Guest 2]: And now, and joined by Ian Chappell and they're talking about those times and the Ashes and the Kerry Packer.

02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:57.960
[Guest 2]: And I was like, boss, pinch me because this is like big stuff.

02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:03.960
[Guest 2]: And that when I came back after the Centurion game, I said, that's it, brother.

02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:05.960
[Guest 2]: This is what you want to do in your life.

02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:09.960
[Guest 2]: Till the time you can extend and do what you can around this world.

02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:11.960
[Guest 2]: I think that will be life.

02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:13.960
[Guest 2]: And that I came back.

02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:14.960
[Guest 2]: I gave my resignation.

02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:17.960
[Guest 2]: Thankfully, I was called by the Sri Lanka Cricket Board.

02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:18.960
[Guest 2]: Oh, very funny story.

02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:21.960
[Guest 2]: 2004 Sri Lanka Cricket Board.

02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:28.960
[Guest 2]: I get called to do a stand up in the India versus, sorry, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:30.960
[Guest 2]: For playing that Asia Cup.

02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:36.960
[Guest 2]: I was told that except for president, I think Kumar Tunga was the president of Sri Lanka at that time.

02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:39.960
[Guest 2]: I said, apart from that, you can imitate anybody in Sri Lanka.

02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:42.960
[Guest 2]: And otherwise, we'll throw you back from the airport.

02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:44.960
[Guest 2]: So I went for the Asia Cup.

02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:46.960
[Guest 2]: I think 2004, 2005.

02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:47.960
[Guest 2]: I don't remember.

02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:51.960
[Guest 2]: And that's the first time I got friendly with Tendulkar.

02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:55.960
[Guest 2]: And I called Sameer Dighe and told him that, you know, I'm doing this act in Sri Lanka.

02:13:55.960 --> 02:13:56.960
[Guest 2]: Just tell Sachin.

02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:58.960
[Guest 2]: He said, don't need to tell Sachin anything.

02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:01.960
[Guest 2]: You go and chat with him before the show and tell him that you know me.

02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:02.960
[Guest 2]: Blah, blah.

02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:05.960
[Guest 2]: He's anyway seen you at the Seattle Awards a little bit.

02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:07.960
[Guest 2]: He'll be fine.

02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:13.960
[Guest 2]: I land there and I go to Sachin at the show and say, Sachin, I'm going to imitate a little bit.

02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:14.960
[Guest 2]: He said, what are you going to do?

02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:16.960
[Guest 2]: I've seen you for five minutes.

02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:17.960
[Guest 2]: That's okay.

02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:18.960
[Guest 2]: No problem.

02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:22.960
[Guest 2]: And I do a 20-minute act there, 20-25 minutes.

02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:28.960
[Guest 2]: I mean, to see the Indian team, Pakistani team, Bangladeshi team, Sri Lankan team, sorry,

02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:30.960
[Guest 2]: enjoying and stuff like that.

02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:32.960
[Guest 2]: I said, boss, it's just getting reinforced.

02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:34.960
[Guest 2]: And then I am walking outside.

02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:37.960
[Guest 2]: I did the Imsamam imitation in front of Imsamam.

02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:44.960
[Guest 2]: So I remember walking out of the banquet area and suddenly I bump into Imsamam.

02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:48.960
[Guest 2]: And I think it was Yasir Hameed, if I'm not mistaken, the opening batsman of Pakistan.

02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:51.960
[Guest 2]: And Imsamam comes and looks at me.

02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:54.960
[Guest 2]: It's fun to take off your pants in front of everyone.

02:14:54.960 --> 02:15:00.960
[Guest 2]: And I said, what an evening.

02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:03.960
[Guest 2]: And next day I was to fly back to India.

02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:09.960
[Guest 2]: I was at the breakfast table and Sachin Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh were sitting out there.

02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:14.960
[Guest 2]: And that was my first taste of a cricket story, you know,

02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:18.960
[Guest 2]: and that's what I realized that this is what I want to experience all my life.

02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:20.960
[Guest 2]: This comedy and all is okay, that will continue.

02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:24.960
[Guest 2]: And about the Sri Lanka wicket or something like that,

02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:30.960
[Guest 2]: I had this conversation and Sachin gave a five to eight minute explanation on how to play Murali Tharan.

02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:31.960
[Guest 2]: Wow.

02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:32.960
[Guest 2]: On that table.

02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:36.960
[Guest 2]: So I was asking him that, you know, how do you pick it and stuff like that.

02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:40.960
[Guest 2]: So the moment he realized that this was a relevant question.

02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:45.960
[Guest 2]: So I remember Yuvraj Singh saying, this is a cricket story, he will cook it.

02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:46.960
[Guest 2]: He said that.

02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:48.960
[Guest 2]: But he said something, something.

02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:51.960
[Guest 2]: And then Sachin said that, you know, you pick him from the arm, you'll be able to.

02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:57.960
[Guest 2]: And I realized that there was some chemistry brewing between somebody who you idolized

02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:01.960
[Guest 2]: and kind of became friends with later on.

02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:07.960
[Guest 2]: And that's when he knew that this is my kind of a guy and my friendship started with Tendulkar.

02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:14.960
[Guest 2]: And in that journey to discover a champion and a whole lot of champions all over,

02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:17.960
[Guest 2]: starting to tour with Sunandan, with me.

02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:23.960
[Guest 2]: And the big moment was obviously when I was part of the ESPN commentary team in 2006.

02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:27.960
[Guest 2]: So yeah, coming back from the 2004 Asia Cup performance,

02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:32.960
[Guest 2]: it got reinforced that boss, you're here to stay, it was my gateway to the world of cricket.

02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:35.960
[Guest 2]: Comedy was just one way to reach there.

02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:38.960
[Unknown]: Cricket was never a way to reach there.

02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:42.960
[Guest 2]: But yeah, at least making fun of cricketers and creating jokes around the game

02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:44.960
[Guest 2]: kind of made me go closer to the game.

02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:48.960
[Guest 2]: And that's when, you know, things started happening, corporate shows started happening

02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:52.960
[Guest 2]: and the big break happened, which was 2006 ESPN,

02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:55.960
[Guest 2]: when they called me to be part of the commentary box.

02:16:55.960 --> 02:17:00.960
[Guest 2]: Now, up until now, you have to understand that Harsha Bhogle is the only external person

02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:01.960
[Guest 2]: who's in the commentary box.

02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:05.960
[Guest 2]: Gautam Bhimani is doing picture stories, but he's still not in the commentary box.

02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:08.960
[Guest 2]: But I have been called to be in the commentary box,

02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:13.960
[Guest 2]: obviously with a view of making Test Cricket interesting in terms of, you know,

02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:15.960
[Guest 2]: what's happening with the broadcast.

02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:18.960
[Guest 2]: So though I was in the comm box for certain periods,

02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:21.960
[Guest 2]: I was mainly doing a show called T-Spot,

02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:25.960
[Guest 2]: which was in tea at the TA interval break along with Alan Wilkins.

02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:30.960
[Guest 2]: But I was in conversation with Waseem Akram during the game in between and so on and so forth.

02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:33.960
[Guest 2]: And Gavaskar and Shastri and Harsha and all of that.

02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:38.960
[Guest 2]: That was a big, big break for me because I thought that now they are kind of accepting me

02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:41.960
[Guest 2]: as somebody who understands the game beyond the comedy.

02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:42.960
[Guest 2]: And this is 2006.

02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:47.960
[Guest 2]: So two years of active comedy had already happened.

02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:52.960
[Guest 2]: And so looking forward to going to South Africa, three test match series.

02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:54.960
[Guest 2]: There was a chance everybody was saying that,

02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:57.960
[Guest 2]: hey, there's a good chance that India will beat South Africa in South Africa.

02:17:57.960 --> 02:17:59.960
[Guest 2]: So there was this buzz in the commentary box.

02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:02.960
[Guest 2]: And it so happened that we reached there.

02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:05.960
[Guest 2]: Indian team was in good spirits and we won the first test match.

02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:07.960
[Guest 2]: If you remember, that was that big test.

02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:11.960
[Guest 2]: And we thought that from there on, things will go good for us, which didn't happen.

02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:16.960
[Guest 2]: Now I am there. I'm doing my stuff, slowly getting popularity.

02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:20.960
[Guest 2]: Because see, at the end of the day, cricket experts are a lot.

02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:25.960
[Guest 2]: But when you add humor to it, suddenly there's this vibe in the box and the broadcast,

02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:28.960
[Guest 2]: which everybody is enjoying and stuff like that.

02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:35.960
[Guest 2]: But one incident happened there that kind of put me off commentary forever.

02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:38.960
[Guest 2]: And that was during, I think, the second test match.

02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:41.960
[Guest 2]: I don't remember whether it was at Durban or was it the first test match.

02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:47.960
[Guest 2]: I think the last day of the first test match, where I was doing a small piece on the ground,

02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:52.960
[Guest 2]: near the pitch, which was kind of a humorous take on the first test match.

02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:58.960
[Guest 2]: And I was wearing India colors because I'd been told when I was going to South Africa by the Sony team.

02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:02.960
[Guest 2]: I mean, I was lucky to go to South Africa because earlier they wanted to shoot everything here.

02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:06.960
[Guest 2]: But because there was paucity of time, I finally got to come to South Africa.

02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:10.960
[Guest 2]: And I got these clothes from the Nike shop, which was the Indian attire.

02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:14.960
[Guest 2]: And by that time, that big deal with Nike had happened with the BCCI.

02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:16.960
[Guest 2]: So I wore that outfit.

02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:24.960
[Guest 2]: I went into the middle of the pitch and I was just about to record and walk in Sunil Gavaskar.

02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:27.960
[Guest 2]: And he says, why are you wearing these colors?

02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:33.960
[Guest 2]: So I got a shock of my life that in front of the entire crew and all these guys shouting at me.

02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:42.960
[Guest 2]: And I was 29-30, so I just stopped for a moment, but I didn't say anything to him.

02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:45.960
[Guest 2]: He continued, you've not played test cricket for India.

02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:47.960
[Guest 2]: Why are you wearing the India colors?

02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:50.960
[Guest 2]: And this is just ridiculous what this has come to.

02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:55.960
[Guest 2]: Test match cricket has certain value and started giving me a lecture on the ground in front of everybody.

02:19:55.960 --> 02:20:01.960
[Guest 2]: Now, I am thinking this is an official merchandise that I've picked up from a Nike showroom.

02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:03.960
[Amit Varma]: Anybody can wear it.

02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:04.960
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:09.960
[Guest 2]: So the producer is there and I'm asking him that, what is the story?

02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:13.960
[Guest 2]: Suddenly I see Harsha Bhogle walk and Ravi Shastri walk close and say that,

02:20:13.960 --> 02:20:15.960
[Guest 2]: Sunny bhai, this is available in the shop.

02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:17.960
[Guest 2]: This is a Nike deal.

02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:19.960
[Guest 2]: Anybody in the audience can wear it also.

02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:26.960
[Guest 2]: No, no, this is just, you know, you test cricket is for pride and some shit he gave me for 20 seconds.

02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:28.960
[Guest 2]: I kept quiet.

02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:30.960
[Guest 2]: Did that episode a little bit.

02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:34.960
[Guest 2]: Now, that's when I realized that this guy is extremely moody.

02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:37.960
[Guest 2]: I walk up to the commentary box.

02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:41.960
[Guest 2]: I tell the producer that, you know, this is not something I'll appreciate.

02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:46.960
[Guest 2]: But he said, nahi yaar, moody aadmi hai, don't get upset and stuff like that.

02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:56.960
[Guest 2]: That same evening, if I'm not mistaken, was a small episode that I had to do with Gavaskar only along with Wasim Akram and Alan Wilkins.

02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:01.960
[Guest 2]: So at that point of time, there was this thing about wives and girlfriends coming to cricket tournaments.

02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:07.960
[Guest 2]: So when Alan asked me this question in that segment in On Tee Spot, I said that this is a question I cannot answer.

02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:10.960
[Guest 2]: I think I'll leave it to Wasim bhai and Sunny bhai.

02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:13.960
[Guest 2]: I don't know what Sunny bhai thought.

02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:16.960
[Guest 2]: He gave the answer and then he threw a big tantrum after that.

02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:19.960
[Unknown]: This is not right. Who are these people?

02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:22.960
[Guest 2]: And remember, I have worked with this guy in professional management group in my first job.

02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:24.960
[Guest 2]: So he knows me.

02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:28.960
[Guest 2]: And he started behaving so I went and said, Sunny bhai, did I say something wrong?

02:21:28.960 --> 02:21:30.960
[Guest 2]: I'll apologize and all of that.

02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:33.960
[Guest 2]: And then he said he didn't acknowledge me and he just walked away.

02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:37.960
[Guest 2]: That's when I went to the producer and I said, listen, give me my ticket back.

02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:40.960
[Guest 2]: I'm not going to take this shit anymore.

02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:42.960
[Guest 2]: I never wanted to be a broadcaster.

02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:45.960
[Guest 2]: You got me into broadcasting. I'm here to entertain.

02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:47.960
[Guest 2]: I will do a stand up act for your guests and whatever.

02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:49.960
[Guest 2]: But this is the behavior I will not tolerate.

02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:51.960
[Guest 2]: And the worst thing is he's my hero.

02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:54.960
[Guest 2]: I mean, we've idolized this guy.

02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:57.960
[Guest 2]: And he said, nahi yaar, wo aisa hi hai, yeh, wo, yeh, wo karke.

02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:00.960
[Guest 2]: But I said, chalo, theek hai, maan jate hain.

02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:02.960
[Guest 2]: So second test match, I had a good time.

02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:04.960
[Guest 2]: Third test match, we unfortunately kept down, we lost.

02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:07.960
[Guest 2]: But there were some good innings, great cricket to watch.

02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:14.960
[Guest 2]: But the baggage was still there because he was behaving very rudely.

02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:15.960
[Unknown]: Throughout?

02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:18.960
[Guest 2]: Throughout. Means he was not acknowledging me only.

02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:21.960
[Guest 2]: And then that day, I decided on my flight back.

02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:24.960
[Guest 2]: And interestingly, on the flight back, just before the flight,

02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:29.960
[Guest 2]: when I was driving to the airport, I got stopped by cops.

02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:35.960
[Guest 2]: And this is like, you know, I'm an ICC, whatever, ESPN commentator.

02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:39.960
[Guest 2]: They stopped me in the middle of the journey to the airport.

02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:42.960
[Guest 2]: And those two cops looked at me and said, you know, open, open, open.

02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:44.960
[Guest 2]: Drugs, drugs, drugs.

02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:46.960
[Guest 2]: And I'm like, what is wrong?

02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:48.960
[Guest 2]: And they're like, I'm going to the airport to catch my flight.

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:51.960
[Guest 2]: And they take all of the money out of my wallet.

02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:53.960
[Guest 2]: And say that, you know, you go like this.

02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:57.960
[Guest 2]: These are cops doing it to a commentator in South Africa.

02:22:57.960 --> 02:22:59.960
[Guest 2]: Going, somebody going to the airport.

02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:02.960
[Guest 2]: Itna open pagalpan chal raha tha uss time.

02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:06.960
[Guest 2]: Anyway, airport mein main gaya, flight pe baitha.

02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:11.960
[Guest 2]: Aur maine kaha ki, broadcasting ke nazdeek, life mein kabhi nahi aane ka.

02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:17.960
[Guest 2]: Because what I had seen, Amit, was that Harsha had gone through all of this for a long time.

02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:21.960
[Guest 2]: But Harsha is obsessed by cricket and commentary.

02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:23.960
[Guest 2]: He can't do anything else.

02:23:23.960 --> 02:23:25.960
[Guest 2]: So he did not have the option that I had.

02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:28.960
[Guest 2]: Where I said, boss, yeh mereko yeh click ke nazdeek aane ka hi nahi.

02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:32.960
[Guest 2]: Because they will not accept anybody from the outside.

02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:34.960
[Guest 2]: It's not, means they're insecure.

02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:38.960
[Guest 2]: And specially Sunny bhai was insecure about any, that's what I thought.

02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:41.960
[Guest 2]: What was I going to do to Sunny Gavaskar?

02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:42.960
[Guest 2]: He's a living legend.

02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:45.960
[Guest 2]: And why am I going to do anything that is going to affect him?

02:23:45.960 --> 02:23:49.960
[Guest 2]: But then I realized that this is how it's going to be in commentary.

02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:53.960
[Guest 2]: If you are able to, and Harsha has taken all of this stress and the insults

02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:57.960
[Guest 2]: over a period of 24, 30, 40 years or whatever he's done broadcasting.

02:23:57.960 --> 02:23:58.960
[Guest 2]: But he knows this is his calling.

02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:00.960
[Guest 2]: There's nothing else I'll do.

02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:01.960
[Guest 2]: And therefore he did that.

02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:03.960
[Guest 2]: I said, I'm not going to do it.

02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:07.960
[Guest 2]: I came back and I'd heard that a lot of things happened in ESPN after that.

02:24:07.960 --> 02:24:12.960
[Guest 2]: I said, boss, stand up comedy karenge and I'll create my own ecosystem of content,

02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:15.960
[Guest 2]: which I will do on live shows.

02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:18.960
[Guest 2]: Luckily, YouTube had just started.

02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:24.960
[Guest 2]: So that clip of Seat Awards now was the first comedy clip on YouTube to go viral.

02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:27.960
[Guest 2]: So everybody knew what I was doing.

02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:32.960
[Guest 2]: And therefore I said that any content that comes, which is apart from broadcasting,

02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:33.960
[Guest 2]: I will do on cricket.

02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:36.960
[Guest 2]: And hopefully at some point of time, create my own content on YouTube.

02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:41.960
[Guest 2]: And I will leave this game from that point of view, because I realized that this is

02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:45.960
[Guest 2]: the only country where the board decides who the commentator is.

02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:47.960
[Guest 2]: It's not the broadcaster's prerogative.

02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:51.960
[Guest 2]: And these guys are not going to accept any outsider coming and stuff like that.

02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:52.960
[Guest 2]: And that's what changed my life.

02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:55.960
[Guest 2]: And I'm very happy that I didn't stay in broadcasting because I would not have

02:24:55.960 --> 02:25:00.960
[Guest 2]: been able to live this under pressure kind of life.

02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:02.960
[Guest 2]: Came back home.

02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:03.960
[Guest 2]: Thankfully, the corporate boom.

02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:10.960
[Guest 2]: And that was that period of great fun because every corporate was taking their

02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:15.960
[Guest 2]: dealers and listing employees to South Africa, to Greece.

02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:20.960
[Guest 2]: So with that 2007-12 period, I probably would have done hundreds and thousands of

02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:25.960
[Guest 2]: shows, 200-300 shows, just traveling abroad with 500 dealers.

02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:27.960
[Guest 2]: And sometimes I do it in my jokes.

02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:33.960
[Guest 2]: And I think that's to say that Gujarat became more vibrant, not because of the

02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:36.960
[Guest 2]: chief minister there, but because of Bangkok.

02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:42.960
[Guest 2]: Because all sales targets were dependent on going to Bangkok.

02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:47.960
[Guest 2]: And if you did well, and Gujaratis who had never gone beyond Bhavsar and Nadiad,

02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:49.960
[Guest 2]: they went to Bangkok and they were happy.

02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:50.960
[Guest 2]: They doubled their turnover.

02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:53.960
[Guest 2]: And sometimes I feel that we revived the Thailand economy.

02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:55.960
[Unknown]: They turned over and they turned over.

02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:58.960
[Unknown]: It was a family show.

02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:02.960
[Guest 2]: But Amit, you will not believe and Roshan will agree to this.

02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:07.960
[Unknown]: Every weekend we were in Bangkok because every corporate did gigs only in Bangkok.

02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:12.960
[Guest 2]: Thailand hates India because the kind of rada that Indian dealers have done in

02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:14.960
[Guest 1]: Bangkok is unbelievable.

02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:16.960
[Guest 1]: I'll just tell you one small incident.

02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:19.960
[Guest 1]: We're doing one event together.

02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:24.960
[Guest 1]: And this is for a erstwhile computer company.

02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:25.960
[Guest 1]: And we've done the thing and whatever.

02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:26.960
[Guest 1]: And the show's gone very well.

02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:27.960
[Guest 1]: Award night has happened.

02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:29.960
[Guest 1]: We guys are back at the hotel.

02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:34.960
[Guest 1]: And the marketing director of the company is a good friend of ours.

02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:35.960
[Guest 1]: And she's very happy.

02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:37.960
[Guest 1]: Everything's gone well.

02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:40.960
[Guest 1]: Now all these dealers after the show have gone to town.

02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:42.960
[Guest 1]: And they've come back with people.

02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:45.960
[Guest 1]: And as they're entering the hotel or whatever, suddenly they see that in the

02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:49.960
[Guest 1]: lobby is standing the marketing director and we all are behind.

02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:51.960
[Guest 1]: Now they have told all the women to buzz off.

02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:53.960
[Guest 1]: And they've entered the lobby.

02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:55.960
[Guest 1]: And these girls are holding their passports saying, I'm clean.

02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:56.960
[Guest 1]: I'm clean.

02:26:56.960 --> 02:26:58.960
[Guest 1]: I can come to your room.

02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:00.960
[Unknown]: And they're saying, no, no.

02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:01.960
[Unknown]: Madam.

02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:02.960
[Unknown]: Sister.

02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:03.960
[Unknown]: Madam.

02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:04.960
[Unknown]: Sister, madam.

02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:05.960
[Unknown]: Sister, madam.

02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:07.960
[Guest 1]: I mean, you've seen so many of these scenes.

02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:08.960
[Guest 1]: It's crazy.

02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:12.960
[Guest 1]: People would, you know, some dealers would shoplift.

02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:13.960
[Unknown]: They would do.

02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:14.960
[Guest 1]: People would because, you know.

02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:16.960
[Unknown]: They picked her up.

02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:17.960
[Guest 1]: They picked her up.

02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:19.960
[Guest 1]: I mean, they're stopping her.

02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:20.960
[Guest 1]: They're saving her from arrest.

02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:21.960
[Guest 2]: What a story.

02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:22.960
[Unknown]: No, no.

02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:25.960
[Guest 1]: Indians had not traveled abroad to that extent.

02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:28.960
[Guest 2]: And now all these companies were taking, which is good for us, right?

02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:30.960
[Guest 2]: Because we were entertaining these people abroad.

02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:36.960
[Guest 2]: But many of the stories were, they did not know how to use an Indian.

02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:37.960
[Guest 2]: Sorry.

02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:38.960
[Guest 1]: Western toilet.

02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:39.960
[Guest 1]: Western toilet.

02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:45.960
[Guest 2]: And they would do things on that toilet which had to be sorted by the company

02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:47.960
[Guest 2]: heads before they had exited the hotel.

02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:49.960
[Guest 2]: It was a chaotic time.

02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:51.960
[Amit Varma]: What would they do in the toilets?

02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:54.960
[Guest 1]: Just let your imagination wander.

02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:55.960
[Guest 1]: No, no.

02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:56.960
[Guest 1]: Not just that.

02:27:56.960 --> 02:27:57.960
[Guest 1]: I'm telling you.

02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:02.960
[Guest 1]: So, occasionally when people used to go through security check and they had to open their bags,

02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:07.960
[Guest 1]: they would have bath towels, bathrobes, soaps.

02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:11.960
[Guest 1]: Someone even carried the safe from the hotel.

02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:13.960
[Unknown]: It was crazy.

02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:15.960
[Unknown]: Sir, was it in the room?

02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:17.960
[Unknown]: It was in the room.

02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:19.960
[Unknown]: They've taken everything from the room.

02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:20.960
[Unknown]: Oh, my God.

02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:22.960
[Guest 2]: But it was crazy.

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:23.960
[Guest 2]: Cruises, performing.

02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:30.960
[Guest 2]: And you know, we were always, the fillers were always just before the item number performed.

02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:35.960
[Guest 2]: So all the actresses or whatever, it was called item number show.

02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:39.960
[Guest 2]: And after the stand-up comedy would come the item number.

02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:42.960
[Guest 2]: And so I was always in trouble.

02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:46.960
[Guest 2]: Because dealers, internal audience, they would still listen to humor and all of that.

02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:50.960
[Unknown]: But the dealers would want the item number to come.

02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:54.960
[Guest 2]: So for that 20 minutes for me in between, I was the big wall between them.

02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:59.960
[Guest 2]: But still I managed to do 3,000 shows, which shows how hot I am.

02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:00.960
[Amit Varma]: 3,000 shows?

02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:01.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:02.960
[Amit Varma]: My God.

02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:04.960
[Guest 2]: So that was a fun journey.

02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:09.960
[Guest 2]: But this is where my intellectual part of the story started.

02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:11.960
[Guest 2]: The touring was going on.

02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:16.960
[Guest 2]: So because I had befriended the cricketers by now, in the middle of a tour,

02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:23.960
[Guest 2]: having a nice meal or dinner with, say, Rahul Dravid, or for that matter, Asaurav Ganguly,

02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:30.960
[Guest 2]: maybe sometimes members from the opposition team who had seen me perform in probably an ICC cricket event somewhere.

02:29:30.960 --> 02:29:34.960
[Guest 2]: This was where my actual journey started.

02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:38.960
[Guest 2]: To live international sport at the time when the action is happening.

02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:43.960
[Guest 2]: So when you know the next session for the test match is interesting,

02:29:43.960 --> 02:29:46.960
[Guest 2]: and you've had dinner with, say, Anil Kumble the night before,

02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:50.960
[Guest 2]: because you bumped into him in some Indian restaurant,

02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:52.960
[Guest 2]: and then he's kind of sharing the dynamics.

02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:59.960
[Guest 2]: That's when the games kind of started opening up for me,

02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:02.960
[Guest 2]: where I started understanding the psychology of sport,

02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:07.960
[Guest 2]: the physicality of sport, the human behavior side of it,

02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:11.960
[Guest 2]: the competitive advantage that people get out of sledging.

02:30:11.960 --> 02:30:13.960
[Guest 2]: What is purposeful practice?

02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:15.960
[Guest 2]: What is team dynamics?

02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:18.960
[Guest 2]: What is advantage during sessions?

02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:20.960
[Guest 2]: What is mental makeup?

02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:21.960
[Guest 2]: What is routine?

02:30:21.960 --> 02:30:23.960
[Guest 2]: What is visualization?

02:30:23.960 --> 02:30:27.960
[Guest 2]: So this started getting easier and easier for me to understand,

02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:31.960
[Guest 2]: because I was hearing it from the horse's mouth at the time when the action was happening.

02:30:31.960 --> 02:30:37.960
[Guest 2]: So 2006 onwards to 2013 till Sachin retired,

02:30:37.960 --> 02:30:41.960
[Guest 2]: that seven years I lived cricket in its totality.

02:30:41.960 --> 02:30:45.960
[Guest 2]: Because even before the Sydney Gate happened,

02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:48.960
[Guest 2]: or after the Sydney Gate happened, I was in that press conference,

02:30:48.960 --> 02:30:51.960
[Guest 2]: what Robak was writing about Ricky Ponting,

02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:54.960
[Guest 2]: my interaction with Ricky Ponting during that particular tour.

02:30:54.960 --> 02:30:57.960
[Guest 2]: So this was like gold dust coming to me and saying,

02:30:57.960 --> 02:31:00.960
[Guest 2]: forget the comedy, this is what you've been waiting for.

02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:03.960
[Guest 2]: And that was the reason that book happened,

02:31:03.960 --> 02:31:06.960
[Guest 2]: because I thought that, hey, I am privy to so many of these stories,

02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:11.960
[Guest 2]: real time, let me try and see if I can use humor and put it in a book format.

02:31:11.960 --> 02:31:15.960
[Guest 2]: That is where I got interested in sports psychology,

02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:19.960
[Guest 2]: where I said, boss, the dynamics of understanding human behavior

02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:23.960
[Guest 2]: in the context of high performance sport is the ultimate you can ever get.

02:31:23.960 --> 02:31:27.960
[Guest 2]: And cricket is a very amazing game because it has so many facets,

02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:30.960
[Guest 2]: unlike football where, you know, whatever,

02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:32.960
[Guest 2]: number of people playing for one and a half hours and it's over.

02:31:32.960 --> 02:31:35.960
[Guest 2]: There's a wicketkeeper who has his own story.

02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:38.960
[Guest 2]: There is a third man who has his own story.

02:31:38.960 --> 02:31:42.960
[Guest 2]: There is a spin bowler who's coming with a new ball who has his own story,

02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:44.960
[Guest 2]: which Ashwin beautifully explains in What The Duck,

02:31:44.960 --> 02:31:47.960
[Guest 2]: my show where he talks about, you know, Ajinkya Rahane giving him a new ball

02:31:47.960 --> 02:31:51.960
[Guest 2]: because he realized that there's moisture and spin might help him in Melbourne.

02:31:51.960 --> 02:31:53.960
[Guest 2]: And that's how he got Steve Smith out.

02:31:53.960 --> 02:31:58.960
[Guest 2]: So all these stories, imagine happening to you while the process is on,

02:31:58.960 --> 02:32:00.960
[Unknown]: was like, means I was learning and learning.

02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:02.960
[Guest 2]: I said, cricket is life.

02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:05.960
[Guest 2]: So many things are being taught to me through this wonderful game.

02:32:05.960 --> 02:32:07.960
[Guest 2]: And I was growing as a person.

02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:12.960
[Guest 2]: And I thought that cricket is actually the real subject I should have learned in school.

02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:14.960
[Guest 2]: And then the unraveling of Tendulkar.

02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:17.960
[Guest 2]: And I'm understanding why this happened.

02:32:17.960 --> 02:32:19.960
[Guest 2]: Attention to detail, the preparation.

02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:23.960
[Guest 2]: 2011, I remember Sachin Tendulkar was not in form.

02:32:23.960 --> 02:32:25.960
[Guest 2]: Rahul Dravid was getting bold to Hilfenhaus.

02:32:25.960 --> 02:32:30.960
[Guest 2]: Every test match that he played, we lost that series after winning,

02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:33.960
[Guest 2]: after losing a close game at Melbourne.

02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:36.960
[Guest 2]: I remember going with Sachin to a vineyard,

02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:39.960
[Guest 2]: and he explaining to me the dynamics of how we lost that test.

02:32:39.960 --> 02:32:44.960
[Guest 2]: And, you know, talking to Rahul about how his mental frame was extremely good

02:32:44.960 --> 02:32:45.960
[Guest 2]: during the Melbourne test.

02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:47.960
[Guest 2]: And after that, it started going down.

02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:49.960
[Guest 2]: This was a lesson in psychology.

02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:52.960
[Guest 2]: This was a lesson in human behavior,

02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:53.960
[Guest 2]: which I was just grasping.

02:32:53.960 --> 02:32:58.960
[Guest 2]: I said, hey, let me just continue my comedy till the time I can

02:32:58.960 --> 02:33:01.960
[Guest 2]: in order to get a sense of what is happening in the world.

02:33:01.960 --> 02:33:05.960
[Guest 2]: But I realized that my money was coming through corporate India.

02:33:05.960 --> 02:33:08.960
[Guest 2]: And that's when, as Roshan said, that the musical part of it,

02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:13.960
[Guest 2]: I started developing observations, politics, current affairs,

02:33:13.960 --> 02:33:17.960
[Guest 2]: all these things I started writing on my own so that my act would become more robust.

02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:19.960
[Guest 2]: Because at any given point of time,

02:33:19.960 --> 02:33:21.960
[Guest 2]: a stand-up comedian should have three hours of material.

02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:25.960
[Guest 2]: So your 20 minutes get repeated, which is your best,

02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:27.960
[Guest 2]: because you're safe,

02:33:27.960 --> 02:33:30.960
[Guest 2]: unless you know the audience is a little open with experimentation.

02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:32.960
[Guest 2]: Because unlike the comedy movement,

02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:37.960
[Guest 2]: which started with say Veer Das and Papa CJ sometime in 2008-9,

02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:40.960
[Guest 2]: I had no concept of experimenting in a club,

02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:43.960
[Guest 2]: getting my material tested and doing it in a corporate show.

02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:46.960
[Guest 2]: All my testing was happening on real-time shows.

02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:49.960
[Guest 2]: So my risk-taking ability went down

02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:53.960
[Guest 2]: because I could not have risked material in an Asian paint show.

02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:57.960
[Guest 2]: So what I would do is make three to five minutes of new material.

02:33:57.960 --> 02:34:00.960
[Guest 2]: If I would go from Asian paints to Procter & Gamble,

02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:02.960
[Guest 2]: I would test this five minutes.

02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:07.960
[Guest 2]: From Procter & Gamble to ICICI, I would test another two minutes.

02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:11.960
[Guest 2]: But it took me six months to make 30 new minutes.

02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:13.960
[Guest 2]: Whereas if I was a club comedian,

02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:15.960
[Guest 2]: I would have tested material every day.

02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:17.960
[Guest 2]: But by the time this culture happened,

02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:19.960
[Guest 2]: I had already done 8-10 years of work.

02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:21.960
[Guest 2]: And then again, inertia had set in.

02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:23.960
[Guest 1]: And I was saying that I had bargained for comedy.

02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:25.960
[Guest 1]: It was input-output.

02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:27.960
[Guest 1]: I told him, why don't you do a TV special?

02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:31.960
[Guest 1]: He says, I will do the same joke 100 times in different corporate shows.

02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:33.960
[Guest 1]: It's new.

02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:35.960
[Guest 1]: Once I did it on TV, everyone heard it.

02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:37.960
[Guest 1]: And it's a philosophy.

02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:39.960
[Guest 1]: Because I work with Veer and Zakir and all these guys.

02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:41.960
[Guest 1]: And I see them.

02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:43.960
[Guest 1]: They will develop material for a year.

02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:45.960
[Guest 1]: They will test it.

02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:47.960
[Guest 1]: Possibly take another year to hone it.

02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:49.960
[Guest 1]: And it's got a two-year kind of cycle.

02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:51.960
[Guest 1]: At the end of the two years, they'll do a TV special.

02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:53.960
[Guest 1]: Then that material is over.

02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:55.960
[Guest 1]: And then it moves on to a new chunk or whatever.

02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:57.960
[Guest 2]: I really think Saty could have done that.

02:34:57.960 --> 02:34:59.960
[Guest 2]: But what happened was that this was not in my prime.

02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:01.960
[Unknown]: I had done my prime.

02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:03.960
[Guest 2]: And I was excited by this other thing.

02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:05.960
[Guest 2]: Then that comedy movement started.

02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:07.960
[Guest 2]: And Roshan used to tell me that

02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:09.960
[Guest 2]: Saty, you come in this zone.

02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:11.960
[Guest 2]: You are way ahead of them.

02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:13.960
[Guest 2]: I said, I am not in the game.

02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:15.960
[Guest 2]: What do I do now?

02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:17.960
[Guest 2]: I am enjoying here.

02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:19.960
[Guest 2]: And that's where I think it's my fault that I didn't push myself.

02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:21.960
[Guest 2]: I could have probably got

02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:23.960
[Guest 2]: 6 or 8 specials by now.

02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:25.960
[Guest 2]: Because I had so much of material gathered over a period of time.

02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:29.960
[Guest 2]: But then this interested me more.

02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:31.960
[Guest 2]: And then this journey started.

02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:33.960
[Guest 2]: Which led to what the duck might show.

02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:35.960
[Guest 2]: And as we go further,

02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:37.960
[Guest 2]: I will probably break down on various

02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:39.960
[Guest 2]: special qualities of the

02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:41.960
[Guest 2]: sports people that I saw.

02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:43.960
[Guest 2]: And probably put it in context of

02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:45.960
[Guest 2]: what is that one thing I learnt out of those players.

02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:47.960
[Guest 2]: But this journey

02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:49.960
[Guest 2]: of unravelling a high performance athlete

02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:51.960
[Guest 2]: was the best thing I experienced

02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:53.960
[Amit Varma]: in my life.

02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:55.960
[Amit Varma]: So 5 or 6 things I want to double click on.

02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:57.960
[Amit Varma]: And one of them is this.

02:35:57.960 --> 02:35:59.960
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned that initially,

02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:01.960
[Amit Varma]: it was an accident. You were good at imitating people.

02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:03.960
[Amit Varma]: You got a chance. It was funny.

02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:05.960
[Amit Varma]: It was great. It worked.

02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:07.960
[Amit Varma]: Then you go to South Africa.

02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:09.960
[Amit Varma]: And it works so well.

02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:11.960
[Amit Varma]: And you are fully in that mahal.

02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:13.960
[Amit Varma]: And you are thinking, this is working for me.

02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:15.960
[Amit Varma]: This is what my comedy will be.

02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:17.960
[Amit Varma]: And it seems there that what happens is

02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:19.960
[Amit Varma]: that the incentives that are at play

02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:21.960
[Amit Varma]: are taking your comedy

02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:23.960
[Amit Varma]: into a particular direction.

02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:25.960
[Amit Varma]: And not allowing you

02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:27.960
[Amit Varma]: to take it into other directions

02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:29.960
[Amit Varma]: which could also have been rewarding for you.

02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:31.960
[Amit Varma]: And I am thinking in terms of creators.

02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:33.960
[Amit Varma]: These are choices

02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:35.960
[Amit Varma]: all creators are confronted with at some point

02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:37.960
[Amit Varma]: in time. You can take your work

02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:39.960
[Amit Varma]: in one direction or you can

02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:41.960
[Amit Varma]: take it into the other direction.

02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:43.960
[Amit Varma]: And you make a choice. And that choice changes

02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:45.960
[Amit Varma]: what you do. And then what you do changes

02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:47.960
[Amit Varma]: who you are. And you become a completely

02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:49.960
[Amit Varma]: different person. Like maybe for example

02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:51.960
[Amit Varma]: if the actual stand-up scene

02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:53.960
[Amit Varma]: if the scene starts earlier

02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:55.960
[Amit Varma]: or you come later.

02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:57.960
[Amit Varma]: Then you might say that cricket is fine.

02:36:57.960 --> 02:36:59.960
[Amit Varma]: That's just one thing. Let me also do this.

02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:01.960
[Amit Varma]: And then you become the Veer Das or whatever.

02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:03.960
[Amit Varma]: Or the line you chose

02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:05.960
[Amit Varma]: which was to go sort of

02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:07.960
[Amit Varma]: much more into cricket.

02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:09.960
[Amit Varma]: So did you feel at the time

02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:11.960
[Amit Varma]: that it was a compromise that you were making

02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:13.960
[Amit Varma]: that there was a trade-off involved?

02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:15.960
[Amit Varma]: Or were you just fully happy saying that

02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:17.960
[Amit Varma]: this is fine. Let me just not overthink it.

02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:19.960
[Guest 2]: Just go with it. Totally.

02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:21.960
[Guest 2]: As we discussed, there was

02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:23.960
[Guest 2]: no calling of stand-up.

02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:25.960
[Guest 2]: People like Veer and CJ

02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:27.960
[Guest 2]: and all those, they wanted to become

02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:29.960
[Guest 2]: comedians.

02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:31.960
[Guest 2]: Veer Das has been studying

02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:33.960
[Guest 2]: comedy since the time he finished

02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:35.960
[Guest 2]: his graduation and stuff like that.

02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:37.960
[Guest 2]: I was an accidental comedian.

02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:39.960
[Guest 2]: But for me what was important was

02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:41.960
[Guest 2]: my first love which was cricket.

02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:43.960
[Guest 2]: And therefore the comedy was just a way

02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:45.960
[Guest 2]: to reach the world of cricket.

02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:47.960
[Guest 2]: The moment it started working and I realized that

02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:49.960
[Guest 2]: boss I have it in me to explore

02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:51.960
[Guest 2]: the larger canvas. That is when

02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:53.960
[Guest 2]: I started doing other material to survive

02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:55.960
[Guest 2]: in this world. And then obviously

02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:57.960
[Guest 2]: there was a business model at play. The incentive was

02:37:57.960 --> 02:37:59.960
[Guest 2]: very very simple. If I have to continue

02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:01.960
[Guest 2]: my stand-up career in the corporate

02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:03.960
[Guest 2]: which is going to pay my bills and not cricket

02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:05.960
[Guest 2]: because cricket is a choice I have made.

02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:07.960
[Guest 2]: I have stayed away from broadcast because broadcast

02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:09.960
[Guest 2]: is where the money is.

02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:11.960
[Guest 2]: So I have stayed away from that. So I will get my

02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:13.960
[Guest 2]: ROI from my corporate shows

02:38:13.960 --> 02:38:15.960
[Guest 2]: for which I now need to start talking

02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:17.960
[Guest 2]: about what is happening around the world, human

02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:19.960
[Guest 2]: behavior, little bit of Bollywood

02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:21.960
[Guest 2]: music and all of that.

02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:23.960
[Guest 2]: That keeps my system going and

02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:25.960
[Guest 2]: makes me go into the world that I love

02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:27.960
[Guest 2]: to be in. So my ability

02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:29.960
[Guest 2]: to spend two months in Australia

02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:31.960
[Guest 2]: during a test series was actually

02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:33.960
[Guest 2]: only one or two shows. The extension

02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:35.960
[Guest 2]: was paid by me.

02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:37.960
[Guest 2]: So that I could fund

02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:39.960
[Guest 2]: only because I could do this.

02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:41.960
[Guest 2]: Unfortunately because I didn't have the drive for

02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:43.960
[Guest 2]: comedy which is like

02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:45.960
[Guest 2]: let's do a new act. Let's do this.

02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:47.960
[Guest 2]: Let's do shows in the world. I don't want to do it.

02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:49.960
[Guest 2]: Australia, South Africa, West Indies

02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:51.960
[Guest 2]: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh

02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:53.960
[Guest 2]: this is done. So I think

02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:55.960
[Guest 2]: it was a problem of again the core

02:38:55.960 --> 02:38:57.960
[Guest 2]: point that I made that I was just happy

02:38:57.960 --> 02:38:59.960
[Guest 2]: in the current moment and that

02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:01.960
[Guest 2]: didn't drive excellence from a creative perspective.

02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:03.960
[Guest 2]: Which today I don't have any regrets

02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:05.960
[Guest 2]: but I thought I should have pushed myself a little

02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:07.960
[Guest 2]: bit more to explore this so much.

02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:09.960
[Guest 2]: Today I feel because I am

02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:11.960
[Guest 2]: now evolved into, I want

02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:13.960
[Guest 2]: to know more about so many different

02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:15.960
[Guest 2]: things under the sun which was not

02:39:15.960 --> 02:39:17.960
[Guest 2]: there 10 years back.

02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:19.960
[Guest 2]: In the last 8 to 9 years

02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:21.960
[Guest 2]: probably I have said that hey

02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:23.960
[Guest 2]: I don't even want to do comedy now.

02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:25.960
[Guest 2]: I want to actually try something completely different.

02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:27.960
[Guest 2]: Because when your

02:39:27.960 --> 02:39:29.960
[Guest 2]: growth stops

02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:31.960
[Guest 2]: then you realize that

02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:33.960
[Guest 2]: boss that profession is not worth chasing.

02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:35.960
[Guest 2]: And that has happened to me

02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:37.960
[Guest 2]: every 5-6 years with what I have done.

02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:39.960
[Guest 2]: So today comedy is absolutely

02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:41.960
[Guest 2]: not interested at all. But now I am putting

02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:43.960
[Guest 2]: a frame to myself and saying that

02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:45.960
[Guest 2]: hey can I spend

02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:47.960
[Guest 2]: 3 sessions with Vijay Gokhale

02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:49.960
[Guest 2]: who gave me a great perspective on China

02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:51.960
[Guest 2]: and can I put something interesting which

02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:53.960
[Guest 2]: may not be pure stand up but a perspective

02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:55.960
[Guest 2]: on what happened from Deng to

02:39:55.960 --> 02:39:57.960
[Guest 2]: Xi Jinping. I am thinking on those lines

02:39:57.960 --> 02:39:59.960
[Guest 2]: it may never happen. I am just giving

02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:01.960
[Guest 2]: you a China example because it just

02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:03.960
[Guest 2]: happened 15 days back. But

02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:05.960
[Guest 2]: maybe my way of comedy

02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:07.960
[Guest 2]: is now to explore areas

02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:09.960
[Guest 2]: because what is the beauty of comedy

02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:11.960
[Guest 2]: is the moment you want to look at humor

02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:13.960
[Guest 2]: in a mundane subject

02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:15.960
[Guest 2]: your ability to

02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:17.960
[Guest 2]: grasp things becomes stronger. Because comedy

02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:19.960
[Guest 2]: means thinking. And that's why

02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:21.960
[Guest 2]: if I am reading a book today I would take

02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:23.960
[Guest 2]: 6 months to finish a big book because

02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:25.960
[Guest 2]: every 8 pages I would be

02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:27.960
[Guest 2]: probably thinking that this is like this

02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:29.960
[Guest 2]: we can treat it like this. There is a correlation in this.

02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:31.960
[Guest 2]: Comedy is what? Joining

02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:33.960
[Guest 2]: two dots. You have

02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:35.960
[Guest 2]: read this and this. When you

02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:37.960
[Guest 2]: add this in comedy, you get fun out of it.

02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:39.960
[Guest 2]: So today I am seeing if I

02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:41.960
[Guest 2]: can evolve myself and use

02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:43.960
[Guest 2]: comedy for something else to

02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:45.960
[Guest 2]: get knowledge and be curious

02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:47.960
[Guest 2]: about a different world which I did for cricket.

02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:49.960
[Guest 2]: But it's still

02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:51.960
[Guest 2]: an exploratory thought. Unfortunately

02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:53.960
[Guest 2]: my outcome has never been that

02:40:53.960 --> 02:40:55.960
[Guest 2]: I make a great creative piece.

02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:57.960
[Guest 2]: And that is what Roshan always criticizes

02:40:57.960 --> 02:40:59.960
[Guest 2]: me for. Why aren't you

02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:01.960
[Guest 2]: giving a creative output?

02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:03.960
[Guest 2]: I am not able to do that.

02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:05.960
[Guest 2]: What is going on

02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:07.960
[Guest 2]: and survival for that moment

02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:09.960
[Guest 2]: Tomorrow he tells me that

02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:11.960
[Guest 2]: hey I am doing a show. You have to make a 20 minute

02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:13.960
[Guest 2]: piece on this. Then I will go and do it.

02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:15.960
[Guest 2]: But that's not creative.

02:41:15.960 --> 02:41:17.960
[Guest 2]: That is

02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:19.960
[Guest 2]: this beautiful word that Vijay Tendulkar

02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:21.960
[Guest 2]: only told me once.

02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:23.960
[Guest 2]: I asked him what is creative?

02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:25.960
[Guest 2]: He said urgency.

02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:27.960
[Guest 2]: I didn't understand this. He said

02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:29.960
[Guest 2]: Vikram, sometimes a lot of

02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:31.960
[Guest 2]: creativity is wasted.

02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:33.960
[Guest 2]: I was an editor of Maharashtra Times.

02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:35.960
[Guest 2]: I used to get this much time

02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:37.960
[Guest 2]: and I used to write my story

02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:39.960
[Guest 2]: on the train. And I had

02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:41.960
[Guest 2]: deadlines to submit that story.

02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:43.960
[Guest 2]: And my best creative work happened in

02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:45.960
[Guest 2]: deadlines. So that urgency of

02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:47.960
[Guest 2]: the project helped me get the most

02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:49.960
[Guest 2]: creative I could ever get.

02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:51.960
[Guest 2]: Now some people might disagree

02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:53.960
[Guest 2]: with this theory. But I think this is a very

02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:55.960
[Guest 2]: interesting theory because my good creative

02:41:55.960 --> 02:41:57.960
[Guest 2]: work also has come under pressure.

02:41:57.960 --> 02:41:59.960
[Guest 2]: But because I was a freelancer

02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:01.960
[Guest 2]: my pressure on myself was not good enough.

02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:03.960
[Guest 1]: This is the, Saty will not

02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:05.960
[Guest 1]: admit it, this is the M-cube theory

02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:07.960
[Guest 1]: of Vikram Saty. Middle class

02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:09.960
[Guest 1]: Maharashtrian millionaire.

02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:11.960
[Guest 1]: Look, I had

02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:13.960
[Guest 1]: a very small area. I was getting

02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:15.960
[Guest 1]: salary, that was enough.

02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:17.960
[Guest 1]: Suddenly I discovered comedy.

02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:19.960
[Guest 1]: From comedy to cash register.

02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:21.960
[Guest 1]: He was raking it in. Sometimes

02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:23.960
[Guest 1]: when I tried to put numbers, he gets so shy.

02:42:23.960 --> 02:42:25.960
[Guest 1]: He doesn't even discuss his own money

02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:27.960
[Guest 1]: with anyone in his life.

02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:29.960
[Guest 1]: You will get it. You are printing.

02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:31.960
[Guest 1]: Favorite life.

02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:33.960
[Guest 1]: My thing is, my math

02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:35.960
[Guest 1]: immediately works. If you do 3000 shows

02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:37.960
[Guest 1]: and I calculate,

02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:39.960
[Guest 1]: put a base of 1 lakh.

02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:41.960
[Guest 1]: It will be 30 crores.

02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:43.960
[Guest 1]: No, I used to do 2000 in the beginning.

02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:45.960
[Guest 1]: But

02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:47.960
[Guest 1]: the logic is, now what happened?

02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:49.960
[Guest 1]: So you found that

02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:51.960
[Guest 1]: source, creative goal

02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:53.960
[Guest 1]: and comedy was never his goal.

02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:55.960
[Guest 1]: Right. But it was a combination

02:42:55.960 --> 02:42:57.960
[Guest 1]: as you said, what he said, that cricket, which was

02:42:57.960 --> 02:42:59.960
[Guest 1]: something he loved. Yes, intellectual

02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:01.960
[Guest 1]: pursuit. See, his desperation

02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:03.960
[Guest 1]: is to be known as an intellectual.

02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:05.960
[Guest 1]: I can tell you even today. Why did he write a book?

02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:07.960
[Guest 1]: Because when you write a book,

02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:09.960
[Guest 1]: you become a person.

02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:11.960
[Guest 1]: I will say more things.

02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:13.960
[Guest 1]: After that, why did he do TV?

02:43:13.960 --> 02:43:15.960
[Guest 1]: At that time, Sathe was a creative entrepreneur.

02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:17.960
[Guest 1]: He did 3 creative ventures.

02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:19.960
[Guest 1]: Multiple things. I do this, I do that.

02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:21.960
[Guest 1]: I do this, I do that.

02:43:21.960 --> 02:43:23.960
[Guest 1]: Then he realized, this is too much hard work.

02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:25.960
[Guest 1]: It was the

02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:27.960
[Guest 1]: middle class Maharashtrian.

02:43:27.960 --> 02:43:29.960
[Guest 1]: Why should I do this? Make 4 jokes.

02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:31.960
[Unknown]: Exactly.

02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:33.960
[Unknown]: In an event of 1 crore, 10% will be made.

02:43:33.960 --> 02:43:35.960
[Guest 1]: After 2 months

02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:37.960
[Guest 1]: of work, I could earn

02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:39.960
[Guest 1]: that 10% in 4 days.

02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:41.960
[Guest 1]: At that point in time, now in 2 days.

02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:43.960
[Guest 1]: Right.

02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:45.960
[Guest 1]: So why should I do it?

02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:47.960
[Guest 1]: Input, output, effort.

02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:49.960
[Guest 1]: Now everybody was doing TV.

02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:51.960
[Guest 1]: Everyone is doing it.

02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:53.960
[Guest 1]: YouTube, everyone is doing it.

02:43:53.960 --> 02:43:55.960
[Guest 1]: Then reluctant creator

02:43:55.960 --> 02:43:57.960
[Guest 1]: let's do it.

02:43:57.960 --> 02:43:59.960
[Guest 1]: But again,

02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:01.960
[Guest 1]: safe reluctant creator,

02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:03.960
[Guest 1]: won't do it without a sponsor.

02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:05.960
[Guest 1]: I found a person who will pay me

02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:07.960
[Guest 1]: to make the show, now I will make it.

02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:09.960
[Guest 1]: Sathe is risk taking.

02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:11.960
[Guest 1]: He didn't take the risk.

02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:13.960
[Guest 1]: But that's why I say,

02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:15.960
[Guest 1]: because what he has achieved

02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:17.960
[Guest 1]: within this framework is so

02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:19.960
[Guest 1]: good that if he just

02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:21.960
[Guest 1]: took that leap of faith.

02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:23.960
[Guest 1]: I will keep saying this all my life.

02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:25.960
[Guest 1]: Next time, avoid me like this.

02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:27.960
[Guest 1]: Let's meet.

02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:29.960
[Guest 1]: But that's what I keep

02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:31.960
[Guest 1]: saying that it's that.

02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:33.960
[Guest 1]: And I will tell you one thing.

02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:35.960
[Guest 1]: Now comedy, what he has not told you.

02:44:35.960 --> 02:44:37.960
[Guest 1]: Sathe believes that in the first 8-10

02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:39.960
[Guest 1]: years of comedy, he was lucky.

02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:41.960
[Guest 1]: No, he was bloody talented.

02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:43.960
[Guest 1]: And he had a niche.

02:44:43.960 --> 02:44:45.960
[Guest 1]: Sir, we spent 10 years in comedy.

02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:47.960
[Guest 1]: After that, there are comedians

02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:49.960
[Guest 1]: in every corner. You get them for 10,000

02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:51.960
[Guest 1]: or 50,000.

02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:53.960
[Guest 1]: You're seeing threat to livelihood.

02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:55.960
[Guest 1]: You don't need livelihood.

02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:57.960
[Guest 1]: Sathe's entire thing was

02:44:57.960 --> 02:44:59.960
[Guest 1]: he built a beautiful little house with this lovely

02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:01.960
[Guest 1]: little place below where you can have concerts.

02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:03.960
[Unknown]: Sathe is done with Akbar Azam.

02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:05.960
[Unknown]: His Navratans are going on every day.

02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:07.960
[Guest 1]: Everything is happening.

02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:09.960
[Guest 1]: Now what is left?

02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:11.960
[Guest 1]: Next intellectual level. Give back.

02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:13.960
[Guest 1]: That's one area to focus on.

02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:15.960
[Guest 1]: Where is the money coming from?

02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:17.960
[Guest 1]: Motivational speakers make more money.

02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:19.960
[Guest 1]: He knows.

02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:21.960
[Guest 1]: He gets 10.

02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:23.960
[Guest 1]: Host gets 2.5.

02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:25.960
[Guest 1]: How can I go in the range of 10?

02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:27.960
[Guest 1]: Sathe has figured out

02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:29.960
[Guest 1]: creative business.

02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:31.960
[Guest 1]: More than most of us.

02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:33.960
[Guest 1]: But only applies it to the individual enterprise.

02:45:33.960 --> 02:45:35.960
[Guest 1]: I keep pushing him.

02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:37.960
[Guest 1]: You should have used it for a bigger enterprise.

02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:39.960
[Guest 2]: To become an entrepreneur,

02:45:39.960 --> 02:45:41.960
[Guest 2]: you require a tremendous amount of drive.

02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:43.960
[Guest 2]: And I start with this thing

02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:45.960
[Guest 2]: that that drive is not in me, but in Roshan.

02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:47.960
[Guest 2]: The problem is

02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:49.960
[Guest 2]: I push Roshan, but he didn't

02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:51.960
[Amit Varma]: give me a stake in any business.

02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:53.960
[Guest 2]: Very sad.

02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:55.960
[Guest 2]: I pushed him so much, but he didn't give me a stake.

02:45:55.960 --> 02:45:57.960
[Guest 2]: That is where my

02:45:57.960 --> 02:45:59.960
[Amit Varma]: fiending went wrong.

02:45:59.960 --> 02:46:01.960
[Amit Varma]: I think of every creator

02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:03.960
[Amit Varma]: in a sense as an entrepreneur

02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:05.960
[Amit Varma]: of his own brand.

02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:07.960
[Amit Varma]: Do you actually think like that?

02:46:07.960 --> 02:46:09.960
[Amit Varma]: Or are you more like me?

02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:11.960
[Amit Varma]: Unfortunately, I should think more like that.

02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:13.960
[Amit Varma]: Or are you more like me where you are just

02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:15.960
[Amit Varma]: taking joy in the things that you do?

02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:17.960
[Guest 2]: Absolutely.

02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:19.960
[Guest 2]: It's sad that I can do marketing

02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:21.960
[Guest 2]: plans for everyone except for me.

02:46:21.960 --> 02:46:23.960
[Guest 2]: Because somehow again

02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:25.960
[Guest 2]: that thing, right?

02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:27.960
[Guest 2]: Intentionally friendship.

02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:29.960
[Guest 2]: In the same groove, what marketing for yourself?

02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:31.960
[Guest 2]: Does anyone do this?

02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:33.960
[Guest 2]: Till date,

02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:35.960
[Guest 2]: in my entire career, I have not done

02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:37.960
[Guest 2]: a single PR item.

02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:39.960
[Guest 2]: As an entertainer, you should have a PR company

02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:41.960
[Guest 2]: supporting you because your brand should be built.

02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:43.960
[Guest 2]: But for me, I have recommended

02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:45.960
[Guest 2]: PR companies to a hundred talent

02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:47.960
[Guest 2]: including cricketer that you should design

02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:49.960
[Guest 2]: your PR. This is what you should.

02:46:49.960 --> 02:46:51.960
[Guest 2]: But when it comes to myself, I can't do it because I have

02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:53.960
[Guest 2]: too much of a baggage of somebody

02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:55.960
[Guest 2]: my father or my mother telling me

02:46:55.960 --> 02:46:57.960
[Amit Varma]: that don't buy or don't think.

02:46:57.960 --> 02:46:59.960
[Guest 2]: Never do this. Your work should speak

02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:01.960
[Amit Varma]: for yourself. Yeah, I keep telling people

02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:03.960
[Amit Varma]: good product is the best marketing.

02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:05.960
[Amit Varma]: But maybe I am reflecting the same.

02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:07.960
[Amit Varma]: Somebody should sing

02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:09.960
[Amit Varma]: a song to you.

02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:11.960
[Unknown]: Exactly. That was my joke also.

02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:13.960
[Unknown]: That was your joke also.

02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:15.960
[Amit Varma]: I think

02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:17.960
[Unknown]: it's that MTV heritage

02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:19.960
[Amit Varma]: of celebrating bad jokes.

02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:21.960
[Amit Varma]: So, I have a couple of more questions

02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:23.960
[Amit Varma]: on your cricket times.

02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:25.960
[Amit Varma]: They both sort of arise

02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:27.960
[Amit Varma]: from the same situation

02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:29.960
[Amit Varma]: where you are someone who played cricket

02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:31.960
[Amit Varma]: passionately, knew the game,

02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:33.960
[Amit Varma]: understood the game really well.

02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:35.960
[Amit Varma]: But you didn't reach that level of that

02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:37.960
[Amit Varma]: Tendulkar and all of that.

02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:39.960
[Amit Varma]: And then later on, you make an

02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:41.960
[Amit Varma]: entry and you are with all of them.

02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:43.960
[Amit Varma]: So, now a couple

02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:45.960
[Amit Varma]: of sort of questions arise

02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:47.960
[Amit Varma]: here. And one is

02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:49.960
[Amit Varma]: that in terms of human beings

02:47:49.960 --> 02:47:51.960
[Amit Varma]: like all these guys are your personal friends now

02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:53.960
[Amit Varma]: right? But the thing is when you first interact

02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:55.960
[Amit Varma]: with them, they are also wary. Because they are

02:47:55.960 --> 02:47:57.960
[Amit Varma]: superstars and they are wary of

02:47:57.960 --> 02:47:59.960
[Amit Varma]: anybody else basically.

02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:01.960
[Amit Varma]: And some like Sunny Bhai

02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:03.960
[Amit Varma]: could be, you know, are also

02:48:03.960 --> 02:48:05.960
[Amit Varma]: fierce about protecting their turf.

02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:07.960
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise, they are wary, they have learned

02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:09.960
[Amit Varma]: to be wary, they have learned to distrust the press

02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:11.960
[Amit Varma]: and distrust others and they are kind of in their

02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:13.960
[Amit Varma]: own bubble. So, how was it

02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:15.960
[Amit Varma]: then? But I would imagine that once you

02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:17.960
[Amit Varma]: break past that bubble, for you to have that

02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:19.960
[Amit Varma]: personal relationship with them

02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:21.960
[Amit Varma]: becomes much easier because you

02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:23.960
[Amit Varma]: have also played cricket at Dadar Gymkhana

02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:25.960
[Amit Varma]: or Shivaji Park or wherever you played. You've gone

02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:27.960
[Amit Varma]: through the grind of doing all that.

02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:29.960
[Amit Varma]: You bowled to Sachin, you once said, which

02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:31.960
[Amit Varma]: in fact you must answer first, what was

02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:33.960
[Amit Varma]: that like? So,

02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:35.960
[Amit Varma]: how was it like breaking

02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:37.960
[Amit Varma]: through and then those personal relationships

02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:39.960
[Amit Varma]: and do you find that people

02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:41.960
[Amit Varma]: at the top like that

02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:43.960
[Amit Varma]: are a special kind of lonely?

02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:45.960
[Amit Varma]: Because you have access

02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:47.960
[Amit Varma]: cut off completely from the normal

02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:49.960
[Amit Varma]: world and the normal life and the

02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:51.960
[Amit Varma]: normal friendships like, let's meet at Starbucks

02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:53.960
[Amit Varma]: and you can't quite do that.

02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:55.960
[Amit Varma]: Or let's meet at Katte.

02:48:55.960 --> 02:48:57.960
[Amit Varma]: So, what was it

02:48:57.960 --> 02:48:59.960
[Amit Varma]: kind of, what was that like?

02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:01.960
[Amit Varma]: That once you break past the barrier, can you

02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:03.960
[Amit Varma]: also then just see them as normal people?

02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:05.960
[Amit Varma]: You've reached a new level but

02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:07.960
[Amit Varma]: essentially you are the same.

02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:09.960
[Amit Varma]: You also love cricket, you also play cricket.

02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:11.960
[Guest 2]: So, after my experience

02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:13.960
[Guest 2]: with Sunny and when your

02:49:13.960 --> 02:49:15.960
[Guest 2]: idol lets you down

02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:17.960
[Guest 2]: what happens is that

02:49:17.960 --> 02:49:19.960
[Guest 2]: you create a philosophy

02:49:19.960 --> 02:49:21.960
[Guest 2]: for yourself saying that never meet

02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:23.960
[Guest 2]: your idols. Because let them

02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:25.960
[Guest 2]: be there, just admire

02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:27.960
[Guest 2]: them because when you know them as a person

02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:29.960
[Guest 2]: you kind of get a little

02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:31.960
[Guest 2]: defeated by this entire

02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:33.960
[Guest 2]: experience. And that happened with Sunny

02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:35.960
[Guest 2]: but life

02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:37.960
[Guest 2]: was good. Then came Sachin Tendulkar

02:49:37.960 --> 02:49:39.960
[Guest 2]: who probably is one of the finest human

02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:41.960
[Guest 2]: beings that I met in this

02:49:41.960 --> 02:49:43.960
[Guest 2]: especially in this cricketing zone.

02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:45.960
[Guest 2]: The most secure and we were

02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:47.960
[Guest 2]: very lucky that we

02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:49.960
[Guest 2]: toured at a time when

02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:51.960
[Guest 2]: there are too many good people in one team.

02:49:51.960 --> 02:49:53.960
[Guest 2]: See, whatever said and done

02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:55.960
[Guest 2]: I don't think, it's like in one of your

02:49:55.960 --> 02:49:57.960
[Guest 2]: episodes, one of the speakers says that

02:49:57.960 --> 02:49:59.960
[Guest 2]: there is SD Burman, there is Naushad,

02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:01.960
[Guest 2]: there is Madan Mohan, there is Shankar

02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:03.960
[Guest 2]: Jayakishan. This is a time of

02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:05.960
[Guest 2]: music that can never be replicated

02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:07.960
[Guest 2]: again. I think Tendulkar,

02:50:07.960 --> 02:50:09.960
[Guest 2]: Dravid, Lakshman, Sehwag,

02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:11.960
[Guest 2]: Kumble

02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:13.960
[Guest 2]: it's very difficult to get this kind of

02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:15.960
[Guest 2]: people in the same team and

02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:17.960
[Guest 2]: I was lucky that all these people were

02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:19.960
[Guest 2]: very secure.

02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:21.960
[Guest 2]: Thankfully, they first became

02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:23.960
[Guest 2]: my fan.

02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:25.960
[Guest 2]: And they realized I was more than a fan.

02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:27.960
[Guest 2]: And I think this

02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:29.960
[Guest 2]: transition of being more than a fan

02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:31.960
[Guest 2]: is when you get into the inner circle

02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:33.960
[Guest 2]: of cricketers. When they realize

02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:35.960
[Guest 2]: that boss this guy is not there

02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:37.960
[Guest 2]: as a threat, he is genuinely

02:50:37.960 --> 02:50:39.960
[Guest 2]: interested in the game, he is making me

02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:41.960
[Guest 2]: laugh also and he is asking me

02:50:41.960 --> 02:50:43.960
[Guest 2]: questions that are not

02:50:43.960 --> 02:50:45.960
[Guest 2]: journalistic.

02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:47.960
[Guest 2]: How do you feel?

02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:49.960
[Guest 2]: When I am talking of Anil Kumble

02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:51.960
[Guest 2]: I am saying that

02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:53.960
[Guest 2]: when did you realize that

02:50:53.960 --> 02:50:55.960
[Guest 2]: the LBW

02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:57.960
[Guest 2]: decision is going to be the biggest decision

02:50:57.960 --> 02:50:59.960
[Guest 2]: for you in your life because you are a leg spinner

02:50:59.960 --> 02:51:01.960
[Guest 2]: typically only when you

02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:03.960
[Guest 2]: bowl a googly it will get you an LBW

02:51:03.960 --> 02:51:05.960
[Guest 2]: and he said let me tell you how I did it.

02:51:05.960 --> 02:51:07.960
[Guest 2]: And this is also a very funny

02:51:07.960 --> 02:51:09.960
[Guest 2]: story. You can prompt me when you

02:51:09.960 --> 02:51:11.960
[Guest 2]: want me to tell this story. You can tell the story now.

02:51:11.960 --> 02:51:13.960
[Guest 2]: So it's a fascinating

02:51:13.960 --> 02:51:15.960
[Guest 2]: story and I asked Anil bhai this

02:51:15.960 --> 02:51:17.960
[Guest 2]: question and said that

02:51:17.960 --> 02:51:19.960
[Guest 2]: how do you get a LBW

02:51:19.960 --> 02:51:21.960
[Guest 2]: decision especially when you

02:51:21.960 --> 02:51:23.960
[Guest 2]: got it so often. He said Vikram, the

02:51:23.960 --> 02:51:25.960
[Guest 2]: biggest thing in life that I had to do

02:51:25.960 --> 02:51:27.960
[Guest 2]: is to convince the umpire that I was not

02:51:27.960 --> 02:51:29.960
[Unknown]: a leg spinner.

02:51:29.960 --> 02:51:31.960
[Guest 2]: So he said most people

02:51:31.960 --> 02:51:33.960
[Guest 2]: perceive me as a leg spinner and

02:51:33.960 --> 02:51:35.960
[Guest 2]: that's why they would never give me

02:51:35.960 --> 02:51:37.960
[Guest 2]: an LBW decision because

02:51:37.960 --> 02:51:39.960
[Guest 2]: for a leg spinner the ball is pitched middle and off, it's going

02:51:39.960 --> 02:51:41.960
[Guest 2]: outside and spinners anyway

02:51:41.960 --> 02:51:43.960
[Guest 2]: in that time when he started bowling you

02:51:43.960 --> 02:51:45.960
[Guest 2]: put the front foot out, you were not given

02:51:45.960 --> 02:51:47.960
[Guest 2]: I mean if you look at today's generation

02:51:47.960 --> 02:51:49.960
[Guest 2]: probably Gavaskar, Vengsarkar,

02:51:49.960 --> 02:51:51.960
[Guest 2]: Javed Miyadad were out 10,000

02:51:51.960 --> 02:51:53.960
[Guest 2]: times because there was

02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:55.960
[Guest 2]: no concept of deliberate padding right now

02:51:55.960 --> 02:51:57.960
[Guest 2]: they used to pad their life through the entire test

02:51:57.960 --> 02:51:59.960
[Guest 2]: match but that had stopped

02:51:59.960 --> 02:52:01.960
[Guest 2]: so Anil said that there was this

02:52:01.960 --> 02:52:03.960
[Guest 2]: umpire, South

02:52:03.960 --> 02:52:05.960
[Guest 2]: African umpire who

02:52:05.960 --> 02:52:07.960
[Guest 2]: in the West Indies I had to

02:52:07.960 --> 02:52:09.960
[Guest 2]: convince him that hey you got

02:52:09.960 --> 02:52:11.960
[Guest 2]: to give me an LBW decision but how

02:52:11.960 --> 02:52:13.960
[Guest 2]: do I do that? So he said there

02:52:13.960 --> 02:52:15.960
[Guest 2]: was net practice, Mohammad Kaif was batting

02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:17.960
[Guest 2]: and he said I told Kaif

02:52:17.960 --> 02:52:21.960
[Guest 2]: that I will call Brian Juerling

02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:23.960
[Guest 2]: you don't play him

02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:25.960
[Guest 2]: and let him bat on the pad

02:52:25.960 --> 02:52:27.960
[Guest 2]: so practice sessions happening

02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:29.960
[Guest 2]: he says Brian why don't you come and

02:52:29.960 --> 02:52:31.960
[Guest 2]: do a little bit of umpiring in the nets

02:52:31.960 --> 02:52:33.960
[Guest 2]: and Anil said I started

02:52:33.960 --> 02:52:35.960
[Guest 2]: bowling to Kaif, Kaif would not play

02:52:35.960 --> 02:52:37.960
[Guest 2]: the shot, I said to Brian

02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:39.960
[Guest 2]: Juerling how was that?

02:52:39.960 --> 02:52:41.960
[Guest 2]: Yeah looks close

02:52:41.960 --> 02:52:43.960
[Guest 2]: second ball again he bowls

02:52:43.960 --> 02:52:45.960
[Guest 2]: Brian how was that? Yeah looks close

02:52:45.960 --> 02:52:47.960
[Guest 2]: Anil said that's what I want to tell you

02:52:47.960 --> 02:52:49.960
[Guest 2]: I don't get the leg spinner

02:52:49.960 --> 02:52:51.960
[Guest 2]: going, it's the straighter one that matters

02:52:51.960 --> 02:52:53.960
[Guest 2]: he said I had left that thought with Brian

02:52:53.960 --> 02:52:55.960
[Guest 2]: Juerling, next day he gave me

02:52:55.960 --> 02:52:57.960
[Guest 2]: 4 LBWs

02:52:59.960 --> 02:53:01.960
[Guest 2]: So the fact that I had asked

02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:03.960
[Guest 2]: the right question to Anil Kumble

02:53:03.960 --> 02:53:05.960
[Guest 2]: gave me a great story about how

02:53:05.960 --> 02:53:07.960
[Guest 2]: a bowler thought

02:53:07.960 --> 02:53:09.960
[Guest 2]: through and realized that if he had to get

02:53:09.960 --> 02:53:11.960
[Guest 2]: LBWs he had to make the

02:53:11.960 --> 02:53:13.960
[Guest 2]: umpire believe that he doesn't spin the ball

02:53:13.960 --> 02:53:15.960
[Guest 1]: it's also I think somewhere

02:53:15.960 --> 02:53:17.960
[Guest 1]: again it's the knowledge

02:53:17.960 --> 02:53:19.960
[Guest 1]: I find that, I believe that the teleprompter

02:53:19.960 --> 02:53:21.960
[Guest 1]: was the death of the true host

02:53:21.960 --> 02:53:23.960
[Guest 1]: because the true anchor

02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:25.960
[Guest 1]: had all that

02:53:25.960 --> 02:53:27.960
[Guest 1]: reservoir of knowledge, they knew

02:53:27.960 --> 02:53:29.960
[Guest 1]: what to pick when, Sathe doesn't use

02:53:29.960 --> 02:53:31.960
[Guest 1]: a teleprompter, I see comedians use teleprompters

02:53:31.960 --> 02:53:33.960
[Guest 1]: I see actors trying

02:53:33.960 --> 02:53:35.960
[Guest 1]: to tell jokes as anchors

02:53:35.960 --> 02:53:37.960
[Guest 1]: of very very big television shows or

02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:39.960
[Guest 1]: big stadium shows, every line

02:53:39.960 --> 02:53:41.960
[Guest 1]: is up there then where's the joy

02:53:41.960 --> 02:53:43.960
[Guest 1]: of what you do, where's the joy

02:53:43.960 --> 02:53:45.960
[Guest 1]: of choice, where's the joy of this

02:53:45.960 --> 02:53:47.960
[Guest 1]: will get that reaction and it is because

02:53:47.960 --> 02:53:49.960
[Guest 1]: of his reservoir of knowledge

02:53:49.960 --> 02:53:51.960
[Guest 1]: that he can again be

02:53:51.960 --> 02:53:53.960
[Guest 1]: interesting and interested

02:53:53.960 --> 02:53:55.960
[Guest 1]: in a manner which is not

02:53:55.960 --> 02:53:57.960
[Guest 1]: it's the, I don't know whether when we had spoken

02:53:57.960 --> 02:53:59.960
[Guest 1]: last time I had spoken about that Mr. Bachchan

02:53:59.960 --> 02:54:01.960
[Guest 1]: interview which was the first thing that I had to

02:54:01.960 --> 02:54:03.960
[Guest 1]: do on TV and it was just that I could have just

02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:05.960
[Guest 1]: been a fanboy, I was a fanboy but

02:54:05.960 --> 02:54:07.960
[Guest 1]: I did my research, I did my homework

02:54:07.960 --> 02:54:09.960
[Guest 1]: and so when I go in and I say

02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:11.960
[Guest 1]: you know what does it feel like to be the

02:54:11.960 --> 02:54:13.960
[Guest 1]: man whose voice brings the country to a stop

02:54:13.960 --> 02:54:15.960
[Guest 1]: and be the person who was

02:54:15.960 --> 02:54:17.960
[Guest 1]: rejected by All India Radio, everybody is asking

02:54:17.960 --> 02:54:19.960
[Unknown]: how do you feel about Mithu Tatam, how do you feel about Mithu Tatam acting

02:54:19.960 --> 02:54:21.960
[Guest 1]: how do you feel about working with Madhuri Dixit

02:54:21.960 --> 02:54:23.960
[Guest 1]: he's heard that, there is a level

02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:25.960
[Guest 1]: of numbness that sets in

02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:27.960
[Guest 1]: with the predictability that people do

02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:29.960
[Guest 1]: it is the googly that we can

02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:31.960
[Guest 1]: throw that makes the difference

02:54:31.960 --> 02:54:33.960
[Guest 1]: so often and that really comes

02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:35.960
[Guest 1]: I mean what people love, there are so many of your

02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:37.960
[Guest 1]: interviews where I have seen people

02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:39.960
[Guest 1]: warm up to say oh you did your

02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:41.960
[Guest 1]: research, haven't you seen

02:54:41.960 --> 02:54:43.960
[Guest 1]: mostly a lot of people I think

02:54:43.960 --> 02:54:45.960
[Guest 1]: would be cantankerous at times on your show

02:54:45.960 --> 02:54:47.960
[Guest 1]: but they just warm up to the fact of

02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:49.960
[Guest 1]: you have given me this much respect

02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:51.960
[Guest 1]: you have shown so much interest

02:54:51.960 --> 02:54:53.960
[Guest 1]: and this is something which is a

02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:55.960
[Guest 1]: commodity, I am telling you the number of

02:54:55.960 --> 02:54:57.960
[Guest 1]: there was a person who called me on their podcast and whatever

02:54:57.960 --> 02:54:59.960
[Guest 1]: he read out my resume

02:54:59.960 --> 02:55:01.960
[Guest 1]: and made every third line a question

02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:03.960
[Guest 1]: and I was just so upset

02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:05.960
[Guest 1]: I said you read a LinkedIn profile

02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:07.960
[Guest 1]: and made me waste an hour

02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:09.960
[Guest 1]: and after 5 minutes I started

02:55:09.960 --> 02:55:11.960
[Guest 1]: leading him saying okay you are not

02:55:11.960 --> 02:55:13.960
[Guest 1]: going to go there, I will take you where I want to

02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:15.960
[Guest 1]: but I don't want to waste my hour, but it's just that

02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:17.960
[Guest 1]: that people, I just feel that

02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:19.960
[Guest 1]: that celebration

02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:21.960
[Guest 1]: of research, of depth

02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:23.960
[Guest 1]: is, what you say

02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:25.960
[Guest 1]: about radio, that radio is shallow and white

02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:27.960
[Guest 1]: right, because they

02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:29.960
[Guest 1]: have to tell in the morning what happened

02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:31.960
[Guest 1]: and they have to do this and that

02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:33.960
[Guest 1]: and then there will be a commercial break and 12 songs

02:55:33.960 --> 02:55:35.960
[Guest 1]: have to go and talk for 3 minutes

02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:37.960
[Guest 1]: you are free to do what you want

02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:39.960
[Guest 1]: and I think Sathe is best

02:55:39.960 --> 02:55:41.960
[Guest 1]: when he is free to do what he really really

02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:43.960
[Guest 1]: wants and in these interviews etc

02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:45.960
[Guest 1]: where he is really, really

02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:47.960
[Guest 1]: he just comes out so beautifully when you

02:55:47.960 --> 02:55:49.960
[Guest 1]: see those episodes and stuff

02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:51.960
[Guest 1]: and I really

02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:53.960
[Guest 1]: think he should be doing a lot more of it

02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:55.960
[Guest 1]: I am sorry by the end of it I think I will take you to bed

02:55:55.960 --> 02:55:57.960
[Guest 2]: let's go to the studio, let's do it now

02:55:57.960 --> 02:55:59.960
[Guest 2]: coming back to the point that you made and why I want

02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:01.960
[Guest 1]: to bring it up, the loneliness bit also

02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:03.960
[Guest 2]: loneliness at the top, I think this is an

02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:05.960
[Guest 2]: overrated thing, it is the

02:56:05.960 --> 02:56:07.960
[Guest 2]: problem of the person who

02:56:07.960 --> 02:56:09.960
[Guest 2]: goes to the top that also creates the loneliness

02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:11.960
[Guest 2]: and I have seen that

02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:13.960
[Guest 2]: with Tendulkar, the friends that he has

02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:15.960
[Guest 2]: and he has a lot of friends

02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:17.960
[Guest 2]: he has a lot of groups and they have

02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:19.960
[Guest 2]: remained faithful not only

02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:21.960
[Guest 2]: because he is Tendulkar, it's because of

02:56:21.960 --> 02:56:23.960
[Guest 2]: the effort that Tendulkar and his wife have put

02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:25.960
[Guest 2]: in those relationships as well, so you

02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:27.960
[Guest 2]: will be lonely at the top because you have

02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:29.960
[Guest 2]: also chosen to be lonely at the top

02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:31.960
[Guest 2]: and it so happens that people who go to the top

02:56:31.960 --> 02:56:33.960
[Guest 2]: automatically form an impression of people

02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:35.960
[Guest 2]: down below saying that

02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:37.960
[Guest 2]: they are fan level and stuff like that

02:56:37.960 --> 02:56:39.960
[Guest 2]: they won't resonate with me

02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:41.960
[Guest 2]: but in human relations, not everyone is intellectual

02:56:41.960 --> 02:56:43.960
[Guest 2]: not everyone plays cricket

02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:45.960
[Guest 2]: you and him were friends

02:56:45.960 --> 02:56:47.960
[Guest 2]: Tendulkar's every friend from Sahitya Sawas

02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:49.960
[Guest 2]: is in touch with him

02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:51.960
[Guest 2]: even when he was playing he was on message

02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:53.960
[Guest 2]: with all the Sahitya Sawas, the Mumbai Cricket Gang

02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:55.960
[Guest 2]: and therefore this

02:56:55.960 --> 02:56:57.960
[Guest 2]: proximity to him made me realize that

02:56:57.960 --> 02:56:59.960
[Guest 2]: this loneliness at the top is a choice

02:56:59.960 --> 02:57:01.960
[Guest 2]: that you make also

02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:03.960
[Guest 2]: I mean there are people in your

02:57:03.960 --> 02:57:05.960
[Guest 2]: I mean I have spoken to a lot of people

02:57:05.960 --> 02:57:07.960
[Guest 2]: at the top and they have said that

02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:13.960
[Guest 2]: and I have had this argument with these people

02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:31.960
[Guest 2]: that every human being wants to fit his cup

02:57:31.960 --> 02:57:33.960
[Guest 2]: because the moment you become a celebrity

02:57:33.960 --> 02:57:35.960
[Guest 2]: your friend also gets a little scared

02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:37.960
[Guest 2]: of reaching out to you

02:57:37.960 --> 02:57:39.960
[Guest 2]: but if he reaches out to you, have you tried to reach out

02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:41.960
[Guest 2]: to him again? No you haven't

02:57:41.960 --> 02:57:43.960
[Guest 2]: because you become a top guy

02:57:43.960 --> 02:57:45.960
[Guest 2]: and you want to now hobnob with all

02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:47.960
[Guest 2]: the people who are in that zone

02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:49.960
[Guest 2]: you are lonely because you are hobnobing with them

02:57:49.960 --> 02:57:51.960
[Guest 2]: and

02:57:51.960 --> 02:57:53.960
[Guest 2]: which I have always mentioned to all my creative

02:57:53.960 --> 02:57:55.960
[Guest 2]: people and they say you know Mumbai is such

02:57:55.960 --> 02:57:57.960
[Guest 2]: a lonely place and this place

02:57:57.960 --> 02:57:59.960
[Guest 2]: and that place, I said the problem

02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:01.960
[Guest 2]: is that you are looking at transactional relationships

02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:03.960
[Guest 2]: if you are looking for friendships

02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:05.960
[Guest 2]: in your office which are based

02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:07.960
[Guest 2]: on a fundamental of transaction

02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:09.960
[Guest 2]: or for that matter if the business community

02:58:09.960 --> 02:58:11.960
[Guest 2]: itself, Roshan is meeting 6 clients

02:58:11.960 --> 02:58:13.960
[Guest 2]: and he is now one of the clients

02:58:13.960 --> 02:58:15.960
[Guest 2]: doesn't reply to his call when he is not

02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:17.960
[Guest 2]: feeling well and say this is such a lonely

02:58:17.960 --> 02:58:19.960
[Guest 2]: world

02:58:19.960 --> 02:58:21.960
[Guest 2]: because in Roshan's mind he is my new friend

02:58:21.960 --> 02:58:23.960
[Guest 2]: I drank with him 6 times

02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:25.960
[Guest 2]: but he was not your friend

02:58:25.960 --> 02:58:27.960
[Guest 2]: so you have started expecting from him

02:58:27.960 --> 02:58:29.960
[Guest 2]: and people who go to the top

02:58:29.960 --> 02:58:31.960
[Guest 2]: now want those top people

02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:33.960
[Guest 2]: to start giving him unconditional love

02:58:33.960 --> 02:58:35.960
[Guest 2]: like what his friends did when he was young

02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:37.960
[Guest 2]: that is a wrong play

02:58:37.960 --> 02:58:39.960
[Guest 2]: and I do believe that

02:58:39.960 --> 02:58:41.960
[Guest 2]: if you in that journey of going to the

02:58:41.960 --> 02:58:43.960
[Guest 2]: top are going to forget the people who were

02:58:43.960 --> 02:58:45.960
[Guest 2]: with you during that process because

02:58:45.960 --> 02:58:47.960
[Guest 2]: they are now down market and you are

02:58:47.960 --> 02:58:49.960
[Guest 2]: up market now, that is when loneliness

02:58:49.960 --> 02:58:51.960
[Guest 2]: at the top happens

02:58:51.960 --> 02:58:53.960
[Guest 2]: many people I have seen have managed

02:58:53.960 --> 02:58:55.960
[Guest 2]: this because they have just remained

02:58:55.960 --> 02:58:57.960
[Guest 2]: normal and Sachin is a great example

02:58:57.960 --> 02:58:59.960
[Guest 2]: because he became a prince at 14 and 16

02:58:59.960 --> 02:59:01.960
[Guest 2]: so there can't be a bigger

02:59:01.960 --> 02:59:03.960
[Guest 2]: celebrity in India during that

02:59:03.960 --> 02:59:05.960
[Guest 2]: 24 years and he

02:59:05.960 --> 02:59:07.960
[Guest 2]: is in conversation with all the

02:59:07.960 --> 02:59:09.960
[Guest 2]: people that he played with

02:59:09.960 --> 02:59:11.960
[Guest 2]: in his early years

02:59:11.960 --> 02:59:13.960
[Guest 2]: so I think that it is to do

02:59:13.960 --> 02:59:17.960
[Guest 2]: a lot with your perspective

02:59:17.960 --> 02:59:19.960
[Guest 2]: after you get to the top as well

02:59:19.960 --> 02:59:21.960
[Guest 2]: and I have seen a lot of people fail at that level

02:59:21.960 --> 02:59:23.960
[Guest 1]: also a lot to do with

02:59:23.960 --> 02:59:25.960
[Guest 1]: what world

02:59:25.960 --> 02:59:27.960
[Guest 1]: you choose to participate in

02:59:27.960 --> 02:59:29.960
[Guest 1]: so Smita Sen had become

02:59:29.960 --> 02:59:31.960
[Guest 1]: Miss Universe

02:59:31.960 --> 02:59:33.960
[Guest 1]: and then she came and

02:59:33.960 --> 02:59:35.960
[Guest 1]: she was Epson's brand ambassador, we were doing a big show

02:59:35.960 --> 02:59:37.960
[Guest 1]: when she was 18 I had done

02:59:37.960 --> 02:59:39.960
[Guest 1]: something with her as a fashion show in Lucknow

02:59:39.960 --> 02:59:41.960
[Guest 1]: which I had hosted over there and I went backstage

02:59:41.960 --> 02:59:43.960
[Guest 1]: and for the same TV show I used to do with actors

02:59:43.960 --> 02:59:45.960
[Guest 1]: I was backstage and I turned to her

02:59:45.960 --> 02:59:47.960
[Guest 1]: and said Sushmita how does it feel like to be in Bombay

02:59:47.960 --> 02:59:49.960
[Guest 1]: and now you are part of the film industry

02:59:49.960 --> 02:59:51.960
[Guest 1]: and she loves shero shairi

02:59:51.960 --> 02:59:53.960
[Guest 1]: and she just turned and said

02:59:53.960 --> 02:59:55.960
[Guest 1]: koi haath bhi na milayega jo gale miloge tapak se

02:59:55.960 --> 02:59:57.960
[Guest 1]: yeh naye mijaaz ka shehar hai

02:59:57.960 --> 02:59:59.960
[Guest 1]: zara faasle se mila karo

02:59:59.960 --> 03:00:01.960
[Guest 1]: right

03:00:01.960 --> 03:00:03.960
[Guest 1]: so there are very clear

03:00:03.960 --> 03:00:05.960
[Guest 1]: cut in this big

03:00:05.960 --> 03:00:07.960
[Guest 1]: commercial glamour world of

03:00:07.960 --> 03:00:09.960
[Guest 1]: Bollywood and film and all of this etc

03:00:09.960 --> 03:00:11.960
[Guest 1]: and success at this level

03:00:11.960 --> 03:00:13.960
[Guest 1]: with all the awards and all the A-list that we have

03:00:13.960 --> 03:00:15.960
[Guest 1]: there is a lot of these things that people

03:00:15.960 --> 03:00:17.960
[Guest 1]: have to do, there is a machinery

03:00:17.960 --> 03:00:19.960
[Guest 1]: the machinery around a star today sometimes

03:00:19.960 --> 03:00:21.960
[Guest 1]: if a star does a show for you for free

03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:23.960
[Guest 1]: I had a very dear friend of mine who was doing one

03:00:23.960 --> 03:00:25.960
[Guest 1]: Kukri show and something and she invited some

03:00:25.960 --> 03:00:27.960
[Guest 1]: very big celebrity who was a friend of hers

03:00:27.960 --> 03:00:29.960
[Guest 1]: who used to be at her house and whatever

03:00:29.960 --> 03:00:31.960
[Guest 1]: and she said that you know

03:00:31.960 --> 03:00:33.960
[Guest 1]: of course I won't charge you and came

03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:35.960
[Guest 1]: the entourage cost

03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:37.960
[Guest 1]: was so more than the cost of the show

03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:39.960
[Guest 1]: I am sorry I can't afford these people

03:00:39.960 --> 03:00:41.960
[Guest 1]: so people build these

03:00:41.960 --> 03:00:43.960
[Guest 1]: machineries around themselves

03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:45.960
[Guest 1]: and this becomes

03:00:45.960 --> 03:00:47.960
[Guest 1]: more and more lonely because

03:00:47.960 --> 03:00:49.960
[Guest 1]: even this set of people keeps people away

03:00:49.960 --> 03:00:51.960
[Guest 1]: very often there is a set of people

03:00:51.960 --> 03:00:53.960
[Guest 1]: who now feel that because they have

03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:55.960
[Guest 1]: access and access means money

03:00:55.960 --> 03:00:57.960
[Guest 1]: access means power, they will

03:00:57.960 --> 03:00:59.960
[Guest 1]: take off the access of everyone else

03:00:59.960 --> 03:01:01.960
[Guest 1]: there was a newspaper

03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:03.960
[Guest 1]: a TV journalist when Jeena Icy Ka Naam

03:01:03.960 --> 03:01:05.960
[Guest 1]: used to happen and a friend of mine was working

03:01:05.960 --> 03:01:07.960
[Guest 1]: on the show as a producer and

03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:09.960
[Guest 1]: Akshay was in fact doing that episode and

03:01:09.960 --> 03:01:11.960
[Guest 1]: the person who had coordinated

03:01:11.960 --> 03:01:13.960
[Guest 1]: the interview, this journalist

03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:15.960
[Guest 1]: said that Akshay is not coming just now

03:01:15.960 --> 03:01:17.960
[Guest 1]: and whatever

03:01:17.960 --> 03:01:19.960
[Guest 1]: so the producer got very upset

03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:21.960
[Guest 1]: saying what happened?

03:01:21.960 --> 03:01:23.960
[Guest 1]: won't come, won't come

03:01:23.960 --> 03:01:25.960
[Guest 1]: so after about an hour of saying the person still

03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:27.960
[Guest 1]: not coming or blah blah blah this producer

03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:29.960
[Guest 1]: went opened the vanity van door and said I am just

03:01:29.960 --> 03:01:31.960
[Guest 1]: walking in and sitting inside

03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:33.960
[Guest 1]: was Akshay saying that when are we starting

03:01:33.960 --> 03:01:35.960
[Guest 1]: she said we have been ready

03:01:35.960 --> 03:01:37.960
[Guest 1]: for the last hour, no one told me

03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:39.960
[Guest 1]: right

03:01:39.960 --> 03:01:41.960
[Guest 1]: and then the famous

03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:43.960
[Guest 1]: statement again and sometimes people say this

03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:45.960
[Guest 1]: when I was trying to cast him off

03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:47.960
[Guest 1]: I couldn't get access because I was being blocked

03:01:47.960 --> 03:01:49.960
[Guest 1]: and he turned and said Roshan this city

03:01:49.960 --> 03:01:51.960
[Guest 1]: is such that sometimes

03:01:51.960 --> 03:01:53.960
[Guest 1]: more than tea

03:01:53.960 --> 03:01:55.960
[Guest 1]: the plate gets hot

03:01:55.960 --> 03:01:57.960
[Guest 1]: right so people

03:01:57.960 --> 03:01:59.960
[Guest 1]: build these things, they build this

03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:01.960
[Guest 2]: area

03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:03.960
[Guest 2]: see this emotional thing

03:02:03.960 --> 03:02:05.960
[Guest 2]: gets glamorized

03:02:05.960 --> 03:02:07.960
[Guest 2]: but it is not like that because I tell a lot of

03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:09.960
[Guest 2]: young cricketers that

03:02:09.960 --> 03:02:11.960
[Guest 2]: your journey

03:02:11.960 --> 03:02:13.960
[Guest 2]: you have reached from here to here

03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:15.960
[Guest 2]: your job is to make a relationship

03:02:15.960 --> 03:02:17.960
[Guest 2]: this is not the job of people

03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:19.960
[Guest 2]: and if you don't make an effort to make a relationship

03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:21.960
[Guest 2]: then the people

03:02:21.960 --> 03:02:23.960
[Guest 2]: around you will become your friends

03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:25.960
[Guest 2]: that is a wrong premise

03:02:25.960 --> 03:02:27.960
[Guest 2]: the people around you are your

03:02:27.960 --> 03:02:29.960
[Guest 2]: protective cover, they are not your friends

03:02:29.960 --> 03:02:31.960
[Guest 2]: but they will

03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:33.960
[Guest 2]: stop you from calling your friends

03:02:33.960 --> 03:02:35.960
[Guest 2]: you should understand

03:02:35.960 --> 03:02:37.960
[Guest 1]: that friends are important for you

03:02:37.960 --> 03:02:39.960
[Guest 1]: and which world do you choose, like you said

03:02:39.960 --> 03:02:41.960
[Guest 1]: high babes world or

03:02:41.960 --> 03:02:43.960
[Guest 2]: I am happy doing my art concert

03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:45.960
[Guest 2]: choose both but

03:02:45.960 --> 03:02:47.960
[Guest 2]: your onus is to call

03:02:47.960 --> 03:02:49.960
[Guest 2]: you have grown up

03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:51.960
[Guest 2]: no matter how much you

03:02:51.960 --> 03:02:53.960
[Guest 2]: shirk the responsibility

03:02:53.960 --> 03:02:55.960
[Guest 2]: it is so lonely at the top

03:02:55.960 --> 03:02:57.960
[Guest 2]: it is all fake relationship

03:02:57.960 --> 03:02:59.960
[Guest 2]: how much have you tried?

03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:01.960
[Guest 2]: because I have become important

03:03:01.960 --> 03:03:03.960
[Guest 2]: I don't call people, people have to call me

03:03:03.960 --> 03:03:05.960
[Guest 2]: I think I have seen that with a lot of young cricketers

03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:07.960
[Guest 2]: also that the moment they

03:03:07.960 --> 03:03:09.960
[Guest 2]: leave their small town and come into

03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:11.960
[Guest 2]: this world where everybody is

03:03:11.960 --> 03:03:13.960
[Guest 2]: they are also looking at

03:03:13.960 --> 03:03:15.960
[Guest 2]: if I meet Vikram Sathe, he will do a sponsorship deal

03:03:15.960 --> 03:03:17.960
[Guest 2]: if I come to his show, I will have 10 followers

03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:19.960
[Guest 2]: and I will get a city bank deal

03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:21.960
[Guest 2]: if your lens becomes like this

03:03:21.960 --> 03:03:23.960
[Guest 2]: then that guy in the village becomes

03:03:23.960 --> 03:03:25.960
[Amit Varma]: immaterial. So I have a follow up question

03:03:25.960 --> 03:03:27.960
[Amit Varma]: two angles to it, one is

03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:29.960
[Amit Varma]: I had done an episode with Harsha Bhogle

03:03:29.960 --> 03:03:31.960
[Unknown]: a long long time back, it was a very short episode

03:03:31.960 --> 03:03:33.960
[Unknown]: it was just an hour

03:03:33.960 --> 03:03:35.960
[Amit Varma]: but one interesting point he made there

03:03:35.960 --> 03:03:37.960
[Amit Varma]: was that that generation

03:03:37.960 --> 03:03:39.960
[Amit Varma]: which you spoke of, Sachin, Ravid,

03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:41.960
[Amit Varma]: Kumle, all of those guys, they had a solid

03:03:41.960 --> 03:03:43.960
[Amit Varma]: middle class background with middle class values

03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:45.960
[Amit Varma]: which he said played a part in making them

03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:47.960
[Amit Varma]: who they are. For example,

03:03:47.960 --> 03:03:49.960
[Amit Varma]: you know my speculation about all the great Pakistan

03:03:49.960 --> 03:03:51.960
[Amit Varma]: talent that used to come up

03:03:51.960 --> 03:03:53.960
[Amit Varma]: like every year there would be a new 19

03:03:53.960 --> 03:03:55.960
[Amit Varma]: year old blazing his way

03:03:55.960 --> 03:03:57.960
[Amit Varma]: forward and in one year he would just be gone

03:03:57.960 --> 03:03:59.960
[Amit Varma]: and one possible factor for that

03:03:59.960 --> 03:04:01.960
[Amit Varma]: was that there was at that time

03:04:01.960 --> 03:04:03.960
[Amit Varma]: I don't know about now, at that time, no real middle class

03:04:03.960 --> 03:04:05.960
[Amit Varma]: in Pakistan. So many of these would be

03:04:05.960 --> 03:04:07.960
[Amit Varma]: small town kids who have come up and who simply

03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:09.960
[Amit Varma]: cannot handle the fame and the money

03:04:09.960 --> 03:04:11.960
[Amit Varma]: and they kind of fall apart

03:04:11.960 --> 03:04:13.960
[Amit Varma]: and what has happened since in Indian

03:04:13.960 --> 03:04:15.960
[Amit Varma]: cricket and it's a damn good thing that it's happened

03:04:15.960 --> 03:04:17.960
[Amit Varma]: that small town India

03:04:17.960 --> 03:04:19.960
[Amit Varma]: has really asserted itself that

03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:21.960
[Amit Varma]: players can come from anywhere, perhaps starting

03:04:21.960 --> 03:04:23.960
[Amit Varma]: with the Dhoni Yuvraj generation

03:04:23.960 --> 03:04:25.960
[Amit Varma]: but small town has kind of taken over

03:04:25.960 --> 03:04:27.960
[Amit Varma]: and you have people from many different backgrounds

03:04:27.960 --> 03:04:29.960
[Amit Varma]: which is wonderful

03:04:29.960 --> 03:04:31.960
[Amit Varma]: but it means that the sort of, you know

03:04:31.960 --> 03:04:33.960
[Amit Varma]: even if Sachin, Ravid, Kumle were

03:04:33.960 --> 03:04:35.960
[Amit Varma]: from different cities

03:04:35.960 --> 03:04:37.960
[Amit Varma]: it was homogenous in terms of those

03:04:37.960 --> 03:04:39.960
[Amit Varma]: middle class values

03:04:39.960 --> 03:04:41.960
[Amit Varma]: which means that you are much more

03:04:41.960 --> 03:04:43.960
[Amit Varma]: settled and you don't

03:04:43.960 --> 03:04:45.960
[Amit Varma]: go through those experiences and the second angle

03:04:45.960 --> 03:04:47.960
[Amit Varma]: is coming to a city, right

03:04:47.960 --> 03:04:49.960
[Amit Varma]: when you speak about Sachin, sure he

03:04:49.960 --> 03:04:51.960
[Amit Varma]: became a big star very early but he was

03:04:51.960 --> 03:04:53.960
[Amit Varma]: already part of what seems

03:04:53.960 --> 03:04:55.960
[Amit Varma]: to me to be part of a really settled

03:04:55.960 --> 03:04:57.960
[Amit Varma]: community that Bandra East

03:04:57.960 --> 03:04:59.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, Saikar, Sivas or whatever

03:04:59.960 --> 03:05:01.960
[Amit Varma]: that community of artists and

03:05:01.960 --> 03:05:03.960
[Amit Varma]: cultured people and whatever and you're part

03:05:03.960 --> 03:05:05.960
[Amit Varma]: of that where nobody gets too big for their boots

03:05:05.960 --> 03:05:07.960
[Amit Varma]: as that, you know, again the classic

03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:09.960
[Amit Varma]: middle class Maharashtrian mentality even if

03:05:09.960 --> 03:05:11.960
[Amit Varma]: in terms of income you break out of that

03:05:11.960 --> 03:05:13.960
[Amit Varma]: and that sense of community is there

03:05:13.960 --> 03:05:15.960
[Amit Varma]: but for a lot of people who

03:05:15.960 --> 03:05:17.960
[Amit Varma]: come to Bombay, including me when I first came

03:05:17.960 --> 03:05:19.960
[Amit Varma]: to Bombay, you are atomized

03:05:19.960 --> 03:05:21.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, there is no community

03:05:21.960 --> 03:05:23.960
[Amit Varma]: everything initially is transactional

03:05:23.960 --> 03:05:25.960
[Amit Varma]: you have no friends, it's atomized

03:05:25.960 --> 03:05:27.960
[Amit Varma]: everything is transactional

03:05:27.960 --> 03:05:29.960
[Amit Varma]: maybe over a period of time you build a community

03:05:29.960 --> 03:05:31.960
[Amit Varma]: of friends, maybe you don't but if

03:05:31.960 --> 03:05:33.960
[Amit Varma]: you've come from a small town somewhere

03:05:33.960 --> 03:05:35.960
[Amit Varma]: and you're thrust into the spotlight like this

03:05:35.960 --> 03:05:37.960
[Amit Varma]: to say that loneliness

03:05:37.960 --> 03:05:39.960
[Amit Varma]: is a choice, I don't think it's completely

03:05:39.960 --> 03:05:41.960
[Amit Varma]: fair in those cases because

03:05:41.960 --> 03:05:43.960
[Amit Varma]: you don't even know, you know, at the one hand

03:05:43.960 --> 03:05:45.960
[Amit Varma]: you might be mixing with the babes, dudes kind

03:05:45.960 --> 03:05:47.960
[Amit Varma]: of thing and saying, I don't belong here

03:05:47.960 --> 03:05:49.960
[Amit Varma]: which is actually a better thing to say to yourself

03:05:49.960 --> 03:05:51.960
[Amit Varma]: than trying artificially to fit in

03:05:51.960 --> 03:05:53.960
[Amit Varma]: and on the other side

03:05:53.960 --> 03:05:55.960
[Amit Varma]: you no longer have any common

03:05:55.960 --> 03:05:57.960
[Amit Varma]: thread that connects you with whoever

03:05:57.960 --> 03:05:59.960
[Amit Varma]: you might have known in your hometown

03:05:59.960 --> 03:06:01.960
[Amit Varma]: back there, it just feels very awkward

03:06:01.960 --> 03:06:03.960
[Amit Varma]: on both sides

03:06:03.960 --> 03:06:05.960
[Guest 2]: and those kind of frames. So there are some

03:06:05.960 --> 03:06:07.960
[Guest 2]: people who do it well, like MS did

03:06:07.960 --> 03:06:09.960
[Guest 2]: it very well. So what they do

03:06:09.960 --> 03:06:11.960
[Guest 2]: is that they involve all

03:06:11.960 --> 03:06:13.960
[Guest 2]: their friends in business

03:06:13.960 --> 03:06:15.960
[Unknown]: in their own company

03:06:15.960 --> 03:06:17.960
[Guest 1]: which is also not the right thing to do

03:06:17.960 --> 03:06:19.960
[Guest 2]: which is not the right thing to do but everybody

03:06:19.960 --> 03:06:21.960
[Guest 2]: see, it's not left or right

03:06:21.960 --> 03:06:23.960
[Guest 2]: it's not right or right, the answer is

03:06:23.960 --> 03:06:25.960
[Guest 2]: somewhere in the center. But they

03:06:25.960 --> 03:06:27.960
[Guest 2]: have tried in such a way that my

03:06:27.960 --> 03:06:29.960
[Guest 2]: 4-5 people who

03:06:29.960 --> 03:06:31.960
[Guest 2]: make me stay in my life

03:06:31.960 --> 03:06:33.960
[Guest 2]: I will involve them because I am

03:06:33.960 --> 03:06:35.960
[Guest 2]: travelling around. So you will always have

03:06:35.960 --> 03:06:37.960
[Guest 2]: some people find a balance with 3-4

03:06:37.960 --> 03:06:39.960
[Guest 2]: people travelling with them or being with them

03:06:39.960 --> 03:06:41.960
[Guest 2]: MS after he

03:06:41.960 --> 03:06:43.960
[Unknown]: finishes his cricket, he is not in

03:06:43.960 --> 03:06:45.960
[Guest 2]: any party, he is in Ranchi with his

03:06:45.960 --> 03:06:47.960
[Guest 2]: friends, in his old this thing

03:06:47.960 --> 03:06:49.960
[Guest 2]: but they are in touch with him regularly

03:06:49.960 --> 03:06:51.960
[Guest 2]: so the fact of the matter is

03:06:51.960 --> 03:06:53.960
[Guest 2]: MS Dhoni is not lonely at all

03:06:53.960 --> 03:06:55.960
[Guest 2]: so people

03:06:55.960 --> 03:06:57.960
[Guest 2]: coming from small towns have

03:06:57.960 --> 03:06:59.960
[Guest 2]: cracked it because Dhoni for whatever it's worth

03:06:59.960 --> 03:07:01.960
[Guest 2]: also is a very smart guy but maybe

03:07:01.960 --> 03:07:03.960
[Guest 2]: you would not have an Umran Malik get this kind

03:07:03.960 --> 03:07:05.960
[Guest 2]: of education, maybe you would not have a

03:07:05.960 --> 03:07:07.960
[Guest 2]: Kuldeep Yadav get this kind of education

03:07:07.960 --> 03:07:09.960
[Guest 2]: but is there a system

03:07:09.960 --> 03:07:11.960
[Guest 2]: which tells a Kuldeep Yadav that

03:07:11.960 --> 03:07:13.960
[Guest 2]: you are on the fast path, don't forget

03:07:13.960 --> 03:07:15.960
[Guest 2]: your friends because

03:07:15.960 --> 03:07:17.960
[Guest 2]: they will keep you on the same level

03:07:17.960 --> 03:07:19.960
[Guest 2]: this has to come in your primary education

03:07:19.960 --> 03:07:21.960
[Guest 2]: or this has to come in your family

03:07:21.960 --> 03:07:23.960
[Guest 2]: value system and those

03:07:23.960 --> 03:07:25.960
[Guest 2]: who are able to crack that

03:07:25.960 --> 03:07:27.960
[Guest 2]: don't suffer loneliness at the

03:07:27.960 --> 03:07:29.960
[Guest 2]: top but if you leave all of that

03:07:29.960 --> 03:07:31.960
[Guest 2]: behind and it's not necessary that they have to travel

03:07:31.960 --> 03:07:33.960
[Guest 2]: with you, there is a phone and you can be in

03:07:33.960 --> 03:07:35.960
[Guest 2]: touch with them and many cricketers do that on a

03:07:35.960 --> 03:07:37.960
[Guest 2]: regular basis but the moment

03:07:37.960 --> 03:07:39.960
[Guest 2]: you try and cross the boundary and

03:07:39.960 --> 03:07:41.960
[Guest 2]: say that I want to be friends with the Juhu boys

03:07:41.960 --> 03:07:43.960
[Guest 2]: or for that matter the Bandra boys

03:07:43.960 --> 03:07:45.960
[Guest 2]: that becomes a problem

03:07:45.960 --> 03:07:47.960
[Guest 2]: okay and

03:07:47.960 --> 03:07:49.960
[Guest 2]: if you keep the balance that

03:07:49.960 --> 03:07:51.960
[Guest 2]: these are important people to know but

03:07:51.960 --> 03:07:53.960
[Guest 2]: I come back to my own point which Dhoni

03:07:53.960 --> 03:07:55.960
[Guest 2]: did beautifully

03:07:55.960 --> 03:07:57.960
[Guest 2]: Dhoni never involves himself in

03:07:57.960 --> 03:07:59.960
[Guest 2]: he doesn't meet big people

03:07:59.960 --> 03:08:01.960
[Guest 2]: he is back to Rachi and

03:08:01.960 --> 03:08:03.960
[Guest 2]: farming, play MS Dhoni

03:08:03.960 --> 03:08:05.960
[Guest 2]: the legend, go back to Rachi

03:08:05.960 --> 03:08:07.960
[Guest 2]: do 5 shoots in Bombay

03:08:07.960 --> 03:08:09.960
[Guest 2]: even for us we know him for

03:08:09.960 --> 03:08:11.960
[Guest 2]: so many years, he will not meet more than once

03:08:11.960 --> 03:08:13.960
[Guest 2]: how are you Vikram bhai?

03:08:13.960 --> 03:08:15.960
[Guest 2]: 3-4 jokes, never will he make an

03:08:15.960 --> 03:08:17.960
[Guest 2]: attempt, he doesn't carry a phone so there is

03:08:17.960 --> 03:08:19.960
[Guest 2]: a great example for somebody who has kept

03:08:19.960 --> 03:08:21.960
[Guest 2]: the balance of being in a

03:08:21.960 --> 03:08:23.960
[Guest 2]: party in Bandra and being in a shoot

03:08:23.960 --> 03:08:25.960
[Guest 2]: go back to his hometown with his 6

03:08:25.960 --> 03:08:27.960
[Guest 2]: friends, so it can be done

03:08:27.960 --> 03:08:29.960
[Guest 2]: only thing is that he is an evolved person

03:08:29.960 --> 03:08:31.960
[Guest 2]: he understood it quickly

03:08:31.960 --> 03:08:33.960
[Guest 2]: small kids may not be able to understand

03:08:33.960 --> 03:08:35.960
[Guest 2]: so how can he be explained

03:08:35.960 --> 03:08:37.960
[Guest 2]: is the challenge but education

03:08:37.960 --> 03:08:39.960
[Guest 2]: has to be done to make them understand

03:08:39.960 --> 03:08:41.960
[Guest 2]: that boss the story is not to find

03:08:41.960 --> 03:08:43.960
[Guest 2]: friendships in transactions

03:08:43.960 --> 03:08:45.960
[Guest 2]: and this is a question I would like to ask you

03:08:45.960 --> 03:08:47.960
[Guest 2]: also that in a city like Mumbai

03:08:47.960 --> 03:08:49.960
[Guest 2]: where everybody has come for a

03:08:49.960 --> 03:08:51.960
[Guest 2]: transaction, to seek friendships

03:08:51.960 --> 03:08:53.960
[Guest 2]: in a pond which is

03:08:53.960 --> 03:08:55.960
[Guest 2]: transactional and then hope

03:08:55.960 --> 03:08:57.960
[Guest 2]: that it will give you unconditional love

03:08:57.960 --> 03:08:59.960
[Guest 2]: is also a challenge

03:08:59.960 --> 03:09:01.960
[Guest 2]: but see that's what I am saying

03:09:01.960 --> 03:09:03.960
[Guest 2]: and I am not saying that nothing can be done

03:09:03.960 --> 03:09:05.960
[Guest 2]: transactional relationship also can be nutritious

03:09:05.960 --> 03:09:07.960
[Guest 1]: but still it is

03:09:07.960 --> 03:09:09.960
[Guest 1]: absolutely, I am just answering

03:09:09.960 --> 03:09:11.960
[Guest 1]: what you are saying

03:09:11.960 --> 03:09:13.960
[Guest 1]: when you come to, if you think

03:09:13.960 --> 03:09:15.960
[Guest 1]: that because this is a city where ok

03:09:15.960 --> 03:09:17.960
[Guest 1]: city of dreams, dreams get fulfilled

03:09:17.960 --> 03:09:19.960
[Guest 1]: head of business and Bollywood both exist here

03:09:19.960 --> 03:09:21.960
[Guest 1]: whatever and therefore you will possibly find

03:09:21.960 --> 03:09:23.960
[Guest 1]: the top layer of

03:09:23.960 --> 03:09:25.960
[Guest 1]: stuff in this

03:09:25.960 --> 03:09:27.960
[Guest 1]: I feel that if you are going to

03:09:27.960 --> 03:09:29.960
[Guest 1]: come here saying this is a city of transactions

03:09:29.960 --> 03:09:31.960
[Guest 1]: then you will make transactional relationships

03:09:31.960 --> 03:09:33.960
[Guest 1]: but if genuinely when I

03:09:33.960 --> 03:09:35.960
[Guest 1]: came to Mumbai, I came to Mumbai chasing

03:09:35.960 --> 03:09:37.960
[Guest 1]: Shaheen because you know she was here

03:09:37.960 --> 03:09:39.960
[Guest 1]: and I was like ok I will get work

03:09:39.960 --> 03:09:41.960
[Guest 1]: I didn't chase opportunity and again

03:09:41.960 --> 03:09:43.960
[Guest 1]: I am not saying that, there are many and I can tell you a lot of

03:09:43.960 --> 03:09:45.960
[Guest 1]: young people today are not like this

03:09:45.960 --> 03:09:47.960
[Guest 1]: they are not, there is a set of people

03:09:47.960 --> 03:09:49.960
[Guest 1]: and I genuinely believe in them

03:09:49.960 --> 03:09:51.960
[Guest 1]: the young creators, I call them this really

03:09:51.960 --> 03:09:53.960
[Guest 1]: the unafraid generation

03:09:53.960 --> 03:09:55.960
[Guest 1]: they are unafraid, I know

03:09:55.960 --> 03:09:57.960
[Guest 1]: the word flawsome, I am

03:09:57.960 --> 03:09:59.960
[Amit Varma]: flawed but I am awesome

03:09:59.960 --> 03:10:01.960
[Amit Varma]: first time I have heard the word, it's a nice word

03:10:01.960 --> 03:10:03.960
[Guest 1]: so I use this very often

03:10:03.960 --> 03:10:05.960
[Guest 1]: so I turn and say this is generation flawsome

03:10:05.960 --> 03:10:07.960
[Guest 1]: they are very happy to own up to this

03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:09.960
[Guest 1]: they are very happy to have conversations

03:10:09.960 --> 03:10:11.960
[Guest 1]: beyond the transaction

03:10:11.960 --> 03:10:13.960
[Guest 1]: and frankly in any relationship

03:10:13.960 --> 03:10:15.960
[Guest 1]: if you and I came and we were

03:10:15.960 --> 03:10:17.960
[Guest 1]: supposed to discuss, Amit can you do this podcast

03:10:17.960 --> 03:10:19.960
[Guest 1]: for me and that is the transaction over

03:10:19.960 --> 03:10:21.960
[Guest 1]: but I have a remaining half an hour

03:10:21.960 --> 03:10:23.960
[Guest 1]: that I want to get to know Amit

03:10:23.960 --> 03:10:25.960
[Guest 1]: and find that there are places of commonality

03:10:25.960 --> 03:10:27.960
[Guest 1]: they will happen

03:10:27.960 --> 03:10:29.960
[Guest 1]: you will find that common

03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:31.960
[Guest 1]: relevant thing that will happen

03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:33.960
[Guest 1]: I made a film, I am not in touch with 89%

03:10:33.960 --> 03:10:35.960
[Guest 1]: of the people there, but there are 10%

03:10:35.960 --> 03:10:37.960
[Guest 1]: people that I am still in touch with, not because of

03:10:37.960 --> 03:10:39.960
[Guest 1]: transaction, but because there was a common

03:10:39.960 --> 03:10:41.960
[Guest 1]: something that we shared

03:10:41.960 --> 03:10:43.960
[Guest 1]: I just did the play Namit Das

03:10:43.960 --> 03:10:45.960
[Guest 1]: I just discovered Namit, what a great singer

03:10:45.960 --> 03:10:47.960
[Guest 1]: what a great performer

03:10:47.960 --> 03:10:49.960
[Guest 1]: one day he was sitting and he started telling me a story that was in his head

03:10:49.960 --> 03:10:51.960
[Guest 1]: loves cricket, has played cricket

03:10:51.960 --> 03:10:53.960
[Guest 1]: now that's there

03:10:53.960 --> 03:10:55.960
[Guest 1]: Sagar Deshmukh is a brilliant

03:10:55.960 --> 03:10:57.960
[Guest 1]: actor from the Marathi stage

03:10:57.960 --> 03:10:59.960
[Guest 1]: played Ambedkar on the television show for 2 years

03:10:59.960 --> 03:11:01.960
[Guest 1]: learned something with him

03:11:01.960 --> 03:11:03.960
[Guest 1]: a new relationship was formed

03:11:03.960 --> 03:11:05.960
[Guest 1]: so what are you looking for

03:11:05.960 --> 03:11:07.960
[Guest 1]: that is it

03:11:07.960 --> 03:11:09.960
[Guest 1]: and I know that sometimes at a young age

03:11:09.960 --> 03:11:11.960
[Guest 1]: you might be wanting this thing of saying

03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:13.960
[Guest 1]: oh I need to quickly reach to the top

03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:15.960
[Guest 1]: fastest transactional path

03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:17.960
[Guest 1]: but genuinely I find a lot of

03:11:17.960 --> 03:11:19.960
[Guest 1]: young people while they are aware of this

03:11:19.960 --> 03:11:21.960
[Guest 1]: suddenly, see

03:11:21.960 --> 03:11:23.960
[Guest 1]: remember what we were taught at that point in time was just work

03:11:23.960 --> 03:11:25.960
[Guest 1]: work work because the time to enjoy will come later

03:11:25.960 --> 03:11:27.960
[Guest 1]: some of us chose not to do that

03:11:27.960 --> 03:11:29.960
[Guest 1]: but I find a lot of the younger lot

03:11:29.960 --> 03:11:31.960
[Guest 1]: because of this whole work

03:11:31.960 --> 03:11:33.960
[Guest 1]: life, you know what is my balance

03:11:33.960 --> 03:11:35.960
[Guest 1]: mental health

03:11:35.960 --> 03:11:37.960
[Guest 1]: breaking down

03:11:37.960 --> 03:11:39.960
[Guest 1]: my daughter is 15

03:11:39.960 --> 03:11:41.960
[Guest 1]: yes I mean fine, my children come from a

03:11:41.960 --> 03:11:43.960
[Guest 1]: privileged background now

03:11:43.960 --> 03:11:45.960
[Guest 1]: but I find them to be

03:11:45.960 --> 03:11:47.960
[Guest 1]: about a lot of these things which

03:11:47.960 --> 03:11:49.960
[Guest 1]: normally I feel

03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:51.960
[Guest 1]: they are happy

03:11:51.960 --> 03:11:53.960
[Guest 1]: enjoying certain aspects of life

03:11:53.960 --> 03:11:55.960
[Guest 1]: gap years have become such a common

03:11:55.960 --> 03:11:57.960
[Guest 1]: thing, earlier gap years used to be a slur

03:11:57.960 --> 03:11:59.960
[Guest 1]: remember, oh my god they took a gap year

03:11:59.960 --> 03:12:01.960
[Guest 1]: now taking a gap year is

03:12:01.960 --> 03:12:03.960
[Guest 1]: like an international thing of I want to go and discover the world

03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:05.960
[Guest 1]: I want to go and find things

03:12:05.960 --> 03:12:07.960
[Guest 1]: being a digital nomad

03:12:07.960 --> 03:12:09.960
[Guest 1]: not wanting to own a house, not wanting to have a car

03:12:09.960 --> 03:12:11.960
[Guest 1]: I think a lot

03:12:11.960 --> 03:12:13.960
[Guest 1]: of this is breaking down

03:12:13.960 --> 03:12:15.960
[Guest 1]: maybe a lot of it has to do with this new generation

03:12:15.960 --> 03:12:17.960
[Guest 1]: and of course we live in a multitude

03:12:17.960 --> 03:12:19.960
[Guest 1]: of India's as well

03:12:19.960 --> 03:12:21.960
[Guest 1]: so when you go to a smaller city it's a very different thing

03:12:21.960 --> 03:12:23.960
[Guest 1]: you go to an industrial

03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:25.960
[Guest 1]: town, people behave very differently

03:12:25.960 --> 03:12:27.960
[Guest 1]: you talk to a business community

03:12:27.960 --> 03:12:29.960
[Guest 1]: but I mean in all of this I am very happy

03:12:29.960 --> 03:12:31.960
[Guest 1]: that I largely exist within the creator subset

03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:33.960
[Guest 1]: and I really find young creators

03:12:33.960 --> 03:12:35.960
[Guest 1]: are now in this

03:12:35.960 --> 03:12:37.960
[Guest 1]: you know, flawsome, honest

03:12:37.960 --> 03:12:39.960
[Guest 1]: space of ownership

03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:41.960
[Amit Varma]: which I personally really love

03:12:41.960 --> 03:12:43.960
[Amit Varma]: so I have a broader question for both of you

03:12:43.960 --> 03:12:45.960
[Amit Varma]: which you know ties in

03:12:45.960 --> 03:12:47.960
[Amit Varma]: different threads of what we were talking about

03:12:47.960 --> 03:12:49.960
[Amit Varma]: like earlier you mentioned Vikram that you were at this

03:12:49.960 --> 03:12:51.960
[Amit Varma]: event where they wanted victory

03:12:51.960 --> 03:12:53.960
[Amit Varma]: they were negotiating, right, how to

03:12:53.960 --> 03:12:55.960
[Amit Varma]: fit Papplu, transactional mindset and so on

03:12:55.960 --> 03:12:57.960
[Amit Varma]: and so forth

03:12:57.960 --> 03:12:59.960
[Amit Varma]: and while a lot of people

03:12:59.960 --> 03:13:01.960
[Amit Varma]: I imagine who would be successful today

03:13:01.960 --> 03:13:03.960
[Amit Varma]: in my mind whenever I meet a successful

03:13:03.960 --> 03:13:05.960
[Amit Varma]: person like Roshan

03:13:05.960 --> 03:13:07.960
[Amit Varma]: I find them to be very humble and open

03:13:07.960 --> 03:13:09.960
[Amit Varma]: completely different from this where their norms are

03:13:09.960 --> 03:13:11.960
[Amit Varma]: that I will be warm, I will be whatever

03:13:11.960 --> 03:13:13.960
[Amit Varma]: and Papplu fit doesn't matter to me

03:13:13.960 --> 03:13:15.960
[Amit Varma]: and it seems

03:13:15.960 --> 03:13:17.960
[Amit Varma]: that there is a difference in norms here

03:13:17.960 --> 03:13:19.960
[Amit Varma]: another place in which there is a difference in norms

03:13:19.960 --> 03:13:21.960
[Amit Varma]: here is the Bollywood example you give

03:13:21.960 --> 03:13:23.960
[Amit Varma]: where the actress tells you that

03:13:23.960 --> 03:13:25.960
[Amit Varma]: I have to throw tantrum on the first day

03:13:25.960 --> 03:13:27.960
[Amit Varma]: because of this

03:13:27.960 --> 03:13:29.960
[Amit Varma]: and they are all responding to

03:13:29.960 --> 03:13:31.960
[Amit Varma]: rational incentives

03:13:31.960 --> 03:13:33.960
[Amit Varma]: she gave you a rational reason, these are the incentives

03:13:33.960 --> 03:13:35.960
[Amit Varma]: that need to be taken seriously

03:13:35.960 --> 03:13:37.960
[Amit Varma]: so therefore on the first day I have to do this

03:13:37.960 --> 03:13:39.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, the people who were in that

03:13:39.960 --> 03:13:41.960
[Amit Varma]: meeting who said boss, victory

03:13:41.960 --> 03:13:43.960
[Amit Varma]: I love the way you said that

03:13:43.960 --> 03:13:45.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, they are also responding to incentives

03:13:45.960 --> 03:13:47.960
[Amit Varma]: and I remember something that Jagdish

03:13:47.960 --> 03:13:49.960
[Amit Varma]: Bhagwati said a while back where he said that

03:13:49.960 --> 03:13:51.960
[Amit Varma]: India has a rent seeking mindset

03:13:51.960 --> 03:13:53.960
[Amit Varma]: China has a profit seeking mindset

03:13:53.960 --> 03:13:55.960
[Amit Varma]: now I don't know how true this is of China

03:13:55.960 --> 03:13:57.960
[Amit Varma]: but with India their rent seeking mindset

03:13:57.960 --> 03:13:59.960
[Amit Varma]: has certainly been there because

03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:01.960
[Amit Varma]: a lot of people I used to meet

03:14:01.960 --> 03:14:03.960
[Amit Varma]: who would talk of business or talk of whatever

03:14:03.960 --> 03:14:05.960
[Amit Varma]: were always looking for ways

03:14:05.960 --> 03:14:07.960
[Amit Varma]: in which they make someone a fool

03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:09.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, let's take advantage of someone

03:14:09.960 --> 03:14:11.960
[Amit Varma]: which is a rent seeking mindset

03:14:11.960 --> 03:14:13.960
[Guest 2]: and is complete nonsense

03:14:13.960 --> 03:14:15.960
[Amit Varma]: but this is what also this was

03:14:15.960 --> 03:14:17.960
[Amit Varma]: in a sense

03:14:17.960 --> 03:14:19.960
[Amit Varma]: so my theory of that is

03:14:19.960 --> 03:14:21.960
[Amit Varma]: that it is not that a

03:14:21.960 --> 03:14:23.960
[Amit Varma]: cultural norm comes out of

03:14:23.960 --> 03:14:25.960
[Amit Varma]: culture itself per se

03:14:25.960 --> 03:14:27.960
[Amit Varma]: but it is part of a feedback loop

03:14:27.960 --> 03:14:29.960
[Amit Varma]: with the institutions that exist

03:14:29.960 --> 03:14:31.960
[Amit Varma]: because since independence we were so

03:14:31.960 --> 03:14:33.960
[Amit Varma]: statist that the only way

03:14:33.960 --> 03:14:35.960
[Amit Varma]: for decades that you could make money

03:14:35.960 --> 03:14:37.960
[Amit Varma]: was either if you were part of the state

03:14:37.960 --> 03:14:39.960
[Amit Varma]: or if you could use state power to

03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:41.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, be a crony capitalist or whatever

03:14:41.960 --> 03:14:43.960
[Amit Varma]: but basically use other people's power

03:14:43.960 --> 03:14:45.960
[Amit Varma]: and earn rent that way

03:14:45.960 --> 03:14:47.960
[Amit Varma]: that brought about the rent seeking mindset

03:14:47.960 --> 03:14:49.960
[Amit Varma]: scarcity economy, no one has anything

03:14:49.960 --> 03:14:51.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, double thank you moments

03:14:51.960 --> 03:14:53.960
[Amit Varma]: in that sense are not conceivable if you don't have

03:14:53.960 --> 03:14:55.960
[Amit Varma]: a free market, so what do you do?

03:14:55.960 --> 03:14:57.960
[Amit Varma]: whereas from that

03:14:57.960 --> 03:14:59.960
[Amit Varma]: after 91 perhaps over the decades

03:14:59.960 --> 03:15:01.960
[Amit Varma]: we evolved to the situation

03:15:01.960 --> 03:15:03.960
[Amit Varma]: where today the best way to make money is you make

03:15:03.960 --> 03:15:05.960
[Amit Varma]: somebody else better off, positive

03:15:05.960 --> 03:15:07.960
[Amit Varma]: some game, you win, I win, double thank you moment

03:15:07.960 --> 03:15:09.960
[Amit Varma]: right, so do you

03:15:09.960 --> 03:15:11.960
[Amit Varma]: sense a shift in mindsets

03:15:11.960 --> 03:15:13.960
[Amit Varma]: from the Pablu setting

03:15:13.960 --> 03:15:15.960
[Amit Varma]: rent seeking mindset to something better

03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:17.960
[Amit Varma]: and even in terms of

03:15:17.960 --> 03:15:19.960
[Amit Varma]: Bollywood, like I'm just wondering, you know we talk

03:15:19.960 --> 03:15:21.960
[Amit Varma]: a lot about cultural norms

03:15:21.960 --> 03:15:23.960
[Amit Varma]: and we think of it almost as in terms of

03:15:23.960 --> 03:15:25.960
[Amit Varma]: hum toh aise hi hai

03:15:25.960 --> 03:15:27.960
[Amit Varma]: and I don't buy that completely

03:15:27.960 --> 03:15:29.960
[Amit Varma]: I don't think that a cultural

03:15:29.960 --> 03:15:31.960
[Amit Varma]: norm is purely cultural

03:15:31.960 --> 03:15:33.960
[Amit Varma]: and I don't think that, you know, when you say

03:15:33.960 --> 03:15:35.960
[Amit Varma]: young people are like this today, I don't

03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:37.960
[Amit Varma]: think that it's young people are like this

03:15:37.960 --> 03:15:39.960
[Amit Varma]: today only, I think the environment

03:15:39.960 --> 03:15:41.960
[Guest 2]: the incentives they are responding to plays a big

03:15:41.960 --> 03:15:43.960
[Guest 2]: part

03:15:43.960 --> 03:15:45.960
[Guest 2]: So, you know, Roshan, you would be in better

03:15:45.960 --> 03:15:47.960
[Guest 2]: position to answer this but generally

03:15:47.960 --> 03:15:49.960
[Guest 2]: about culture, you know, behavioral

03:15:49.960 --> 03:15:51.960
[Guest 2]: change takes a long time

03:15:51.960 --> 03:15:53.960
[Guest 2]: to set in but I have seen in certain

03:15:53.960 --> 03:15:55.960
[Guest 2]: organizations, come back to MTV right

03:15:55.960 --> 03:15:57.960
[Guest 2]: that if the organization

03:15:57.960 --> 03:15:59.960
[Guest 2]: has a cultural point, at

03:15:59.960 --> 03:16:01.960
[Guest 2]: least you know that there is a cultural change

03:16:01.960 --> 03:16:03.960
[Guest 2]: in that organization and when you say creative

03:16:03.960 --> 03:16:05.960
[Guest 2]: people, the young creative people

03:16:05.960 --> 03:16:07.960
[Guest 2]: and your observation, I would like to believe that

03:16:07.960 --> 03:16:09.960
[Guest 2]: a large part of them are working in the

03:16:09.960 --> 03:16:11.960
[Guest 2]: organization culture that you have set in

03:16:11.960 --> 03:16:13.960
[Guest 2]: which is at Commune, like in MTV

03:16:13.960 --> 03:16:15.960
[Guest 2]: the game changing moment for me

03:16:15.960 --> 03:16:17.960
[Guest 2]: to come out with my creative thoughts

03:16:17.960 --> 03:16:19.960
[Guest 2]: was there was this beautiful philosophy

03:16:19.960 --> 03:16:21.960
[Guest 2]: set by MTV US which

03:16:21.960 --> 03:16:23.960
[Guest 2]: was based on the principle of WQ

03:16:23.960 --> 03:16:25.960
[Guest 2]: which is Wackiness Quotient

03:16:25.960 --> 03:16:27.960
[Guest 2]: so the whole principle

03:16:27.960 --> 03:16:29.960
[Guest 2]: was any communication that goes from the

03:16:29.960 --> 03:16:31.960
[Guest 2]: marketing department, creative department, whichever

03:16:31.960 --> 03:16:33.960
[Guest 2]: has to have a WQ

03:16:33.960 --> 03:16:35.960
[Guest 2]: so even if you were making a

03:16:35.960 --> 03:16:37.960
[Guest 2]: merchandise in form of

03:16:37.960 --> 03:16:39.960
[Guest 2]: a cup, you wanted to see how

03:16:39.960 --> 03:16:41.960
[Guest 2]: creative it was, that was a cultural

03:16:41.960 --> 03:16:43.960
[Guest 2]: value which meant that even the

03:16:43.960 --> 03:16:45.960
[Guest 2]: finance guy, the accountant who is going to

03:16:45.960 --> 03:16:47.960
[Guest 2]: give you your salary has to do it

03:16:47.960 --> 03:16:49.960
[Guest 2]: in a Wackiness Quotient manner

03:16:49.960 --> 03:16:51.960
[Guest 2]: and I think that cultural value

03:16:51.960 --> 03:16:53.960
[Guest 2]: set the cultural tone of music

03:16:53.960 --> 03:16:55.960
[Guest 2]: television and therefore the creativity flourished

03:16:55.960 --> 03:16:57.960
[Guest 2]: at a country level

03:16:57.960 --> 03:16:59.960
[Guest 2]: is there a cultural value that can

03:16:59.960 --> 03:17:01.960
[Guest 2]: be set in is a big challenge

03:17:01.960 --> 03:17:03.960
[Guest 2]: and therefore when you say have things changed

03:17:03.960 --> 03:17:05.960
[Guest 2]: maybe in certain places

03:17:05.960 --> 03:17:07.960
[Guest 2]: where there has been an active

03:17:07.960 --> 03:17:09.960
[Guest 2]: role played by a certain senior

03:17:09.960 --> 03:17:11.960
[Guest 2]: member of the organization or for that matter

03:17:11.960 --> 03:17:13.960
[Guest 2]: that milieu that you know

03:17:13.960 --> 03:17:15.960
[Guest 2]: we want people to do this

03:17:15.960 --> 03:17:17.960
[Guest 2]: and therefore like you know there is this beautiful example

03:17:17.960 --> 03:17:19.960
[Guest 2]: that happened in Sweden

03:17:19.960 --> 03:17:21.960
[Guest 2]: where they said that we want to inculcate

03:17:21.960 --> 03:17:23.960
[Guest 2]: the habit of exercising

03:17:23.960 --> 03:17:25.960
[Guest 2]: on the go

03:17:25.960 --> 03:17:27.960
[Guest 2]: and therefore they created this

03:17:27.960 --> 03:17:29.960
[Guest 2]: escalator and then next to

03:17:29.960 --> 03:17:31.960
[Guest 2]: the escalator there were normal stairs

03:17:31.960 --> 03:17:33.960
[Guest 2]: which were designed in the form of

03:17:33.960 --> 03:17:35.960
[Unknown]: a piano and every time you

03:17:35.960 --> 03:17:37.960
[Guest 2]: stepped on the first step, there was a different

03:17:37.960 --> 03:17:39.960
[Guest 2]: sound and they realized that 50%

03:17:39.960 --> 03:17:41.960
[Guest 2]: of people using escalators

03:17:41.960 --> 03:17:43.960
[Guest 2]: had shifted too, so the visual cues

03:17:43.960 --> 03:17:45.960
[Guest 2]: were so strong in order to create

03:17:45.960 --> 03:17:47.960
[Guest 2]: a cultural value to exercise

03:17:47.960 --> 03:17:49.960
[Guest 2]: and I thought that was a great example

03:17:49.960 --> 03:17:51.960
[Guest 2]: we do it in one of the companies that I have invested

03:17:51.960 --> 03:17:53.960
[Guest 2]: in, we are trying to see if

03:17:53.960 --> 03:17:55.960
[Guest 2]: cafeterias in offices

03:17:55.960 --> 03:17:57.960
[Guest 2]: can be designed in such a way that

03:17:57.960 --> 03:17:59.960
[Guest 2]: the first thing you see is protein and

03:17:59.960 --> 03:18:01.960
[Guest 2]: water, so even if you have to

03:18:01.960 --> 03:18:03.960
[Guest 2]: go to the vada pav, you have to ensure

03:18:03.960 --> 03:18:05.960
[Guest 2]: that you are crossing the visual

03:18:05.960 --> 03:18:07.960
[Guest 2]: cues of having water

03:18:07.960 --> 03:18:09.960
[Guest 2]: having the protein and then going into

03:18:09.960 --> 03:18:11.960
[Guest 1]: carbohydrates in order to create that

03:18:11.960 --> 03:18:13.960
[Guest 1]: thing. This is in that book, you know

03:18:13.960 --> 03:18:15.960
[Guest 1]: where they actually change the entire

03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:17.960
[Guest 1]: order of shelves.

03:18:17.960 --> 03:18:19.960
[Amit Varma]: Nudge would have things about it.

03:18:19.960 --> 03:18:21.960
[Amit Varma]: It is in nudge and whatever.

03:18:21.960 --> 03:18:23.960
[Guest 2]: Nudge can be taken too far but these

03:18:23.960 --> 03:18:25.960
[Guest 2]: are great examples, I totally approve.

03:18:25.960 --> 03:18:27.960
[Guest 2]: So the thing is that this can be created

03:18:27.960 --> 03:18:29.960
[Guest 2]: but the behavioral change with all these

03:18:29.960 --> 03:18:31.960
[Guest 2]: visual cues, cumulatively

03:18:31.960 --> 03:18:33.960
[Guest 2]: in an entire generation,

03:18:33.960 --> 03:18:35.960
[Guest 2]: how they should be done, like you know for me

03:18:35.960 --> 03:18:37.960
[Guest 2]: this world cup, the winner is

03:18:37.960 --> 03:18:39.960
[Unknown]: Japan. Oh yeah.

03:18:39.960 --> 03:18:41.960
[Guest 2]: I mean if the Japanese have

03:18:41.960 --> 03:18:43.960
[Guest 2]: built one value in this world

03:18:43.960 --> 03:18:45.960
[Guest 1]: today has been when the Japanese fans

03:18:45.960 --> 03:18:47.960
[Guest 1]: clean the stadium

03:18:47.960 --> 03:18:49.960
[Guest 2]: before they left and then

03:18:49.960 --> 03:18:51.960
[Guest 2]: the PR happened on the players after

03:18:51.960 --> 03:18:53.960
[Guest 2]: they left the dressing room.

03:18:53.960 --> 03:18:55.960
[Guest 2]: That was completely clean. To me

03:18:55.960 --> 03:18:57.960
[Guest 2]: a big and then

03:18:57.960 --> 03:18:59.960
[Guest 2]: what happened in the next game, Saudi Arabia

03:18:59.960 --> 03:19:01.960
[Guest 2]: people cleaned the stadium after.

03:19:01.960 --> 03:19:03.960
[Guest 2]: This is the greatest example set

03:19:03.960 --> 03:19:05.960
[Guest 2]: by behavioral change

03:19:05.960 --> 03:19:07.960
[Guest 2]: by a team which is so

03:19:07.960 --> 03:19:09.960
[Guest 2]: influential today because of the kind of

03:19:09.960 --> 03:19:11.960
[Guest 2]: football also they are playing and I think

03:19:11.960 --> 03:19:13.960
[Guest 2]: if something of that nature happens

03:19:13.960 --> 03:19:15.960
[Guest 2]: in society, I think

03:19:15.960 --> 03:19:17.960
[Guest 2]: we will also move delta.

03:19:17.960 --> 03:19:19.960
[Guest 2]: Whether that's happening at a large youth

03:19:19.960 --> 03:19:21.960
[Guest 2]: level, I do not know but

03:19:21.960 --> 03:19:23.960
[Guest 2]: I think it is happening at an organizational

03:19:23.960 --> 03:19:25.960
[Guest 1]: level. No, I definitely think

03:19:25.960 --> 03:19:27.960
[Guest 1]: that you know I mean yes at

03:19:27.960 --> 03:19:29.960
[Guest 1]: Commune we do practice that kind

03:19:29.960 --> 03:19:31.960
[Guest 1]: of mindfulness etc but I notice it even

03:19:31.960 --> 03:19:33.960
[Guest 1]: outside. You do. Right and

03:19:33.960 --> 03:19:35.960
[Guest 1]: today there will be

03:19:35.960 --> 03:19:37.960
[Guest 1]: young people who will be part of your organization

03:19:37.960 --> 03:19:39.960
[Guest 1]: and remember on the group I would often use this word guys

03:19:39.960 --> 03:19:41.960
[Guest 1]: right guys can you do this?

03:19:41.960 --> 03:19:43.960
[Guest 1]: So one day you know this

03:19:43.960 --> 03:19:45.960
[Guest 1]: person said that you know

03:19:45.960 --> 03:19:47.960
[Guest 1]: I'd appreciate if you actually were a little more

03:19:47.960 --> 03:19:49.960
[Guest 1]: conscious of the fact that the team has

03:19:49.960 --> 03:19:51.960
[Guest 1]: people who might be gender fluid and people who

03:19:51.960 --> 03:19:53.960
[Guest 1]: you know have not you know

03:19:53.960 --> 03:19:55.960
[Guest 1]: would prefer if they referred to you referred

03:19:55.960 --> 03:19:57.960
[Guest 1]: to everybody from a different thing

03:19:57.960 --> 03:19:59.960
[Guest 1]: and the entire team

03:19:59.960 --> 03:20:01.960
[Guest 1]: appreciated it. I mean we all actually sat and when

03:20:01.960 --> 03:20:03.960
[Guest 1]: I am now conscious of this or whatever. Now

03:20:03.960 --> 03:20:05.960
[Guest 1]: sometimes you are taking things too far

03:20:05.960 --> 03:20:07.960
[Guest 1]: whatever. Hard discussions sometimes

03:20:07.960 --> 03:20:09.960
[Guest 1]: on these things. They

03:20:09.960 --> 03:20:11.960
[Guest 1]: are unafraid to say it.

03:20:11.960 --> 03:20:13.960
[Guest 1]: Now will everybody accept it

03:20:13.960 --> 03:20:15.960
[Guest 1]: at large? As you said this is a great example that you

03:20:15.960 --> 03:20:17.960
[Guest 1]: gave about you know what's happening in football right now

03:20:17.960 --> 03:20:19.960
[Guest 1]: today there was a thing that when they

03:20:19.960 --> 03:20:21.960
[Guest 1]: Japan lost the manager

03:20:21.960 --> 03:20:23.960
[Guest 1]: was standing there and bowing to all the fans

03:20:23.960 --> 03:20:25.960
[Guest 1]: and I mean it's beautiful or

03:20:25.960 --> 03:20:27.960
[Guest 1]: the Brazilian team

03:20:27.960 --> 03:20:29.960
[Guest 1]: guy hugging because his teammates with

03:20:29.960 --> 03:20:31.960
[Guest 1]: the rival team is the South Korean

03:20:31.960 --> 03:20:33.960
[Guest 1]: player and hugging him and saying that you know you gave your professional

03:20:33.960 --> 03:20:35.960
[Guest 1]: best and I did. I

03:20:35.960 --> 03:20:37.960
[Guest 1]: really it is these things that need to

03:20:37.960 --> 03:20:39.960
[Guest 1]: be celebrated a lot more.

03:20:39.960 --> 03:20:41.960
[Guest 1]: Somewhere I feel

03:20:41.960 --> 03:20:43.960
[Guest 1]: that we have also

03:20:43.960 --> 03:20:45.960
[Guest 1]: started in some

03:20:45.960 --> 03:20:47.960
[Guest 1]: bits like when roadies started happening I was

03:20:47.960 --> 03:20:49.960
[Guest 1]: a little scared. Because

03:20:49.960 --> 03:20:51.960
[Guest 1]: you somewhere

03:20:51.960 --> 03:20:53.960
[Guest 1]: when in Big Boss or roadies

03:20:53.960 --> 03:20:55.960
[Guest 1]: you bring in people

03:20:55.960 --> 03:20:57.960
[Guest 1]: and characters where you are celebrating

03:20:57.960 --> 03:20:59.960
[Guest 1]: the lowest common denominator

03:20:59.960 --> 03:21:01.960
[Guest 1]: not the highest common factor. You

03:21:01.960 --> 03:21:03.960
[Guest 1]: are doing it for TRP etc.

03:21:03.960 --> 03:21:05.960
[Guest 1]: But believe you me

03:21:05.960 --> 03:21:07.960
[Guest 1]: you are setting a bad precedent.

03:21:07.960 --> 03:21:09.960
[Guest 1]: To give you an example on the other

03:21:09.960 --> 03:21:11.960
[Guest 1]: side a boy used to work with me

03:21:11.960 --> 03:21:13.960
[Guest 1]: my content team and he was on the train going

03:21:13.960 --> 03:21:15.960
[Guest 1]: to Lucknow and he came back and said I've got to

03:21:15.960 --> 03:21:17.960
[Guest 1]: tell you the most brilliant thing. So what?

03:21:17.960 --> 03:21:19.960
[Guest 1]: He said that

03:21:19.960 --> 03:21:21.960
[Guest 1]: we were sitting in the train and suddenly

03:21:21.960 --> 03:21:23.960
[Guest 1]: you know his phone was borrowed

03:21:23.960 --> 03:21:25.960
[Guest 1]: by the other person because

03:21:25.960 --> 03:21:27.960
[Guest 1]: he wanted to use the internet.

03:21:27.960 --> 03:21:29.960
[Guest 1]: He said use this phone. He had two phones.

03:21:29.960 --> 03:21:31.960
[Guest 1]: I said why two phones?

03:21:31.960 --> 03:21:33.960
[Guest 1]: He said my parents also use this phone.

03:21:33.960 --> 03:21:35.960
[Guest 1]: I said

03:21:35.960 --> 03:21:37.960
[Guest 1]: do I watch MX on this?

03:21:37.960 --> 03:21:39.960
[Guest 1]: Right? And sometimes

03:21:39.960 --> 03:21:41.960
[Guest 1]: there is a channel of Balaji

03:21:41.960 --> 03:21:43.960
[Guest 1]: which has some adult content. I watch that

03:21:43.960 --> 03:21:45.960
[Guest 1]: but I keep this for my parents.

03:21:45.960 --> 03:21:47.960
[Guest 1]: India most

03:21:47.960 --> 03:21:49.960
[Guest 1]: young people everybody still

03:21:49.960 --> 03:21:51.960
[Guest 1]: has this sense which is

03:21:51.960 --> 03:21:53.960
[Guest 1]: why a Panchayat works.

03:21:53.960 --> 03:21:55.960
[Guest 1]: Which is why you know a Gullak works

03:21:55.960 --> 03:21:57.960
[Guest 1]: a Tathastu works at one

03:21:57.960 --> 03:21:59.960
[Guest 1]: level and we just

03:21:59.960 --> 03:22:01.960
[Guest 1]: need to learn to celebrate it a lot more.

03:22:01.960 --> 03:22:03.960
[Guest 1]: It's not that just the

03:22:03.960 --> 03:22:05.960
[Guest 1]: fine the blood and gore in a Mirzapur

03:22:05.960 --> 03:22:07.960
[Guest 1]: suddenly shocks you. But then it

03:22:07.960 --> 03:22:09.960
[Guest 1]: becomes that everyone wants to do that. You know like

03:22:09.960 --> 03:22:11.960
[Guest 1]: if you go to a OTT today to say

03:22:11.960 --> 03:22:13.960
[Guest 1]: what do you want to see?

03:22:13.960 --> 03:22:15.960
[Guest 1]: For two years ago I remember when we used to have meetings

03:22:15.960 --> 03:22:17.960
[Guest 1]: all discussions were boss

03:22:17.960 --> 03:22:19.960
[Guest 1]: you know sex, crime, murder

03:22:19.960 --> 03:22:21.960
[Guest 1]: extramarital affair.

03:22:21.960 --> 03:22:23.960
[Guest 1]: What are you saying?

03:22:23.960 --> 03:22:25.960
[Guest 1]: But there is a bunch of people who went

03:22:25.960 --> 03:22:27.960
[Guest 1]: back and said no we will keep bringing different things

03:22:27.960 --> 03:22:29.960
[Guest 1]: and they have created

03:22:29.960 --> 03:22:31.960
[Guest 1]: that space.

03:22:31.960 --> 03:22:33.960
[Guest 1]: So somewhere I do feel

03:22:33.960 --> 03:22:35.960
[Guest 1]: that this is a lot

03:22:35.960 --> 03:22:37.960
[Guest 1]: about I believe that this generation

03:22:37.960 --> 03:22:39.960
[Guest 1]: is very very different. I think one of the big

03:22:39.960 --> 03:22:41.960
[Guest 1]: things is remember that most of the people are born with

03:22:41.960 --> 03:22:43.960
[Guest 1]: the internet. They have been born

03:22:43.960 --> 03:22:45.960
[Guest 1]: with a window to many worlds.

03:22:45.960 --> 03:22:47.960
[Guest 1]: We had a window to either

03:22:47.960 --> 03:22:49.960
[Guest 1]: our neighbors or our parents.

03:22:49.960 --> 03:22:51.960
[Guest 1]: Parents told us

03:22:51.960 --> 03:22:53.960
[Guest 1]: those values.

03:22:53.960 --> 03:22:55.960
[Guest 1]: College or school or whatever.

03:22:55.960 --> 03:22:57.960
[Guest 1]: They have a million words.

03:22:57.960 --> 03:22:59.960
[Guest 1]: I can't stop my daughter from watching Euphoria

03:22:59.960 --> 03:23:01.960
[Guest 1]: which I am very scared that

03:23:01.960 --> 03:23:03.960
[Guest 1]: a 14 year old girl saw. What is Euphoria?

03:23:03.960 --> 03:23:05.960
[Guest 1]: So Euphoria is this show on Netflix

03:23:05.960 --> 03:23:07.960
[Guest 1]: which actually if you see had

03:23:07.960 --> 03:23:09.960
[Guest 1]: themes that were very extreme.

03:23:09.960 --> 03:23:11.960
[Guest 1]: You know so an underage person

03:23:11.960 --> 03:23:13.960
[Guest 1]: having an affair with a married man or whatever

03:23:13.960 --> 03:23:15.960
[Guest 1]: because of a dating thing that happens.

03:23:15.960 --> 03:23:17.960
[Guest 1]: Drug use etc. Casual

03:23:17.960 --> 03:23:19.960
[Guest 1]: sex. Now

03:23:19.960 --> 03:23:21.960
[Guest 1]: as a parent there was this big thing. But I

03:23:21.960 --> 03:23:23.960
[Guest 1]: also know that at the same time she has

03:23:23.960 --> 03:23:25.960
[Guest 1]: a set of values which she has been brought up with.

03:23:25.960 --> 03:23:27.960
[Guest 1]: There are conversations.

03:23:27.960 --> 03:23:29.960
[Guest 1]: My daughter can sit with me and have conversations

03:23:29.960 --> 03:23:31.960
[Guest 1]: on topics that she could. I can't

03:23:31.960 --> 03:23:33.960
[Guest 1]: believe my sister could have ever had with my father.

03:23:33.960 --> 03:23:35.960
[Guest 1]: And we have them. Sometimes

03:23:35.960 --> 03:23:37.960
[Guest 1]: it is to me a little difficult.

03:23:37.960 --> 03:23:39.960
[Guest 1]: And I will tell Shaheen to sit and

03:23:39.960 --> 03:23:41.960
[Guest 1]: say listen can you have this chat with her

03:23:41.960 --> 03:23:43.960
[Guest 1]: or whatever. I have to say Abba you are giving me

03:23:43.960 --> 03:23:45.960
[Guest 1]: that dad look. You know

03:23:45.960 --> 03:23:47.960
[Guest 1]: if she is dressing up or whatever and she is going

03:23:47.960 --> 03:23:49.960
[Guest 1]: out. Now she is at that age.

03:23:49.960 --> 03:23:51.960
[Guest 1]: There will be boys. There will be discovery.

03:23:51.960 --> 03:23:53.960
[Guest 1]: But you know

03:23:53.960 --> 03:23:55.960
[Guest 1]: as long as there are these

03:23:55.960 --> 03:23:57.960
[Guest 1]: multiple windows open. My

03:23:57.960 --> 03:23:59.960
[Guest 1]: fear is when the

03:23:59.960 --> 03:24:01.960
[Guest 1]: single window becomes that one window

03:24:01.960 --> 03:24:03.960
[Guest 1]: which everybody is celebrating which becomes

03:24:03.960 --> 03:24:05.960
[Guest 1]: the fad of the moment.

03:24:05.960 --> 03:24:07.960
[Guest 1]: And 90% of fads as you

03:24:07.960 --> 03:24:09.960
[Guest 1]: know are the negative fads are what algorithms

03:24:09.960 --> 03:24:11.960
[Guest 1]: pick up and put out because shock

03:24:11.960 --> 03:24:13.960
[Guest 1]: gets a lot more response. We react a lot

03:24:13.960 --> 03:24:15.960
[Guest 1]: faster. But

03:24:15.960 --> 03:24:17.960
[Guest 1]: somewhere when I see

03:24:17.960 --> 03:24:19.960
[Guest 1]: the better India story coming up on my

03:24:19.960 --> 03:24:21.960
[Guest 1]: feed I am a lot more happier saying

03:24:21.960 --> 03:24:23.960
[Guest 1]: this also comes. Or

03:24:23.960 --> 03:24:25.960
[Guest 1]: when I see the work that Yuva does. Nikhil was on your

03:24:25.960 --> 03:24:27.960
[Guest 1]: podcast or whatever. I am happy

03:24:27.960 --> 03:24:29.960
[Guest 1]: that there are

03:24:29.960 --> 03:24:31.960
[Guest 2]: channels like that as well which

03:24:31.960 --> 03:24:33.960
[Guest 2]: are giving that. Absolutely. And I think what

03:24:33.960 --> 03:24:35.960
[Guest 2]: Roshan you are saying is something that I have been saying

03:24:35.960 --> 03:24:37.960
[Guest 2]: to a lot of people because human beings

03:24:37.960 --> 03:24:39.960
[Guest 2]: are wired for negative right.

03:24:39.960 --> 03:24:41.960
[Guest 2]: You have 100 good things people say

03:24:41.960 --> 03:24:43.960
[Guest 2]: to you on social media but one guy abuses

03:24:43.960 --> 03:24:45.960
[Guest 2]: you. You live with that and that will

03:24:45.960 --> 03:24:47.960
[Guest 2]: depress you. And the only way

03:24:47.960 --> 03:24:49.960
[Guest 2]: to cure bad content is to make

03:24:49.960 --> 03:24:51.960
[Unknown]: good content. Yeah. There is no

03:24:51.960 --> 03:24:53.960
[Unknown]: other way out. How else? And that's why

03:24:53.960 --> 03:24:55.960
[Guest 2]: this whole thing that you don't make this

03:24:55.960 --> 03:24:57.960
[Guest 2]: you don't make that. That is not under our control.

03:24:57.960 --> 03:24:59.960
[Guest 2]: Make good content

03:24:59.960 --> 03:25:01.960
[Guest 2]: so that if 5 out of 100 people

03:25:01.960 --> 03:25:03.960
[Guest 2]: shift here you have created

03:25:03.960 --> 03:25:05.960
[Guest 2]: a movement. So that is why

03:25:05.960 --> 03:25:07.960
[Guest 2]: as a principal on social media

03:25:07.960 --> 03:25:09.960
[Guest 2]: I do not write anything negative.

03:25:09.960 --> 03:25:11.960
[Guest 2]: I do not reply. I will just see

03:25:11.960 --> 03:25:13.960
[Guest 2]: when you say good things that

03:25:13.960 --> 03:25:15.960
[Guest 2]: these guys have done good work you might get one

03:25:15.960 --> 03:25:17.960
[Unknown]: retweet. If you just one

03:25:17.960 --> 03:25:19.960
[Guest 2]: abuse you will get thousands. So your fan

03:25:19.960 --> 03:25:21.960
[Guest 2]: following which is a trap is going to make

03:25:21.960 --> 03:25:23.960
[Guest 2]: you say negative things. But as a

03:25:23.960 --> 03:25:25.960
[Guest 2]: principal if we are all in it

03:25:25.960 --> 03:25:27.960
[Guest 2]: together we have to ensure that

03:25:27.960 --> 03:25:29.960
[Guest 2]: the only way to break down negativity

03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:31.960
[Guest 2]: is to say hey this guy did this. Amit's

03:25:31.960 --> 03:25:33.960
[Guest 2]: podcast is very good. Roshan is doing this thing

03:25:33.960 --> 03:25:35.960
[Guest 2]: because even positivity

03:25:35.960 --> 03:25:37.960
[Guest 2]: now that time has come

03:25:37.960 --> 03:25:39.960
[Guest 2]: that if you give positive to the public

03:25:39.960 --> 03:25:41.960
[Guest 2]: then they can be addicted to positive as well.

03:25:41.960 --> 03:25:43.960
[Guest 2]: And I think that is the journey we all are

03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:45.960
[Amit Varma]: probably taking in our own lives. I think what I have kind of noticed

03:25:45.960 --> 03:25:47.960
[Amit Varma]: is if you look at the sort of virality

03:25:47.960 --> 03:25:49.960
[Amit Varma]: that happens. It is really

03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:51.960
[Amit Varma]: shitting on other people. Because here is the thing

03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:53.960
[Amit Varma]: if I am on Twitter and I

03:25:53.960 --> 03:25:55.960
[Amit Varma]: co-tweet you and I say something rude about you

03:25:55.960 --> 03:25:57.960
[Amit Varma]: something I would never do in real life but Twitter

03:25:57.960 --> 03:25:59.960
[Amit Varma]: makes it easy. Then what happens is

03:25:59.960 --> 03:26:01.960
[Amit Varma]: by standing in judgment over somebody

03:26:01.960 --> 03:26:03.960
[Amit Varma]: else I have made myself

03:26:03.960 --> 03:26:05.960
[Amit Varma]: feel more knowledgeable and virtuous.

03:26:05.960 --> 03:26:07.960
[Amit Varma]: And within my tribe if that other

03:26:07.960 --> 03:26:09.960
[Amit Varma]: person is hated then my status

03:26:09.960 --> 03:26:11.960
[Guest 2]: also goes up a little bit. Because if

03:26:11.960 --> 03:26:13.960
[Guest 2]: someone abuses you and I

03:26:13.960 --> 03:26:15.960
[Guest 2]: say Roshan is my friend and Roshan has given

03:26:15.960 --> 03:26:17.960
[Guest 2]: an abuse to you. We both are like

03:26:17.960 --> 03:26:19.960
[Guest 2]: Amit ki bajadi. So I

03:26:19.960 --> 03:26:21.960
[Guest 2]: am getting a dopamine rush

03:26:21.960 --> 03:26:23.960
[Guest 2]: because this guy

03:26:23.960 --> 03:26:25.960
[Guest 2]: has said something to you on Twitter. Now that's

03:26:25.960 --> 03:26:27.960
[Guest 2]: dangerous. Because what I am creating

03:26:27.960 --> 03:26:29.960
[Guest 2]: is there are billions of people like this

03:26:29.960 --> 03:26:31.960
[Guest 2]: abusing billions of people and

03:26:31.960 --> 03:26:33.960
[Guest 2]: they are getting a rush out of it. And

03:26:33.960 --> 03:26:35.960
[Amit Varma]: that is a monster you cannot control.

03:26:35.960 --> 03:26:37.960
[Amit Varma]: This is amplified at scale. In fact I wrote

03:26:37.960 --> 03:26:39.960
[Amit Varma]: a recent post about how Twitter could change for the

03:26:39.960 --> 03:26:41.960
[Amit Varma]: better and you know these incentives

03:26:41.960 --> 03:26:43.960
[Amit Varma]: I think can be changed. It's a structural

03:26:43.960 --> 03:26:45.960
[Amit Varma]: thing within Twitter that it's just

03:26:45.960 --> 03:26:47.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean they are trying to maximize engagement

03:26:47.960 --> 03:26:49.960
[Guest 2]: but it's kind of just

03:26:49.960 --> 03:26:51.960
[Guest 2]: I mean I said

03:26:51.960 --> 03:26:53.960
[Guest 2]: this to my friend that if

03:26:53.960 --> 03:26:55.960
[Guest 2]: Elon Musk really is serious he should make sure

03:26:55.960 --> 03:26:57.960
[Guest 2]: that after every thousand

03:26:57.960 --> 03:26:59.960
[Guest 2]: tweet, positive tweet, only

03:26:59.960 --> 03:27:01.960
[Guest 2]: those will get verified.

03:27:01.960 --> 03:27:03.960
[Guest 2]: In the sense

03:27:03.960 --> 03:27:05.960
[Guest 2]: that you are at least saying that we are

03:27:05.960 --> 03:27:07.960
[Guest 2]: using it more as an educational

03:27:07.960 --> 03:27:09.960
[Guest 2]: or you know unifying medium

03:27:09.960 --> 03:27:11.960
[Guest 2]: rather than all the negativity. But that's

03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:13.960
[Guest 1]: I mean it's just a joke. No no you know and see

03:27:13.960 --> 03:27:15.960
[Guest 1]: what happens. Look at this thing is that

03:27:15.960 --> 03:27:17.960
[Guest 1]: that the half-life of social

03:27:17.960 --> 03:27:19.960
[Guest 1]: mediums is

03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:21.960
[Guest 1]: decreasing as we go along.

03:27:21.960 --> 03:27:23.960
[Guest 1]: Facebook lasted for a long period

03:27:23.960 --> 03:27:25.960
[Guest 1]: of time. Then comes an Instagram

03:27:25.960 --> 03:27:27.960
[Guest 1]: little you know I mean it's there but again

03:27:27.960 --> 03:27:29.960
[Guest 1]: you can now see that certain parts of it are crumbling.

03:27:29.960 --> 03:27:31.960
[Guest 1]: WhatsApp etc. TikTok. Now

03:27:31.960 --> 03:27:33.960
[Guest 1]: there's this new thing which these

03:27:33.960 --> 03:27:35.960
[Guest 1]: young kids are using where you just

03:27:35.960 --> 03:27:37.960
[Guest 1]: take a picture once a day.

03:27:37.960 --> 03:27:39.960
[Guest 1]: Right. I'm just forgetting the name of the app. I'll try

03:27:39.960 --> 03:27:41.960
[Guest 1]: Not Snapchat or something. No no no.

03:27:41.960 --> 03:27:43.960
[Guest 1]: So there's something new. Is it called

03:27:43.960 --> 03:27:45.960
[Guest 1]: BU or something or whatever. It's just

03:27:45.960 --> 03:27:47.960
[Guest 1]: once a day you got to post a picture and it

03:27:47.960 --> 03:27:49.960
[Guest 1]: posts a picture of both sides. You

03:27:49.960 --> 03:27:51.960
[Guest 1]: and what you're seeing. Because

03:27:51.960 --> 03:27:53.960
[Guest 1]: they're saying over feeding

03:27:53.960 --> 03:27:55.960
[Guest 1]: is not going to work.

03:27:55.960 --> 03:27:57.960
[Guest 1]: You don't need to constantly fall

03:27:57.960 --> 03:27:59.960
[Guest 1]: trapped. So they are themselves reacting

03:27:59.960 --> 03:28:01.960
[Guest 1]: to it. They are building their own

03:28:01.960 --> 03:28:03.960
[Guest 1]: networks and these new networks

03:28:03.960 --> 03:28:05.960
[Guest 1]: will continue to happen. Everybody

03:28:05.960 --> 03:28:07.960
[Guest 1]: the minute Twitter started people started

03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:09.960
[Guest 1]: worrying about Twitter dying. Everybody

03:28:09.960 --> 03:28:11.960
[Guest 1]: started talking about this new network which is an

03:28:11.960 --> 03:28:13.960
[Guest 1]: online server based kind of network

03:28:13.960 --> 03:28:15.960
[Guest 1]: or whatever. People

03:28:15.960 --> 03:28:17.960
[Guest 1]: are making those choices.

03:28:17.960 --> 03:28:19.960
[Guest 1]: It's just that you do not get

03:28:19.960 --> 03:28:21.960
[Guest 1]: Twitch for example for gamers.

03:28:21.960 --> 03:28:23.960
[Guest 1]: We'll be here.

03:28:23.960 --> 03:28:25.960
[Guest 1]: Now in I mean

03:28:25.960 --> 03:28:27.960
[Guest 1]: you know dating app started or whatever

03:28:27.960 --> 03:28:29.960
[Guest 1]: Tinder etc. Oh this is too male centric

03:28:29.960 --> 03:28:31.960
[Guest 1]: blah blah blah. So for people who want

03:28:31.960 --> 03:28:33.960
[Guest 1]: to choose there is Grindr, there is Hinge, there is

03:28:33.960 --> 03:28:35.960
[Guest 1]: so and so, there is Bumble. I mean

03:28:35.960 --> 03:28:37.960
[Guest 1]: people will keep creating

03:28:37.960 --> 03:28:39.960
[Guest 1]: new ways. It's a matter of

03:28:39.960 --> 03:28:41.960
[Guest 1]: where people are going to move.

03:28:41.960 --> 03:28:43.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean the larger picture that I

03:28:43.960 --> 03:28:45.960
[Amit Varma]: look at is that

03:28:45.960 --> 03:28:47.960
[Amit Varma]: if you think about the biggest

03:28:47.960 --> 03:28:49.960
[Amit Varma]: sort of endeavor that

03:28:49.960 --> 03:28:51.960
[Amit Varma]: human beings have embarked upon in the last

03:28:51.960 --> 03:28:53.960
[Amit Varma]: few hundred years. It is the

03:28:53.960 --> 03:28:55.960
[Amit Varma]: endeavor to mitigate

03:28:55.960 --> 03:28:57.960
[Amit Varma]: our programming with our culture.

03:28:57.960 --> 03:28:59.960
[Amit Varma]: We are the only species

03:28:59.960 --> 03:29:01.960
[Amit Varma]: which can actually reflect on our programming

03:29:01.960 --> 03:29:03.960
[Amit Varma]: by which I mean our genes that can

03:29:03.960 --> 03:29:05.960
[Amit Varma]: think about our instincts and say that

03:29:05.960 --> 03:29:07.960
[Amit Varma]: no this is wrong I won't do it. For example a choice

03:29:07.960 --> 03:29:09.960
[Amit Varma]: not to have kids is actually against

03:29:09.960 --> 03:29:11.960
[Amit Varma]: our programming. We are wired

03:29:11.960 --> 03:29:13.960
[Amit Varma]: at some levels to be tribalistic.

03:29:13.960 --> 03:29:15.960
[Amit Varma]: We are also wired for the opposite. We are also

03:29:15.960 --> 03:29:17.960
[Amit Varma]: wired to be altruistic. Now the point

03:29:17.960 --> 03:29:19.960
[Amit Varma]: is like I love Steven Pinker's

03:29:19.960 --> 03:29:21.960
[Amit Varma]: birds that nature gives us

03:29:21.960 --> 03:29:23.960
[Amit Varma]: knobs nurture turns them.

03:29:23.960 --> 03:29:25.960
[Amit Varma]: Now the thing is we have all these knobs.

03:29:25.960 --> 03:29:27.960
[Amit Varma]: How are they being turned? Now what social

03:29:27.960 --> 03:29:29.960
[Amit Varma]: media has done is especially

03:29:29.960 --> 03:29:31.960
[Amit Varma]: Twitter in trying to maximize engagement

03:29:31.960 --> 03:29:33.960
[Amit Varma]: like Jonathan Haidt has pointed out how toxic

03:29:33.960 --> 03:29:35.960
[Amit Varma]: the Facebook like button and the Twitter retweet

03:29:35.960 --> 03:29:37.960
[Amit Varma]: button are and specifically

03:29:37.960 --> 03:29:39.960
[Amit Varma]: the Twitter quote tweet for the kind of

03:29:39.960 --> 03:29:41.960
[Amit Varma]: rudeness and interactions it encourages.

03:29:41.960 --> 03:29:43.960
[Amit Varma]: What it has done is that it has

03:29:43.960 --> 03:29:45.960
[Amit Varma]: amplified the worst aspects of

03:29:45.960 --> 03:29:47.960
[Amit Varma]: our character. The

03:29:47.960 --> 03:29:49.960
[Amit Varma]: tribalism, the antagonism, all of that.

03:29:49.960 --> 03:29:51.960
[Amit Varma]: Whereas I think that it is

03:29:51.960 --> 03:29:53.960
[Amit Varma]: possible to be intentional about it

03:29:53.960 --> 03:29:55.960
[Amit Varma]: and say that we won't amplify these

03:29:55.960 --> 03:29:57.960
[Amit Varma]: particular buttons but we'll

03:29:57.960 --> 03:29:59.960
[Amit Varma]: amplify others because we also

03:29:59.960 --> 03:30:01.960
[Amit Varma]: have that sense, that longing for

03:30:01.960 --> 03:30:03.960
[Amit Varma]: community, that longing. You know you want

03:30:03.960 --> 03:30:05.960
[Amit Varma]: to start those positive feedback loops.

03:30:05.960 --> 03:30:07.960
[Amit Varma]: But I think all of that is possible

03:30:07.960 --> 03:30:09.960
[Amit Varma]: but the one thing which will make it

03:30:09.960 --> 03:30:11.960
[Amit Varma]: possible is if people are well

03:30:11.960 --> 03:30:13.960
[Amit Varma]: fed. So we'll take a quick lunch break

03:30:13.960 --> 03:30:15.960
[Unknown]: and then we'll come back and

03:30:15.960 --> 03:30:17.960
[Amit Varma]: discuss the lessons that both of

03:30:17.960 --> 03:30:19.960
[Guest 2]: you have learnt in your rich careers. And food for

03:30:19.960 --> 03:30:23.960
[Guest 2]: thought.

03:30:49.960 --> 03:30:53.960
[Amit Varma]: And now it is time to revive it.

03:30:53.960 --> 03:30:55.960
[Amit Varma]: Only now I am doing it through

03:30:55.960 --> 03:30:57.960

[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen.

03:31:33.960 --> 03:31:35.960
[Amit Varma]: I am chatting with Roshan Abbas and Vikram Sathe

03:31:35.960 --> 03:31:37.960
[Amit Varma]: and Roshan just asked me to ask

03:31:37.960 --> 03:31:39.960
[Amit Varma]: Vikram an important question.

03:31:39.960 --> 03:31:41.960
[Unknown]: Vikram, when are you getting married?

03:31:43.960 --> 03:31:45.960
[Guest 2]: I haven't thought about it yet but

03:31:45.960 --> 03:31:47.960
[Amit Varma]: maybe one day.

03:31:47.960 --> 03:31:49.960
[Amit Varma]: So it's not a principled stand

03:31:49.960 --> 03:31:51.960
[Guest 2]: that you'll never get married.

03:31:51.960 --> 03:31:53.960
[Guest 2]: I told you I don't think so deeply.

03:31:55.960 --> 03:31:57.960
[Guest 1]: We unfortunately lost a friend

03:31:57.960 --> 03:31:59.960
[Guest 1]: who actually said

03:31:59.960 --> 03:32:01.960
[Guest 1]: that I'll die and you won't get married

03:32:01.960 --> 03:32:03.960
[Guest 1]: and that's what happened.

03:32:03.960 --> 03:32:05.960
[Guest 1]: Oh I'm so sorry.

03:32:05.960 --> 03:32:07.960
[Guest 1]: You know Sajja Chunawala I think or whatever.

03:32:07.960 --> 03:32:09.960
[Amit Varma]: I didn't know he passed away.

03:32:09.960 --> 03:32:11.960
[Amit Varma]: Couple of years ago.

03:32:11.960 --> 03:32:13.960
[Guest 1]: I used to make a standard joke every time

03:32:13.960 --> 03:32:15.960
[Unknown]: that had nothing to do with me.

03:32:17.960 --> 03:32:19.960
[Unknown]: Poor Sajja used to always say as a line

03:32:19.960 --> 03:32:21.960
[Guest 1]: that Vikram I'll die

03:32:21.960 --> 03:32:23.960
[Amit Varma]: and you won't get married.

03:32:23.960 --> 03:32:25.960
[Amit Varma]: But Roshan can't say this

03:32:25.960 --> 03:32:27.960
[Amit Varma]: because Roshan is going to live

03:32:27.960 --> 03:32:29.960
[Unknown]: till 120 years.

03:32:29.960 --> 03:32:31.960
[Unknown]: Exactly. So you know in the beginning

03:32:31.960 --> 03:32:33.960
[Unknown]: let's do this before we come to everything else.

03:32:33.960 --> 03:32:35.960
[Amit Varma]: In the beginning we were talking

03:32:35.960 --> 03:32:37.960
[Amit Varma]: about time and money and the moment

03:32:37.960 --> 03:32:39.960
[Amit Varma]: I asked the question I thought

03:32:39.960 --> 03:32:41.960
[Amit Varma]: Roshan has a lot of time because

03:32:41.960 --> 03:32:43.960
[Amit Varma]: you know I think there were three of us

03:32:43.960 --> 03:32:45.960
[Amit Varma]: and a fourth person. We were sitting

03:32:45.960 --> 03:32:47.960
[Amit Varma]: in Roshan's house and Roshan was talking

03:32:47.960 --> 03:32:49.960
[Amit Varma]: about how we are all going to live till 120

03:32:49.960 --> 03:32:51.960
[Amit Varma]: and healthy lives. Not that 30 years

03:32:51.960 --> 03:32:53.960
[Amit Varma]: have passed in dementia and we don't remember anything

03:32:53.960 --> 03:32:55.960
[Amit Varma]: which is already the case with you.

03:32:55.960 --> 03:32:57.960
[Amit Varma]: And I asked Roshan

03:32:57.960 --> 03:32:59.960
[Amit Varma]: how many of the

03:32:59.960 --> 03:33:01.960
[Amit Varma]: four of us on this table will reach 120

03:33:01.960 --> 03:33:03.960
[Amit Varma]: and he said at least two.

03:33:03.960 --> 03:33:05.960
[Amit Varma]: But I wanted to expound

03:33:05.960 --> 03:33:07.960
[Amit Varma]: on that because when you

03:33:07.960 --> 03:33:09.960
[Amit Varma]: sort of explain that, everything

03:33:09.960 --> 03:33:11.960
[Amit Varma]: about it seemed very

03:33:11.960 --> 03:33:13.960
[Amit Varma]: rational and in fact over the last few

03:33:13.960 --> 03:33:15.960
[Amit Varma]: months I have also been doing my little

03:33:15.960 --> 03:33:17.960
[Amit Varma]: bits of biohacking, reverse type 2 diabetes

03:33:17.960 --> 03:33:19.960
[Amit Varma]: all of that. So I understand

03:33:19.960 --> 03:33:21.960
[Amit Varma]: that we know a bit

03:33:21.960 --> 03:33:23.960
[Amit Varma]: more than we used to and

03:33:23.960 --> 03:33:25.960
[Amit Varma]: a lot of progress is being made

03:33:25.960 --> 03:33:27.960
[Amit Varma]: in this field not just

03:33:27.960 --> 03:33:29.960
[Amit Varma]: in terms of understanding it to begin with.

03:33:29.960 --> 03:33:31.960
[Guest 1]: Tell me your thoughts on it.

03:33:31.960 --> 03:33:33.960
[Guest 1]: So I think you know when we were growing up

03:33:33.960 --> 03:33:35.960
[Guest 1]: and I remember in school whenever

03:33:35.960 --> 03:33:37.960
[Guest 1]: there used to be any and you know

03:33:37.960 --> 03:33:39.960
[Guest 1]: textbooks used to have a little bit on

03:33:39.960 --> 03:33:41.960
[Guest 1]: India's past and stuff and

03:33:41.960 --> 03:33:43.960
[Guest 1]: I always remember that it used to say that

03:33:43.960 --> 03:33:45.960
[Guest 1]: in the Vedas they used to say that there are four

03:33:45.960 --> 03:33:47.960
[Guest 1]: you know parts of

03:33:47.960 --> 03:33:49.960
[Guest 1]: a man's life

03:33:49.960 --> 03:33:51.960
[Guest 1]: and they used to say 25 years which is Brahmacharya

03:33:51.960 --> 03:33:53.960
[Guest 1]: 25 years which is Grahasthya

03:33:53.960 --> 03:33:55.960
[Guest 1]: 25 which is Vriddha and 25

03:33:55.960 --> 03:33:57.960
[Guest 1]: which is Sanyas. So obviously they were

03:33:57.960 --> 03:33:59.960
[Guest 1]: looking at a 100 year life span then

03:33:59.960 --> 03:34:01.960
[Guest 1]: as an imagined idea. Now let's

03:34:01.960 --> 03:34:03.960
[Guest 1]: say whatever happened, life happened you know

03:34:03.960 --> 03:34:05.960
[Guest 1]: and stuff. Today

03:34:05.960 --> 03:34:07.960
[Guest 1]: we have now reached with a certain number

03:34:07.960 --> 03:34:09.960
[Guest 1]: of scientists and I mean

03:34:09.960 --> 03:34:11.960
[Guest 1]: which is why this whole thing about you know

03:34:11.960 --> 03:34:13.960
[Guest 1]: what alternate therapies work

03:34:13.960 --> 03:34:15.960
[Guest 1]: what don't and

03:34:15.960 --> 03:34:17.960
[Guest 1]: now I guess when I have a certain amount of time

03:34:17.960 --> 03:34:19.960
[Guest 1]: I've started exploring that a lot. I think a lot of it

03:34:19.960 --> 03:34:21.960
[Guest 1]: started with my parents aging.

03:34:21.960 --> 03:34:23.960
[Guest 1]: I am like any other

03:34:23.960 --> 03:34:25.960
[Guest 1]: person I'm sure I mean I'm obsessed with my parents

03:34:25.960 --> 03:34:27.960
[Guest 1]: and I keep constantly trying to see how

03:34:27.960 --> 03:34:29.960
[Guest 1]: you know my dad's 82 okay so

03:34:29.960 --> 03:34:31.960
[Guest 1]: how can he lead to leave a healthy 100

03:34:31.960 --> 03:34:33.960
[Guest 1]: and a

03:34:33.960 --> 03:34:35.960
[Guest 1]: wealth conference which I host every year

03:34:35.960 --> 03:34:37.960
[Guest 1]: had a person who came and said

03:34:37.960 --> 03:34:39.960
[Guest 1]: so once you have made money

03:34:39.960 --> 03:34:41.960
[Guest 1]: what stands in the

03:34:41.960 --> 03:34:43.960
[Guest 1]: way of you enjoying it and people said

03:34:43.960 --> 03:34:45.960
[Guest 1]: you know time and this and that and the

03:34:45.960 --> 03:34:47.960
[Guest 1]: person said no it's just health and

03:34:47.960 --> 03:34:49.960
[Guest 1]: longevity and which is why

03:34:49.960 --> 03:34:51.960
[Guest 1]: most entrepreneurs you know

03:34:51.960 --> 03:34:53.960
[Guest 1]: who have made big money are now investing in

03:34:53.960 --> 03:34:55.960
[Guest 1]: health tech and are

03:34:55.960 --> 03:34:57.960
[Guest 1]: looking at longevity as a science.

03:34:57.960 --> 03:34:59.960
[Guest 1]: What this has led to is

03:34:59.960 --> 03:35:01.960
[Guest 1]: a lot of you know

03:35:01.960 --> 03:35:03.960
[Guest 1]: looking at the future

03:35:03.960 --> 03:35:05.960
[Guest 1]: and some amount of looking at the past for solutions.

03:35:05.960 --> 03:35:07.960
[Guest 1]: Yesterday I was

03:35:07.960 --> 03:35:09.960
[Guest 1]: reading something about the vagus nerve in

03:35:09.960 --> 03:35:11.960
[Guest 1]: our body because you know we were talking about

03:35:11.960 --> 03:35:13.960
[Guest 1]: anxiety me and my wife and stuff and it said it's a

03:35:13.960 --> 03:35:15.960
[Guest 1]: vagabond nerve. It's present

03:35:15.960 --> 03:35:17.960
[Guest 1]: it's not present from one point to one point it's present

03:35:17.960 --> 03:35:19.960
[Guest 1]: in so many places and then the

03:35:19.960 --> 03:35:21.960
[Guest 1]: ways in which bringing down anxiety

03:35:21.960 --> 03:35:23.960
[Guest 1]: etc was mentioned seemed a little

03:35:23.960 --> 03:35:25.960
[Guest 1]: bit of yoga seemed a little bit of science

03:35:25.960 --> 03:35:27.960
[Guest 1]: Deepak Chopra was talking about as well

03:35:27.960 --> 03:35:29.960
[Guest 1]: and I'm slowly going towards

03:35:29.960 --> 03:35:31.960
[Guest 1]: saying that there are five facts that I have now

03:35:31.960 --> 03:35:33.960
[Guest 1]: David Sinclair someone I follow now very closely

03:35:33.960 --> 03:35:35.960
[Guest 1]: there is of course

03:35:35.960 --> 03:35:37.960
[Guest 1]: Huberman I think is another

03:35:37.960 --> 03:35:39.960
[Guest 1]: person who you know talks a lot about health and

03:35:39.960 --> 03:35:41.960
[Guest 1]: these two people I follow and

03:35:41.960 --> 03:35:43.960
[Guest 1]: David Sinclair I follow like obsessively

03:35:43.960 --> 03:35:45.960
[Guest 1]: He's written this great book called Lifespan. Yeah exactly

03:35:45.960 --> 03:35:47.960
[Guest 1]: and apart from the book the podcast

03:35:47.960 --> 03:35:49.960
[Guest 1]: he did on Lifespan with the person who

03:35:49.960 --> 03:35:51.960
[Guest 1]: helped him co-author the book in which they

03:35:51.960 --> 03:35:53.960
[Guest 1]: asked a lot of questions and it seemed to break it down

03:35:53.960 --> 03:35:55.960
[Guest 1]: ultimately to a couple of things.

03:35:55.960 --> 03:35:57.960
[Guest 1]: One was a very simple thing of turning and saying that

03:35:57.960 --> 03:35:59.960
[Guest 1]: your body needs enough time

03:35:59.960 --> 03:36:01.960
[Guest 1]: to regenerate which is why it requires

03:36:01.960 --> 03:36:03.960
[Guest 1]: more than 8 hours of sleep. Most of us don't get

03:36:03.960 --> 03:36:05.960
[Guest 1]: that. So A if you can move

03:36:05.960 --> 03:36:07.960
[Guest 1]: towards that. Secondly, cells

03:36:07.960 --> 03:36:09.960
[Guest 1]: need to be shocked out of complacency

03:36:09.960 --> 03:36:11.960
[Guest 1]: so over a period of time

03:36:11.960 --> 03:36:13.960
[Guest 1]: our body becomes absolutely complacent. Our muscle

03:36:13.960 --> 03:36:15.960
[Guest 1]: tissue at some point will stop generating because

03:36:15.960 --> 03:36:17.960
[Guest 1]: your brain is saying I can only now

03:36:17.960 --> 03:36:19.960
[Guest 1]: take care of X amount of things so if he's not using

03:36:19.960 --> 03:36:21.960
[Guest 1]: his arms too much let that muscle

03:36:21.960 --> 03:36:23.960
[Guest 1]: degenerate let me focus on the legs or other parts

03:36:23.960 --> 03:36:25.960
[Guest 1]: or whatever. So therefore

03:36:25.960 --> 03:36:27.960
[Guest 1]: if you really want to look

03:36:27.960 --> 03:36:29.960
[Guest 1]: at how to keep

03:36:29.960 --> 03:36:31.960
[Guest 1]: your cells enhanced

03:36:31.960 --> 03:36:33.960
[Guest 1]: you've got to give them extremes and which is why if you see

03:36:33.960 --> 03:36:35.960
[Guest 1]: there's a lot of extreme temperature therapy.

03:36:35.960 --> 03:36:37.960
[Guest 1]: So if you go towards the fjords

03:36:37.960 --> 03:36:39.960
[Guest 1]: or anything which is above the Arctic Circle there's

03:36:39.960 --> 03:36:41.960
[Guest 1]: a lot of ice dipping that happens.

03:36:41.960 --> 03:36:43.960
[Guest 1]: I had gone to Finland for a thing and

03:36:43.960 --> 03:36:45.960
[Guest 1]: one day they were doing this breaking an ice

03:36:45.960 --> 03:36:47.960
[Guest 1]: thing and actually everybody diving and how long could

03:36:47.960 --> 03:36:49.960
[Guest 1]: they stay inside. But today it's a scientifically

03:36:49.960 --> 03:36:51.960
[Guest 1]: proven fact that if you spend

03:36:51.960 --> 03:36:53.960
[Guest 1]: time in really

03:36:53.960 --> 03:36:55.960
[Guest 1]: you know water which is below zero degrees

03:36:55.960 --> 03:36:57.960
[Guest 1]: the cells are shocked into saying

03:36:57.960 --> 03:36:59.960
[Guest 1]: oh these cells have crossed the extreme

03:36:59.960 --> 03:37:01.960
[Guest 1]: they should die. These cells are now

03:37:01.960 --> 03:37:03.960
[Guest 1]: in their prime and they need to be primed to

03:37:03.960 --> 03:37:05.960
[Guest 1]: handle this as well. Saunas and

03:37:05.960 --> 03:37:07.960
[Guest 1]: extreme heat. So therefore extreme

03:37:07.960 --> 03:37:09.960
[Guest 1]: temperature events if you introduce in your life

03:37:09.960 --> 03:37:11.960
[Guest 1]: they immediately lead to more longevity.

03:37:11.960 --> 03:37:13.960
[Guest 1]: Personally I've researched it

03:37:13.960 --> 03:37:15.960
[Guest 1]: read about it and I'm trying to see if one can do

03:37:15.960 --> 03:37:17.960
[Guest 1]: it to a certain degree. I've tried a little bit of it

03:37:17.960 --> 03:37:19.960
[Guest 1]: the ice therapy is bloody cold and

03:37:19.960 --> 03:37:21.960
[Guest 1]: difficult but it's crazy when you do it

03:37:21.960 --> 03:37:23.960
[Guest 1]: you really feel invigorated. There's something about

03:37:23.960 --> 03:37:25.960
[Guest 1]: it. The two things which

03:37:25.960 --> 03:37:27.960
[Guest 1]: are chemical formulas which seem

03:37:27.960 --> 03:37:29.960
[Guest 1]: to really work is what

03:37:29.960 --> 03:37:31.960
[Guest 1]: David Sinclair has researched a

03:37:31.960 --> 03:37:33.960
[Guest 1]: lot. Of course a lot of the research is on mice

03:37:33.960 --> 03:37:35.960
[Guest 1]: now some of it is getting into human trials

03:37:35.960 --> 03:37:37.960
[Guest 1]: or whatever is two

03:37:37.960 --> 03:37:39.960
[Guest 1]: things called resveratrol and NMN

03:37:39.960 --> 03:37:41.960
[Guest 1]: slash NAD

03:37:41.960 --> 03:37:43.960
[Guest 1]: one he calls the petrol the

03:37:43.960 --> 03:37:45.960
[Guest 1]: other he calls the accelerator.

03:37:45.960 --> 03:37:47.960
[Guest 1]: So he says you know that you need

03:37:47.960 --> 03:37:49.960
[Guest 1]: both of them. One

03:37:49.960 --> 03:37:51.960
[Guest 1]: helps so after a certain point in

03:37:51.960 --> 03:37:53.960
[Guest 1]: time the cells do not produce internal

03:37:53.960 --> 03:37:55.960
[Guest 1]: energy to be able to keep themselves going which

03:37:55.960 --> 03:37:57.960
[Guest 1]: is why NMN is needed and

03:37:57.960 --> 03:37:59.960
[Guest 1]: resveratrol is the pedal

03:37:59.960 --> 03:38:01.960
[Guest 1]: which makes sure that there is acceleration

03:38:01.960 --> 03:38:03.960
[Guest 1]: in terms of that. So these are two more

03:38:03.960 --> 03:38:05.960
[Guest 1]: habits. And then breathing

03:38:05.960 --> 03:38:07.960
[Guest 1]: where a lot of

03:38:07.960 --> 03:38:09.960
[Guest 1]: what I have learned over the years

03:38:09.960 --> 03:38:11.960
[Guest 1]: is now I mean when I did

03:38:11.960 --> 03:38:13.960
[Guest 1]: yoga many many years ago and then gave it up

03:38:13.960 --> 03:38:15.960
[Guest 1]: entirely and now I just try to practice

03:38:15.960 --> 03:38:17.960
[Guest 1]: if nothing else most of

03:38:17.960 --> 03:38:19.960
[Guest 1]: people do shallow breathing which is like

03:38:19.960 --> 03:38:21.960
[Guest 1]: we take about 12 to 15 breaths in a minute.

03:38:21.960 --> 03:38:23.960
[Guest 1]: Whenever you will practice

03:38:23.960 --> 03:38:25.960
[Guest 1]: breathing as a practice you will realize

03:38:25.960 --> 03:38:27.960
[Guest 1]: that people are bringing it down to about 4 breaths

03:38:27.960 --> 03:38:29.960
[Guest 1]: a minute and that is again

03:38:29.960 --> 03:38:31.960
[Guest 1]: because you know like so

03:38:31.960 --> 03:38:33.960
[Guest 1]: a simple technique is what you call a

03:38:33.960 --> 03:38:35.960
[Guest 1]: 4-7-8 which is

03:38:35.960 --> 03:38:37.960
[Guest 1]: you take a breath in a sharp exhale

03:38:37.960 --> 03:38:39.960
[Guest 1]: inhale of 4 hold for

03:38:39.960 --> 03:38:41.960
[Guest 1]: a 7 and exhale at 8. So

03:38:41.960 --> 03:38:43.960
[Guest 1]: that with various

03:38:43.960 --> 03:38:45.960
[Guest 1]: kinds of breathing you are actually

03:38:45.960 --> 03:38:47.960
[Guest 1]: able to get your body rid of a lot

03:38:47.960 --> 03:38:49.960
[Guest 1]: of toxins, get a lot of your anxiety out

03:38:49.960 --> 03:38:51.960
[Guest 1]: your stress out and I

03:38:51.960 --> 03:38:53.960
[Guest 1]: you know I have always looked at cancer

03:38:53.960 --> 03:38:55.960
[Guest 1]: and I know that somewhat of cancer obviously

03:38:55.960 --> 03:38:57.960
[Guest 1]: I don't know about the heredity

03:38:57.960 --> 03:38:59.960
[Guest 1]: I am not a doctor but I have always

03:38:59.960 --> 03:39:01.960
[Guest 1]: somehow found that there is a lot of

03:39:01.960 --> 03:39:03.960
[Guest 1]: life events that are associated with a

03:39:03.960 --> 03:39:05.960
[Guest 1]: set of people who get some of these diseases

03:39:05.960 --> 03:39:07.960
[Guest 1]: which has a lot of stress

03:39:07.960 --> 03:39:09.960
[Guest 1]: a lot of anxiety and stuff. So I think if

03:39:09.960 --> 03:39:11.960
[Guest 1]: one can follow some of these things

03:39:11.960 --> 03:39:13.960
[Guest 1]: definitely we

03:39:13.960 --> 03:39:15.960
[Guest 1]: will bring our life spans up

03:39:15.960 --> 03:39:17.960
[Guest 1]: and it is happening already

03:39:17.960 --> 03:39:19.960
[Guest 1]: you know I mean I can easily see

03:39:19.960 --> 03:39:21.960
[Guest 1]: 100 but if you

03:39:21.960 --> 03:39:23.960
[Guest 1]: are able to even do your diet

03:39:23.960 --> 03:39:25.960
[Guest 1]: you know which and food is something

03:39:25.960 --> 03:39:27.960
[Guest 1]: which is the only place where I don't want to control

03:39:27.960 --> 03:39:29.960
[Guest 1]: my diet I want to enjoy good food

03:39:29.960 --> 03:39:31.960
[Guest 1]: with this combination 120

03:39:31.960 --> 03:39:33.960
[Guest 1]: and it is happening. You go to

03:39:33.960 --> 03:39:35.960
[Guest 1]: Okinawa and I mean this entire research

03:39:35.960 --> 03:39:37.960
[Guest 1]: that happened about Japan and

03:39:37.960 --> 03:39:39.960
[Guest 1]: why the people in this particular region of Japan

03:39:39.960 --> 03:39:41.960
[Guest 1]: have an average life span

03:39:41.960 --> 03:39:43.960
[Guest 1]: of about 100 plus and some of them

03:39:43.960 --> 03:39:45.960
[Guest 1]: are 120, 118 etc

03:39:45.960 --> 03:39:47.960
[Guest 1]: have lived that long and lived

03:39:47.960 --> 03:39:49.960
[Guest 1]: healthy lives to that age

03:39:49.960 --> 03:39:51.960
[Guest 1]: so I personally believe

03:39:51.960 --> 03:39:53.960
[Guest 1]: in this I am trying a lot of this right

03:39:53.960 --> 03:39:55.960
[Guest 1]: now so maybe in

03:39:55.960 --> 03:39:57.960
[Guest 1]: episode 3000 and whatever

03:39:57.960 --> 03:39:59.960
[Guest 1]: when you and I have reached that healthy

03:39:59.960 --> 03:40:01.960
[Unknown]: happy 100 we will celebrate it

03:40:01.960 --> 03:40:03.960
[Amit Varma]: Sir you will reach there

03:40:03.960 --> 03:40:05.960
[Amit Varma]: don't expect too much from me

03:40:05.960 --> 03:40:07.960
[Amit Varma]: No no I mean

03:40:07.960 --> 03:40:09.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean the part that scares

03:40:09.960 --> 03:40:11.960
[Amit Varma]: me about aging is really the decline

03:40:11.960 --> 03:40:13.960
[Amit Varma]: you know I saw my father's quick decline

03:40:13.960 --> 03:40:15.960
[Amit Varma]: where he kind of almost lost his personhood

03:40:15.960 --> 03:40:17.960
[Amit Varma]: in a sense your autonomy goes your

03:40:17.960 --> 03:40:19.960
[Amit Varma]: dignity is a threat and all of that

03:40:19.960 --> 03:40:21.960
[Amit Varma]: and that's something that kind of

03:40:21.960 --> 03:40:23.960
[Amit Varma]: scares me about it so what kind of lifestyle changes

03:40:23.960 --> 03:40:25.960
[Amit Varma]: did you have you actually

03:40:25.960 --> 03:40:27.960
[Guest 1]: so as I told you that

03:40:27.960 --> 03:40:29.960
[Guest 1]: supplements is something I am definitely doing

03:40:29.960 --> 03:40:31.960
[Guest 1]: breathing I definitely try to do

03:40:31.960 --> 03:40:33.960
[Guest 1]: currently I try to do it for about 15 minutes

03:40:33.960 --> 03:40:35.960
[Guest 1]: I am also a big hacker in terms of

03:40:35.960 --> 03:40:37.960
[Guest 1]: finding tech so there are

03:40:37.960 --> 03:40:39.960
[Guest 1]: at least two devices that I started

03:40:39.960 --> 03:40:41.960
[Guest 1]: using quite regularly

03:40:41.960 --> 03:40:43.960
[Guest 1]: one was almost this brain scan

03:40:43.960 --> 03:40:45.960
[Guest 1]: you know

03:40:45.960 --> 03:40:47.960
[Guest 1]: Muse is what it's called

03:40:47.960 --> 03:40:49.960
[Guest 1]: and it's a band that was actually created

03:40:49.960 --> 03:40:51.960
[Guest 1]: originally to check brain waves then they realize

03:40:51.960 --> 03:40:53.960
[Guest 1]: they can actually start telling your theta

03:40:53.960 --> 03:40:55.960
[Guest 1]: state your beta state etc and if you

03:40:55.960 --> 03:40:57.960
[Guest 1]: actually use that app and it is phenomenally

03:40:57.960 --> 03:40:59.960
[Guest 1]: well done the app

03:40:59.960 --> 03:41:01.960
[Guest 1]: it's able to give you

03:41:01.960 --> 03:41:03.960
[Guest 1]: a very deep understanding of which meditative

03:41:03.960 --> 03:41:05.960
[Guest 1]: state you are in and I

03:41:05.960 --> 03:41:07.960
[Guest 1]: really really enjoy that

03:41:07.960 --> 03:41:09.960
[Guest 1]: I practice that

03:41:09.960 --> 03:41:11.960
[Guest 1]: it's now reaching the next level

03:41:11.960 --> 03:41:13.960
[Guest 1]: as another device that is coming in

03:41:13.960 --> 03:41:15.960
[Guest 1]: we both tried to do that glucose

03:41:15.960 --> 03:41:17.960
[Guest 1]: monitoring, CGM

03:41:17.960 --> 03:41:19.960
[Guest 1]: and Sathe is a big

03:41:19.960 --> 03:41:21.960
[Guest 1]: proponent of it in fact he is invested in a company

03:41:21.960 --> 03:41:23.960
[Guest 1]: that is working on that as well

03:41:23.960 --> 03:41:25.960
[Guest 1]: I just think the price point is very high

03:41:25.960 --> 03:41:27.960
[Guest 1]: for average people right now to be able to do it

03:41:27.960 --> 03:41:29.960
[Guest 1]: because 4000 bucks sold for

03:41:29.960 --> 03:41:31.960
[Guest 1]: 15 days is a little high for

03:41:31.960 --> 03:41:33.960
[Guest 1]: everybody to invest, my mother almost died when I told her

03:41:33.960 --> 03:41:35.960
[Guest 1]: that 4000 bucks

03:41:35.960 --> 03:41:37.960
[Guest 1]: I was like mom what is the point

03:41:37.960 --> 03:41:39.960
[Guest 1]: but you know again I think

03:41:39.960 --> 03:41:41.960
[Guest 1]: as long as you can monitor, of course there are people

03:41:41.960 --> 03:41:43.960
[Guest 1]: who have views of saying how much you should

03:41:43.960 --> 03:41:45.960
[Guest 1]: monitor but I don't get anxious

03:41:45.960 --> 03:41:47.960
[Guest 1]: so the thing is that I am not, I am constantly

03:41:47.960 --> 03:41:49.960
[Guest 1]: looking on it and saying hey this is just one more

03:41:49.960 --> 03:41:51.960
[Guest 1]: parameter that I can possibly tweak with

03:41:51.960 --> 03:41:53.960
[Guest 1]: Alzheimer's if you don't know

03:41:53.960 --> 03:41:55.960
[Guest 1]: even reading but the drug which is

03:41:55.960 --> 03:41:57.960
[Guest 1]: now shown about 28%

03:41:57.960 --> 03:41:59.960
[Guest 1]: people have had reduction of

03:41:59.960 --> 03:42:01.960
[Guest 1]: symptoms, it's definitely going to

03:42:01.960 --> 03:42:03.960
[Guest 1]: clinical trial, it's already doing some

03:42:03.960 --> 03:42:05.960
[Guest 1]: human trials, I think it will be full, so

03:42:05.960 --> 03:42:07.960
[Guest 1]: there was another book that I came across

03:42:07.960 --> 03:42:09.960
[Amit Varma]: I think which, Factfulness if I am not mistaken

03:42:09.960 --> 03:42:11.960
[Amit Varma]: Hans Rosling, right and which turned

03:42:11.960 --> 03:42:13.960
[Guest 1]: and said that look at the facts around

03:42:13.960 --> 03:42:15.960
[Guest 1]: you and some of the facts will actually prove to you

03:42:15.960 --> 03:42:17.960
[Guest 1]: that we are in a better world than before

03:42:17.960 --> 03:42:19.960
[Guest 1]: what a different world, right

03:42:19.960 --> 03:42:21.960
[Guest 1]: what was disease 200

03:42:21.960 --> 03:42:23.960
[Guest 1]: years ago and what it is, so if you look at just

03:42:23.960 --> 03:42:25.960
[Guest 1]: that cycle, look at where

03:42:25.960 --> 03:42:27.960
[Guest 1]: we are going to go, so I am constantly monitoring

03:42:27.960 --> 03:42:29.960
[Guest 1]: it, I keep doing a couple of these things

03:42:29.960 --> 03:42:31.960
[Guest 1]: that extreme, so we've just yesterday started

03:42:31.960 --> 03:42:33.960
[Guest 1]: looking for a bathtub in which we can

03:42:33.960 --> 03:42:35.960
[Guest 1]: put ice and do ice baths, I don't know

03:42:35.960 --> 03:42:37.960
[Guest 1]: where that will lead but it's going

03:42:37.960 --> 03:42:39.960
[Guest 1]: to be, so Shahid and I are both very excited by it at the

03:42:39.960 --> 03:42:41.960
[Guest 2]: moment. So I

03:42:41.960 --> 03:42:43.960
[Guest 2]: also kind

03:42:43.960 --> 03:42:45.960
[Guest 2]: of interacted with a lot of scientists

03:42:45.960 --> 03:42:47.960
[Guest 2]: in that company that I am invested in called

03:42:47.960 --> 03:42:49.960
[Guest 2]: Genepath Diagnostics and these are

03:42:49.960 --> 03:42:51.960
[Guest 2]: mostly geneticists,

03:42:51.960 --> 03:42:53.960
[Guest 2]: so they typically

03:42:53.960 --> 03:42:55.960
[Guest 2]: avoid answering these questions because they

03:42:55.960 --> 03:42:57.960
[Guest 2]: are into pure science, right, they are

03:42:57.960 --> 03:42:59.960
[Guest 2]: into solving medical problems

03:42:59.960 --> 03:43:01.960
[Guest 2]: at the moment, saying that hey, how do you

03:43:01.960 --> 03:43:03.960
[Guest 2]: detect blood cancers, how do you

03:43:03.960 --> 03:43:05.960
[Guest 2]: solve the problem of spinal muscular atrophy

03:43:05.960 --> 03:43:07.960
[Guest 2]: in Turkey where we've got a great deal

03:43:07.960 --> 03:43:09.960
[Guest 2]: where the Turkish government believes that

03:43:09.960 --> 03:43:11.960
[Guest 2]: the amount of money that you are

03:43:11.960 --> 03:43:13.960
[Guest 2]: going to spend in curing patients

03:43:13.960 --> 03:43:15.960
[Guest 2]: will be far higher

03:43:15.960 --> 03:43:17.960
[Guest 2]: than money you will spend on

03:43:17.960 --> 03:43:19.960
[Guest 2]: diagnosing, so it makes sense that you

03:43:19.960 --> 03:43:21.960
[Guest 2]: diagnose an entire population and it might

03:43:21.960 --> 03:43:23.960
[Guest 2]: be cheaper for you to identify

03:43:23.960 --> 03:43:25.960
[Guest 2]: those patients, treat them effectively

03:43:25.960 --> 03:43:27.960
[Guest 2]: rather than doing a random

03:43:27.960 --> 03:43:29.960
[Guest 2]: cure for a lot of people and having

03:43:29.960 --> 03:43:31.960
[Guest 2]: the insurance come into play. So

03:43:31.960 --> 03:43:33.960
[Guest 2]: what I realized after talking to them, there is

03:43:33.960 --> 03:43:35.960
[Guest 2]: a triangle,

03:43:35.960 --> 03:43:37.960
[Guest 2]: one is what Roshan talked about is stress

03:43:37.960 --> 03:43:39.960
[Guest 2]: and anxiety, it's the cause of

03:43:39.960 --> 03:43:41.960
[Guest 2]: major diseases, now that you

03:43:41.960 --> 03:43:43.960
[Guest 2]: can solve by yoga or whatever you

03:43:43.960 --> 03:43:45.960
[Guest 2]: do, breathing exercise and stuff like that.

03:43:45.960 --> 03:43:47.960
[Guest 2]: The other two components that kind

03:43:47.960 --> 03:43:49.960
[Guest 2]: of excited me and as you rightly said

03:43:49.960 --> 03:43:51.960
[Guest 2]: whether it is the Googles, whether it's the

03:43:51.960 --> 03:43:53.960
[Guest 2]: Facebooks of the world, all the big

03:43:53.960 --> 03:43:55.960
[Guest 2]: companies are trying to live for another 40 years

03:43:55.960 --> 03:43:57.960
[Guest 2]: so all their excess research in the name of

03:43:57.960 --> 03:43:59.960
[Guest 2]: hey we want to do impact work in health

03:43:59.960 --> 03:44:01.960
[Guest 2]: is basically trying to solve these problems

03:44:01.960 --> 03:44:03.960
[Guest 2]: and the two problems that I thought

03:44:03.960 --> 03:44:05.960
[Guest 2]: that resonated with me

03:44:05.960 --> 03:44:07.960
[Guest 2]: one was a field called

03:44:07.960 --> 03:44:09.960
[Guest 2]: pharmacogenomics

03:44:09.960 --> 03:44:11.960
[Guest 2]: and the other field was

03:44:11.960 --> 03:44:13.960
[Guest 2]: basically

03:44:13.960 --> 03:44:15.960
[Guest 2]: slowing down degeneration of white

03:44:15.960 --> 03:44:17.960
[Guest 2]: loggers, so the pharmacogenomics

03:44:17.960 --> 03:44:19.960
[Guest 2]: is a very interesting

03:44:19.960 --> 03:44:21.960
[Guest 2]: field of play, what it essentially

03:44:21.960 --> 03:44:23.960
[Guest 2]: says is that suppose

03:44:23.960 --> 03:44:25.960
[Guest 2]: you use a certain statin or

03:44:25.960 --> 03:44:27.960
[Guest 2]: for that you use a blood pressure medicine

03:44:27.960 --> 03:44:29.960
[Guest 2]: for your blood pressure,

03:44:29.960 --> 03:44:31.960
[Guest 2]: you have to understand that all blood

03:44:31.960 --> 03:44:33.960
[Guest 2]: pressure medicines may not work

03:44:33.960 --> 03:44:35.960
[Guest 2]: on everybody, so

03:44:35.960 --> 03:44:37.960
[Guest 2]: therefore I will do a clinical analysis

03:44:37.960 --> 03:44:39.960
[Guest 2]: of your blood

03:44:39.960 --> 03:44:41.960
[Guest 2]: sample, I will do a full analysis

03:44:41.960 --> 03:44:43.960
[Guest 2]: and I will tell you that for each of your

03:44:43.960 --> 03:44:45.960
[Guest 2]: organs or each of your

03:44:45.960 --> 03:44:47.960
[Guest 2]: medical problems, these are

03:44:47.960 --> 03:44:49.960
[Guest 2]: the set of medicines that you should be taking

03:44:49.960 --> 03:44:51.960
[Guest 2]: and the effectiveness

03:44:51.960 --> 03:44:53.960
[Guest 2]: of the medicine on your body

03:44:53.960 --> 03:44:55.960
[Guest 1]: is post-genetic, tailored to your genes

03:44:55.960 --> 03:44:57.960
[Guest 2]: and that I have seen with

03:44:57.960 --> 03:44:59.960
[Guest 2]: a promoter, Dr. Nikhil

03:44:59.960 --> 03:45:01.960
[Guest 2]: Zakarda's father, his father was diagnosed

03:45:01.960 --> 03:45:03.960
[Guest 2]: with fourth stage cancer

03:45:03.960 --> 03:45:05.960
[Guest 2]: and nothing was

03:45:05.960 --> 03:45:07.960
[Guest 2]: working and unfortunately in Indian

03:45:07.960 --> 03:45:09.960
[Guest 2]: system it's more about cure,

03:45:09.960 --> 03:45:11.960
[Guest 2]: sometimes beyond

03:45:11.960 --> 03:45:13.960
[Guest 2]: the realm of cure, you

03:45:13.960 --> 03:45:15.960
[Guest 2]: don't go into alternate solving

03:45:15.960 --> 03:45:17.960
[Guest 2]: problem solving

03:45:17.960 --> 03:45:19.960
[Guest 2]: so he went and spoke to a company

03:45:19.960 --> 03:45:21.960
[Guest 2]: in the US and they said that

03:45:21.960 --> 03:45:23.960
[Guest 2]: the best way to treat this is to kind of find

03:45:23.960 --> 03:45:25.960
[Guest 2]: out which medicines work more

03:45:25.960 --> 03:45:27.960
[Guest 2]: effectively on him, they did an entire

03:45:27.960 --> 03:45:29.960
[Guest 2]: pharmacogenomics genetic study on

03:45:29.960 --> 03:45:31.960
[Guest 2]: him and they realized that two basic

03:45:31.960 --> 03:45:33.960
[Guest 2]: problems which are not cancer related

03:45:33.960 --> 03:45:35.960
[Guest 2]: they changed the medicines

03:45:35.960 --> 03:45:37.960
[Guest 2]: and he got better and how

03:45:37.960 --> 03:45:39.960
[Guest 2]: so the moral of the story is

03:45:39.960 --> 03:45:41.960
[Guest 2]: that there will be

03:45:41.960 --> 03:45:43.960
[Guest 2]: customized medicine in the future

03:45:43.960 --> 03:45:45.960
[Guest 2]: and the moment customized medicine happens

03:45:45.960 --> 03:45:47.960
[Guest 2]: you're automatically making it

03:45:47.960 --> 03:45:49.960
[Unknown]: you're increasing your age by 10%

03:45:49.960 --> 03:45:51.960
[Guest 2]: so all your diseases

03:45:51.960 --> 03:45:53.960
[Guest 2]: or medicines that you're going to take after the age

03:45:53.960 --> 03:45:55.960
[Guest 2]: of 50 or whatever were statins

03:45:55.960 --> 03:45:57.960
[Guest 2]: whether it is diabetic medicines, you are automatically

03:45:57.960 --> 03:45:59.960
[Guest 2]: increasing by 10%

03:45:59.960 --> 03:46:01.960
[Guest 2]: so if you're 80, you've already gone to 90 to some extent

03:46:01.960 --> 03:46:03.960
[Guest 2]: the third part of it is

03:46:03.960 --> 03:46:05.960
[Guest 2]: very interesting, he's saying that

03:46:05.960 --> 03:46:07.960
[Guest 2]: if there are 6 or 7 vital

03:46:07.960 --> 03:46:09.960
[Guest 2]: organs, I don't remember how many we have

03:46:09.960 --> 03:46:11.960
[Guest 2]: but if you identify

03:46:11.960 --> 03:46:13.960
[Guest 2]: a weak spot, so for example

03:46:13.960 --> 03:46:15.960
[Guest 2]: sugar is your problem

03:46:15.960 --> 03:46:17.960
[Guest 2]: two of the biggest killers as we all know

03:46:17.960 --> 03:46:19.960
[Guest 2]: is sugar and salt

03:46:19.960 --> 03:46:21.960
[Guest 2]: and it's obviously coming from a point that

03:46:21.960 --> 03:46:23.960
[Guest 2]: our brains are still wired millions of years

03:46:23.960 --> 03:46:25.960
[Guest 2]: ago but our technology has enabled

03:46:25.960 --> 03:46:27.960
[Guest 2]: us to not adapt from a

03:46:27.960 --> 03:46:29.960
[Guest 2]: physical condition and therefore

03:46:29.960 --> 03:46:31.960
[Guest 2]: we human beings have created

03:46:31.960 --> 03:46:33.960
[Guest 2]: n number of sugary

03:46:33.960 --> 03:46:35.960
[Guest 2]: foods and salty foods

03:46:35.960 --> 03:46:37.960
[Guest 2]: which kind of up our dopamine

03:46:37.960 --> 03:46:39.960
[Guest 2]: levels but we have to understand

03:46:39.960 --> 03:46:41.960
[Guest 2]: that we got all

03:46:41.960 --> 03:46:43.960
[Guest 2]: of this through the forest through only

03:46:43.960 --> 03:46:45.960
[Guest 2]: one discovery of a little honey

03:46:45.960 --> 03:46:47.960
[Guest 2]: in one month's time so

03:46:47.960 --> 03:46:49.960
[Guest 2]: we stored all this salts and

03:46:49.960 --> 03:46:51.960
[Guest 2]: fats and now we are getting it

03:46:51.960 --> 03:46:53.960
[Guest 2]: in huge quantities and therefore that's

03:46:53.960 --> 03:46:55.960
[Guest 2]: causing the degeneration so what do you do

03:46:55.960 --> 03:46:57.960
[Guest 2]: you identify suppose your weak link is

03:46:57.960 --> 03:46:59.960
[Guest 2]: heart or your

03:46:59.960 --> 03:47:01.960
[Guest 2]: weak link is liver then

03:47:01.960 --> 03:47:03.960
[Guest 2]: you make sure that all your

03:47:03.960 --> 03:47:05.960
[Guest 2]: degenerative organs are treated

03:47:05.960 --> 03:47:07.960
[Guest 2]: in such a way using

03:47:07.960 --> 03:47:09.960
[Guest 2]: even to the extent of bio

03:47:09.960 --> 03:47:11.960
[Guest 2]: hacks as well

03:47:11.960 --> 03:47:13.960
[Guest 2]: as bionic

03:47:13.960 --> 03:47:15.960
[Guest 2]: I mean injectables

03:47:15.960 --> 03:47:17.960
[Guest 2]: and make sure that your overall

03:47:17.960 --> 03:47:19.960
[Guest 2]: degeneration stops so if you do these

03:47:19.960 --> 03:47:21.960
[Guest 2]: two things automatically in 20 years you are

03:47:21.960 --> 03:47:23.960
[Unknown]: up so apart from the fact

03:47:23.960 --> 03:47:25.960
[Unknown]: that

03:47:35.960 --> 03:47:37.960
[Guest 2]: I think they are getting there

03:47:37.960 --> 03:47:39.960
[Guest 2]: solve the problem 20% by just

03:47:39.960 --> 03:47:41.960
[Guest 2]: doing these two things and then if you have a technological

03:47:41.960 --> 03:47:43.960
[Guest 2]: breakthrough like what you are saying

03:47:43.960 --> 03:47:45.960
[Guest 2]: the two medicines or whatever

03:47:45.960 --> 03:47:47.960
[Guest 2]: what was that? NMN, Resveratrol

03:47:53.960 --> 03:47:55.960
[Unknown]: that must be why they named it

03:47:55.960 --> 03:47:57.960
[Unknown]: they must have said

03:47:59.960 --> 03:48:01.960
[Guest 1]: I must tell you

03:48:01.960 --> 03:48:03.960
[Guest 1]: they discovered that it comes from the skin of grapes

03:48:03.960 --> 03:48:05.960
[Guest 1]: so somebody said how much wine

03:48:05.960 --> 03:48:07.960
[Guest 1]: 20 years

03:48:07.960 --> 03:48:09.960
[Guest 1]: thousands of glasses will give you

03:48:09.960 --> 03:48:11.960
[Guest 2]: the amount you require

03:48:11.960 --> 03:48:13.960
[Guest 2]: but that's the problem right that if the medical industry

03:48:13.960 --> 03:48:15.960
[Unknown]: ties up with the alcohol industry

03:48:15.960 --> 03:48:17.960
[Guest 2]: I mean today if you look at the degeneration

03:48:17.960 --> 03:48:19.960
[Guest 2]: caused because of the component

03:48:19.960 --> 03:48:21.960
[Guest 2]: which is not sugar in alcohol

03:48:21.960 --> 03:48:23.960
[Guest 2]: now for example you wear the CGM

03:48:23.960 --> 03:48:25.960
[Guest 2]: your single malt doesn't cause you a spike

03:48:25.960 --> 03:48:27.960
[Amit Varma]: your gins don't cause you a spike

03:48:27.960 --> 03:48:29.960
[Amit Varma]: I was amazed

03:48:29.960 --> 03:48:31.960
[Amit Varma]: but with the tonic they will right?

03:48:31.960 --> 03:48:33.960
[Guest 2]: with a low sugar tonic

03:48:33.960 --> 03:48:35.960
[Guest 2]: exactly

03:48:35.960 --> 03:48:37.960
[Guest 2]: but that's anyway non-alcoholic right?

03:48:37.960 --> 03:48:39.960
[Guest 2]: the point is that if the degeneration is

03:48:39.960 --> 03:48:41.960
[Guest 2]: caused by the alcohol component

03:48:41.960 --> 03:48:43.960
[Guest 2]: now imagine tomorrow Google

03:48:43.960 --> 03:48:45.960
[Guest 2]: creates an antidote to the alcohol

03:48:45.960 --> 03:48:47.960
[Guest 2]: that is settling on your liver

03:48:47.960 --> 03:48:49.960
[Guest 2]: or your fat liver deposits that are happening

03:48:49.960 --> 03:48:51.960
[Amit Varma]: game changer

03:48:51.960 --> 03:48:53.960
[Amit Varma]: I will tell you what a game changer is

03:48:53.960 --> 03:48:55.960
[Amit Varma]: there is this guy Abbey Phillips who is known on twitter as a liver doctor

03:48:55.960 --> 03:48:57.960
[Amit Varma]: he recorded with me a few days ago

03:48:57.960 --> 03:48:59.960
[Amit Varma]: his episode will come out after yours

03:48:59.960 --> 03:49:01.960
[Amit Varma]: but this is not a spoiler because

03:49:01.960 --> 03:49:03.960
[Amit Varma]: what I am about to tell you is something he told me

03:49:03.960 --> 03:49:05.960
[Amit Varma]: after the conversation

03:49:05.960 --> 03:49:07.960
[Amit Varma]: so it's not part of my conversation with him

03:49:07.960 --> 03:49:09.960
[Amit Varma]: now during the conversation he mentioned that he did

03:49:09.960 --> 03:49:11.960
[Amit Varma]: the first stool transplant

03:49:11.960 --> 03:49:13.960
[Amit Varma]: in the world for liver disease

03:49:13.960 --> 03:49:15.960
[Amit Varma]: so I asked him about it after thinking

03:49:15.960 --> 03:49:17.960
[Amit Varma]: what is a funda

03:49:17.960 --> 03:49:19.960
[Amit Varma]: and the funda was he was trying to prove

03:49:19.960 --> 03:49:21.960
[Amit Varma]: like the same way people say type 2 diabetes is not reversible

03:49:21.960 --> 03:49:23.960
[Amit Varma]: even though I have reversed mine

03:49:23.960 --> 03:49:25.960
[Amit Varma]: people also say cirrhosis is not reversible

03:49:25.960 --> 03:49:27.960
[Amit Varma]: and he decided

03:49:27.960 --> 03:49:29.960
[Amit Varma]: to try and reverse it

03:49:29.960 --> 03:49:31.960
[Amit Varma]: by basically changing the bacteria

03:49:31.960 --> 03:49:33.960
[Amit Varma]: in those parts of the body

03:49:33.960 --> 03:49:35.960
[Amit Varma]: whatever they are, so they were bad bacteria

03:49:35.960 --> 03:49:37.960
[Amit Varma]: he said I will do a stool transplant

03:49:37.960 --> 03:49:39.960
[Amit Varma]: introduce good bacteria, see what happens

03:49:39.960 --> 03:49:41.960
[Unknown]: and he has published studies on this

03:49:41.960 --> 03:49:43.960
[Amit Varma]: does this happen?

03:49:43.960 --> 03:49:45.960
[Amit Varma]: let me finish, the most interesting part comes later

03:49:45.960 --> 03:49:47.960
[Amit Varma]: so he did a stool transplant

03:49:47.960 --> 03:49:49.960
[Amit Varma]: to a person who had alcoholic cirrhosis

03:49:49.960 --> 03:49:51.960
[Amit Varma]: one the cirrhosis reversed

03:49:51.960 --> 03:49:53.960
[Amit Varma]: because a good bacteria took over

03:49:53.960 --> 03:49:55.960
[Amit Varma]: that is fine, that is not incredible

03:49:55.960 --> 03:49:57.960
[Amit Varma]: that's what you would expect

03:49:57.960 --> 03:49:59.960
[Amit Varma]: the interesting part is a person stopped wanting alcohol

03:49:59.960 --> 03:50:01.960
[Amit Varma]: he stopped wanting alcohol

03:50:01.960 --> 03:50:03.960
[Amit Varma]: because his addiction pathway

03:50:03.960 --> 03:50:05.960
[Amit Varma]: or whatever the technical term is

03:50:05.960 --> 03:50:07.960
[Amit Varma]: the good bacteria

03:50:07.960 --> 03:50:09.960
[Amit Varma]: affected that as well

03:50:09.960 --> 03:50:11.960
[Amit Varma]: apparently what was happening was there was a feedback loop

03:50:11.960 --> 03:50:13.960
[Amit Varma]: between his taking all the alcohol

03:50:13.960 --> 03:50:15.960
[Amit Varma]: the bad bacteria forming

03:50:15.960 --> 03:50:17.960
[Amit Varma]: and the bad bacteria wanting him to take more alcohol

03:50:17.960 --> 03:50:19.960
[Amit Varma]: and it became a vicious circle

03:50:19.960 --> 03:50:21.960
[Amit Varma]: he changes the bacteria

03:50:21.960 --> 03:50:23.960
[Amit Varma]: you stop wanting it, so my next question to Abby

03:50:23.960 --> 03:50:25.960
[Amit Varma]: which they are really still looking into

03:50:25.960 --> 03:50:27.960
[Amit Varma]: is does this mean that suppose cirrhosis

03:50:27.960 --> 03:50:29.960
[Amit Varma]: is not there but the person

03:50:29.960 --> 03:50:31.960
[Amit Varma]: drinks a lot, can you do a stool transplant

03:50:31.960 --> 03:50:33.960
[Amit Varma]: and have him drinking less

03:50:33.960 --> 03:50:35.960
[Amit Varma]: and he said that yes that is eminently possible

03:50:35.960 --> 03:50:37.960
[Amit Varma]: that seems to be the

03:50:37.960 --> 03:50:39.960
[Amit Varma]: he has published 165 studies

03:50:39.960 --> 03:50:41.960
[Amit Varma]: including some on this

03:50:41.960 --> 03:50:43.960
[Amit Varma]: so you know science

03:50:43.960 --> 03:50:45.960
[Amit Varma]: is that way incredible

03:50:45.960 --> 03:50:47.960
[Guest 1]: you know

03:50:47.960 --> 03:50:49.960
[Guest 1]: and if you look at it

03:50:49.960 --> 03:50:51.960
[Guest 1]: there was a time

03:50:51.960 --> 03:50:53.960
[Guest 1]: when there were so many of these food shows coming

03:50:53.960 --> 03:50:55.960
[Guest 1]: and then one went down a rabbit hole

03:50:55.960 --> 03:50:57.960
[Guest 1]: and this whole thing about how the

03:50:57.960 --> 03:50:59.960
[Guest 1]: sugar industry took over and created

03:50:59.960 --> 03:51:01.960
[Guest 1]: these norms in our head

03:51:01.960 --> 03:51:03.960
[Guest 1]: of what is good and what is bad to eat

03:51:03.960 --> 03:51:05.960
[Guest 1]: I mean it has now been proven

03:51:05.960 --> 03:51:07.960
[Guest 1]: that ghee is now

03:51:07.960 --> 03:51:09.960
[Guest 1]: considered to be the best thing

03:51:09.960 --> 03:51:11.960
[Guest 1]: and we were bought up for saying don't take ghee

03:51:11.960 --> 03:51:13.960
[Guest 2]: My mom has

03:51:13.960 --> 03:51:15.960
[Guest 2]: told me so many times

03:51:15.960 --> 03:51:17.960
[Guest 2]: eat yellow only for eggs

03:51:17.960 --> 03:51:19.960
[Amit Varma]: don't eat white

03:51:19.960 --> 03:51:21.960
[Amit Varma]: no no but the actual truth is

03:51:21.960 --> 03:51:23.960
[Amit Varma]: yolk is the healthiest part of the egg

03:51:23.960 --> 03:51:25.960
[Amit Varma]: like whenever I see people having an

03:51:25.960 --> 03:51:27.960
[Guest 2]: egg white omelette I'm like

03:51:27.960 --> 03:51:29.960
[Amit Varma]: what nonsense is this

03:51:29.960 --> 03:51:31.960
[Amit Varma]: I'll tell you what I think the science

03:51:31.960 --> 03:51:33.960
[Amit Varma]: of nutrition is

03:51:33.960 --> 03:51:35.960
[Amit Varma]: people think that medical science

03:51:35.960 --> 03:51:37.960
[Amit Varma]: is in the same state of advancement

03:51:37.960 --> 03:51:39.960
[Amit Varma]: across domains

03:51:39.960 --> 03:51:41.960
[Amit Varma]: actually it is not there are parts of it

03:51:41.960 --> 03:51:43.960
[Amit Varma]: where we are not that advanced

03:51:43.960 --> 03:51:45.960
[Amit Varma]: we are not as good as understanding

03:51:45.960 --> 03:51:47.960
[Amit Varma]: pancreatic cancer as we are

03:51:47.960 --> 03:51:49.960
[Amit Varma]: at understanding prostate cancer

03:51:49.960 --> 03:51:51.960
[Amit Varma]: both of them would kill you

03:51:51.960 --> 03:51:53.960
[Amit Varma]: 2000 years ago today one of them kills you

03:51:53.960 --> 03:51:55.960
[Amit Varma]: right more or less

03:51:55.960 --> 03:51:57.960
[Amit Varma]: so I think nutrition is kind of like that

03:51:57.960 --> 03:51:59.960
[Amit Varma]: where we are discovering more but what we do know

03:51:59.960 --> 03:52:01.960
[Amit Varma]: is that the sugar lobby funded all these

03:52:01.960 --> 03:52:03.960
[Amit Varma]: studies at Harvard and elsewhere in the

03:52:03.960 --> 03:52:05.960
[Amit Varma]: 50s and 60s which demonized

03:52:05.960 --> 03:52:07.960
[Amit Varma]: fat and said sugar was fine

03:52:07.960 --> 03:52:09.960
[Amit Varma]: the American health association

03:52:09.960 --> 03:52:11.960
[Amit Varma]: or whatever the official body was brought out

03:52:11.960 --> 03:52:13.960
[Amit Varma]: a dietary guideline in 1977

03:52:13.960 --> 03:52:15.960
[Amit Varma]: and if you look at a graph of obesity

03:52:15.960 --> 03:52:17.960
[Amit Varma]: in America the graph goes up

03:52:17.960 --> 03:52:19.960
[Amit Varma]: from there it is so stark

03:52:19.960 --> 03:52:21.960
[Guest 1]: and do you know that the very first report

03:52:21.960 --> 03:52:23.960
[Guest 1]: they did talking about this either show

03:52:23.960 --> 03:52:25.960
[Guest 1]: you know about what

03:52:25.960 --> 03:52:27.960
[Guest 1]: fat does to you was a study

03:52:27.960 --> 03:52:29.960
[Guest 1]: done on three people and

03:52:29.960 --> 03:52:31.960
[Guest 1]: that was a published result saying this is

03:52:31.960 --> 03:52:33.960
[Guest 1]: a study three

03:52:33.960 --> 03:52:35.960
[Guest 1]: people like I mean just the three people

03:52:35.960 --> 03:52:37.960
[Guest 2]: in this room

03:52:37.960 --> 03:52:39.960
[Amit Varma]: it's like

03:52:39.960 --> 03:52:41.960
[Guest 1]: study

03:52:41.960 --> 03:52:43.960
[Guest 1]: you heard about that joke

03:52:43.960 --> 03:52:45.960
[Guest 1]: right that about the founder

03:52:45.960 --> 03:52:47.960
[Guest 1]: of KFC comes to the Pope and says

03:52:47.960 --> 03:52:49.960
[Guest 1]: can you just replace

03:52:49.960 --> 03:52:51.960
[Guest 1]: give us this day our daily bread for give us this day

03:52:51.960 --> 03:52:53.960
[Guest 1]: our daily chicken right and they said

03:52:53.960 --> 03:52:55.960
[Guest 1]: no no no and he said I'll cut a million dollar check

03:52:55.960 --> 03:52:57.960
[Guest 1]: and he said no no no he said we'll do a 10 million dollar check

03:52:57.960 --> 03:52:59.960
[Guest 1]: no no no a 100 million dollar check he agrees

03:52:59.960 --> 03:53:01.960
[Guest 1]: so he goes back to the congregation and says

03:53:01.960 --> 03:53:03.960
[Guest 1]: guys you know I've got to tell you

03:53:03.960 --> 03:53:05.960
[Guest 1]: we've got a 100 million check

03:53:05.960 --> 03:53:07.960
[Guest 1]: which has come in we've got to change

03:53:07.960 --> 03:53:09.960
[Guest 1]: give us this day our daily bread to give us

03:53:09.960 --> 03:53:11.960
[Guest 1]: this day our daily chicken but we've also lost

03:53:11.960 --> 03:53:13.960
[Unknown]: the modern bread account

03:53:13.960 --> 03:53:15.960
[Unknown]: yeah

03:53:15.960 --> 03:53:17.960
[Guest 1]: and I genuinely feel that the way

03:53:17.960 --> 03:53:19.960
[Guest 1]: media has

03:53:19.960 --> 03:53:21.960
[Guest 1]: manipulated minds over the

03:53:21.960 --> 03:53:23.960
[Guest 2]: years and see apart from that

03:53:23.960 --> 03:53:25.960
[Guest 2]: as I was saying before

03:53:25.960 --> 03:53:27.960
[Guest 2]: that sugar and salt was something that

03:53:27.960 --> 03:53:29.960
[Guest 2]: you stored in the past right and

03:53:29.960 --> 03:53:31.960
[Guest 2]: now the options of sugar and salt is so

03:53:31.960 --> 03:53:33.960
[Guest 2]: high and then they've used visual cues

03:53:33.960 --> 03:53:35.960
[Guest 2]: of saying slicey

03:53:35.960 --> 03:53:37.960
[Guest 2]: and this and that so your

03:53:37.960 --> 03:53:39.960
[Guest 2]: need for sugar and salt has been taken

03:53:39.960 --> 03:53:41.960
[Guest 2]: into like 100x

03:53:41.960 --> 03:53:43.960
[Guest 2]: your body is degenerating at a regular pace

03:53:43.960 --> 03:53:45.960
[Unknown]: yeah and I'll

03:53:45.960 --> 03:53:47.960
[Amit Varma]: put all these links on why

03:53:47.960 --> 03:53:49.960
[Amit Varma]: sugar is bad and fat is perfectly fine

03:53:49.960 --> 03:53:51.960
[Amit Varma]: in my show notes and I'll also have you know

03:53:51.960 --> 03:53:53.960
[Amit Varma]: that my HbA1c in July was 7.7

03:53:53.960 --> 03:53:55.960
[Amit Varma]: it is now 5.7

03:53:55.960 --> 03:53:57.960
[Unknown]: yeah

03:53:57.960 --> 03:53:59.960
[Amit Varma]: reduced with

03:53:59.960 --> 03:54:01.960
[Amit Varma]: purely with diet keto plus intermittent

03:54:01.960 --> 03:54:03.960
[Amit Varma]: fasting so any doctor who

03:54:03.960 --> 03:54:05.960
[Amit Varma]: tells you type 2 diabetes cannot be reversed

03:54:05.960 --> 03:54:07.960
[Amit Varma]: his knowledge is outdated

03:54:07.960 --> 03:54:09.960
[Amit Varma]: and he's probably over 40 and you certainly

03:54:09.960 --> 03:54:11.960
[Guest 2]: can't treat him like a quack

03:54:11.960 --> 03:54:13.960
[Guest 2]: and I must tell you that diabetologists have

03:54:13.960 --> 03:54:15.960
[Guest 2]: no idea of diet

03:54:15.960 --> 03:54:17.960
[Amit Varma]: so it's a very broad statement

03:54:17.960 --> 03:54:19.960
[Amit Varma]: because they got their medical degrees

03:54:19.960 --> 03:54:21.960
[Guest 2]: at a time where the knowledge wasn't that advanced

03:54:21.960 --> 03:54:23.960
[Guest 2]: and also the thing is that

03:54:23.960 --> 03:54:25.960
[Guest 2]: it's not in their interest to tell the patient

03:54:25.960 --> 03:54:27.960
[Unknown]: that you eat this and that

03:54:27.960 --> 03:54:29.960
[Amit Varma]: correct

03:54:29.960 --> 03:54:31.960
[Guest 2]: and the OPD system which is a

03:54:31.960 --> 03:54:33.960
[Guest 2]: flawed system I think that

03:54:33.960 --> 03:54:35.960
[Guest 2]: you're spending 15 minutes with the patient

03:54:35.960 --> 03:54:37.960
[Guest 2]: you're not understanding their lifestyle

03:54:37.960 --> 03:54:39.960
[Guest 2]: what is your HbA1c score

03:54:39.960 --> 03:54:41.960
[Guest 2]: and we're giving you medicines right

03:54:41.960 --> 03:54:43.960
[Guest 2]: but the idea of a good diabetologist is to tell you

03:54:43.960 --> 03:54:45.960
[Guest 2]: how to prevent diabetes

03:54:45.960 --> 03:54:47.960
[Guest 2]: and that requires a lot of study on the science

03:54:47.960 --> 03:54:49.960
[Guest 2]: of diet which is probably

03:54:49.960 --> 03:54:51.960
[Amit Varma]: not covered in that level

03:54:51.960 --> 03:54:53.960
[Amit Varma]: it's purely a dietary disease

03:54:53.960 --> 03:54:55.960
[Amit Varma]: and can be reversed with only diet

03:54:55.960 --> 03:54:57.960
[Amit Varma]: I stopped medication on the day that I

03:54:57.960 --> 03:54:59.960
[Unknown]: and this happened because of CGM

03:54:59.960 --> 03:55:01.960
[Unknown]: it's a game changer

03:55:01.960 --> 03:55:03.960
[Amit Varma]: and you know everyone should

03:55:03.960 --> 03:55:05.960
[Amit Varma]: everyone should understand their own body

03:55:05.960 --> 03:55:07.960
[Unknown]: and everyone should know that

03:55:07.960 --> 03:55:09.960
[Unknown]: single malt does not increase

03:55:09.960 --> 03:55:11.960
[Unknown]: sugar

03:55:11.960 --> 03:55:13.960
[Unknown]: everyone should know that

03:55:13.960 --> 03:55:15.960
[Amit Varma]: the big question is

03:55:15.960 --> 03:55:17.960
[Guest 2]: what does it do to your liver

03:55:17.960 --> 03:55:19.960
[Guest 2]: which my friend Abbey Phillips

03:55:19.960 --> 03:55:21.960
[Guest 2]: when that episode is later

03:55:21.960 --> 03:55:23.960
[Unknown]: let them discover it then

03:55:23.960 --> 03:55:25.960
[Unknown]: for 2 weeks

03:55:25.960 --> 03:55:27.960
[Amit Varma]: finish low single malt

03:55:27.960 --> 03:55:29.960
[Guest 1]: after you listen to that episode

03:55:29.960 --> 03:55:31.960
[Unknown]: and I must say

03:55:31.960 --> 03:55:33.960
[Guest 1]: that what you just reminded me of

03:55:33.960 --> 03:55:35.960
[Guest 1]: about this intermittent fasting

03:55:35.960 --> 03:55:37.960
[Guest 1]: was one of the things that David Sinclair also spoke about

03:55:37.960 --> 03:55:39.960
[Guest 1]: saying that we were used to

03:55:39.960 --> 03:55:41.960
[Guest 1]: 8 hour cycles

03:55:41.960 --> 03:55:43.960
[Guest 1]: or max 12 hours

03:55:43.960 --> 03:55:45.960
[Guest 1]: and if you notice

03:55:45.960 --> 03:55:47.960
[Guest 1]: in every religion

03:55:47.960 --> 03:55:49.960
[Guest 1]: fasting is there

03:55:49.960 --> 03:55:51.960
[Guest 1]: in every religion

03:55:51.960 --> 03:55:53.960
[Guest 1]: we left it

03:55:53.960 --> 03:55:55.960
[Guest 1]: but you just do that

03:55:55.960 --> 03:55:57.960
[Guest 1]: and I've seen

03:55:57.960 --> 03:55:59.960
[Guest 1]: Shaheen do intermittent fasting

03:55:59.960 --> 03:56:01.960
[Guest 1]: and I can just see its impact on her

03:56:01.960 --> 03:56:03.960
[Guest 2]: you say that and now you're ordering food

03:56:03.960 --> 03:56:05.960
[Amit Varma]: no I'm ordering for myself

03:56:07.960 --> 03:56:09.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean this is a big lesson

03:56:09.960 --> 03:56:11.960
[Amit Varma]: and by the way speaking on sleep I'll also link

03:56:11.960 --> 03:56:13.960
[Amit Varma]: another great book from the show notes called

03:56:13.960 --> 03:56:15.960
[Amit Varma]: why we sleep by Matthew Walker

03:56:15.960 --> 03:56:17.960
[Amit Varma]: which also opened my eyes to the importance

03:56:17.960 --> 03:56:19.960
[Amit Varma]: of sleeping well

03:56:19.960 --> 03:56:21.960
[Unknown]: which is why I fed you all the lunch that I did

03:56:21.960 --> 03:56:23.960
[Unknown]: that whether there is conversation or not

03:56:23.960 --> 03:56:25.960
[Amit Varma]: sleep will come

03:56:25.960 --> 03:56:27.960
[Amit Varma]: so

03:56:27.960 --> 03:56:29.960
[Amit Varma]: I want to ask both of you

03:56:29.960 --> 03:56:31.960
[Amit Varma]: about lessons that you've learnt in your life

03:56:31.960 --> 03:56:33.960
[Amit Varma]: because even in personal conversation

03:56:33.960 --> 03:56:35.960
[Amit Varma]: I feel like I've learnt things from you

03:56:35.960 --> 03:56:37.960
[Amit Varma]: but I'll start with you Vikram and I want to ask you about

03:56:37.960 --> 03:56:39.960
[Amit Varma]: you know earlier we spoke about how

03:56:39.960 --> 03:56:41.960
[Amit Varma]: in a sense when you

03:56:41.960 --> 03:56:43.960
[Amit Varma]: entered these cricketing circles

03:56:43.960 --> 03:56:45.960
[Amit Varma]: you were quasi part of them

03:56:45.960 --> 03:56:47.960
[Amit Varma]: in the sense you were a player yourself

03:56:47.960 --> 03:56:49.960
[Amit Varma]: you understood the game

03:56:49.960 --> 03:56:51.960
[Amit Varma]: it's just an accident of talent that you weren't

03:56:51.960 --> 03:56:53.960
[Guest 2]: in the side with Tendulkar

03:56:53.960 --> 03:56:55.960
[Guest 2]: but on the side

03:56:55.960 --> 03:56:57.960
[Amit Varma]: you just made me feel good

03:56:57.960 --> 03:56:59.960
[Amit Varma]: it's just an accident of talent

03:56:59.960 --> 03:57:01.960
[Amit Varma]: don't tell me you were as talented as him and didn't work hard

03:57:01.960 --> 03:57:03.960
[Amit Varma]: that would be sad

03:57:03.960 --> 03:57:05.960
[Amit Varma]: so tell me a little bit about

03:57:05.960 --> 03:57:07.960
[Amit Varma]: two kinds of lessons that I've heard you speak about

03:57:07.960 --> 03:57:09.960
[Amit Varma]: one is

03:57:09.960 --> 03:57:11.960
[Amit Varma]: lessons about sport itself

03:57:11.960 --> 03:57:13.960
[Amit Varma]: and the other is

03:57:13.960 --> 03:57:15.960
[Amit Varma]: lessons about life that you have then

03:57:15.960 --> 03:57:17.960
[Amit Varma]: extrapolated from those

03:57:17.960 --> 03:57:19.960
[Amit Varma]: which you felt applied to

03:57:19.960 --> 03:57:21.960
[Guest 2]: much deeper things

03:57:21.960 --> 03:57:23.960
[Guest 2]: so the life one I'll probably cover

03:57:23.960 --> 03:57:25.960
[Guest 2]: in the second part

03:57:25.960 --> 03:57:27.960
[Guest 2]: let me give you a couple of examples

03:57:27.960 --> 03:57:29.960
[Guest 2]: of a few cricketers

03:57:29.960 --> 03:57:31.960
[Guest 2]: which kind of

03:57:31.960 --> 03:57:33.960
[Guest 2]: exposed my mind to

03:57:33.960 --> 03:57:35.960
[Guest 2]: what happens when you

03:57:35.960 --> 03:57:37.960
[Guest 2]: discover yourself as a sports

03:57:37.960 --> 03:57:39.960
[Guest 2]: person and find your own path

03:57:39.960 --> 03:57:41.960
[Guest 2]: in your journey of becoming an international sports

03:57:41.960 --> 03:57:43.960
[Guest 2]: person and let me

03:57:43.960 --> 03:57:45.960
[Guest 2]: start with Virender Sehwag

03:57:45.960 --> 03:57:47.960
[Guest 2]: I had the opportunity of

03:57:47.960 --> 03:57:49.960
[Guest 2]: spending a lot of time with him

03:57:49.960 --> 03:57:51.960
[Guest 2]: in his initial years and up until now

03:57:51.960 --> 03:57:53.960
[Guest 2]: and I realised that

03:57:53.960 --> 03:57:55.960
[Guest 2]: India is full of untapped

03:57:55.960 --> 03:57:57.960
[Guest 2]: Sehwags

03:57:57.960 --> 03:57:59.960
[Guest 2]: the reason why he got tapped is because

03:57:59.960 --> 03:58:01.960
[Guest 2]: he understood himself

03:58:01.960 --> 03:58:03.960
[Guest 2]: and I'll tell you how, I remember that

03:58:03.960 --> 03:58:05.960
[Guest 2]: interview that Ravi Shastri was doing in Sri Lanka

03:58:05.960 --> 03:58:07.960
[Guest 2]: and I was hovering around there and

03:58:07.960 --> 03:58:09.960
[Guest 2]: Ravi Shastri tried to complicate

03:58:09.960 --> 03:58:11.960
[Guest 2]: Sehwag's mind by asking him technical

03:58:11.960 --> 03:58:13.960
[Guest 2]: questions in English in the post-match interview

03:58:13.960 --> 03:58:15.960
[Guest 2]: which he was doing in his initial years

03:58:15.960 --> 03:58:17.960
[Guest 2]: and he said, Sehwag, the ball

03:58:17.960 --> 03:58:19.960
[Guest 2]: was coming on to the bat, not much

03:58:19.960 --> 03:58:21.960
[Guest 2]: grass on it, whatever little grass

03:58:21.960 --> 03:58:23.960
[Guest 2]: is basically dead grass

03:58:23.960 --> 03:58:25.960
[Guest 2]: rolled on to keep the wicket together

03:58:25.960 --> 03:58:27.960
[Guest 2]: how did you gauge the bounce of the wicket

03:58:27.960 --> 03:58:29.960
[Guest 2]: and that was a fabulous innings

03:58:29.960 --> 03:58:31.960
[Guest 2]: it's nothing like that sir

03:58:31.960 --> 03:58:33.960
[Guest 2]: the ball was coming on the bat, I just hit it

03:58:33.960 --> 03:58:35.960
[Guest 2]: and when he said

03:58:35.960 --> 03:58:37.960
[Guest 2]: this, I said, this guy is

03:58:37.960 --> 03:58:39.960
[Guest 2]: special because he did not

03:58:39.960 --> 03:58:41.960
[Guest 2]: complicate the answer

03:58:41.960 --> 03:58:43.960
[Guest 2]: and he did not complicate his cricket

03:58:43.960 --> 03:58:45.960
[Guest 2]: and that's when I went

03:58:45.960 --> 03:58:47.960
[Guest 2]: to him and said, Viru

03:58:47.960 --> 03:58:49.960
[Guest 2]: what are you thinking?

03:58:49.960 --> 03:58:51.960
[Guest 2]: and he said, Sathe sir, let me tell you

03:58:51.960 --> 03:58:53.960
[Guest 2]: a couple of things that I learned

03:58:53.960 --> 03:58:55.960
[Guest 2]: and that is

03:58:55.960 --> 03:58:57.960
[Guest 2]: no matter how much homework you do

03:58:57.960 --> 03:58:59.960
[Guest 2]: how simple you want to keep the game

03:58:59.960 --> 03:59:01.960
[Guest 2]: this is the ultimate goal of life

03:59:01.960 --> 03:59:03.960
[Guest 2]: so I said, explain it to me

03:59:03.960 --> 03:59:05.960
[Guest 2]: he said, the thing is

03:59:05.960 --> 03:59:07.960
[Guest 2]: when I came to cricket, I came to become a Tendulkar

03:59:07.960 --> 03:59:09.960
[Guest 2]: and the biggest lesson of my life

03:59:09.960 --> 03:59:11.960
[Guest 2]: was when I understood

03:59:11.960 --> 03:59:13.960
[Guest 2]: that I have to find the Sehwag within me

03:59:13.960 --> 03:59:15.960
[Guest 2]: I don't want to become a Tendulkar

03:59:15.960 --> 03:59:17.960
[Guest 2]: because I was going to become a Tendulkar

03:59:17.960 --> 03:59:19.960
[Guest 2]: but that was not happening

03:59:19.960 --> 03:59:21.960
[Guest 2]: because Tendulkar's benchmark was very high

03:59:21.960 --> 03:59:23.960
[Guest 2]: and in my batting, I was trying to

03:59:23.960 --> 03:59:25.960
[Guest 2]: model around him

03:59:25.960 --> 03:59:27.960
[Guest 2]: so I thought that until I

03:59:27.960 --> 03:59:29.960
[Guest 2]: find the player within me

03:59:29.960 --> 03:59:31.960
[Guest 2]: and that time I talked to John Wright

03:59:31.960 --> 03:59:33.960
[Guest 2]: and Tendulkar and I started

03:59:33.960 --> 03:59:35.960
[Guest 2]: preferring the opening slot

03:59:35.960 --> 03:59:37.960
[Guest 2]: because I knew that

03:59:37.960 --> 03:59:39.960
[Guest 2]: game change can only happen

03:59:39.960 --> 03:59:41.960
[Guest 2]: when you dominate in the first 10 overs

03:59:41.960 --> 03:59:43.960
[Guest 2]: and see what a revolutionary idea

03:59:43.960 --> 03:59:45.960
[Guest 2]: that is right

03:59:45.960 --> 03:59:47.960
[Guest 2]: look at the modern day T20 cricket

03:59:47.960 --> 03:59:49.960
[Guest 2]: you are talking of the power play

03:59:49.960 --> 03:59:51.960
[Guest 2]: the reason England won the T20 world cup

03:59:51.960 --> 03:59:53.960
[Guest 2]: is because of Butler and Hales

03:59:53.960 --> 03:59:55.960
[Guest 2]: up the order and the reason we did not win it

03:59:55.960 --> 03:59:57.960
[Guest 2]: because your best 2 batters on top of the game

03:59:57.960 --> 03:59:59.960
[Guest 2]: were not in form

03:59:59.960 --> 04:00:01.960
[Guest 2]: so he explained to me that how this was a thought

04:00:01.960 --> 04:00:03.960
[Guest 2]: which he backed himself to do

04:00:03.960 --> 04:00:05.960
[Guest 2]: under the guidance of John Wright

04:00:05.960 --> 04:00:07.960
[Guest 2]: and there was this very funny story

04:00:07.960 --> 04:00:09.960
[Guest 2]: that he said that

04:00:09.960 --> 04:00:11.960
[Guest 2]: there are 2 types of players

04:00:11.960 --> 04:00:13.960
[Guest 2]: one who do over analysis

04:00:13.960 --> 04:00:15.960
[Guest 2]: and the other who are like me

04:00:15.960 --> 04:00:17.960
[Guest 2]: who trust their instincts

04:00:17.960 --> 04:00:19.960
[Guest 2]: he said that we were

04:00:19.960 --> 04:00:21.960
[Guest 2]: cracking Muralitharan

04:00:21.960 --> 04:00:23.960
[Guest 2]: in Sri Lanka

04:00:23.960 --> 04:00:25.960
[Guest 2]: so Sachin told me

04:00:25.960 --> 04:00:27.960
[Guest 2]: that if you see Muralitharan's thumb

04:00:27.960 --> 04:00:29.960
[Guest 2]: then you can play Muralitharan well

04:00:29.960 --> 04:00:31.960
[Guest 2]: because if the thumb is up

04:00:31.960 --> 04:00:33.960
[Guest 2]: it means that his arm has turned

04:00:33.960 --> 04:00:35.960
[Guest 2]: and it means that he will put another

04:00:35.960 --> 04:00:37.960
[Guest 2]: so Rahul Bhai said yes

04:00:37.960 --> 04:00:39.960
[Guest 2]: he played the video

04:00:39.960 --> 04:00:41.960
[Guest 2]: yes Sachin you are absolutely right

04:00:41.960 --> 04:00:43.960
[Guest 2]: like the thumb

04:00:43.960 --> 04:00:45.960
[Guest 2]: Lakshman is saying yes

04:00:45.960 --> 04:00:47.960
[Guest 2]: this is very good

04:00:47.960 --> 04:00:49.960
[Guest 2]: I told him that I cannot see anything

04:00:49.960 --> 04:00:51.960
[Guest 2]: Murali black, thumb black

04:00:51.960 --> 04:00:53.960
[Guest 2]: I did not see anything

04:00:53.960 --> 04:00:55.960
[Unknown]: he genuinely said it

04:00:55.960 --> 04:00:57.960
[Guest 2]: he said but I have decided

04:00:57.960 --> 04:00:59.960
[Guest 2]: that I do not have the thinking

04:00:59.960 --> 04:01:01.960
[Guest 2]: of Dravid Tendulkar

04:01:01.960 --> 04:01:03.960
[Guest 2]: so I will use my methodology

04:01:03.960 --> 04:01:05.960
[Guest 2]: to tackle Muralitharan

04:01:05.960 --> 04:01:07.960
[Guest 2]: so he said what did I do

04:01:07.960 --> 04:01:09.960
[Guest 2]: I said I played with Muralitharan's mind

04:01:09.960 --> 04:01:11.960
[Guest 2]: I decided that whatever Muralitharan will put

04:01:11.960 --> 04:01:13.960
[Guest 2]: in the first 8 balls

04:01:13.960 --> 04:01:15.960
[Guest 2]: I will play it in off

04:01:15.960 --> 04:01:17.960
[Guest 2]: as soon as I will back myself and play in off

04:01:17.960 --> 04:01:19.960
[Guest 2]: Muralitharan will feel that I am holding

04:01:19.960 --> 04:01:21.960
[Guest 2]: his other

04:01:21.960 --> 04:01:23.960
[Guest 2]: and he will change his trajectory

04:01:23.960 --> 04:01:25.960
[Guest 2]: and will come in normal offspin

04:01:25.960 --> 04:01:27.960
[Guest 2]: and you know that offspinner

04:01:27.960 --> 04:01:29.960
[Guest 2]: is not a bowler for me

04:01:29.960 --> 04:01:31.960
[Guest 2]: but look at the

04:01:31.960 --> 04:01:33.960
[Guest 2]: method in the madness

04:01:33.960 --> 04:01:35.960
[Guest 2]: and that is what Rahul Dravid explained to me

04:01:35.960 --> 04:01:37.960
[Guest 2]: that you have to understand that non conventional people

04:01:37.960 --> 04:01:39.960
[Guest 2]: find easier solutions

04:01:39.960 --> 04:01:41.960
[Guest 2]: but that won't work for me

04:01:41.960 --> 04:01:43.960
[Guest 2]: I and Sachin would always look deeper into the problem

04:01:43.960 --> 04:01:45.960
[Guest 2]: but to ensure that he

04:01:45.960 --> 04:01:47.960
[Guest 2]: doesn't emulate a Tendulkar and get

04:01:47.960 --> 04:01:49.960
[Guest 2]: over analytical and put

04:01:49.960 --> 04:01:51.960
[Guest 2]: himself under pressure

04:01:51.960 --> 04:01:53.960
[Guest 2]: he found a solution which was

04:01:53.960 --> 04:01:55.960
[Guest 2]: which worked for him and I thought that

04:01:55.960 --> 04:01:57.960
[Guest 2]: was a great lesson that I learnt for him

04:01:57.960 --> 04:01:59.960
[Guest 2]: that at the end of the day you may study whatever

04:01:59.960 --> 04:02:01.960
[Guest 2]: you study and understand you read books

04:02:01.960 --> 04:02:03.960
[Guest 2]: but when you have to solve

04:02:03.960 --> 04:02:05.960
[Guest 2]: a certain problem you take everything

04:02:05.960 --> 04:02:07.960
[Guest 2]: around you and then you solve it your way

04:02:07.960 --> 04:02:09.960
[Guest 2]: and I thought that was a great lesson

04:02:09.960 --> 04:02:11.960
[Guest 2]: and today many a times when you look at new

04:02:11.960 --> 04:02:13.960
[Guest 2]: players like Surya Kumar Yadav

04:02:13.960 --> 04:02:15.960
[Guest 2]: you look at

04:02:15.960 --> 04:02:17.960
[Guest 2]: David Warner in his own way

04:02:17.960 --> 04:02:19.960
[Guest 2]: you look at Joss Butler

04:02:19.960 --> 04:02:21.960
[Guest 2]: you will see a methodology of finding

04:02:21.960 --> 04:02:23.960
[Guest 2]: themselves even like David Warner

04:02:23.960 --> 04:02:25.960
[Guest 2]: publicly says that for me

04:02:25.960 --> 04:02:27.960
[Guest 2]: Viru's suggestion of going

04:02:27.960 --> 04:02:29.960
[Guest 2]: up the order and finding myself

04:02:29.960 --> 04:02:31.960
[Guest 2]: actually changed my cricket

04:02:31.960 --> 04:02:33.960
[Guest 2]: so that is one lesson I learnt

04:02:33.960 --> 04:02:35.960
[Guest 2]: from somebody like Avininder Sehwag

04:02:35.960 --> 04:02:37.960
[Guest 2]: very interesting lesson I learnt from

04:02:37.960 --> 04:02:39.960
[Guest 2]: Ricky Ponting and I think this is

04:02:39.960 --> 04:02:41.960
[Guest 2]: something that Roshan will resonate with

04:02:41.960 --> 04:02:43.960
[Guest 2]: as well because it's about

04:02:43.960 --> 04:02:45.960
[Guest 2]: perspective. I was in conversation

04:02:45.960 --> 04:02:47.960
[Guest 2]: with Ponting we were doing like a 7 city

04:02:47.960 --> 04:02:49.960
[Guest 2]: tour with ING Bank

04:02:49.960 --> 04:02:51.960
[Guest 2]: and I asked Ricky Ponting that

04:02:51.960 --> 04:02:53.960
[Guest 2]: you know I played little bit of under 19

04:02:53.960 --> 04:02:55.960
[Guest 2]: cricket and stuff like that and we never found

04:02:55.960 --> 04:02:57.960
[Guest 2]: gaps. When you are a batsman

04:02:57.960 --> 04:02:59.960
[Guest 2]: you play by instinct if it

04:02:59.960 --> 04:03:01.960
[Guest 2]: goes in a gap you take a single or

04:03:01.960 --> 04:03:03.960
[Guest 2]: you just whatever

04:03:03.960 --> 04:03:05.960
[Guest 2]: you don't take a single

04:03:05.960 --> 04:03:07.960
[Guest 2]: so he said that this is where the growth

04:03:07.960 --> 04:03:09.960
[Guest 2]: of a batsman happens

04:03:09.960 --> 04:03:11.960
[Guest 2]: explain it to me how does it happen

04:03:11.960 --> 04:03:13.960
[Guest 2]: so he said in the initial

04:03:13.960 --> 04:03:15.960
[Guest 2]: years of my batting when I came

04:03:15.960 --> 04:03:17.960
[Guest 2]: into bat I would look at the

04:03:17.960 --> 04:03:19.960
[Guest 2]: fielders and I would have

04:03:19.960 --> 04:03:21.960
[Guest 2]: these fielders in my subconscious

04:03:21.960 --> 04:03:23.960
[Guest 2]: and that would give me

04:03:23.960 --> 04:03:25.960
[Guest 2]: a framework based on

04:03:25.960 --> 04:03:27.960
[Guest 2]: how I am going to react because at the time

04:03:27.960 --> 04:03:29.960
[Guest 2]: the ball is coming at 140

04:03:29.960 --> 04:03:31.960
[Guest 2]: you are just backing what you have learned

04:03:31.960 --> 04:03:33.960
[Guest 2]: over the years but your subconscious

04:03:33.960 --> 04:03:35.960
[Guest 2]: graph that you have will

04:03:35.960 --> 04:03:37.960
[Guest 2]: give you a sense of where the ball will

04:03:37.960 --> 04:03:39.960
[Guest 2]: go. He said over a period of

04:03:39.960 --> 04:03:41.960
[Guest 2]: time I started realizing that my gaps

04:03:41.960 --> 04:03:43.960
[Guest 2]: were going down and I thought

04:03:43.960 --> 04:03:45.960
[Guest 2]: to myself what was the problem

04:03:45.960 --> 04:03:47.960
[Guest 2]: and one day it dawned to me that

04:03:47.960 --> 04:03:49.960
[Guest 2]: I needed to change my reference point

04:03:49.960 --> 04:03:51.960
[Guest 2]: so I said what is the reference

04:03:51.960 --> 04:03:53.960
[Guest 2]: point and that

04:03:53.960 --> 04:03:55.960
[Guest 2]: one sentence I thought was the most

04:03:55.960 --> 04:03:57.960
[Guest 2]: outstanding statement said by somebody

04:03:57.960 --> 04:03:59.960
[Guest 2]: he said a good batsman

04:03:59.960 --> 04:04:01.960
[Guest 2]: imprints the fielders in the

04:04:01.960 --> 04:04:03.960
[Guest 2]: subconscious a great

04:04:03.960 --> 04:04:05.960
[Guest 2]: batsman imprints the gaps

04:04:05.960 --> 04:04:07.960
[Guest 2]: the moment

04:04:07.960 --> 04:04:09.960
[Guest 2]: that reference points had become the

04:04:09.960 --> 04:04:11.960
[Guest 2]: gaps he said I started

04:04:11.960 --> 04:04:13.960
[Guest 2]: finding the gaps beautifully

04:04:13.960 --> 04:04:15.960
[Guest 2]: and I remember sharing this

04:04:15.960 --> 04:04:17.960
[Guest 2]: story in a Bajaj auto show

04:04:17.960 --> 04:04:19.960
[Guest 2]: and Rajiv Bajaj came up to me and said that

04:04:19.960 --> 04:04:21.960
[Guest 2]: Vikram this is the most profound thing I have learned

04:04:21.960 --> 04:04:23.960
[Guest 2]: in business when you look at competition

04:04:23.960 --> 04:04:25.960
[Guest 2]: you behave like the competition

04:04:25.960 --> 04:04:27.960
[Guest 2]: if you look at the need gaps of the market

04:04:27.960 --> 04:04:29.960
[Amit Varma]: you create a great product

04:04:29.960 --> 04:04:31.960
[Amit Varma]: I have a before you resume I have a

04:04:31.960 --> 04:04:33.960
[Amit Varma]: story which this reminded me of

04:04:33.960 --> 04:04:35.960
[Amit Varma]: so around the time of the second

04:04:35.960 --> 04:04:37.960
[Amit Varma]: world war there were a bunch of experts

04:04:37.960 --> 04:04:39.960
[Amit Varma]: I think in the American party or

04:04:39.960 --> 04:04:41.960
[Amit Varma]: the allied forces that put

04:04:41.960 --> 04:04:43.960
[Amit Varma]: together a bunch of experts which

04:04:43.960 --> 04:04:45.960
[Amit Varma]: was so unique that

04:04:45.960 --> 04:04:47.960
[Amit Varma]: I think at one point they said that Milton

04:04:47.960 --> 04:04:49.960
[Amit Varma]: Friedman had only there

04:04:49.960 --> 04:04:51.960
[Amit Varma]: been in a room where you know there were

04:04:51.960 --> 04:04:53.960
[Amit Varma]: two people smarter than him you know

04:04:53.960 --> 04:04:55.960
[Amit Varma]: that kind of company and one of those

04:04:55.960 --> 04:04:57.960
[Amit Varma]: guys was a guy called Abraham Wald

04:04:57.960 --> 04:04:59.960
[Amit Varma]: now Abraham Wald was given

04:04:59.960 --> 04:05:01.960
[Amit Varma]: a problem that a lot of

04:05:01.960 --> 04:05:03.960
[Amit Varma]: our planes are coming back from

04:05:03.960 --> 04:05:05.960
[Amit Varma]: the war and you know

04:05:05.960 --> 04:05:07.960
[Amit Varma]: we are losing a lot of planes but

04:05:07.960 --> 04:05:09.960
[Amit Varma]: can you look at the planes that are coming back

04:05:09.960 --> 04:05:11.960
[Unknown]: and figure out why we are losing them

04:05:11.960 --> 04:05:13.960
[Amit Varma]: where are the bullet holes and what's

04:05:13.960 --> 04:05:15.960
[Amit Varma]: happening so he looked

04:05:15.960 --> 04:05:17.960
[Amit Varma]: over the wings there are so many bullet holes

04:05:17.960 --> 04:05:19.960
[Amit Varma]: fuselage has so many bullet holes

04:05:19.960 --> 04:05:21.960
[Amit Varma]: the nose has so many bullet holes what are the problem areas

04:05:21.960 --> 04:05:23.960
[Amit Varma]: where do we need to put armor

04:05:23.960 --> 04:05:25.960
[Amit Varma]: the engine had no bullet holes

04:05:25.960 --> 04:05:27.960
[Amit Varma]: so everybody is like wings ko karte hain

04:05:27.960 --> 04:05:29.960
[Amit Varma]: fuselage ko karte hain and Wald said no engine ko karo

04:05:29.960 --> 04:05:31.960
[Amit Varma]: and they said why engine there are

04:05:31.960 --> 04:05:33.960
[Amit Varma]: no bullet holes there so he said obviously

04:05:33.960 --> 04:05:35.960
[Amit Varma]: there are no bullet holes there that means that every time

04:05:35.960 --> 04:05:37.960
[Amit Varma]: a bullet hits an engine the plane is going down

04:05:37.960 --> 04:05:39.960
[Amit Varma]: so none of them are coming back

04:05:39.960 --> 04:05:41.960
[Amit Varma]: which is also a way of sort of

04:05:41.960 --> 04:05:43.960
[Guest 2]: looking at the gaps

04:05:43.960 --> 04:05:45.960
[Guest 2]: not thinking in the way that others

04:05:45.960 --> 04:05:47.960
[Guest 2]: do

04:05:47.960 --> 04:05:49.960
[Guest 2]: and I have seen this pattern in all great

04:05:49.960 --> 04:05:51.960
[Guest 2]: writers that they see gaps

04:05:51.960 --> 04:05:53.960
[Guest 2]: and whereas others see

04:05:53.960 --> 04:05:55.960
[Guest 2]: other reference points and so

04:05:55.960 --> 04:05:57.960
[Guest 2]: during this journey talking to a ponting

04:05:57.960 --> 04:05:59.960
[Guest 2]: like you know the other great story that

04:05:59.960 --> 04:06:01.960
[Guest 2]: I heard from Glenn Magra

04:06:01.960 --> 04:06:03.960
[Guest 2]: and he's written it in his book as well

04:06:03.960 --> 04:06:05.960
[Guest 2]: and many people talk about visualization

04:06:05.960 --> 04:06:07.960
[Guest 2]: and that's where again the longevity factor

04:06:07.960 --> 04:06:09.960
[Guest 2]: also come into play that and that comes

04:06:09.960 --> 04:06:11.960
[Guest 2]: from yoga also that

04:06:11.960 --> 04:06:13.960
[Guest 2]: a good yoga teacher which normally doesn't

04:06:13.960 --> 04:06:15.960
[Guest 2]: happen you don't find a yoga teacher

04:06:15.960 --> 04:06:17.960
[Guest 2]: good yoga teacher easily they'll focus

04:06:17.960 --> 04:06:19.960
[Guest 2]: on flexibility but very few people

04:06:19.960 --> 04:06:21.960
[Guest 2]: will tell you that in the shavasana

04:06:21.960 --> 04:06:23.960
[Guest 2]: process you actually have to

04:06:23.960 --> 04:06:25.960
[Guest 2]: leave your breath from every part of

04:06:25.960 --> 04:06:27.960
[Guest 2]: your body so when you

04:06:27.960 --> 04:06:29.960
[Guest 2]: are leaving your breath during

04:06:29.960 --> 04:06:31.960
[Guest 2]: shavasana my yoga teacher

04:06:31.960 --> 04:06:33.960
[Guest 2]: would tell me now focus on

04:06:33.960 --> 04:06:35.960
[Guest 2]: the artery where

04:06:35.960 --> 04:06:37.960
[Guest 2]: the blood is flowing from and now

04:06:37.960 --> 04:06:39.960
[Guest 2]: breathe out from there which is the

04:06:39.960 --> 04:06:41.960
[Guest 2]: weakest organ you think of your body

04:06:41.960 --> 04:06:43.960
[Guest 2]: leave your breath from there

04:06:43.960 --> 04:06:45.960
[Guest 2]: so what essentially they are saying is about

04:06:45.960 --> 04:06:47.960
[Guest 2]: the act of visualization which is huge

04:06:47.960 --> 04:06:49.960
[Guest 2]: in sport right that

04:06:49.960 --> 04:06:51.960
[Guest 2]: Sachin Tendulkar jokingly used to say

04:06:51.960 --> 04:06:53.960
[Guest 2]: that many people talk about me not being able

04:06:53.960 --> 04:06:55.960
[Guest 2]: to sleep before a match he said that

04:06:55.960 --> 04:06:57.960
[Guest 2]: when I visualize a game what happens

04:06:57.960 --> 04:06:59.960
[Guest 2]: in when I'm sleeping that game

04:06:59.960 --> 04:07:01.960
[Guest 2]: is being played so

04:07:01.960 --> 04:07:03.960
[Guest 2]: I can't sleep not because I

04:07:03.960 --> 04:07:05.960
[Guest 2]: have insomnia it's because the next

04:07:05.960 --> 04:07:07.960
[Guest 2]: days I am visualizing three slips

04:07:07.960 --> 04:07:09.960
[Guest 2]: in a gully Magra bowling at 140

04:07:09.960 --> 04:07:11.960
[Guest 2]: what is the line that's why I can't sleep

04:07:11.960 --> 04:07:13.960
[Guest 2]: but that also helps me prepare better

04:07:13.960 --> 04:07:15.960
[Guest 2]: in the next game and this

04:07:15.960 --> 04:07:17.960
[Guest 2]: amazing story about Michael Phelps

04:07:17.960 --> 04:07:19.960
[Guest 2]: about visualization which is

04:07:19.960 --> 04:07:21.960
[Guest 2]: one of my favorite stories

04:07:21.960 --> 04:07:23.960
[Guest 2]: is every big

04:07:23.960 --> 04:07:25.960
[Guest 2]: session of Michael Phelps

04:07:25.960 --> 04:07:27.960
[Guest 2]: and this is a mixture between

04:07:27.960 --> 04:07:29.960
[Guest 2]: visualization and purposeful practice

04:07:29.960 --> 04:07:31.960
[Guest 2]: as you would know purposeful practice

04:07:31.960 --> 04:07:33.960
[Guest 2]: essentially means that you

04:07:33.960 --> 04:07:35.960
[Guest 2]: start practicing under pressure

04:07:35.960 --> 04:07:37.960
[Guest 2]: you do the difficult things

04:07:37.960 --> 04:07:39.960
[Guest 2]: so the great Alex Ferguson had said that many people

04:07:39.960 --> 04:07:41.960
[Guest 2]: asked me that you know why does

04:07:41.960 --> 04:07:43.960
[Guest 2]: can you score the best goals in the last

04:07:43.960 --> 04:07:45.960
[Guest 2]: 10 minutes because he said we practice for it

04:07:45.960 --> 04:07:47.960
[Guest 2]: after every session

04:07:47.960 --> 04:07:49.960
[Guest 2]: I make sure the last 10 minutes

04:07:49.960 --> 04:07:51.960
[Guest 2]: I would tell a Ryan Giggs or a David Beckham

04:07:51.960 --> 04:07:53.960
[Guest 2]: you've got 5 minutes to go you've got to score

04:07:53.960 --> 04:07:55.960
[Guest 2]: a goal only when you practice

04:07:55.960 --> 04:07:57.960
[Guest 2]: this high pressure situation you see it in

04:07:57.960 --> 04:07:59.960
[Guest 2]: the match whereas for the person who's

04:07:59.960 --> 04:08:01.960
[Guest 2]: watching arre yaar ye log solid paanch minute

04:08:01.960 --> 04:08:03.960
[Guest 2]: wa bhai iska practice kiya hua

04:08:03.960 --> 04:08:05.960
[Guest 2]: so I forget his name

04:08:05.960 --> 04:08:07.960
[Guest 2]: it is Bob Bomor who used

04:08:07.960 --> 04:08:09.960
[Guest 2]: to be the coach of Phelps he would

04:08:09.960 --> 04:08:11.960
[Guest 2]: in the last 10 minutes tell

04:08:11.960 --> 04:08:13.960
[Guest 2]: Michael Phelps to swim in the dark

04:08:13.960 --> 04:08:15.960
[Guest 2]: he would shut

04:08:15.960 --> 04:08:17.960
[Guest 2]: all the lights in the stadium

04:08:17.960 --> 04:08:19.960
[Guest 2]: and he said now you

04:08:19.960 --> 04:08:21.960
[Guest 2]: swim for half an hour or whatever

04:08:21.960 --> 04:08:23.960
[Guest 2]: in the dark and Phelps used to hate that

04:08:23.960 --> 04:08:25.960
[Guest 2]: because it used to be disorienting

04:08:25.960 --> 04:08:27.960
[Guest 2]: but what Bob Bomor was trying to do is

04:08:27.960 --> 04:08:29.960
[Guest 2]: to get Phelps a sense

04:08:29.960 --> 04:08:31.960
[Guest 2]: of how big the pool is

04:08:31.960 --> 04:08:33.960
[Guest 2]: without seeing anything

04:08:33.960 --> 04:08:35.960
[Guest 2]: and that would

04:08:35.960 --> 04:08:37.960
[Guest 2]: train his instinct to understand

04:08:37.960 --> 04:08:39.960
[Guest 2]: the pool without

04:08:39.960 --> 04:08:41.960
[Guest 2]: actually knowing anything around him

04:08:41.960 --> 04:08:43.960
[Guest 2]: it would give him a sense of how the pool

04:08:43.960 --> 04:08:45.960
[Guest 2]: works and imagine Sydney

04:08:45.960 --> 04:08:47.960
[Guest 2]: Olympics the 8th Olympic

04:08:47.960 --> 04:08:49.960
[Guest 2]: medal he was disoriented in that

04:08:49.960 --> 04:08:51.960
[Guest 2]: particular race his goggles

04:08:51.960 --> 04:08:53.960
[Guest 2]: were full of water and he did

04:08:53.960 --> 04:08:55.960
[Guest 2]: the last 50 or 70 meters

04:08:55.960 --> 04:08:57.960
[Guest 2]: or whatever without seeing

04:08:57.960 --> 04:08:59.960
[Guest 2]: and he got the gold medal

04:08:59.960 --> 04:09:01.960
[Guest 2]: so for me this

04:09:01.960 --> 04:09:03.960
[Guest 2]: is a fabulous story of purposeful

04:09:03.960 --> 04:09:05.960
[Guest 2]: practice or for that matter visualization

04:09:05.960 --> 04:09:07.960
[Guest 2]: where you actually

04:09:07.960 --> 04:09:09.960
[Guest 2]: have lived that moment 100

04:09:09.960 --> 04:09:11.960
[Guest 2]: times but for the audience

04:09:11.960 --> 04:09:13.960
[Guest 2]: it is like he couldn't see it

04:09:13.960 --> 04:09:15.960
[Guest 2]: but still he won and I think

04:09:15.960 --> 04:09:17.960
[Guest 2]: Nasir Hussain had said a very

04:09:17.960 --> 04:09:19.960
[Guest 2]: interesting story he said that visualization

04:09:19.960 --> 04:09:21.960
[Guest 2]: for me was so important that in the

04:09:21.960 --> 04:09:23.960
[Guest 2]: ashes I would even visualize

04:09:23.960 --> 04:09:25.960
[Guest 2]: what Hayden was sledging to me

04:09:27.960 --> 04:09:29.960
[Guest 2]: so that I won't be surprised in the morning

04:09:29.960 --> 04:09:31.960
[Guest 2]: and so yeah these were these

04:09:31.960 --> 04:09:33.960
[Guest 2]: small small lessons that

04:09:33.960 --> 04:09:35.960
[Guest 1]: you keep on learning and every day

04:09:35.960 --> 04:09:37.960
[Guest 1]: there is a new lesson

04:09:37.960 --> 04:09:39.960
[Amit Varma]: motivational speaker on cricket philosophy

04:09:39.960 --> 04:09:41.960
[Amit Varma]: and word

04:09:41.960 --> 04:09:43.960
[Amit Varma]: I think by telling him this story

04:09:43.960 --> 04:09:45.960
[Amit Varma]: Nasir Hussain is trolling the corporates of India

04:09:45.960 --> 04:09:47.960
[Unknown]: because he knows that he will

04:09:47.960 --> 04:09:49.960
[Unknown]: reach them

04:09:49.960 --> 04:09:51.960
[Unknown]: people will analyze in Crockter and Gamble

04:09:51.960 --> 04:09:53.960
[Guest 2]: that how

04:09:53.960 --> 04:09:55.960
[Guest 2]: this boss is going to kill me during

04:09:55.960 --> 04:09:57.960
[Guest 1]: appraisal

04:09:57.960 --> 04:09:59.960
[Guest 1]: even if you visualize it you won't feel bad

04:09:59.960 --> 04:10:01.960
[Guest 1]: when you are talking about life

04:10:01.960 --> 04:10:03.960
[Guest 1]: lessons or whatever

04:10:03.960 --> 04:10:05.960
[Guest 1]: I was listening to Sathya and I was quickly going

04:10:05.960 --> 04:10:07.960
[Guest 1]: through some of my notes

04:10:07.960 --> 04:10:09.960
[Guest 1]: my note taking thing or whatever

04:10:09.960 --> 04:10:11.960
[Guest 1]: and

04:10:11.960 --> 04:10:13.960
[Guest 1]: I genuinely feel that frankly

04:10:13.960 --> 04:10:15.960
[Guest 1]: if you look back there are some lessons that

04:10:15.960 --> 04:10:17.960
[Guest 1]: stay with you and then every day

04:10:17.960 --> 04:10:19.960
[Guest 1]: there are new lessons that you find

04:10:19.960 --> 04:10:21.960
[Guest 1]: right I mean there is a

04:10:21.960 --> 04:10:23.960
[Amit Varma]: film called the swimmers I don't know whether you have

04:10:23.960 --> 04:10:25.960
[Amit Varma]: seen it it is just

04:10:25.960 --> 04:10:27.960
[Guest 1]: brilliant

04:10:27.960 --> 04:10:29.960
[Guest 1]: real life story two Syrian

04:10:29.960 --> 04:10:31.960
[Guest 1]: girls whose father

04:10:31.960 --> 04:10:33.960
[Guest 1]: was swimming for Syria and then couldn't

04:10:33.960 --> 04:10:35.960
[Guest 1]: qualify and put these girls through and then

04:10:35.960 --> 04:10:37.960
[Guest 1]: suddenly the Syrian you know the

04:10:37.960 --> 04:10:39.960
[Guest 1]: crisis happens in Syria and the girls have to go

04:10:39.960 --> 04:10:41.960
[Guest 1]: and become refugees

04:10:41.960 --> 04:10:43.960
[Guest 1]: and whatever and you know the film has a motto

04:10:43.960 --> 04:10:45.960
[Guest 1]: I don't want to tell people more about the film because you

04:10:45.960 --> 04:10:47.960
[Guest 1]: must watch it it is brilliant and it says

04:10:47.960 --> 04:10:49.960
[Guest 1]: stay in your lane

04:10:49.960 --> 04:10:51.960
[Guest 1]: you know and swim the race

04:10:51.960 --> 04:10:53.960
[Guest 1]: so it was you know

04:10:53.960 --> 04:10:55.960
[Guest 1]: the first thing that is important is

04:10:55.960 --> 04:10:57.960
[Guest 1]: lack of focus

04:10:57.960 --> 04:10:59.960
[Guest 1]: just keep your eye

04:10:59.960 --> 04:11:01.960
[Guest 1]: on the thing and keep going or whatever

04:11:01.960 --> 04:11:03.960
[Guest 1]: and you will see how remarkably it comes out in the film

04:11:03.960 --> 04:11:05.960
[Guest 1]: or whatever you know and I just found

04:11:05.960 --> 04:11:07.960
[Guest 1]: this to be I just found everything about that film

04:11:07.960 --> 04:11:09.960
[Guest 1]: to be so beautiful and then you know me

04:11:09.960 --> 04:11:11.960
[Guest 1]: I go down rapid holes I started following both the girls

04:11:11.960 --> 04:11:13.960
[Guest 1]: whose lives it was connected with one saying

04:11:13.960 --> 04:11:15.960
[Amit Varma]: will you come to smoke and piss

04:11:15.960 --> 04:11:16.960
[Amit Varma]: I am like that

04:11:16.960 --> 04:11:17.960
[Amit Varma]: Is she coming?

04:11:17.960 --> 04:11:19.960
[Guest 1]: Well see now

04:11:19.960 --> 04:11:21.960
[Guest 1]: but I will definitely

04:11:21.960 --> 04:11:23.960
[Guest 1]: get someone of that caliber I was

04:11:23.960 --> 04:11:25.960
[Guest 1]: hoping so you know we get some international stories

04:11:25.960 --> 04:11:27.960
[Guest 1]: as well next time

04:11:27.960 --> 04:11:29.960
[Guest 1]: you know

04:11:29.960 --> 04:11:31.960
[Guest 1]: this was something that stayed

04:11:31.960 --> 04:11:33.960
[Guest 1]: I was watching this show a lot

04:11:33.960 --> 04:11:35.960
[Guest 1]: which is currently trending on Netflix

04:11:35.960 --> 04:11:37.960
[Guest 1]: I was wondering why is it trending

04:11:37.960 --> 04:11:39.960
[Guest 1]: it's a Bihar cop story it's about Diyamit Lodha

04:11:39.960 --> 04:11:41.960
[Guest 1]: you know book on

04:11:41.960 --> 04:11:43.960
[Guest 1]: killing the biggest

04:11:43.960 --> 04:11:45.960
[Guest 1]: criminal of that time and caste politics

04:11:45.960 --> 04:11:47.960
[Guest 1]: and everything else which is going on

04:11:47.960 --> 04:11:49.960
[Guest 1]: and in the beginning they were travelling in a

04:11:49.960 --> 04:11:51.960
[Guest 1]: train it's the first time he is going to Bihar

04:11:51.960 --> 04:11:53.960
[Guest 1]: there is an old couple sitting in front of him

04:11:53.960 --> 04:11:55.960
[Guest 1]: and the guy turns and says

04:11:55.960 --> 04:11:57.960
[Guest 1]: why are you going to Bihar

04:11:57.960 --> 04:11:59.960
[Guest 1]: he says to work

04:11:59.960 --> 04:12:01.960
[Guest 1]: who goes to work in Bihar

04:12:01.960 --> 04:12:03.960
[Guest 1]: and the old man turns and says

04:12:03.960 --> 04:12:05.960
[Guest 1]: sir if you are going to work there

04:12:05.960 --> 04:12:07.960
[Guest 1]: because he is an IPS officer

04:12:07.960 --> 04:12:09.960
[Guest 1]: he says in life

04:12:09.960 --> 04:12:11.960
[Guest 1]: you can do two things from Bihar

04:12:11.960 --> 04:12:13.960
[Guest 1]: either you can earn a lot of money

04:12:13.960 --> 04:12:15.960
[Guest 1]: or you can earn a lot of

04:12:15.960 --> 04:12:17.960
[Guest 1]: name and respect now you have to decide

04:12:17.960 --> 04:12:19.960
[Guest 1]: what you have to earn

04:12:19.960 --> 04:12:21.960
[Guest 1]: and you know one very

04:12:21.960 --> 04:12:23.960
[Guest 1]: old jeep ad

04:12:23.960 --> 04:12:25.960
[Guest 1]: used to have this jeep on the top of a

04:12:25.960 --> 04:12:27.960
[Guest 1]: cliff and I don't

04:12:27.960 --> 04:12:29.960
[Guest 1]: know where they were trying to make that correlation

04:12:29.960 --> 04:12:31.960
[Guest 1]: or whatever because this whole thing about spirit and

04:12:31.960 --> 04:12:33.960
[Guest 1]: blah blah blah but below that was that line which I often

04:12:33.960 --> 04:12:35.960
[Guest 1]: quote saying do not

04:12:35.960 --> 04:12:37.960
[Guest 1]: mistake your net worth for your self worth

04:12:37.960 --> 04:12:39.960
[Guest 1]: and

04:12:39.960 --> 04:12:41.960
[Guest 1]: this constant thing nowadays

04:12:41.960 --> 04:12:43.960
[Guest 1]: who made it, who made it, where it was made

04:12:43.960 --> 04:12:45.960
[Guest 1]: how much it was made, this constant

04:12:45.960 --> 04:12:47.960
[Guest 1]: following of these success metrics that are

04:12:47.960 --> 04:12:49.960
[Guest 1]: so obsessive

04:12:49.960 --> 04:12:51.960
[Guest 1]: somehow I find and I think Vikram

04:12:51.960 --> 04:12:53.960
[Guest 1]: and I and a whole bunch of our friends resonate

04:12:53.960 --> 04:12:55.960
[Guest 1]: on the fact that it is not

04:12:55.960 --> 04:12:57.960
[Guest 1]: our primary driver, I think our

04:12:57.960 --> 04:12:59.960
[Guest 1]: primary driver is a lot more about just

04:12:59.960 --> 04:13:01.960
[Guest 1]: enriching life, doing things

04:13:01.960 --> 04:13:03.960
[Guest 1]: to a very large degree

04:13:03.960 --> 04:13:05.960
[Guest 1]: one beautiful lesson that I had

04:13:05.960 --> 04:13:07.960
[Guest 1]: in life was Javed

04:13:07.960 --> 04:13:09.960
[Guest 1]: we were going to record a song for Colgate

04:13:09.960 --> 04:13:11.960
[Guest 1]: and we were crossing the Juhu

04:13:11.960 --> 04:13:13.960
[Guest 1]: flyover to go to the highway

04:13:13.960 --> 04:13:15.960
[Guest 1]: and then we had to go to film city to shoot

04:13:15.960 --> 04:13:17.960
[Guest 1]: and my son had just been born and I was very excited

04:13:17.960 --> 04:13:19.960
[Guest 1]: and I turned to him and I said that

04:13:19.960 --> 04:13:21.960
[Guest 1]: Javed sahab you know my son and I really

04:13:21.960 --> 04:13:23.960
[Guest 1]: want him to read and I really want him to study

04:13:23.960 --> 04:13:25.960
[Guest 1]: and you know he should have the right upbringing

04:13:25.960 --> 04:13:27.960
[Guest 1]: Ikhlaq hone chahiye acche, jitni

04:13:27.960 --> 04:13:29.960
[Guest 1]: mujhe Urdu aati thi main poori use kar raha tha

04:13:29.960 --> 04:13:31.960
[Guest 1]: Ikhlaq

04:13:31.960 --> 04:13:33.960
[Guest 1]: and Javed sahab just turned and said

04:13:33.960 --> 04:13:35.960
[Guest 1]: aap chahate hain woh padhe?

04:13:35.960 --> 04:13:37.960
[Guest 1]: padhiye

04:13:37.960 --> 04:13:39.960
[Guest 1]: aap chahate hain woh achhi baate kariye?

04:13:39.960 --> 04:13:41.960
[Guest 1]: achhi baate kariye?

04:13:41.960 --> 04:13:43.960
[Guest 1]: toh kehta hai

04:13:43.960 --> 04:13:45.960
[Guest 1]: bachche sheesha hote hain

04:13:45.960 --> 04:13:47.960
[Guest 1]: jo dekhte hain

04:13:47.960 --> 04:13:49.960
[Guest 1]: usi ko reflect karte hain

04:13:49.960 --> 04:13:51.960
[Guest 1]: and then he gave me

04:13:51.960 --> 04:13:53.960
[Guest 1]: multiple examples from Bollywood of people

04:13:53.960 --> 04:13:55.960
[Guest 1]: he said you know that

04:13:55.960 --> 04:13:57.960
[Guest 1]: people who did things and

04:13:57.960 --> 04:13:59.960
[Guest 1]: how it reflects

04:13:59.960 --> 04:14:01.960
[Guest 1]: and I genuinely find that

04:14:01.960 --> 04:14:03.960
[Guest 1]: do not say do

04:14:03.960 --> 04:14:05.960
[Guest 1]: and I love you like this, bias for action

04:14:05.960 --> 04:14:07.960
[Guest 1]: I keep saying this, ke karo yaar

04:14:07.960 --> 04:14:09.960
[Guest 1]: agar duniya mein kisi cheez koi cheez khalti hai

04:14:09.960 --> 04:14:11.960
[Guest 1]: toh usko badalne ke liye kuch karo

04:14:11.960 --> 04:14:13.960
[Guest 1]: agar koi cheez hai jo fulfill karna hai

04:14:13.960 --> 04:14:15.960
[Guest 1]: toh karo toh, page one

04:14:15.960 --> 04:14:17.960
[Guest 1]: toh uska complete karo

04:14:17.960 --> 04:14:19.960
[Guest 1]: don't keep it just

04:14:19.960 --> 04:14:21.960
[Guest 1]: stuck in your mind, that's one thing

04:14:21.960 --> 04:14:23.960
[Guest 1]: for sure that I keep telling people

04:14:23.960 --> 04:14:25.960
[Guest 1]: and across all

04:14:25.960 --> 04:14:27.960
[Guest 1]: the people, I mean you know

04:14:27.960 --> 04:14:29.960
[Guest 1]: Bachchan sahab was one of the first people I said I did the interview

04:14:29.960 --> 04:14:31.960
[Guest 1]: with, then I did another interview, I worked with him

04:14:31.960 --> 04:14:33.960
[Guest 1]: on one or two other projects and whatever

04:14:33.960 --> 04:14:35.960
[Guest 1]: even today everyone, there are a hundred stories

04:14:35.960 --> 04:14:37.960
[Guest 1]: about Mr. Bachchan, good, bad, all kinds

04:14:37.960 --> 04:14:39.960
[Guest 1]: but his punctuality

04:14:39.960 --> 04:14:41.960
[Guest 1]: someone everybody will even today talk of

04:14:41.960 --> 04:14:43.960
[Guest 1]: because ek work

04:14:43.960 --> 04:14:45.960
[Guest 1]: ethic hai, there are so many

04:14:45.960 --> 04:14:47.960
[Guest 1]: times that I end up going to functions and stuff

04:14:47.960 --> 04:14:49.960
[Guest 1]: and I reach on the given appointed time

04:14:49.960 --> 04:14:51.960
[Guest 1]: and I am the earliest person in the place

04:14:51.960 --> 04:14:53.960
[Guest 1]: and I am berated by everyone around saying

04:14:53.960 --> 04:14:55.960
[Guest 1]: kyun karte ho, kyun jate ho

04:14:55.960 --> 04:14:57.960
[Guest 1]: but I just find that

04:14:57.960 --> 04:14:59.960
[Guest 1]: keeping a good work ethic

04:14:59.960 --> 04:15:01.960
[Guest 1]: and a professional work ethic is a

04:15:01.960 --> 04:15:03.960
[Guest 1]: very important thing that

04:15:03.960 --> 04:15:05.960
[Guest 1]: somewhere in this jugaad, shortcut

04:15:05.960 --> 04:15:07.960
[Guest 1]: let me tell you five life hacks to do the following

04:15:07.960 --> 04:15:09.960
[Guest 1]: nahi

04:15:09.960 --> 04:15:11.960
[Guest 1]: the simplest hack in the world is

04:15:11.960 --> 04:15:13.960
[Guest 1]: put in the work, just put in the work

04:15:13.960 --> 04:15:15.960
[Guest 1]: keep putting in the work and it will

04:15:15.960 --> 04:15:17.960
[Guest 1]: ultimately

04:15:17.960 --> 04:15:19.960
[Guest 1]: bear fruit to that

04:15:19.960 --> 04:15:21.960
[Guest 1]: whatever

04:15:21.960 --> 04:15:23.960
[Guest 1]: and it's an important thing

04:15:23.960 --> 04:15:25.960
[Guest 1]: I think for people to do

04:15:25.960 --> 04:15:27.960
[Guest 1]: the other thing that

04:15:27.960 --> 04:15:29.960
[Guest 1]: I have actually now

04:15:29.960 --> 04:15:31.960
[Guest 1]: started and I think a lot of it

04:15:31.960 --> 04:15:33.960
[Guest 1]: is actually realization is

04:15:33.960 --> 04:15:35.960
[Guest 1]: Angad Daryani is this boy who I

04:15:35.960 --> 04:15:37.960
[Guest 1]: we were doing

04:15:37.960 --> 04:15:39.960
[Guest 1]: something for DRGO and we had to

04:15:39.960 --> 04:15:41.960
[Guest 1]: get a bunch of, so we do

04:15:41.960 --> 04:15:43.960
[Guest 1]: a couple of these culture immersion, so we wanted people

04:15:43.960 --> 04:15:45.960
[Guest 1]: from various fields, so Masaba came and spoke about

04:15:45.960 --> 04:15:47.960
[Guest 1]: fashion, then we had Ankur coming and

04:15:47.960 --> 04:15:49.960
[Guest 1]: talking about music and from Gully

04:15:49.960 --> 04:15:51.960
[Guest 1]: Boy to Gehraiya, I mean look at the

04:15:51.960 --> 04:15:53.960
[Guest 1]: diversity of those two albums and how he did it

04:15:53.960 --> 04:15:55.960
[Guest 1]: fabulous, we had

04:15:55.960 --> 04:15:57.960
[Guest 1]: a gender activist who came in called Durga

04:15:57.960 --> 04:15:59.960
[Guest 1]: amazing again, great conversation

04:15:59.960 --> 04:16:01.960
[Guest 1]: and then we had

04:16:01.960 --> 04:16:03.960
[Guest 1]: this boy Angad Daryani, all of

04:16:03.960 --> 04:16:05.960
[Guest 1]: 20 something and whatever and

04:16:05.960 --> 04:16:07.960
[Guest 1]: Angad has set up a company called

04:16:07.960 --> 04:16:09.960
[Guest 1]: Praan and they are actually

04:16:09.960 --> 04:16:11.960
[Guest 1]: building these large format

04:16:11.960 --> 04:16:13.960
[Guest 1]: filters which, sorry

04:16:13.960 --> 04:16:15.960
[Guest 1]: they are actually taking carbon

04:16:15.960 --> 04:16:17.960
[Guest 1]: from the atmosphere and in a filterless

04:16:17.960 --> 04:16:19.960
[Guest 1]: technology because his logic

04:16:19.960 --> 04:16:21.960
[Guest 1]: was that even creating the filter

04:16:21.960 --> 04:16:23.960
[Guest 1]: one of the biggest polluting processes

04:16:23.960 --> 04:16:25.960
[Guest 1]: is creating the filter which absorbs

04:16:25.960 --> 04:16:27.960
[Guest 1]: the carbon, so why can you not have a

04:16:27.960 --> 04:16:29.960
[Guest 1]: filterless process which he's

04:16:29.960 --> 04:16:31.960
[Guest 1]: built, a very interesting model

04:16:31.960 --> 04:16:33.960
[Guest 1]: where you don't have to pay for the machine, you pay per

04:16:33.960 --> 04:16:35.960
[Guest 1]: person per month etc and stuff

04:16:35.960 --> 04:16:37.960
[Guest 1]: now being adopted by the Tata's

04:16:37.960 --> 04:16:39.960
[Guest 1]: just today the government has taken up a lot

04:16:39.960 --> 04:16:41.960
[Guest 1]: of this and

04:16:41.960 --> 04:16:43.960
[Guest 1]: all brands wanted to know about the metaverse

04:16:43.960 --> 04:16:45.960
[Guest 1]: and what's going to happen and whatever

04:16:45.960 --> 04:16:47.960
[Guest 1]: so I turned to Angad, what about the metaverse

04:16:47.960 --> 04:16:49.960
[Guest 1]: he says let's first save

04:16:49.960 --> 04:16:51.960
[Guest 1]: the universe then let's think of the metaverse

04:16:51.960 --> 04:16:53.960
[Guest 1]: you know and I genuinely

04:16:53.960 --> 04:16:55.960
[Guest 1]: felt that

04:16:55.960 --> 04:16:57.960
[Guest 1]: this generation as I say, this generation

04:16:57.960 --> 04:16:59.960
[Guest 1]: unafraid, doers

04:16:59.960 --> 04:17:01.960
[Guest 1]: you know, really putting

04:17:01.960 --> 04:17:03.960
[Guest 1]: themselves out there and

04:17:03.960 --> 04:17:05.960
[Guest 1]: he said it in such a simple way that

04:17:05.960 --> 04:17:07.960
[Guest 1]: I just carried on that conversation for one

04:17:07.960 --> 04:17:09.960
[Guest 1]: hour, it was a beautiful

04:17:09.960 --> 04:17:11.960
[Guest 1]: immersion of knowing how they're doing it, why

04:17:11.960 --> 04:17:13.960
[Guest 1]: he's doing it and

04:17:13.960 --> 04:17:15.960
[Guest 1]: today, like two days later I turned and said

04:17:15.960 --> 04:17:17.960
[Guest 1]: anyway I can help you, I'd love to be a part

04:17:17.960 --> 04:17:19.960
[Guest 1]: I'm now invested in the company, very very small

04:17:19.960 --> 04:17:21.960
[Guest 1]: minuscule amount but I'm invested

04:17:21.960 --> 04:17:23.960
[Guest 1]: in him

04:17:23.960 --> 04:17:25.960
[Guest 1]: and that idea because that idea for

04:17:25.960 --> 04:17:27.960
[Guest 1]: me is a world changing idea, all world

04:17:27.960 --> 04:17:29.960
[Guest 1]: changing ideas will not be yours

04:17:29.960 --> 04:17:31.960
[Guest 1]: you don't need them to be

04:17:31.960 --> 04:17:33.960
[Guest 1]: but if there is somebody else doing that

04:17:33.960 --> 04:17:35.960
[Guest 1]: you can either

04:17:35.960 --> 04:17:37.960
[Guest 1]: get out of the way

04:17:37.960 --> 04:17:39.960
[Guest 1]: or you can actually push them along the way

04:17:39.960 --> 04:17:41.960
[Guest 1]: or help them along the way and I genuinely

04:17:41.960 --> 04:17:43.960
[Guest 1]: feel that that is so important to do

04:17:43.960 --> 04:17:45.960
[Guest 1]: in a hyperconnected world

04:17:45.960 --> 04:17:47.960
[Guest 1]: when nobody is unreachable, you know

04:17:47.960 --> 04:17:49.960
[Guest 1]: when we wanted to get spoken

04:17:49.960 --> 04:17:51.960
[Guest 1]: I once wrote to JK Rowling

04:17:51.960 --> 04:17:53.960
[Guest 1]: she replied, she said listen

04:17:53.960 --> 04:17:55.960
[Guest 1]: currently I'm not available but I do

04:17:55.960 --> 04:17:57.960
[Guest 1]: want to come to India, great

04:17:57.960 --> 04:17:59.960
[Guest 1]: we

04:17:59.960 --> 04:18:01.960
[Guest 1]: this thing about

04:18:01.960 --> 04:18:03.960
[Guest 1]: wishful thinking

04:18:03.960 --> 04:18:05.960
[Guest 1]: there is only one life

04:18:05.960 --> 04:18:07.960
[Guest 1]: whatever you want to do here

04:18:07.960 --> 04:18:09.960
[Guest 1]: you want to learn a hundred new things

04:18:09.960 --> 04:18:11.960
[Guest 1]: you want to, it's all

04:18:11.960 --> 04:18:13.960
[Guest 1]: available, Prasoon

04:18:13.960 --> 04:18:15.960
[Guest 1]: said something very nice at a

04:18:15.960 --> 04:18:17.960
[Guest 1]: conference that we attended, he says

04:18:17.960 --> 04:18:19.960
[Guest 1]: this generation that you have given

04:18:19.960 --> 04:18:21.960
[Guest 1]: a device in which you can do everything

04:18:21.960 --> 04:18:23.960
[Guest 1]: you can even create

04:18:23.960 --> 04:18:25.960
[Guest 1]: whatever and he gave an example

04:18:25.960 --> 04:18:27.960
[Guest 1]: of a mixtape, he says you know many of us

04:18:27.960 --> 04:18:29.960
[Guest 1]: grew up as the mixtape generation, right

04:18:29.960 --> 04:18:31.960
[Guest 1]: I used to earn money in college by recording mixtapes

04:18:31.960 --> 04:18:33.960
[Guest 1]: with voiceovers in between and

04:18:33.960 --> 04:18:35.960
[Guest 1]: poetry I used to write

04:18:35.960 --> 04:18:37.960
[Guest 1]: everybody was love-loving

04:18:37.960 --> 04:18:39.960
[Guest 1]: everyone had tears

04:18:39.960 --> 04:18:41.960
[Guest 1]: in that conversation he said, you know we used to

04:18:41.960 --> 04:18:43.960
[Guest 1]: measure the exact amount of time

04:18:43.960 --> 04:18:45.960
[Guest 1]: in that tape, 45 minutes

04:18:45.960 --> 04:18:47.960
[Guest 1]: there would be a calculation you would

04:18:47.960 --> 04:18:49.960
[Guest 1]: do of saying this song is of 8 minutes

04:18:49.960 --> 04:18:51.960
[Guest 1]: this is of 6, if we add 6 and 8

04:18:51.960 --> 04:18:53.960
[Guest 1]: and 5 and 7 then

04:18:53.960 --> 04:18:55.960
[Guest 1]: 45 will come and you would do that

04:18:55.960 --> 04:18:57.960
[Guest 1]: permutation combination and then do that recording

04:18:57.960 --> 04:18:59.960
[Guest 1]: that importance of

04:18:59.960 --> 04:19:01.960
[Guest 1]: choice and curation

04:19:01.960 --> 04:19:03.960
[Guest 1]: was so much

04:19:03.960 --> 04:19:05.960
[Guest 1]: that you curated that, you took

04:19:05.960 --> 04:19:07.960
[Guest 1]: the effort and that effort

04:19:07.960 --> 04:19:09.960
[Guest 1]: made you value that object

04:19:09.960 --> 04:19:11.960
[Guest 1]: limitless choice

04:19:11.960 --> 04:19:13.960
[Guest 1]: is killing that

04:19:13.960 --> 04:19:15.960
[Guest 1]: to a certain degree, algorithmic choices

04:19:15.960 --> 04:19:17.960
[Guest 1]: when Spotify Unwrapped came out

04:19:17.960 --> 04:19:19.960
[Guest 1]: there was a huge thing, everybody posted

04:19:19.960 --> 04:19:21.960
[Guest 1]: and then a bunch of people posted

04:19:21.960 --> 04:19:23.960
[Guest 1]: what they said, Unwrapped did not come

04:19:23.960 --> 04:19:25.960
[Guest 1]: we just said, what about natural

04:19:25.960 --> 04:19:27.960
[Guest 1]: selection, what about just going and finding something

04:19:27.960 --> 04:19:29.960
[Guest 1]: unique, what about discovering something

04:19:29.960 --> 04:19:31.960
[Guest 1]: and I am trying to do a festival around this in February

04:19:31.960 --> 04:19:33.960
[Guest 1]: next year, you know building around

04:19:33.960 --> 04:19:35.960
[Guest 1]: this entire concept

04:19:35.960 --> 04:19:37.960
[Guest 1]: but I just think that it is

04:19:37.960 --> 04:19:39.960
[Guest 1]: important and Prasoon was saying was

04:19:39.960 --> 04:19:41.960
[Guest 1]: limitless choice and the option

04:19:41.960 --> 04:19:43.960
[Guest 1]: of limitless creation

04:19:43.960 --> 04:19:45.960
[Guest 1]: he says, beside the record button

04:19:45.960 --> 04:19:47.960
[Guest 1]: there should be a bigger pause button

04:19:47.960 --> 04:19:49.960
[Guest 1]: so that you don't

04:19:49.960 --> 04:19:51.960
[Guest 1]: put up everything you think

04:19:51.960 --> 04:19:53.960
[Guest 1]: I am a little scared

04:19:53.960 --> 04:19:55.960
[Guest 1]: of the amount of

04:19:55.960 --> 04:19:57.960
[Guest 1]: problem solvers that are available

04:19:57.960 --> 04:19:59.960
[Guest 1]: on your feed of everything

04:19:59.960 --> 04:20:01.960
[Guest 1]: every well talking

04:20:01.960 --> 04:20:03.960
[Guest 1]: semi good looking person is a

04:20:03.960 --> 04:20:05.960
[Guest 1]: friend, philosopher, guide, making money

04:20:05.960 --> 04:20:07.960
[Guest 1]: when they really don't have knowledge

04:20:07.960 --> 04:20:09.960
[Guest 1]: as a base sometimes, so

04:20:09.960 --> 04:20:11.960
[Guest 1]: somewhere I think that this mass

04:20:11.960 --> 04:20:13.960
[Guest 1]: consumption, mass creation

04:20:13.960 --> 04:20:15.960
[Guest 1]: is both a solution and a

04:20:15.960 --> 04:20:17.960
[Guest 1]: problem at some level but I really feel that

04:20:17.960 --> 04:20:19.960
[Guest 1]: the world needs a lot more of curation at that level

04:20:19.960 --> 04:20:21.960
[Guest 1]: as well and before you

04:20:21.960 --> 04:20:23.960
[Guest 1]: record, before you write

04:20:23.960 --> 04:20:25.960
[Guest 1]: press that pause button and think for a bit

04:20:25.960 --> 04:20:27.960
[Amit Varma]: is an equally important bit.

04:20:27.960 --> 04:20:29.960
[Amit Varma]: So I have a couple of questions

04:20:29.960 --> 04:20:31.960
[Amit Varma]: based on that before we go back to

04:20:31.960 --> 04:20:33.960
[Amit Varma]: cricket lessons and life lessons

04:20:33.960 --> 04:20:35.960
[Amit Varma]: from Vikram, which is

04:20:35.960 --> 04:20:37.960
[Amit Varma]: number one, of course it is a great advantage

04:20:37.960 --> 04:20:39.960
[Amit Varma]: that the youth of today have

04:20:39.960 --> 04:20:41.960
[Amit Varma]: the world at their fingertips, like I was just

04:20:41.960 --> 04:20:43.960
[Amit Varma]: in the break I was telling Vikram about Robert Sipolsky's

04:20:43.960 --> 04:20:45.960
[Amit Varma]: great biology lectures on YouTube

04:20:45.960 --> 04:20:47.960
[Amit Varma]: and how we never had anything

04:20:47.960 --> 04:20:49.960
[Amit Varma]: like that at our disposal in the 80s

04:20:49.960 --> 04:20:51.960
[Amit Varma]: when we were in school and college

04:20:51.960 --> 04:20:53.960
[Amit Varma]: but the flip side is

04:20:53.960 --> 04:20:55.960
[Amit Varma]: that the mode of how you

04:20:55.960 --> 04:20:57.960
[Amit Varma]: experience a world has become

04:20:57.960 --> 04:20:59.960
[Amit Varma]: much more, sort of

04:20:59.960 --> 04:21:01.960
[Amit Varma]: much quicker and

04:21:01.960 --> 04:21:03.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, you're always

04:21:03.960 --> 04:21:05.960
[Amit Varma]: swiping, swiping, scrolling, scrolling

04:21:05.960 --> 04:21:07.960
[Amit Varma]: that's the mode, it's

04:21:07.960 --> 04:21:09.960
[Amit Varma]: in a sense made for short attention

04:21:09.960 --> 04:21:11.960
[Amit Varma]: spans, which I know of course is a cliche

04:21:11.960 --> 04:21:13.960
[Amit Varma]: and people do listen to my 7 hour episodes

04:21:13.960 --> 04:21:15.960
[Amit Varma]: so it's not all that

04:21:15.960 --> 04:21:17.960
[Amit Varma]: but a lot of how we experience a world

04:21:17.960 --> 04:21:19.960
[Amit Varma]: is in little slivers

04:21:19.960 --> 04:21:21.960
[Amit Varma]: without really going deep, like Jonathan Haidt

04:21:21.960 --> 04:21:23.960
[Amit Varma]: once spoke about how despite having all of knowledge

04:21:23.960 --> 04:21:25.960
[Amit Varma]: available to us, all of us are consuming

04:21:25.960 --> 04:21:27.960
[Amit Varma]: something that was produced in the last

04:21:27.960 --> 04:21:29.960
[Amit Varma]: three days, except those listening

04:21:29.960 --> 04:21:31.960
[Amit Varma]: to this episode because we are recording at the start

04:21:31.960 --> 04:21:33.960
[Amit Varma]: of December and it's releasing later

04:21:33.960 --> 04:21:35.960
[Amit Varma]: but you get what I'm saying

04:21:35.960 --> 04:21:37.960
[Amit Varma]: so one, there is

04:21:37.960 --> 04:21:39.960
[Amit Varma]: that because as a creator

04:21:39.960 --> 04:21:41.960
[Amit Varma]: I have, you know, in the past written about

04:21:41.960 --> 04:21:43.960
[Amit Varma]: how the form of what you're doing changes the content

04:21:43.960 --> 04:21:45.960
[Amit Varma]: changes the character, so because

04:21:45.960 --> 04:21:47.960
[Amit Varma]: I do 5 hour episodes or whatever

04:21:47.960 --> 04:21:49.960
[Amit Varma]: I have to listen better, I have to keep

04:21:49.960 --> 04:21:51.960
[Amit Varma]: my ego out of it because I'm now listening

04:21:51.960 --> 04:21:53.960
[Amit Varma]: not to respond but to understand

04:21:53.960 --> 04:21:55.960
[Amit Varma]: that makes me a better listener, that makes me more

04:21:55.960 --> 04:21:57.960
[Amit Varma]: empathetic and it makes me a different person

04:21:57.960 --> 04:21:59.960
[Amit Varma]: if I was doing 5 minute episodes

04:21:59.960 --> 04:22:01.960
[Amit Varma]: it would be very different, but that's

04:22:01.960 --> 04:22:03.960
[Amit Varma]: as a creator, but even as a consumer

04:22:03.960 --> 04:22:05.960
[Amit Varma]: I think that applies, that if every time

04:22:05.960 --> 04:22:07.960
[Amit Varma]: I was itchy and

04:22:07.960 --> 04:22:09.960
[Amit Varma]: instead of reaching for a smartphone, I picked up a book

04:22:09.960 --> 04:22:11.960
[Amit Varma]: and I read that for an hour, instead of

04:22:11.960 --> 04:22:13.960
[Amit Varma]: scrolling through Twitter and Facebook and whatever

04:22:13.960 --> 04:22:15.960
[Amit Varma]: for an hour, I think I would fundamentally

04:22:15.960 --> 04:22:17.960
[Amit Varma]: be a different person

04:22:17.960 --> 04:22:19.960
[Amit Varma]: right, so that is sort of

04:22:19.960 --> 04:22:21.960
[Amit Varma]: one question about

04:22:21.960 --> 04:22:23.960
[Amit Varma]: where the youth of today do

04:22:23.960 --> 04:22:25.960
[Amit Varma]: have something tremendous at their disposal

04:22:25.960 --> 04:22:27.960
[Amit Varma]: all the knowledge and wisdom of the world

04:22:27.960 --> 04:22:29.960
[Amit Varma]: they are also going from immediate

04:22:29.960 --> 04:22:31.960
[Amit Varma]: gratification to immediate gratification

04:22:31.960 --> 04:22:33.960
[Amit Varma]: one dopamine hit after the other

04:22:33.960 --> 04:22:35.960
[Amit Varma]: and the other thing is, earlier when you were talking

04:22:35.960 --> 04:22:37.960
[Amit Varma]: about the youth Roshan, you mentioned about how

04:22:37.960 --> 04:22:39.960
[Amit Varma]: the kids of today

04:22:39.960 --> 04:22:41.960
[Amit Varma]: are evolved in different ways and all of that

04:22:41.960 --> 04:22:43.960
[Amit Varma]: and I wonder if there is some selection

04:22:43.960 --> 04:22:45.960
[Amit Varma]: bias in that, which has to do with

04:22:45.960 --> 04:22:47.960
[Amit Varma]: essentially interacting with a certain

04:22:47.960 --> 04:22:49.960
[Amit Varma]: kind of English speaking elite in a big city

04:22:49.960 --> 04:22:51.960
[Amit Varma]: because, you know, India

04:22:51.960 --> 04:22:53.960
[Amit Varma]: is full of multitudes in that sense

04:22:53.960 --> 04:22:55.960
[Amit Varma]: and these are

04:22:55.960 --> 04:22:57.960
[Amit Varma]: multitudes who are really responding

04:22:57.960 --> 04:22:59.960
[Amit Varma]: to incentives and algorithms

04:22:59.960 --> 04:23:01.960
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that, if today there is a 15 year old

04:23:01.960 --> 04:23:03.960
[Amit Varma]: kid, he gets a video

04:23:03.960 --> 04:23:05.960
[Amit Varma]: that this has happened in Bihar

04:23:05.960 --> 04:23:07.960
[Amit Varma]: and a cow

04:23:07.960 --> 04:23:09.960
[Amit Varma]: has been mistreated or there is an attack

04:23:09.960 --> 04:23:11.960
[Amit Varma]: on a temple, and he sees one

04:23:11.960 --> 04:23:13.960
[Amit Varma]: video like that, then the algorithm

04:23:13.960 --> 04:23:15.960
[Amit Varma]: will make sure he sees more and more

04:23:15.960 --> 04:23:17.960
[Amit Varma]: like that, till everything he is getting

04:23:17.960 --> 04:23:19.960
[Amit Varma]: is from there, and the odd thing

04:23:19.960 --> 04:23:21.960
[Amit Varma]: that he might hear from somewhere else

04:23:21.960 --> 04:23:23.960
[Amit Varma]: seems to him to be completely crazy

04:23:23.960 --> 04:23:25.960
[Amit Varma]: it doesn't fit, that would be anti-national

04:23:25.960 --> 04:23:27.960
[Amit Varma]: what are you saying, you know, and

04:23:27.960 --> 04:23:29.960
[Amit Varma]: then they get drawn into those echo chambers

04:23:29.960 --> 04:23:31.960
[Amit Varma]: and those are possibly people that we

04:23:31.960 --> 04:23:33.960
[Amit Varma]: would never come across, now

04:23:33.960 --> 04:23:35.960
[Amit Varma]: both of you have travelled much more than me and you've

04:23:35.960 --> 04:23:37.960
[Amit Varma]: actively worked with young people

04:23:37.960 --> 04:23:39.960
[Amit Varma]: beyond, you know, whatever little

04:23:39.960 --> 04:23:41.960
[Amit Varma]: urban conclaves there might be

04:23:41.960 --> 04:23:43.960
[Amit Varma]: so, it's like these two questions in one

04:23:43.960 --> 04:23:45.960
[Amit Varma]: really, that what is your sense

04:23:45.960 --> 04:23:47.960
[Amit Varma]: of how the quality and texture

04:23:47.960 --> 04:23:49.960
[Amit Varma]: of our lives is being affected

04:23:49.960 --> 04:23:51.960
[Amit Varma]: by this, because I certainly think that

04:23:51.960 --> 04:23:53.960
[Amit Varma]: if I, like, sure

04:23:53.960 --> 04:23:55.960
[Amit Varma]: in the childhood, I didn't have all the

04:23:55.960 --> 04:23:57.960
[Amit Varma]: knowledge in the world available to me, but instead of reading

04:23:57.960 --> 04:23:59.960
[Amit Varma]: all the books I did, if I was scrolling

04:23:59.960 --> 04:24:01.960
[Amit Varma]: on Twitter and Insta all the time, I

04:24:01.960 --> 04:24:03.960
[Amit Varma]: think I would be a different person, and therefore

04:24:03.960 --> 04:24:05.960
[Amit Varma]: I think this generation could be a different generation

04:24:05.960 --> 04:24:07.960
[Amit Varma]: not just in terms of

04:24:07.960 --> 04:24:09.960
[Amit Varma]: you know

04:24:09.960 --> 04:24:11.960
[Guest 1]: No, so I think

04:24:11.960 --> 04:24:13.960
[Guest 1]: the

04:24:13.960 --> 04:24:15.960
[Guest 1]: fear that, oh my god, the algorithm

04:24:15.960 --> 04:24:17.960
[Guest 1]: is going to take you down a rabbit hole

04:24:17.960 --> 04:24:19.960
[Guest 1]: you know

04:24:19.960 --> 04:24:21.960
[Guest 1]: I also feel that very often

04:24:21.960 --> 04:24:23.960
[Guest 1]: our generation

04:24:23.960 --> 04:24:25.960
[Guest 1]: consumes without putting too many filters

04:24:25.960 --> 04:24:27.960
[Guest 1]: the younger lot, I must tell you

04:24:27.960 --> 04:24:29.960
[Guest 1]: the way they disguise their identity

04:24:29.960 --> 04:24:31.960
[Guest 1]: their IPs, the way they shift across

04:24:31.960 --> 04:24:33.960
[Guest 1]: platforms, the way they will use

04:24:33.960 --> 04:24:35.960
[Guest 1]: a new browser against something else

04:24:35.960 --> 04:24:37.960
[Guest 1]: because they realize this is a cleaner browser

04:24:37.960 --> 04:24:39.960
[Guest 1]: they are very aware of that identity

04:24:39.960 --> 04:24:41.960
[Guest 1]: yeah, do they still get sucked in? Of course

04:24:41.960 --> 04:24:43.960
[Amit Varma]: they do. I think the WhatsApp university

04:24:43.960 --> 04:24:45.960
[Amit Varma]: is where they actually get sucked in a lot. But I feel these are the

04:24:45.960 --> 04:24:47.960
[Amit Varma]: well-educated young people you run into

04:24:47.960 --> 04:24:49.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, outside this bubble it might

04:24:49.960 --> 04:24:51.960
[Guest 1]: not quite be like that. Yeah, yeah, so see that's what I'm saying

04:24:51.960 --> 04:24:53.960
[Guest 1]: the example I gave you of that

04:24:53.960 --> 04:24:55.960
[Guest 1]: child who was on the train who turned and said

04:24:55.960 --> 04:24:57.960
[Guest 1]: this is my browser and this is my parents'

04:24:57.960 --> 04:24:59.960
[Guest 1]: browser, right? He is

04:24:59.960 --> 04:25:01.960
[Guest 1]: aware that oh, if he is watching

04:25:01.960 --> 04:25:03.960
[Guest 1]: X or whatever, this might throw up something

04:25:03.960 --> 04:25:05.960
[Guest 1]: else. They are aware

04:25:05.960 --> 04:25:07.960
[Guest 1]: the person in the

04:25:07.960 --> 04:25:09.960
[Guest 1]: B and C town right

04:25:09.960 --> 04:25:11.960
[Guest 1]: now, I mean there's an amazing

04:25:11.960 --> 04:25:13.960
[Guest 1]: study that we were currently looking at which said that

04:25:13.960 --> 04:25:15.960
[Guest 1]: this is a generation of vertical invaders

04:25:15.960 --> 04:25:17.960
[Guest 1]: they are people who are

04:25:17.960 --> 04:25:19.960
[Guest 1]: going to, they don't want to stop for

04:25:19.960 --> 04:25:21.960
[Guest 1]: anything on the way, there is no, if this

04:25:21.960 --> 04:25:23.960
[Guest 1]: ladder is taking me too long, I'll find a new ladder

04:25:23.960 --> 04:25:25.960
[Guest 1]: I may not take a ladder, I might find a pole vault

04:25:25.960 --> 04:25:27.960
[Guest 1]: and I'll figure my own way up there

04:25:27.960 --> 04:25:29.960
[Guest 1]: so I think they are making their own

04:25:29.960 --> 04:25:31.960
[Guest 1]: rules, they are doing it their own way

04:25:31.960 --> 04:25:33.960
[Guest 1]: definitely yes

04:25:33.960 --> 04:25:35.960
[Guest 1]: there is the

04:25:35.960 --> 04:25:37.960
[Guest 1]: WhatsApp part is

04:25:37.960 --> 04:25:39.960
[Guest 1]: what I am scared of because I find that to

04:25:39.960 --> 04:25:41.960
[Guest 1]: be too controlled and

04:25:41.960 --> 04:25:43.960
[Guest 1]: manipulated. Twitter is really not

04:25:43.960 --> 04:25:45.960
[Guest 1]: their medium, I mean the younger lot I don't

04:25:45.960 --> 04:25:47.960
[Guest 1]: find Twitter to be their medium at all

04:25:47.960 --> 04:25:49.960
[Guest 1]: their largest consumption

04:25:49.960 --> 04:25:51.960
[Guest 1]: actually currently is

04:25:51.960 --> 04:25:53.960
[Guest 1]: on either viewing

04:25:53.960 --> 04:25:55.960
[Guest 1]: where they are viewing content so therefore they are seeing

04:25:55.960 --> 04:25:57.960
[Guest 1]: long form content, so while there is the

04:25:57.960 --> 04:25:59.960
[Guest 1]: real short form content and stuff

04:25:59.960 --> 04:26:01.960
[Guest 1]: and when I see the smaller Indian

04:26:01.960 --> 04:26:03.960
[Guest 1]: TikTok look alike

04:26:03.960 --> 04:26:05.960
[Guest 1]: I genuinely find them to be poor cousins

04:26:05.960 --> 04:26:07.960
[Guest 1]: at the moment because what that

04:26:07.960 --> 04:26:09.960
[Guest 1]: is doing is next

04:26:09.960 --> 04:26:11.960
[Guest 1]: level and there

04:26:11.960 --> 04:26:13.960
[Guest 1]: again the choices I see

04:26:13.960 --> 04:26:15.960
[Guest 1]: young people make and I am now talking other geographies

04:26:15.960 --> 04:26:17.960
[Guest 1]: as well because I travel globally as well

04:26:17.960 --> 04:26:19.960
[Guest 1]: and I interact with young people there

04:26:19.960 --> 04:26:21.960
[Guest 1]: and many of them are making choices that are very

04:26:21.960 --> 04:26:23.960
[Guest 1]: different, I mean the kindest, I saw a lot of

04:26:23.960 --> 04:26:25.960
[Guest 1]: activism happening in the Middle East which girls

04:26:25.960 --> 04:26:27.960
[Guest 1]: were doing online

04:26:27.960 --> 04:26:29.960
[Guest 1]: in smaller groups that they were building. Oh what's happening

04:26:29.960 --> 04:26:31.960
[Amit Varma]: in Iran for example. Iran right now right, I mean see

04:26:31.960 --> 04:26:33.960
[Guest 1]: today they are saying they are pulling out at morality police

04:26:33.960 --> 04:26:35.960
[Guest 1]: in its entirety, what is it

04:26:35.960 --> 04:26:37.960
[Guest 1]: I mean a week before they were saying

04:26:37.960 --> 04:26:39.960
[Guest 1]: 30,000 people would be killed, you know and

04:26:39.960 --> 04:26:41.960
[Guest 1]: it's that that I think

04:26:41.960 --> 04:26:43.960
[Guest 1]: these people are aware

04:26:43.960 --> 04:26:45.960
[Guest 1]: yes

04:26:45.960 --> 04:26:47.960
[Guest 1]: there is a propensity

04:26:47.960 --> 04:26:49.960
[Guest 1]: to, but I think their propensity to question

04:26:49.960 --> 04:26:51.960
[Guest 1]: is a lot more

04:26:51.960 --> 04:26:53.960
[Guest 1]: you know the uncle is a

04:26:53.960 --> 04:26:55.960
[Guest 1]: believer beyond whatever

04:26:55.960 --> 04:26:57.960
[Guest 1]: you know the whatsapp uncle is

04:26:57.960 --> 04:26:59.960
[Guest 1]: but I think the younger lot

04:26:59.960 --> 04:27:01.960
[Guest 1]: have a lot more of this questioning ability

04:27:01.960 --> 04:27:03.960
[Guest 1]: and I would grant them that plus

04:27:03.960 --> 04:27:05.960
[Guest 1]: their peer groups have

04:27:05.960 --> 04:27:07.960
[Guest 1]: got, yeah I mean what Nikhil said again

04:27:07.960 --> 04:27:09.960
[Guest 1]: I thought was that oh very often

04:27:09.960 --> 04:27:11.960
[Guest 1]: in the loneliness of the person they will

04:27:11.960 --> 04:27:13.960
[Guest 1]: find these people because at least they feel that they find

04:27:13.960 --> 04:27:15.960
[Guest 1]: a group but I assure you

04:27:15.960 --> 04:27:17.960
[Guest 1]: that even today universities

04:27:17.960 --> 04:27:19.960
[Guest 1]: colleges across the country

04:27:19.960 --> 04:27:21.960
[Guest 1]: the discussion which even you

04:27:21.960 --> 04:27:23.960
[Guest 1]: used to have in colleges are still alive

04:27:23.960 --> 04:27:25.960
[Guest 1]: yeah, they may get

04:27:25.960 --> 04:27:27.960
[Guest 1]: colored by a lot of this falsified

04:27:27.960 --> 04:27:29.960
[Guest 1]: information, you saw this, you heard that

04:27:29.960 --> 04:27:31.960
[Guest 1]: but at least there are still enough viewpoints

04:27:31.960 --> 04:27:33.960
[Guest 1]: that exist

04:27:33.960 --> 04:27:35.960
[Guest 1]: it's not that everyone is just thinking

04:27:35.960 --> 04:27:37.960
[Guest 1]: one particular way, what we must

04:27:37.960 --> 04:27:39.960
[Guest 1]: acknowledge is what many of your episodes

04:27:39.960 --> 04:27:41.960
[Guest 1]: have acknowledged that we have been sitting in this

04:27:41.960 --> 04:27:43.960
[Guest 1]: little belief that we are a socialist

04:27:43.960 --> 04:27:45.960
[Guest 1]: equality, egalitarian

04:27:45.960 --> 04:27:47.960
[Guest 1]: blah blah blah, secular

04:27:47.960 --> 04:27:49.960
[Guest 1]: nahi hai yaar, sach mein nahi hai

04:27:49.960 --> 04:27:51.960
[Guest 1]: and when you discover that

04:27:51.960 --> 04:27:53.960
[Guest 1]: it's a very bitter pill to swallow

04:27:53.960 --> 04:27:55.960
[Guest 1]: particularly for someone from Lucknow

04:27:55.960 --> 04:27:57.960
[Guest 1]: because you know, wo Ganga Jamuni Tehzeeb

04:27:57.960 --> 04:27:59.960
[Guest 1]: wo language ka

04:27:59.960 --> 04:28:01.960
[Guest 1]: you know that evolution of a language

04:28:01.960 --> 04:28:03.960
[Guest 1]: which is actually everyone's language today

04:28:03.960 --> 04:28:05.960
[Guest 1]: a friend of ours

04:28:05.960 --> 04:28:07.960
[Guest 1]: common friend of Sathe and I was asked to

04:28:07.960 --> 04:28:09.960
[Guest 1]: write a song for one

04:28:09.960 --> 04:28:11.960
[Guest 1]: national initiative and then was told to ask to remove

04:28:11.960 --> 04:28:13.960
[Guest 1]: Urdu words, oh my god

04:28:13.960 --> 04:28:15.960
[Guest 1]: and make it Hindi

04:28:15.960 --> 04:28:17.960
[Guest 1]: and he was so upset, he says, kaise mana sakta ho

04:28:17.960 --> 04:28:19.960
[Guest 1]: is shabd ka translation nahi exist karta

04:28:19.960 --> 04:28:21.960
[Guest 1]: aur nahi karta, toh aisi bhi

04:28:21.960 --> 04:28:23.960
[Guest 1]: cheezein ho rahi hai, par uske reaction

04:28:23.960 --> 04:28:25.960
[Guest 1]: mein bohot saare aise log hai

04:28:25.960 --> 04:28:27.960
[Guest 1]: jo ki ground level pe

04:28:27.960 --> 04:28:29.960
[Guest 1]: hazaaro aise cheezein kar rahe hain

04:28:29.960 --> 04:28:31.960
[Guest 1]: aur mujhe lagta hai ki wo pahal ho rahi hai

04:28:31.960 --> 04:28:33.960
[Guest 1]: chahe wo Josh Talks ki apne level par kar rahe ho

04:28:33.960 --> 04:28:35.960
[Guest 1]: wo apna kar rahe hain, they are building

04:28:35.960 --> 04:28:37.960
[Guest 1]: it is their TED equivalent but it is

04:28:37.960 --> 04:28:39.960
[Guest 1]: Josh Talks and it's in Hindi and it exists

04:28:39.960 --> 04:28:41.960
[Guest 1]: and it's giving you that India

04:28:41.960 --> 04:28:43.960
[Guest 1]: there is Lallantop

04:28:43.960 --> 04:28:45.960
[Guest 1]: and I'm saying all of these things

04:28:45.960 --> 04:28:47.960
[Guest 1]: TVF, yes for all that they've been

04:28:47.960 --> 04:28:49.960
[Guest 1]: through or whatever the narratives that they're coming out

04:28:49.960 --> 04:28:51.960
[Guest 1]: ek hai wo Hindustan bhi aur mujhe

04:28:51.960 --> 04:28:53.960
[Amit Varma]: abhi bhi us Hindustan pe bohot yaqeen hai

04:28:53.960 --> 04:28:55.960
[Amit Varma]: Amazing! Aur us Hindustan

04:28:55.960 --> 04:28:57.960
[Unknown]: mein cricket bhi hai

04:28:57.960 --> 04:28:59.960
[Amit Varma]: cricket bhi hai, let's go back to

04:28:59.960 --> 04:29:01.960
[Guest 2]: cricket lessons

04:29:01.960 --> 04:29:03.960
[Guest 2]: I think this was a very

04:29:03.960 --> 04:29:05.960
[Guest 2]: interesting conversation, I don't have any experience

04:29:05.960 --> 04:29:07.960
[Guest 2]: with the young people in terms of what you have

04:29:07.960 --> 04:29:09.960
[Guest 2]: but to me I put it in two

04:29:09.960 --> 04:29:11.960
[Guest 2]: buckets, one is knowledge, in terms of

04:29:11.960 --> 04:29:13.960
[Guest 2]: knowledge exposure as you said

04:29:13.960 --> 04:29:15.960
[Guest 2]: Amit, what they are learning from across

04:29:15.960 --> 04:29:17.960
[Guest 2]: domains

04:29:17.960 --> 04:29:19.960
[Guest 2]: you and me would never have got that

04:29:19.960 --> 04:29:21.960
[Guest 2]: exposure, we just did it later on

04:29:21.960 --> 04:29:23.960
[Guest 2]: we evolved into that

04:29:23.960 --> 04:29:25.960
[Guest 2]: my worry more is on the psychological aspect

04:29:25.960 --> 04:29:27.960
[Guest 2]: of it and that's when the BCD

04:29:27.960 --> 04:29:29.960
[Guest 2]: town cities come into play

04:29:29.960 --> 04:29:31.960
[Guest 2]: what is the impact on that

04:29:31.960 --> 04:29:33.960
[Guest 2]: young girl who's watching the

04:29:33.960 --> 04:29:35.960
[Guest 2]: affluent Alia Bhatt

04:29:35.960 --> 04:29:37.960
[Guest 2]: of the world putting out

04:29:37.960 --> 04:29:39.960
[Guest 2]: content and many of my child psychologist

04:29:39.960 --> 04:29:41.960
[Guest 2]: friends tell me that

04:29:41.960 --> 04:29:43.960
[Guest 2]: every time we meet a young girl

04:29:43.960 --> 04:29:45.960
[Guest 2]: who has a mental health issue

04:29:45.960 --> 04:29:47.960
[Guest 2]: we know that it's Instagram

04:29:47.960 --> 04:29:49.960
[Guest 2]: to me, I am worried

04:29:49.960 --> 04:29:51.960
[Guest 2]: I am not worried about knowledge and obviously

04:29:51.960 --> 04:29:53.960
[Guest 2]: the fact that in the

04:29:53.960 --> 04:29:55.960
[Guest 2]: scrolling, are you deep diving

04:29:55.960 --> 04:29:57.960
[Guest 2]: into the subject and are you

04:29:57.960 --> 04:29:59.960
[Guest 2]: exploring that subject in totality

04:29:59.960 --> 04:30:01.960
[Guest 2]: is something I am a little worried about

04:30:01.960 --> 04:30:03.960
[Guest 2]: but people who are interested will still

04:30:03.960 --> 04:30:05.960
[Guest 2]: carry on and do it, so I am not worried

04:30:05.960 --> 04:30:07.960
[Guest 2]: that their attention span is changing

04:30:07.960 --> 04:30:09.960
[Guest 2]: whoever wants to do it will do it

04:30:09.960 --> 04:30:11.960
[Guest 2]: but I am really worried on the psychological

04:30:11.960 --> 04:30:13.960
[Guest 2]: aspect because you see that on a daily basis

04:30:13.960 --> 04:30:15.960
[Guest 2]: and you don't want an intelligent

04:30:15.960 --> 04:30:17.960
[Guest 2]: person who has

04:30:17.960 --> 04:30:19.960
[Guest 2]: a very little emotional quotient

04:30:19.960 --> 04:30:21.960
[Guest 2]: and that combination is

04:30:21.960 --> 04:30:23.960
[Guest 2]: actually very dicey because the guy is

04:30:23.960 --> 04:30:25.960
[Guest 2]: too smart in his work but

04:30:25.960 --> 04:30:27.960
[Guest 2]: unfortunately he is not sorted here and if he is

04:30:27.960 --> 04:30:29.960
[Guest 2]: sorted at the EQ level, his output

04:30:29.960 --> 04:30:31.960
[Guest 2]: at a knowledge level will also increase

04:30:31.960 --> 04:30:33.960
[Guest 2]: and how that balance plays out is something

04:30:33.960 --> 04:30:35.960
[Guest 1]: I am not really sure. I will just add to that

04:30:35.960 --> 04:30:37.960
[Guest 1]: or whatever because you know I will tell you, pre-pandemic

04:30:37.960 --> 04:30:39.960
[Guest 1]: I used to come across a lot of people

04:30:39.960 --> 04:30:41.960
[Guest 1]: and one line which we used to use in common very often was

04:30:41.960 --> 04:30:43.960
[Guest 1]: that we know in a hyper connected

04:30:43.960 --> 04:30:45.960
[Guest 1]: world we are so deeply disconnected

04:30:45.960 --> 04:30:47.960
[Guest 1]: internally, you know and the fact

04:30:47.960 --> 04:30:49.960
[Guest 1]: is that your

04:30:49.960 --> 04:30:51.960
[Guest 1]: social dyslexics was in fact

04:30:51.960 --> 04:30:53.960
[Guest 1]: something that I used to turn and keep talking of

04:30:53.960 --> 04:30:55.960
[Guest 1]: saying that I met a boy who used to blog

04:30:55.960 --> 04:30:57.960
[Guest 1]: beautifully, write beautifully and when he came

04:30:57.960 --> 04:30:59.960
[Guest 1]: in person, he was not able to even

04:30:59.960 --> 04:31:01.960
[Guest 1]: talk properly and I thought that

04:31:01.960 --> 04:31:03.960
[Guest 1]: ultimately schools, colleges

04:31:03.960 --> 04:31:05.960
[Guest 1]: were a lot more about social

04:31:05.960 --> 04:31:07.960
[Guest 1]: behavior and understanding

04:31:07.960 --> 04:31:09.960
[Guest 1]: how to be around people

04:31:09.960 --> 04:31:11.960
[Guest 1]: and a lot of these people ultimately

04:31:11.960 --> 04:31:13.960
[Guest 1]: don't have that ability

04:31:13.960 --> 04:31:15.960
[Guest 1]: or whatever. The pandemic I

04:31:15.960 --> 04:31:17.960
[Guest 1]: think actually put a lens to even

04:31:17.960 --> 04:31:19.960
[Guest 1]: young people to realize a lot of this

04:31:19.960 --> 04:31:21.960
[Guest 1]: the behavior that we are seeing

04:31:21.960 --> 04:31:23.960
[Guest 1]: and I am going to talk of a completely different

04:31:23.960 --> 04:31:25.960
[Guest 1]: world, you know in the concert

04:31:25.960 --> 04:31:27.960
[Guest 1]: and going out space

04:31:27.960 --> 04:31:29.960
[Guest 1]: we were very worried that

04:31:29.960 --> 04:31:31.960
[Guest 1]: oh this behavior has changed

04:31:31.960 --> 04:31:33.960
[Guest 1]: people will want to do everything virtual or whatever

04:31:33.960 --> 04:31:35.960
[Guest 1]: complete rubbish. People

04:31:35.960 --> 04:31:37.960
[Guest 1]: are spending 5x of

04:31:37.960 --> 04:31:39.960
[Guest 1]: what they were spending before but they

04:31:39.960 --> 04:31:41.960
[Guest 1]: are a lot more conscious of their choice

04:31:41.960 --> 04:31:43.960
[Guest 1]: earlier they would have

04:31:43.960 --> 04:31:45.960
[Guest 1]: gone and said let's try 10 things

04:31:45.960 --> 04:31:47.960
[Guest 1]: experimentation has

04:31:47.960 --> 04:31:49.960
[Guest 1]: decreased, genre

04:31:49.960 --> 04:31:51.960
[Guest 1]: definition has become very strong

04:31:51.960 --> 04:31:53.960
[Guest 1]: I want to listen to independent music, I will go

04:31:53.960 --> 04:31:55.960
[Guest 1]: I want to listen to Daler Mehndi, I will listen to Daler Mehndi

04:31:55.960 --> 04:31:57.960
[Guest 1]: I want to listen to Mikka, I will listen to Mikka

04:31:57.960 --> 04:31:59.960
[Guest 1]: I will vote with my wallet

04:31:59.960 --> 04:32:01.960
[Guest 1]: and they are doing that

04:32:01.960 --> 04:32:03.960
[Guest 1]: and doing a lot more of that. In fact

04:32:03.960 --> 04:32:05.960
[Guest 1]: it's an under serviced market I believe

04:32:05.960 --> 04:32:07.960
[Guest 1]: and people are really stepping out

04:32:07.960 --> 04:32:09.960
[Guest 1]: because now they know

04:32:09.960 --> 04:32:11.960
[Guest 1]: they are lonely, yes

04:32:11.960 --> 04:32:13.960
[Guest 1]: but now they realize it also and I think that

04:32:13.960 --> 04:32:15.960
[Guest 1]: they are trying to do enough and more things

04:32:15.960 --> 04:32:17.960
[Guest 1]: frankly there should be a lot more things

04:32:17.960 --> 04:32:19.960
[Guest 1]: in that space for them to interact

04:32:19.960 --> 04:32:21.960
[Guest 1]: the one thing that people are not being

04:32:21.960 --> 04:32:23.960
[Guest 1]: able to handle

04:32:23.960 --> 04:32:25.960
[Guest 1]: is the empowerment

04:32:25.960 --> 04:32:27.960
[Guest 1]: of women

04:32:27.960 --> 04:32:29.960
[Guest 1]: women you know have changed

04:32:29.960 --> 04:32:31.960
[Guest 1]: that entire gender is a lot more aware

04:32:31.960 --> 04:32:33.960
[Guest 1]: they have a lot more opportunities and they are using

04:32:33.960 --> 04:32:35.960
[Guest 1]: them and that

04:32:35.960 --> 04:32:37.960
[Guest 1]: is creating a certain

04:32:37.960 --> 04:32:39.960
[Guest 1]: amount of problems where

04:32:39.960 --> 04:32:41.960
[Guest 1]: the coding of that middle class

04:32:41.960 --> 04:32:43.960
[Guest 1]: patriarchal coding or whatever and I mean Nikhil's

04:32:43.960 --> 04:32:45.960
[Guest 1]: episode says a lot of this, Mahima's episode talks a lot

04:32:45.960 --> 04:32:47.960
[Guest 1]: of this so we don't need to go into it in depth

04:32:47.960 --> 04:32:49.960
[Guest 1]: but that is where I still believe

04:32:49.960 --> 04:32:51.960
[Guest 1]: that there is a lot of friction and people

04:32:51.960 --> 04:32:53.960
[Guest 1]: they just don't know what to handle because

04:32:53.960 --> 04:32:55.960
[Guest 1]: the other definition which I really resonated

04:32:55.960 --> 04:32:57.960
[Guest 1]: with what Nikhil has said

04:32:57.960 --> 04:32:59.960
[Guest 1]: that if you want to do everything

04:32:59.960 --> 04:33:01.960
[Guest 1]: then why do I need to make that choice

04:33:01.960 --> 04:33:03.960
[Guest 1]: why do I only need to do engineering

04:33:03.960 --> 04:33:05.960
[Guest 1]: remember that whole bit which was there, I thought it was a lovely bit

04:33:05.960 --> 04:33:07.960
[Guest 1]: saying that you told me to make these choices

04:33:07.960 --> 04:33:09.960
[Guest 1]: because these were safe bets for earning

04:33:09.960 --> 04:33:11.960
[Guest 1]: but now you are also earning so why can't I make

04:33:11.960 --> 04:33:13.960
[Guest 1]: crazy killer bets or whatever

04:33:13.960 --> 04:33:15.960
[Guest 1]: the other thing I must tell you is that

04:33:15.960 --> 04:33:17.960
[Guest 1]: YouTube as the university for learning

04:33:17.960 --> 04:33:19.960
[Guest 1]: is a

04:33:19.960 --> 04:33:21.960
[Guest 1]: crazy phenomenon

04:33:21.960 --> 04:33:23.960
[Guest 1]: somebody who works with me, Siddhartha Garwal

04:33:23.960 --> 04:33:25.960
[Guest 1]: his family is in Nainital

04:33:25.960 --> 04:33:27.960
[Guest 1]: he has learnt

04:33:27.960 --> 04:33:29.960
[Guest 1]: everything

04:33:29.960 --> 04:33:31.960
[Guest 1]: on YouTube, his brother

04:33:31.960 --> 04:33:33.960
[Guest 1]: is the programming guy for

04:33:33.960 --> 04:33:35.960
[Guest 1]: Arijit Singh, learnt music

04:33:35.960 --> 04:33:37.960
[Guest 1]: on YouTube, not done a

04:33:37.960 --> 04:33:39.960
[Guest 1]: formal course but learnt everything there

04:33:39.960 --> 04:33:41.960
[Guest 1]: so for those who really

04:33:41.960 --> 04:33:43.960
[Guest 1]: want to learn, I think that this thing

04:33:43.960 --> 04:33:45.960
[Guest 1]: about the availability of choice

04:33:45.960 --> 04:33:47.960
[Guest 1]: now what is the use of it

04:33:47.960 --> 04:33:49.960
[Guest 1]: and this is where I have a problem

04:33:49.960 --> 04:33:51.960
[Guest 1]: this thing of becoming

04:33:51.960 --> 04:33:53.960
[Guest 1]: luddites or lotus eaters

04:33:53.960 --> 04:33:55.960
[Guest 1]: to a certain degree, sitting, sleeping

04:33:55.960 --> 04:33:57.960
[Guest 1]: not doing it

04:33:57.960 --> 04:33:59.960
[Guest 1]: when the first time I had gone to Kashmir

04:33:59.960 --> 04:34:01.960
[Guest 1]: just after mass communication

04:34:01.960 --> 04:34:03.960
[Guest 1]: I met one or two

04:34:03.960 --> 04:34:05.960
[Guest 1]: people who are very well known

04:34:05.960 --> 04:34:07.960
[Guest 1]: in the intellectual circles or whatever

04:34:07.960 --> 04:34:09.960
[Guest 1]: over tea and every evening I used to think

04:34:09.960 --> 04:34:11.960
[Guest 1]: that this world will change tomorrow morning

04:34:11.960 --> 04:34:13.960
[Guest 1]: but it didn't come in the morning

04:34:13.960 --> 04:34:15.960
[Guest 1]: then the next day the same discussion

04:34:15.960 --> 04:34:17.960
[Guest 1]: used to happen, then the next day

04:34:17.960 --> 04:34:19.960
[Guest 1]: it was groundhog day, they were just stuck in that cycle

04:34:19.960 --> 04:34:21.960
[Guest 1]: and that's the only place

04:34:21.960 --> 04:34:23.960
[Guest 1]: where I believe that if there is over

04:34:23.960 --> 04:34:25.960
[Guest 1]: consumption and you are just consuming and not

04:34:25.960 --> 04:34:27.960
[Guest 1]: acting, doing things

04:34:27.960 --> 04:34:29.960
[Guest 1]: that's the only

04:34:29.960 --> 04:34:31.960
[Guest 1]: thing that really worries me at some level

04:34:31.960 --> 04:34:33.960
[Guest 1]: but I have loads of faith

04:34:33.960 --> 04:34:35.960
[Guest 1]: in this generation, of course

04:34:35.960 --> 04:34:37.960
[Guest 1]: there is always friction, wasn't there friction when you were in college

04:34:37.960 --> 04:34:39.960
[Guest 1]: I came in from Lucknow and came to Delhi and

04:34:39.960 --> 04:34:41.960
[Guest 1]: suddenly I am standing and there is an SFI guy

04:34:41.960 --> 04:34:43.960
[Guest 1]: saying politics, decide your life, decide your politics

04:34:43.960 --> 04:34:45.960
[Unknown]: but I don't want to decide any politics

04:34:45.960 --> 04:34:47.960
[Guest 1]: so you have to, so let's join SFI

04:34:47.960 --> 04:34:49.960
[Guest 1]: then he said no no

04:34:49.960 --> 04:34:51.960
[Guest 1]: let's do debating, it's that

04:34:51.960 --> 04:34:53.960
[Guest 1]: and as long as

04:34:53.960 --> 04:34:55.960
[Guest 1]: that spirit of experimentation is alive

04:34:55.960 --> 04:34:57.960
[Guest 1]: there is hope

04:34:57.960 --> 04:34:59.960
[Guest 1]: and if this world doesn't exist there is always Elon Musk

04:34:59.960 --> 04:35:01.960
[Guest 1]: and Mars, let's see

04:35:01.960 --> 04:35:03.960
[Amit Varma]: and also

04:35:03.960 --> 04:35:05.960
[Amit Varma]: I think it might be a little bit of

04:35:05.960 --> 04:35:07.960
[Amit Varma]: you know nostalgia also that

04:35:07.960 --> 04:35:09.960
[Amit Varma]: in our time also most people were doing nothing

04:35:09.960 --> 04:35:11.960
[Unknown]: you know it was a few people who would

04:35:11.960 --> 04:35:13.960
[Guest 2]: take the initiative and do shit

04:35:13.960 --> 04:35:15.960
[Guest 2]: most people were doing nothing

04:35:15.960 --> 04:35:17.960
[Guest 2]: at least in this time people are consuming

04:35:17.960 --> 04:35:19.960
[Amit Varma]: yes in this time there is something

04:35:19.960 --> 04:35:21.960
[Amit Varma]: there is a chance but

04:35:21.960 --> 04:35:23.960
[Guest 1]: you know

04:35:23.960 --> 04:35:25.960
[Guest 1]: people try to say

04:35:25.960 --> 04:35:27.960
[Guest 1]: in our time

04:35:27.960 --> 04:35:29.960
[Guest 1]: after college there was theater or cricket

04:35:29.960 --> 04:35:31.960
[Guest 1]: we didn't study sports so we used to do theater

04:35:31.960 --> 04:35:33.960
[Guest 1]: for 6 hours

04:35:33.960 --> 04:35:35.960
[Guest 1]: that was our entertainment, our pool was that

04:35:35.960 --> 04:35:37.960
[Guest 1]: our bowling was that, our video

04:35:37.960 --> 04:35:39.960
[Guest 2]: market was that, we used to do everything

04:35:39.960 --> 04:35:41.960
[Guest 2]: that's why because of physical activity

04:35:41.960 --> 04:35:43.960
[Guest 2]: modern endorphins were also good

04:35:43.960 --> 04:35:45.960
[Guest 2]: that's why that aspect

04:35:45.960 --> 04:35:47.960
[Guest 2]: probably 20, 50, 100 years

04:35:47.960 --> 04:35:49.960
[Guest 2]: later they will start

04:35:49.960 --> 04:35:51.960
[Guest 2]: getting endorphins from technology

04:35:51.960 --> 04:35:53.960
[Guest 2]: we don't know but now this new

04:35:53.960 --> 04:35:55.960
[Guest 2]: creature that we have

04:35:55.960 --> 04:35:57.960
[Guest 2]: who is born on the internet

04:35:57.960 --> 04:35:59.960
[Guest 2]: or born on this device

04:35:59.960 --> 04:36:01.960
[Guest 2]: how his or her

04:36:01.960 --> 04:36:03.960
[Guest 2]: physical development will take place

04:36:03.960 --> 04:36:05.960
[Guest 2]: is I think a big challenge because when you

04:36:05.960 --> 04:36:07.960
[Guest 2]: spend 8 hours on the phone

04:36:07.960 --> 04:36:09.960
[Guest 2]: what changes will

04:36:09.960 --> 04:36:11.960
[Guest 2]: that human body have over the

04:36:11.960 --> 04:36:13.960
[Guest 2]: next 20 years is going

04:36:13.960 --> 04:36:15.960
[Guest 2]: to be a tricky one while you want to increase

04:36:15.960 --> 04:36:17.960
[Guest 2]: the lifespan to 130 years

04:36:17.960 --> 04:36:19.960
[Guest 2]: but you've played cricket

04:36:19.960 --> 04:36:21.960
[Guest 2]: you've gone out, you've trekked

04:36:21.960 --> 04:36:23.960
[Guest 2]: but imagine a generation which is not doing

04:36:23.960 --> 04:36:25.960
[Guest 2]: all of that and as you say you want everybody to

04:36:25.960 --> 04:36:27.960
[Guest 2]: do something, how will that

04:36:27.960 --> 04:36:29.960
[Guest 2]: impact their physical health

04:36:29.960 --> 04:36:31.960
[Amit Varma]: is also a challenge. So recently there was like

04:36:31.960 --> 04:36:33.960
[Amit Varma]: this when Ronaldo

04:36:33.960 --> 04:36:35.960
[Amit Varma]: gave his infamous interview, spoiled brat

04:36:35.960 --> 04:36:37.960
[Amit Varma]: useless Ronaldo who is a liability

04:36:37.960 --> 04:36:39.960
[Unknown]: to every team he's part of

04:36:39.960 --> 04:36:41.960
[Amit Varma]: gave his interview, he was complaining

04:36:41.960 --> 04:36:43.960
[Amit Varma]: about the young people in the team

04:36:43.960 --> 04:36:45.960
[Amit Varma]: and saying that in our time we used to work

04:36:45.960 --> 04:36:47.960
[Amit Varma]: a lot, we used to train a lot

04:36:47.960 --> 04:36:49.960
[Amit Varma]: and kind of saying that their whole lifestyle

04:36:49.960 --> 04:36:51.960
[Amit Varma]: was completely different and I've heard this in a

04:36:51.960 --> 04:36:53.960
[Amit Varma]: cricketing context from some Australian

04:36:53.960 --> 04:36:55.960
[Amit Varma]: player, I forget who, you must be knowing this

04:36:55.960 --> 04:36:57.960
[Amit Varma]: and must have seen it first hand

04:36:57.960 --> 04:36:59.960
[Amit Varma]: you know all the young players are now playing video

04:36:59.960 --> 04:37:01.960
[Amit Varma]: games and consoles and their

04:37:01.960 --> 04:37:03.960
[Amit Varma]: interests are completely different, the ways they bond

04:37:03.960 --> 04:37:05.960
[Amit Varma]: with each other is completely different

04:37:05.960 --> 04:37:07.960
[Amit Varma]: so do you see that in

04:37:07.960 --> 04:37:09.960
[Amit Varma]: these sports also? I think what Ronaldo's point was

04:37:09.960 --> 04:37:11.960
[Amit Varma]: they aren't hungry, they don't you know

04:37:11.960 --> 04:37:13.960
[Amit Varma]: for us it is everything, these young people

04:37:13.960 --> 04:37:15.960
[Amit Varma]: are just not hungry, they go through the motions

04:37:15.960 --> 04:37:17.960
[Amit Varma]: which is absolutely untrue

04:37:17.960 --> 04:37:19.960
[Amit Varma]: you know he's a lazy bum who sits in the box

04:37:19.960 --> 04:37:21.960
[Guest 2]: and waits for the ball, the rest of them are pressing

04:37:21.960 --> 04:37:23.960
[Guest 2]: but apart from that just as a

04:37:23.960 --> 04:37:25.960
[Guest 2]: general comment. I mean I would like to say

04:37:25.960 --> 04:37:27.960
[Guest 2]: that in the urban setup maybe

04:37:27.960 --> 04:37:29.960
[Guest 2]: okay because

04:37:29.960 --> 04:37:31.960
[Guest 2]: but as we discussed earlier

04:37:31.960 --> 04:37:33.960
[Guest 2]: the guys who want to prove something and they

04:37:33.960 --> 04:37:35.960
[Guest 2]: fire in them, they will not show

04:37:35.960 --> 04:37:37.960
[Guest 2]: such signs but yes I mean video games and all

04:37:37.960 --> 04:37:39.960
[Guest 2]: is normal for players even

04:37:39.960 --> 04:37:41.960
[Guest 2]: Dhoni's generation when they went inside

04:37:41.960 --> 04:37:43.960
[Guest 2]: they played FIFA and stuff like that but

04:37:43.960 --> 04:37:45.960
[Guest 2]: I don't think you know the incentives for the

04:37:45.960 --> 04:37:47.960
[Guest 2]: younger guys is pretty interesting and I've

04:37:47.960 --> 04:37:49.960
[Guest 2]: seen that in the evolution of Hardik Pandya

04:37:49.960 --> 04:37:51.960
[Guest 2]: for example. I mean you look at

04:37:51.960 --> 04:37:53.960
[Guest 2]: a Hardik Pandya and I remember

04:37:53.960 --> 04:37:55.960
[Guest 2]: him seeing years back in

04:37:55.960 --> 04:37:57.960
[Guest 2]: Baroda, look

04:37:57.960 --> 04:37:59.960
[Guest 2]: at his transformation and that's

04:37:59.960 --> 04:38:01.960
[Guest 2]: what exposure can do right? Today

04:38:01.960 --> 04:38:03.960
[Guest 2]: the captain of Lucknow

04:38:03.960 --> 04:38:05.960
[Guest 2]: he's led the team beautifully

04:38:05.960 --> 04:38:07.960
[Guest 2]: because native intelligence in these guys is a lot

04:38:07.960 --> 04:38:09.960
[Guest 2]: if he gets a channel

04:38:09.960 --> 04:38:11.960
[Guest 2]: then his intelligence

04:38:11.960 --> 04:38:13.960
[Guest 2]: is way ahead of the urban intelligence

04:38:13.960 --> 04:38:15.960
[Guest 2]: so the hunger definitely is there

04:38:15.960 --> 04:38:17.960
[Guest 2]: I don't know what Ronaldo is talking about because

04:38:17.960 --> 04:38:19.960
[Guest 2]: Europe is a different ball game, in Europe

04:38:19.960 --> 04:38:21.960
[Guest 2]: no one works so maybe in his context

04:38:21.960 --> 04:38:23.960
[Guest 2]: he might be right that

04:38:23.960 --> 04:38:25.960
[Guest 2]: you know I was watching a test match in Nottingham

04:38:25.960 --> 04:38:27.960
[Guest 2]: years back and

04:38:27.960 --> 04:38:29.960
[Guest 2]: there was this English teacher sitting next to

04:38:29.960 --> 04:38:31.960
[Guest 2]: me and we were talking

04:38:31.960 --> 04:38:33.960
[Guest 2]: and I said what's happening in education

04:38:33.960 --> 04:38:35.960
[Guest 2]: and what do you teach and he was teaching

04:38:35.960 --> 04:38:37.960
[Guest 2]: in a school in Nottingham, he said

04:38:37.960 --> 04:38:39.960
[Guest 2]: how do you communicate

04:38:39.960 --> 04:38:41.960
[Guest 2]: with the young kids? He said Vikram the biggest

04:38:41.960 --> 04:38:43.960
[Guest 2]: communication I have to do

04:38:43.960 --> 04:38:45.960
[Guest 2]: with young children in Britain

04:38:45.960 --> 04:38:47.960
[Guest 2]: is to tell them that you have to

04:38:47.960 --> 04:38:49.960
[Guest 2]: work for a living

04:38:49.960 --> 04:38:51.960
[Guest 2]: so I said why?

04:38:51.960 --> 04:38:53.960
[Guest 2]: You have to understand he's seen his dad

04:38:53.960 --> 04:38:55.960
[Amit Varma]: in front of the television

04:38:55.960 --> 04:38:57.960
[Guest 2]: with his beer in hand, he's seen his grandfather

04:38:57.960 --> 04:38:59.960
[Guest 2]: do the same, now there is

04:38:59.960 --> 04:39:01.960
[Guest 2]: a teacher like me who's telling them brother you have

04:39:01.960 --> 04:39:03.960
[Guest 2]: to work, otherwise

04:39:03.960 --> 04:39:05.960
[Guest 2]: you won't get any salary or you won't get

04:39:05.960 --> 04:39:07.960
[Guest 2]: that telly life that your father's, so he's

04:39:07.960 --> 04:39:09.960
[Guest 2]: saying that the challenge is different in Europe

04:39:09.960 --> 04:39:11.960
[Guest 2]: but in our case it's not that, this might

04:39:11.960 --> 04:39:13.960
[Guest 2]: become in pockets in urban India

04:39:13.960 --> 04:39:15.960
[Guest 2]: but still kids have to work

04:39:15.960 --> 04:39:17.960
[Guest 2]: and I think after IPL

04:39:17.960 --> 04:39:19.960
[Guest 2]: that incentive

04:39:19.960 --> 04:39:21.960
[Guest 2]: and Hardik Pandya came to know that

04:39:21.960 --> 04:39:23.960
[Guest 2]: this is my lifestyle to maintain

04:39:23.960 --> 04:39:25.960
[Guest 2]: I have to go to gym for 6 hours

04:39:25.960 --> 04:39:27.960
[Guest 2]: it's amazing how

04:39:27.960 --> 04:39:29.960
[Guest 2]: material wealth also drives many of these

04:39:29.960 --> 04:39:31.960
[Guest 1]: in a good way also

04:39:31.960 --> 04:39:33.960
[Guest 1]: he went through his

04:39:33.960 --> 04:39:35.960
[Guest 1]: Juhu phase also with coffee

04:39:35.960 --> 04:39:37.960
[Guest 2]: with Karan, no but you know

04:39:37.960 --> 04:39:39.960
[Unknown]: I'll tell you what, that

04:39:39.960 --> 04:39:41.960
[Unknown]: he's still there but

04:39:41.960 --> 04:39:43.960
[Guest 2]: the evolution and understanding that

04:39:43.960 --> 04:39:45.960
[Guest 2]: boss next time when I'm going to coffee with Karan

04:39:45.960 --> 04:39:47.960
[Guest 2]: I don't think it's Hardik Pandya's fault

04:39:47.960 --> 04:39:49.960
[Guest 2]: it's Karan Johar's fault

04:39:49.960 --> 04:39:51.960
[Guest 2]: so the thing is that

04:39:51.960 --> 04:39:53.960
[Guest 2]: he's a 24-25 year old boy

04:39:53.960 --> 04:39:55.960
[Guest 1]: you make him look cool

04:39:55.960 --> 04:39:57.960
[Guest 2]: exactly

04:39:57.960 --> 04:39:59.960
[Guest 2]: and look at his lens

04:39:59.960 --> 04:40:01.960
[Guest 2]: if I abuse him in English

04:40:01.960 --> 04:40:03.960
[Guest 2]: it's cool, if I abuse him in Hindi

04:40:03.960 --> 04:40:05.960
[Guest 2]: you'll say I had a great time with this chick

04:40:05.960 --> 04:40:07.960
[Guest 2]: cool, what a guy

04:40:07.960 --> 04:40:09.960
[Guest 2]: if I abuse him in Hindi

04:40:09.960 --> 04:40:11.960
[Guest 2]: you'll say I had a great time with this chick

04:40:11.960 --> 04:40:13.960
[Guest 2]: same right, I had a good time

04:40:13.960 --> 04:40:15.960
[Guest 2]: with this girl that night

04:40:15.960 --> 04:40:17.960
[Guest 2]: but the thing is that if we speak in Hindi

04:40:17.960 --> 04:40:19.960
[Guest 2]: it becomes down market, if we speak in English

04:40:19.960 --> 04:40:21.960
[Guest 2]: it becomes cool, so I think the Karan Johar

04:40:21.960 --> 04:40:23.960
[Guest 2]: dynamics was that he understood it

04:40:23.960 --> 04:40:25.960
[Unknown]: and see what his journey is

04:40:25.960 --> 04:40:27.960
[Guest 2]: to come out of a back injury and be

04:40:27.960 --> 04:40:29.960
[Guest 2]: playing the way he does is amazing

04:40:29.960 --> 04:40:31.960
[Guest 2]: and work ethics again

04:40:31.960 --> 04:40:33.960
[Guest 2]: you spoke about work ethics

04:40:33.960 --> 04:40:35.960
[Guest 2]: I think some of these guys just

04:40:35.960 --> 04:40:37.960
[Guest 2]: are amazing, their work ethics

04:40:37.960 --> 04:40:39.960
[Guest 2]: the priorities at T20 cricket

04:40:39.960 --> 04:40:41.960
[Guest 2]: what can you do about it, I mean that is because of

04:40:41.960 --> 04:40:43.960
[Guest 2]: the economic set play, you suddenly make

04:40:43.960 --> 04:40:45.960
[Guest 2]: more, I mean it's a very simple problem to

04:40:45.960 --> 04:40:47.960
[Guest 2]: solve, I always tell anybody from BCCI

04:40:47.960 --> 04:40:49.960
[Guest 2]: that make marquee test tournaments and

04:40:49.960 --> 04:40:51.960
[Guest 2]: pay Cheteshwar Pujara 20 crore rupees

04:40:51.960 --> 04:40:53.960
[Guest 2]: Hardik Pandey will also start playing test cricket

04:40:53.960 --> 04:40:55.960
[Guest 2]: the problem is you have to change

04:40:55.960 --> 04:40:57.960
[Amit Varma]: your incentives accordingly, I actually think

04:40:57.960 --> 04:40:59.960
[Amit Varma]: that you know Hardik's injury was unfortunate

04:40:59.960 --> 04:41:01.960
[Amit Varma]: because he was at that time in the

04:41:01.960 --> 04:41:03.960
[Amit Varma]: test team as a number 6, I think he'll be a great

04:41:03.960 --> 04:41:05.960
[Guest 2]: test player, I don't think he needs to do

04:41:05.960 --> 04:41:07.960
[Guest 2]: anything differently, but Amit the problem is

04:41:07.960 --> 04:41:09.960
[Guest 2]: that he wants to prioritize it to

04:41:09.960 --> 04:41:11.960
[Guest 2]: T20 cricket because now

04:41:11.960 --> 04:41:13.960
[Guest 2]: you, a player knows that boss

04:41:13.960 --> 04:41:15.960
[Amit Varma]: I have 6-8 years, he's my thinking right

04:41:15.960 --> 04:41:17.960
[Guest 2]: 6-8 years, you keep ROI

04:41:17.960 --> 04:41:19.960
[Amit Varma]: more than T20 and I don't blame him

04:41:19.960 --> 04:41:21.960
[Unknown]: Sir, he should meet with Roshan and hear this

04:41:21.960 --> 04:41:23.960
[Amit Varma]: 120 years funda

04:41:23.960 --> 04:41:25.960
[Amit Varma]: then he'll play test cricket so much

04:41:25.960 --> 04:41:27.960
[Amit Varma]: because he has a lot of time, but you know

04:41:27.960 --> 04:41:29.960
[Amit Varma]: I wouldn't make a value

04:41:29.960 --> 04:41:31.960
[Amit Varma]: judgment there, there are separate sports

04:41:31.960 --> 04:41:33.960
[Guest 2]: where he has decided to excel in one

04:41:33.960 --> 04:41:35.960
[Guest 2]: and there is only one thing about this boss

04:41:35.960 --> 04:41:37.960
[Guest 2]: like Europe has cracked it

04:41:37.960 --> 04:41:39.960
[Guest 2]: that boss

04:41:39.960 --> 04:41:41.960
[Guest 2]: we have to keep opera alive

04:41:41.960 --> 04:41:43.960
[Guest 2]: we have to keep the parallel theatre alive

04:41:43.960 --> 04:41:45.960
[Guest 2]: they will get a show

04:41:45.960 --> 04:41:47.960
[Guest 2]: they will get 100 shows, state should fund

04:41:47.960 --> 04:41:49.960
[Guest 2]: state's work

04:41:49.960 --> 04:41:51.960
[Guest 2]: culture ministry has only one

04:41:51.960 --> 04:41:53.960
[Guest 2]: work, the culture that is dying

04:41:53.960 --> 04:41:55.960
[Guest 2]: keep giving money to it, rest you don't have to

04:41:55.960 --> 04:41:57.960
[Guest 2]: do anything, once you have

04:41:57.960 --> 04:41:59.960
[Guest 2]: empowered 40 directors of parallel theatre

04:41:59.960 --> 04:42:01.960
[Guest 2]: and told them

04:42:01.960 --> 04:42:03.960
[Guest 2]: that I will fund one play of yours

04:42:03.960 --> 04:42:05.960
[Guest 2]: every year, those 40 plays will be made

04:42:05.960 --> 04:42:07.960
[Guest 2]: and people will come to watch

04:42:07.960 --> 04:42:09.960
[Guest 2]: but the problem is that CAPEX is not solved

04:42:09.960 --> 04:42:11.960
[Guest 2]: and their livelihood is not solved

04:42:11.960 --> 04:42:13.960
[Guest 2]: state should not make plays

04:42:13.960 --> 04:42:15.960
[Guest 2]: but they should just fund a dying art

04:42:15.960 --> 04:42:17.960
[Guest 2]: and that's what is happening

04:42:17.960 --> 04:42:19.960
[Guest 2]: BCCI has 5 billion dollars in the bank

04:42:19.960 --> 04:42:21.960
[Guest 2]: they have just to create marquee test

04:42:21.960 --> 04:42:23.960
[Guest 2]: matches and the guys

04:42:23.960 --> 04:42:25.960
[Guest 2]: who are playing test cricket have to be

04:42:25.960 --> 04:42:27.960
[Guest 2]: paid equal to IPL

04:42:27.960 --> 04:42:29.960
[Guest 2]: and you have the money, it's not

04:42:29.960 --> 04:42:31.960
[Guest 2]: that you have to get the money, you say

04:42:31.960 --> 04:42:33.960
[Guest 2]: that Pujara you will play this thing but you will get

04:42:33.960 --> 04:42:35.960
[Guest 2]: your 10 crores, which you are missing out on IPL

04:42:35.960 --> 04:42:37.960
[Guest 2]: unless you incentivize

04:42:37.960 --> 04:42:39.960
[Guest 2]: test cricket, why will Hardik Pandya play

04:42:39.960 --> 04:42:41.960
[Amit Varma]: test cricket? Yeah but my question is that you are making

04:42:41.960 --> 04:42:43.960
[Amit Varma]: an implicit value judgment here by saying

04:42:43.960 --> 04:42:45.960
[Amit Varma]: that test cricket is superior to T20

04:42:45.960 --> 04:42:47.960
[Guest 2]: so you should incentivize it

04:42:47.960 --> 04:42:49.960
[Guest 2]: I am saying why? I am just

04:42:49.960 --> 04:42:51.960
[Guest 2]: saying that 3 forms are very high

04:42:51.960 --> 04:42:53.960
[Guest 2]: given a choice, this is my personal opinion

04:42:53.960 --> 04:42:55.960
[Guest 1]: 3 forms

04:42:55.960 --> 04:42:57.960
[Guest 1]: 3 forms of cricket, no I am saying there should be

04:42:57.960 --> 04:42:59.960
[Guest 2]: 2, there should be 2 forms of cricket

04:42:59.960 --> 04:43:01.960
[Guest 2]: one you keep Bollywood

04:43:01.960 --> 04:43:03.960
[Guest 1]: music which is T20 cricket

04:43:03.960 --> 04:43:05.960
[Guest 2]: which is a great format everybody enjoys

04:43:05.960 --> 04:43:07.960
[Guest 2]: one you keep as whatever

04:43:07.960 --> 04:43:09.960
[Guest 2]: as we discussed in this thing

04:43:09.960 --> 04:43:11.960
[Guest 2]: there is chess which can't

04:43:11.960 --> 04:43:13.960
[Guest 2]: go to 8 billion people so there are good art forms

04:43:13.960 --> 04:43:15.960
[Guest 2]: which have to be kept but

04:43:15.960 --> 04:43:17.960
[Guest 2]: chess has to become viable

04:43:17.960 --> 04:43:19.960
[Guest 2]: and you have an organization

04:43:19.960 --> 04:43:21.960
[Amit Varma]: which can make test cricket viable

04:43:21.960 --> 04:43:23.960
[Amit Varma]: what I would say is that first of all chess chess

04:43:23.960 --> 04:43:25.960
[Unknown]: as it happens

04:43:25.960 --> 04:43:27.960
[Amit Varma]: first of all what I would say is that chess chess

04:43:27.960 --> 04:43:29.960
[Amit Varma]: like actual chess not in this metaphor

04:43:29.960 --> 04:43:31.960
[Guest 2]: is viable today

04:43:31.960 --> 04:43:33.960
[Guest 2]: I am sorry bad example

04:43:33.960 --> 04:43:35.960
[Amit Varma]: number 2 what I would say is that no I disagree with you

04:43:35.960 --> 04:43:37.960
[Amit Varma]: I don't think T20 is Bollywood music

04:43:37.960 --> 04:43:39.960
[Amit Varma]: T20 and

04:43:39.960 --> 04:43:41.960
[Amit Varma]: test cricket are different sports in the same way

04:43:41.960 --> 04:43:43.960
[Amit Varma]: badminton and TT are separate sports

04:43:43.960 --> 04:43:45.960
[Amit Varma]: badminton and tennis are separate sports

04:43:45.960 --> 04:43:47.960
[Amit Varma]: something similar like racket is there, net is there

04:43:47.960 --> 04:43:49.960
[Amit Varma]: you are hitting from it

04:43:49.960 --> 04:43:51.960
[Amit Varma]: but they are actually separate sports

04:43:51.960 --> 04:43:53.960
[Amit Varma]: I will not make a value judgment and say

04:43:53.960 --> 04:43:55.960
[Amit Varma]: one is mass and one is class

04:43:55.960 --> 04:43:57.960
[Amit Varma]: that's not my scene, I am perfectly happy with the

04:43:57.960 --> 04:43:59.960
[Amit Varma]: BCCI keeping test cricket alive

04:43:59.960 --> 04:44:01.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean T20s are basically subsidizing test cricket

04:44:01.960 --> 04:44:03.960
[Amit Varma]: I am happy with that out of nostalgia

04:44:03.960 --> 04:44:05.960
[Amit Varma]: but to incentivize them

04:44:05.960 --> 04:44:07.960
[Amit Varma]: artificially to the level

04:44:07.960 --> 04:44:09.960
[Amit Varma]: where people there get the same

04:44:09.960 --> 04:44:11.960
[Amit Varma]: kind of money, I don't see

04:44:11.960 --> 04:44:13.960
[Amit Varma]: you know why, it depends on whose skills are

04:44:13.960 --> 04:44:15.960
[Amit Varma]: in demand

04:44:15.960 --> 04:44:17.960
[Amit Varma]: like if you think about it a T20

04:44:17.960 --> 04:44:19.960
[Amit Varma]: game for example is much much longer

04:44:19.960 --> 04:44:21.960
[Amit Varma]: than a football game

04:44:21.960 --> 04:44:23.960
[Amit Varma]: you know why aren't you looking at

04:44:23.960 --> 04:44:25.960
[Amit Varma]: football through the same lens, why aren't you saying

04:44:25.960 --> 04:44:27.960
[Amit Varma]: match 3 day football

04:44:27.960 --> 04:44:29.960
[Amit Varma]: this is my personal opinion

04:44:29.960 --> 04:44:31.960
[Guest 2]: this is my purely personal

04:44:31.960 --> 04:44:33.960
[Guest 2]: opinion because just like I like T20

04:44:33.960 --> 04:44:35.960
[Guest 2]: cricket, I find test cricket more

04:44:35.960 --> 04:44:37.960
[Guest 2]: engrossing, this is my personal opinion

04:44:37.960 --> 04:44:39.960
[Guest 2]: because I get more out of a

04:44:39.960 --> 04:44:41.960
[Guest 2]: session in test cricket

04:44:41.960 --> 04:44:43.960
[Guest 2]: again, this is not my value judgment

04:44:43.960 --> 04:44:45.960
[Guest 2]: on the entire, but therefore it is in

04:44:45.960 --> 04:44:47.960
[Guest 2]: my interest, personal interest to

04:44:47.960 --> 04:44:49.960
[Guest 2]: keep two formats alive

04:44:49.960 --> 04:44:51.960
[Guest 2]: one format is on

04:44:51.960 --> 04:44:53.960
[Guest 2]: probably based on market economics, it will be alive

04:44:53.960 --> 04:44:55.960
[Guest 2]: for the next 20 years at least, till the time

04:44:55.960 --> 04:44:57.960
[Guest 2]: a T10 comes and replaces T20 cricket

04:44:57.960 --> 04:44:59.960
[Guest 2]: and I think there is a lot of potential in

04:44:59.960 --> 04:45:01.960
[Guest 2]: T10 cricket also, but that's a separate

04:45:01.960 --> 04:45:03.960
[Guest 2]: thing, but given a choice personally

04:45:03.960 --> 04:45:05.960
[Guest 2]: I would like Indian classical music

04:45:05.960 --> 04:45:07.960
[Guest 2]: also, classical musician

04:45:07.960 --> 04:45:09.960
[Guest 2]: who currently is worried about surviving

04:45:09.960 --> 04:45:11.960
[Guest 2]: to not get Arijit Singh's

04:45:11.960 --> 04:45:13.960
[Guest 2]: 2 crore per concert, but at least

04:45:13.960 --> 04:45:15.960
[Guest 2]: get 5 lakh rupees, so I am not saying

04:45:15.960 --> 04:45:17.960
[Guest 2]: 10 crores to 10 crores, but I am saying

04:45:17.960 --> 04:45:19.960
[Guest 2]: keep it, I like it here

04:45:19.960 --> 04:45:21.960
[Amit Varma]: I agree with you, but my

04:45:21.960 --> 04:45:23.960
[Amit Varma]: feeling is that

04:45:23.960 --> 04:45:25.960
[Amit Varma]: you know Indian classical music is

04:45:25.960 --> 04:45:27.960
[Amit Varma]: alive because of Indian classical

04:45:27.960 --> 04:45:29.960
[Amit Varma]: lovers who are still paying money to go

04:45:29.960 --> 04:45:31.960
[Amit Varma]: to concerts and buy records and do all of that

04:45:31.960 --> 04:45:33.960
[Amit Varma]: so I think Test Cricket will stay alive the same

04:45:33.960 --> 04:45:35.960
[Amit Varma]: way, I hope so

04:45:35.960 --> 04:45:37.960
[Guest 1]: yeah, I am certain

04:45:37.960 --> 04:45:39.960
[Guest 1]: also you see again, I look at this

04:45:39.960 --> 04:45:41.960
[Guest 1]: podcast again, for example everybody

04:45:41.960 --> 04:45:43.960
[Guest 1]: podcasting, podcasting globally

04:45:43.960 --> 04:45:45.960
[Guest 1]: in America, podcasting

04:45:45.960 --> 04:45:47.960
[Guest 1]: in this million plus listens

04:45:47.960 --> 04:45:49.960
[Guest 1]: which is not there in India

04:45:49.960 --> 04:45:51.960
[Guest 1]: and people keep giving this bullshit of

04:45:51.960 --> 04:45:53.960
[Guest 1]: I have got so many listens and I have got so many listens and whatever

04:45:53.960 --> 04:45:55.960
[Guest 1]: and I track this just generally because of

04:45:55.960 --> 04:45:57.960
[Guest 1]: interest in the space and I

04:45:57.960 --> 04:45:59.960
[Guest 1]: keep saying that boss, it's not a viable

04:45:59.960 --> 04:46:01.960
[Guest 1]: medium if you try to do advertising

04:46:01.960 --> 04:46:03.960
[Guest 1]: funded, it is viable

04:46:03.960 --> 04:46:05.960
[Guest 1]: the way he is doing it, saying you like my

04:46:05.960 --> 04:46:07.960
[Guest 1]: podcast, you know pay me enough

04:46:07.960 --> 04:46:09.960
[Guest 1]: either pay me for a coffee, very subtly he puts

04:46:09.960 --> 04:46:11.960
[Guest 1]: a coffee or a, what do you say, what meal

04:46:11.960 --> 04:46:13.960
[Amit Varma]: a hearty lunch, I don't even

04:46:13.960 --> 04:46:15.960
[Guest 1]: advertise it anymore, but enough comes in

04:46:15.960 --> 04:46:17.960
[Guest 1]: but it comes in obviously, and sell your other

04:46:17.960 --> 04:46:19.960
[Guest 1]: products on it, right and you are selling your other

04:46:19.960 --> 04:46:21.960
[Guest 1]: products, he has built this little

04:46:21.960 --> 04:46:23.960
[Guest 1]: economy around himself which is there

04:46:23.960 --> 04:46:25.960
[Guest 1]: is it enough for

04:46:25.960 --> 04:46:27.960
[Guest 1]: him to survive, definitely, right

04:46:27.960 --> 04:46:29.960
[Guest 1]: similarly with TestKillKit

04:46:29.960 --> 04:46:31.960
[Guest 1]: there should be an economy and

04:46:31.960 --> 04:46:33.960
[Guest 2]: X number of people who enjoy it will like it

04:46:33.960 --> 04:46:35.960
[Guest 2]: similarly classical music

04:46:35.960 --> 04:46:37.960
[Guest 2]: that's what I tell all the marketers also

04:46:37.960 --> 04:46:39.960
[Guest 2]: that every time you go and sell

04:46:39.960 --> 04:46:41.960
[Guest 2]: a concept to a marketer, the

04:46:41.960 --> 04:46:43.960
[Guest 2]: marketer is basing the

04:46:43.960 --> 04:46:45.960
[Guest 2]: money given to you based on

04:46:45.960 --> 04:46:47.960
[Guest 2]: impressions, so I one day

04:46:47.960 --> 04:46:49.960
[Guest 2]: explained to a head of marketing that

04:46:49.960 --> 04:46:51.960
[Guest 2]: you have to understand that the highest

04:46:51.960 --> 04:46:53.960
[Guest 2]: selling item on the internet is pornography

04:46:53.960 --> 04:46:55.960
[Guest 2]: pornography drove the internet

04:46:55.960 --> 04:46:57.960
[Guest 2]: but that doesn't

04:46:57.960 --> 04:46:59.960
[Guest 2]: mean that a show where

04:46:59.960 --> 04:47:01.960
[Guest 2]: you are showing fully clothed people

04:47:01.960 --> 04:47:03.960
[Guest 2]: talking about a certain

04:47:03.960 --> 04:47:05.960
[Guest 2]: issue is not

04:47:05.960 --> 04:47:07.960
[Guest 2]: good enough, you cannot compete with

04:47:07.960 --> 04:47:09.960
[Guest 2]: pornography and I am saying even violence

04:47:09.960 --> 04:47:11.960
[Guest 2]: also just like OTT we are discussing

04:47:11.960 --> 04:47:13.960
[Guest 2]: that right, but as long as the

04:47:13.960 --> 04:47:15.960
[Guest 2]: head of marketing understand that these

04:47:15.960 --> 04:47:17.960
[Guest 2]: 50,000 views are also

04:47:17.960 --> 04:47:19.960
[Guest 2]: important from the product point

04:47:19.960 --> 04:47:21.960
[Guest 2]: of view and these 20 million

04:47:21.960 --> 04:47:23.960
[Guest 2]: people, I will not be able to give you that

04:47:23.960 --> 04:47:25.960
[Guest 2]: but today if you go

04:47:25.960 --> 04:47:27.960
[Guest 2]: to a company which is even selling

04:47:27.960 --> 04:47:29.960
[Guest 2]: to those 50,000 people

04:47:29.960 --> 04:47:31.960
[Guest 2]: they are also wanting to go

04:47:31.960 --> 04:47:33.960
[Guest 2]: with an influencer who has 10 million

04:47:33.960 --> 04:47:35.960
[Unknown]: followers because the marketing

04:47:35.960 --> 04:47:37.960
[Guest 2]: because the marketing head says

04:47:37.960 --> 04:47:39.960
[Guest 2]: I did 4 influencers

04:47:39.960 --> 04:47:41.960
[Guest 2]: they have 50 million

04:47:41.960 --> 04:47:43.960
[Guest 2]: so they didn't come yet, that

04:47:43.960 --> 04:47:45.960
[Guest 2]: is what I am worried about

04:47:45.960 --> 04:47:47.960
[Guest 2]: the guys have to take a call

04:47:47.960 --> 04:47:49.960
[Guest 2]: I am saying if you are paying 10 rupees to this guy

04:47:49.960 --> 04:47:51.960
[Guest 2]: pay 2 rupees at least to this guy

04:47:51.960 --> 04:47:53.960
[Guest 2]: otherwise this content will never come out

04:47:53.960 --> 04:47:55.960
[Amit Varma]: Ok, two things, one is

04:47:55.960 --> 04:47:57.960
[Amit Varma]: I think that a lot of the people who tell me

04:47:57.960 --> 04:47:59.960
[Amit Varma]: we love test cricket, don't watch test cricket

04:47:59.960 --> 04:48:01.960
[Amit Varma]: if they watched it, this problem would be solved on its

04:48:01.960 --> 04:48:03.960
[Amit Varma]: own, so I think that's where

04:48:03.960 --> 04:48:05.960
[Amit Varma]: the 2 rupees will come from, from the voluntary

04:48:05.960 --> 04:48:07.960
[Guest 2]: actions of people. I think just to

04:48:07.960 --> 04:48:09.960
[Guest 2]: interrupt you here, the younger generation

04:48:09.960 --> 04:48:11.960
[Guest 2]: does not watch test cricket

04:48:11.960 --> 04:48:13.960
[Guest 2]: that's my personal experience, my sample size

04:48:13.960 --> 04:48:15.960
[Guest 2]: that I have watched, but today in England

04:48:15.960 --> 04:48:17.960
[Guest 2]: when I say again

04:48:17.960 --> 04:48:19.960
[Guest 2]: somebody might say that statistics

04:48:19.960 --> 04:48:21.960
[Guest 2]: shows that in the last ashes test

04:48:21.960 --> 04:48:23.960
[Guest 2]: 40% of the crowd, no

04:48:23.960 --> 04:48:25.960
[Guest 2]: I am saying purely my

04:48:25.960 --> 04:48:27.960
[Guest 2]: observation over the last 8 years

04:48:27.960 --> 04:48:29.960
[Guest 2]: watching test cricket is that they don't come

04:48:29.960 --> 04:48:31.960
[Guest 2]: our 42

04:48:31.960 --> 04:48:33.960
[Guest 2]: onwards

04:48:33.960 --> 04:48:35.960
[Guest 2]: these people come to watch test cricket

04:48:35.960 --> 04:48:37.960
[Guest 2]: and this will slowly decrease

04:48:37.960 --> 04:48:39.960
[Guest 2]: because the game of brands will be

04:48:39.960 --> 04:48:41.960
[Guest 2]: dependent on 15 to 34

04:48:41.960 --> 04:48:43.960
[Guest 2]: as ex-marketers we would know

04:48:43.960 --> 04:48:45.960
[Guest 2]: that all money is spent between

04:48:45.960 --> 04:48:47.960
[Guest 2]: this segment, unless it's a brand that

04:48:47.960 --> 04:48:49.960
[Guest 2]: caters only for the top segment

04:48:49.960 --> 04:48:51.960
[Guest 2]: because that also they say that if 15

04:48:51.960 --> 04:48:53.960
[Guest 2]: to 34 accepts it,

04:48:53.960 --> 04:48:55.960
[Guest 2]: it's shadow falls on the upper

04:48:55.960 --> 04:48:57.960
[Guest 2]: segment as well, so from that perspective

04:48:57.960 --> 04:48:59.960
[Guest 1]: test cricket will suffer.

04:48:59.960 --> 04:49:01.960
[Guest 1]: But you know going back to what Amit said earlier

04:49:01.960 --> 04:49:03.960
[Guest 1]: that younger people have time and

04:49:03.960 --> 04:49:05.960
[Guest 1]: less money, older people have got

04:49:05.960 --> 04:49:07.960
[Guest 1]: money and less time or whatever

04:49:07.960 --> 04:49:09.960
[Guest 1]: and that bias can actually

04:49:09.960 --> 04:49:11.960
[Guest 1]: be programmed into doing things

04:49:11.960 --> 04:49:13.960
[Guest 1]: see, if you built more

04:49:13.960 --> 04:49:15.960
[Guest 1]: limit test viewing for 10,000

04:49:15.960 --> 04:49:17.960
[Guest 1]: people, but intimate, right

04:49:17.960 --> 04:49:19.960
[Guest 1]: but people don't solve, people want

04:49:19.960 --> 04:49:21.960
[Guest 1]: the same size fits all, in the same stadium

04:49:21.960 --> 04:49:23.960
[Guest 1]: they want to play cricket, right

04:49:23.960 --> 04:49:25.960
[Guest 1]: when I watched my, I hated cricket

04:49:25.960 --> 04:49:27.960
[Guest 1]: because in Lucknow going and sitting on a bench

04:49:27.960 --> 04:49:29.960
[Guest 1]: and warming your ass was something you didn't

04:49:29.960 --> 04:49:31.960
[Guest 1]: want to do for things you couldn't see

04:49:31.960 --> 04:49:33.960
[Guest 1]: now you go to South Africa

04:49:33.960 --> 04:49:35.960
[Guest 1]: the first time I went during, you know when we were

04:49:35.960 --> 04:49:37.960
[Guest 1]: doing the ultra tech events or whatever and we went down

04:49:37.960 --> 04:49:39.960
[Guest 1]: and it was just a joy to see the thing

04:49:39.960 --> 04:49:41.960
[Guest 1]: and I said it feels good to go here, then here

04:49:41.960 --> 04:49:43.960
[Guest 1]: we do IPL work, god save us

04:49:43.960 --> 04:49:45.960
[Guest 1]: but you go to the newer stadiums

04:49:45.960 --> 04:49:47.960
[Guest 1]: you feel it's better, so I think people

04:49:47.960 --> 04:49:49.960
[Guest 1]: product has to be redesigned

04:49:49.960 --> 04:49:51.960
[Guest 1]: that's the problem, people don't do that

04:49:51.960 --> 04:49:53.960
[Guest 1]: and I'm saying, you know

04:49:53.960 --> 04:49:55.960
[Guest 1]: the concerts for Floyd

04:49:55.960 --> 04:49:57.960
[Guest 1]: the concerts which are

04:49:57.960 --> 04:49:59.960
[Guest 1]: harkening back to Woodstock are selling

04:49:59.960 --> 04:50:01.960
[Guest 1]: more, making more money

04:50:01.960 --> 04:50:03.960
[Guest 1]: people just don't

04:50:03.960 --> 04:50:05.960
[Guest 1]: package a great show with one or

04:50:05.960 --> 04:50:07.960
[Guest 1]: two of these people right and see what will happen

04:50:07.960 --> 04:50:09.960
[Guest 1]: but that creating

04:50:09.960 --> 04:50:11.960
[Guest 1]: experiences

04:50:11.960 --> 04:50:13.960
[Guest 1]: you know, again this was a

04:50:13.960 --> 04:50:15.960
[Guest 1]: conversation that we were having earlier that oh the only

04:50:15.960 --> 04:50:17.960
[Guest 1]: artist in India who sell is you know

04:50:17.960 --> 04:50:19.960
[Guest 1]: Arjeet and there's Ya Rehman and maybe

04:50:19.960 --> 04:50:21.960
[Guest 1]: one or two others or whatever, not true

04:50:21.960 --> 04:50:23.960
[Guest 1]: they sell the most

04:50:23.960 --> 04:50:25.960
[Guest 1]: now and Anumita Nadesan is a girl

04:50:25.960 --> 04:50:27.960
[Guest 1]: who's just started

04:50:27.960 --> 04:50:29.960
[Guest 1]: she attracted about a thousand

04:50:29.960 --> 04:50:31.960
[Guest 1]: plus people I think on every show that she's doing

04:50:31.960 --> 04:50:33.960
[Guest 1]: build a show which is for a thousand people

04:50:33.960 --> 04:50:35.960
[Guest 1]: build it in a, you know so

04:50:35.960 --> 04:50:37.960
[Guest 1]: that is something which people don't do

04:50:37.960 --> 04:50:39.960
[Guest 1]: I find that there are so many people

04:50:39.960 --> 04:50:41.960
[Guest 1]: who are not creators

04:50:41.960 --> 04:50:43.960
[Guest 1]: they are riding a wave

04:50:43.960 --> 04:50:45.960
[Guest 1]: right and this is our problem that

04:50:45.960 --> 04:50:47.960
[Guest 1]: if you want to be the facilitation

04:50:47.960 --> 04:50:49.960
[Guest 1]: economy, the facilitation

04:50:49.960 --> 04:50:51.960
[Guest 1]: economy is not the creator economy

04:50:51.960 --> 04:50:53.960
[Guest 1]: I keep trying to explain this to

04:50:53.960 --> 04:50:55.960
[Guest 1]: every artist management agency which are run by

04:50:55.960 --> 04:50:57.960
[Guest 1]: many of our friends, saying yaar value

04:50:57.960 --> 04:50:59.960
[Guest 1]: add karo, creator

04:50:59.960 --> 04:51:01.960
[Guest 1]: economy, jo create kar raha hai

04:51:01.960 --> 04:51:03.960
[Guest 1]: Kusha Kapila is in the Forbes

04:51:03.960 --> 04:51:05.960
[Guest 1]: 30 under 30, not

04:51:05.960 --> 04:51:07.960
[Guest 1]: for money earned

04:51:07.960 --> 04:51:09.960
[Guest 1]: for being one of India's most influential

04:51:09.960 --> 04:51:11.960
[Guest 1]: because she is, her brand

04:51:11.960 --> 04:51:13.960
[Guest 1]: integrations are so beautiful

04:51:13.960 --> 04:51:15.960
[Guest 1]: that you watch that

04:51:15.960 --> 04:51:17.960
[Guest 1]: brand integration because the girl has figured out

04:51:17.960 --> 04:51:19.960
[Guest 1]: and she doesn't let anybody else control her narrative

04:51:19.960 --> 04:51:21.960
[Guest 1]: she's not letting some manager come and say

04:51:21.960 --> 04:51:23.960
[Guest 1]: ek popcorn pakal ke aise bol dena

04:51:23.960 --> 04:51:25.960
[Guest 1]: won't do it, because she's in

04:51:25.960 --> 04:51:27.960
[Guest 1]: control of her narrative, so ye creator

04:51:27.960 --> 04:51:29.960
[Guest 1]: economy separated from

04:51:29.960 --> 04:51:31.960
[Unknown]: facilitator economy and ye facilitation

04:51:31.960 --> 04:51:33.960
[Guest 1]: economy is the

04:51:33.960 --> 04:51:35.960
[Amit Varma]: tailor of most of these things

04:51:35.960 --> 04:51:37.960
[Amit Varma]: So I have a question for both of you as marketers

04:51:37.960 --> 04:51:39.960
[Amit Varma]: but first I want to comment, you said that

04:51:39.960 --> 04:51:41.960
[Amit Varma]: aap test match nahi dekhne jaate the

04:51:41.960 --> 04:51:43.960
[Amit Varma]: why will you warm your ass on a bench

04:51:43.960 --> 04:51:45.960
[Guest 1]: the thing is with your love for extreme temperatures

04:51:45.960 --> 04:51:47.960
[Guest 1]: you're now paying to warm your ass

04:51:47.960 --> 04:51:49.960
[Guest 1]: Don't worry, now we, but then you should do

04:51:49.960 --> 04:51:51.960
[Guest 1]: test cricket in extreme temperatures

04:51:51.960 --> 04:51:53.960
[Guest 2]: Test cricket in extreme temperatures

04:51:53.960 --> 04:51:55.960
[Guest 2]: or after watching test cricket in Lucknow

04:51:55.960 --> 04:51:57.960
[Amit Varma]: you can go watch Ice Hot Team

04:51:57.960 --> 04:51:59.960
[Amit Varma]: warm your ass, cool

04:51:59.960 --> 04:52:01.960
[Guest 1]: your ass down, soon you don't know where your ass is

04:52:01.960 --> 04:52:03.960
[Guest 1]: Oh yeah, ass from your elbow

04:52:03.960 --> 04:52:05.960
[Guest 1]: and kindly

04:52:05.960 --> 04:52:07.960
[Guest 1]: refer to Amit's

04:52:07.960 --> 04:52:09.960
[Amit Varma]: I boiled my bottoms

04:52:09.960 --> 04:52:11.960
[Amit Varma]: I boiled my buttocks

04:52:11.960 --> 04:52:13.960
[Amit Varma]: I will duly post that

04:52:13.960 --> 04:52:15.960
[Amit Varma]: So my question for you as marketers is this

04:52:15.960 --> 04:52:17.960
[Amit Varma]: and this in a sense feeds

04:52:17.960 --> 04:52:19.960
[Amit Varma]: into the ODI, the T20

04:52:19.960 --> 04:52:21.960
[Amit Varma]: test match argument, is that

04:52:21.960 --> 04:52:23.960
[Amit Varma]: just in the creator economy, I think one thing

04:52:23.960 --> 04:52:25.960
[Amit Varma]: that advertisers and marketing people

04:52:25.960 --> 04:52:27.960
[Amit Varma]: simply haven't figured out is

04:52:27.960 --> 04:52:29.960
[Amit Varma]: in terms of metrics, how do you

04:52:29.960 --> 04:52:31.960
[Amit Varma]: distinguish from high numbers with low engagement

04:52:31.960 --> 04:52:33.960
[Amit Varma]: with relatively less numbers

04:52:33.960 --> 04:52:35.960
[Unknown]: with high engagement, for example

04:52:35.960 --> 04:52:37.960
[Amit Varma]: I say, and I think any podcaster would really say

04:52:37.960 --> 04:52:39.960
[Amit Varma]: that I would rather have a 100,000

04:52:39.960 --> 04:52:41.960
[Amit Varma]: people listen to an episode than

04:52:41.960 --> 04:52:43.960
[Amit Varma]: 20 million people view a video

04:52:43.960 --> 04:52:45.960
[Amit Varma]: that I put on YouTube, because a video

04:52:45.960 --> 04:52:47.960
[Amit Varma]: your average engagement time might be

04:52:47.960 --> 04:52:49.960
[Amit Varma]: 15 seconds, here for example an average

04:52:49.960 --> 04:52:51.960
[Amit Varma]: session is 40 minutes and people listen

04:52:51.960 --> 04:52:53.960
[Amit Varma]: over multiple sessions, so the engagement

04:52:53.960 --> 04:52:55.960
[Amit Varma]: here is insanely

04:52:55.960 --> 04:52:57.960
[Amit Varma]: off the charts, and luckily

04:52:57.960 --> 04:52:59.960
[Amit Varma]: because I have figured out a way to monetize

04:52:59.960 --> 04:53:01.960
[Amit Varma]: that directly from listeners

04:53:01.960 --> 04:53:03.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, it's cool

04:53:03.960 --> 04:53:05.960
[Amit Varma]: but advertisers simply haven't figured that

04:53:05.960 --> 04:53:07.960
[Amit Varma]: out, I mean why

04:53:07.960 --> 04:53:09.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, why is that

04:53:09.960 --> 04:53:11.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, what's going on here

04:53:11.960 --> 04:53:13.960
[Amit Varma]: and that also plays into the

04:53:13.960 --> 04:53:15.960
[Amit Varma]: T20 test cricket thing because

04:53:15.960 --> 04:53:17.960
[Amit Varma]: the argument then could be

04:53:17.960 --> 04:53:19.960
[Amit Varma]: that somebody who watches test cricket

04:53:19.960 --> 04:53:21.960
[Amit Varma]: both has a deeper engagement

04:53:21.960 --> 04:53:23.960
[Amit Varma]: while watching test cricket and has

04:53:23.960 --> 04:53:25.960
[Amit Varma]: more money to spend on it as Roshan pointed out

04:53:25.960 --> 04:53:27.960
[Amit Varma]: so you know, one

04:53:27.960 --> 04:53:29.960
[Amit Varma]: test cricket viewer could be as

04:53:29.960 --> 04:53:31.960
[Amit Varma]: valuable to you as 10 T20 viewers

04:53:31.960 --> 04:53:33.960
[Amit Varma]: if you know how to tap

04:53:33.960 --> 04:53:35.960
[Guest 2]: into that. Agreed, I mean Roshan

04:53:35.960 --> 04:53:37.960
[Guest 2]: would be able to answer this question better

04:53:37.960 --> 04:53:39.960
[Guest 2]: because he sells even today

04:53:39.960 --> 04:53:41.960
[Guest 2]: as we speak, but my

04:53:41.960 --> 04:53:43.960
[Guest 2]: understanding is that yes, they

04:53:43.960 --> 04:53:45.960
[Guest 2]: might be doing their metric data analysis

04:53:45.960 --> 04:53:47.960
[Guest 2]: and consumer audience surveys

04:53:47.960 --> 04:53:49.960
[Guest 2]: and stuff like that, but I think it's lethargy

04:53:49.960 --> 04:53:51.960
[Guest 2]: because generally

04:53:51.960 --> 04:53:53.960
[Guest 2]: I get a feeling when I talk

04:53:53.960 --> 04:53:55.960
[Guest 2]: to brand managers and stuff like that

04:53:55.960 --> 04:53:57.960
[Guest 2]: that getting a big

04:53:57.960 --> 04:53:59.960
[Guest 2]: celebrity to endorse

04:53:59.960 --> 04:54:01.960
[Guest 2]: the product, I mean I have

04:54:01.960 --> 04:54:03.960
[Guest 2]: nothing against Baiju's but sometimes I

04:54:03.960 --> 04:54:05.960
[Guest 2]: wonder as a marketeer that

04:54:05.960 --> 04:54:07.960
[Guest 2]: a guy who is selling

04:54:07.960 --> 04:54:09.960
[Guest 2]: what do you call, Zuma Kesari

04:54:09.960 --> 04:54:11.960
[Guest 2]: the next ad is Baiju's

04:54:11.960 --> 04:54:13.960
[Guest 2]: education, how does that work

04:54:13.960 --> 04:54:15.960
[Guest 2]: is there some kind of a methodology

04:54:15.960 --> 04:54:17.960
[Guest 2]: and I have nothing against Shah Rukh Khan also

04:54:17.960 --> 04:54:19.960
[Guest 2]: but I'm just saying that somewhere

04:54:19.960 --> 04:54:21.960
[Guest 2]: I don't understand this brand marketing

04:54:21.960 --> 04:54:23.960
[Guest 2]: thing and sometimes I think this is an

04:54:23.960 --> 04:54:25.960
[Guest 2]: investor push, make it big

04:54:25.960 --> 04:54:27.960
[Guest 2]: like Vedantu signed

04:54:27.960 --> 04:54:29.960
[Guest 2]: Aamir Khan, like

04:54:29.960 --> 04:54:31.960
[Guest 2]: why? If you would have

04:54:31.960 --> 04:54:33.960
[Guest 2]: said what has Aamir Khan learnt in

04:54:33.960 --> 04:54:35.960
[Guest 2]: his journey as a filmmaker

04:54:35.960 --> 04:54:37.960
[Guest 2]: and he would have done a series and that

04:54:37.960 --> 04:54:39.960
[Guest 2]: was the reason Vedantu signed on

04:54:39.960 --> 04:54:41.960
[Guest 2]: Aamir Khan, I would have said probably this

04:54:41.960 --> 04:54:43.960
[Guest 2]: is a good reason why

04:54:43.960 --> 04:54:45.960
[Guest 2]: you should sign Aamir Khan, but he is coming and

04:54:45.960 --> 04:54:47.960
[Guest 2]: saying take Vedantu's class, so that's

04:54:47.960 --> 04:54:49.960
[Guest 2]: the part I don't understand because it's lethargy

04:54:49.960 --> 04:54:51.960
[Amit Varma]: So build vehicles of deep engagement

04:54:51.960 --> 04:54:53.960
[Guest 2]: No, it's basically my point

04:54:53.960 --> 04:54:55.960
[Guest 2]: is that I have given Aamir Khan

04:54:55.960 --> 04:54:57.960
[Guest 2]: X number of crores of rupees, he is our brand

04:54:57.960 --> 04:54:59.960
[Guest 2]: ambassador, this is a marketing plan

04:54:59.960 --> 04:55:01.960
[Guest 2]: versus going deep down

04:55:01.960 --> 04:55:03.960
[Guest 2]: understanding what these guys want

04:55:03.960 --> 04:55:05.960
[Guest 2]: and maybe telling Vedantu

04:55:05.960 --> 04:55:07.960
[Guest 2]: to invest in a podcast like yours

04:55:07.960 --> 04:55:09.960
[Guest 2]: because that will have deeper engagement

04:55:09.960 --> 04:55:11.960
[Guest 2]: that may not have the economic play as

04:55:11.960 --> 04:55:13.960
[Guest 2]: Aamir Khan, but still there would be something

04:55:13.960 --> 04:55:15.960
[Guest 2]: but if you go to Vedantu, they'll

04:55:15.960 --> 04:55:17.960
[Guest 2]: say no, it's too much

04:55:17.960 --> 04:55:19.960
[Guest 2]: of hard work, so I

04:55:19.960 --> 04:55:21.960
[Guest 2]: would do a safer option because

04:55:21.960 --> 04:55:23.960
[Guest 2]: many a times I have seen that the guy who is

04:55:23.960 --> 04:55:25.960
[Guest 2]: working in that company wants to

04:55:25.960 --> 04:55:27.960
[Guest 2]: show a successful metric of a

04:55:27.960 --> 04:55:29.960
[Guest 2]: great signee and get another job in

04:55:29.960 --> 04:55:31.960
[Amit Varma]: the next company, so he can get Aamir Khan

04:55:31.960 --> 04:55:33.960
[Amit Varma]: and say yes, 5 lakh views

04:55:33.960 --> 04:55:35.960
[Guest 2]: So there is no incentive to

04:55:35.960 --> 04:55:37.960
[Guest 2]: brand head to show that

04:55:37.960 --> 04:55:39.960
[Guest 2]: I have studied very well

04:55:39.960 --> 04:55:41.960
[Guest 2]: and made this so that

04:55:41.960 --> 04:55:43.960
[Guest 2]: his company will give me more

04:55:43.960 --> 04:55:45.960
[Guest 2]: money, there is an incentive, it's not like that

04:55:45.960 --> 04:55:47.960
[Guest 2]: but I think it plays in the long term

04:55:47.960 --> 04:55:49.960
[Guest 2]: and it doesn't have that much

04:55:49.960 --> 04:55:51.960
[Guest 1]: incentive. So let me

04:55:51.960 --> 04:55:53.960
[Amit Varma]: break this down a little because

04:55:53.960 --> 04:55:55.960
[Amit Varma]: you are right to a certain degree and I am just

04:55:55.960 --> 04:55:57.960
[Amit Varma]: adding to what you are saying. Your right to a certain degree

04:55:57.960 --> 04:55:59.960
[Unknown]: means you are completely wrong.

04:55:59.960 --> 04:56:01.960
[Guest 2]: No, no, no.

04:56:01.960 --> 04:56:03.960
[Guest 2]: How many degrees is there in such an extreme temperature?

04:56:05.960 --> 04:56:07.960
[Guest 1]: See, having worked in the

04:56:07.960 --> 04:56:09.960
[Guest 1]: marketing space in various

04:56:09.960 --> 04:56:11.960
[Guest 1]: avatars from trying to sell radio

04:56:11.960 --> 04:56:13.960
[Guest 1]: to TV to events to whatever

04:56:13.960 --> 04:56:15.960
[Guest 1]: etc, what I have realized is

04:56:15.960 --> 04:56:17.960
[Guest 1]: that 90%, firstly

04:56:17.960 --> 04:56:19.960
[Guest 1]: the marketeer's lifespan

04:56:19.960 --> 04:56:21.960
[Guest 1]: in company has shrunk from 10 years

04:56:21.960 --> 04:56:23.960
[Unknown]: to an average of 2-3 years. Absolutely.

04:56:23.960 --> 04:56:25.960
[Guest 1]: When it is down to 2-3 years, there

04:56:25.960 --> 04:56:27.960
[Guest 1]: is no long term brand building.

04:56:27.960 --> 04:56:29.960
[Guest 1]: Long term brand building is about

04:56:29.960 --> 04:56:31.960
[Guest 1]: investing in things that will

04:56:31.960 --> 04:56:33.960
[Guest 1]: give you

04:56:33.960 --> 04:56:35.960
[Guest 1]: consistent results over

04:56:35.960 --> 04:56:37.960
[Guest 1]: a period of time. If you are there for 3 years

04:56:37.960 --> 04:56:39.960
[Guest 1]: what do you need? You need to win a couple

04:56:39.960 --> 04:56:41.960
[Guest 1]: of awards, you need to keep your

04:56:41.960 --> 04:56:43.960
[Guest 1]: quarter job safe, which means

04:56:43.960 --> 04:56:45.960
[Guest 1]: what did I achieve in this quarter

04:56:45.960 --> 04:56:47.960
[Guest 1]: and any metric can be proven.

04:56:47.960 --> 04:56:49.960
[Guest 1]: You torture statistics enough, they will say

04:56:49.960 --> 04:56:51.960
[Guest 1]: whatever you want them to say. And you have got

04:56:51.960 --> 04:56:53.960
[Guest 1]: experts in media company.

04:56:53.960 --> 04:56:55.960
[Guest 1]: Sorry, I will interrupt. I remembered a

04:56:55.960 --> 04:56:57.960
[Unknown]: Sidhu line. Yeah. Statistics

04:56:57.960 --> 04:56:59.960
[Unknown]: are like mini skirts.

04:56:59.960 --> 04:57:01.960
[Unknown]: They reveal more than what you hide.

04:57:01.960 --> 04:57:03.960
[Amit Varma]: It may not be his original line

04:57:03.960 --> 04:57:05.960
[Amit Varma]: but still. When I used to write in Crick Info

04:57:05.960 --> 04:57:07.960
[Unknown]: he stole a line from me.

04:57:07.960 --> 04:57:09.960
[Unknown]: I wrote in an article

04:57:09.960 --> 04:57:11.960
[Amit Varma]: and I was also too clever

04:57:11.960 --> 04:57:13.960
[Amit Varma]: and it's a bad line. I had written something

04:57:13.960 --> 04:57:15.960
[Amit Varma]: to the effect of the light at the end of the tunnel

04:57:15.960 --> 04:57:17.960
[Amit Varma]: as a torch of a serial killer.

04:57:17.960 --> 04:57:19.960
[Amit Varma]: So he killed it in his accent.

04:57:19.960 --> 04:57:21.960
[Unknown]: It's the torch of an oncoming train.

04:57:21.960 --> 04:57:23.960
[Unknown]: Or something like that.

04:57:23.960 --> 04:57:25.960
[Unknown]: And when you are driving with the demons

04:57:25.960 --> 04:57:27.960
[Guest 1]: you got to have a long spoon.

04:57:27.960 --> 04:57:29.960
[Guest 1]: Seriously what happened

04:57:29.960 --> 04:57:31.960
[Guest 1]: is that

04:57:31.960 --> 04:57:33.960
[Guest 1]: there is an

04:57:33.960 --> 04:57:35.960
[Guest 1]: entire, remember there is a 23,000

04:57:35.960 --> 04:57:37.960
[Guest 1]: crore economy which exists

04:57:37.960 --> 04:57:39.960
[Guest 1]: on doing the same things because

04:57:39.960 --> 04:57:41.960
[Guest 1]: at the end of the day, does the

04:57:41.960 --> 04:57:43.960
[Guest 1]: marketing director want surprises?

04:57:43.960 --> 04:57:45.960
[Guest 1]: Does the CEO suddenly want a surprise?

04:57:45.960 --> 04:57:47.960
[Guest 1]: What did you do? There are so

04:57:47.960 --> 04:57:49.960
[Guest 1]: many articles I read about where is brave

04:57:49.960 --> 04:57:51.960
[Guest 1]: new marketing? Where is the brave new

04:57:51.960 --> 04:57:53.960
[Guest 1]: campaign? Imagine the number of celebrity

04:57:53.960 --> 04:57:55.960
[Guest 1]: endorsements we see in India

04:57:55.960 --> 04:57:57.960
[Guest 1]: during an ad break. Where is the brave

04:57:57.960 --> 04:57:59.960
[Guest 1]: new ad? Where is the storytelling ad?

04:57:59.960 --> 04:58:01.960
[Guest 1]: And when you see the storytelling

04:58:01.960 --> 04:58:03.960
[Guest 1]: ad, it does brilliantly. The Google

04:58:03.960 --> 04:58:05.960
[Guest 1]: ad by Ogilvy, the Facebook ad by

04:58:05.960 --> 04:58:07.960
[Guest 1]: you know, Aggie.

04:58:07.960 --> 04:58:09.960
[Guest 1]: All of these are recent things

04:58:09.960 --> 04:58:11.960
[Guest 1]: that I remember. And then of course, just before

04:58:11.960 --> 04:58:13.960
[Guest 1]: you'll have something called a flurry of

04:58:13.960 --> 04:58:15.960
[Guest 1]: advertising.

04:58:15.960 --> 04:58:17.960
[Guest 1]: Right?

04:58:17.960 --> 04:58:19.960
[Guest 1]: And it's become like, it's called advertising season.

04:58:19.960 --> 04:58:21.960
[Guest 1]: People just keep looking for

04:58:21.960 --> 04:58:23.960
[Guest 1]: you know, I'm very sorry to say

04:58:23.960 --> 04:58:25.960
[Guest 1]: but they actually look out like that. It's horrible.

04:58:25.960 --> 04:58:27.960
[Guest 1]: But in that entire thing you're

04:58:27.960 --> 04:58:29.960
[Guest 1]: looking for,

04:58:29.960 --> 04:58:31.960
[Guest 1]: 80% of

04:58:31.960 --> 04:58:35.960
[Guest 1]: the time, I did what everyone else was doing but I did something different.

04:58:35.960 --> 04:58:37.960
[Guest 1]: What is the something different? New celebrity,

04:58:37.960 --> 04:58:39.960
[Guest 1]: you know,

04:58:39.960 --> 04:58:41.960
[Guest 1]: signed a new artist. The number of

04:58:41.960 --> 04:58:43.960
[Guest 1]: brands that have come to me saying, you know what we're doing?

04:58:43.960 --> 04:58:45.960
[Guest 1]: We're doing a brand revamp and we're doing a new music

04:58:45.960 --> 04:58:47.960
[Guest 1]: video. Okay?

04:58:47.960 --> 04:58:49.960
[Guest 1]: Why? Because you get the reach of a music video.

04:58:49.960 --> 04:58:51.960
[Guest 1]: Why? Because if you play it on T-Series, it's the

04:58:51.960 --> 04:58:53.960
[Guest 1]: maximum played YouTube channel in the world.

04:58:53.960 --> 04:58:55.960
[Guest 1]: Let's at least see this percentage, sir.

04:58:55.960 --> 04:58:57.960
[Guest 1]: This is told to you later. But did you really

04:58:57.960 --> 04:58:59.960
[Guest 1]: invest in making a unique video?

04:58:59.960 --> 04:59:01.960
[Guest 1]: Did you really get, did you get a, like I mean,

04:59:01.960 --> 04:59:03.960
[Guest 1]: there's this lovely director called Reem Sen who's been doing

04:59:03.960 --> 04:59:05.960
[Guest 1]: some fabulous work and you see her work or whatever

04:59:05.960 --> 04:59:07.960
[Guest 1]: and you know, she did that, you know,

04:59:07.960 --> 04:59:09.960
[Guest 1]: that da-da-ding, that lovely,

04:59:09.960 --> 04:59:11.960
[Guest 1]: I think it was a Puma commercial that she did or what.

04:59:11.960 --> 04:59:13.960
[Guest 1]: Brilliant. But that requires

04:59:13.960 --> 04:59:15.960
[Guest 1]: bravery when Piyush, even

04:59:15.960 --> 04:59:17.960
[Guest 1]: today, you know, you sit with Piyush, Piyush sir

04:59:17.960 --> 04:59:19.960
[Guest 1]: does so much work with us.

04:59:19.960 --> 04:59:21.960
[Guest 1]: He says, it's a two-way street.

04:59:21.960 --> 04:59:23.960
[Guest 1]: At least discuss, at least create something new.

04:59:23.960 --> 04:59:25.960
[Guest 1]: They don't want to do that.

04:59:25.960 --> 04:59:27.960
[Guest 1]: The other thing is, if you want to get into the good

04:59:27.960 --> 04:59:29.960
[Guest 1]: jobs of a marketeer,

04:59:29.960 --> 04:59:31.960
[Guest 1]: is win them an award. Because

04:59:31.960 --> 04:59:33.960
[Guest 1]: awards shine on CVs and are

04:59:33.960 --> 04:59:35.960
[Guest 1]: very good for getting your next job.

04:59:35.960 --> 04:59:37.960
[Guest 1]: Awards, our industry has

04:59:37.960 --> 04:59:39.960
[Guest 1]: made so many. I sometimes

04:59:39.960 --> 04:59:41.960
[Guest 1]: tell people saying, if you really want to

04:59:41.960 --> 04:59:43.960
[Guest 1]: value an award, don't enter so many.

04:59:43.960 --> 04:59:45.960
[Guest 1]: Nobody does it. Because everybody wants

04:59:45.960 --> 04:59:47.960
[Guest 1]: to see their name somewhere.

04:59:47.960 --> 04:59:49.960
[Guest 1]: Right? So, Kanpur,

04:59:49.960 --> 04:59:51.960
[Guest 1]: corner, you know,

04:59:51.960 --> 04:59:53.960
[Guest 1]: agency, so-and-so awards, I won.

04:59:53.960 --> 04:59:55.960
[Guest 1]: It feels good. So,

04:59:55.960 --> 04:59:57.960
[Guest 1]: I'm constantly building these

04:59:57.960 --> 04:59:59.960
[Guest 1]: safeguards around them.

04:59:59.960 --> 05:00:01.960
[Guest 1]: I believe that the brave new marketeer

05:00:01.960 --> 05:00:03.960
[Guest 1]: is returning. I'm seeing it. I'm

05:00:03.960 --> 05:00:05.960
[Guest 1]: suddenly noticing it. Don't know whether it's a post-pandemic

05:00:05.960 --> 05:00:07.960
[Guest 1]: thing. People are taking more risks.

05:00:07.960 --> 05:00:09.960
[Guest 1]: People are working with organizations.

05:00:09.960 --> 05:00:11.960
[Guest 1]: Maximum number of people

05:00:11.960 --> 05:00:13.960
[Guest 1]: advertising today in India are

05:00:13.960 --> 05:00:15.960
[Guest 1]: digital companies. Right?

05:00:15.960 --> 05:00:17.960
[Guest 1]: They are mostly digital brands. These brands

05:00:17.960 --> 05:00:19.960
[Guest 1]: have always dreamed

05:00:19.960 --> 05:00:21.960
[Guest 1]: of interacting. Firstly, they

05:00:21.960 --> 05:00:23.960
[Guest 1]: dreamt of legitimacy. In India,

05:00:23.960 --> 05:00:25.960
[Guest 1]: what's the biggest legitimacy? Standing next to a celebrity.

05:00:25.960 --> 05:00:27.960
[Guest 1]: The minute you hire

05:00:27.960 --> 05:00:29.960
[Guest 1]: a celebrity for your brand,

05:00:29.960 --> 05:00:31.960
[Guest 1]: screw what it does for the brand.

05:00:31.960 --> 05:00:33.960
[Guest 1]: The next thing that it does is, you have a picture with the person

05:00:33.960 --> 05:00:35.960
[Guest 1]: in your arm and all your relatives say,

05:00:35.960 --> 05:00:37.960
[Guest 1]: my son is Avida Bachchan's friend. Exactly.

05:00:37.960 --> 05:00:39.960
[Guest 2]: And the CEO should have a photograph with...

05:00:39.960 --> 05:00:41.960
[Guest 1]: That's it. That's all they want.

05:00:41.960 --> 05:00:43.960
[Guest 1]: The biggest demand is not

05:00:43.960 --> 05:00:45.960
[Guest 1]: Sir, in 4 hours, 1 hour

05:00:45.960 --> 05:00:47.960
[Guest 1]: ad will be done, 2 hours with the dealer, 1 hour

05:00:47.960 --> 05:00:49.960
[Guest 1]: with the CEO's family. What kind of

05:00:49.960 --> 05:00:51.960
[Guest 1]: marketing is this? This is not

05:00:51.960 --> 05:00:53.960
[Guest 1]: marketing. This is the appeasement of a certain

05:00:53.960 --> 05:00:55.960
[Guest 1]: ego. And people

05:00:55.960 --> 05:00:57.960
[Guest 1]: endorse this fully. I attend

05:00:57.960 --> 05:00:59.960
[Guest 1]: so many of these media events and then

05:00:59.960 --> 05:01:01.960
[Guest 1]: I stopped doing it recently

05:01:01.960 --> 05:01:03.960
[Guest 1]: because they said that it's the same everywhere.

05:01:03.960 --> 05:01:05.960
[Guest 1]: Same conversation,

05:01:05.960 --> 05:01:07.960
[Guest 1]: same thing, same set of people, whatever.

05:01:07.960 --> 05:01:09.960
[Guest 1]: But really, it will require

05:01:09.960 --> 05:01:11.960
[Guest 1]: a bunch of people who will break

05:01:11.960 --> 05:01:13.960
[Guest 1]: that. And they do.

05:01:13.960 --> 05:01:15.960
[Guest 1]: And again, I mean, you know,

05:01:15.960 --> 05:01:17.960
[Guest 1]: TVF has really come back. And I say that

05:01:17.960 --> 05:01:19.960
[Guest 1]: because I'm noticing it. You go

05:01:19.960 --> 05:01:21.960
[Guest 1]: and say, you know, I want a narrative like TVF.

05:01:21.960 --> 05:01:23.960
[Guest 1]: I want something like this

05:01:23.960 --> 05:01:25.960
[Guest 1]: one did. I'd like an ad that looks...

05:01:25.960 --> 05:01:27.960
[Guest 1]: Then you're...

05:01:27.960 --> 05:01:29.960
[Guest 1]: Some change is happening.

05:01:29.960 --> 05:01:31.960
[Guest 1]: It's happening with a bunch of creators.

05:01:31.960 --> 05:01:33.960
[Guest 1]: And I keep telling people, rather than

05:01:33.960 --> 05:01:35.960
[Guest 1]: put all your money behind one

05:01:35.960 --> 05:01:37.960
[Guest 1]: idea, put

05:01:37.960 --> 05:01:39.960
[Guest 1]: 50% of your money around 20

05:01:39.960 --> 05:01:41.960
[Guest 1]: ideas. See which

05:01:41.960 --> 05:01:43.960
[Guest 1]: one is working and then pump in the media

05:01:43.960 --> 05:01:45.960
[Guest 1]: money to make it big.

05:01:45.960 --> 05:01:47.960
[Guest 1]: The remaining 50%, do whatever you

05:01:47.960 --> 05:01:49.960
[Guest 1]: want. Let people...

05:01:49.960 --> 05:01:51.960
[Guest 1]: Work with new people. This thing of working

05:01:51.960 --> 05:01:53.960
[Guest 1]: with agency of record.

05:01:53.960 --> 05:01:55.960
[Guest 1]: You know, that concept

05:01:55.960 --> 05:01:57.960
[Guest 1]: Oh, because they understood the brand,

05:01:57.960 --> 05:01:59.960
[Guest 1]: the agency invested in it.

05:01:59.960 --> 05:02:01.960
[Guest 1]: Agencies are so... I mean, they're just so

05:02:01.960 --> 05:02:03.960
[Guest 1]: broken down today into functions.

05:02:03.960 --> 05:02:05.960
[Guest 1]: So JW was known for strategy.

05:02:05.960 --> 05:02:07.960
[Guest 1]: Ogilvy was known for creative. So and so was known for media muscle.

05:02:07.960 --> 05:02:09.960
[Guest 1]: Right?

05:02:09.960 --> 05:02:11.960
[Guest 1]: The young creator today knows so much more.

05:02:11.960 --> 05:02:13.960
[Guest 1]: I keep saying that

05:02:13.960 --> 05:02:15.960
[Guest 1]: have a culture council. Have people...

05:02:15.960 --> 05:02:17.960
[Guest 1]: You know, we were chasing at Commune

05:02:17.960 --> 05:02:19.960
[Guest 1]: for a long time. We thought content, content.

05:02:19.960 --> 05:02:21.960
[Guest 1]: And pandemic, actually, because the only thing we could do was generate

05:02:21.960 --> 05:02:23.960
[Guest 1]: content. So everybody became a

05:02:23.960 --> 05:02:25.960
[Guest 1]: content company. I believe every creator

05:02:25.960 --> 05:02:27.960
[Guest 1]: is a content company by themselves.

05:02:27.960 --> 05:02:29.960
[Guest 1]: But the issue is, what

05:02:29.960 --> 05:02:31.960
[Guest 1]: kind of content and in which medium?

05:02:31.960 --> 05:02:33.960
[Guest 1]: I realize that our strongest

05:02:33.960 --> 05:02:35.960
[Guest 1]: play is live and culture.

05:02:35.960 --> 05:02:37.960
[Guest 1]: So I've turned and said,

05:02:37.960 --> 05:02:39.960
[Guest 1]: for making great content, I'll hire

05:02:39.960 --> 05:02:41.960
[Guest 1]: great people and work with them. And if I

05:02:41.960 --> 05:02:43.960
[Guest 1]: even need to put it out beyond the Commune network,

05:02:43.960 --> 05:02:45.960
[Guest 1]: I'll find you five great networks which give you efficacy

05:02:45.960 --> 05:02:47.960
[Guest 1]: and return. But

05:02:47.960 --> 05:02:49.960
[Guest 1]: in live, nobody is able to create

05:02:49.960 --> 05:02:51.960
[Guest 1]: the engagement and experience I do,

05:02:51.960 --> 05:02:53.960
[Guest 1]: which is why Commune will build far

05:02:53.960 --> 05:02:55.960
[Guest 1]: more physical IPs. In

05:02:55.960 --> 05:02:57.960
[Guest 1]: culture, because I deal with so many

05:02:57.960 --> 05:02:59.960
[Guest 1]: creators of such diverse

05:02:59.960 --> 05:03:01.960
[Guest 1]: interests, I am building culture councils

05:03:01.960 --> 05:03:03.960
[Guest 1]: and going to brands saying, come,

05:03:03.960 --> 05:03:05.960
[Guest 1]: we will be your culture. We'll be a culture

05:03:05.960 --> 05:03:07.960
[Guest 1]: lab. We will come and tell you what

05:03:07.960 --> 05:03:09.960
[Guest 1]: to do in culture. Who should be executed?

05:03:09.960 --> 05:03:11.960
[Guest 1]: No. The best person should

05:03:11.960 --> 05:03:13.960
[Guest 1]: be executed. But typical advertising

05:03:13.960 --> 05:03:15.960
[Guest 1]: behavior is, do all this with me.

05:03:15.960 --> 05:03:17.960
[Guest 1]: I'll make the song, I'll write the ad,

05:03:17.960 --> 05:03:19.960
[Guest 1]: I'll do this. It doesn't happen, boss.

05:03:19.960 --> 05:03:21.960
[Guest 1]: A lot has changed and to do that,

05:03:21.960 --> 05:03:23.960
[Guest 1]: you will need

05:03:23.960 --> 05:03:25.960
[Guest 1]: to actually spread

05:03:25.960 --> 05:03:27.960
[Guest 1]: your wings higher and

05:03:27.960 --> 05:03:29.960
[Guest 1]: ally with a lot more people.

05:03:29.960 --> 05:03:31.960
[Guest 1]: Break these big

05:03:31.960 --> 05:03:33.960
[Guest 1]: walls that you are doing or whatever. And I'm telling you,

05:03:33.960 --> 05:03:35.960
[Guest 1]: it's happening.

05:03:35.960 --> 05:03:37.960
[Guest 1]: Marketers really, and

05:03:37.960 --> 05:03:39.960
[Guest 1]: some marketers are really waking up to it.

05:03:39.960 --> 05:03:41.960
[Guest 1]: I genuinely value them. I value them by

05:03:41.960 --> 05:03:43.960
[Guest 1]: giving them more time. I value them by

05:03:43.960 --> 05:03:45.960
[Guest 1]: sending my best ideas to them, provoking

05:03:45.960 --> 05:03:47.960
[Guest 2]: them. You are making a very important point.

05:03:47.960 --> 05:03:49.960
[Guest 2]: The structure of marketing needs to change. Absolutely.

05:03:49.960 --> 05:03:51.960
[Guest 2]: That means

05:03:51.960 --> 05:03:53.960
[Guest 2]: it has to come from the education of marketing

05:03:53.960 --> 05:03:55.960
[Guest 2]: as well.

05:03:55.960 --> 05:03:57.960
[Unknown]: Very true.

05:03:57.960 --> 05:03:59.960
[Unknown]: So, let's go back to

05:03:59.960 --> 05:04:01.960
[Unknown]: cricket lessons and life

05:04:01.960 --> 05:04:03.960
[Guest 2]: lessons.

05:04:03.960 --> 05:04:05.960
[Amit Varma]: One point that... No, I say very true.

05:04:05.960 --> 05:04:07.960
[Amit Varma]: The reason I don't have

05:04:07.960 --> 05:04:09.960
[Amit Varma]: a particular response to it is that I think

05:04:09.960 --> 05:04:11.960
[Amit Varma]: that a lot of what you said is stuff that I will

05:04:11.960 --> 05:04:13.960
[Amit Varma]: re-listen to and process over

05:04:13.960 --> 05:04:15.960
[Guest 2]: a period of time and we'll continue this conversation.

05:04:15.960 --> 05:04:17.960
[Guest 2]: That was your struggle as well, right?

05:04:17.960 --> 05:04:19.960
[Amit Varma]: Selling your content.

05:04:19.960 --> 05:04:21.960
[Amit Varma]: He doesn't go and sell. No, you don't go and sponsor.

05:04:21.960 --> 05:04:23.960
[Amit Varma]: See, what I have really decided

05:04:23.960 --> 05:04:25.960
[Amit Varma]: as far as sales is concerned that I won't do it.

05:04:25.960 --> 05:04:27.960
[Unknown]: Exactly. I'm a product guy.

05:04:27.960 --> 05:04:29.960
[Unknown]: Product is best marketing.

05:04:29.960 --> 05:04:31.960
[Unknown]: So, I won't do sales or marketing.

05:04:31.960 --> 05:04:33.960
[Amit Varma]: Now, some advertisers come

05:04:33.960 --> 05:04:35.960
[Amit Varma]: themselves and

05:04:35.960 --> 05:04:37.960
[Amit Varma]: some of them will put a code unseen

05:04:37.960 --> 05:04:39.960
[Amit Varma]: and then they will realize that, hey, it's really worked.

05:04:39.960 --> 05:04:41.960
[Amit Varma]: So, I get repeat marketing. You know, so, there's this

05:04:41.960 --> 05:04:43.960
[Amit Varma]: company called The Great Courses Plus which renamed

05:04:43.960 --> 05:04:45.960
[Amit Varma]: themselves Vandrium. So, they advertise with

05:04:45.960 --> 05:04:47.960
[Amit Varma]: me for a year and then

05:04:47.960 --> 05:04:49.960
[Amit Varma]: last year in September, they said

05:04:49.960 --> 05:04:51.960
[Amit Varma]: we want to buy out all your inventory for

05:04:51.960 --> 05:04:53.960
[Amit Varma]: 2022. So, I was happy.

05:04:53.960 --> 05:04:55.960
[Amit Varma]: I said, okay.

05:04:55.960 --> 05:04:57.960
[Amit Varma]: Because they saw that my commercials had worked

05:04:57.960 --> 05:04:59.960
[Amit Varma]: for them. But then these RBI

05:04:59.960 --> 05:05:01.960
[Amit Varma]: regulations on recurring payments came

05:05:01.960 --> 05:05:03.960
[Amit Varma]: in and they changed their mind

05:05:03.960 --> 05:05:05.960
[Amit Varma]: because they said that now the client is saying

05:05:05.960 --> 05:05:07.960
[Amit Varma]: that all the customers

05:05:07.960 --> 05:05:09.960
[Amit Varma]: in India, they probably

05:05:09.960 --> 05:05:11.960
[Amit Varma]: won't be able to pay anyway. So, let us

05:05:11.960 --> 05:05:13.960
[Amit Varma]: suspend it. We'll discuss it when the problem is

05:05:13.960 --> 05:05:15.960
[Amit Varma]: resolved. So, I lost a massive

05:05:15.960 --> 05:05:17.960
[Amit Varma]: chunk of money because of the freaking RBI.

05:05:17.960 --> 05:05:19.960
[Guest 2]: But that's

05:05:19.960 --> 05:05:20.960
[Guest 2]: okay. I mean, the way...

05:05:20.960 --> 05:05:22.960
[Guest 2]: Roshan, give him a 10% stake.

05:05:24.960 --> 05:05:26.960
[Unknown]: I'll give Roshan a 10% stake.

05:05:26.960 --> 05:05:28.960
[Unknown]: Roshan will ask, what's the value?

05:05:28.960 --> 05:05:30.960
[Amit Varma]: I'll say, sir, what can the value be?

05:05:30.960 --> 05:05:32.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but

05:05:32.960 --> 05:05:34.960
[Amit Varma]: my story is, I love what I'm doing. It's a

05:05:34.960 --> 05:05:36.960
[Amit Varma]: labor of love. Whatever comes in

05:05:36.960 --> 05:05:38.960
[Amit Varma]: is a kind of a bonus. But I've always been very

05:05:38.960 --> 05:05:40.960
[Guest 1]: impractical. I'm going to throw that back

05:05:40.960 --> 05:05:42.960
[Guest 1]: at you in terms of saying, what are some lessons

05:05:42.960 --> 05:05:44.960
[Guest 1]: that you have picked up? Because you are

05:05:44.960 --> 05:05:46.960
[Guest 1]: interacting every week with such

05:05:46.960 --> 05:05:48.960
[Guest 1]: wonderful people that

05:05:48.960 --> 05:05:50.960
[Guest 1]: if I was to say, what are five lessons

05:05:50.960 --> 05:05:52.960
[Guest 1]: that you have picked up? And

05:05:52.960 --> 05:05:54.960
[Guest 1]: I couldn't say it over 300 episodes.

05:05:54.960 --> 05:05:56.960
[Guest 1]: But what would you say over

05:05:56.960 --> 05:05:58.960
[Guest 1]: this year? Over all of

05:05:58.960 --> 05:06:00.960
[Amit Varma]: 2022? So, at the

05:06:00.960 --> 05:06:02.960
[Amit Varma]: end of the episode, we were going to have this section where we all

05:06:02.960 --> 05:06:04.960
[Amit Varma]: give advice to youngsters and I had a bunch

05:06:04.960 --> 05:06:06.960
[Amit Varma]: of points for that. But I won't look at that.

05:06:06.960 --> 05:06:08.960
[Amit Varma]: I would rather, like, since you asked me,

05:06:08.960 --> 05:06:10.960
[Amit Varma]: I think I've learned to

05:06:10.960 --> 05:06:12.960
[Amit Varma]: listen better,

05:06:12.960 --> 05:06:14.960
[Amit Varma]: become a better

05:06:14.960 --> 05:06:16.960
[Amit Varma]: listener. I've learned to be a little bit...

05:06:16.960 --> 05:06:18.960
[Amit Varma]: I've learned to be less judgmental,

05:06:18.960 --> 05:06:20.960
[Amit Varma]: which is very important. But that's

05:06:20.960 --> 05:06:22.960
[Amit Varma]: more a life lesson that I think just comes

05:06:22.960 --> 05:06:24.960
[Amit Varma]: with growing older and not necessarily because

05:06:24.960 --> 05:06:26.960
[Amit Varma]: of the show.

05:06:26.960 --> 05:06:28.960
[Amit Varma]: But I've also learned,

05:06:28.960 --> 05:06:30.960
[Amit Varma]: over the last year, especially as I've done

05:06:30.960 --> 05:06:32.960
[Amit Varma]: these long oral history kind of

05:06:32.960 --> 05:06:34.960
[Amit Varma]: episodes, is that

05:06:34.960 --> 05:06:36.960
[Amit Varma]: what I really like best is the stories

05:06:36.960 --> 05:06:38.960
[Amit Varma]: of people. The stories that

05:06:38.960 --> 05:06:40.960
[Amit Varma]: people tell about themselves. And I find many

05:06:40.960 --> 05:06:42.960
[Amit Varma]: of my listeners will echo this and some won't.

05:06:42.960 --> 05:06:44.960
[Amit Varma]: Where, you know, my thing

05:06:44.960 --> 05:06:46.960
[Amit Varma]: is, if you want to listen to subject X

05:06:46.960 --> 05:06:48.960
[Amit Varma]: on... to person X

05:06:48.960 --> 05:06:50.960
[Unknown]: on subject Y, you can search

05:06:50.960 --> 05:06:52.960
[Amit Varma]: on YouTube. You'll find thousands.

05:06:52.960 --> 05:06:54.960
[Amit Varma]: But if you really want to understand

05:06:54.960 --> 05:06:56.960
[Amit Varma]: someone's life, how they grew up,

05:06:56.960 --> 05:06:58.960
[Amit Varma]: their vulnerabilities, their insecurities,

05:06:58.960 --> 05:07:00.960
[Amit Varma]: their turning points, you don't really

05:07:00.960 --> 05:07:02.960
[Amit Varma]: get that anywhere else. Just

05:07:02.960 --> 05:07:04.960
[Amit Varma]: that personal touch. Like Ninal Pandey

05:07:04.960 --> 05:07:06.960
[Amit Varma]: came on the show and I asked my

05:07:06.960 --> 05:07:08.960
[Amit Varma]: first question about her childhood. She spoke for

05:07:08.960 --> 05:07:10.960
[Unknown]: one hour, ten minutes. She spoke

05:07:10.960 --> 05:07:12.960
[Amit Varma]: for one hour, ten minutes and she took

05:07:12.960 --> 05:07:14.960
[Amit Varma]: me from the 50s to the 70s. She

05:07:14.960 --> 05:07:16.960
[Amit Varma]: covered 30 years and it was

05:07:16.960 --> 05:07:18.960
[Amit Varma]: magical. Talking about her

05:07:18.960 --> 05:07:20.960
[Amit Varma]: mother, talking about her sister, talking

05:07:20.960 --> 05:07:22.960
[Amit Varma]: about her early childhood years.

05:07:22.960 --> 05:07:24.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, the first time they were at a balcony and

05:07:24.960 --> 05:07:26.960
[Amit Varma]: a group of people were going past in the early

05:07:26.960 --> 05:07:28.960
[Amit Varma]: 50s and she asked her mother,

05:07:28.960 --> 05:07:30.960
[Amit Varma]: what is that? Or her grandmother, what are

05:07:30.960 --> 05:07:32.960
[Amit Varma]: these people? And the grandmother

05:07:32.960 --> 05:07:34.960
[Amit Varma]: said, Re-pu-jis.

05:07:34.960 --> 05:07:36.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, and she repeats it like that to me

05:07:36.960 --> 05:07:38.960
[Amit Varma]: 70 years later. And

05:07:38.960 --> 05:07:40.960
[Amit Varma]: for me, those moments are magical

05:07:40.960 --> 05:07:42.960
[Amit Varma]: when you have a person

05:07:42.960 --> 05:07:44.960
[Amit Varma]: revealing themselves. Like Nikhil did so much

05:07:44.960 --> 05:07:46.960
[Amit Varma]: in his episode. Nikhil Taneja,

05:07:46.960 --> 05:07:48.960
[Amit Varma]: The Loneliness of the Indian Man. And I think

05:07:48.960 --> 05:07:50.960
[Amit Varma]: that, for me, that's

05:07:50.960 --> 05:07:52.960
[Amit Varma]: kind of special. Just listening to these

05:07:52.960 --> 05:07:54.960
[Amit Varma]: and these human connections.

05:07:54.960 --> 05:07:56.960
[Amit Varma]: And many of my listeners agree, you know.

05:07:56.960 --> 05:07:58.960
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure I've lost

05:07:58.960 --> 05:08:00.960
[Amit Varma]: some listeners because I don't do two hour

05:08:00.960 --> 05:08:02.960
[Amit Varma]: deep dives into subjects, I do five hour deep

05:08:02.960 --> 05:08:04.960
[Amit Varma]: dives into people. But that's just

05:08:04.960 --> 05:08:06.960
[Amit Varma]: a direction that I like to go

05:08:06.960 --> 05:08:08.960
[Amit Varma]: and I think that's kind of

05:08:08.960 --> 05:08:10.960
[Amit Varma]: value to me. And I'm wondering

05:08:10.960 --> 05:08:12.960
[Amit Varma]: if that's also

05:08:12.960 --> 05:08:14.960
[Amit Varma]: something that happened with you

05:08:14.960 --> 05:08:16.960
[Amit Varma]: Vikram, in the course of, as we get back to your

05:08:16.960 --> 05:08:18.960
[Amit Varma]: cricket lessons, but in the course of your

05:08:18.960 --> 05:08:20.960
[Amit Varma]: interacting with cricket,

05:08:20.960 --> 05:08:22.960
[Amit Varma]: where at one level

05:08:22.960 --> 05:08:24.960
[Amit Varma]: when you go into it, you

05:08:24.960 --> 05:08:26.960
[Amit Varma]: see that these guys are almost larger

05:08:26.960 --> 05:08:28.960
[Amit Varma]: than life, right? Tendulkar,

05:08:28.960 --> 05:08:30.960
[Amit Varma]: Dravid, Kumle. I mean, they're just, you know,

05:08:30.960 --> 05:08:32.960
[Amit Varma]: I still remember Kumle with

05:08:32.960 --> 05:08:34.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, we were doing live

05:08:34.960 --> 05:08:36.960
[Amit Varma]: bulletins for a test match in the West Indies

05:08:36.960 --> 05:08:38.960
[Amit Varma]: where he broke his jaw and he went out to bowl with

05:08:38.960 --> 05:08:40.960
[Amit Varma]: that, you know. And that makes him so

05:08:40.960 --> 05:08:42.960
[Amit Varma]: much larger than life. But then you're responding to

05:08:42.960 --> 05:08:44.960
[Amit Varma]: them as people and you're seeing their frailties

05:08:44.960 --> 05:08:46.960
[Amit Varma]: and their weaknesses and you're learning

05:08:46.960 --> 05:08:48.960
[Amit Varma]: lessons from that, which of course we'll go back to

05:08:48.960 --> 05:08:50.960
[Amit Varma]: now. But what has been

05:08:50.960 --> 05:08:52.960
[Amit Varma]: your sense through this time

05:08:52.960 --> 05:08:54.960
[Amit Varma]: of relating to people as people? And the reason

05:08:54.960 --> 05:08:56.960
[Amit Varma]: I ask that is that I think

05:08:56.960 --> 05:08:58.960
[Amit Varma]: what I did when I was younger,

05:08:58.960 --> 05:09:00.960
[Amit Varma]: and I don't want to generalize about whether young people

05:09:00.960 --> 05:09:02.960
[Amit Varma]: do it, but I think all people do it to an extent,

05:09:02.960 --> 05:09:04.960
[Amit Varma]: is that you are the

05:09:04.960 --> 05:09:06.960
[Amit Varma]: center of the world, right?

05:09:06.960 --> 05:09:08.960
[Amit Varma]: You are the, you're playing the lead role

05:09:08.960 --> 05:09:10.960
[Amit Varma]: in the play in your head. Everybody

05:09:10.960 --> 05:09:12.960
[Amit Varma]: else is a prop or a side character, but

05:09:12.960 --> 05:09:14.960
[Amit Varma]: you are everything. You look at people

05:09:14.960 --> 05:09:16.960
[Amit Varma]: only in the sense that they are instrumental

05:09:16.960 --> 05:09:18.960
[Amit Varma]: to you or they are important for your story,

05:09:18.960 --> 05:09:20.960
[Amit Varma]: but not as people themselves.

05:09:20.960 --> 05:09:22.960
[Amit Varma]: And then I think what I have

05:09:22.960 --> 05:09:24.960
[Amit Varma]: learnt most of all through my journey

05:09:24.960 --> 05:09:26.960
[Amit Varma]: is to just have

05:09:26.960 --> 05:09:28.960
[Amit Varma]: that humility and to respond to

05:09:28.960 --> 05:09:30.960
[Amit Varma]: people as people, which obviously

05:09:30.960 --> 05:09:32.960
[Amit Varma]: listening to their stories

05:09:32.960 --> 05:09:34.960
[Amit Varma]: helps me do a lot. So how has that

05:09:34.960 --> 05:09:36.960
[Guest 2]: journey been for you guys? Absolutely.

05:09:36.960 --> 05:09:38.960
[Guest 2]: And the joy that you

05:09:38.960 --> 05:09:40.960
[Guest 2]: get unraveling people and

05:09:40.960 --> 05:09:42.960
[Guest 2]: kind of understanding

05:09:42.960 --> 05:09:44.960
[Guest 2]: their stories is exactly the joy

05:09:44.960 --> 05:09:46.960
[Guest 2]: I got in the journey of covering cricket

05:09:46.960 --> 05:09:48.960
[Guest 2]: is because

05:09:48.960 --> 05:09:50.960
[Guest 2]: when you meet people who you

05:09:50.960 --> 05:09:52.960
[Guest 2]: admire because of the nature of the profession

05:09:52.960 --> 05:09:54.960
[Guest 2]: they are in, you realize that

05:09:54.960 --> 05:09:56.960
[Guest 2]: you in your normal

05:09:56.960 --> 05:09:58.960
[Guest 2]: life are noticing people

05:09:58.960 --> 05:10:00.960
[Guest 2]: in relatively low pressure

05:10:00.960 --> 05:10:02.960
[Guest 2]: zones. But sport

05:10:02.960 --> 05:10:04.960
[Guest 2]: is, it's gladiatorial,

05:10:04.960 --> 05:10:06.960
[Guest 2]: right? You notice people in high

05:10:06.960 --> 05:10:08.960
[Guest 2]: pressure zones. And unlike

05:10:08.960 --> 05:10:10.960
[Guest 2]: your profession,

05:10:10.960 --> 05:10:12.960
[Guest 2]: that is why, what is the most exciting

05:10:12.960 --> 05:10:14.960
[Guest 2]: thing about high performance careers, right?

05:10:14.960 --> 05:10:16.960
[Guest 2]: People who are astronauts, or for that

05:10:16.960 --> 05:10:18.960
[Guest 2]: matter, mountaineers and cricketers

05:10:18.960 --> 05:10:20.960
[Guest 2]: and stuff like that, that when you

05:10:20.960 --> 05:10:22.960
[Guest 2]: unravel them,

05:10:22.960 --> 05:10:24.960
[Guest 2]: the quality of the insight

05:10:24.960 --> 05:10:26.960
[Guest 2]: is phenomenal.

05:10:26.960 --> 05:10:28.960
[Guest 2]: It just opens your mind and says,

05:10:28.960 --> 05:10:30.960
[Guest 2]: Oh, this can also happen. In normal

05:10:30.960 --> 05:10:32.960
[Guest 2]: circumstances, how much do we visualize?

05:10:32.960 --> 05:10:34.960
[Guest 2]: But when you hear a story of a

05:10:34.960 --> 05:10:36.960
[Guest 2]: cricketer or a basketball player visualizing,

05:10:36.960 --> 05:10:38.960
[Guest 2]: the impact

05:10:38.960 --> 05:10:40.960
[Guest 2]: of that concept hits you harder.

05:10:40.960 --> 05:10:42.960
[Guest 2]: So when you talk to maybe

05:10:42.960 --> 05:10:44.960
[Guest 2]: an economist or for that matter, somebody who

05:10:44.960 --> 05:10:46.960
[Guest 2]: has been a foreign secretary, you know

05:10:46.960 --> 05:10:48.960
[Guest 2]: it's a high pressure zone that the person

05:10:48.960 --> 05:10:50.960
[Guest 2]: has performed. And therefore, the

05:10:50.960 --> 05:10:52.960
[Guest 2]: higher the pressure, the

05:10:52.960 --> 05:10:54.960
[Guest 2]: more interesting the story gets.

05:10:54.960 --> 05:10:56.960
[Guest 2]: This is what I have realized. And because

05:10:56.960 --> 05:10:58.960
[Guest 2]: you love a particular sport

05:10:58.960 --> 05:11:00.960
[Guest 2]: or for that matter, a particular

05:11:00.960 --> 05:11:02.960
[Guest 2]: profession, when you start

05:11:02.960 --> 05:11:04.960
[Guest 2]: entering their world

05:11:04.960 --> 05:11:06.960
[Guest 2]: and what is our joy, right? And I think

05:11:06.960 --> 05:11:08.960
[Guest 2]: we share this thing.

05:11:08.960 --> 05:11:10.960
[Guest 2]: We like to go into other people's world.

05:11:10.960 --> 05:11:12.960
[Guest 2]: And that's why you read so many books,

05:11:12.960 --> 05:11:14.960
[Guest 2]: right? What is a book? A book

05:11:14.960 --> 05:11:16.960
[Guest 2]: basically is transporting you to

05:11:16.960 --> 05:11:18.960
[Guest 2]: a different profession, a different person,

05:11:18.960 --> 05:11:20.960
[Guest 2]: a different thought process where you are

05:11:20.960 --> 05:11:22.960
[Guest 2]: saying, Boss, if I read

05:11:22.960 --> 05:11:24.960
[Guest 2]: a book by an economist, I became an economist.

05:11:24.960 --> 05:11:26.960
[Guest 2]: If I read a book by a cricketer, I became a cricketer.

05:11:26.960 --> 05:11:28.960
[Guest 2]: So somewhere it's a voyeuristic

05:11:28.960 --> 05:11:30.960
[Guest 2]: way in which

05:11:30.960 --> 05:11:32.960
[Guest 2]: you live other people. And that's why I like

05:11:32.960 --> 05:11:34.960
[Guest 2]: autobiographies. And that's why when I went into

05:11:34.960 --> 05:11:36.960
[Guest 2]: his world and I'm saying that, Boss, I'm

05:11:36.960 --> 05:11:38.960
[Guest 2]: sitting with a guy

05:11:38.960 --> 05:11:40.960
[Guest 2]: who's actually scored the 100 100s.

05:11:40.960 --> 05:11:42.960
[Guest 2]: And now he

05:11:42.960 --> 05:11:44.960
[Guest 2]: will tell me, Boss, what happened?

05:11:44.960 --> 05:11:46.960
[Guest 2]: Now when he tells me what happened,

05:11:46.960 --> 05:11:48.960
[Guest 2]: my dopamine

05:11:48.960 --> 05:11:50.960
[Guest 2]: goes to the dope level.

05:11:52.960 --> 05:11:54.960
[Unknown]: Because I'm thinking,

05:11:54.960 --> 05:11:56.960
[Guest 2]: he told me that story.

05:11:56.960 --> 05:11:58.960
[Guest 2]: It feels good to hear a story.

05:11:58.960 --> 05:12:00.960
[Guest 2]: We are all in the story business.

05:12:00.960 --> 05:12:02.960
[Guest 2]: So

05:12:02.960 --> 05:12:04.960
[Guest 2]: that is why when What the Duck happened,

05:12:04.960 --> 05:12:06.960
[Guest 2]: What the Duck moment for me

05:12:06.960 --> 05:12:08.960
[Guest 2]: was like your scene and the unseen moment.

05:12:08.960 --> 05:12:10.960
[Guest 2]: Where you're going and asking them questions

05:12:10.960 --> 05:12:12.960
[Guest 2]: and they are putting down

05:12:12.960 --> 05:12:14.960
[Guest 2]: their entire life story.

05:12:14.960 --> 05:12:16.960
[Guest 2]: But I don't deep dive that much.

05:12:16.960 --> 05:12:18.960
[Guest 2]: I had 45 minutes to an hour.

05:12:18.960 --> 05:12:20.960
[Guest 2]: So my curation was way more

05:12:20.960 --> 05:12:22.960
[Guest 2]: because they are people with limited

05:12:22.960 --> 05:12:24.960
[Guest 2]: time and they would not like to share their life.

05:12:24.960 --> 05:12:26.960
[Guest 2]: And they would not like

05:12:26.960 --> 05:12:28.960
[Guest 2]: to share their life in public. They would share that

05:12:28.960 --> 05:12:30.960
[Guest 2]: with me over a drink or whatever

05:12:30.960 --> 05:12:32.960
[Guest 2]: and stuff like that. But when you

05:12:32.960 --> 05:12:34.960
[Guest 2]: hear those insights, the joy you

05:12:34.960 --> 05:12:36.960
[Guest 2]: get is what makes this

05:12:36.960 --> 05:12:38.960
[Guest 2]: entire activity special.

05:12:38.960 --> 05:12:40.960
[Guest 2]: You talk about work ethic. One of the biggest

05:12:40.960 --> 05:12:42.960
[Guest 2]: events I have done from a

05:12:42.960 --> 05:12:44.960
[Guest 2]: sheer happiness point of

05:12:44.960 --> 05:12:46.960
[Guest 2]: view is a concert that

05:12:46.960 --> 05:12:48.960
[Guest 2]: we did where

05:12:48.960 --> 05:12:50.960
[Guest 1]: Sachin Tendulkar was in conversation with

05:12:50.960 --> 05:12:52.960
[Guest 2]: Ustad Zakir Hussain.

05:12:52.960 --> 05:12:54.960
[Guest 2]: Man, to me that three days

05:12:54.960 --> 05:12:56.960
[Guest 2]: of sitting with Zakir Hussain and Sachin

05:12:56.960 --> 05:12:58.960
[Guest 2]: Tendulkar curating this show

05:12:58.960 --> 05:13:00.960
[Guest 2]: and what they will be speaking. It's a tough

05:13:00.960 --> 05:13:02.960
[Guest 2]: one, right? One is a cricketer, one is a tabla

05:13:02.960 --> 05:13:04.960
[Guest 2]: maestro. But I

05:13:04.960 --> 05:13:06.960
[Guest 2]: want to get them to

05:13:06.960 --> 05:13:08.960
[Guest 2]: common points where they talk about them

05:13:08.960 --> 05:13:10.960
[Guest 2]: and then the final

05:13:10.960 --> 05:13:12.960
[Guest 2]: output should be, oh my god.

05:13:12.960 --> 05:13:14.960
[Guest 2]: So it was just amazing

05:13:14.960 --> 05:13:16.960
[Guest 2]: because Zakir Hussain was saying things

05:13:16.960 --> 05:13:18.960
[Guest 2]: about his life which were like

05:13:18.960 --> 05:13:20.960
[Guest 2]: wow, what a story that he told.

05:13:20.960 --> 05:13:22.960
[Guest 2]: Imagine, this is Sachin, this is Zakir

05:13:22.960 --> 05:13:24.960
[Guest 2]: Hussain, this is me, this is Sunandan

05:13:24.960 --> 05:13:26.960
[Guest 2]: and a conversation is happening

05:13:26.960 --> 05:13:28.960
[Guest 2]: where Zakir Hussain is saying that

05:13:28.960 --> 05:13:30.960
[Guest 2]: Sachin, first show me your hands.

05:13:30.960 --> 05:13:32.960
[Guest 2]: And he showed his hands and

05:13:32.960 --> 05:13:34.960
[Guest 2]: Zakir Hussain touched his hand

05:13:34.960 --> 05:13:36.960
[Guest 2]: and said that just give me 30 seconds.

05:13:36.960 --> 05:13:38.960
[Guest 2]: The hands

05:13:38.960 --> 05:13:40.960
[Guest 2]: that made 100

05:13:40.960 --> 05:13:42.960
[Guest 2]: let the power of those hands go into my hands.

05:13:42.960 --> 05:13:44.960
[Guest 2]: By doing this, he held his

05:13:44.960 --> 05:13:46.960
[Guest 2]: hand for 30 seconds. And Zakir is a

05:13:46.960 --> 05:13:48.960
[Guest 2]: maestro, right? At all levels

05:13:48.960 --> 05:13:50.960
[Guest 2]: he is a charming man.

05:13:50.960 --> 05:13:52.960
[Guest 2]: And then he said that actually

05:13:52.960 --> 05:13:54.960
[Guest 2]: these hands were also mine.

05:13:54.960 --> 05:13:56.960
[Guest 2]: So I said, Zakir bhai, why are you saying this?

05:13:56.960 --> 05:13:58.960
[Guest 2]: I was a wicket keeper in Shivaji Park.

05:13:58.960 --> 05:14:00.960
[Guest 2]: And we used to live in Mahim.

05:14:00.960 --> 05:14:02.960
[Guest 2]: I used to play regular cricket.

05:14:02.960 --> 05:14:04.960
[Guest 2]: I was a good wicket keeper.

05:14:04.960 --> 05:14:06.960
[Guest 2]: One day, while collecting the ball

05:14:06.960 --> 05:14:08.960
[Guest 2]: on my left hand,

05:14:08.960 --> 05:14:10.960
[Guest 2]: when I came home,

05:14:10.960 --> 05:14:12.960
[Guest 2]: Baba said

05:14:12.960 --> 05:14:14.960
[Guest 2]: that son, come here.

05:14:14.960 --> 05:14:16.960
[Guest 2]: Your hands

05:14:16.960 --> 05:14:18.960
[Guest 2]: are not made to collect the ball.

05:14:20.960 --> 05:14:22.960
[Guest 2]: What you can see

05:14:22.960 --> 05:14:24.960
[Guest 2]: your hands are made to

05:14:24.960 --> 05:14:26.960
[Guest 2]: collect the ball.

05:14:26.960 --> 05:14:28.960
[Guest 2]: And he said for me that was a day where I felt

05:14:28.960 --> 05:14:30.960
[Guest 2]: really hurt because my cricket was being

05:14:30.960 --> 05:14:32.960
[Guest 2]: taken away from me because I loved wicket keeping.

05:14:32.960 --> 05:14:34.960
[Guest 2]: And then they had a conversation

05:14:34.960 --> 05:14:36.960
[Guest 2]: about

05:14:36.960 --> 05:14:38.960
[Guest 2]: the sound of the tabla.

05:14:38.960 --> 05:14:40.960
[Guest 2]: And then Sachin said,

05:14:40.960 --> 05:14:42.960
[Guest 2]: for both of us, sound is important.

05:14:42.960 --> 05:14:44.960
[Guest 2]: Because there is

05:14:44.960 --> 05:14:46.960
[Guest 2]: twice in the net when you get that.

05:14:46.960 --> 05:14:48.960
[Guest 2]: And you know the sound

05:14:48.960 --> 05:14:50.960
[Guest 2]: is where an indicator

05:14:50.960 --> 05:14:52.960
[Guest 2]: of whether you are in form or not.

05:14:52.960 --> 05:14:54.960
[Guest 2]: And he said exactly, when we come to the sum,

05:14:54.960 --> 05:14:56.960
[Guest 2]: when we play the tabla

05:14:56.960 --> 05:14:58.960
[Guest 2]: with that sound.

05:14:58.960 --> 05:15:00.960
[Guest 2]: Amit, this went on and I am like

05:15:00.960 --> 05:15:02.960
[Amit Varma]: wow, wow, wow, wow.

05:15:02.960 --> 05:15:04.960
[Guest 2]: And you are also a tabla player and a batsman yourself.

05:15:04.960 --> 05:15:06.960
[Guest 2]: Again, I am a failed tabla player

05:15:06.960 --> 05:15:08.960
[Guest 2]: and a failed cricketer. So I appreciate this more.

05:15:08.960 --> 05:15:10.960
[Guest 2]: And then Zakir Bhai said

05:15:10.960 --> 05:15:12.960
[Guest 2]: something interesting. He said,

05:15:12.960 --> 05:15:14.960
[Guest 2]: Sachin, do you remember you made 241

05:15:14.960 --> 05:15:16.960
[Guest 2]: when you

05:15:16.960 --> 05:15:18.960
[Guest 2]: hit the upper cut

05:15:18.960 --> 05:15:20.960
[Guest 2]: of Brett Lee's short ball.

05:15:20.960 --> 05:15:22.960
[Guest 2]: In our profession,

05:15:22.960 --> 05:15:24.960
[Guest 2]: that is called coming to the sum.

05:15:24.960 --> 05:15:26.960
[Guest 2]: When

05:15:26.960 --> 05:15:28.960
[Guest 2]: that sound comes,

05:15:28.960 --> 05:15:30.960
[Guest 2]: when it comes out of the tabla,

05:15:30.960 --> 05:15:32.960
[Guest 2]: then you are in form.

05:15:32.960 --> 05:15:34.960
[Unknown]: And then they went on.

05:15:34.960 --> 05:15:36.960
[Guest 1]: And then Tendulkar played that instrument.

05:15:36.960 --> 05:15:38.960
[Guest 2]: He played that instrument.

05:15:38.960 --> 05:15:40.960
[Guest 2]: We curated that as well.

05:15:40.960 --> 05:15:42.960
[Guest 2]: And then it went on

05:15:42.960 --> 05:15:44.960
[Guest 2]: and then I, standard work

05:15:44.960 --> 05:15:46.960
[Guest 2]: ethic question, so I asked

05:15:46.960 --> 05:15:48.960
[Guest 2]: Zakir Bhai that

05:15:48.960 --> 05:15:50.960
[Guest 2]: how many hours do you practice?

05:15:50.960 --> 05:15:52.960
[Guest 2]: I was looking for 12 hours

05:15:52.960 --> 05:15:54.960
[Guest 2]: and 14 hours. He looked

05:15:54.960 --> 05:15:56.960
[Guest 2]: at me and said, sometimes

05:15:56.960 --> 05:15:58.960
[Guest 2]: we stop.

05:15:58.960 --> 05:16:00.960
[Guest 2]: Then I went

05:16:00.960 --> 05:16:02.960
[Guest 2]: and said, what are you saying?

05:16:02.960 --> 05:16:04.960
[Guest 2]: He said that a good artist

05:16:04.960 --> 05:16:06.960
[Guest 2]: never stops practicing.

05:16:06.960 --> 05:16:08.960
[Guest 2]: When you

05:16:08.960 --> 05:16:10.960
[Guest 2]: sit on the tabla, it comes out.

05:16:10.960 --> 05:16:12.960
[Guest 2]: But

05:16:12.960 --> 05:16:14.960
[Guest 2]: when you practice so many ragas

05:16:14.960 --> 05:16:16.960
[Guest 2]: in your mind, then

05:16:16.960 --> 05:16:18.960
[Guest 2]: there is no time for you

05:16:18.960 --> 05:16:20.960
[Guest 2]: to not be in it.

05:16:20.960 --> 05:16:22.960
[Guest 2]: When you sit on a concert,

05:16:22.960 --> 05:16:24.960
[Guest 2]: your image is already there

05:16:24.960 --> 05:16:26.960
[Guest 2]: and you join it

05:16:26.960 --> 05:16:28.960
[Guest 2]: and it comes out through the tabla.

05:16:28.960 --> 05:16:30.960
[Guest 2]: So work ethic

05:16:30.960 --> 05:16:32.960
[Guest 2]: is the same thing

05:16:32.960 --> 05:16:34.960
[Guest 2]: in whose mind it goes on.

05:16:34.960 --> 05:16:36.960
[Guest 2]: Imagine Sachin Tendulkar said, yeah, you are always

05:16:36.960 --> 05:16:38.960
[Guest 2]: batting. And to me,

05:16:38.960 --> 05:16:40.960
[Guest 2]: he

05:16:40.960 --> 05:16:42.960
[Guest 2]: making one point, this guy

05:16:42.960 --> 05:16:44.960
[Guest 2]: making and he said that, you know,

05:16:44.960 --> 05:16:46.960
[Guest 2]: as a kid, I didn't know when I was stopping

05:16:46.960 --> 05:16:48.960
[Guest 2]: batting because I was always playing

05:16:48.960 --> 05:16:50.960
[Guest 2]: the ball in my head.

05:16:50.960 --> 05:16:52.960
[Guest 2]: Even Kohli talks about it.

05:16:52.960 --> 05:16:54.960
[Guest 2]: The fact that my success

05:16:54.960 --> 05:16:56.960
[Guest 2]: he says is because of the fact that

05:16:56.960 --> 05:16:58.960
[Guest 2]: I am constantly practicing.

05:16:58.960 --> 05:17:00.960
[Guest 2]: Whether you are practicing actually or

05:17:00.960 --> 05:17:02.960
[Guest 2]: practicing in your brain does not matter.

05:17:02.960 --> 05:17:04.960
[Guest 2]: And that kind of

05:17:04.960 --> 05:17:06.960
[Guest 2]: you know,

05:17:06.960 --> 05:17:08.960
[Guest 2]: this entire journey of experiencing

05:17:08.960 --> 05:17:10.960
[Guest 2]: both professions

05:17:10.960 --> 05:17:12.960
[Guest 2]: but reaching to the common goal of

05:17:12.960 --> 05:17:14.960
[Guest 2]: excellence. When you said work ethic

05:17:14.960 --> 05:17:16.960
[Guest 2]: kind of these were memories that I could

05:17:16.960 --> 05:17:18.960
[Guest 2]: not forget. And there was another one

05:17:18.960 --> 05:17:20.960
[Guest 2]: very interesting memory. Martina Navratilova

05:17:20.960 --> 05:17:22.960
[Guest 2]: I was interviewing in Thailand.

05:17:22.960 --> 05:17:24.960
[Guest 2]: And so

05:17:24.960 --> 05:17:26.960
[Guest 1]: this is again, you know.

05:17:26.960 --> 05:17:28.960
[Guest 1]: While all the dealers are taking massages.

05:17:30.960 --> 05:17:32.960
[Guest 2]: Yeah, and this is

05:17:32.960 --> 05:17:34.960
[Guest 2]: the most important lesson I have

05:17:34.960 --> 05:17:36.960
[Guest 2]: learned in life.

05:17:36.960 --> 05:17:38.960
[Guest 2]: And which has come through sport

05:17:38.960 --> 05:17:40.960
[Guest 2]: but in a sense it kind of is

05:17:40.960 --> 05:17:42.960
[Guest 2]: the most important lesson everybody should

05:17:42.960 --> 05:17:44.960
[Guest 2]: learn about and that is being in the moment.

05:17:44.960 --> 05:17:46.960
[Guest 2]: Right?

05:17:46.960 --> 05:17:48.960
[Guest 2]: So

05:17:48.960 --> 05:17:50.960
[Guest 2]: I asked Martina that you know

05:17:50.960 --> 05:17:52.960
[Guest 2]: when does a sports person

05:17:52.960 --> 05:17:54.960
[Guest 2]: decide to call it a day?

05:17:54.960 --> 05:17:56.960
[Guest 2]: She said it's a very

05:17:56.960 --> 05:17:58.960
[Guest 2]: simple answer.

05:17:58.960 --> 05:18:00.960
[Guest 2]: And it happened to me at Wimbledon.

05:18:00.960 --> 05:18:02.960
[Guest 2]: I was about to serve

05:18:02.960 --> 05:18:04.960
[Guest 2]: and I could hear the plane pass by.

05:18:06.960 --> 05:18:08.960
[Guest 2]: I stopped, again I

05:18:08.960 --> 05:18:10.960
[Guest 2]: tossed the ball and I could hear the plane

05:18:10.960 --> 05:18:12.960
[Guest 2]: pass by again.

05:18:12.960 --> 05:18:14.960
[Guest 2]: And that day she said I decided

05:18:14.960 --> 05:18:16.960
[Amit Varma]: to retire. What an answer.

05:18:16.960 --> 05:18:18.960
[Guest 2]: She said because in my life

05:18:18.960 --> 05:18:20.960
[Guest 2]: when I was at play

05:18:20.960 --> 05:18:22.960
[Guest 2]: I could not hear anything.

05:18:22.960 --> 05:18:24.960
[Guest 2]: And the day I heard

05:18:24.960 --> 05:18:26.960
[Guest 2]: the plane I knew it was time for me.

05:18:26.960 --> 05:18:28.960
[Guest 2]: Ian Chappell said the same thing.

05:18:28.960 --> 05:18:30.960
[Guest 2]: He said Chapelle when did you retire? He said

05:18:30.960 --> 05:18:32.960
[Guest 2]: there was a match in Adelaide

05:18:32.960 --> 05:18:34.960
[Guest 2]: when I was in second slip.

05:18:34.960 --> 05:18:36.960
[Guest 2]: And at around 4.30

05:18:36.960 --> 05:18:38.960
[Guest 2]: I looked at the watch.

05:18:38.960 --> 05:18:40.960
[Guest 2]: And I looked at the watch again at 4.45.

05:18:40.960 --> 05:18:42.960
[Guest 2]: 5.15 I had decided to retire.

05:18:42.960 --> 05:18:44.960
[Guest 2]: Because Martina said

05:18:44.960 --> 05:18:46.960
[Guest 2]: the human mind

05:18:46.960 --> 05:18:48.960
[Guest 2]: has the ability to focus only on

05:18:48.960 --> 05:18:50.960
[Guest 2]: one thing. It's the past, present

05:18:50.960 --> 05:18:52.960
[Guest 2]: or the future. If something is

05:18:52.960 --> 05:18:54.960
[Guest 2]: disturbing your current moment

05:18:54.960 --> 05:18:56.960
[Guest 2]: it's an area of concern.

05:18:56.960 --> 05:18:58.960
[Guest 2]: And you have to evaluate it and you know that

05:18:58.960 --> 05:19:00.960
[Guest 2]: it's not the right day.

05:19:00.960 --> 05:19:02.960
[Guest 2]: And that brings me to an amazing story

05:19:02.960 --> 05:19:04.960
[Guest 2]: of Virendra Sehwag.

05:19:04.960 --> 05:19:06.960
[Guest 2]: Everybody knows about

05:19:06.960 --> 05:19:08.960
[Guest 2]: Veeru singing.

05:19:08.960 --> 05:19:10.960
[Guest 2]: I had a chat with him one day and said

05:19:10.960 --> 05:19:12.960
[Guest 2]: what's the theory of singing?

05:19:12.960 --> 05:19:14.960
[Guest 2]: Before this I had read a very interesting book

05:19:14.960 --> 05:19:16.960
[Guest 2]: by a guy called I think John Galway.

05:19:16.960 --> 05:19:18.960
[Guest 2]: He talks about

05:19:18.960 --> 05:19:20.960
[Guest 2]: the mental state in tennis.

05:19:20.960 --> 05:19:22.960
[Guest 2]: So it's a very interesting thing.

05:19:22.960 --> 05:19:24.960
[Guest 2]: He said when you are playing tennis

05:19:24.960 --> 05:19:26.960
[Guest 2]: you will normally hear

05:19:26.960 --> 05:19:28.960
[Guest 2]: players say what are you doing?

05:19:28.960 --> 05:19:30.960
[Guest 2]: Hit the shot.

05:19:30.960 --> 05:19:32.960
[Guest 2]: I also play tennis so I know that

05:19:32.960 --> 05:19:34.960
[Guest 2]: what he is doing.

05:19:34.960 --> 05:19:36.960
[Guest 2]: So he said there are two states of play

05:19:36.960 --> 05:19:38.960
[Guest 2]: in a human body when you are playing sport.

05:19:38.960 --> 05:19:40.960
[Guest 2]: One is that

05:19:40.960 --> 05:19:42.960
[Guest 2]: self-one which is that guy

05:19:42.960 --> 05:19:44.960
[Guest 2]: who is playing tennis who has honed his skill

05:19:44.960 --> 05:19:46.960
[Guest 2]: over the years and he has allowed

05:19:46.960 --> 05:19:48.960
[Guest 2]: the body to react.

05:19:48.960 --> 05:19:50.960
[Guest 2]: So your ball is coming, you are reacting

05:19:50.960 --> 05:19:52.960
[Guest 2]: because you have learnt it.

05:19:52.960 --> 05:19:54.960
[Guest 2]: The whole system is geared to pick

05:19:54.960 --> 05:19:56.960
[Guest 2]: the ball, length, drive, play the

05:19:56.960 --> 05:19:58.960
[Guest 2]: drop shot or whatever.

05:19:58.960 --> 05:20:00.960
[Guest 2]: Now this is what is

05:20:00.960 --> 05:20:02.960
[Guest 2]: the machine.

05:20:02.960 --> 05:20:04.960
[Guest 2]: Second is a guy called self-two

05:20:04.960 --> 05:20:06.960
[Guest 2]: which is there in the body which is the mind.

05:20:06.960 --> 05:20:08.960
[Guest 2]: This is the most dangerous guy

05:20:08.960 --> 05:20:10.960
[Guest 2]: because this is the guy who is creating

05:20:10.960 --> 05:20:12.960
[Guest 2]: self-doubt in self-one and disallowing

05:20:12.960 --> 05:20:14.960
[Guest 2]: him to play.

05:20:14.960 --> 05:20:16.960
[Guest 2]: So the whole journey of a sportsman

05:20:16.960 --> 05:20:18.960
[Guest 2]: is to keep self-two away

05:20:18.960 --> 05:20:20.960
[Guest 2]: from self-one.

05:20:20.960 --> 05:20:22.960
[Guest 2]: And sledging, and my analysis

05:20:22.960 --> 05:20:24.960
[Guest 2]: is sledging is exactly to

05:20:24.960 --> 05:20:26.960
[Guest 2]: activate self-two. So the moment

05:20:26.960 --> 05:20:28.960
[Guest 2]: a batsman comes into bat and a wicket keeper

05:20:28.960 --> 05:20:30.960
[Guest 2]: says, hey mate, yesterday you couldn't take the

05:20:30.960 --> 05:20:32.960
[Guest 2]: bouncer.

05:20:32.960 --> 05:20:34.960
[Guest 2]: Will tell self-two.

05:20:34.960 --> 05:20:36.960
[Guest 2]: And the moment self-two has said

05:20:36.960 --> 05:20:38.960
[Guest 2]: boss you can't play the bouncer

05:20:38.960 --> 05:20:40.960
[Guest 2]: the entire mind will shift to the fact

05:20:40.960 --> 05:20:42.960
[Guest 2]: that you can't play the bouncer and you

05:20:42.960 --> 05:20:44.960
[Guest 2]: will get out on a bouncer.

05:20:44.960 --> 05:20:46.960
[Guest 2]: So how do you deactivate this

05:20:46.960 --> 05:20:48.960
[Guest 2]: self-doubt fellow to allow your body

05:20:48.960 --> 05:20:50.960
[Guest 2]: to be in the natural state so

05:20:50.960 --> 05:20:52.960
[Guest 2]: that it reacts to the ball at play is

05:20:52.960 --> 05:20:54.960
[Guest 2]: the entire journey of being in the moment.

05:20:54.960 --> 05:20:56.960
[Guest 2]: And that is what a sports

05:20:56.960 --> 05:20:58.960
[Guest 2]: person is trying. And now in

05:20:58.960 --> 05:21:00.960
[Guest 2]: that context, I had read this and that's why if you

05:21:00.960 --> 05:21:02.960
[Guest 2]: see what you have to do is once you play

05:21:02.960 --> 05:21:04.960
[Guest 2]: a tennis shot, tennis players are told to

05:21:04.960 --> 05:21:06.960
[Guest 2]: count the strings of the racket.

05:21:06.960 --> 05:21:08.960
[Guest 2]: This allows you to

05:21:08.960 --> 05:21:10.960
[Guest 2]: worry about the bad shot that you

05:21:10.960 --> 05:21:12.960
[Guest 2]: played and you reduce the

05:21:12.960 --> 05:21:14.960
[Guest 2]: anxiety of the next shot you are going to play.

05:21:14.960 --> 05:21:16.960
[Guest 2]: So that's the logic of being in play.

05:21:16.960 --> 05:21:18.960
[Guest 2]: So when I asked Sehwag

05:21:18.960 --> 05:21:20.960
[Guest 2]: he said, Mr. Sathe, see what happens

05:21:20.960 --> 05:21:22.960
[Guest 2]: your wicket goes between one ball

05:21:22.960 --> 05:21:24.960
[Guest 2]: and the other ball.

05:21:24.960 --> 05:21:26.960
[Guest 2]: I said, explain.

05:21:26.960 --> 05:21:28.960
[Guest 2]: He said, what happens is

05:21:28.960 --> 05:21:30.960
[Guest 2]: when I play the ball

05:21:30.960 --> 05:21:32.960
[Guest 2]: suppose I hit it on the cover point

05:21:32.960 --> 05:21:34.960
[Guest 2]: so I am thinking if the next ball comes like this

05:21:34.960 --> 05:21:36.960
[Guest 2]: Gillespie did this, he did that

05:21:36.960 --> 05:21:38.960
[Guest 2]: and I am seeing that as my

05:21:38.960 --> 05:21:40.960
[Guest 2]: thought is swinging

05:21:40.960 --> 05:21:42.960
[Guest 2]: I go

05:21:42.960 --> 05:21:44.960
[Guest 2]: and the next ball comes like this.

05:21:44.960 --> 05:21:46.960
[Guest 2]: So I asked Dravid

05:21:46.960 --> 05:21:48.960
[Guest 2]: and he said that I do deep breathing

05:21:48.960 --> 05:21:50.960
[Guest 2]: in the square leg position.

05:21:50.960 --> 05:21:52.960
[Guest 2]: So I told Dravid that

05:21:52.960 --> 05:21:54.960
[Guest 2]: I don't know how to do meditation

05:21:54.960 --> 05:21:56.960
[Unknown]: but whenever I do it, I feel sleepy.

05:21:56.960 --> 05:21:58.960
[Unknown]: So he said

05:21:58.960 --> 05:22:00.960
[Guest 2]: I found out

05:22:00.960 --> 05:22:02.960
[Guest 2]: that in one ball

05:22:02.960 --> 05:22:04.960
[Guest 2]: and the other ball

05:22:04.960 --> 05:22:06.960
[Guest 2]: I have to hit Kishore Kumar.

05:22:06.960 --> 05:22:08.960
[Guest 2]: And he said the moment I played the ball

05:22:08.960 --> 05:22:10.960
[Guest 2]: and I came this way

05:22:10.960 --> 05:22:12.960
[Guest 2]: I kept on playing

05:22:12.960 --> 05:22:14.960
[Guest 2]: till the bowler's mark

05:22:14.960 --> 05:22:16.960
[Guest 2]: I would say and many times

05:22:16.960 --> 05:22:18.960
[Guest 2]: I have told Ishaan Sharma

05:22:18.960 --> 05:22:20.960
[Guest 2]: that I have forgotten the lyrics

05:22:20.960 --> 05:22:22.960
[Guest 2]: of 12th man.

05:22:22.960 --> 05:22:24.960
[Guest 2]: He said this is the work of 12th man

05:22:24.960 --> 05:22:26.960
[Guest 2]: in Indian cricket.

05:22:26.960 --> 05:22:28.960
[Guest 1]: And then he said

05:22:28.960 --> 05:22:30.960
[Guest 1]: It's happened

05:22:30.960 --> 05:22:32.960
[Guest 1]: in a match in South Africa

05:22:32.960 --> 05:22:34.960
[Guest 2]: he said I forgot the lyrics

05:22:34.960 --> 05:22:36.960
[Guest 2]: of this song

05:22:36.960 --> 05:22:38.960
[Guest 2]: and Ishaan Sharma

05:22:38.960 --> 05:22:40.960
[Guest 2]: brought it from this

05:22:40.960 --> 05:22:42.960
[Guest 2]: and he went on to score some 100 runs

05:22:42.960 --> 05:22:44.960
[Guest 2]: or something like that. So I thought

05:22:44.960 --> 05:22:46.960
[Guest 2]: these were very deep philosophies

05:22:46.960 --> 05:22:48.960
[Guest 2]: of being in the moment

05:22:48.960 --> 05:22:50.960
[Guest 2]: and if you want

05:22:50.960 --> 05:22:52.960
[Guest 2]: anybody to, like I told my nephew

05:22:52.960 --> 05:22:54.960
[Guest 2]: the other day who has a little bit of attention issue

05:22:54.960 --> 05:22:56.960
[Guest 2]: like me and said that now that you are

05:22:56.960 --> 05:22:58.960
[Guest 2]: doing this, can you just for the next

05:22:58.960 --> 05:23:00.960
[Guest 2]: 15 minutes do this without getting distracted.

05:23:00.960 --> 05:23:02.960
[Guest 2]: And now in this mobile generation

05:23:02.960 --> 05:23:04.960
[Guest 2]: it's getting tougher and tougher.

05:23:04.960 --> 05:23:06.960
[Guest 2]: So many young players today

05:23:06.960 --> 05:23:08.960
[Guest 2]: Rahul would probably spend more time

05:23:08.960 --> 05:23:10.960
[Guest 2]: in telling them to be in the moment

05:23:10.960 --> 05:23:12.960
[Guest 2]: because rest of the cricketing skills as Rawit says

05:23:12.960 --> 05:23:14.960
[Guest 2]: these boys are far better than what we were

05:23:14.960 --> 05:23:16.960
[Guest 2]: during the 80s and the 90s

05:23:16.960 --> 05:23:18.960
[Guest 2]: because they have far more

05:23:18.960 --> 05:23:20.960
[Guest 2]: strokes than I can ever imagine

05:23:20.960 --> 05:23:22.960
[Guest 2]: in my life. So yeah, so

05:23:22.960 --> 05:23:24.960
[Guest 2]: through cricket there were some great life

05:23:24.960 --> 05:23:26.960
[Guest 2]: lessons that one got exposed to

05:23:26.960 --> 05:23:28.960
[Guest 2]: basic things that everybody in life

05:23:28.960 --> 05:23:30.960
[Guest 2]: should be doing and from

05:23:30.960 --> 05:23:32.960
[Guest 2]: sheer, as I said

05:23:32.960 --> 05:23:34.960
[Guest 2]: we all share this thing of

05:23:34.960 --> 05:23:36.960
[Guest 1]: understanding people's lives and

05:23:36.960 --> 05:23:38.960
[Guest 2]: No no really, I think

05:23:38.960 --> 05:23:40.960
[Guest 2]: And pressure makes

05:23:40.960 --> 05:23:42.960
[Guest 2]: others life more interesting.

05:23:42.960 --> 05:23:44.960
[Guest 1]: You know so in fact

05:23:44.960 --> 05:23:46.960
[Guest 1]: you know when I started

05:23:46.960 --> 05:23:48.960
[Guest 1]: Commune and before that

05:23:48.960 --> 05:23:50.960
[Guest 1]: every time, I mean before that I think most of my

05:23:50.960 --> 05:23:52.960
[Guest 1]: things that I was doing

05:23:52.960 --> 05:23:54.960
[Guest 1]: and when you started with this thing of saying that you know

05:23:54.960 --> 05:23:56.960
[Guest 1]: this self-belief and wanting

05:23:56.960 --> 05:23:58.960
[Guest 1]: to do everything for yourself

05:23:58.960 --> 05:24:00.960
[Guest 1]: I initially was just

05:24:00.960 --> 05:24:02.960
[Guest 1]: doing things because you know I had

05:24:02.960 --> 05:24:04.960
[Guest 1]: these little caveats,

05:24:04.960 --> 05:24:06.960
[Guest 1]: I have to earn this much money, I have to do this, I have to do that

05:24:06.960 --> 05:24:08.960
[Guest 1]: whatever and then came that

05:24:08.960 --> 05:24:10.960
[Guest 1]: little period of time when I was doing stuff

05:24:10.960 --> 05:24:12.960
[Guest 1]: because it was all very safe. Similarly

05:24:12.960 --> 05:24:14.960
[Guest 1]: before television shows they were all safe

05:24:14.960 --> 05:24:16.960
[Guest 1]: I wasn't acting because that I was unsafe

05:24:16.960 --> 05:24:18.960
[Guest 1]: then when I got into the film I said

05:24:18.960 --> 05:24:20.960
[Guest 1]: yaar ab bas ban gaya and you know the problem was

05:24:20.960 --> 05:24:22.960
[Guest 1]: and I mean Sartin was very close to me because he was with me

05:24:22.960 --> 05:24:24.960
[Guest 1]: in that journey with a whole bunch of our friends

05:24:24.960 --> 05:24:26.960
[Guest 1]: and at that point in time I started

05:24:26.960 --> 05:24:28.960
[Guest 1]: imagining the outcome

05:24:28.960 --> 05:24:30.960
[Guest 1]: more than concentrating

05:24:30.960 --> 05:24:32.960
[Guest 1]: on what I was doing. Like I swear

05:24:32.960 --> 05:24:34.960
[Guest 1]: I swear the stupidest thing was to think

05:24:34.960 --> 05:24:36.960
[Guest 1]: ke main toh Indian Idol ka judge bhi ban jaoga

05:24:36.960 --> 05:24:38.960
[Guest 1]: you know ke bhai itni badi film banane ke baad

05:24:38.960 --> 05:24:40.960
[Guest 1]: Red Chillies ki

05:24:40.960 --> 05:24:42.960
[Guest 1]: I'll be an Indian Idol judge

05:24:42.960 --> 05:24:44.960
[Guest 1]: and you get seduced by all the stupid

05:24:44.960 --> 05:24:46.960
[Guest 1]: things in the world you know

05:24:46.960 --> 05:24:48.960
[Guest 1]: the role to hell is played with good

05:24:48.960 --> 05:24:50.960
[Guest 1]: intention kind of stuff and

05:24:50.960 --> 05:24:52.960
[Guest 1]: there is this classic problem

05:24:52.960 --> 05:24:54.960
[Guest 1]: if you are a democratic decision

05:24:54.960 --> 05:24:56.960
[Guest 1]: maker which I normally am, I like to take everyone's

05:24:56.960 --> 05:24:58.960
[Guest 1]: opinion. On a film set and

05:24:58.960 --> 05:25:00.960
[Guest 1]: Quentin Tarantino said this, he says you know

05:25:00.960 --> 05:25:02.960
[Guest 1]: I am the Pope

05:25:02.960 --> 05:25:04.960
[Guest 1]: at the altar that you worship

05:25:04.960 --> 05:25:06.960
[Guest 1]: so in this moment

05:25:06.960 --> 05:25:08.960
[Guest 1]: main hoon Bhagwan

05:25:08.960 --> 05:25:10.960
[Guest 1]: main jo bol raha hoi hoga

05:25:10.960 --> 05:25:12.960
[Guest 1]: chahe mujhe khud nahi pata. Imtiaz has told

05:25:12.960 --> 05:25:14.960
[Guest 1]: me the same thing at times, saying that I am on the set

05:25:14.960 --> 05:25:16.960
[Guest 1]: and suddenly somebody will ask me saying ki

05:25:16.960 --> 05:25:18.960
[Guest 1]: sir my cinematography, I didn't know nothing about cinematography

05:25:18.960 --> 05:25:20.960
[Guest 1]: so often I would have

05:25:20.960 --> 05:25:22.960
[Guest 1]: a shot being done and in the middle of the shot

05:25:22.960 --> 05:25:24.960
[Guest 1]: my cinematographer would come and say Imtiaz I am thinking of

05:25:24.960 --> 05:25:26.960
[Guest 1]: doing a mid shot moving from here to here, what do you think?

05:25:26.960 --> 05:25:28.960
[Guest 1]: So I used to listen to him

05:25:28.960 --> 05:25:30.960
[Guest 1]: pause for a bit and turn and say ha sir

05:25:30.960 --> 05:25:32.960
[Guest 1]: maybe you could start a little longer

05:25:32.960 --> 05:25:34.960
[Guest 1]: because I didn't

05:25:34.960 --> 05:25:36.960
[Guest 1]: know what to tell him. Toh main karte rehte

05:25:36.960 --> 05:25:38.960
[Guest 1]: the but I couldn't show people that I don't know

05:25:38.960 --> 05:25:40.960
[Guest 1]: I would very often naively

05:25:40.960 --> 05:25:42.960
[Guest 1]: acknowledge the fact ki yaar achha tum kaise karoge

05:25:42.960 --> 05:25:44.960
[Guest 1]: and I realized that on a film set

05:25:44.960 --> 05:25:46.960
[Guest 1]: na everybody wants to make their own film

05:25:46.960 --> 05:25:48.960
[Guest 1]: and they are dying to and they

05:25:48.960 --> 05:25:50.960
[Guest 1]: will never get that opportunity

05:25:50.960 --> 05:25:52.960
[Guest 1]: so you open up that opportunity once

05:25:52.960 --> 05:25:54.960
[Guest 1]: and everyone from the

05:25:54.960 --> 05:25:56.960
[Guest 1]: gaffer to the AD to the actor

05:25:56.960 --> 05:25:58.960
[Guest 1]: to the makeup person will tell you his version

05:25:58.960 --> 05:26:00.960
[Guest 1]: of your film and that is

05:26:00.960 --> 05:26:02.960
[Guest 1]: so hyper confusing unless you are decisive

05:26:02.960 --> 05:26:04.960
[Guest 1]: so you can hear and make your decision so now shut up

05:26:04.960 --> 05:26:06.960
[Guest 1]: main kar raha hoon, yeh ek

05:26:06.960 --> 05:26:08.960
[Guest 1]: problem type tha and

05:26:08.960 --> 05:26:10.960
[Guest 1]: dhai saal, teen saal film pe

05:26:10.960 --> 05:26:12.960
[Guest 1]: kaam karne ke baad na main nichud chuka

05:26:12.960 --> 05:26:14.960
[Guest 1]: tha, mere andar se sab nikal gaya tha, koi kahani

05:26:14.960 --> 05:26:16.960
[Guest 1]: nahi bachi thi, nothing was left

05:26:16.960 --> 05:26:18.960
[Guest 1]: so when Commune started

05:26:18.960 --> 05:26:20.960
[Guest 1]: and Sathe knows this, I said

05:26:20.960 --> 05:26:22.960
[Guest 1]: every time a session happens

05:26:22.960 --> 05:26:24.960
[Guest 1]: I am richer because main das

05:26:24.960 --> 05:26:26.960
[Guest 1]: kahania sunta, main das

05:26:26.960 --> 05:26:28.960
[Guest 1]: logon ki vision se sunta

05:26:28.960 --> 05:26:30.960
[Guest 1]: and because I hear them

05:26:30.960 --> 05:26:32.960
[Guest 1]: and I don't see them

05:26:32.960 --> 05:26:34.960
[Guest 1]: I visualize them as a film

05:26:34.960 --> 05:26:36.960
[Guest 1]: so every time I would say

05:26:36.960 --> 05:26:38.960
[Guest 1]: yeh aisa hota toh, aisa ho jata hai

05:26:38.960 --> 05:26:40.960
[Guest 1]: now this has been happening from 2015

05:26:40.960 --> 05:26:42.960
[Guest 1]: onwards roughly, 17 actively

05:26:42.960 --> 05:26:44.960
[Guest 1]: and I am now

05:26:44.960 --> 05:26:46.960
[Guest 1]: absolutely, I am now set again

05:26:46.960 --> 05:26:48.960
[Guest 1]: I have written a book which is going to be

05:26:48.960 --> 05:26:50.960
[Guest 1]: a film, writing two OTT shows

05:26:50.960 --> 05:26:52.960
[Guest 1]: but it's all because I have been

05:26:52.960 --> 05:26:54.960
[Guest 1]: so enriched by these stories

05:26:54.960 --> 05:26:56.960
[Guest 1]: that I have listened, so as you said

05:26:56.960 --> 05:26:58.960
[Guest 1]: being a great listener

05:26:58.960 --> 05:27:00.960
[Guest 1]: is a 101% something that

05:27:00.960 --> 05:27:02.960
[Guest 1]: I have actually re-picked

05:27:02.960 --> 05:27:04.960
[Guest 1]: but I feel I picked it till I was 23-24

05:27:04.960 --> 05:27:06.960
[Guest 1]: then I implemented it for a good 15 years

05:27:06.960 --> 05:27:08.960
[Guest 1]: sab nichlo gaya, ab phir bharna

05:27:08.960 --> 05:27:10.960
[Guest 1]: shuru kara tha, did all that

05:27:10.960 --> 05:27:12.960
[Guest 1]: this being present

05:27:12.960 --> 05:27:14.960
[Guest 1]: is something that I, again recently

05:27:14.960 --> 05:27:16.960
[Guest 1]: in the play I realized because

05:27:16.960 --> 05:27:18.960
[Guest 1]: I was there, an MC

05:27:18.960 --> 05:27:20.960
[Guest 1]: acting as an actor

05:27:20.960 --> 05:27:22.960
[Guest 1]: play acting as an actor, till I

05:27:22.960 --> 05:27:24.960
[Guest 1]: realized in the first 20 days ki mere charo

05:27:24.960 --> 05:27:26.960
[Guest 1]: taraf sab actor thi, unka profession sirf

05:27:26.960 --> 05:27:28.960
[Guest 1]: acting tha, there were one or two

05:27:28.960 --> 05:27:30.960
[Guest 1]: of them who were, like Namit is a great

05:27:30.960 --> 05:27:32.960
[Guest 1]: singer and an actor

05:27:32.960 --> 05:27:34.960
[Guest 1]: and he used to have a band and everything else

05:27:34.960 --> 05:27:36.960
[Guest 1]: but everybody else was just an actor

05:27:36.960 --> 05:27:38.960
[Guest 1]: and so their craft was at another

05:27:38.960 --> 05:27:40.960
[Guest 1]: level, so the first thing

05:27:40.960 --> 05:27:42.960
[Guest 1]: was that on the 10th day or something

05:27:42.960 --> 05:27:44.960
[Guest 1]: I actually went up to Sagar and I said Sagar

05:27:44.960 --> 05:27:46.960
[Guest 1]: will you do my lines with me, and he was like

05:27:46.960 --> 05:27:48.960
[Guest 1]: kya baat kar rahe hain aap, and I said nahi nahi bhai

05:27:48.960 --> 05:27:50.960
[Guest 1]: yeh main aapko guru maan ke keh rahe hain

05:27:50.960 --> 05:27:52.960
[Guest 1]: and he was like arre Roshan bhai aap aisa baat kar rahe hain

05:27:52.960 --> 05:27:54.960
[Guest 1]: and I was like nahi, I am not joking

05:27:54.960 --> 05:27:56.960
[Guest 1]: I am not trying to chadhao you, I am being

05:27:56.960 --> 05:27:58.960
[Guest 1]: honest in telling you, this is your craft

05:27:58.960 --> 05:28:00.960
[Guest 1]: I am a learner, teach me

05:28:00.960 --> 05:28:02.960
[Guest 1]: and I said you do it, you do it, you do it and I would keep

05:28:02.960 --> 05:28:04.960
[Guest 1]: observing him and seeing this

05:28:04.960 --> 05:28:06.960
[Guest 1]: or like Sharwari was in every scene and I found her to be so

05:28:06.960 --> 05:28:08.960
[Guest 1]: and I went to her and said to me how are you

05:28:08.960 --> 05:28:10.960
[Guest 1]: so present, and then she

05:28:10.960 --> 05:28:12.960
[Guest 1]: told me this thing about saying that you know how she

05:28:12.960 --> 05:28:14.960
[Guest 1]: she uses breath

05:28:14.960 --> 05:28:16.960
[Guest 1]: and said it's not just my breath, it's your breath

05:28:16.960 --> 05:28:18.960
[Guest 1]: because we are in

05:28:18.960 --> 05:28:20.960
[Guest 1]: the air, hum dono

05:28:20.960 --> 05:28:22.960
[Guest 1]: ek hi set of

05:28:22.960 --> 05:28:24.960
[Guest 1]: hum ek hi

05:28:24.960 --> 05:28:26.960
[Guest 1]: envelope of air me se aap saas le raha hain

05:28:26.960 --> 05:28:28.960
[Guest 1]: toh agar aap zyada lenge toh mai kam lungi

05:28:28.960 --> 05:28:30.960
[Guest 1]: aur agar aap kam lenge toh, you know like it's this thing

05:28:30.960 --> 05:28:32.960
[Guest 1]: and to think of something so

05:28:32.960 --> 05:28:34.960
[Guest 1]: deeply, ek dikh khushi

05:28:34.960 --> 05:28:36.960
[Guest 1]: hoti hai to know ke kisi nein

05:28:36.960 --> 05:28:38.960
[Guest 1]: itna socha hai, phir aap usko implement

05:28:38.960 --> 05:28:40.960
[Guest 1]: karte hain, you know, there is a scene

05:28:40.960 --> 05:28:42.960
[Guest 1]: in which Lalit has just

05:28:42.960 --> 05:28:44.960
[Guest 1]: realized that the house is crumbling and he's got to

05:28:44.960 --> 05:28:46.960
[Guest 1]: make this big decision between

05:28:46.960 --> 05:28:48.960
[Guest 1]: you know, can he banish the magic

05:28:48.960 --> 05:28:50.960
[Guest 1]: child who is his cousin's

05:28:50.960 --> 05:28:52.960
[Guest 1]: daughter or does he manage to banish the brother

05:28:52.960 --> 05:28:54.960
[Guest 1]: what does he do and there was a

05:28:54.960 --> 05:28:56.960
[Guest 1]: moment and Meera kept coming to me and

05:28:56.960 --> 05:28:58.960
[Guest 1]: explaining because I was

05:28:58.960 --> 05:29:00.960
[Guest 1]: so I would perform the thing perfectly and

05:29:00.960 --> 05:29:02.960
[Guest 1]: then there was a point where I would suddenly have to say where's the

05:29:02.960 --> 05:29:04.960
[Guest 1]: scene is over and it switches

05:29:04.960 --> 05:29:06.960
[Guest 1]: the tone to where's the photographer

05:29:06.960 --> 05:29:08.960
[Guest 1]: and I would say it and she would keep saying no

05:29:08.960 --> 05:29:10.960
[Guest 1]: I'm like, I think

05:29:10.960 --> 05:29:12.960
[Guest 1]: I'm doing a great job, the scene is

05:29:12.960 --> 05:29:14.960
[Guest 1]: killer and she says see

05:29:14.960 --> 05:29:16.960
[Guest 1]: if you were present

05:29:16.960 --> 05:29:18.960
[Guest 1]: you cannot switch emotions so quickly

05:29:18.960 --> 05:29:20.960
[Guest 1]: you've just banished a man

05:29:20.960 --> 05:29:22.960
[Guest 1]: who meant everything in your life, in

05:29:22.960 --> 05:29:24.960
[Guest 1]: 3 seconds if you're saying where's the photographer

05:29:24.960 --> 05:29:26.960
[Guest 1]: you can't be all hunky dory

05:29:26.960 --> 05:29:28.960
[Guest 1]: your emotional residue would still

05:29:28.960 --> 05:29:30.960
[Guest 1]: be there and I couldn't feel it

05:29:30.960 --> 05:29:32.960
[Guest 1]: couldn't feel it, couldn't feel it, kept asking

05:29:32.960 --> 05:29:34.960
[Guest 1]: you know, I asked the other actor, asked the other actor

05:29:34.960 --> 05:29:36.960
[Guest 1]: and everybody said, tum kaise karte hai, tum kaise karte hai

05:29:36.960 --> 05:29:38.960
[Guest 1]: tum kaise karte hai, tum kaise karte hai

05:29:38.960 --> 05:29:40.960
[Guest 1]: ultimately you know, so I had to develop

05:29:40.960 --> 05:29:42.960
[Guest 1]: my own thing and I remembered this breath thing

05:29:42.960 --> 05:29:44.960
[Guest 1]: so from the point of the

05:29:44.960 --> 05:29:46.960
[Guest 1]: banishment which is about a minute and a half of a scene

05:29:46.960 --> 05:29:48.960
[Guest 1]: I start holding my breath

05:29:48.960 --> 05:29:50.960
[Guest 1]: you know, and

05:29:50.960 --> 05:29:52.960
[Guest 1]: my voice gets more constricted

05:29:52.960 --> 05:29:54.960
[Guest 1]: because saans kam hai, toh you know, wo barti jaari hai

05:29:54.960 --> 05:29:56.960
[Guest 1]: whatever, at this point

05:29:56.960 --> 05:29:58.960
[Guest 1]: I used to have to take such a deep

05:29:58.960 --> 05:30:00.960
[Guest 1]: saans

05:30:00.960 --> 05:30:02.960
[Guest 1]: that usse wo

05:30:02.960 --> 05:30:04.960
[Guest 1]: emotional change automatically

05:30:04.960 --> 05:30:06.960
[Guest 1]: aa jata tha and then

05:30:06.960 --> 05:30:08.960
[Guest 1]: when I said, where's that photographer

05:30:08.960 --> 05:30:10.960
[Guest 1]: you know, and I was still

05:30:10.960 --> 05:30:12.960
[Guest 1]: and the day I did it, she said

05:30:12.960 --> 05:30:14.960
[Guest 1]: yeah, you're there

05:30:14.960 --> 05:30:16.960
[Guest 1]: wo understanding jo hoti hai na

05:30:16.960 --> 05:30:18.960
[Guest 1]: by listening, by being present

05:30:18.960 --> 05:30:20.960
[Guest 1]: by rehearsing that craft and I just

05:30:20.960 --> 05:30:22.960
[Guest 1]: feel this, that you know, we're always

05:30:22.960 --> 05:30:24.960
[Guest 1]: a work in beta

05:30:24.960 --> 05:30:26.960
[Guest 1]: and

05:30:26.960 --> 05:30:28.960
[Guest 1]: you must believe that, you know

05:30:28.960 --> 05:30:30.960
[Guest 1]: your craft, you can only keep improving

05:30:30.960 --> 05:30:32.960
[Guest 1]: the amount I picked up

05:30:32.960 --> 05:30:34.960
[Guest 1]: you know, and I'm telling you, ever since I started

05:30:34.960 --> 05:30:36.960
[Guest 1]: listening to the podcast, then the classes

05:30:36.960 --> 05:30:38.960
[Guest 1]: then our conversations, and I'm a

05:30:38.960 --> 05:30:40.960
[Guest 1]: I'm a sponge, main wo kheechta raunga

05:30:40.960 --> 05:30:42.960
[Guest 1]: nichod uska kam nikalega, mujhe nahi pata hai

05:30:42.960 --> 05:30:44.960
[Guest 2]: ya saathi ho, hum log ki jab aatey hoti hai, hum log

05:30:44.960 --> 05:30:46.960

[Unknown]: business bala ke, usko bhej dala

05:30:50.960 --> 05:30:52.960
[Guest 1]: but that is where

05:30:52.960 --> 05:30:54.960
[Guest 1]: you know, natural, ek commune me sab

[Guest 1]: dhar aa gaya tha, Meera said

05:31:10.960 --> 05:31:12.960
[Guest 1]: something, so what happened was, a week before the

05:31:12.960 --> 05:31:14.960
[Guest 1]: play, suddenly we were given a message, which came saying

05:31:14.960 --> 05:31:16.960
[Guest 1]: that tomorrow morning guys, we have a script

05:31:16.960 --> 05:31:18.960

[Guest 1]: script padne hain, new script read kya hai

05:31:20.960 --> 05:31:22.960
[Guest 1]: so we were told that the culture ministry

[Guest 1]: in Doha, I mean there are some things and whatever

05:31:24.960 --> 05:31:26.960
[Guest 1]: cultural sensitivities, we will have to address

05:31:26.960 --> 05:31:28.960
[Guest 1]: and I am seeing this woman

05:31:28.960 --> 05:31:30.960
[Guest 1]: you know, bloody

05:31:30.960 --> 05:31:32.960
[Guest 1]: world renowned director, 65

05:31:32.960 --> 05:31:34.960
[Guest 1]: year old, handling the world on one side

05:31:34.960 --> 05:31:36.960
[Guest 1]: doing this play against all

05:31:36.960 --> 05:31:38.960
[Guest 1]: odds, our equipment hadn't reached Amit

05:31:38.960 --> 05:31:40.960
[Guest 1]: on time, we were delayed

05:31:40.960 --> 05:31:42.960
[Unknown]: but she is coming every morning with

05:31:42.960 --> 05:31:44.960
[Unknown]: this, good morning sunshines, how are you all

[Guest 1]: you know, and I would turn to her

05:31:48.960 --> 05:31:50.960
[Guest 1]: and I remember that morning when she had to do

05:31:50.960 --> 05:31:52.960
[Guest 1]: all of this, I turned to her and said, how are you doing

05:31:52.960 --> 05:31:54.960
[Guest 1]: not good, but I better act with all of you

05:31:54.960 --> 05:31:56.960
[Guest 1]: and she just told me in my ear

05:31:56.960 --> 05:31:58.960
[Guest 1]: hai yaar dekho yeh kya hai, toh jab wo

05:31:58.960 --> 05:32:00.960
[Guest 1]: show khatam wa, bahot acha show tha

05:32:00.960 --> 05:32:02.960
[Guest 1]: and she was just absolutely delighted

05:32:02.960 --> 05:32:04.960
[Guest 1]: and I went to her and she said, it's what I always say

05:32:04.960 --> 05:32:06.960
[Guest 1]: it's what I always say, heart of a poet

05:32:06.960 --> 05:32:08.960
[Guest 1]: skin of an elephant

05:32:08.960 --> 05:32:10.960
[Guest 1]: you know, and that line

05:32:10.960 --> 05:32:12.960
[Guest 1]: meri toh latest learning

05:32:12.960 --> 05:32:14.960
[Guest 1]: of har jagah hai, usko apne diwaag pe chalata hu

05:32:14.960 --> 05:32:16.960
[Guest 1]: main usme ek line add kar di hai, heart of a poet

05:32:16.960 --> 05:32:18.960
[Guest 1]: hide of an elephant, brain of a business

05:32:18.960 --> 05:32:20.960
[Unknown]: I think uska theek tha

05:32:20.960 --> 05:32:22.960
[Guest 1]: aapne business kyu add kya, mujhe pata nahi

05:32:22.960 --> 05:32:24.960
[Guest 1]: yeh dhan do

05:32:24.960 --> 05:32:26.960
[Guest 1]: dhan do

05:32:26.960 --> 05:32:28.960
[Guest 1]: but it was just that, I just felt that

05:32:28.960 --> 05:32:30.960
[Guest 1]: it was such a great

05:32:30.960 --> 05:32:32.960
[Guest 1]: thing to pick up and

05:32:32.960 --> 05:32:34.960
[Guest 1]: you know, to just constantly keep

05:32:34.960 --> 05:32:36.960
[Guest 1]: evolving along this line is the

05:32:36.960 --> 05:32:38.960
[Guest 1]: biggest lesson that I can possibly

05:32:38.960 --> 05:32:40.960
[Guest 1]: give to anyone

05:32:40.960 --> 05:32:42.960
[Guest 1]: to the younger generation, there's one lesson that

05:32:42.960 --> 05:32:44.960
[Guest 1]: I definitely want, and it's more of

05:32:44.960 --> 05:32:46.960
[Guest 1]: less a lesson, more a request, it is

05:32:46.960 --> 05:32:48.960
[Guest 1]: be gentle

05:32:48.960 --> 05:32:50.960
[Guest 1]: be gentle with your elders because

05:32:50.960 --> 05:32:52.960
[Guest 1]: they really are from a

05:32:52.960 --> 05:32:54.960
[Guest 1]: different time, matlab wo sajh batara hu

05:32:54.960 --> 05:32:56.960
[Guest 1]: jab main apne mamab ko handle karta hu kabhi kabar, there are some

05:32:56.960 --> 05:32:58.960
[Guest 1]: things, aise hi baat ho rahi thi one day

05:32:58.960 --> 05:33:00.960
[Guest 1]: and my mother, I could see that my mother was low about

05:33:00.960 --> 05:33:02.960
[Guest 1]: something and I said, shall we go and

05:33:02.960 --> 05:33:04.960
[Guest 1]: see a, and I couldn't even complete

05:33:04.960 --> 05:33:06.960
[Guest 1]: pagal nahi ho, I said mom

05:33:06.960 --> 05:33:08.960
[Guest 1]: I go and see a therapist

05:33:08.960 --> 05:33:10.960
[Guest 1]: you know, Shaheen and I have gone

05:33:10.960 --> 05:33:12.960
[Guest 1]: my children have gone when

05:33:12.960 --> 05:33:14.960
[Guest 1]: they needed counselling, but for them

05:33:14.960 --> 05:33:16.960
[Guest 1]: it means something else, unke ek stamp

05:33:16.960 --> 05:33:18.960
[Guest 1]: laga hua hai, and

05:33:18.960 --> 05:33:20.960
[Guest 1]: I'm like, I haven't been able to explain it to her

05:33:20.960 --> 05:33:22.960
[Guest 1]: and I was very frustrated

05:33:22.960 --> 05:33:24.960
[Guest 1]: very angry because I knew that if she did it

05:33:24.960 --> 05:33:26.960
[Guest 1]: would make her such a difference, but she won't

05:33:26.960 --> 05:33:28.960
[Guest 1]: because it's got this thing attached, and I just

05:33:28.960 --> 05:33:30.960
[Guest 1]: have to be gentle and say

05:33:30.960 --> 05:33:32.960
[Guest 1]: I can't change this, yeh main

05:33:32.960 --> 05:33:34.960
[Guest 1]: nahi badal paunga, you know

05:33:34.960 --> 05:33:36.960
[Guest 1]: toh theek hai, uske saath jeena seekhe

05:33:36.960 --> 05:33:38.960
[Guest 1]: my father, you know

05:33:38.960 --> 05:33:40.960
[Guest 1]: after he had his gallbladder thing

05:33:40.960 --> 05:33:42.960
[Guest 1]: before, he said beta, iske baad

05:33:42.960 --> 05:33:44.960
[Guest 1]: hospital kabhi nahi jaana, I'm like

05:33:44.960 --> 05:33:46.960
[Guest 1]: God forbid na jaana padhe, dekhan agar

05:33:46.960 --> 05:33:48.960
[Guest 1]: jaana padhega, toh main toh leke jaaunga

05:33:48.960 --> 05:33:50.960
[Guest 1]: aap jo kar lijiye, he was like

05:33:50.960 --> 05:33:52.960
[Guest 1]: no, you promise me that you will not do it, because I've done

05:33:52.960 --> 05:33:54.960
[Guest 1]: my share, I'm very happy, I've got everything

05:33:54.960 --> 05:33:56.960
[Guest 1]: again, you know like my mind is saying

05:33:56.960 --> 05:33:58.960
[Guest 1]: what the hell, what are the resources, there's everything, medicine

05:33:58.960 --> 05:34:00.960
[Guest 1]: blah blah blah, and sometimes

05:34:00.960 --> 05:34:02.960
[Guest 1]: when I deal with my children now

05:34:02.960 --> 05:34:04.960
[Guest 1]: I find it, I find that there

05:34:04.960 --> 05:34:06.960
[Guest 1]: are moments of

05:34:06.960 --> 05:34:08.960
[Guest 1]: deep resentment, there are moments of

05:34:08.960 --> 05:34:10.960
[Guest 1]: grave misunderstanding

05:34:10.960 --> 05:34:12.960
[Guest 1]: my daughter wrote a poem

05:34:12.960 --> 05:34:14.960
[Guest 1]: and I got so impacted, because

05:34:14.960 --> 05:34:16.960
[Guest 1]: you know, and I said, is this about us, and she

05:34:16.960 --> 05:34:18.960
[Guest 1]: says, yeah, but it's poetry

05:34:18.960 --> 05:34:20.960
[Guest 1]: and I'm exaggerating, and my

05:34:20.960 --> 05:34:22.960
[Guest 1]: fear was, I hope she, what if she's not exaggerating

05:34:22.960 --> 05:34:24.960
[Guest 1]: what if she really means every word of this

05:34:24.960 --> 05:34:26.960
[Guest 1]: have we scarred her in this

05:34:26.960 --> 05:34:28.960
[Guest 1]: manner, is it because of something she observed

05:34:28.960 --> 05:34:30.960
[Guest 1]: but you know, it's just

05:34:30.960 --> 05:34:32.960
[Guest 1]: that, and I just feel that people

05:34:32.960 --> 05:34:34.960
[Guest 1]: need to be a little gentle

05:34:34.960 --> 05:34:36.960
[Guest 1]: with each other, because

05:34:36.960 --> 05:34:38.960
[Guest 1]: everyone has their own set of battles

05:34:38.960 --> 05:34:40.960
[Guest 1]: everyone is coming from a different

05:34:40.960 --> 05:34:42.960
[Guest 1]: set of beliefs

05:34:42.960 --> 05:34:44.960
[Guest 1]: which have cast them a particular way

05:34:44.960 --> 05:34:46.960
[Guest 1]: we try very hard to change, but

05:34:46.960 --> 05:34:48.960
[Guest 1]: I think after a point

05:34:48.960 --> 05:34:50.960
[Guest 1]: it doesn't happen, genuinely our

05:34:50.960 --> 05:34:52.960
[Guest 1]: generation which looked both ways, once to

05:34:52.960 --> 05:34:54.960
[Guest 1]: the computers and once to

05:34:54.960 --> 05:34:56.960
[Guest 1]: the online, offline worlds, I believe

05:34:56.960 --> 05:34:58.960
[Guest 1]: that we're a lot more resilient

05:34:58.960 --> 05:35:00.960
[Guest 1]: personally, I'd like to believe that we're a lot more resilient

05:35:00.960 --> 05:35:02.960
[Guest 1]: but you know, the other two

05:35:02.960 --> 05:35:04.960
[Guest 1]: sides of the generation, they're very extreme

05:35:04.960 --> 05:35:06.960
[Guest 1]: so in their interaction, there should be a lot of

05:35:06.960 --> 05:35:08.960
[Guest 1]: gentleness, and

05:35:08.960 --> 05:35:10.960
[Amit Varma]: our generation should also be a little gentle

05:35:10.960 --> 05:35:12.960
[Amit Varma]: I think one person I'd like to bring up

05:35:12.960 --> 05:35:14.960
[Amit Varma]: in this context is a guy called Phineas Gage

05:35:14.960 --> 05:35:16.960
[Amit Varma]: have you heard of him? No, so Phineas

05:35:16.960 --> 05:35:18.960
[Amit Varma]: Gage was a railroad

05:35:18.960 --> 05:35:20.960
[Amit Varma]: worker in the 1840s

05:35:20.960 --> 05:35:22.960
[Amit Varma]: or 1850s or whatever

05:35:22.960 --> 05:35:24.960
[Amit Varma]: How would I know that?

05:35:24.960 --> 05:35:26.960
[Amit Varma]: Because you are interested in neuroscience

05:35:26.960 --> 05:35:28.960
[Unknown]: and this is a famous neuroscience case

05:35:28.960 --> 05:35:30.960
[Unknown]: Oh, I know this story!

05:35:30.960 --> 05:35:32.960
[Unknown]: So basically, he was a railroad

05:35:32.960 --> 05:35:34.960
[Amit Varma]: worker, so he was working with some

05:35:34.960 --> 05:35:36.960
[Amit Varma]: rods or whatever, so at one point

05:35:36.960 --> 05:35:38.960
[Amit Varma]: he was distracted by something

05:35:38.960 --> 05:35:40.960
[Amit Varma]: and there was a blast, and the rod went through his

05:35:40.960 --> 05:35:42.960
[Amit Varma]: like, it came out from the

05:35:42.960 --> 05:35:44.960
[Amit Varma]: head, it literally went through his brain

05:35:44.960 --> 05:35:46.960
[Amit Varma]: right, so you'd imagine him to be

05:35:46.960 --> 05:35:48.960
[Amit Varma]: dead on the spot, but he wasn't

05:35:48.960 --> 05:35:50.960
[Amit Varma]: and people came, they managed to take

05:35:50.960 --> 05:35:52.960
[Amit Varma]: the rod out, I think he was in the hospital for 2-3 weeks

05:35:52.960 --> 05:35:54.960
[Amit Varma]: and then he was released

05:35:54.960 --> 05:35:56.960
[Amit Varma]: now physically he got back to normal

05:35:56.960 --> 05:35:58.960
[Amit Varma]: but he lost a part of his frontal

05:35:58.960 --> 05:36:00.960
[Amit Varma]: cortex, now what happened

05:36:00.960 --> 05:36:02.960
[Amit Varma]: was that physically

05:36:02.960 --> 05:36:04.960
[Amit Varma]: he got back to normal, his memories

05:36:04.960 --> 05:36:06.960
[Amit Varma]: were identical, his intelligence was the

05:36:06.960 --> 05:36:08.960
[Amit Varma]: same, but his personality changed

05:36:08.960 --> 05:36:10.960
[Amit Varma]: from being a gentle

05:36:10.960 --> 05:36:12.960
[Amit Varma]: quiet person

05:36:12.960 --> 05:36:14.960
[Unknown]: like Roshan, he became

05:36:14.960 --> 05:36:16.960
[Amit Varma]: he became, and I can't

05:36:16.960 --> 05:36:18.960
[Amit Varma]: even think of a comparison in this

05:36:18.960 --> 05:36:20.960
[Amit Varma]: but he became a very violent, abusive

05:36:20.960 --> 05:36:22.960
[Amit Varma]: ugly person, where he would shout

05:36:22.960 --> 05:36:24.960
[Amit Varma]: at people and all of that, and lose his temper

05:36:24.960 --> 05:36:26.960
[Amit Varma]: all the time, he became a completely different person

05:36:26.960 --> 05:36:28.960
[Amit Varma]: one of his friends described him as

05:36:28.960 --> 05:36:30.960
[Amit Varma]: Nod Gage, you know, from Phineas Gage

05:36:30.960 --> 05:36:32.960
[Amit Varma]: to Nod Gage, and

05:36:32.960 --> 05:36:34.960
[Amit Varma]: that was, a neuroscientist

05:36:34.960 --> 05:36:36.960
[Amit Varma]: studied him, and you know, there are photographs

05:36:36.960 --> 05:36:38.960
[Amit Varma]: of his skull with the rod go through it

05:36:38.960 --> 05:36:40.960
[Amit Varma]: or maybe it's an image, whatever, but

05:36:40.960 --> 05:36:42.960
[Amit Varma]: the conclusion there was

05:36:42.960 --> 05:36:44.960
[Amit Varma]: that, and this is I think a profound truth

05:36:44.960 --> 05:36:46.960
[Amit Varma]: for all of us, that character is

05:36:46.960 --> 05:36:48.960
[Amit Varma]: more contingent than we think

05:36:48.960 --> 05:36:50.960
[Amit Varma]: right, that we think

05:36:50.960 --> 05:36:52.960
[Amit Varma]: I am who I am, you know, Roshan

05:36:52.960 --> 05:36:54.960
[Amit Varma]: is a very gentle person, a good man

05:36:54.960 --> 05:36:56.960
[Unknown]: put a rod through his head, then see what happens

05:36:56.960 --> 05:36:58.960
[Amit Varma]: right, so the point is

05:36:58.960 --> 05:37:00.960
[Amit Varma]: knowing him, he'll put a rod through his head

05:37:00.960 --> 05:37:02.960
[Amit Varma]: yeah, no, after we put a rod

05:37:02.960 --> 05:37:04.960
[Unknown]: through his head, he'll change and he'll put a rod through

05:37:04.960 --> 05:37:06.960
[Amit Varma]: our heads, no, but the point being

05:37:06.960 --> 05:37:08.960
[Amit Varma]: the point being, that

05:37:08.960 --> 05:37:10.960
[Amit Varma]: everything that we are

05:37:10.960 --> 05:37:12.960
[Amit Varma]: is so contingent, like I think back on one of my

05:37:12.960 --> 05:37:14.960
[Amit Varma]: favorite musicians, Chris Cornell

05:37:14.960 --> 05:37:16.960
[Amit Varma]: he took medication for something

05:37:16.960 --> 05:37:18.960
[Amit Varma]: and that medication, it was later found out

05:37:18.960 --> 05:37:20.960
[Unknown]: makes people suicidal, and he killed

05:37:20.960 --> 05:37:22.960
[Amit Varma]: himself, right, so otherwise

05:37:22.960 --> 05:37:24.960
[Amit Varma]: a person who is living life to the full

05:37:24.960 --> 05:37:26.960
[Amit Varma]: always in the moment, actually changing

05:37:26.960 --> 05:37:28.960
[Amit Varma]: completely, so, so much of what

05:37:28.960 --> 05:37:30.960
[Amit Varma]: we are is dependent on things

05:37:30.960 --> 05:37:32.960
[Amit Varma]: like the structure of the brain or the chemical

05:37:32.960 --> 05:37:34.960
[Amit Varma]: balance of that day, you know

05:37:34.960 --> 05:37:36.960
[Amit Varma]: if I miss my breakfast on a particular day

05:37:36.960 --> 05:37:38.960
[Amit Varma]: I might be a different person in the afternoon

05:37:38.960 --> 05:37:40.960
[Amit Varma]: just for a short span of time, you're reading

05:37:40.960 --> 05:37:42.960
[Amit Varma]: Behave by Robert Sapolsky, so that is so much

05:37:42.960 --> 05:37:44.960
[Amit Varma]: about how contingent all of this is

05:37:44.960 --> 05:37:46.960
[Amit Varma]: and I want to double down on the advice you gave

05:37:46.960 --> 05:37:48.960
[Amit Varma]: Roshan, for young people and for people everywhere

05:37:48.960 --> 05:37:50.960
[Amit Varma]: in general, and say that

05:37:50.960 --> 05:37:52.960
[Amit Varma]: please don't be judgmental of other

05:37:52.960 --> 05:37:54.960
[Amit Varma]: people, number one reason might be

05:37:54.960 --> 05:37:56.960
[Amit Varma]: that you are wrong, young people are often

05:37:56.960 --> 05:37:58.960
[Amit Varma]: wrong, later you change your mind, you understand

05:37:58.960 --> 05:38:00.960
[Amit Varma]: nuance, you understand the world differently

05:38:00.960 --> 05:38:02.960
[Amit Varma]: so you might be wrong, but even if you're right

05:38:02.960 --> 05:38:04.960
[Amit Varma]: even if you're convinced that you are right and somebody

05:38:04.960 --> 05:38:06.960
[Amit Varma]: else is wrong in their doings, do not

05:38:06.960 --> 05:38:08.960
[Amit Varma]: be judgmental because everything

05:38:08.960 --> 05:38:10.960
[Amit Varma]: that we are is contingent, we are all

05:38:10.960 --> 05:38:12.960
[Amit Varma]: going to die anyway, so be gentle

05:38:12.960 --> 05:38:14.960
[Amit Varma]: be compassionate, always be good

05:38:14.960 --> 05:38:16.960
[Amit Varma]: to everyone, and why am I sounding

05:38:16.960 --> 05:38:18.960
[Amit Varma]: more and more like a self-help guru

05:38:18.960 --> 05:38:20.960
[Amit Varma]: so let me come to another question with

05:38:20.960 --> 05:38:22.960
[Amit Varma]: this, which is that you know what you were

05:38:22.960 --> 05:38:24.960
[Amit Varma]: mentioning was very fascinating about

05:38:24.960 --> 05:38:26.960
[Unknown]: you know Martin and Evrotilova hearing the

05:38:26.960 --> 05:38:28.960
[Unknown]: plane, that's just such a mind

05:38:28.960 --> 05:38:30.960
[Amit Varma]: such a beautiful mind blowing story and I'm

05:38:30.960 --> 05:38:32.960
[Amit Varma]: reminded of, I wrote a

05:38:32.960 --> 05:38:34.960
[Amit Varma]: post 18 years ago, I think 2004

05:38:34.960 --> 05:38:36.960
[Amit Varma]: about why

05:38:36.960 --> 05:38:38.960
[Amit Varma]: athletes choke, I think I was basing

05:38:38.960 --> 05:38:40.960
[Amit Varma]: it on something Gladwell wrote

05:38:40.960 --> 05:38:42.960
[Amit Varma]: and it's exactly the same thing, that there is one

05:38:42.960 --> 05:38:44.960
[Amit Varma]: part of your decision making brain which is

05:38:44.960 --> 05:38:46.960
[Amit Varma]: just automating everything, so if I'm

05:38:46.960 --> 05:38:48.960
[Amit Varma]: driving on the street, where to turn

05:38:48.960 --> 05:38:50.960
[Amit Varma]: I'm not even thinking, actually it's really

05:38:50.960 --> 05:38:52.960
[Amit Varma]: complicated driving you know, there are the laws of

05:38:52.960 --> 05:38:54.960
[Amit Varma]: physics, different objects of different

05:38:54.960 --> 05:38:56.960
[Amit Varma]: masses moving from different angles at

05:38:56.960 --> 05:38:58.960
[Amit Varma]: different velocities, it's incredibly

05:38:58.960 --> 05:39:00.960
[Amit Varma]: complicated but the part of our brain

05:39:00.960 --> 05:39:02.960
[Amit Varma]: handles it, but the moment the other part of the

05:39:02.960 --> 05:39:04.960
[Amit Varma]: brain comes in where you begin to overthink it

05:39:04.960 --> 05:39:06.960
[Amit Varma]: you are screwed, like I

05:39:06.960 --> 05:39:08.960
[Amit Varma]: can type anything I want but if you ask me

05:39:08.960 --> 05:39:10.960
[Amit Varma]: where is Y on the keyboard, you know

05:39:10.960 --> 05:39:12.960
[Amit Varma]: without looking down, I can't tell you

05:39:12.960 --> 05:39:14.960
[Amit Varma]: even though I obviously know because I'm always

05:39:14.960 --> 05:39:16.960
[Amit Varma]: typing without looking at the keyboard or

05:39:16.960 --> 05:39:18.960
[Amit Varma]: if I say, how do you sign, show me

05:39:18.960 --> 05:39:20.960
[Amit Varma]: you know and you'll suddenly find

05:39:20.960 --> 05:39:22.960
[Amit Varma]: the other part of your brain has come in and you're having

05:39:22.960 --> 05:39:24.960
[Amit Varma]: trouble signing and you know

05:39:24.960 --> 05:39:26.960
[Amit Varma]: you no longer control your bank

05:39:26.960 --> 05:39:28.960
[Amit Varma]: account and everything's gone to hell

05:39:28.960 --> 05:39:30.960
[Amit Varma]: but you know, leaving that

05:39:30.960 --> 05:39:32.960
[Amit Varma]: aside, that

05:39:32.960 --> 05:39:34.960
[Amit Varma]: aspect of being in the moment, right

05:39:34.960 --> 05:39:36.960
[Amit Varma]: is super important

05:39:36.960 --> 05:39:38.960
[Amit Varma]: not just for a Martin and Avratilova

05:39:38.960 --> 05:39:40.960
[Amit Varma]: or for a Virender Sehwag

05:39:40.960 --> 05:39:42.960
[Amit Varma]: but it's important

05:39:42.960 --> 05:39:44.960
[Amit Varma]: for all of us and it's something that

05:39:44.960 --> 05:39:46.960
[Amit Varma]: I try to do but it's incredibly

05:39:46.960 --> 05:39:48.960
[Amit Varma]: hard because most of the time

05:39:48.960 --> 05:39:50.960
[Amit Varma]: you're just a little bit in the past or a little bit

05:39:50.960 --> 05:39:52.960
[Amit Varma]: in the future and earlier

05:39:52.960 --> 05:39:54.960
[Amit Varma]: you spoke about Roshan routinizing

05:39:54.960 --> 05:39:56.960
[Amit Varma]: everything and this is something I also

05:39:56.960 --> 05:39:58.960
[Amit Varma]: want to ask about, that boss

05:39:58.960 --> 05:40:00.960
[Amit Varma]: if I hadn't met you, I wouldn't have believed you're one person

05:40:00.960 --> 05:40:02.960
[Amit Varma]: I would have thought it's a collective of people

05:40:02.960 --> 05:40:04.960
[Amit Varma]: who call themselves Roshan Abbas and do all this

05:40:04.960 --> 05:40:06.960
[Amit Varma]: He's a pent-a-polar man

05:40:06.960 --> 05:40:08.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, after this recording, I'm going to

05:40:08.960 --> 05:40:10.960
[Amit Varma]: check if during this recording he's posted something

05:40:10.960 --> 05:40:12.960
[Unknown]: on Twitter because then I will

05:40:12.960 --> 05:40:14.960
[Unknown]: know that there's someone else

05:40:14.960 --> 05:40:16.960
[Amit Varma]: It's a team of people who call themselves Roshan Abbas

05:40:16.960 --> 05:40:18.960
[Amit Varma]: This guy is a front

05:40:20.960 --> 05:40:22.960
[Amit Varma]: So I want to understand

05:40:22.960 --> 05:40:24.960
[Amit Varma]: a little bit from both of you

05:40:24.960 --> 05:40:26.960
[Amit Varma]: In your case, it's your mastery of work

05:40:26.960 --> 05:40:28.960
[Amit Varma]: ethic and discipline and

05:40:28.960 --> 05:40:30.960
[Amit Varma]: staying in the moment, each of the times you do

05:40:30.960 --> 05:40:32.960
[Amit Varma]: this and in your case, it would be like

05:40:32.960 --> 05:40:34.960
[Amit Varma]: in my case, an attempt

05:40:34.960 --> 05:40:36.960
[Amit Varma]: to be sort of like that

05:40:36.960 --> 05:40:38.960
[Amit Varma]: So I'd like to hear of both your

05:40:38.960 --> 05:40:40.960
[Amit Varma]: sort of experiences with this aspect

05:40:40.960 --> 05:40:42.960
[Amit Varma]: and then we'll get back to the cricket and to Meera Nairji

05:40:42.960 --> 05:40:44.960
[Guest 1]: And we've forgotten the singing

05:40:44.960 --> 05:40:46.960
[Amit Varma]: That will come in the end

05:40:46.960 --> 05:40:48.960
[Guest 2]: Right now, it's night time

05:40:48.960 --> 05:40:50.960
[Guest 2]: Being in the moment, I've spoken about this

05:40:50.960 --> 05:40:52.960
[Guest 2]: so I'll sum it up my way

05:40:52.960 --> 05:40:54.960
[Guest 2]: and then you can take on because you're actually

05:40:54.960 --> 05:40:56.960
[Amit Varma]: practicing it. But I'm actually asking about you

05:40:56.960 --> 05:40:58.960
[Amit Varma]: like what have been your experiences

05:40:58.960 --> 05:41:00.960
[Amit Varma]: How do you find a work ethic

05:41:00.960 --> 05:41:02.960
[Amit Varma]: for yourself? Because I have the same problem

05:41:02.960 --> 05:41:04.960
[Amit Varma]: as you in terms of attention span

05:41:04.960 --> 05:41:06.960
[Amit Varma]: and mind always wandering and seeking

05:41:06.960 --> 05:41:08.960
[Guest 2]: dopamine through various

05:41:08.960 --> 05:41:10.960
[Guest 2]: Amit, you are at least

05:41:10.960 --> 05:41:12.960
[Guest 2]: a thousand times better than me. I have

05:41:12.960 --> 05:41:14.960
[Guest 2]: had this problem since I was a child

05:41:14.960 --> 05:41:16.960
[Guest 2]: where my ability to

05:41:16.960 --> 05:41:18.960
[Guest 2]: read more than 10 minutes is

05:41:18.960 --> 05:41:20.960
[Guest 2]: not there. And I've struggled

05:41:20.960 --> 05:41:22.960
[Guest 2]: but because I've been a lazy person, this I could

05:41:22.960 --> 05:41:24.960
[Guest 2]: have won over only by

05:41:24.960 --> 05:41:26.960
[Guest 2]: discipline and routinizing, which Roshan now

05:41:26.960 --> 05:41:28.960
[Guest 2]: it comes naturally to him. So

05:41:28.960 --> 05:41:30.960
[Guest 2]: if I would have practiced, maybe today

05:41:30.960 --> 05:41:32.960
[Guest 2]: I decide to go home and I do

05:41:32.960 --> 05:41:34.960
[Guest 2]: the routine like, you know, you look

05:41:34.960 --> 05:41:36.960
[Guest 2]: at any cricketers post-match

05:41:36.960 --> 05:41:38.960
[Guest 2]: interview, it's the two words routine

05:41:38.960 --> 05:41:40.960
[Guest 2]: and process because that's the only

05:41:40.960 --> 05:41:42.960
[Guest 2]: way to come to the moment. There is no other

05:41:42.960 --> 05:41:44.960
[Guest 2]: way, right? So if we

05:41:44.960 --> 05:41:46.960
[Guest 2]: for example, you and me have to come

05:41:46.960 --> 05:41:48.960
[Guest 2]: to a point, we will have to

05:41:48.960 --> 05:41:50.960
[Guest 2]: design our life from 6 am

05:41:50.960 --> 05:41:52.960
[Guest 2]: in the morning, do that for 100

05:41:52.960 --> 05:41:54.960
[Guest 2]: days to get that behavioral delta

05:41:54.960 --> 05:41:56.960
[Guest 2]: going and only then we will be able

05:41:56.960 --> 05:41:58.960
[Guest 2]: to get that, you know, as Gulzar

05:41:58.960 --> 05:42:00.960
[Guest 2]: says to one of my friends

05:42:00.960 --> 05:42:02.960
[Guest 2]: that irrespective of

05:42:02.960 --> 05:42:04.960
[Guest 2]: what I do in my life

05:42:04.960 --> 05:42:06.960
[Guest 2]: 8 to

05:42:06.960 --> 05:42:08.960
[Guest 2]: 12 I write.

05:42:08.960 --> 05:42:10.960
[Guest 2]: That's routine. So

05:42:10.960 --> 05:42:12.960
[Guest 2]: once you write for 4 hours every

05:42:12.960 --> 05:42:14.960
[Guest 2]: day, you might write the worst

05:42:14.960 --> 05:42:16.960
[Guest 2]: thing in the world, but on your 100th

05:42:16.960 --> 05:42:18.960
[Guest 2]: day, you'll realize that the quality

05:42:18.960 --> 05:42:20.960
[Guest 2]: is improving. But I don't reach that process.

05:42:20.960 --> 05:42:22.960
[Guest 2]: I don't do it for a day

05:42:22.960 --> 05:42:24.960
[Guest 2]: and then I don't do it again.

05:42:24.960 --> 05:42:26.960
[Guest 2]: That is purely work ethic

05:42:26.960 --> 05:42:28.960
[Guest 2]: and discipline. And the moment you do it,

05:42:28.960 --> 05:42:30.960
[Guest 2]: I have been told by people who are

05:42:30.960 --> 05:42:32.960
[Guest 2]: performing at the highest level that you

05:42:32.960 --> 05:42:34.960
[Guest 2]: will be surprised with the power of routine.

05:42:34.960 --> 05:42:36.960
[Guest 2]: And that's what Atomic Habits also

05:42:36.960 --> 05:42:38.960
[Guest 2]: talks about, right? It is just about

05:42:38.960 --> 05:42:40.960
[Guest 2]: doing that drill again and again, playing

05:42:40.960 --> 05:42:42.960
[Guest 2]: those 200 balls on a daily basis

05:42:42.960 --> 05:42:44.960
[Guest 2]: and then you are also surprised

05:42:44.960 --> 05:42:46.960
[Guest 2]: how you hit that. That's why if you see Virat

05:42:46.960 --> 05:42:48.960
[Guest 2]: Kohli after that Haris

05:42:48.960 --> 05:42:50.960
[Guest 2]: Rao shot, you see

05:42:50.960 --> 05:42:52.960
[Guest 2]: him react in that post-match interview

05:42:52.960 --> 05:42:54.960
[Guest 2]: and I do post-match, I listen to post-match

05:42:54.960 --> 05:42:56.960
[Guest 2]: interviews very clearly because it's a

05:42:56.960 --> 05:42:58.960
[Guest 2]: good representation of the state of mind

05:42:58.960 --> 05:43:00.960
[Guest 2]: of the player at that point of time.

05:43:00.960 --> 05:43:02.960
[Guest 2]: He says, I don't know how it happened,

05:43:02.960 --> 05:43:04.960
[Guest 2]: which means he's in the moment.

05:43:04.960 --> 05:43:06.960
[Guest 2]: The moment you are in the moment,

05:43:06.960 --> 05:43:08.960
[Guest 2]: that's what in sporting parlance

05:43:08.960 --> 05:43:10.960
[Guest 2]: is called a zone, where you actually

05:43:10.960 --> 05:43:12.960
[Guest 2]: are not able to think of anything

05:43:12.960 --> 05:43:14.960
[Guest 2]: and that is where your anxiety is the least.

05:43:14.960 --> 05:43:16.960
[Guest 2]: Why do people say that,

05:43:16.960 --> 05:43:18.960
[Guest 2]: boss, in the moment when you are there, then

05:43:18.960 --> 05:43:20.960
[Guest 2]: there is no anxiety and stress in your life

05:43:20.960 --> 05:43:22.960
[Guest 2]: because the past and present have been eliminated.

05:43:22.960 --> 05:43:24.960
[Guest 2]: So philosophically also,

05:43:24.960 --> 05:43:26.960
[Guest 2]: Patanjali 4000 years was trying to tell you

05:43:26.960 --> 05:43:28.960
[Guest 2]: the same thing, that if you

05:43:28.960 --> 05:43:30.960
[Guest 2]: stay on your breath, then you can't stay anywhere else.

05:43:30.960 --> 05:43:32.960
[Guest 2]: Humanly it's not possible

05:43:32.960 --> 05:43:34.960
[Guest 2]: that when I'm talking to you, I'm

05:43:34.960 --> 05:43:36.960
[Guest 2]: on Twitter. Roshan is different.

05:43:38.960 --> 05:43:40.960
[Guest 2]: But I'm saying generally for a person,

05:43:40.960 --> 05:43:42.960
[Guest 2]: one thing at a time,

05:43:42.960 --> 05:43:44.960
[Guest 2]: but you have to come to that work

05:43:44.960 --> 05:43:46.960
[Guest 2]: and look at that ball.

05:43:46.960 --> 05:43:48.960
[Guest 2]: Once Tendulkar told me that at

05:43:48.960 --> 05:43:50.960
[Guest 2]: 30th over, by the

05:43:50.960 --> 05:43:52.960
[Guest 2]: color of the ball, I could

05:43:52.960 --> 05:43:54.960
[Guest 2]: pick at what point Magra would reverse swing.

05:43:54.960 --> 05:43:56.960
[Guest 2]: And that I had done

05:43:56.960 --> 05:43:58.960
[Guest 2]: by observing how color of the ball changes.

05:43:58.960 --> 05:44:00.960
[Guest 2]: This is genius, right?

05:44:00.960 --> 05:44:02.960
[Guest 2]: I mean, how can you figure

05:44:02.960 --> 05:44:04.960
[Guest 2]: out color of the ball and the nature of the reverse swing?

05:44:04.960 --> 05:44:06.960
[Guest 2]: That comes because the guys see

05:44:06.960 --> 05:44:08.960
[Guest 2]: and there is a huge significance

05:44:08.960 --> 05:44:10.960
[Guest 2]: when the commentator says that he is seeing the ball

05:44:10.960 --> 05:44:12.960
[Guest 2]: like a football. We think that

05:44:12.960 --> 05:44:14.960
[Guest 2]: this is it. That big look

05:44:14.960 --> 05:44:16.960
[Guest 2]: means that he is in such a

05:44:16.960 --> 05:44:18.960
[Guest 2]: zone that his pupils are also dilating.

05:44:18.960 --> 05:44:20.960
[Guest 2]: And as they say

05:44:20.960 --> 05:44:22.960
[Guest 2]: when your adrenaline is high,

05:44:22.960 --> 05:44:24.960
[Guest 2]: when you come in a fighter flight,

05:44:24.960 --> 05:44:26.960
[Guest 2]: then your blood pressure

05:44:26.960 --> 05:44:28.960
[Guest 2]: improves and that's when your body

05:44:28.960 --> 05:44:30.960
[Guest 2]: is the best to react.

05:44:30.960 --> 05:44:32.960
[Guest 2]: That's why you are in that state of

05:44:32.960 --> 05:44:34.960
[Guest 2]: and I'll come to that last point of pressure, right?

05:44:34.960 --> 05:44:36.960
[Guest 2]: That the pressure

05:44:36.960 --> 05:44:38.960
[Guest 2]: handling is when the adrenaline

05:44:38.960 --> 05:44:40.960
[Guest 2]: output is the most optimum.

05:44:40.960 --> 05:44:42.960
[Guest 2]: When it is more,

05:44:42.960 --> 05:44:44.960
[Guest 2]: it means you are in over analysis.

05:44:44.960 --> 05:44:46.960
[Guest 2]: When it is less, it means you are not nervous.

05:44:46.960 --> 05:44:48.960
[Guest 2]: So at a stand-up comedian level,

05:44:48.960 --> 05:44:50.960
[Guest 2]: when I am a little nervous, that's when

05:44:50.960 --> 05:44:52.960
[Guest 2]: my best one-liners come.

05:44:52.960 --> 05:44:54.960
[Guest 2]: When I am complacent, my adrenaline is not there

05:44:54.960 --> 05:44:56.960
[Guest 2]: so I have just done this thing.

05:44:56.960 --> 05:44:58.960
[Guest 2]: When I am super nervous and I

05:44:58.960 --> 05:45:00.960
[Guest 2]: prepared so heavily, so the amount

05:45:00.960 --> 05:45:02.960
[Guest 2]: of preparation, which is process and

05:45:02.960 --> 05:45:04.960
[Guest 2]: routine also, it has to be calibrated.

05:45:04.960 --> 05:45:06.960
[Guest 2]: And that is why most sportsmen

05:45:06.960 --> 05:45:08.960
[Guest 2]: say that the best time I have performed

05:45:08.960 --> 05:45:10.960
[Guest 2]: is when I have rested well.

05:45:10.960 --> 05:45:12.960
[Guest 2]: So that combination of how

05:45:12.960 --> 05:45:14.960
[Guest 2]: much output to rest

05:45:14.960 --> 05:45:16.960
[Guest 2]: defines a good sportsperson.

05:45:16.960 --> 05:45:18.960
[Guest 2]: And my last point before the great

05:45:18.960 --> 05:45:20.960
[Guest 2]: Roshan Abbas tells his routine

05:45:20.960 --> 05:45:22.960
[Guest 2]: is the pressure point, right?

05:45:22.960 --> 05:45:24.960
[Guest 2]: That there are two perspectives

05:45:24.960 --> 05:45:26.960
[Guest 2]: of high-performance athletes to pressure.

05:45:26.960 --> 05:45:28.960
[Guest 2]: One is

05:45:28.960 --> 05:45:30.960
[Guest 2]: where they say, shit, tomorrow India-Pakistan

05:45:30.960 --> 05:45:32.960
[Guest 2]: is the game, boss.

05:45:32.960 --> 05:45:34.960
[Guest 2]: And that's nothing to do with your

05:45:34.960 --> 05:45:36.960
[Guest 2]: prowess. Whereas the

05:45:36.960 --> 05:45:38.960
[Guest 2]: other thing which you'll see Virat Kohli

05:45:38.960 --> 05:45:40.960
[Guest 2]: mentioning that I am waiting for an

05:45:40.960 --> 05:45:42.960
[Guest 2]: India-Pakistan game.

05:45:42.960 --> 05:45:44.960
[Guest 2]: Rahul Dravid would say in India

05:45:44.960 --> 05:45:46.960
[Guest 2]: when you met him after a test match,

05:45:46.960 --> 05:45:48.960
[Guest 2]: I am waiting for England to begin.

05:45:48.960 --> 05:45:50.960
[Guest 2]: Now these two perspectives

05:45:50.960 --> 05:45:52.960
[Guest 2]: define a champion.

05:45:52.960 --> 05:45:54.960
[Guest 2]: Because the moment you say

05:45:54.960 --> 05:45:56.960
[Guest 2]: I am looking for pressure,

05:45:56.960 --> 05:45:58.960
[Guest 2]: pressure does not affect you. The moment you

05:45:58.960 --> 05:46:00.960
[Guest 2]: want to run away from pressure is when

05:46:00.960 --> 05:46:02.960
[Guest 2]: you give a catch in the second, slip in the second

05:46:02.960 --> 05:46:04.960
[Guest 2]: over, knowing that this batsman could

05:46:04.960 --> 05:46:06.960
[Guest 2]: be actually better than this batsman.

05:46:06.960 --> 05:46:08.960
[Guest 2]: And that is why the greatest

05:46:08.960 --> 05:46:10.960
[Guest 2]: philosophy I have heard on pressure is

05:46:10.960 --> 05:46:12.960
[Guest 2]: Jimmy Connor's statement when he was

05:46:12.960 --> 05:46:14.960
[Guest 2]: asked, how do you deal with pressure?

05:46:14.960 --> 05:46:16.960
[Guest 2]: He said, I

05:46:16.960 --> 05:46:18.960
[Guest 2]: used to crumble under pressure.

05:46:18.960 --> 05:46:20.960
[Guest 2]: Then I made a perspective for myself

05:46:20.960 --> 05:46:22.960
[Guest 2]: and I said, when is the

05:46:22.960 --> 05:46:24.960
[Guest 2]: time when I became

05:46:24.960 --> 05:46:26.960
[Guest 2]: the richest? When is the time

05:46:26.960 --> 05:46:28.960
[Guest 2]: when I was the happiest ever?

05:46:28.960 --> 05:46:30.960
[Guest 2]: When is the time when I got the most attention?

05:46:30.960 --> 05:46:32.960
[Guest 2]: It was when I performed

05:46:32.960 --> 05:46:34.960
[Guest 2]: after a high-pressure game.

05:46:34.960 --> 05:46:36.960
[Guest 2]: Which means if I have to get rich,

05:46:36.960 --> 05:46:38.960
[Guest 2]: it means I have to be under pressure.

05:46:38.960 --> 05:46:40.960
[Guest 2]: So if there is no pressure, what a boring thing to play.

05:46:40.960 --> 05:46:42.960
[Guest 2]: So he calibrated

05:46:42.960 --> 05:46:44.960
[Guest 2]: his mind in such a way that pressure is

05:46:44.960 --> 05:46:46.960
[Guest 2]: where my incentive will be the highest.

05:46:46.960 --> 05:46:48.960
[Guest 2]: And I'll get the most return

05:46:48.960 --> 05:46:50.960
[Guest 2]: out of my profession. And he said

05:46:50.960 --> 05:46:52.960
[Guest 2]: that the only quest now was, after

05:46:52.960 --> 05:46:54.960
[Guest 2]: I had that perspective, was

05:46:54.960 --> 05:46:56.960
[Guest 2]: wait for a high-pressure game. And that

05:46:56.960 --> 05:46:58.960
[Guest 2]: is why my last submission

05:46:58.960 --> 05:47:00.960
[Guest 2]: is that you see the greatest

05:47:00.960 --> 05:47:02.960
[Guest 2]: players in the world, they don't

05:47:02.960 --> 05:47:04.960
[Guest 2]: perform in Ranji Trophy games.

05:47:04.960 --> 05:47:06.960
[Amit Varma]: There's a great quote by

05:47:06.960 --> 05:47:08.960
[Amit Varma]: Keith Miller, an Australian all-rounder.

05:47:08.960 --> 05:47:10.960
[Amit Varma]: He was in World War II.

05:47:10.960 --> 05:47:12.960
[Amit Varma]: He was a pilot in World War II

05:47:12.960 --> 05:47:14.960
[Amit Varma]: and there's a particular kind of German plane

05:47:14.960 --> 05:47:16.960
[Amit Varma]: called the Messerschmitt. So Michael

05:47:16.960 --> 05:47:18.960
[Amit Varma]: Parkinson once asked Keith Miller about pressure.

05:47:18.960 --> 05:47:20.960
[Amit Varma]: And Keith Miller said, you know what pressure is?

05:47:20.960 --> 05:47:22.960
[Amit Varma]: Pressure is a Messerschmitt up your arse.

05:47:24.960 --> 05:47:26.960
[Amit Varma]: And when he was asked about captaincy pressure,

05:47:26.960 --> 05:47:28.960
[Amit Varma]: he said, that's not all pressure.

05:47:28.960 --> 05:47:30.960
[Amit Varma]: And that puts the whole thing

05:47:30.960 --> 05:47:32.960
[Amit Varma]: into perspective, compared to that.

05:47:32.960 --> 05:47:34.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, sort of

05:47:34.960 --> 05:47:36.960
[Amit Varma]: what is pressure? And I came across this very interesting

05:47:36.960 --> 05:47:38.960
[Amit Varma]: distinction between

05:47:38.960 --> 05:47:40.960
[Amit Varma]: panic and choke, recently.

05:47:40.960 --> 05:47:42.960
[Amit Varma]: Where the distinction is that

05:47:42.960 --> 05:47:44.960
[Amit Varma]: choking is when you're overthinking it.

05:47:44.960 --> 05:47:46.960
[Amit Varma]: Right? And panic is when you're not

05:47:46.960 --> 05:47:48.960
[Amit Varma]: thinking enough.

05:47:48.960 --> 05:47:50.960
[Guest 2]: Which I found really fascinating.

05:47:50.960 --> 05:47:52.960
[Amit Varma]: So the answer is somewhere in between.

05:47:52.960 --> 05:47:54.960
[Amit Varma]: The answer is, like you said, that specific

05:47:54.960 --> 05:47:56.960
[Amit Varma]: point where everything is just

05:47:56.960 --> 05:47:58.960
[Amit Varma]: kind of in place and you probably only

05:47:58.960 --> 05:48:00.960
[Amit Varma]: get there if, like you said, if you're well rested,

05:48:00.960 --> 05:48:02.960
[Amit Varma]: you're fresh and, you know,

05:48:02.960 --> 05:48:04.960
[Amit Varma]: you just kind of do your Kishore Kumar

05:48:04.960 --> 05:48:06.960
[Amit Varma]: before the ball.

05:48:06.960 --> 05:48:08.960
[Guest 1]: No, I think,

05:48:08.960 --> 05:48:10.960
[Guest 1]: you know,

05:48:10.960 --> 05:48:12.960
[Guest 1]: I've actually currently been

05:48:12.960 --> 05:48:14.960
[Guest 1]: thinking a little deeply about

05:48:14.960 --> 05:48:16.960
[Guest 1]: one or two areas, which

05:48:16.960 --> 05:48:18.960
[Guest 1]: I actually wanted to ask and

05:48:18.960 --> 05:48:20.960
[Guest 2]: even... Did you forget your question?

05:48:20.960 --> 05:48:22.960
[Guest 1]: What? No, no, no.

05:48:22.960 --> 05:48:24.960
[Unknown]: Yes, yes, yes.

05:48:24.960 --> 05:48:26.960
[Unknown]: I'm saying that I'm sometimes

05:48:26.960 --> 05:48:28.960
[Unknown]: told... After routine

05:48:28.960 --> 05:48:30.960
[Guest 1]: that I'm so

05:48:30.960 --> 05:48:32.960
[Guest 1]: work oriented,

05:48:32.960 --> 05:48:34.960
[Guest 1]: I've made my life so much about

05:48:34.960 --> 05:48:36.960
[Guest 1]: karma that

05:48:36.960 --> 05:48:38.960
[Guest 1]: have I somewhere started

05:48:38.960 --> 05:48:40.960
[Guest 1]: losing out

05:48:40.960 --> 05:48:42.960
[Guest 1]: on the emotional

05:48:42.960 --> 05:48:44.960
[Guest 1]: aspect of life?

05:48:44.960 --> 05:48:46.960
[Guest 1]: I'm so work fulfilled that

05:48:46.960 --> 05:48:48.960
[Guest 1]: am I fulfilled by the relationships

05:48:48.960 --> 05:48:50.960
[Guest 1]: around me?

05:48:50.960 --> 05:48:52.960
[Guest 1]: Because my work relationships, my friends

05:48:52.960 --> 05:48:54.960
[Guest 1]: extend from my work relationships only.

05:48:54.960 --> 05:48:56.960
[Guest 1]: Frankly, all the work

05:48:56.960 --> 05:48:58.960
[Guest 1]: that I do is work that I enjoy. So I don't think it is

05:48:58.960 --> 05:49:00.960
[Guest 1]: work. It is really a great environment to

05:49:00.960 --> 05:49:02.960
[Guest 1]: be in. And so maybe

05:49:02.960 --> 05:49:04.960
[Guest 1]: the other

05:49:04.960 --> 05:49:06.960
[Guest 1]: thing that happens

05:49:06.960 --> 05:49:08.960
[Guest 1]: is that

05:49:08.960 --> 05:49:10.960
[Guest 1]: in that other quotient, am I

05:49:10.960 --> 05:49:12.960
[Guest 1]: either incapable

05:49:12.960 --> 05:49:14.960
[Guest 1]: or inadequate?

05:49:14.960 --> 05:49:16.960
[Guest 1]: And this is...

05:49:16.960 --> 05:49:18.960
[Guest 1]: So after Nikhil's episode, I actually called him and said,

05:49:18.960 --> 05:49:20.960
[Guest 1]: Nikhil, give me your therapist's number. So I said,

05:49:20.960 --> 05:49:22.960
[Guest 1]: I just want to discuss this because

05:49:22.960 --> 05:49:24.960
[Guest 1]: with no therapist have I ever been able to discuss

05:49:24.960 --> 05:49:26.960
[Guest 1]: this aspect that do some of us

05:49:26.960 --> 05:49:28.960
[Guest 1]: become so well adapted

05:49:28.960 --> 05:49:30.960
[Guest 1]: in that space that

05:49:30.960 --> 05:49:32.960
[Guest 1]: we are maladjusted elsewhere.

05:49:32.960 --> 05:49:34.960
[Guest 1]: And Satya has known me so long and he knows that

05:49:34.960 --> 05:49:36.960
[Guest 1]: I genuinely try my

05:49:36.960 --> 05:49:38.960
[Guest 1]: best to give time to family

05:49:38.960 --> 05:49:40.960
[Guest 1]: and friends and you know

05:49:40.960 --> 05:49:42.960
[Guest 1]: whatever. And I really do it.

05:49:42.960 --> 05:49:44.960
[Guest 1]: There was an app I found some last year

05:49:44.960 --> 05:49:46.960
[Guest 1]: called Garden. And Garden

05:49:46.960 --> 05:49:48.960
[Guest 1]: is an app actually which says almost how to nurture

05:49:48.960 --> 05:49:50.960
[Guest 1]: your relationship. So it says it allows you to divide

05:49:50.960 --> 05:49:52.960
[Guest 1]: people into

05:49:52.960 --> 05:49:54.960
[Guest 1]: family, friends and business.

05:49:54.960 --> 05:49:56.960
[Guest 1]: And then accordingly

05:49:56.960 --> 05:49:58.960
[Guest 1]: it allows you to set reminders when to

05:49:58.960 --> 05:50:00.960
[Guest 1]: connect with them. So automatically it will do

05:50:00.960 --> 05:50:02.960
[Guest 1]: family once a week, friends

05:50:02.960 --> 05:50:04.960
[Guest 1]: say you know once a fortnight,

05:50:04.960 --> 05:50:06.960
[Guest 1]: business maybe once a month and you can keep

05:50:06.960 --> 05:50:08.960
[Guest 1]: varying that. And I used it for

05:50:08.960 --> 05:50:10.960
[Guest 1]: 2-3 months and I realized that I do it automatically.

05:50:10.960 --> 05:50:12.960
[Guest 1]: I stay in touch with

05:50:12.960 --> 05:50:14.960
[Guest 1]: these three networks.

05:50:14.960 --> 05:50:16.960
[Guest 1]: I call my parents every morning.

05:50:16.960 --> 05:50:18.960
[Guest 1]: My son is in America. I normally

05:50:18.960 --> 05:50:20.960
[Guest 1]: wait for him to get in touch with me or whatever

05:50:20.960 --> 05:50:22.960
[Guest 1]: because I know he is in that phase where I was

05:50:22.960 --> 05:50:24.960
[Guest 1]: in college that I didn't want to be in touch with anyone.

05:50:24.960 --> 05:50:26.960
[Guest 1]: And I am okay with it. Shaheen

05:50:26.960 --> 05:50:28.960
[Guest 1]: is not. Aayital

05:50:28.960 --> 05:50:30.960
[Guest 1]: you know is 15.

05:50:30.960 --> 05:50:32.960
[Guest 1]: Whenever, whatever I

05:50:32.960 --> 05:50:34.960
[Guest 1]: can do, I do or whatever as I said

05:50:34.960 --> 05:50:36.960
[Guest 1]: there are lots of topics that I might end up discussing with her

05:50:36.960 --> 05:50:38.960
[Guest 1]: because we are trying to lead this two

05:50:38.960 --> 05:50:40.960
[Guest 1]: country life at the moment and I have just been

05:50:40.960 --> 05:50:42.960
[Guest 1]: taught this new thing about a three flag life

05:50:42.960 --> 05:50:44.960
[Guest 1]: which is can you chase the

05:50:44.960 --> 05:50:46.960
[Guest 1]: season of your choice across three countries

05:50:46.960 --> 05:50:48.960
[Guest 1]: which is the best life

05:50:48.960 --> 05:50:50.960
[Guest 1]: to lead. But then it is a nomadic

05:50:50.960 --> 05:50:52.960
[Guest 1]: life and I am okay with a nomadic

05:50:52.960 --> 05:50:54.960
[Guest 1]: life. I think somewhere we are still

05:50:54.960 --> 05:50:56.960
[Guest 1]: struggling with the fact that we are in two countries

05:50:56.960 --> 05:50:58.960
[Guest 1]: nowadays we are spending a lot

05:50:58.960 --> 05:51:00.960
[Guest 1]: of time where Shaheen is running her business there, I am here

05:51:00.960 --> 05:51:02.960
[Guest 1]: or whatever. And we have been

05:51:02.960 --> 05:51:04.960
[Guest 1]: a very very close family

05:51:04.960 --> 05:51:06.960
[Guest 1]: overall even otherwise.

05:51:06.960 --> 05:51:08.960
[Guest 1]: Now with age you are realizing

05:51:08.960 --> 05:51:10.960
[Guest 1]: that there is all of these aspects and sometimes

05:51:10.960 --> 05:51:12.960
[Guest 1]: I have been just trying to understand that is it

05:51:12.960 --> 05:51:14.960
[Guest 1]: a man thing?

05:51:14.960 --> 05:51:16.960
[Guest 1]: That we are more work

05:51:16.960 --> 05:51:18.960
[Guest 1]: oriented and are we emotionally

05:51:18.960 --> 05:51:20.960
[Guest 1]: a little dissonant? Are we always brought up

05:51:20.960 --> 05:51:22.960
[Guest 1]: not to show our emotions so

05:51:22.960 --> 05:51:24.960
[Guest 1]: often? For example I cry

05:51:24.960 --> 05:51:26.960
[Guest 1]: at a patriotic film but normally most other things

05:51:26.960 --> 05:51:28.960
[Guest 1]: do not make me cry at all.

05:51:28.960 --> 05:51:30.960
[Guest 1]: And again I am saying all this because

05:51:30.960 --> 05:51:32.960
[Guest 1]: otherwise my work routine

05:51:32.960 --> 05:51:34.960
[Guest 1]: and ethic is very clear.

05:51:34.960 --> 05:51:36.960
[Guest 1]: I wake up really early, I normally get up

05:51:36.960 --> 05:51:38.960
[Guest 1]: with my daughter in the morning so that I can see

05:51:38.960 --> 05:51:40.960
[Guest 1]: her for that one hour before she goes to school.

05:51:40.960 --> 05:51:42.960
[Guest 1]: She is very grumpy on certain

05:51:42.960 --> 05:51:44.960
[Guest 1]: days and I tell her listen I am waking up an hour

05:51:44.960 --> 05:51:46.960
[Guest 1]: before just to be with you.

05:51:46.960 --> 05:51:48.960
[Guest 1]: Please at least try to be happy. And then

05:51:48.960 --> 05:51:50.960
[Guest 1]: she says it's not you, it's me.

05:51:50.960 --> 05:51:52.960
[Guest 1]: And I was like I understand

05:51:52.960 --> 05:51:54.960
[Guest 1]: and she has found it. So there are days

05:51:54.960 --> 05:51:56.960
[Guest 1]: when she will give me that happy radiant smile and hug me

05:51:56.960 --> 05:51:58.960
[Guest 1]: and whatever. And there are days when she will sort of just

05:51:58.960 --> 05:52:00.960
[Guest 1]: slink out of the door as if somebody was

05:52:00.960 --> 05:52:02.960
[Guest 1]: the cat is dragging out. But it's

05:52:02.960 --> 05:52:04.960
[Guest 1]: that or whatever. I then

05:52:04.960 --> 05:52:06.960
[Guest 1]: because nobody else wakes up really early I get those

05:52:06.960 --> 05:52:08.960
[Guest 1]: two hours with myself. Which is

05:52:08.960 --> 05:52:10.960
[Guest 1]: when I am doing all my

05:52:10.960 --> 05:52:12.960
[Guest 1]: browsing, gallivanting,

05:52:12.960 --> 05:52:14.960
[Guest 1]: portals, going into trap doors,

05:52:14.960 --> 05:52:16.960
[Guest 1]: new worlds and I just do

05:52:16.960 --> 05:52:18.960
[Guest 1]: that. I don't

05:52:18.960 --> 05:52:20.960
[Guest 1]: note all

05:52:20.960 --> 05:52:22.960
[Guest 1]: of it down or whatever as it were.

05:52:22.960 --> 05:52:24.960
[Guest 1]: Right after that in the morning

05:52:24.960 --> 05:52:26.960
[Guest 1]: with breakfast and if I can I try to

05:52:26.960 --> 05:52:28.960
[Guest 1]: work out three times a week. Sometimes I will do five

05:52:28.960 --> 05:52:30.960
[Guest 1]: days. If I am in Dubai I will just go and cycle for 15

05:52:30.960 --> 05:52:32.960
[Guest 1]: kilometers while listening to you half

05:52:32.960 --> 05:52:34.960
[Guest 1]: the time at 1.5x

05:52:34.960 --> 05:52:36.960
[Guest 1]: which now I have managed to get to 1.5.

05:52:36.960 --> 05:52:38.960
[Guest 1]: And I know that my 15

05:52:38.960 --> 05:52:40.960
[Guest 1]: kilometers in mean that it will take me

05:52:40.960 --> 05:52:42.960
[Guest 1]: 45 minutes. And in those 45 minutes

05:52:42.960 --> 05:52:44.960
[Guest 1]: I have almost covered two hours

05:52:44.960 --> 05:52:46.960
[Guest 1]: of the podcast. So I have done half. Then I

05:52:46.960 --> 05:52:48.960
[Guest 1]: try and do it the next day and that's one routine

05:52:48.960 --> 05:52:50.960
[Guest 1]: that I follow. After that I have got these

05:52:50.960 --> 05:52:52.960
[Guest 1]: two calls that are normally scheduled. One with my

05:52:52.960 --> 05:52:54.960
[Guest 1]: internal team. So which is my left brain, right brain

05:52:54.960 --> 05:52:56.960
[Guest 1]: and I say I have to do this today. Very often

05:52:56.960 --> 05:52:58.960
[Guest 1]: I don't need to do that call because they now know it

05:52:58.960 --> 05:53:00.960
[Guest 1]: so well that they know and they will just tell me what to do.

05:53:00.960 --> 05:53:02.960
[Guest 1]: Then the rest of the

05:53:02.960 --> 05:53:04.960
[Guest 1]: day normally will end up being

05:53:04.960 --> 05:53:06.960
[Guest 1]: things that I have to engage with.

05:53:06.960 --> 05:53:08.960
[Guest 1]: So for three months when I was doing the play I had

05:53:08.960 --> 05:53:10.960
[Guest 1]: just changed that entire day. But I

05:53:10.960 --> 05:53:12.960
[Guest 1]: informed everybody saying guys I will be

05:53:12.960 --> 05:53:14.960
[Guest 1]: sporadically available in this time.

05:53:14.960 --> 05:53:16.960
[Guest 1]: And because the biggest commitment at that time was spoken

05:53:16.960 --> 05:53:18.960
[Guest 1]: I had also just given

05:53:18.960 --> 05:53:20.960
[Guest 1]: up on Encompass which was my event company and I

05:53:20.960 --> 05:53:22.960
[Guest 1]: exited it 100%. People were like oh my god

05:53:22.960 --> 05:53:24.960
[Guest 1]: but that was you and the umbilical cord

05:53:24.960 --> 05:53:26.960
[Guest 1]: and I said no. I had sold the

05:53:26.960 --> 05:53:28.960
[Guest 1]: company in 2008.

05:53:28.960 --> 05:53:30.960
[Guest 1]: You know

05:53:30.960 --> 05:53:32.960
[Guest 1]: I was

05:53:32.960 --> 05:53:34.960
[Guest 1]: taking care of it externally.

05:53:34.960 --> 05:53:36.960
[Guest 1]: I don't need to anymore. At some

05:53:36.960 --> 05:53:38.960
[Guest 1]: point we need to cut this umbilical cord

05:53:38.960 --> 05:53:40.960
[Guest 1]: and I did it and whatever

05:53:40.960 --> 05:53:42.960
[Guest 1]: and now the decision is WPPs are they

05:53:42.960 --> 05:53:44.960
[Guest 1]: continuing or not continuing their life or whatever.

05:53:44.960 --> 05:53:46.960
[Guest 1]: There's a bunch of people I

05:53:46.960 --> 05:53:48.960
[Guest 1]: mentor and I don't think

05:53:48.960 --> 05:53:50.960
[Guest 1]: I'm only mentoring them. There's a lot of times that I'm just

05:53:50.960 --> 05:53:52.960
[Guest 1]: listening to them and getting. So whether it's a Pooja

05:53:52.960 --> 05:53:54.960
[Guest 1]: who's a very dear friend

05:53:54.960 --> 05:53:56.960
[Guest 1]: and who was running Glitch or whatever

05:53:56.960 --> 05:53:58.960
[Guest 1]: Varun is there

05:53:58.960 --> 05:54:00.960
[Guest 1]: Nikhil I consider more. And

05:54:00.960 --> 05:54:02.960
[Guest 1]: again I will not say these are all mentees. These are all people

05:54:02.960 --> 05:54:04.960
[Guest 1]: I love to interact with because

05:54:04.960 --> 05:54:06.960
[Guest 1]: our work intersects and stuff

05:54:06.960 --> 05:54:08.960
[Guest 1]: and there's a host of these people

05:54:08.960 --> 05:54:10.960
[Guest 1]: you know. I spend time with

05:54:10.960 --> 05:54:12.960
[Guest 1]: all of them. Occasionally

05:54:12.960 --> 05:54:14.960
[Guest 1]: then I

05:54:14.960 --> 05:54:16.960
[Guest 1]: like to take a little snooze if I can in the afternoon

05:54:16.960 --> 05:54:18.960
[Guest 1]: doesn't happen more often than not but if I can

05:54:18.960 --> 05:54:20.960
[Guest 1]: take that half an hour siesta I think that thing

05:54:20.960 --> 05:54:22.960
[Guest 1]: beats it. I'm a tea addict.

05:54:22.960 --> 05:54:24.960
[Guest 1]: I have 4-5 cups of tea.

05:54:24.960 --> 05:54:26.960
[Guest 1]: I've had 4 with you.

05:54:26.960 --> 05:54:28.960
[Guest 1]: And

05:54:28.960 --> 05:54:30.960
[Guest 1]: that's how it continues and then

05:54:30.960 --> 05:54:32.960
[Guest 1]: I like to engage with a certain amount

05:54:32.960 --> 05:54:34.960
[Guest 1]: of you know that

05:54:34.960 --> 05:54:36.960
[Guest 1]: famous book The Artist's Way

05:54:36.960 --> 05:54:38.960
[Guest 1]: had two things. One which Sathe

05:54:38.960 --> 05:54:40.960
[Guest 1]: in fact said that do something and do it continuously

05:54:40.960 --> 05:54:42.960
[Guest 1]: so with her it was morning pages.

05:54:42.960 --> 05:54:44.960
[Guest 1]: I did morning pages after the

05:54:44.960 --> 05:54:46.960
[Guest 1]: film just to break that block and it did

05:54:46.960 --> 05:54:48.960
[Guest 1]: help me. I did morning pages after

05:54:48.960 --> 05:54:50.960
[Guest 1]: clear writing as well. And again that really

05:54:50.960 --> 05:54:52.960
[Guest 1]: helped me because that's how I got a lot of work done

05:54:52.960 --> 05:54:54.960
[Guest 1]: I think. But there's a beautiful thing in that which says

05:54:54.960 --> 05:54:56.960
[Guest 1]: you know date an art form

05:54:56.960 --> 05:54:58.960
[Guest 1]: and I try to do that. Like yesterday

05:54:58.960 --> 05:55:00.960
[Guest 1]: I really wanted to go to the Thespo festival

05:55:00.960 --> 05:55:02.960
[Guest 1]: that's happening at

05:55:02.960 --> 05:55:04.960
[Guest 1]: Prithvi because I wanted to see

05:55:04.960 --> 05:55:06.960
[Guest 1]: Sun Behen because it's a very good play.

05:55:06.960 --> 05:55:08.960
[Guest 1]: I couldn't see it but I will

05:55:08.960 --> 05:55:10.960
[Guest 1]: do something or whatever.

05:55:10.960 --> 05:55:12.960
[Guest 1]: So I think this is how I try

05:55:12.960 --> 05:55:14.960
[Guest 1]: and break up my

05:55:14.960 --> 05:55:16.960
[Guest 1]: normal routine is this.

05:55:16.960 --> 05:55:18.960
[Guest 1]: Earlier I would say yes

05:55:18.960 --> 05:55:20.960
[Guest 1]: to a lot of just random

05:55:20.960 --> 05:55:22.960
[Guest 1]: meetings. I have

05:55:22.960 --> 05:55:24.960
[Guest 1]: filtered that down so people

05:55:24.960 --> 05:55:26.960
[Guest 1]: I was so and I'm normally very very polite

05:55:26.960 --> 05:55:28.960
[Guest 1]: so I don't normally tell people say

05:55:28.960 --> 05:55:30.960
[Guest 1]: fuzz off. There's a

05:55:30.960 --> 05:55:32.960
[Guest 1]: simple way of knowing if I'm interested or not

05:55:32.960 --> 05:55:34.960
[Guest 1]: now which is that if I give you a reply which

05:55:34.960 --> 05:55:36.960
[Guest 1]: is a

05:55:36.960 --> 05:55:38.960
[Guest 1]: that means

05:55:38.960 --> 05:55:40.960
[Guest 1]: if I give you a reply I'll say

05:55:40.960 --> 05:55:42.960
[Guest 1]: which means

05:55:42.960 --> 05:55:44.960
[Guest 1]: if I give you a definite yes or no then I'm into it.

05:55:44.960 --> 05:55:46.960
[Guest 1]: My

05:55:46.960 --> 05:55:48.960
[Guest 1]: spheres of work and again

05:55:48.960 --> 05:55:50.960
[Guest 1]: I don't call it work because

05:55:50.960 --> 05:55:52.960
[Guest 1]: I want to make a film, I want to write a book,

05:55:52.960 --> 05:55:54.960
[Guest 1]: I want to grow the commune,

05:55:54.960 --> 05:55:56.960
[Guest 1]: I have started experiences in Dubai

05:55:56.960 --> 05:55:58.960
[Guest 1]: I have started a company, I will extend it to India

05:55:58.960 --> 05:56:00.960
[Guest 1]: because again I feel that there are really no

05:56:00.960 --> 05:56:02.960
[Guest 1]: quality experiences and the more I see them

05:56:02.960 --> 05:56:04.960
[Guest 1]: the more I realize the gap and I want to

05:56:04.960 --> 05:56:06.960
[Guest 1]: fill all of that and I think

05:56:06.960 --> 05:56:08.960
[Guest 1]: this is pretty much what we do.

05:56:08.960 --> 05:56:10.960
[Guest 1]: Shaheen makes sure that in the year

05:56:10.960 --> 05:56:12.960
[Guest 1]: we get enough breaks, we have enough time

05:56:12.960 --> 05:56:14.960
[Guest 1]: to connect with family and stuff and whatever.

05:56:14.960 --> 05:56:16.960
[Guest 1]: She is the love laughter

05:56:16.960 --> 05:56:18.960
[Guest 1]: fun department in many of

05:56:18.960 --> 05:56:20.960
[Guest 1]: these things and honestly I think she is a lot more

05:56:20.960 --> 05:56:22.960
[Guest 1]: emotionally grounded but

05:56:22.960 --> 05:56:24.960
[Guest 1]: this is an area which currently

05:56:24.960 --> 05:56:26.960
[Guest 1]: I'm trying to explore because I find this to be

05:56:26.960 --> 05:56:28.960
[Guest 1]: somewhere an area

05:56:28.960 --> 05:56:30.960
[Guest 1]: which either I'm under servicing or

05:56:30.960 --> 05:56:32.960
[Guest 1]: is it truly under serviced in people like

05:56:32.960 --> 05:56:34.960
[Guest 1]: yours is the

05:56:34.960 --> 05:56:36.960
[Guest 1]: thing that I don't have an answer for

05:56:36.960 --> 05:56:38.960
[Guest 1]: but otherwise

05:56:38.960 --> 05:56:40.960
[Guest 1]: this is the way I sort of exist

05:56:40.960 --> 05:56:42.960
[Guest 1]: I have a few

05:56:42.960 --> 05:56:44.960
[Guest 1]: goals

05:56:44.960 --> 05:56:46.960
[Guest 1]: that as I told you that when I discover

05:56:46.960 --> 05:56:48.960
[Guest 1]: like I mean see for example this whole

05:56:48.960 --> 05:56:50.960
[Guest 1]: a few money goal was a

05:56:50.960 --> 05:56:52.960
[Guest 1]: very clear 10 million dollars, I mean I was very

05:56:52.960 --> 05:56:54.960
[Guest 1]: clearly told it's a 10 million dollar goal or whatever

05:56:54.960 --> 05:56:56.960
[Guest 1]: etc. I think I achieved it.

05:56:56.960 --> 05:56:58.960
[Guest 1]: Yeah and it's fine

05:56:58.960 --> 05:57:00.960
[Guest 1]: it's not liquid.

05:57:00.960 --> 05:57:02.960
[Guest 1]: In an ideal FU

05:57:02.960 --> 05:57:04.960
[Guest 1]: you know money

05:57:04.960 --> 05:57:06.960
[Guest 1]: thing, it should be liquid.

05:57:06.960 --> 05:57:08.960
[Guest 1]: It's not that, I didn't make that much liquidity

05:57:08.960 --> 05:57:10.960
[Guest 1]: but I have made properties, houses

05:57:10.960 --> 05:57:12.960
[Guest 1]: nobody is you know

05:57:12.960 --> 05:57:14.960
[Guest 1]: there's no hand to mouth, you can make your

05:57:14.960 --> 05:57:16.960
[Guest 1]: choices or whatever you want to do.

05:57:16.960 --> 05:57:18.960
[Guest 1]: The F off which I recently

05:57:18.960 --> 05:57:20.960
[Guest 1]: discovered in Dubai because Dubai is now

05:57:20.960 --> 05:57:22.960
[Guest 1]: filled with billionaires

05:57:22.960 --> 05:57:24.960
[Guest 1]: and billionaires and whatever.

05:57:24.960 --> 05:57:26.960
[Guest 1]: I try to avoid one or two of those circles

05:57:26.960 --> 05:57:28.960
[Guest 1]: because it unnecessarily creates

05:57:28.960 --> 05:57:30.960
[Guest 1]: it exists as Sathe said

05:57:30.960 --> 05:57:32.960
[Guest 1]: some of these networks exist on a

05:57:32.960 --> 05:57:34.960
[Guest 1]: mere paas yeh hai, tumhare paas

05:57:34.960 --> 05:57:36.960
[Guest 1]: kya hai kind, which I hate as a conversation

05:57:36.960 --> 05:57:38.960
[Guest 1]: I don't understand anything.

05:57:38.960 --> 05:57:40.960
[Guest 1]: If you want to share then it's a very good thing

05:57:40.960 --> 05:57:42.960
[Guest 1]: let's do this together, I have such friends

05:57:42.960 --> 05:57:44.960
[Guest 1]: they are billionaires but they are like let's do this together

05:57:44.960 --> 05:57:46.960
[Guest 1]: which is great, it doesn't come from

05:57:46.960 --> 05:57:48.960
[Guest 1]: a place of privilege, it comes from a place

05:57:48.960 --> 05:57:50.960
[Guest 1]: of let's do this together and that could be

05:57:50.960 --> 05:57:52.960
[Guest 1]: sitting together on a ukulele and singing

05:57:52.960 --> 05:57:54.960
[Guest 1]: stupid songs while having wine and it could also

05:57:54.960 --> 05:57:56.960
[Guest 1]: be going and seeing a play together or doing something

05:57:56.960 --> 05:57:58.960
[Guest 1]: you know to a

05:57:58.960 --> 05:58:00.960
[Guest 1]: certain degree but I just find

05:58:00.960 --> 05:58:02.960
[Guest 1]: that this three flag life concept is something

05:58:02.960 --> 05:58:04.960
[Guest 1]: I currently find very intriguing

05:58:04.960 --> 05:58:06.960
[Guest 1]: right, when somebody said that

05:58:06.960 --> 05:58:08.960
[Guest 1]: if winter is your favorite season would you

05:58:08.960 --> 05:58:10.960
[Guest 1]: not be able to want to chase winter through the year

05:58:10.960 --> 05:58:12.960
[Guest 1]: and if you could you'd be living

05:58:12.960 --> 05:58:14.960
[Guest 1]: in the season of your choice, that is

05:58:14.960 --> 05:58:16.960
[Guest 1]: F off level, what's F off

05:58:16.960 --> 05:58:18.960
[Guest 1]: I am choosing my season, so what's

05:58:18.960 --> 05:58:20.960
[Guest 1]: a F off number, so I was told

05:58:20.960 --> 05:58:22.960
[Guest 1]: it's about 25 million USD

05:58:22.960 --> 05:58:24.960
[Amit Varma]: which is about 200 crores

05:58:24.960 --> 05:58:26.960
[Amit Varma]: so 10 million is FU

05:58:26.960 --> 05:58:28.960
[Guest 1]: and 25 is, because after that

05:58:28.960 --> 05:58:30.960
[Guest 1]: what will you do with more money

05:58:30.960 --> 05:58:32.960
[Guest 1]: and I have calculated this

05:58:32.960 --> 05:58:34.960
[Guest 1]: because we have discussions

05:58:34.960 --> 05:58:36.960
[Guest 1]: with our other friends of ours who have done

05:58:36.960 --> 05:58:38.960
[Unknown]: really well, some are still

05:58:38.960 --> 05:58:40.960
[Unknown]: in the ranks, my discussions are not of 10-15 million

05:58:40.960 --> 05:58:42.960
[Guest 1]: they are not, I mean he doesn't do it

05:58:42.960 --> 05:58:44.960
[Unknown]: because he keeps saying how good you are

05:58:44.960 --> 05:58:46.960
[Guest 2]: that's all he keeps saying

05:58:46.960 --> 05:58:48.960
[Guest 2]: the thought of discussing money is enough for me

05:58:48.960 --> 05:58:50.960
[Guest 1]: no, it's fine

05:58:50.960 --> 05:58:52.960
[Guest 1]: I don't think, I also find

05:58:52.960 --> 05:58:54.960
[Guest 1]: that many people are just trying somewhere

05:58:54.960 --> 05:58:56.960
[Guest 1]: to peg their own success to yours

05:58:56.960 --> 05:58:58.960
[Guest 1]: so many times it's not about

05:58:58.960 --> 05:59:00.960
[Guest 1]: I know so many people who meet me

05:59:00.960 --> 05:59:02.960
[Guest 1]: because I know that they are somewhere saying

05:59:02.960 --> 05:59:04.960
[Guest 1]: wo, very weird

05:59:04.960 --> 05:59:06.960
[Guest 1]: to say but aaj ki roshan hai

05:59:06.960 --> 05:59:08.960
[Guest 1]: jab main chaar TV show de

05:59:08.960 --> 05:59:10.960
[Guest 1]: radio show do event karta tha

05:59:10.960 --> 05:59:12.960
[Guest 1]: aaj many of them do that today right

05:59:12.960 --> 05:59:14.960
[Guest 1]: 2-3 podcasts whatever

05:59:14.960 --> 05:59:16.960
[Guest 1]: and somewhere they are trying to peg that success

05:59:16.960 --> 05:59:18.960
[Guest 1]: now if they want to peg it monetarily

05:59:18.960 --> 05:59:20.960
[Guest 1]: fine, some of them do try to peg it monetarily

05:59:20.960 --> 05:59:22.960
[Guest 1]: sir main tab charge karoon hu iss show ka

05:59:22.960 --> 05:59:24.960
[Guest 1]: kya lagta hai aapko, right

05:59:24.960 --> 05:59:26.960
[Guest 1]: and I know what they want to do, you know

05:59:26.960 --> 05:59:28.960
[Guest 1]: main kya karta hai, would I have done it, have I done it

05:59:28.960 --> 05:59:30.960
[Guest 1]: do I do this much or whatever, and I am very

05:59:30.960 --> 05:59:32.960
[Guest 1]: honest and happy to share

05:59:32.960 --> 05:59:34.960
[Guest 1]: sometimes I am told by Shaheen and others saying

05:59:34.960 --> 05:59:36.960
[Guest 1]: my mother says, itna mat discuss kara karo

05:59:36.960 --> 05:59:38.960
[Guest 1]: paise aur logon ko whatever

05:59:38.960 --> 05:59:40.960
[Guest 1]: I say kya chhen lega yaar, sab tax paid hai

05:59:40.960 --> 05:59:42.960
[Guest 1]: kabhi koi ghalat kaam kiya nahi hai, toh mujhe

05:59:42.960 --> 05:59:44.960
[Guest 1]: koi dar toh hai nahi, nahi nahi, jalan hoti hai

05:59:44.960 --> 05:59:46.960
[Guest 1]: buri nazar lagti hai, sab hota hai

05:59:46.960 --> 05:59:48.960
[Guest 1]: mujhe yaqeen nahi hota hai, sab cheezon mein

05:59:48.960 --> 05:59:50.960
[Guest 1]: I just feel that, you know

05:59:50.960 --> 05:59:52.960
[Guest 1]: and while I am given a lot of

05:59:52.960 --> 05:59:54.960
[Guest 1]: sometimes I am given a lot of gyaan about being

05:59:54.960 --> 05:59:56.960
[Guest 1]: spiritual and religious and whatever

05:59:56.960 --> 05:59:58.960
[Guest 1]: where I have one, very old

05:59:58.960 --> 06:00:00.960
[Guest 1]: my father put up one poster in Lucknow

06:00:00.960 --> 06:00:02.960
[Guest 1]: in our house which said, I think

06:00:02.960 --> 06:00:04.960
[Guest 1]: kafe azmi sahab ka sher tha, ghar se manzil hai bohot

06:00:04.960 --> 06:00:06.960
[Guest 1]: ghar se masjid hai bohot door, chalo aisa

06:00:06.960 --> 06:00:08.960
[Guest 1]: kar lein, kisi rote hui bachche ko hasaya jaye

06:00:08.960 --> 06:00:10.960
[Amit Varma]: Beautiful, and even I understood it

06:00:10.960 --> 06:00:12.960
[Guest 1]: No, no, it's very simple

06:00:12.960 --> 06:00:14.960
[Guest 1]: nahi dekho, achchi shayari mujhe kabhi koi

06:00:14.960 --> 06:00:16.960
[Guest 1]: lagta hai, ko samajh mein aise aajati hai

06:00:16.960 --> 06:00:18.960
[Guest 1]: itni khubsurat baat hai, humanitarianism

06:00:18.960 --> 06:00:20.960
[Guest 1]: I think is genuinely the best religion

06:00:20.960 --> 06:00:22.960
[Guest 1]: main pachaas cheezein karta rehta hu

06:00:22.960 --> 06:00:24.960
[Guest 1]: I don't want to, which I would not

06:00:24.960 --> 06:00:26.960
[Guest 1]: consider charity, they are

06:00:26.960 --> 06:00:28.960
[Guest 1]: can you help someone in their education, if a kid has

06:00:28.960 --> 06:00:30.960
[Guest 1]: got a thing saying, I am doing a photography course

06:00:30.960 --> 06:00:32.960
[Guest 1]: I am short of some money and they put up a post somewhere

06:00:32.960 --> 06:00:34.960
[Guest 1]: do an anonymous donation

06:00:34.960 --> 06:00:36.960
[Guest 1]: to it or whatever, they will never know

06:00:36.960 --> 06:00:38.960
[Guest 1]: of it, but it's fine, when that person

06:00:38.960 --> 06:00:40.960
[Guest 1]: posts that first picture, you will know you were a part

06:00:40.960 --> 06:00:42.960
[Guest 1]: of it, that's good

06:00:42.960 --> 06:00:44.960
[Guest 1]: enough, and if you can do that

06:00:44.960 --> 06:00:46.960
[Guest 1]: it's very fulfilling, main toh bohot karta rehta hu

06:00:46.960 --> 06:00:48.960
[Guest 1]: aisa cheezein, bada maza aata hai, bade khushi lagti

06:00:48.960 --> 06:00:50.960
[Amit Varma]: It's very interesting, there's a friend of

06:00:50.960 --> 06:00:52.960
[Amit Varma]: mine I have known for

06:00:52.960 --> 06:00:54.960
[Amit Varma]: I think 15 or 16 years

06:00:54.960 --> 06:00:56.960
[Amit Varma]: I don't think you guys would have come

06:00:56.960 --> 06:00:58.960
[Amit Varma]: across him, but I was chatting with him recently

06:00:58.960 --> 06:01:00.960
[Amit Varma]: and we were all just sharing stories

06:01:00.960 --> 06:01:02.960
[Amit Varma]: about ourselves and at

06:01:02.960 --> 06:01:04.960
[Amit Varma]: one point he spoke

06:01:04.960 --> 06:01:06.960
[Amit Varma]: about a side of him I never knew

06:01:06.960 --> 06:01:08.960
[Amit Varma]: where he said that I like to give away

06:01:08.960 --> 06:01:10.960
[Amit Varma]: somewhere or the other 10%

06:01:10.960 --> 06:01:12.960
[Amit Varma]: of my money every year, and he started

06:01:12.960 --> 06:01:14.960
[Amit Varma]: speaking about all the little things he does

06:01:14.960 --> 06:01:16.960
[Amit Varma]: and I never knew that side of him because he had never

06:01:16.960 --> 06:01:18.960
[Amit Varma]: revealed it, and he is doing all of it anonymously

06:01:18.960 --> 06:01:20.960
[Amit Varma]: toh kisi ko batana nahi hai

06:01:20.960 --> 06:01:22.960
[Amit Varma]: kisi ko, matlab signal nahi karna hai logon ko

06:01:22.960 --> 06:01:24.960
[Amit Varma]: to see how virtuous I am

06:01:24.960 --> 06:01:26.960
[Amit Varma]: just quietly, baith ke, MBA hai

06:01:26.960 --> 06:01:28.960
[Amit Varma]: banker hai, sab kuch hai, kone

06:01:28.960 --> 06:01:30.960
[Amit Varma]: mein baith ke, kar raha hai, kisi ko

06:01:30.960 --> 06:01:32.960
[Amit Varma]: bataya bhi nahi, you know it took me 15-16

06:01:32.960 --> 06:01:34.960
[Amit Varma]: years in the course of a very specific conversation

06:01:34.960 --> 06:01:36.960
[Amit Varma]: to kind of get it out

06:01:36.960 --> 06:01:38.960
[Amit Varma]: and I was very touched by that, I thought that was a

06:01:38.960 --> 06:01:40.960
[Amit Varma]: lesson because so many of us want to be

06:01:40.960 --> 06:01:42.960
[Guest 2]: good so we can show we are good

06:01:42.960 --> 06:01:44.960
[Unknown]: I have a theory on that

06:01:44.960 --> 06:01:46.960
[Guest 2]: haan bolo sir

06:01:46.960 --> 06:01:48.960
[Guest 2]: mera theory aisa hai ki which is something that

06:01:48.960 --> 06:01:50.960
[Guest 2]: me and Sunandan did

06:01:50.960 --> 06:01:52.960
[Guest 2]: we've been doing for the last 15 years

06:01:52.960 --> 06:01:54.960
[Guest 2]: what I realized was

06:01:54.960 --> 06:01:56.960
[Guest 2]: one great thing about

06:01:56.960 --> 06:01:58.960
[Guest 2]: USA was they made charity cool

06:01:58.960 --> 06:02:00.960
[Guest 2]: okay, and I

06:02:00.960 --> 06:02:02.960
[Guest 2]: think that is important in India

06:02:02.960 --> 06:02:04.960
[Guest 2]: and the way to make charity cool is to

06:02:04.960 --> 06:02:06.960
[Guest 2]: flaunt

06:02:06.960 --> 06:02:08.960
[Guest 2]: doing charity, and

06:02:08.960 --> 06:02:10.960
[Guest 2]: earlier I used to think ki batana nahi, batana nahi

06:02:10.960 --> 06:02:12.960
[Guest 2]: I used to also not say ki apna-apna karo

06:02:12.960 --> 06:02:14.960
[Guest 2]: then I realized yaar, log Instagram

06:02:14.960 --> 06:02:16.960
[Guest 2]: me photo dali rahe hain, faaltoo-faaltoo

06:02:16.960 --> 06:02:18.960
[Guest 2]: photo daal rahe hain, daalne do ki

06:02:18.960 --> 06:02:20.960
[Guest 2]: lakh rupee kisi ki education me diya

06:02:20.960 --> 06:02:22.960
[Guest 2]: wo ek momentum propel

06:02:22.960 --> 06:02:24.960
[Guest 2]: karega, aur phir agar jaise

06:02:24.960 --> 06:02:26.960
[Guest 2]: Warren Buffet dera hai, phir Bill Gates bhi dega

06:02:26.960 --> 06:02:28.960
[Guest 2]: phir ye bhi dega, kyunki unki

06:02:28.960 --> 06:02:30.960
[Guest 2]: pratishtha uske karan, achchi

06:02:30.960 --> 06:02:32.960
[Guest 2]: cheez ke liye apni pratishtha badhane me

06:02:32.960 --> 06:02:34.960
[Guest 2]: koi problem nahi, that's true, and me and

06:02:34.960 --> 06:02:36.960
[Guest 2]: Sunandan actually said that you know tomorrow

06:02:36.960 --> 06:02:38.960
[Guest 2]: we did so many fundraisers

06:02:38.960 --> 06:02:40.960
[Guest 2]: for Baba Amte's foundation we raised

06:02:40.960 --> 06:02:42.960
[Guest 2]: 4 crore rupees, and thankfully you know

06:02:42.960 --> 06:02:44.960
[Guest 2]: MS Dhoni supported it, Sachin has supported

06:02:44.960 --> 06:02:46.960
[Guest 2]: so many things, so many

06:02:46.960 --> 06:02:48.960
[Guest 2]: projects that we are doing, and you will

06:02:48.960 --> 06:02:50.960
[Guest 2]: not believe Amit, we used to tell the

06:02:50.960 --> 06:02:52.960
[Guest 2]: sponsor, tumhara sabka photo

06:02:52.960 --> 06:02:54.960
[Guest 2]: hum nikal ke denge, tum paisa daaloge

06:02:54.960 --> 06:02:56.960
[Guest 2]: to, because for us

06:02:56.960 --> 06:02:58.960
[Guest 2]: we were the, kya usko bolte

06:02:58.960 --> 06:03:00.960
[Guest 2]: pipe of change, humare paas

06:03:00.960 --> 06:03:02.960
[Guest 2]: khud ke paas nahi, hum thoda sa 5%

06:03:02.960 --> 06:03:04.960
[Guest 2]: contribute karenge, but Sunandan said

06:03:04.960 --> 06:03:06.960
[Guest 2]: that our duty is to connect

06:03:06.960 --> 06:03:08.960
[Guest 2]: Robin Hood, jiske paas

06:03:08.960 --> 06:03:10.960
[Guest 2]: paisa hai, usko with

06:03:10.960 --> 06:03:12.960
[Guest 2]: achcha cause, uske liye agar

06:03:12.960 --> 06:03:14.960
[Guest 2]: hum log ko apni jaan deke, photograph

06:03:14.960 --> 06:03:16.960
[Guest 2]: nikal ke uske

06:03:16.960 --> 06:03:18.960
[Guest 2]: bachche ka mundan me bhi kisi ko lana

06:03:18.960 --> 06:03:20.960
[Guest 2]: pade to, hume koi isme

06:03:20.960 --> 06:03:22.960
[Guest 2]: nahi hona chahiye, because the outcome

06:03:22.960 --> 06:03:24.960
[Guest 2]: of that is that 10,000

06:03:24.960 --> 06:03:26.960
[Guest 2]: people are having food, and

06:03:26.960 --> 06:03:28.960
[Guest 2]: I realized this when I

06:03:28.960 --> 06:03:30.960
[Guest 2]: saw one guy said, and then

06:03:30.960 --> 06:03:32.960
[Guest 2]: suddenly the other guy would say, kya

06:03:32.960 --> 06:03:34.960
[Guest 2]: tumne kiya tha, ye bhi

06:03:34.960 --> 06:03:36.960
[Guest 2]: ek charitable

06:03:36.960 --> 06:03:38.960
[Guest 2]: hai, so suddenly that guy paid money

06:03:38.960 --> 06:03:40.960
[Guest 2]: for our orphanage foundation

06:03:40.960 --> 06:03:42.960
[Guest 2]: so I think it's time that

06:03:42.960 --> 06:03:44.960
[Guest 2]: we celebrate people who are

06:03:44.960 --> 06:03:46.960
[Guest 2]: giving money, or doing something

06:03:46.960 --> 06:03:48.960
[Guest 2]: good, because if it

06:03:48.960 --> 06:03:50.960
[Guest 2]: creates a chain reaction, I know

06:03:50.960 --> 06:03:52.960
[Guest 2]: it may not be your personal thing to do,

06:03:52.960 --> 06:03:54.960
[Guest 2]: that's absolutely fine,

06:03:54.960 --> 06:03:56.960
[Guest 2]: it's your personal choice, but if you can

06:03:56.960 --> 06:03:58.960
[Guest 2]: create a movement that's like

06:03:58.960 --> 06:04:00.960
[Guest 2]: what it has happened in America

06:04:00.960 --> 06:04:02.960
[Guest 2]: and even 1%

06:04:02.960 --> 06:04:04.960
[Guest 2]: of our billionaires start

06:04:04.960 --> 06:04:06.960
[Guest 2]: putting money back into society,

06:04:06.960 --> 06:04:08.960
[Guest 2]: I think we have enough money to take care of our

06:04:08.960 --> 06:04:10.960
[Amit Varma]: country. I think to be honest, people like

06:04:10.960 --> 06:04:12.960
[Amit Varma]: Azim Premji and the Nellikini Foundation

06:04:12.960 --> 06:04:14.960
[Guest 2]: and all of these people do put a lot of

06:04:14.960 --> 06:04:16.960
[Guest 2]: work. And they have started this coolness

06:04:16.960 --> 06:04:18.960
[Guest 2]: see today in any Azim Premji

06:04:18.960 --> 06:04:20.960
[Guest 2]: conversation, what is the first thing

06:04:20.960 --> 06:04:22.960
[Guest 2]: you tell each other?

06:04:22.960 --> 06:04:24.960
[Guest 2]: Not that he built a great company,

06:04:24.960 --> 06:04:26.960
[Guest 2]: not that he built one of the

06:04:26.960 --> 06:04:28.960
[Guest 2]: most successful businesses in the country,

06:04:28.960 --> 06:04:30.960
[Guest 2]: sab diya boss, uska dekho

06:04:30.960 --> 06:04:32.960
[Guest 2]: na ahuda khud, usne great

06:04:32.960 --> 06:04:34.960
[Guest 2]: kaam kiya hai, but uske karan

06:04:34.960 --> 06:04:36.960
[Guest 2]: phir uske baad Nadars aaye,

06:04:36.960 --> 06:04:38.960
[Guest 2]: Godrejis kar rahe hain, even for that

06:04:38.960 --> 06:04:40.960
[Guest 2]: matter, new age companies are doing it

06:04:40.960 --> 06:04:42.960
[Guest 2]: because, like you know the other day

06:04:42.960 --> 06:04:44.960
[Guest 2]: one of the guys who is an

06:04:44.960 --> 06:04:46.960
[Guest 2]: agency for Baijus, I told him

06:04:46.960 --> 06:04:48.960
[Guest 2]: that you know, one of the biggest problems of

06:04:48.960 --> 06:04:50.960
[Guest 2]: education companies is that the teacher

06:04:50.960 --> 06:04:52.960
[Guest 2]: is becoming richer than the student.

06:04:52.960 --> 06:04:54.960
[Guest 2]: You should be doing the maximum

06:04:54.960 --> 06:04:56.960
[Guest 2]: giving it back to society because

06:04:56.960 --> 06:04:58.960
[Guest 2]: you are making money through education. Only

06:04:58.960 --> 06:05:00.960
[Guest 2]: then you will put in a word ki theek hai hum

06:05:00.960 --> 06:05:02.960
[Guest 2]: billionaire hain, magar hum we are plowing it back

06:05:02.960 --> 06:05:04.960
[Guest 2]: into the system. So new age companies,

06:05:04.960 --> 06:05:06.960
[Guest 2]: startup companies I interact with,

06:05:06.960 --> 06:05:08.960
[Guest 2]: I always tell these guys, whatever,

06:05:08.960 --> 06:05:10.960
[Guest 2]: ki boss, jab tumko itna

06:05:10.960 --> 06:05:12.960
[Guest 2]: paisa mil raha hai, daalo boss,

06:05:12.960 --> 06:05:14.960
[Guest 2]: daalo, system mein daalo, because

06:05:14.960 --> 06:05:16.960
[Guest 2]: usse jo milega, wo tumhare

06:05:16.960 --> 06:05:18.960
[Amit Varma]: nizam se nahi milega.

06:05:18.960 --> 06:05:20.960
[Guest 2]: But wo young age mein itna nahi samajhta hai, probably.

06:05:20.960 --> 06:05:22.960
[Amit Varma]: And also then they'll

06:05:22.960 --> 06:05:24.960
[Unknown]: negotiate with you, ki you know,

06:05:24.960 --> 06:05:26.960
[Guest 2]: victory!

06:05:26.960 --> 06:05:28.960
[Guest 2]: Victory!

06:05:28.960 --> 06:05:30.960
[Guest 2]: But that I have told all my sponsors.

06:05:30.960 --> 06:05:32.960
[Guest 2]: Tu paisa charity mein daalega, main tere liye

06:05:32.960 --> 06:05:34.960
[Guest 2]: show karega. Free?

06:05:34.960 --> 06:05:36.960
[Guest 2]: No problem at all. That's why many people call me,

06:05:36.960 --> 06:05:38.960
[Guest 2]: yaar yeh kar do na. Charity hai,

06:05:38.960 --> 06:05:40.960
[Guest 2]: obviously there has to be a genuineness in the charity.

06:05:40.960 --> 06:05:42.960
[Amit Varma]: Woh charity ke naam pe bhi aaj,

06:05:42.960 --> 06:05:44.960
[Amit Varma]: bahot ullu banate hain.

06:05:44.960 --> 06:05:46.960
[Unknown]: Amit Verma podcast fund,

06:05:46.960 --> 06:05:48.960
[Guest 2]: aapko deh dunga bank account ka, aap karwalo.

06:05:48.960 --> 06:05:50.960
[Guest 2]: Sir, apne liye best hai na,

06:05:50.960 --> 06:05:52.960
[Guest 2]: charitable event hai, toh hum karenge,

06:05:52.960 --> 06:05:54.960
[Guest 2]: toh direct humko, but aaj kal

06:05:54.960 --> 06:05:56.960
[Guest 2]: main ek naya karne lagao. Kyuki paisa kahan

06:05:56.960 --> 06:05:58.960
[Guest 2]: jaata hai, wo samajhta nahi. Toh mai boltao ki,

06:05:58.960 --> 06:06:00.960
[Guest 2]: mera jo price hai na,

06:06:00.960 --> 06:06:02.960
[Guest 2]: let me hand over the cheque to the person.

06:06:02.960 --> 06:06:04.960
[Guest 2]: Toh fir

06:06:04.960 --> 06:06:06.960
[Guest 2]: usko bhi guarantee ho jaati hai.

06:06:06.960 --> 06:06:08.960
[Guest 2]: And even in all the charitable work that

06:06:08.960 --> 06:06:10.960
[Guest 2]: we've done, I don't like to call it

06:06:10.960 --> 06:06:12.960
[Guest 2]: charitable work, it's more empowering work.

06:06:12.960 --> 06:06:14.960
[Guest 2]: We call the kids,

06:06:14.960 --> 06:06:16.960
[Guest 2]: we tell the donor,

06:06:16.960 --> 06:06:18.960
[Guest 2]: and say, you exchange.

06:06:18.960 --> 06:06:20.960
[Guest 2]: Because what happens is, when you put up

06:06:20.960 --> 06:06:22.960
[Guest 2]: an organisation, people start

06:06:22.960 --> 06:06:24.960
[Guest 2]: suspecting your integrity. That is something

06:06:24.960 --> 06:06:26.960
[Guest 2]: I get really hurt about.

06:06:26.960 --> 06:06:28.960
[Guest 2]: Ki yaar yeh saatein nahi kiya hoga, isme se

06:06:28.960 --> 06:06:30.960
[Guest 2]: 10 rupee khala, nahi yaar mereko wo karna hi nahi hai.

06:06:30.960 --> 06:06:32.960
[Guest 2]: Yeh milo, isko 10 jute chahiye,

06:06:32.960 --> 06:06:34.960
[Guest 2]: tumare paas 40,000 hai,

06:06:34.960 --> 06:06:36.960
[Guest 2]: sportsman ko kya chahiye? Sportsman ka

06:06:36.960 --> 06:06:38.960
[Guest 2]: kharcha empowering ke liye simple hai,

06:06:38.960 --> 06:06:40.960
[Guest 2]: usko jute chahiye, aur usko

06:06:40.960 --> 06:06:42.960
[Guest 2]: international jab he wants to travel

06:06:42.960 --> 06:06:44.960
[Guest 2]: for a sporting event,

06:06:44.960 --> 06:06:46.960
[Guest 2]: you need to pay for his fees.

06:06:46.960 --> 06:06:48.960
[Guest 2]: Today the success of Japan against Germany is

06:06:48.960 --> 06:06:50.960
[Guest 2]: because all Japanese players are playing Bundesliga.

06:06:50.960 --> 06:06:52.960
[Guest 2]: And today,

06:06:52.960 --> 06:06:54.960
[Guest 2]: unless we empower players to play

06:06:54.960 --> 06:06:56.960
[Guest 2]: global leagues, which costs a lot of money,

06:06:56.960 --> 06:06:58.960
[Guest 2]: you will never create a champion.

06:06:58.960 --> 06:07:00.960
[Guest 2]: So now my next project is to make sure that

06:07:00.960 --> 06:07:02.960
[Guest 2]: the sporting ecosystem me,

06:07:02.960 --> 06:07:04.960
[Guest 2]: I'm tying up with GoSports

06:07:04.960 --> 06:07:06.960
[Guest 2]: and a few other organisations, where we are

06:07:06.960 --> 06:07:08.960
[Guest 2]: trying to raise money to

06:07:08.960 --> 06:07:10.960
[Guest 2]: look after international expenditure

06:07:10.960 --> 06:07:12.960
[Guest 2]: of sports people. Half the

06:07:12.960 --> 06:07:14.960
[Guest 2]: job done. So yeh

06:07:14.960 --> 06:07:16.960
[Guest 1]: karne maza aata hai.

06:07:16.960 --> 06:07:18.960
[Guest 1]: Personal charity and

06:07:18.960 --> 06:07:20.960
[Guest 1]: building charity

06:07:20.960 --> 06:07:22.960
[Guest 1]: as a line of

06:07:22.960 --> 06:07:24.960
[Guest 1]: work. That's a separate thing.

06:07:24.960 --> 06:07:26.960
[Guest 1]: And you've done it very smartly.

06:07:26.960 --> 06:07:28.960
[Guest 1]: With Bawra's we did it.

06:07:28.960 --> 06:07:30.960
[Guest 1]: Tell me about Bawra's.

06:07:30.960 --> 06:07:32.960
[Guest 2]: Oh Bawra's was a great idea

06:07:32.960 --> 06:07:34.960
[Guest 2]: which unfortunately did not continue.

06:07:34.960 --> 06:07:36.960
[Guest 2]: But the work continued

06:07:36.960 --> 06:07:38.960
[Guest 2]: in our individual levels. And that

06:07:38.960 --> 06:07:40.960
[Guest 2]: happened during a drunken evening with

06:07:40.960 --> 06:07:42.960
[Guest 2]: Shantanu Moitra,

06:07:42.960 --> 06:07:44.960
[Guest 2]: I think Sonan Kirkire was there.

06:07:44.960 --> 06:07:46.960
[Guest 2]: And in one of the earlier meetings

06:07:46.960 --> 06:07:48.960
[Guest 2]: Shreya Ghoshal was there, Kaushiki Chakravarti

06:07:48.960 --> 06:07:50.960
[Guest 2]: was there. And obviously

06:07:50.960 --> 06:07:52.960
[Guest 1]: Roshan you were also there.

06:07:52.960 --> 06:07:54.960
[Guest 1]: We all were sitting.

06:07:54.960 --> 06:07:56.960
[Guest 1]: Nilesh was there.

06:07:56.960 --> 06:07:58.960
[Guest 2]: Sameer was there. And the whole

06:07:58.960 --> 06:08:00.960
[Guest 2]: idea came from actually Shantanu.

06:08:00.960 --> 06:08:02.960
[Guest 2]: Where he said yaar, we have

06:08:02.960 --> 06:08:04.960
[Guest 2]: been reasonably successful

06:08:04.960 --> 06:08:06.960
[Guest 2]: artists. And it's time

06:08:06.960 --> 06:08:08.960
[Guest 2]: to empower

06:08:08.960 --> 06:08:10.960
[Guest 2]: the next generation.

06:08:10.960 --> 06:08:12.960
[Guest 2]: So, and that

06:08:12.960 --> 06:08:14.960
[Guest 2]: is something me and Sunandan were already

06:08:14.960 --> 06:08:16.960
[Guest 2]: doing in our little way. So I said

06:08:16.960 --> 06:08:18.960
[Guest 2]: hey, great idea. So how do we

06:08:18.960 --> 06:08:20.960
[Guest 2]: do it? So we will do concerts and

06:08:20.960 --> 06:08:22.960
[Guest 2]: the money that will come out of the concerts, we

06:08:22.960 --> 06:08:24.960
[Guest 2]: will empower the

06:08:24.960 --> 06:08:26.960
[Guest 2]: next person who

06:08:26.960 --> 06:08:28.960
[Guest 2]: is doing something interesting in

06:08:28.960 --> 06:08:30.960
[Guest 2]: unconventional professions. And that

06:08:30.960 --> 06:08:32.960
[Guest 2]: came from Sonan Kirkire's song

06:08:32.960 --> 06:08:34.960
[Guest 2]: Bawra Man Dekhne Chala Ek Sapna

06:08:34.960 --> 06:08:36.960
[Guest 2]: Ki Jitne Bawrein Hai Is Duniya Mein

06:08:36.960 --> 06:08:38.960
[Guest 2]: Agar Unko Hum Empower Karoge Toh

06:08:38.960 --> 06:08:40.960
[Guest 2]: Great Kaam Honge. And that's where

06:08:40.960 --> 06:08:42.960
[Guest 2]: we did Bawras.

06:08:42.960 --> 06:08:44.960
[Guest 2]: And suddenly I got a

06:08:44.960 --> 06:08:46.960
[Guest 2]: call from Shantanu one day

06:08:46.960 --> 06:08:48.960
[Guest 2]: that Krishna Patil, after

06:08:48.960 --> 06:08:50.960
[Guest 2]: climbing Mount Everest, did not have

06:08:50.960 --> 06:08:52.960
[Guest 2]: money. She was the youngest to climb

06:08:52.960 --> 06:08:54.960
[Guest 2]: Mount Everest at that time. And

06:08:54.960 --> 06:08:56.960
[Guest 2]: she did not have money

06:08:56.960 --> 06:08:58.960
[Guest 2]: to climb the next mountain

06:08:58.960 --> 06:09:00.960
[Guest 2]: which is Mount Makalu, which is a tougher mountain.

06:09:00.960 --> 06:09:02.960
[Guest 2]: Everest relatively in the 8000 meters

06:09:02.960 --> 06:09:04.960
[Guest 2]: is an easier

06:09:04.960 --> 06:09:06.960
[Amit Varma]: mountain though it's the highest. Everest toh

06:09:06.960 --> 06:09:08.960
[Amit Varma]: kutte bhi climb kar lete hai.

06:09:10.960 --> 06:09:12.960
[Amit Varma]: For the listeners, that's a meme that

06:09:12.960 --> 06:09:14.960
[Amit Varma]: we have that whenever

06:09:14.960 --> 06:09:16.960
[Amit Varma]: somebody talks about doing something, we say

06:09:16.960 --> 06:09:18.960
[Amit Varma]: yeh toh kutte bhi kar lete hai. And once

06:09:18.960 --> 06:09:20.960
[Amit Varma]: I was called out on it, I think when I was at

06:09:20.960 --> 06:09:22.960
[Amit Varma]: my friend Gaurav Chintamani's studio

06:09:22.960 --> 06:09:24.960
[Amit Varma]: in Delhi, where it was something to the effect of I said

06:09:24.960 --> 06:09:26.960
[Amit Varma]: Martini toh kutte bhi pee lete hai. And

06:09:26.960 --> 06:09:28.960
[Amit Varma]: somebody said nahi, I call your bluff.

06:09:28.960 --> 06:09:30.960
[Amit Varma]: Dikhao mujhe. Toh maine google

06:09:30.960 --> 06:09:32.960
[Amit Varma]: kiya aur photo dikhaya, video dikhaya

06:09:32.960 --> 06:09:34.960
[Amit Varma]: ki kutta martini pee raha hai.

06:09:34.960 --> 06:09:36.960
[Amit Varma]: So the basic funda is ki kutte actually

06:09:36.960 --> 06:09:38.960
[Amit Varma]: kuch bhi kar lete hai, literally.

06:09:38.960 --> 06:09:40.960
[Guest 2]: But I'm sorry, it's a bizarre

06:09:40.960 --> 06:09:42.960
[Guest 2]: meme, but kindly continue.

06:09:42.960 --> 06:09:44.960
[Guest 2]: In today's time when everybody is

06:09:44.960 --> 06:09:46.960
[Unknown]: suffering from a lot of anxiety issues,

06:09:46.960 --> 06:09:48.960
[Unknown]: the reason, the most

06:09:48.960 --> 06:09:50.960
[Guest 2]: biggest, best profession is kutta.

06:09:50.960 --> 06:09:52.960
[Guest 2]: Because getting the most love.

06:09:54.960 --> 06:09:56.960
[Amit Varma]: Best profession is kutta.

06:09:56.960 --> 06:09:58.960
[Amit Varma]: What do you want to do for a living? I want to be petted.

06:10:00.960 --> 06:10:02.960
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, so haan, aap keh rahe the.

06:10:02.960 --> 06:10:04.960
[Guest 2]: Toh main kaha tha? Bawaraj.

06:10:04.960 --> 06:10:06.960
[Guest 2]: Toh Bawaraj shuru hua, Krishna Patil,

06:10:06.960 --> 06:10:08.960
[Guest 2]: actually bahut emotional story thi,

06:10:08.960 --> 06:10:10.960
[Guest 2]: ki Shantanu aur

06:10:10.960 --> 06:10:12.960
[Guest 2]: hum log baithe the, toh Krishna ko poocha ki

06:10:12.960 --> 06:10:14.960
[Guest 2]: kaise lagta hai to be on Mount Everest.

06:10:14.960 --> 06:10:16.960
[Guest 2]: He said I climb Mount Everest

06:10:16.960 --> 06:10:18.960
[Guest 2]: and when I looked down, I said how am I

06:10:18.960 --> 06:10:20.960
[Guest 2]: going to repay this loan? Because

06:10:20.960 --> 06:10:22.960
[Guest 2]: she had been given loan by I think

06:10:22.960 --> 06:10:24.960
[Guest 2]: Saraswat Bank to the extent of 30 lakh

06:10:24.960 --> 06:10:26.960
[Guest 2]: rupees, very expensive to climb Everest.

06:10:26.960 --> 06:10:28.960
[Guest 2]: So that kind of

06:10:28.960 --> 06:10:30.960
[Guest 2]: you know, I said that you know, after climbing

06:10:30.960 --> 06:10:32.960
[Guest 2]: Everest, if you are worried about how to

06:10:32.960 --> 06:10:34.960
[Guest 2]: repay the loan, then we got to do

06:10:34.960 --> 06:10:36.960
[Guest 2]: something. And that

06:10:36.960 --> 06:10:38.960
[Guest 2]: got me thinking as to what we should be

06:10:38.960 --> 06:10:40.960
[Guest 2]: doing and we said chalo let's start

06:10:40.960 --> 06:10:42.960
[Guest 2]: with a Bawaraj concert. And we did

06:10:42.960 --> 06:10:44.960
[Guest 2]: that concert at Rang Sharda.

06:10:44.960 --> 06:10:46.960
[Guest 2]: I got Aditya Birla

06:10:46.960 --> 06:10:48.960
[Guest 2]: to fund that concert and all the

06:10:48.960 --> 06:10:50.960
[Guest 2]: money, thankfully we had

06:10:50.960 --> 06:10:52.960
[Guest 2]: Roshan supporting on the console.

06:10:52.960 --> 06:10:54.960
[Guest 1]: He did the show. I was directing.

06:10:54.960 --> 06:10:56.960
[Guest 2]: I was just generally console directing.

06:10:56.960 --> 06:10:58.960
[Guest 1]: And our Encompass crew

06:10:58.960 --> 06:11:00.960
[Guest 1]: because I went company came to help out.

06:11:00.960 --> 06:11:02.960
[Guest 2]: Came to help out. Then we got

06:11:02.960 --> 06:11:04.960
[Guest 1]: as I said Aditya Birla group. Mandira

06:11:04.960 --> 06:11:06.960
[Guest 1]: came. Mandira came. Hosted a little bit.

06:11:06.960 --> 06:11:08.960
[Guest 1]: Dia Mirza came.

06:11:08.960 --> 06:11:10.960
[Guest 2]: Shan came.

06:11:10.960 --> 06:11:12.960
[Guest 2]: And all these guys supported. We raised money

06:11:12.960 --> 06:11:14.960
[Guest 2]: and based on that, we collected

06:11:14.960 --> 06:11:16.960
[Guest 2]: this corpus and she went to Mount Makalu.

06:11:16.960 --> 06:11:18.960
[Guest 2]: So that got us very excited.

06:11:18.960 --> 06:11:20.960
[Guest 2]: But you know, fundraising

06:11:20.960 --> 06:11:22.960
[Guest 2]: is not an easy thing. I spent

06:11:22.960 --> 06:11:24.960
[Guest 2]: nearly a month and a half

06:11:24.960 --> 06:11:26.960
[Guest 2]: getting those funds. So

06:11:26.960 --> 06:11:28.960
[Guest 2]: then what happened is, this was another

06:11:28.960 --> 06:11:30.960
[Guest 2]: very interesting thing we did.

06:11:30.960 --> 06:11:32.960
[Guest 2]: We tied up with Gosports and I remember

06:11:32.960 --> 06:11:34.960
[Guest 2]: that was the time when Gopichand was

06:11:34.960 --> 06:11:36.960
[Guest 2]: not getting money

06:11:36.960 --> 06:11:38.960
[Guest 2]: to even run the academy.

06:11:38.960 --> 06:11:40.960
[Guest 2]: Probably the Andhra government

06:11:40.960 --> 06:11:42.960
[Guest 2]: had given him all the infrastructure but

06:11:42.960 --> 06:11:44.960
[Guest 2]: running costs and all is not easy

06:11:44.960 --> 06:11:46.960
[Guest 2]: to build so many champions.

06:11:46.960 --> 06:11:48.960
[Guest 2]: So Gosports said that can you do an

06:11:48.960 --> 06:11:50.960
[Guest 2]: event. So we did one event in

06:11:50.960 --> 06:11:52.960
[Guest 2]: this

06:11:52.960 --> 06:11:54.960
[Guest 2]: smash where Ankur Tiwari

06:11:54.960 --> 06:11:56.960
[Guest 2]: and Arpita and Jasleen Royal

06:11:56.960 --> 06:11:58.960
[Guest 2]: I got them to perform.

06:11:58.960 --> 06:12:00.960
[Guest 2]: Swanand also performed. We raised money

06:12:00.960 --> 06:12:02.960
[Guest 2]: and can you imagine at that point

06:12:02.960 --> 06:12:04.960
[Guest 2]: of time it was some 8-10

06:12:04.960 --> 06:12:06.960
[Guest 2]: lakhs or something like that we raised.

06:12:06.960 --> 06:12:08.960
[Guest 2]: And Gopi from

06:12:08.960 --> 06:12:10.960
[Guest 1]: Hyderabad had come down

06:12:10.960 --> 06:12:12.960
[Guest 2]: for this event and we presented

06:12:12.960 --> 06:12:14.960
[Guest 2]: the cheque to Gosports who had an

06:12:14.960 --> 06:12:16.960
[Guest 2]: association with Gopichand and now today

06:12:16.960 --> 06:12:18.960
[Guest 2]: Gopichand probably would be

06:12:18.960 --> 06:12:20.960
[Guest 2]: charging thrice that amount for his personal

06:12:20.960 --> 06:12:22.960
[Guest 2]: experience. So I am very proud

06:12:22.960 --> 06:12:24.960
[Guest 2]: to say that in the initial years

06:12:24.960 --> 06:12:26.960
[Guest 2]: of the badminton movement we played

06:12:26.960 --> 06:12:28.960
[Guest 2]: a very small role in kind of doing

06:12:28.960 --> 06:12:30.960
[Guest 2]: that. We then raised money for

06:12:30.960 --> 06:12:32.960
[Guest 2]: I think 3 or 4 very smart

06:12:32.960 --> 06:12:34.960
[Guest 2]: IIT guys by doing a concert

06:12:34.960 --> 06:12:36.960
[Guest 2]: in IIT Bombay.

06:12:36.960 --> 06:12:38.960
[Guest 2]: So this continued for a while

06:12:38.960 --> 06:12:40.960
[Guest 2]: but then we realized

06:12:40.960 --> 06:12:42.960
[Guest 2]: we were getting too busy and the

06:12:42.960 --> 06:12:44.960
[Guest 2]: one big funder that

06:12:44.960 --> 06:12:46.960
[Guest 2]: we needed that if we get

06:12:46.960 --> 06:12:48.960
[Guest 2]: 2 crores then we can

06:12:48.960 --> 06:12:50.960
[Guest 2]: line up concerts but the money

06:12:50.960 --> 06:12:52.960
[Guest 2]: problem will be solved. Because I can take

06:12:52.960 --> 06:12:54.960
[Guest 2]: artist time to do concerts

06:12:54.960 --> 06:12:56.960
[Guest 2]: but then to sell it and all was

06:12:56.960 --> 06:12:58.960
[Guest 2]: taking too much of my time and that's why it

06:12:58.960 --> 06:13:00.960
[Guest 1]: kind of took a back seat. Also the 3

06:13:00.960 --> 06:13:02.960
[Guest 1]: Bawaras were Bawaras right?

06:13:02.960 --> 06:13:04.960
[Guest 1]: These Bawaras are doing their own work

06:13:04.960 --> 06:13:06.960
[Guest 2]: and they are artists

06:13:06.960 --> 06:13:08.960
[Guest 1]: who are busy also. And you know

06:13:08.960 --> 06:13:10.960
[Guest 1]: we were discussing

06:13:10.960 --> 06:13:12.960
[Guest 1]: all these ideas about how do we enable

06:13:12.960 --> 06:13:14.960
[Guest 1]: so with me it was how do we enable creators

06:13:14.960 --> 06:13:16.960
[Guest 1]: with him it was how do we enable

06:13:16.960 --> 06:13:18.960
[Guest 1]: anybody who has a cause

06:13:18.960 --> 06:13:20.960
[Guest 1]: or a purpose which is worthwhile therefore it was sports

06:13:20.960 --> 06:13:22.960
[Guest 1]: and again see it comes from what is your

06:13:22.960 --> 06:13:24.960
[Guest 1]: subset of interest right? So

06:13:24.960 --> 06:13:26.960
[Guest 1]: with them it seemed to have become sports for a

06:13:26.960 --> 06:13:28.960
[Guest 1]: period of time. And honestly even today

06:13:28.960 --> 06:13:30.960
[Guest 1]: while Bawaras might be more in spirit

06:13:30.960 --> 06:13:32.960
[Guest 1]: but I often see them doing

06:13:32.960 --> 06:13:34.960
[Guest 1]: even when they have these couple of...

06:13:34.960 --> 06:13:36.960
[Guest 1]: whatever and things

06:13:36.960 --> 06:13:38.960
[Guest 1]: in that I see that Bawara's spirit

06:13:38.960 --> 06:13:40.960
[Guest 1]: you know when it's you and there's Shreya

06:13:40.960 --> 06:13:42.960
[Guest 1]: and there's that Aditya gentleman

06:13:42.960 --> 06:13:44.960
[Guest 1]: Mr. Ghosh and all of these people

06:13:44.960 --> 06:13:46.960
[Guest 1]: I see that he's still got that network

06:13:46.960 --> 06:13:48.960
[Guest 1]: maybe he'll work it. Again see for

06:13:48.960 --> 06:13:50.960
[Guest 1]: Saty the issue was I can do this

06:13:50.960 --> 06:13:52.960
[Guest 1]: he can do that now beyond this

06:13:52.960 --> 06:13:54.960
[Guest 1]: what should I do?

06:13:54.960 --> 06:13:56.960
[Guest 1]: That is it. I think somewhere

06:13:56.960 --> 06:13:58.960
[Guest 2]: that becomes a bit of a thing

06:13:58.960 --> 06:14:00.960
[Guest 2]: hurdle. Then I have to go into the entrepreneur experience

06:14:00.960 --> 06:14:02.960
[Guest 2]: which I don't want to do

06:14:02.960 --> 06:14:04.960
[Guest 2]: and that stops me from taking any

06:14:04.960 --> 06:14:06.960
[Guest 2]: idea to the next level because

06:14:06.960 --> 06:14:08.960
[Guest 2]: the moment you become an entrepreneur

06:14:08.960 --> 06:14:10.960
[Guest 2]: then all your time

06:14:10.960 --> 06:14:12.960
[Guest 2]: goes and that is why Roshan Abbas

06:14:12.960 --> 06:14:14.960
[Guest 2]: is special because he can manage both

06:14:14.960 --> 06:14:16.960
[Guest 2]: these. Because he's good at delegation

06:14:16.960 --> 06:14:18.960
[Guest 2]: I don't enjoy it. And

06:14:18.960 --> 06:14:20.960
[Guest 2]: because he has those

06:14:20.960 --> 06:14:22.960
[Unknown]: FU, Tefum, FU goals and all

06:14:22.960 --> 06:14:24.960
[Unknown]: I don't have those goals. I just need a basic security

06:14:24.960 --> 06:14:26.960
[Guest 2]: and the other person

06:14:26.960 --> 06:14:28.960
[Amit Varma]: sends a good ticket and goes around the world

06:14:28.960 --> 06:14:30.960
[Amit Varma]: I feel you are just like me except much

06:14:30.960 --> 06:14:32.960
[Guest 1]: richer. I'll tell you

06:14:32.960 --> 06:14:34.960
[Unknown]: one more thing Aditya. You know what happens?

06:14:34.960 --> 06:14:36.960
[Unknown]: I don't wear a watch. I told him this

06:14:36.960 --> 06:14:38.960
[Guest 1]: long back. What happens?

06:14:38.960 --> 06:14:40.960
[Guest 1]: It's a thing I had to, I was

06:14:40.960 --> 06:14:42.960
[Guest 1]: taught over a period of time because I remember

06:14:42.960 --> 06:14:44.960
[Guest 1]: once or twice speaking to

06:14:44.960 --> 06:14:46.960
[Guest 1]: people I would say who were similar in terms of

06:14:46.960 --> 06:14:48.960
[Guest 1]: they were entrepreneurs and they were performers

06:14:48.960 --> 06:14:50.960
[Guest 1]: and I would say that what is the

06:14:50.960 --> 06:14:52.960
[Guest 1]: difference that you do? He said listen

06:14:52.960 --> 06:14:54.960
[Guest 1]: when I enter a business meeting

06:14:54.960 --> 06:14:56.960
[Guest 1]: I leave my showman, I leave my

06:14:56.960 --> 06:14:58.960
[Guest 1]: performer coat outside

06:14:58.960 --> 06:15:00.960
[Guest 1]: I keep the performance but I

06:15:00.960 --> 06:15:02.960
[Guest 1]: put the rest of that baggage of being a performer

06:15:02.960 --> 06:15:04.960
[Guest 1]: outside because if you actually start evaluating

06:15:04.960 --> 06:15:06.960
[Guest 1]: for Satay it would be easier

06:15:06.960 --> 06:15:08.960
[Guest 1]: to go 4 days, do a show and give that

06:15:08.960 --> 06:15:10.960
[Guest 1]: money because that would be equivalent

06:15:10.960 --> 06:15:12.960
[Unknown]: to that amount. No but you know Roshan you need to like that

06:15:12.960 --> 06:15:14.960
[Unknown]: Exactly. See in your case

06:15:14.960 --> 06:15:16.960
[Guest 2]: creation and putting that that's why you

06:15:16.960 --> 06:15:18.960
[Guest 2]: say execution, execution, execution. Correct.

06:15:18.960 --> 06:15:20.960
[Guest 2]: You like to do that process. I get

06:15:20.960 --> 06:15:22.960
[Guest 1]: bored by that. I also tell him like

06:15:22.960 --> 06:15:24.960
[Guest 1]: for example I said you know and this was another thing

06:15:24.960 --> 06:15:26.960
[Guest 1]: one of our common friends once said we were having a

06:15:26.960 --> 06:15:28.960
[Guest 1]: chat and he said he says me and my

06:15:28.960 --> 06:15:30.960
[Guest 1]: ex-partner in my business Sukrit

06:15:30.960 --> 06:15:32.960
[Guest 1]: he used to say that when we are in the hall

06:15:32.960 --> 06:15:34.960
[Guest 1]: our eyes sparkle

06:15:34.960 --> 06:15:36.960
[Guest 1]: because we see the light and count

06:15:36.960 --> 06:15:38.960
[Guest 1]: if four were here it could have been this

06:15:38.960 --> 06:15:40.960
[Guest 1]: if it was in the chair it could have been that

06:15:40.960 --> 06:15:42.960
[Guest 1]: you are playing because we are experiential

06:15:42.960 --> 06:15:44.960
[Guest 1]: people, we like to play

06:15:44.960 --> 06:15:46.960
[Guest 1]: with every sense and therefore

06:15:46.960 --> 06:15:48.960
[Guest 1]: the more you put us outside we enjoy

06:15:48.960 --> 06:15:50.960
[Guest 1]: that more. Our

06:15:50.960 --> 06:15:52.960
[Guest 1]: bias for action is because we

06:15:52.960 --> 06:15:54.960
[Guest 1]: have to do that. You know I'll tell you one thing, Bawra's

06:15:54.960 --> 06:15:56.960
[Guest 1]: happened and the only role I had to play in Bawra's was

06:15:56.960 --> 06:15:58.960
[Guest 1]: that which day do we have to do it

06:15:58.960 --> 06:16:00.960
[Guest 1]: and he said this date is free and we

06:16:00.960 --> 06:16:02.960
[Guest 1]: booked the date remember and I said

06:16:02.960 --> 06:16:04.960
[Unknown]: this date is now booked at Rang Shah. Now you have to do it

06:16:04.960 --> 06:16:06.960
[Guest 1]: and then you did it. Otherwise he wouldn't have done it

06:16:06.960 --> 06:16:08.960
[Guest 1]: I mean he would have done it but maybe

06:16:08.960 --> 06:16:10.960
[Guest 1]: after 2-3 months but it was that you know you have to put the gun

06:16:10.960 --> 06:16:12.960
[Guest 1]: to his head just for that reason and again

06:16:12.960 --> 06:16:14.960
[Guest 2]: it's that but again it's a very clear bias

06:16:14.960 --> 06:16:16.960
[Guest 2]: I know for a fact that one day when I meet somebody

06:16:16.960 --> 06:16:18.960
[Unknown]: who says that hey this idea is

06:16:18.960 --> 06:16:20.960
[Guest 2]: amazing, I am going to put 2 crores

06:16:20.960 --> 06:16:22.960
[Guest 2]: let's do 4 concerts, everybody will come together

06:16:22.960 --> 06:16:24.960
[Guest 2]: but that core fund

06:16:24.960 --> 06:16:26.960
[Guest 2]: and honestly I have

06:16:26.960 --> 06:16:28.960
[Guest 2]: also not taken effort because it takes a lot of

06:16:28.960 --> 06:16:30.960
[Amit Varma]: effort. I think you know

06:16:30.960 --> 06:16:32.960
[Amit Varma]: Varun Grover in his episode with

06:16:32.960 --> 06:16:34.960
[Amit Varma]: me had given this great quote about

06:16:34.960 --> 06:16:36.960
[Amit Varma]: which he heard from somewhere

06:16:36.960 --> 06:16:38.960
[Amit Varma]: I love the writing but I don't like the paperwork

06:16:38.960 --> 06:16:40.960
[Amit Varma]: so I think you know you and I

06:16:40.960 --> 06:16:42.960
[Amit Varma]: are kind of in that same boat

06:16:42.960 --> 06:16:44.960
[Amit Varma]: our man Roshan here has done the writing

06:16:44.960 --> 06:16:46.960
[Guest 2]: done the paperwork. That's why he has more paperwork

06:16:46.960 --> 06:16:48.960
[Unknown]: that's why he has

06:16:48.960 --> 06:16:50.960
[Unknown]: more paperwork also

06:16:50.960 --> 06:16:52.960
[Amit Varma]: yeah cream paper

06:16:52.960 --> 06:16:54.960
[Unknown]: wow wow

06:16:54.960 --> 06:16:56.960
[Amit Varma]: so

06:16:56.960 --> 06:16:58.960
[Amit Varma]: Roshan you know

06:16:58.960 --> 06:17:00.960
[Amit Varma]: besides your extreme productivity

06:17:00.960 --> 06:17:02.960
[Amit Varma]: the other thing which I am very

06:17:02.960 --> 06:17:04.960
[Amit Varma]: impressed by and something

06:17:04.960 --> 06:17:06.960
[Amit Varma]: we can all learn from is how

06:17:06.960 --> 06:17:08.960
[Amit Varma]: it's a hunger for new experiences

06:17:08.960 --> 06:17:10.960
[Amit Varma]: so tell me a little bit about

06:17:10.960 --> 06:17:12.960
[Amit Varma]: you know how

06:17:12.960 --> 06:17:14.960
[Amit Varma]: you know Monsoon Wedding came

06:17:14.960 --> 06:17:16.960
[Amit Varma]: about, Meera Nair

06:17:16.960 --> 06:17:18.960
[Amit Varma]: directed musical which is going to Broadway now

06:17:18.960 --> 06:17:20.960
[Amit Varma]: you know how that came about, what was

06:17:20.960 --> 06:17:22.960
[Amit Varma]: your reaction, what was the

06:17:22.960 --> 06:17:24.960
[Guest 2]: experience like, what were your learnings

06:17:24.960 --> 06:17:26.960
[Guest 1]: just hungry

06:17:26.960 --> 06:17:28.960
[Guest 1]: absolutely true

06:17:28.960 --> 06:17:30.960
[Guest 1]: you know

06:17:30.960 --> 06:17:32.960
[Guest 1]: that need

06:17:32.960 --> 06:17:34.960
[Guest 1]: that creative curiosity

06:17:34.960 --> 06:17:36.960
[Guest 1]: this festival which you are

06:17:36.960 --> 06:17:38.960
[Guest 1]: already a part of as I mentioned to you

06:17:38.960 --> 06:17:40.960
[Guest 1]: Stumble

06:17:40.960 --> 06:17:42.960
[Guest 1]: we are doing this next year in fact but the idea

06:17:42.960 --> 06:17:44.960
[Guest 1]: was it's a festival of creative curiosity

06:17:44.960 --> 06:17:46.960
[Guest 1]: and everybody said you know what 2-3 people

06:17:46.960 --> 06:17:48.960
[Guest 1]: who worked with me said

06:17:48.960 --> 06:17:50.960
[Guest 1]: whatever you have to do at home, you expand it

06:17:50.960 --> 06:17:52.960
[Guest 1]: and make it a festival

06:17:52.960 --> 06:17:54.960
[Guest 1]: but this need

06:17:54.960 --> 06:17:56.960
[Guest 1]: to satisfy curiosity

06:17:56.960 --> 06:17:58.960
[Guest 1]: to a large degree and

06:17:58.960 --> 06:18:00.960
[Guest 1]: creatively because you know

06:18:00.960 --> 06:18:02.960
[Guest 1]: when you make a little bit of money you get

06:18:02.960 --> 06:18:04.960
[Guest 1]: approached by so many of these funds and everybody

06:18:04.960 --> 06:18:06.960
[Guest 1]: who comes and says sir

06:18:06.960 --> 06:18:08.960
[Guest 1]: I will make it 100

06:18:08.960 --> 06:18:10.960
[Guest 1]: I say sir you can't give me a return

06:18:10.960 --> 06:18:12.960
[Guest 1]: which my brain gives

06:18:12.960 --> 06:18:14.960
[Guest 1]: my brain makes 0 into 100

06:18:14.960 --> 06:18:16.960
[Guest 1]: so you can never get that multiplier

06:18:16.960 --> 06:18:18.960
[Guest 1]: right, where does that multiplier come from

06:18:18.960 --> 06:18:20.960
[Guest 1]: that multiplier comes only when

06:18:20.960 --> 06:18:22.960
[Guest 1]: you go out and

06:18:22.960 --> 06:18:24.960
[Guest 1]: find new things to do

06:18:24.960 --> 06:18:26.960
[Guest 1]: now I am a child when it comes

06:18:26.960 --> 06:18:28.960
[Guest 1]: to learning and I have childlike enthusiasm

06:18:28.960 --> 06:18:30.960
[Guest 1]: about these things so

06:18:30.960 --> 06:18:32.960
[Guest 1]: this year it had started

06:18:32.960 --> 06:18:34.960
[Guest 1]: with me after Dubai when we

06:18:34.960 --> 06:18:36.960
[Guest 1]: did one or two concerts and actually I spent

06:18:36.960 --> 06:18:38.960
[Guest 1]: a lot of time with Veer and Veer

06:18:38.960 --> 06:18:40.960
[Guest 1]: has a lot to do so the day we were doing the

06:18:40.960 --> 06:18:42.960
[Guest 1]: Veer Das event the first day

06:18:42.960 --> 06:18:44.960
[Guest 1]: unfortunately his excellency

06:18:44.960 --> 06:18:46.960
[Guest 1]: the head of Abu Dhabi passed away

06:18:46.960 --> 06:18:48.960
[Guest 1]: and they in the day it happened

06:18:48.960 --> 06:18:50.960
[Guest 1]: and by the evening they said no shows will happen

06:18:50.960 --> 06:18:52.960
[Guest 1]: and we had already said we won't do an event

06:18:52.960 --> 06:18:54.960
[Guest 1]: so Veer came home and we were talking

06:18:54.960 --> 06:18:56.960
[Guest 1]: and then in conversation he was telling about the television show

06:18:56.960 --> 06:18:58.960
[Guest 1]: he is making and about his New York special

06:18:58.960 --> 06:19:00.960
[Guest 1]: and I mean the most amazing story about Chris Rock

06:19:00.960 --> 06:19:02.960
[Guest 1]: where he went to the Comedy Central

06:19:02.960 --> 06:19:04.960
[Guest 1]: performance place in New York and he said you know

06:19:04.960 --> 06:19:06.960
[Guest 1]: I was there and I was going to perform

06:19:06.960 --> 06:19:08.960
[Guest 1]: and they had about 5 performers with

06:19:08.960 --> 06:19:10.960
[Guest 1]: 5-10 minute slots

06:19:10.960 --> 06:19:12.960
[Guest 1]: and they said you got a surprise act

06:19:12.960 --> 06:19:14.960
[Guest 1]: for the rest of the evening

06:19:14.960 --> 06:19:16.960
[Guest 1]: and suddenly they came and said guys we are knocking

06:19:16.960 --> 06:19:18.960
[Guest 1]: off all the acts before

06:19:18.960 --> 06:19:20.960
[Guest 1]: because Chris Rock is performing and he is going to come

06:19:20.960 --> 06:19:22.960
[Guest 1]: and Chris Rock is legend in life

06:19:22.960 --> 06:19:24.960
[Guest 1]: he said ultimately

06:19:24.960 --> 06:19:26.960
[Guest 1]: I went and I was like you know

06:19:26.960 --> 06:19:28.960
[Guest 1]: they said will you just

06:19:28.960 --> 06:19:30.960
[Guest 1]: introduce Chris Rock so he went and he did

06:19:30.960 --> 06:19:32.960
[Guest 1]: the 5 minute set before Chris Rock

06:19:32.960 --> 06:19:34.960
[Guest 1]: and then when it finished they said will you also close

06:19:34.960 --> 06:19:36.960
[Guest 1]: so he went and did it

06:19:36.960 --> 06:19:38.960
[Guest 1]: so he said you know

06:19:38.960 --> 06:19:40.960
[Guest 1]: I closed for Chris Rock

06:19:40.960 --> 06:19:42.960
[Guest 1]: so his wife was sitting there and he said no

06:19:42.960 --> 06:19:44.960
[Guest 1]: he opened for you

06:19:44.960 --> 06:19:46.960
[Guest 1]: and I love

06:19:46.960 --> 06:19:48.960
[Guest 1]: Veer's the same thing about Veer

06:19:48.960 --> 06:19:50.960
[Guest 1]: his bias for action and his ability to keep doing new things

06:19:50.960 --> 06:19:52.960
[Guest 1]: so while talking like this he said

06:19:52.960 --> 06:19:54.960
[Guest 1]: Edinburgh Fringe is happening, let's go

06:19:54.960 --> 06:19:56.960
[Guest 1]: and I have always wanted to go to the Fringe

06:19:56.960 --> 06:19:58.960
[Guest 1]: and every year I have had this thing because August used to be work time

06:19:58.960 --> 06:20:00.960
[Guest 1]: and kids used to come back from vacation

06:20:00.960 --> 06:20:02.960
[Guest 1]: so I said I am going to go for a fact

06:20:02.960 --> 06:20:04.960
[Guest 1]: and I went for 10 days

06:20:04.960 --> 06:20:06.960
[Guest 1]: when I was there I saw

06:20:06.960 --> 06:20:08.960
[Guest 1]: so much experimental theatre

06:20:08.960 --> 06:20:10.960
[Guest 1]: I saw 21 shows in 7 days

06:20:10.960 --> 06:20:12.960
[Guest 1]: I had a backpack

06:20:12.960 --> 06:20:14.960
[Guest 1]: I used to get up at breakfast and go

06:20:14.960 --> 06:20:16.960
[Guest 1]: you can't pre book

06:20:16.960 --> 06:20:18.960
[Guest 1]: and I stood in lines for 2-2 hours

06:20:18.960 --> 06:20:20.960
[Guest 1]: humbling experience, you are meeting

06:20:20.960 --> 06:20:22.960
[Guest 1]: waiters who are trying stand up comedy

06:20:22.960 --> 06:20:24.960
[Guest 1]: from New York who have flown down to do their experimental set

06:20:24.960 --> 06:20:26.960
[Guest 1]: a girl who is 19

06:20:26.960 --> 06:20:28.960
[Guest 1]: who has written her first play and been called

06:20:28.960 --> 06:20:30.960
[Guest 1]: somebody who has been their thespian for 30 years

06:20:30.960 --> 06:20:32.960
[Guest 1]: standing on the road and distributing his tickets

06:20:32.960 --> 06:20:34.960
[Guest 1]: it is for any creator

06:20:34.960 --> 06:20:36.960
[Guest 1]: you have to go to a Fringe

06:20:36.960 --> 06:20:38.960
[Guest 1]: just to experience this madness

06:20:38.960 --> 06:20:40.960
[Guest 1]: of a city coming alive with the arts

06:20:40.960 --> 06:20:42.960
[Guest 1]: I think somewhere there in my head

06:20:42.960 --> 06:20:44.960
[Guest 1]: this wanting to get back to theatre

06:20:44.960 --> 06:20:46.960
[Guest 1]: became a big urge

06:20:46.960 --> 06:20:48.960
[Guest 1]: but not any play because I have been

06:20:48.960 --> 06:20:50.960
[Guest 1]: offered a lot of plays to do here in Bombay

06:20:50.960 --> 06:20:52.960
[Guest 1]: but I was like whatever I had to do here

06:20:52.960 --> 06:20:54.960
[Guest 1]: I did it because honestly after doing Aladin

06:20:54.960 --> 06:20:56.960
[Guest 1]: and a lot of other things

06:20:56.960 --> 06:20:58.960
[Guest 1]: I was like what will I do after this

06:20:58.960 --> 06:21:00.960
[Guest 1]: I did Prithvi, I did single play

06:21:00.960 --> 06:21:02.960
[Guest 1]: I did Aladin, I wrote

06:21:02.960 --> 06:21:04.960
[Guest 1]: and suddenly this call happened

06:21:04.960 --> 06:21:06.960
[Guest 1]: from Dilip Shankar and he said Roshan

06:21:06.960 --> 06:21:08.960
[Guest 1]: they are looking for somebody to do this

06:21:08.960 --> 06:21:10.960
[Guest 1]: and I called Amol who sort of manages

06:21:10.960 --> 06:21:12.960
[Guest 1]: my work at Commune and many other artists

06:21:12.960 --> 06:21:14.960
[Guest 1]: and he was like sir

06:21:14.960 --> 06:21:16.960
[Guest 1]: three months

06:21:16.960 --> 06:21:18.960
[Guest 1]: and that is when the first big thing was

06:21:18.960 --> 06:21:20.960
[Guest 1]: three months, two months

06:21:20.960 --> 06:21:22.960
[Guest 1]: in Bombay and this was premiering

06:21:22.960 --> 06:21:24.960
[Guest 1]: at the World Cup at Doha because it was

06:21:24.960 --> 06:21:26.960
[Guest 1]: part of the Qatar Creates thing

06:21:26.960 --> 06:21:28.960
[Guest 1]: and then we were told that next year

06:21:28.960 --> 06:21:30.960
[Guest 1]: which is in April, May

06:21:30.960 --> 06:21:32.960
[Guest 1]: it will go off Broadway which is the process

06:21:32.960 --> 06:21:34.960
[Guest 1]: you go off Broadway then producers come

06:21:34.960 --> 06:21:36.960
[Guest 1]: then if they selected then it goes on Broadway

06:21:36.960 --> 06:21:38.960
[Guest 1]: then there will be an India tour and a global tour

06:21:38.960 --> 06:21:40.960
[Guest 1]: and the way Meera has lived with this story

06:21:40.960 --> 06:21:42.960
[Guest 1]: ever since the film was made and the play

06:21:42.960 --> 06:21:44.960
[Guest 1]: has happened twice before but in smaller

06:21:44.960 --> 06:21:46.960
[Guest 1]: avatars, so Berklee they did a show

06:21:46.960 --> 06:21:48.960
[Guest 1]: where Javed Jafri played Lalit

06:21:48.960 --> 06:21:50.960
[Guest 1]: and Javed is a very good dancer

06:21:50.960 --> 06:21:52.960
[Guest 1]: but you know sings

06:21:52.960 --> 06:21:54.960
[Guest 1]: and is also

06:21:54.960 --> 06:21:56.960
[Guest 1]: so he was there

06:21:56.960 --> 06:21:58.960
[Guest 1]: and Namit was there from that show only

06:21:58.960 --> 06:22:00.960
[Guest 1]: and Sharwari was there and many other actors

06:22:00.960 --> 06:22:02.960
[Guest 1]: I think at that point in time Ali Sethi

06:22:02.960 --> 06:22:04.960
[Guest 1]: was being considered for something

06:22:04.960 --> 06:22:06.960
[Guest 1]: as a role and beautiful

06:22:06.960 --> 06:22:08.960
[Guest 1]: so they did shows there

06:22:08.960 --> 06:22:10.960
[Guest 1]: for 6 weeks, it was a housefull

06:22:10.960 --> 06:22:12.960
[Guest 1]: show that I had heard of

06:22:12.960 --> 06:22:14.960
[Guest 1]: the script was still evolving then in 2019

06:22:14.960 --> 06:22:16.960
[Guest 1]: they did Delhi, they did 12 shows

06:22:16.960 --> 06:22:18.960
[Guest 1]: again completely new and with

06:22:18.960 --> 06:22:20.960
[Guest 1]: theatre, unless you are in

06:22:20.960 --> 06:22:22.960
[Guest 1]: a resident theatre space the play

06:22:22.960 --> 06:22:24.960
[Guest 1]: changes to adapt to the place

06:22:24.960 --> 06:22:26.960
[Guest 1]: and Qatar was going to be a revolving

06:22:26.960 --> 06:22:28.960
[Guest 1]: stage, LED screens

06:22:28.960 --> 06:22:30.960
[Guest 1]: it was Meera's biggest vision

06:22:30.960 --> 06:22:32.960
[Guest 1]: and therefore the fact of being part

06:22:32.960 --> 06:22:34.960
[Guest 1]: of that vision, being part of a film

06:22:34.960 --> 06:22:36.960
[Guest 1]: that I had loved to watch

06:22:36.960 --> 06:22:38.960
[Guest 1]: and experiencing the

06:22:38.960 --> 06:22:40.960
[Guest 1]: triple threat, as I said acting

06:22:40.960 --> 06:22:42.960
[Guest 1]: singing, I could do that, I had to do dance as well

06:22:42.960 --> 06:22:44.960
[Guest 1]: and it was clearly told

06:22:44.960 --> 06:22:46.960
[Guest 1]: and I was also told by

06:22:46.960 --> 06:22:48.960
[Guest 1]: you know

06:22:48.960 --> 06:22:50.960
[Guest 1]: Meera's partner, he came

06:22:50.960 --> 06:22:52.960
[Guest 1]: and he said that Roshan, we are treating

06:22:52.960 --> 06:22:54.960
[Guest 1]: this as an ensemble cast which means that

06:22:54.960 --> 06:22:56.960
[Guest 1]: while you might be playing a very significant

06:22:56.960 --> 06:22:58.960
[Guest 1]: role, there will be other scenes where you might

06:22:58.960 --> 06:23:00.960
[Guest 1]: be playing a PM and walking on with a

06:23:00.960 --> 06:23:02.960
[Guest 1]: suitcase and whatever, are you comfortable with that

06:23:02.960 --> 06:23:04.960
[Guest 1]: I said I don't have anything like that

06:23:04.960 --> 06:23:06.960
[Guest 1]: so I said I don't mind, let me

06:23:06.960 --> 06:23:08.960
[Guest 1]: see if I fit in, so I did

06:23:08.960 --> 06:23:10.960
[Guest 1]: the audition, I was by myself

06:23:10.960 --> 06:23:12.960
[Guest 1]: in Dubai, there was no one there, I called my friend

06:23:12.960 --> 06:23:14.960
[Guest 1]: who used to act with me in theatre 25 years ago

06:23:14.960 --> 06:23:16.960
[Guest 1]: in Lucknow, who came, we did

06:23:16.960 --> 06:23:18.960
[Guest 1]: a printout of the script, he sat opposite

06:23:18.960 --> 06:23:20.960
[Guest 1]: and read the lines, I did

06:23:20.960 --> 06:23:22.960
[Guest 1]: a decent audition, then with the songs

06:23:22.960 --> 06:23:24.960
[Guest 1]: I had to sing, I took 2-3 extra days

06:23:24.960 --> 06:23:26.960
[Guest 1]: learned the songs, my daughter

06:23:26.960 --> 06:23:28.960
[Guest 1]: reviewed them online and passed them

06:23:28.960 --> 06:23:30.960
[Guest 1]: saying ya it's decent, and I did

06:23:30.960 --> 06:23:32.960
[Guest 1]: that, and that's

06:23:32.960 --> 06:23:34.960
[Guest 1]: when I, there was a song

06:23:34.960 --> 06:23:36.960
[Guest 1]: which is towards the end

06:23:36.960 --> 06:23:38.960
[Guest 1]: I'll just tell you, so it has

06:23:38.960 --> 06:23:40.960
[Guest 1]: the original line

06:23:40.960 --> 06:23:42.960
[Unknown]: Riya you must come home

06:23:42.960 --> 06:23:44.960
[Unknown]: again

06:23:44.960 --> 06:23:46.960
[Unknown]: Riya

06:23:46.960 --> 06:23:48.960
[Unknown]: my child, my

06:23:48.960 --> 06:23:50.960
[Unknown]: life, my own

06:23:52.960 --> 06:23:54.960
[Unknown]: please come home

06:23:54.960 --> 06:23:56.960
[Guest 1]: again

06:23:56.960 --> 06:23:58.960
[Guest 1]: so when I heard it for the first time

06:23:58.960 --> 06:24:00.960
[Guest 1]: the scale for me

06:24:00.960 --> 06:24:02.960
[Guest 1]: this is not my scale

06:24:02.960 --> 06:24:04.960
[Guest 1]: so this

06:24:04.960 --> 06:24:06.960
[Guest 1]: is based on Des

06:24:06.960 --> 06:24:08.960
[Unknown]: this world

06:24:08.960 --> 06:24:10.960
[Unknown]: may be touched

06:24:10.960 --> 06:24:12.960
[Unknown]: this world may be touched

06:24:12.960 --> 06:24:14.960
[Unknown]: may there be love

06:24:14.960 --> 06:24:16.960
[Unknown]: may I

06:24:16.960 --> 06:24:18.960
[Unknown]: live or not

06:24:18.960 --> 06:24:20.960
[Guest 1]: Sajda

06:24:20.960 --> 06:24:22.960
[Guest 1]: continue

06:24:22.960 --> 06:24:24.960
[Guest 1]: so when the first time I heard this

06:24:24.960 --> 06:24:26.960
[Guest 1]: I was shocked

06:24:26.960 --> 06:24:28.960
[Guest 1]: still I think I'm singing

06:24:28.960 --> 06:24:30.960
[Guest 1]: half note lower than the other thing

06:24:30.960 --> 06:24:32.960
[Guest 1]: and Vishal Bhardwaj's music

06:24:32.960 --> 06:24:34.960
[Guest 1]: a lot of other songs

06:24:34.960 --> 06:24:36.960
[Guest 1]: the opening song, all the other

06:24:36.960 --> 06:24:38.960
[Guest 1]: songs that I had, ensemble songs

06:24:38.960 --> 06:24:40.960
[Guest 1]: were beautiful

06:24:40.960 --> 06:24:42.960
[Guest 1]: so when I committed to it, I realized

06:24:42.960 --> 06:24:44.960
[Guest 1]: that I'm doing this with love of theatre, it was

06:24:44.960 --> 06:24:46.960
[Guest 1]: paying, but theatre pays you, theatre money

06:24:46.960 --> 06:24:48.960
[Guest 1]: and there is a beautiful line that I read

06:24:48.960 --> 06:24:50.960
[Guest 1]: in a broadway article, because after this I researched

06:24:50.960 --> 06:24:52.960
[Guest 1]: broadway first

06:24:52.960 --> 06:24:54.960
[Guest 1]: how much does it cost, how much does it cost, what does it cost

06:24:54.960 --> 06:24:56.960
[Guest 1]: so it was very clear that in broadway

06:24:56.960 --> 06:24:58.960
[Guest 1]: you can't make a living, you can make a killing

06:24:58.960 --> 06:25:00.960
[Guest 1]: so see a Lion King

06:25:00.960 --> 06:25:02.960
[Guest 1]: makes 1.8 billion dollars

06:25:02.960 --> 06:25:04.960
[Guest 1]: yeah, a top notch

06:25:04.960 --> 06:25:06.960
[Guest 1]: actor once he gets billing

06:25:06.960 --> 06:25:08.960
[Guest 1]: Tony and whatever etc, can be earning

06:25:08.960 --> 06:25:10.960
[Guest 1]: a great sum of money

06:25:10.960 --> 06:25:12.960
[Guest 1]: or whatever, but

06:25:12.960 --> 06:25:14.960
[Guest 1]: in India, you know sometimes people who work

06:25:14.960 --> 06:25:16.960
[Guest 1]: at Prithvi get a thousand rupees a show

06:25:16.960 --> 06:25:18.960
[Guest 1]: so there is no comparison

06:25:18.960 --> 06:25:20.960
[Guest 1]: so I first told Amol Singh

06:25:20.960 --> 06:25:22.960
[Guest 1]: I'm comfortable with this, as long as I can get

06:25:22.960 --> 06:25:24.960
[Guest 1]: four days off to do my regular

06:25:24.960 --> 06:25:26.960
[Guest 1]: event work, because I still

06:25:26.960 --> 06:25:28.960
[Guest 1]: thankfully as a live event host get paid well

06:25:28.960 --> 06:25:30.960
[Guest 1]: and I made sure that I get enough of these shows

06:25:30.960 --> 06:25:32.960
[Guest 1]: so this money thing

06:25:32.960 --> 06:25:34.960
[Guest 1]: you know I don't like living off interest, I like to live

06:25:34.960 --> 06:25:36.960
[Guest 1]: off my current earning, so that

06:25:36.960 --> 06:25:38.960
[Guest 1]: was something which we took care of, they were very accommodating

06:25:38.960 --> 06:25:40.960
[Guest 1]: they gave me the dates

06:25:40.960 --> 06:25:42.960
[Guest 1]: we started doing rehearsals

06:25:42.960 --> 06:25:44.960
[Guest 1]: at Rang Mandir

06:25:44.960 --> 06:25:46.960
[Guest 1]: in Bandra, for a month we

06:25:46.960 --> 06:25:48.960
[Guest 1]: rehearsed there, and suddenly we had everyone

06:25:48.960 --> 06:25:50.960
[Guest 1]: from Emily Whitaker

06:25:50.960 --> 06:25:52.960
[Guest 1]: our music director, Carrie Ann

06:25:52.960 --> 06:25:54.960
[Guest 1]: who is actually the movement director

06:25:54.960 --> 06:25:56.960
[Guest 1]: and the choreographer for Six

06:25:56.960 --> 06:25:58.960
[Guest 1]: which is a Tony nominated play

06:25:58.960 --> 06:26:00.960
[Guest 1]: and has won a couple of Tonys as well

06:26:00.960 --> 06:26:02.960
[Guest 1]: plus there was Shampa

06:26:02.960 --> 06:26:04.960
[Guest 1]: Gopi Krishna who was the other director, who was the other

06:26:04.960 --> 06:26:06.960
[Guest 1]: choreographer, brilliant

06:26:06.960 --> 06:26:08.960
[Guest 1]: brilliant set of musicians who were working with us

06:26:08.960 --> 06:26:10.960
[Guest 1]: on a daily basis, and the cast

06:26:10.960 --> 06:26:12.960
[Guest 1]: I mean frankly, I have never worked

06:26:12.960 --> 06:26:14.960
[Guest 1]: with a more eclectic

06:26:14.960 --> 06:26:16.960
[Guest 1]: set of people, more talented

06:26:16.960 --> 06:26:18.960
[Guest 1]: and more giving

06:26:18.960 --> 06:26:20.960
[Guest 1]: because you know, I have done plays

06:26:20.960 --> 06:26:22.960
[Guest 1]: before where there will be 2-3

06:26:22.960 --> 06:26:24.960
[Guest 1]: bad ones, and then

06:26:24.960 --> 06:26:26.960
[Guest 1]: you know that he has an ego, he will fight

06:26:26.960 --> 06:26:28.960
[Guest 1]: he will argue, he will have a temper tantrum

06:26:28.960 --> 06:26:30.960
[Guest 1]: he will be late, etc

06:26:30.960 --> 06:26:32.960
[Guest 1]: but here

06:26:32.960 --> 06:26:34.960
[Guest 1]: everyone, I mean small things

06:26:34.960 --> 06:26:36.960
[Guest 1]: keep happening, but nothing to that

06:26:36.960 --> 06:26:38.960
[Amit Varma]: degree, there is a saying in poker

06:26:38.960 --> 06:26:40.960
[Amit Varma]: if you don't know who is the fish

06:26:40.960 --> 06:26:42.960
[Unknown]: at the table, it's you

06:26:42.960 --> 06:26:44.960
[Unknown]: so I think, if you don't know who is the bad one

06:26:44.960 --> 06:26:46.960
[Unknown]: this Roshan,

06:26:46.960 --> 06:26:48.960
[Unknown]: you are missing one

06:26:48.960 --> 06:26:50.960
[Guest 1]: but you must hear this

06:26:50.960 --> 06:26:52.960
[Amit Varma]: these are the two beautiful stories that happened

06:26:52.960 --> 06:26:54.960
[Guest 1]: so after about 10-15

06:26:54.960 --> 06:26:56.960
[Guest 1]: days, and Namit was playing PK Dubey

06:26:56.960 --> 06:26:58.960
[Guest 1]: which was a beautiful role by Vijay Raaz

06:26:58.960 --> 06:27:00.960
[Guest 1]: I am playing Naseer Saab's role or whatever

06:27:00.960 --> 06:27:02.960
[Guest 1]: Charu Shankar was playing my wife, brilliant actress

06:27:02.960 --> 06:27:04.960
[Guest 1]: from Delhi, person I knew before

06:27:04.960 --> 06:27:06.960
[Guest 1]: as well also, because you know we worked on

06:27:06.960 --> 06:27:08.960
[Guest 1]: one or two other projects, small small projects earlier

06:27:08.960 --> 06:27:10.960
[Guest 1]: but Lilayat Ji's role

06:27:10.960 --> 06:27:12.960
[Guest 1]: is there, Sharwari was playing

06:27:12.960 --> 06:27:14.960
[Guest 1]: Shifali Shah's role, I mean

06:27:14.960 --> 06:27:16.960
[Guest 1]: and honestly everybody, Kulbhushan Khaminda's role

06:27:16.960 --> 06:27:18.960
[Guest 1]: Sagar Deshmukh, fabulous cast

06:27:18.960 --> 06:27:20.960
[Guest 1]: sorry, Edwin Joseph

06:27:20.960 --> 06:27:22.960
[Guest 1]: playing the love interest and Mansi Multani

06:27:22.960 --> 06:27:24.960
[Guest 1]: playing the daughter Aditi

06:27:24.960 --> 06:27:26.960
[Guest 1]: again, like I can't, I can go on

06:27:26.960 --> 06:27:28.960
[Guest 1]: and on about each of these people, each of these people

06:27:28.960 --> 06:27:30.960
[Guest 1]: Piya Behroopiya world tour, so and so

06:27:30.960 --> 06:27:32.960
[Guest 1]: Yeh, Broadway, Beauty

06:27:32.960 --> 06:27:34.960
[Guest 1]: and the Beast lead, these are all people

06:27:34.960 --> 06:27:36.960
[Guest 1]: among them Roshan Ambar

06:27:36.960 --> 06:27:38.960
[Guest 1]: so A,

06:27:38.960 --> 06:27:40.960
[Guest 1]: this whole thing of saying, let's learn

06:27:40.960 --> 06:27:42.960
[Guest 1]: was a great thing

06:27:42.960 --> 06:27:44.960
[Guest 1]: My one habit

06:27:44.960 --> 06:27:46.960
[Guest 1]: a lot of people, I like it

06:27:46.960 --> 06:27:48.960
[Guest 1]: sometimes some people don't like it

06:27:48.960 --> 06:27:50.960
[Guest 1]: I, I, I make everyone

06:27:50.960 --> 06:27:52.960
[Guest 1]: like a family, so I am very empathetic

06:27:52.960 --> 06:27:54.960
[Guest 1]: or whatever, so if anyone needs anything

06:27:54.960 --> 06:27:56.960
[Guest 1]: I will tell them, it comes from here, it happens

06:27:56.960 --> 06:27:58.960
[Guest 1]: so, before Dua

06:27:58.960 --> 06:28:00.960
[Guest 1]: one day, Naveed was sitting with us at lunch, he says

06:28:00.960 --> 06:28:02.960
[Unknown]: Roshan Bhai,

06:28:02.960 --> 06:28:04.960
[Unknown]: you tell me, your

06:28:04.960 --> 06:28:06.960
[Unknown]: deep, dark, hidden

06:28:06.960 --> 06:28:08.960
[Unknown]: which bad habit do you have?

06:28:08.960 --> 06:28:10.960
[Unknown]: I mean, there must be something

06:28:10.960 --> 06:28:12.960
[Unknown]: he says, look

06:28:12.960 --> 06:28:14.960
[Guest 1]: there can't be such a good person

06:28:14.960 --> 06:28:16.960
[Guest 1]: Arjun Bhai, what should I say

06:28:16.960 --> 06:28:18.960
[Guest 1]: I am really like this

06:28:18.960 --> 06:28:20.960
[Guest 1]: No, no, Roshan Bhai, I don't believe it

06:28:20.960 --> 06:28:22.960
[Guest 1]: that whole day they all went after me

06:28:22.960 --> 06:28:24.960
[Guest 1]: what is your habit or whatever

06:28:24.960 --> 06:28:26.960
[Guest 1]: you will have to ask Shaheen Waheen

06:28:26.960 --> 06:28:28.960
[Unknown]: Shaheen Waheen

06:28:28.960 --> 06:28:30.960
[Unknown]: who is this Waheen?

06:28:30.960 --> 06:28:32.960
[Guest 1]: this Waheen is

06:28:32.960 --> 06:28:34.960
[Guest 2]: my parents, my loved ones

06:28:34.960 --> 06:28:36.960
[Guest 1]: don't say too much, this Waheen's Waheen

06:28:36.960 --> 06:28:38.960
[Guest 1]: this happened

06:28:38.960 --> 06:28:40.960
[Guest 1]: after this we did

06:28:40.960 --> 06:28:42.960
[Guest 1]: rehearsals here, I managed to get my parents

06:28:42.960 --> 06:28:44.960
[Guest 1]: here to come for the dress rehearsal

06:28:44.960 --> 06:28:46.960
[Guest 1]: which happened at Andrews, Vishalji attended

06:28:46.960 --> 06:28:48.960
[Guest 1]: that show, Nasreen Muni Kabir

06:28:48.960 --> 06:28:50.960
[Guest 1]: came for it, many other, everybody

06:28:50.960 --> 06:28:52.960
[Guest 1]: was allowed to invite 2-3 people, so my parents flew

06:28:52.960 --> 06:28:54.960
[Guest 1]: Shaheen had an exhibition in Dubai

06:28:54.960 --> 06:28:56.960
[Guest 1]: so she said she will come to Doha, my parents flew

06:28:56.960 --> 06:28:58.960
[Guest 1]: in from Lucknow, so for me the fact

06:28:58.960 --> 06:29:00.960
[Guest 1]: that my parents, my dad in 82

06:29:00.960 --> 06:29:02.960
[Guest 1]: took a flight with my mom and came

06:29:02.960 --> 06:29:04.960
[Guest 1]: was itself the biggest achievement

06:29:04.960 --> 06:29:06.960
[Guest 1]: and the performance

06:29:06.960 --> 06:29:08.960
[Guest 1]: really went off well

06:29:08.960 --> 06:29:10.960
[Guest 1]: because by this time it had become muscle memory

06:29:10.960 --> 06:29:12.960
[Guest 1]: and in theatre, it needs to become

06:29:12.960 --> 06:29:14.960
[Guest 1]: muscle memory for you to then

06:29:14.960 --> 06:29:16.960
[Guest 1]: start playing

06:29:16.960 --> 06:29:18.960
[Guest 1]: you know, you have to go from point A to point B

06:29:18.960 --> 06:29:20.960
[Guest 1]: how you have to go

06:29:20.960 --> 06:29:22.960
[Guest 1]: and it's the only medium

06:29:22.960 --> 06:29:24.960
[Guest 1]: so in fact one day when Meera was directing

06:29:24.960 --> 06:29:26.960
[Guest 1]: when one actor came and said that

06:29:26.960 --> 06:29:28.960
[Guest 1]: there is so much direction right now and whatever

06:29:28.960 --> 06:29:30.960
[Guest 1]: we will see in the play, so he was joking

06:29:30.960 --> 06:29:32.960
[Guest 1]: the girl turned and said

06:29:32.960 --> 06:29:34.960
[Guest 1]: ultimately theatre is the only

06:29:34.960 --> 06:29:36.960
[Guest 1]: medium where the actor has control

06:29:36.960 --> 06:29:38.960
[Guest 1]: because nobody stops you right

06:29:38.960 --> 06:29:40.960
[Guest 1]: they can't stop the scene and say retake it again

06:29:40.960 --> 06:29:42.960
[Guest 1]: no, it's you, and I said

06:29:42.960 --> 06:29:44.960
[Guest 1]: I never thought of this

06:29:44.960 --> 06:29:46.960
[Guest 1]: so I know I have to go from here to there

06:29:46.960 --> 06:29:48.960
[Guest 1]: but how do I do it, what

06:29:48.960 --> 06:29:50.960
[Guest 1]: craft can I use in it

06:29:50.960 --> 06:29:52.960
[Guest 1]: how aware am I of my body, how am I

06:29:52.960 --> 06:29:54.960
[Guest 1]: standing, where am I looking

06:29:54.960 --> 06:29:56.960
[Guest 1]: and you know I swear to you, I have never

06:29:56.960 --> 06:29:58.960
[Guest 1]: enjoyed the craft as much as this

06:29:58.960 --> 06:30:00.960
[Guest 1]: because I

06:30:00.960 --> 06:30:02.960
[Guest 1]: did so many things with it

06:30:02.960 --> 06:30:04.960
[Guest 1]: like there is a scene

06:30:04.960 --> 06:30:06.960
[Guest 1]: in which I am running after Rhea when she is leaving

06:30:06.960 --> 06:30:08.960
[Guest 1]: the house and it's a very

06:30:08.960 --> 06:30:10.960
[Guest 1]: it's just a very pillared kind of

06:30:10.960 --> 06:30:12.960
[Guest 1]: metallic structure, there was a light below

06:30:12.960 --> 06:30:14.960
[Guest 1]: now what I started doing

06:30:14.960 --> 06:30:16.960
[Guest 1]: I started going and stopping at the light

06:30:16.960 --> 06:30:18.960
[Guest 1]: and after that

06:30:18.960 --> 06:30:20.960
[Guest 1]: this light used to be on, so there is a man

06:30:20.960 --> 06:30:22.960
[Guest 1]: standing in the dark, a light is on on Sunday

06:30:22.960 --> 06:30:24.960
[Guest 1]: and in that I turn, so you can see

06:30:24.960 --> 06:30:26.960
[Guest 1]: my half lit face, now see I have imagined

06:30:26.960 --> 06:30:28.960
[Guest 1]: this and I have told someone, see this is happening

06:30:28.960 --> 06:30:30.960
[Guest 1]: another person, now this is where

06:30:30.960 --> 06:30:32.960
[Guest 1]: you are playing with the thing, I have to

06:30:32.960 --> 06:30:34.960
[Guest 1]: go and tell Rhea

06:30:34.960 --> 06:30:36.960
[Guest 1]: please come, Rhea Rhea please

06:30:36.960 --> 06:30:38.960
[Guest 1]: and then I turn slowly as the music moves

06:30:38.960 --> 06:30:40.960
[Guest 1]: that is where you enjoy the craft

06:30:40.960 --> 06:30:42.960
[Guest 1]: and stuff and frankly when we did the performance

06:30:42.960 --> 06:30:44.960
[Guest 1]: Vishal ji came and said

06:30:44.960 --> 06:30:46.960
[Guest 1]: Roshan, we have done this show three times

06:30:46.960 --> 06:30:48.960
[Guest 1]: you are Lalit

06:30:48.960 --> 06:30:50.960
[Guest 1]: for me this was a big

06:30:50.960 --> 06:30:52.960
[Guest 1]: thing, Meera came

06:30:52.960 --> 06:30:54.960
[Guest 1]: to me and at that time she turned and said

06:30:54.960 --> 06:30:56.960
[Guest 1]: you are the essence of Lalit for me

06:30:56.960 --> 06:30:58.960
[Guest 1]: and obviously a director says

06:30:58.960 --> 06:31:00.960
[Guest 1]: things to all their actors to motivate

06:31:00.960 --> 06:31:02.960
[Guest 1]: them, her direction

06:31:02.960 --> 06:31:04.960
[Guest 1]: was unique, the first day she sat

06:31:04.960 --> 06:31:06.960
[Guest 1]: and did a session with me, she said you know

06:31:06.960 --> 06:31:08.960
[Guest 1]: Lalit and Pimmi's love is like an old

06:31:08.960 --> 06:31:10.960
[Guest 1]: shoe

06:31:10.960 --> 06:31:12.960
[Guest 1]: it's very comfortable

06:31:12.960 --> 06:31:14.960
[Guest 1]: but it's also very disregarded

06:31:14.960 --> 06:31:16.960
[Guest 1]: it was such a big thing

06:31:16.960 --> 06:31:18.960
[Guest 1]: she didn't tell me to behave like this with her

06:31:18.960 --> 06:31:20.960
[Guest 1]: this was enough direction

06:31:20.960 --> 06:31:22.960
[Guest 1]: enough direction for that relationship

06:31:22.960 --> 06:31:24.960
[Amit Varma]: to develop, it's a classic show don't tell

06:31:24.960 --> 06:31:26.960
[Guest 1]: and she does it

06:31:26.960 --> 06:31:28.960
[Guest 1]: with everyone

06:31:28.960 --> 06:31:30.960
[Guest 1]: like why does the thing of

06:31:30.960 --> 06:31:32.960
[Guest 1]: Dubey having the marigold flower

06:31:32.960 --> 06:31:34.960
[Guest 1]: she says it's their love

06:31:34.960 --> 06:31:36.960
[Guest 1]: is so good and

06:31:36.960 --> 06:31:38.960
[Guest 1]: so cheap in everyone's eyes

06:31:38.960 --> 06:31:40.960
[Guest 1]: marigold flower is not expensive

06:31:40.960 --> 06:31:42.960
[Guest 1]: like what all things

06:31:42.960 --> 06:31:44.960
[Guest 1]: and that music's understanding

06:31:44.960 --> 06:31:46.960
[Guest 1]: visual's understanding

06:31:46.960 --> 06:31:48.960
[Guest 1]: that was on a different level, so sometimes

06:31:48.960 --> 06:31:50.960
[Guest 1]: my directorial mind starts coming and I say no no

06:31:50.960 --> 06:31:52.960
[Guest 1]: act, don't direct in your mind

06:31:52.960 --> 06:31:54.960
[Guest 1]: that I do this and that

06:31:54.960 --> 06:31:56.960
[Guest 1]: which comes in

06:31:56.960 --> 06:31:58.960
[Guest 1]: but in the off times I would sit with Emily

06:31:58.960 --> 06:32:00.960
[Guest 1]: and say how does musical theatre work in the US

06:32:00.960 --> 06:32:02.960
[Guest 1]: what are these roles

06:32:02.960 --> 06:32:04.960
[Guest 1]: whatever and now as I said I want to do musical

06:32:04.960 --> 06:32:06.960
[Guest 1]: theatre workshops next year and let's see what happens

06:32:06.960 --> 06:32:08.960
[Guest 1]: with all that, should we do a play, I don't know but all that will happen

06:32:08.960 --> 06:32:10.960
[Guest 1]: but when we reached Doha

06:32:10.960 --> 06:32:12.960
[Guest 1]: it was a brand new

06:32:12.960 --> 06:32:14.960
[Guest 1]: challenge because new auditorium, brand

06:32:14.960 --> 06:32:16.960
[Guest 1]: new placement, brand new plotting

06:32:16.960 --> 06:32:18.960
[Guest 1]: technicals all of this started

06:32:18.960 --> 06:32:20.960
[Guest 1]: and the challenge of world cup is happening

06:32:20.960 --> 06:32:22.960
[Guest 1]: have you got your HIA visa or not

06:32:22.960 --> 06:32:24.960
[Guest 1]: blah blah all of this, in the middle of which

06:32:24.960 --> 06:32:26.960
[Guest 1]: Spoken Fest is going on here

06:32:26.960 --> 06:32:28.960
[Guest 1]: so my lunch breaks used to be how much sponsorship

06:32:28.960 --> 06:32:30.960
[Guest 1]: who should I call, I call him

06:32:30.960 --> 06:32:32.960
[Guest 1]: blah blah but I would only use that one otherwise I would

06:32:32.960 --> 06:32:34.960
[Guest 1]: be totally immersed in the play, again

06:32:34.960 --> 06:32:36.960
[Guest 1]: Sourav, Varun, the entire team here

06:32:36.960 --> 06:32:38.960
[Guest 1]: Vaishnavi, Nino, Aditya

06:32:38.960 --> 06:32:40.960
[Guest 1]: everybody, Tess, without Tess

06:32:40.960 --> 06:32:42.960
[Guest 1]: and Shantanu the curation would not have happened

06:32:42.960 --> 06:32:44.960
[Guest 1]: for Spoken and so what they build

06:32:44.960 --> 06:32:46.960
[Guest 1]: is absolutely unique, so they

06:32:46.960 --> 06:32:48.960
[Guest 1]: created that but they gave me the space to

06:32:48.960 --> 06:32:50.960
[Guest 1]: do this, when we started

06:32:50.960 --> 06:32:52.960
[Guest 1]: doing the show in Doha, again

06:32:52.960 --> 06:32:54.960
[Guest 1]: you know

06:32:54.960 --> 06:32:56.960
[Guest 1]: the day the show happened

06:32:56.960 --> 06:32:58.960
[Guest 1]: Meera walked on stage at the premiere

06:32:58.960 --> 06:33:00.960
[Guest 1]: and danced on stage with us and I

06:33:00.960 --> 06:33:02.960
[Guest 1]: know her, she is very very fun

06:33:02.960 --> 06:33:04.960
[Guest 1]: and then I got that one hug on stage

06:33:04.960 --> 06:33:06.960
[Guest 1]: and she just

06:33:06.960 --> 06:33:08.960
[Guest 1]: you know in my ear she turned and said

06:33:08.960 --> 06:33:10.960
[Guest 1]: you were impeccable and

06:33:10.960 --> 06:33:12.960
[Guest 1]: to me that was

06:33:12.960 --> 06:33:14.960
[Guest 1]: because

06:33:14.960 --> 06:33:18.960
[Guest 1]: either she will fire me or I will fire her because there was a lot of pressure

06:33:18.960 --> 06:33:20.960
[Guest 1]: I have to dance, I have to do this

06:33:20.960 --> 06:33:22.960
[Guest 1]: I am not a dancer, she knows

06:33:22.960 --> 06:33:24.960
[Guest 1]: I can do two steps with her but I am not

06:33:24.960 --> 06:33:26.960
[Guest 1]: you know, but I played it as a

06:33:26.960 --> 06:33:28.960
[Guest 1]: father of a bride who is an average

06:33:28.960 --> 06:33:30.960
[Guest 1]: dancer, that's fine, you can play

06:33:30.960 --> 06:33:32.960
[Guest 1]: like this, so that happened

06:33:32.960 --> 06:33:34.960
[Guest 1]: immense amount of learning

06:33:34.960 --> 06:33:36.960
[Guest 1]: very very satisfying and very humbling

06:33:36.960 --> 06:33:38.960
[Guest 1]: right, so I think that whole thing

06:33:38.960 --> 06:33:40.960
[Guest 1]: of learning new things comes

06:33:40.960 --> 06:33:42.960
[Guest 1]: in this manner, it has been

06:33:42.960 --> 06:33:44.960
[Guest 1]: incredible and we are now all waiting to see

06:33:44.960 --> 06:33:46.960
[Guest 1]: whether, show is definitely happening

06:33:46.960 --> 06:33:48.960
[Guest 1]: in April, now it's a matter of how many days

06:33:48.960 --> 06:33:50.960
[Guest 1]: are required, the

06:33:50.960 --> 06:33:52.960
[Guest 1]: Queen Anne theatre people where it is going to be done

06:33:52.960 --> 06:33:54.960
[Guest 1]: had come, they loved the show

06:33:54.960 --> 06:33:56.960
[Guest 1]: we had lots of discussions with them

06:33:56.960 --> 06:33:58.960
[Guest 1]: and these are discussions where we are talking about

06:33:58.960 --> 06:34:00.960
[Guest 1]: the tapestry of the show, what do you feel

06:34:00.960 --> 06:34:02.960
[Guest 1]: you know, what would you have

06:34:02.960 --> 06:34:04.960
[Guest 1]: done in this, could have done this

06:34:04.960 --> 06:34:06.960
[Guest 1]: and she has played with the play so much

06:34:06.960 --> 06:34:08.960
[Guest 1]: now over these years that she has got

06:34:08.960 --> 06:34:10.960
[Guest 1]: spoiled for choice about scenes and other things that we could

06:34:10.960 --> 06:34:12.960
[Guest 1]: do, absolutely, I mean I could

06:34:12.960 --> 06:34:14.960
[Guest 1]: not have asked for a better learning

06:34:14.960 --> 06:34:16.960
[Guest 1]: creative experience at the age

06:34:16.960 --> 06:34:18.960
[Guest 1]: of 52, you know, so I am

06:34:18.960 --> 06:34:20.960
[Guest 1]: really happy about it and hoping next year that

06:34:20.960 --> 06:34:22.960
[Guest 1]: we get what's called a call back, the actor

06:34:22.960 --> 06:34:24.960
[Guest 1]: call back will happen for all of us

06:34:24.960 --> 06:34:26.960
[Guest 1]: but it's a union driven thing, so we also

06:34:26.960 --> 06:34:28.960
[Guest 1]: need to wait for how many

06:34:28.960 --> 06:34:30.960
[Guest 1]: actors get, because you know you have a limited

06:34:30.960 --> 06:34:32.960
[Guest 1]: number of national actors you can take and all this but

06:34:32.960 --> 06:34:34.960
[Guest 1]: we are all sitting and praying and saying

06:34:34.960 --> 06:34:36.960
[Guest 2]: Honge Kamiya

06:34:36.960 --> 06:34:40.960
[Guest 1]: Kaunsa union hai, CM se baat pe?

06:34:40.960 --> 06:34:42.960
[Guest 1]: It's not like the people come knocking

06:34:42.960 --> 06:34:44.960
[Guest 1]: at Film City, Kaunsa aapke

06:34:44.960 --> 06:34:46.960
[Guest 1]: paas hai, card hai ke nahin

06:34:46.960 --> 06:34:48.960
[Amit Varma]: What I found impressive about

06:34:48.960 --> 06:34:50.960
[Amit Varma]: your stories of this play is

06:34:50.960 --> 06:34:52.960
[Amit Varma]: how you were able to go through

06:34:52.960 --> 06:34:54.960
[Amit Varma]: an unlearning and learning process

06:34:54.960 --> 06:34:56.960
[Amit Varma]: especially with regard to singing, tell me

06:34:56.960 --> 06:34:58.960
[Guest 1]: a little bit about that

06:34:58.960 --> 06:35:00.960
[Guest 1]: See the first thing is that

06:35:00.960 --> 06:35:02.960
[Guest 1]: western choral singing

06:35:02.960 --> 06:35:04.960
[Guest 1]: and Indian classical singing

06:35:04.960 --> 06:35:06.960
[Guest 1]: which is a very

06:35:06.960 --> 06:35:08.960
[Guest 1]: unique combination in this play

06:35:08.960 --> 06:35:10.960
[Guest 1]: one teaches you to

06:35:10.960 --> 06:35:12.960
[Guest 1]: sing on an out breath, one tells you to sing on an in breath

06:35:12.960 --> 06:35:14.960
[Guest 1]: right

06:35:14.960 --> 06:35:16.960
[Guest 1]: aap jab gaate na, aap jab

06:35:16.960 --> 06:35:18.960
[Guest 1]: raag waqara kar rahe hain

06:35:18.960 --> 06:35:20.960
[Guest 1]: you know and Namit actually

06:35:20.960 --> 06:35:22.960
[Guest 1]: told me this, ek sir dikhi yeh yaha par cheez hai

06:35:22.960 --> 06:35:24.960
[Guest 1]: toh yeh sunke seekhna padta hai

06:35:24.960 --> 06:35:26.960
[Guest 1]: then what happens is that

06:35:26.960 --> 06:35:28.960
[Guest 1]: western singing is a lot

06:35:28.960 --> 06:35:30.960
[Guest 1]: and Emily

06:35:30.960 --> 06:35:32.960
[Guest 1]: you know her fiance

06:35:32.960 --> 06:35:34.960
[Guest 1]: had come down and whatever for the play

06:35:34.960 --> 06:35:36.960
[Guest 1]: and he was watching it from a third and he said

06:35:36.960 --> 06:35:38.960
[Guest 1]: you know I'll tell you one thing, I've seen a lot of Broadway

06:35:38.960 --> 06:35:40.960
[Guest 1]: it has so much technique

06:35:40.960 --> 06:35:42.960
[Guest 1]: you all have so much heart

06:35:42.960 --> 06:35:44.960
[Guest 1]: and yeh sachahi hai because

06:35:44.960 --> 06:35:46.960
[Guest 1]: yaha par I do believe ke

06:35:46.960 --> 06:35:48.960
[Guest 1]: opera singer wo yeh jo hote hain wo head voice

06:35:48.960 --> 06:35:50.960
[Guest 1]: aur yeh voice wo sabse gaare hote hain

06:35:50.960 --> 06:35:52.960
[Guest 1]: hum log dil kolke gaare hote hain

06:35:52.960 --> 06:35:54.960
[Guest 1]: par wo dil se gaane me jo ek

06:35:54.960 --> 06:35:56.960
[Guest 1]: feeling hai, wo kahin aur nahi thi

06:35:56.960 --> 06:35:58.960
[Guest 1]: and when this whole thing was happening

06:35:58.960 --> 06:36:00.960
[Guest 1]: about learning the singing

06:36:00.960 --> 06:36:02.960
[Guest 1]: we had Maryanne who was this lovely teacher

06:36:02.960 --> 06:36:04.960
[Guest 1]: in Bombay who was telling us how to sing

06:36:04.960 --> 06:36:06.960
[Guest 1]: and she was taking extra

06:36:06.960 --> 06:36:08.960
[Guest 1]: classes with a few of us who had weaker voices

06:36:08.960 --> 06:36:10.960
[Guest 1]: which included me and another couple of

06:36:10.960 --> 06:36:12.960
[Guest 1]: actors and we were allowed to

06:36:12.960 --> 06:36:14.960
[Guest 1]: ask for more classes and I took more classes

06:36:14.960 --> 06:36:16.960
[Guest 1]: and learnt that to a certain degree

06:36:16.960 --> 06:36:18.960
[Guest 1]: then when you start working

06:36:18.960 --> 06:36:20.960
[Guest 1]: and you're harmonizing

06:36:20.960 --> 06:36:22.960
[Guest 1]: ab ek gaana hai jisme aapka

06:36:22.960 --> 06:36:24.960
[Guest 1]: mann kar raha hai ke you know

06:36:24.960 --> 06:36:26.960
[Guest 1]: no matter where you journey

06:36:26.960 --> 06:36:28.960
[Guest 1]: our love will journey too

06:36:28.960 --> 06:36:30.960
[Guest 1]: there's a song called Anand

06:36:30.960 --> 06:36:32.960
[Guest 1]: toh wo chal raha hai and I'm certainly told nahi nahi

06:36:32.960 --> 06:36:34.960
[Guest 1]: aap isko gaayenge apne

06:36:34.960 --> 06:36:36.960
[Guest 1]: no matter where you journey

06:36:36.960 --> 06:36:38.960
[Guest 1]: because the song's

06:36:38.960 --> 06:36:40.960
[Guest 1]: tapestry requires that, you are going

06:36:40.960 --> 06:36:42.960
[Guest 1]: to play bass, somebody else is soprano

06:36:42.960 --> 06:36:44.960
[Guest 1]: someone else is alto and when you

06:36:44.960 --> 06:36:46.960
[Guest 1]: see that come together, we had a day

06:36:46.960 --> 06:36:48.960
[Guest 1]: which was called a

06:36:48.960 --> 06:36:50.960
[Guest 1]: it was called a Sitzprobe

06:36:50.960 --> 06:36:52.960
[Guest 1]: we said this sounds rather

06:36:52.960 --> 06:36:54.960
[Guest 1]: weird, a Sitzprobe is what are we doing

06:36:54.960 --> 06:36:56.960
[Guest 1]: kaha probe karoge?

06:36:56.960 --> 06:36:58.960
[Guest 1]: ek Sitzprobe hota hai, the day when

06:36:58.960 --> 06:37:00.960
[Guest 1]: the musicians and the singers come together

06:37:00.960 --> 06:37:02.960
[Guest 1]: as a group for the first time

06:37:02.960 --> 06:37:04.960
[Guest 1]: otherwise they perform individually

06:37:04.960 --> 06:37:06.960
[Guest 1]: which is what we were doing, rehearsing with the piano and stuff

06:37:06.960 --> 06:37:08.960
[Guest 1]: and we would do vocal exercises in the morning

06:37:08.960 --> 06:37:10.960
[Guest 1]: and stuff

06:37:10.960 --> 06:37:12.960
[Guest 1]: vocal exercises in the morning etc

06:37:12.960 --> 06:37:14.960
[Guest 1]: used to happen but the day the Sitzprobe

06:37:14.960 --> 06:37:16.960
[Guest 1]: happened is the day I actually put up my post on

06:37:16.960 --> 06:37:18.960
[Guest 1]: Instagram where I said you know three months of doing this

06:37:18.960 --> 06:37:20.960
[Guest 1]: and

06:37:20.960 --> 06:37:22.960
[Guest 1]: having a 29 year old

06:37:22.960 --> 06:37:24.960
[Guest 1]: Fernanda Douglas who's a brilliant teacher

06:37:24.960 --> 06:37:26.960
[Guest 1]: absolutely brilliant

06:37:26.960 --> 06:37:28.960
[Guest 1]: sitting with me and telling me when I was singing

06:37:28.960 --> 06:37:30.960
[Guest 1]: again the song

06:37:30.960 --> 06:37:32.960
[Guest 1]: Meeraj used to say pura word bolo

06:37:32.960 --> 06:37:34.960
[Guest 1]: because my song starts

06:37:34.960 --> 06:37:36.960
[Guest 1]: Angan starts with me singing a line which says

06:37:36.960 --> 06:37:38.960
[Guest 1]: Rest

06:37:38.960 --> 06:37:40.960
[Unknown]: in the warmth of

06:37:40.960 --> 06:37:42.960
[Guest 1]: this Angan

06:37:42.960 --> 06:37:44.960

[Guest 1]: hai lagta hai, whatever and stuff

06:37:54.960 --> 06:37:56.960

[Guest 1]: so let it

06:37:58.960 --> 06:38:00.960

[Guest 1]: of this Angan

06:38:04.960 --> 06:38:06.960
[Guest 1]: and she would just make me

06:38:06.960 --> 06:38:08.960
[Guest 1]: visualize it

06:38:08.960 --> 06:38:10.960
[Unknown]: and four walls and the sun

06:38:10.960 --> 06:38:12.960
[Unknown]: and the sky

[Guest 1]: aur audience roti thi

06:40:52.960 --> 06:40:54.960
[Guest 1]: because aap moment mein

06:40:54.960 --> 06:40:56.960
[Guest 1]: saath mein aapko pata hai ki aadmi

06:40:56.960 --> 06:40:58.960
[Guest 1]: apne bacche se baat kar raha hai

06:40:58.960 --> 06:41:00.960
[Guest 1]: yeh chila chila aur

06:41:00.960 --> 06:41:02.960
[Guest 1]: isko pata hai normally I'm a

06:41:02.960 --> 06:41:04.960
[Guest 1]: power singer which means when I can't hit a note

06:41:04.960 --> 06:41:06.960
[Guest 1]: I project so

06:41:06.960 --> 06:41:08.960
[Guest 1]: high but I was not allowed

06:41:08.960 --> 06:41:10.960
[Guest 1]: to hold back and do it

06:41:10.960 --> 06:41:12.960
[Guest 1]: and there's only one line in this which is

06:41:12.960 --> 06:41:14.960
[Unknown]: where I'm actually saying come home

06:41:14.960 --> 06:41:16.960
[Unknown]: with me, come home

06:41:16.960 --> 06:41:18.960
[Unknown]: with me, come home

06:41:18.960 --> 06:41:20.960
[Guest 1]: aur yeh

06:41:20.960 --> 06:41:22.960
[Guest 1]: originally main utaar to come home

06:41:22.960 --> 06:41:24.960
[Guest 1]: with me, come home yeh ho raha tha

06:41:24.960 --> 06:41:26.960
[Unknown]: nahi bhaiya

06:41:26.960 --> 06:41:28.960
[Guest 1]: bulao aur bula ke matlab

06:41:28.960 --> 06:41:30.960
[Guest 1]: ro rahe ho ke yaar wo aa nahi rahi hai

06:41:30.960 --> 06:41:32.960
[Guest 1]: and right after that there's a beautiful speech

06:41:32.960 --> 06:41:34.960
[Guest 1]: and again

06:41:34.960 --> 06:41:36.960
[Guest 1]: Meera used to point it out because I'd finished the song and I'd come into

06:41:36.960 --> 06:41:38.960
[Guest 1]: the speech and no, what happened

06:41:38.960 --> 06:41:40.960
[Guest 1]: she says stay in that moment

06:41:40.960 --> 06:41:42.960
[Guest 1]: and I was like but there's a beat

06:41:42.960 --> 06:41:44.960
[Guest 1]: she says Roshan, the musicians will

06:41:44.960 --> 06:41:46.960
[Guest 1]: stay

06:41:46.960 --> 06:41:48.960
[Guest 1]: aap ginti mat giniye

06:41:48.960 --> 06:41:50.960
[Guest 1]: ki do ke baad, accha hum log aata hai ki

06:41:50.960 --> 06:41:52.960
[Guest 1]: niti pe aana hai, chaar pe aana hai, na

06:41:52.960 --> 06:41:54.960
[Guest 1]: theatre hai feel karna hai

06:41:54.960 --> 06:41:56.960
[Guest 1]: aur wo jo thi, the ability to feel

06:41:56.960 --> 06:41:58.960
[Guest 1]: and I mean Shaheen watched the first show

06:41:58.960 --> 06:42:00.960
[Guest 1]: then she watched one more show then she came for the

06:42:00.960 --> 06:42:02.960
[Guest 1]: third show and the one

06:42:02.960 --> 06:42:04.960
[Guest 1]: day she was supposed to come and we had a double show and she

06:42:04.960 --> 06:42:06.960
[Guest 1]: couldn't because she slept and she was so upset

06:42:06.960 --> 06:42:08.960
[Guest 1]: like how could I not see

06:42:08.960 --> 06:42:10.960
[Guest 1]: I mean if Shaheen saw three shows

06:42:10.960 --> 06:42:12.960
[Guest 1]: and my wife is very loving and very

06:42:12.960 --> 06:42:14.960
[Guest 1]: whatever but she's also very critical of my work

06:42:14.960 --> 06:42:16.960
[Guest 1]: and each day when she came back

06:42:16.960 --> 06:42:18.960
[Guest 1]: she was like I could see that she had cried her

06:42:18.960 --> 06:42:20.960
[Guest 1]: eyes out in every show

06:42:20.960 --> 06:42:22.960
[Guest 1]: and you know when she turned she says you know if

06:42:22.960 --> 06:42:24.960
[Guest 1]: I so wish all our friends were here

06:42:24.960 --> 06:42:26.960

[Guest 1]: which is a very big thing

06:43:08.960 --> 06:43:10.960

[Guest 1]: waha se ek rasta tha which you could just

06:43:16.960 --> 06:43:18.960
[Guest 1]: go anonymously but as an actor

06:43:18.960 --> 06:43:20.960
[Guest 1]: you don't want to do that, you want to almost

06:43:20.960 --> 06:43:22.960
[Guest 1]: bump into the audience

06:43:22.960 --> 06:43:24.960
[Guest 1]: right and be very honest

06:43:24.960 --> 06:43:26.960
[Guest 1]: and you do it for that moment, waha par pohache hua hai

06:43:26.960 --> 06:43:28.960
[Guest 1]: aur audience, these ladies were there

06:43:28.960 --> 06:43:30.960
[Guest 1]: so suddenly the manager said

06:43:30.960 --> 06:43:32.960
[Unknown]: Mr. Roshan, yes

06:43:32.960 --> 06:43:34.960

[Guest 1]: of them like this and they took pictures

06:43:42.960 --> 06:43:44.960

[Guest 1]: you know specimen number 233 and whatever

06:43:52.960 --> 06:43:54.960
[Guest 1]: but I just did lots of smiles and

[Guest 1]: whatever and left, then there were all

06:43:56.960 --> 06:43:58.960
[Guest 1]: our, Roshan bhai

06:43:58.960 --> 06:44:00.960
[Guest 1]: main Delhi se aapko dekh raha tha

06:44:00.960 --> 06:44:02.960
[Guest 1]: radio pe, my god

[Guest 1]: wale bhi audience thi

06:44:04.960 --> 06:44:06.960
[Guest 1]: par wo jo khushi thi, wo bahut zyada thi

06:44:06.960 --> 06:44:08.960
[Unknown]: toh waha par wahi ne, bahut hi aisi

06:44:08.960 --> 06:44:10.960
[Unknown]: par is kisum ki thi

06:44:10.960 --> 06:44:12.960
[Unknown]: amazing

06:44:12.960 --> 06:44:14.960
[Unknown]: namuna

06:44:14.960 --> 06:44:16.960
[Amit Varma]: kala ka tasmeer hai

06:44:16.960 --> 06:44:18.960
[Amit Varma]: so Vikram, tell me about your journey through music

06:44:18.960 --> 06:44:20.960
[Amit Varma]: because what I have noticed is that you sing damn well

06:44:20.960 --> 06:44:22.960
[Amit Varma]: I know that you would sing as a kid

06:44:22.960 --> 06:44:24.960
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, you have

06:44:24.960 --> 06:44:26.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, you did all of these things with the

06:44:26.960 --> 06:44:28.960
[Amit Varma]: Bawras, so you weren't singing obviously

06:44:28.960 --> 06:44:30.960
[Amit Varma]: but, or were you singing also?

06:44:30.960 --> 06:44:32.960
[Guest 2]: no, I was not singing with them

06:44:32.960 --> 06:44:34.960
[Unknown]: because they were very good singers

06:44:34.960 --> 06:44:36.960
[Unknown]: you must do your

06:44:36.960 --> 06:44:38.960
[Guest 1]: Bhimsen Joshi

06:44:38.960 --> 06:44:40.960
[Guest 2]: kindly do Bhimsen Joshi

06:44:40.960 --> 06:44:42.960
[Guest 2]: as I said, my mum

06:44:42.960 --> 06:44:44.960
[Guest 2]: was a huge influence because of

06:44:44.960 --> 06:44:46.960
[Guest 2]: the classical music scenario

06:44:46.960 --> 06:44:48.960
[Guest 2]: and unfortunately what happened was

06:44:48.960 --> 06:44:50.960
[Guest 2]: when she was doing her riyaz

06:44:50.960 --> 06:44:52.960
[Guest 2]: I would sing those songs

06:44:52.960 --> 06:44:54.960
[Guest 2]: and I would go into a wrong raag

06:44:54.960 --> 06:44:56.960
[Guest 2]: and at one point of time she started

06:44:56.960 --> 06:44:58.960
[Guest 2]: cursing me because she also started singing

06:44:58.960 --> 06:45:00.960
[Guest 2]: wrongly

06:45:00.960 --> 06:45:02.960
[Guest 2]: can you give us an example?

06:45:02.960 --> 06:45:04.960
[Guest 2]: I basically

06:45:04.960 --> 06:45:06.960
[Guest 2]: can't give you an example because this was some

06:45:06.960 --> 06:45:08.960
[Guest 2]: it was not this, I think it was a

06:45:08.960 --> 06:45:10.960
[Guest 2]: Malkaus or something

06:45:10.960 --> 06:45:12.960
[Guest 2]: like that, which I had completely messed it up

06:45:12.960 --> 06:45:14.960
[Guest 2]: for her, but Bhimsen Joshi was

06:45:14.960 --> 06:45:16.960
[Guest 2]: somebody who we saw every

06:45:16.960 --> 06:45:18.960
[Guest 2]: year 6 am in the morning and

06:45:18.960 --> 06:45:20.960
[Guest 2]: you know, he had this unique

06:45:20.960 --> 06:45:22.960
[Guest 2]: ability as in

06:45:22.960 --> 06:45:24.960
[Guest 2]: and he was damn funny right

06:45:24.960 --> 06:45:26.960
[Guest 2]: when he was in his total groove

06:45:26.960 --> 06:45:28.960
[Guest 2]: once I believe he

06:45:28.960 --> 06:45:30.960
[Guest 2]: pulled the mat

06:45:30.960 --> 06:45:32.960
[Guest 2]: under the tabla wala and stuff like that

06:45:32.960 --> 06:45:34.960
[Guest 2]: tabla wala was playing and he was getting dragged

06:45:34.960 --> 06:45:36.960
[Guest 2]: while he was playing his tabla

06:45:36.960 --> 06:45:52.960
[Unknown]: but he had this unique style you know

06:46:06.960 --> 06:46:26.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:46:26.960 --> 06:46:28.960
[Guest 2]: that was the great

06:46:28.960 --> 06:46:30.960
[Guest 1]: Bhimsen Joshi

06:46:30.960 --> 06:46:32.960
[Amit Varma]: you need a video portion of this

06:46:32.960 --> 06:46:34.960
[Guest 2]: we need a video portion of this

06:46:34.960 --> 06:46:36.960
[Guest 2]: so then it kind of became more

06:46:36.960 --> 06:46:38.960
[Guest 2]: of imitating singers

06:46:38.960 --> 06:46:40.960
[Guest 2]: but yeah when Roshan and me we all together

06:46:40.960 --> 06:46:42.960
[Guest 2]: we sing all, everybody from SD Burman to

06:46:42.960 --> 06:46:44.960
[Guest 2]: Shankar Mahadevan

06:46:44.960 --> 06:46:46.960
[Guest 2]: because I am a huge Shankar Mahadevan

06:46:46.960 --> 06:46:48.960
[Guest 2]: fan, the kind of work that

06:46:48.960 --> 06:46:50.960
[Guest 1]: he has done, but we can

06:46:50.960 --> 06:46:52.960
[Guest 1]: but his biggest, I must tell you because he doesn't want

06:46:52.960 --> 06:46:54.960
[Guest 1]: to give away his entire stage act

06:46:54.960 --> 06:46:56.960
[Guest 1]: but the bit that he does about

06:46:56.960 --> 06:46:58.960
[Guest 1]: so he does this whole

06:46:58.960 --> 06:47:00.960
[Guest 1]: various singers and their levels of constipation

06:47:00.960 --> 06:47:02.960
[Guest 2]: and why they sing

06:47:02.960 --> 06:47:04.960
[Guest 2]: so this was an act

06:47:04.960 --> 06:47:06.960
[Guest 1]: I used to do

06:47:06.960 --> 06:47:08.960
[Guest 2]: I am sorry

06:47:08.960 --> 06:47:10.960
[Unknown]: don't even do

06:47:10.960 --> 06:47:12.960
[Guest 2]: this act anymore

06:47:12.960 --> 06:47:14.960
[Guest 2]: so my theory was that

06:47:14.960 --> 06:47:16.960
[Guest 2]: every Bollywood singer suffers from constipation

06:47:16.960 --> 06:47:18.960
[Guest 2]: and the first stage is

06:47:18.960 --> 06:47:20.960
[Guest 2]: Kumar Sanu

06:47:20.960 --> 06:47:22.960
[Unknown]: so

06:47:22.960 --> 06:47:24.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:47:24.960 --> 06:47:26.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:47:26.960 --> 06:47:28.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:47:28.960 --> 06:47:30.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:47:30.960 --> 06:47:32.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:47:32.960 --> 06:47:34.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:47:34.960 --> 06:47:36.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:47:36.960 --> 06:47:38.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:47:38.960 --> 06:47:40.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:47:40.960 --> 06:47:42.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:47:42.960 --> 06:47:44.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:47:44.960 --> 06:47:46.960
[Guest 2]: singing

06:47:46.960 --> 06:47:48.960
[Guest 2]: so lucky Ali said

06:47:48.960 --> 06:47:50.960
[Guest 2]: if this guy can constipate I can do it at level 2

06:47:50.960 --> 06:47:52.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:47:52.960 --> 06:47:54.960
[Unknown]: singing

06:47:54.960 --> 06:47:56.960
[Unknown]: singing

[Guest 2]: singing

06:48:26.960 --> 06:48:31.800
[Guest 2]: Narayan. The song from Lagaan started very well. But see what happened to it.

06:48:31.800 --> 06:48:41.080
[Unknown]: Ghanan ghanan ghir ghir aaye badra, ghan ghan ghor kare chhaye badra, damag damag gujhe badra ke dang ke,

06:48:41.080 --> 06:48:48.040
[Unknown]: damag damag dekho vijriye chamke, man dhadkaaye badarwa.

06:48:48.040 --> 06:48:55.480
[Guest 2]: Vaat laga di constipation ki. So this was an act which was hugely popular and I would go on, right, you know,

06:48:55.480 --> 06:49:05.200
[Guest 2]: the little bit of constipation of, you know, erotic constipation of Sonu Nigam, where he would, like the same song that you sang, Roshan.

06:49:05.200 --> 06:49:14.680
[Unknown]: Al ko khile ke saaye. So extended constipation, Sonu Nigam.

06:49:14.680 --> 06:49:29.480
[Unknown]: Aas koi jo aaye, laakh samhalo paagal dil ko,

06:49:29.480 --> 06:49:40.720
[Unknown]: dil dhadke hi jaye, is haath ko, tum thamlo.

06:49:40.720 --> 06:49:47.800
[Unknown]: O meharwa, kal ho na ho.

06:49:47.800 --> 06:49:53.320
[Guest 2]: I would not even touch Himesh Rashmiya because it would be an incurable disease.

06:49:53.320 --> 06:50:00.840
[Guest 2]: So yeah, that continued and then one song that kind of united was Swanan's song.

06:50:00.840 --> 06:50:03.120
[Guest 2]: Let's sing it together.

06:50:03.120 --> 06:50:17.880
[Unknown]: Bawra man dekhne chala ek sapna.

06:50:17.880 --> 06:50:36.160
[Unknown]: Bawre se man ki dekho, bawri hai baatein. Bawri si dhadkane hain, bawri hai saanse. Bawri se karvato se,

06:50:36.160 --> 06:50:52.520
[Unknown]: nindiya kyon bhaage. Bawre se nain chahe, bawre jaronkon se, bawre nazaron ko tak na.

06:50:52.520 --> 06:51:10.800
[Unknown]: Bawra man dekhne chala ek sapna.

06:51:10.800 --> 06:51:12.800
[Guest 1]: Beautiful, arre waah, amazing.

06:51:12.800 --> 06:51:15.360
[Guest 1]: Dekhi maine inke soprano ke saath base hi lagaya.

06:51:15.360 --> 06:51:16.880
[Unknown]: Main wahi dekhna tha ki...

06:51:16.880 --> 06:51:19.520
[Guest 2]: Mewaani kiya, mewaani kiya.

06:51:19.520 --> 06:51:26.600
[Guest 2]: Constipation gangane ke baad, base pe pakadna hi tha.

06:51:26.600 --> 06:51:28.600
[Guest 2]: Roshan bhai, aap bhi ek gaano.

06:51:28.600 --> 06:51:30.600
[Guest 2]: Main toh abhi toh...

06:51:30.600 --> 06:51:44.600
[Guest 2]: Roshan sings a song which is very dear to my heart, Shankar Ehsaan Loi and you know, it was my way of expressing my frustration when I had typhoid and I had my temperatures to go from 100 to 104.

06:51:44.600 --> 06:51:52.600
[Guest 2]: So, Nilesh, our friend used to say that through his singing, I would know whether the temperature is 101, 102, 103 or whatever.

06:51:52.600 --> 06:51:57.600
[Guest 2]: So, when I said mitwa, it meant 101.

06:51:57.600 --> 06:52:02.600
[Guest 2]: Mitwa, 102.

06:52:02.600 --> 06:52:04.600
[Guest 2]: Mitwa...

06:52:04.600 --> 06:52:14.600
[Guest 2]: So, but you must sing two lines of mitwa.

06:52:14.600 --> 06:52:16.600
[Unknown]: Scale badal le chale.

06:52:16.600 --> 06:52:26.600
[Unknown]: Mere mann yeh bata de tu, kis aur chala hai tu.

06:52:26.600 --> 06:52:35.600
[Unknown]: Kya paaya nahi tu ne, kya dhoond raha hai tu.

06:52:35.600 --> 06:52:45.600
[Unknown]: Jo hai ankahi, jo hai ansuni, wo baat kya hai bata.

06:52:45.600 --> 06:52:54.600
[Unknown]: Mitwa, kahe dhadkane tujh se kya.

06:52:54.600 --> 06:53:04.600
[Unknown]: Mitwa, yeh khud se toh na tu chhupa.

06:53:04.600 --> 06:53:06.600
[Unknown]: Amazing.

06:53:06.600 --> 06:53:11.600
[Guest 2]: But Amit, how can we forget Baljeet?

06:53:11.600 --> 06:53:13.600
[Unknown]: We have to do Baljeet.

06:53:13.600 --> 06:53:16.600
[Unknown]: First, let's tell the history of Baljeet.

06:53:16.600 --> 06:53:18.600
[Guest 1]: Who is Baljeet?

06:53:18.600 --> 06:53:25.600
[Guest 2]: Actually, both of us have a bad memory, but we know that we formed a cult.

06:53:25.600 --> 06:53:27.600
[Guest 2]: 50 years ago.

06:53:27.600 --> 06:53:30.600
[Guest 2]: How was it formed? Why?

06:53:30.600 --> 06:53:35.600
[Guest 2]: There were two cults. One was called Conehead and the other was called Baljeet.

06:53:35.600 --> 06:53:36.600
[Guest 2]: And one was called Parpeetaram.

06:53:36.600 --> 06:53:39.600
[Unknown]: Yes, Parpeetaram, but it was an accounting company.

06:53:39.600 --> 06:53:43.600
[Guest 2]: It was a front-faced company.

06:53:43.600 --> 06:53:51.600
[Guest 2]: So, at one time, Amit Verma used to not only diet, but he also tried to exercise.

06:53:51.600 --> 06:53:53.600
[Amit Varma]: It's true.

06:53:53.600 --> 06:53:58.600
[Guest 2]: This was probably 20 years back and one fine day we decided that let's exercise.

06:53:58.600 --> 06:54:01.600
[Guest 2]: And let's not let the feeling pass, we'll exercise.

06:54:01.600 --> 06:54:05.600
[Guest 2]: So we felt like exercising and both started jogging in the morning.

06:54:05.600 --> 06:54:07.600
[Guest 2]: It's been 2-3 days now.

06:54:07.600 --> 06:54:13.600
[Guest 2]: The momentum was shifting that why do we have to jog.

06:54:13.600 --> 06:54:20.600
[Guest 2]: But then at the jogger's park in Lokhandwala, we met a guy who gave us tea.

06:54:20.600 --> 06:54:26.600
[Guest 2]: And somewhere at some point of time when we turned, we realized that he had a conical head.

06:54:26.600 --> 06:54:30.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, we started calling him Conehead because his head was a cone.

06:54:30.600 --> 06:54:35.600
[Amit Varma]: Like you would see in the Star Trek films, I think, but very pronounced.

06:54:35.600 --> 06:54:38.600
[Amit Varma]: So after that, it became like a thing.

06:54:38.600 --> 06:54:40.600
[Amit Varma]: There is no mood for jogging.

06:54:40.600 --> 06:54:42.600
[Amit Varma]: Who will wake up early in the morning?

06:54:42.600 --> 06:54:44.600
[Amit Varma]: But Conehead is there.

06:54:44.600 --> 06:54:46.600
[Guest 2]: He is making tea.

06:54:46.600 --> 06:54:47.600
[Guest 2]: Who will drink it?

06:54:47.600 --> 06:54:50.600
[Guest 2]: And if his tea doesn't sell, we will feel bad.

06:54:50.600 --> 06:54:54.600
[Guest 2]: So for just this, whatever.

06:54:54.600 --> 06:54:57.600
[Guest 2]: Sometimes I think he was an imaginary character.

06:54:57.600 --> 06:54:59.600
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I remember Conehead.

06:54:59.600 --> 06:55:03.600
[Guest 2]: And because of Conehead, we went for 2 months of jogging.

06:55:03.600 --> 06:55:10.600
[Guest 2]: And that guy became like an underlying conscience keeper in our life.

06:55:10.600 --> 06:55:17.600
[Guest 2]: Whenever we had a lack of motivation, we used to remember that Conehead is there for us.

06:55:17.600 --> 06:55:19.600
[Guest 2]: That's why we have to go.

06:55:19.600 --> 06:55:24.600
[Guest 2]: And I am sure before every recording, Amit remembers Conehead.

06:55:24.600 --> 06:55:27.600
[Amit Varma]: Actually, I don't, but now I will because you have said it.

06:55:27.600 --> 06:55:32.600
[Amit Varma]: But the Baljeet is a more interesting story because that actually there was a Baljeet song and a Baljeet dance.

06:55:32.600 --> 06:55:36.600
[Amit Varma]: So he will sing it for us, but I won't dance.

06:55:36.600 --> 06:55:42.600
[Amit Varma]: But the lines were that Baljeet is my brother, I am Baljeet's sister, Sanam is unfaithful.

06:55:42.600 --> 06:55:48.600
[Amit Varma]: I have no freaking idea how we came up with the lines, but this was me and Vikram.

06:55:48.600 --> 06:55:50.600
[Amit Varma]: This was for both of us.

06:55:50.600 --> 06:55:54.600
[Amit Varma]: So the day I left MTV, not the day I left, but my last day in MTV.

06:55:54.600 --> 06:55:58.600
[Amit Varma]: We decided that okay, let's dance a little on this.

06:55:58.600 --> 06:56:01.600
[Amit Varma]: So I remember we got Yasmin Jain who was in head of production.

06:56:01.600 --> 06:56:02.600
[Unknown]: Hemant Kinkre.

06:56:02.600 --> 06:56:04.600
[Amit Varma]: Hemant Kinkre and Saurabh.

06:56:06.600 --> 06:56:08.600
[Amit Varma]: I think one more person.

06:56:08.600 --> 06:56:10.600
[Amit Varma]: And they paid tribute to his exit.

06:56:10.600 --> 06:56:13.600
[Amit Varma]: So we all, and I still remember the steps.

06:56:13.600 --> 06:56:17.600
[Amit Varma]: So we did a dance, he was singing, we did a dance to Baljeet.

06:56:17.600 --> 06:56:22.600
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, it was a very poignant moving moment because it was my last day there.

06:56:22.600 --> 06:56:24.600
[Guest 2]: But we have carried Baljeet with us.

06:56:24.600 --> 06:56:26.600
[Guest 2]: Yeah, we have carried Baljeet with us.

06:56:26.600 --> 06:56:33.600
[Guest 2]: You know, it so happened that one day Amit, we used to drive from Lokhandwala to MTV office many times.

06:56:33.600 --> 06:56:38.600
[Guest 2]: And for some strange reason, one day we started calling each other Baljeet.

06:56:38.600 --> 06:56:40.600
[Guest 2]: I used to call him Amit, he used to call me Vikram.

06:56:40.600 --> 06:56:41.600
[Guest 2]: What Baljeet, what's happening?

06:56:41.600 --> 06:56:43.600
[Guest 2]: So he said, yes Baljeet, everything is fine.

06:56:43.600 --> 06:56:46.600
[Guest 2]: So Baljeet became a binding factor between us.

06:56:46.600 --> 06:56:50.600
[Guest 2]: And then there was this song in the 90s if you remember.

06:56:50.600 --> 06:56:57.600
[Unknown]: You broke my heart, you left me nowhere, my love is unfaithful.

06:56:57.600 --> 06:56:58.600
[Guest 1]: So in Sanam.

06:56:58.600 --> 06:56:59.600
[Guest 2]: The film Sanam Bewafa.

06:56:59.600 --> 06:57:01.600
[Guest 2]: Yeah, Sanam Bewafa, I think it was Salman Khan.

06:57:01.600 --> 06:57:06.600
[Guest 2]: So Sanam Bewafa's song entered Baljeet.

06:57:06.600 --> 06:57:08.600
[Guest 2]: One evening at 8 o'clock.

06:57:08.600 --> 06:57:13.600
[Guest 2]: And then what did he, like you said, what is your word, acting?

06:57:13.600 --> 06:57:14.600
[Guest 2]: What?

06:57:14.600 --> 06:57:15.600
[Unknown]: Triple threat.

06:57:15.600 --> 06:57:16.600
[Unknown]: Triple, yeah.

06:57:16.600 --> 06:57:18.600
[Guest 2]: We also had a triple threat.

06:57:18.600 --> 06:57:20.600
[Guest 2]: This was a threat actually.

06:57:20.600 --> 06:57:21.600
[Guest 2]: Dancing.

06:57:21.600 --> 06:57:24.600
[Guest 2]: And then came this legendary song.

06:57:24.600 --> 06:57:28.600
[Guest 2]: But we don't know why Baljeet and Baljeet's sister was referenced.

06:57:28.600 --> 06:57:29.600
[Amit Varma]: No idea.

06:57:29.600 --> 06:57:32.600
[Guest 2]: But the song and the dance sequence was clapping.

06:57:32.600 --> 06:57:36.600
[Unknown]: So Baljeet is my brother.

06:57:36.600 --> 06:57:40.600
[Unknown]: I am Baljeet's sister, Sanam Bewafa.

06:57:42.600 --> 06:57:45.600
[Unknown]: We still don't know why Baljeet existed.

06:57:45.600 --> 06:57:47.600
[Guest 2]: Why this song existed.

06:57:47.600 --> 06:57:48.600
[Guest 2]: Why this dance existed.

06:57:48.600 --> 06:57:52.600
[Guest 2]: But I think the best farewell Amit Verma has ever received in his life.

06:57:52.600 --> 06:57:54.600
[Amit Varma]: It's the greatest farewell in the history of MTV.

06:57:54.600 --> 06:57:56.600
[Amit Varma]: And if you remember, it went downhill from there.

06:57:56.600 --> 06:57:58.600
[Amit Varma]: Rodis, Vodis, everything came after that.

06:57:58.600 --> 06:58:01.600
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, that was like, the Baljeet was a high point.

06:58:01.600 --> 06:58:06.600
[Amit Varma]: And if we are talking about Baljeet, then we are also talking about Jack and Jill.

06:58:08.600 --> 06:58:12.600
[Guest 1]: So I think actually, just like Sathe had developed his act.

06:58:12.600 --> 06:58:14.600
[Guest 1]: So I used to host many years before that.

06:58:14.600 --> 06:58:19.600
[Guest 1]: And it started in a Lucknow college festival.

06:58:19.600 --> 06:58:21.600
[Guest 1]: Where I had to go on stage.

06:58:21.600 --> 06:58:25.600
[Guest 1]: And I used to go to festivals for money.

06:58:25.600 --> 06:58:27.600
[Guest 1]: Because I used to know that he was getting 200, he was getting 500.

06:58:27.600 --> 06:58:29.600
[Guest 1]: So pocket money used to be 1000.

06:58:29.600 --> 06:58:30.600
[Guest 2]: So it used to be supplemented.

06:58:30.600 --> 06:58:32.600
[Unknown]: Sir, you used to go for money only.

06:58:32.600 --> 06:58:35.600
[Guest 1]: No, girls colleges used to have more opportunities.

06:58:35.600 --> 06:58:37.600
[Guest 1]: I am sorry to be very honest.

06:58:37.600 --> 06:58:39.600
[Guest 1]: But I used to go to Lucknow.

06:58:39.600 --> 06:58:41.600
[Guest 1]: And suddenly this thing happened.

06:58:41.600 --> 06:58:44.600
[Guest 1]: You know, I saw a brilliant actor.

06:58:44.600 --> 06:58:46.600
[Guest 1]: And I mean, I don't know what happened to him.

06:58:46.600 --> 06:58:48.600
[Guest 1]: But there was an actor from Aligarh Muslim University.

06:58:48.600 --> 06:58:50.600
[Guest 1]: He came on stage in mono acting.

06:58:50.600 --> 06:58:52.600
[Guest 1]: And he did it so well.

06:58:52.600 --> 06:58:54.600
[Guest 1]: He was able to do.

06:58:54.600 --> 06:58:57.600
[Guest 1]: He used to say that I am coming up and playing Jekyll and Hyde.

06:58:57.600 --> 06:59:00.600
[Guest 1]: And he would first do Jekyll and then do Hyde.

06:59:00.600 --> 06:59:01.600
[Guest 1]: And then he acts amazing.

06:59:01.600 --> 06:59:03.600
[Guest 1]: I don't know how he could do it.

06:59:03.600 --> 06:59:06.600
[Guest 1]: But he would keep one half of his face absolutely straight.

06:59:06.600 --> 06:59:08.600
[Guest 1]: And only contort the other half.

06:59:08.600 --> 06:59:10.600
[Guest 1]: So we looked at him and said, no one can win with this.

06:59:10.600 --> 06:59:12.600
[Amit Varma]: You think this guy is Baljeet?

06:59:12.600 --> 06:59:14.600
[Guest 1]: You know what, but I swear.

06:59:14.600 --> 06:59:16.600
[Guest 1]: And his banner.

06:59:16.600 --> 06:59:17.600
[Guest 1]: Exactly.

06:59:17.600 --> 06:59:21.600
[Guest 1]: And I have never seen a better mono actor.

06:59:21.600 --> 06:59:24.600
[Guest 1]: So I looked at him and said there is no chance of winning.

06:59:24.600 --> 06:59:26.600
[Guest 1]: So let's go and entertain.

06:59:26.600 --> 06:59:28.600
[Guest 1]: So I went on stage and I think this was the first time that.

06:59:28.600 --> 06:59:31.600
[Guest 1]: So Jekyll and Hyde became a story where I would get on stage.

06:59:31.600 --> 06:59:33.600
[Guest 1]: And this has lasted me till.

06:59:33.600 --> 06:59:37.600
[Guest 1]: Even I think I don't host corporate events in that manner.

06:59:37.600 --> 06:59:39.600
[Guest 1]: Now I only go for talks.

06:59:39.600 --> 06:59:40.600
[Guest 1]: Till I did.

06:59:40.600 --> 06:59:42.600
[Guest 1]: Any moment.

06:59:42.600 --> 06:59:45.600
[Guest 1]: Whether it's a fashion show or a corporate event.

06:59:45.600 --> 06:59:47.600
[Guest 1]: Or Malaika Arora's clothes are not ready backstage.

06:59:47.600 --> 06:59:49.600
[Guest 1]: Or the dancer is not here.

06:59:49.600 --> 06:59:50.600
[Guest 1]: Or the lights are not on.

06:59:50.600 --> 06:59:51.600
[Guest 1]: Send me to Roshan Mas.

06:59:51.600 --> 06:59:52.600
[Guest 1]: I have to handle the boss.

06:59:52.600 --> 06:59:54.600
[Guest 1]: I don't know how long.

06:59:54.600 --> 06:59:55.600
[Guest 1]: I don't know.

06:59:55.600 --> 06:59:56.600
[Guest 1]: I don't know means.

06:59:56.600 --> 06:59:58.600
[Guest 1]: Because Jekyll and Hyde is me doing Jekyll and Hyde.

06:59:58.600 --> 07:00:00.600
[Guest 1]: In as many singers as possible.

07:00:00.600 --> 07:00:02.600
[Guest 1]: If I have heard the singer.

07:00:02.600 --> 07:00:04.600
[Guest 1]: People respond to the tune.

07:00:04.600 --> 07:00:06.600
[Guest 1]: Because sometimes the tonality obviously I don't end up getting.

07:00:06.600 --> 07:00:08.600
[Guest 1]: But they respond to the tune.

07:00:08.600 --> 07:00:10.600
[Guest 1]: If I can do it.

07:00:10.600 --> 07:00:12.600
[Guest 1]: And the story used to be that you know.

07:00:12.600 --> 07:00:14.600
[Guest 1]: Just like the stars are gathered in this hall.

07:00:14.600 --> 07:00:16.600
[Guest 1]: So it would be at a conference.

07:00:16.600 --> 07:00:18.600
[Guest 1]: Or if it's a show.

07:00:18.600 --> 07:00:20.600
[Guest 1]: All these lovely people are gathered in this hall.

07:00:20.600 --> 07:00:22.600
[Guest 1]: Just like that once there was an auditorium.

07:00:22.600 --> 07:00:24.600
[Guest 1]: Which was filled with a great audience.

07:00:24.600 --> 07:00:26.600
[Guest 1]: But there was another auditorium unfortunately next to it.

07:00:26.600 --> 07:00:28.600
[Guest 1]: Which was filled with children.

07:00:28.600 --> 07:00:30.600
[Guest 1]: And all these musical stars had to go and collect their awards.

07:00:30.600 --> 07:00:32.600
[Guest 1]: At this galaxy of stars.

07:00:32.600 --> 07:00:34.600
[Guest 1]: But they ended up at the children's auditorium.

07:00:34.600 --> 07:00:36.600
[Guest 1]: And when the curtain went up.

07:00:36.600 --> 07:00:38.600
[Guest 1]: And they said boss we are entertainers.

07:00:38.600 --> 07:00:40.600
[Guest 1]: And we have to entertain.

07:00:40.600 --> 07:00:42.600
[Guest 1]: So the children don't know our lyrics.

07:00:42.600 --> 07:00:44.600
[Guest 1]: But they must know Jekyll and Hyde.

07:00:44.600 --> 07:00:46.600
[Guest 1]: So we will come in our own style and perform Jekyll and Hyde.

07:00:46.600 --> 07:00:48.600
[Guest 1]: So I will say 2-3.

07:00:48.600 --> 07:00:50.600
[Guest 1]: After that you can request.

07:00:50.600 --> 07:00:52.600
[Guest 1]: So various singers.

07:00:52.600 --> 07:00:54.600
[Guest 1]: And Vikram you can always give us your requests.

07:00:54.600 --> 07:00:56.600
[Guest 1]: As we go along.

07:00:56.600 --> 07:00:58.600
[Guest 1]: So the first person who got up to do Jekyll and Hyde was Elvis Presley.

07:00:58.600 --> 07:01:00.600
[Guest 1]: And Elvis reached up on stage.

07:01:00.600 --> 07:01:02.600
[Guest 1]: And this is what he did.

07:01:02.600 --> 07:01:04.600
[Unknown]: He said.

07:01:04.600 --> 07:01:06.600
[Unknown]: Jekyll and Hyde.

07:01:06.600 --> 07:01:08.600
[Unknown]: They both went up the hill.

07:01:08.600 --> 07:01:10.600
[Unknown]: And Jackie fell down.

07:01:10.600 --> 07:01:12.600
[Unknown]: Until she broke her crown.

07:01:12.600 --> 07:01:14.600
[Unknown]: It was Jekyll and Hyde.

07:01:14.600 --> 07:01:16.600
[Unknown]: Went up the hill.

07:01:16.600 --> 07:01:18.600
[Unknown]: Shooby doo bop doo.

07:01:18.600 --> 07:01:20.600
[Unknown]: Dee da da doo.

07:01:24.600 --> 07:01:26.600
[Guest 1]: So Elvis would be the first person.

07:01:26.600 --> 07:01:28.600
[Guest 1]: Who would do it.

07:01:28.600 --> 07:01:30.600
[Guest 1]: And the next person who came on.

07:01:30.600 --> 07:01:32.600
[Guest 1]: Was Stevie Wonder.

07:01:32.600 --> 07:01:34.600
[Guest 1]: Stevie Wonder.

07:01:34.600 --> 07:01:36.600
[Guest 1]: Had this big grin on his face.

07:01:36.600 --> 07:01:38.600
[Guest 1]: At every point.

07:01:38.600 --> 07:01:40.600
[Guest 1]: And he came on.

07:01:40.600 --> 07:01:42.600
[Unknown]: And this is what he did with Jekyll and Hyde.

07:01:42.600 --> 07:01:44.600
[Unknown]: While Jekyll and Hyde.

07:01:44.600 --> 07:01:46.600
[Unknown]: Went up the hill.

07:01:46.600 --> 07:01:48.600
[Unknown]: And Jackie fell down.

07:01:48.600 --> 07:01:50.600
[Unknown]: Until she broke her crown.

07:01:50.600 --> 07:01:52.600
[Unknown]: And Jekyll and Hyde.

07:01:52.600 --> 07:01:54.600
[Unknown]: Went up the hill.

07:01:54.600 --> 07:01:56.600
[Unknown]: It was Jekyll and Hyde.

07:01:56.600 --> 07:01:58.600
[Unknown]: Shooby doo bop doo.

07:01:58.600 --> 07:02:00.600
[Unknown]: Dee da da doo.

07:02:00.600 --> 07:02:02.600
[Unknown]: Went up the hill.

07:02:02.600 --> 07:02:04.600
[Unknown]: And Jackie fell down.

07:02:04.600 --> 07:02:06.600
[Unknown]: Until she broke her crown.

07:02:06.600 --> 07:02:08.600
[Unknown]: And Jekyll and Hyde.

07:02:08.600 --> 07:02:10.600
[Unknown]: Went up the hill.

07:02:10.600 --> 07:02:12.600
[Unknown]: And this is what he did with Jackie and Hyde.

07:02:12.600 --> 07:02:14.600
[Unknown]: While Jekyll and Hyde.

07:02:14.600 --> 07:02:16.600
[Unknown]: Went up the hill.

07:02:16.600 --> 07:02:18.600
[Unknown]: And this is what he did with Jekyll and Hyde.

07:02:18.600 --> 07:02:20.600
[Unknown]: While Jekyll and Hyde.

07:02:20.600 --> 07:02:22.600
[Unknown]: Went up the hill.

07:02:22.600 --> 07:02:24.600
[Unknown]: It was Jekyll and Hyde.

07:02:24.600 --> 07:02:26.600
[Unknown]: Shooby doo bop doo.

07:02:26.600 --> 07:02:28.600
[Unknown]: Dee da da doo.

07:02:28.600 --> 07:02:33.800
[Unknown]: bottom of my heart. Amazing.

07:02:34.680 --> 07:02:39.960
[Guest 1]: There was a famous performer from Bihar, his original name was Michael Al Jackson.

07:02:40.600 --> 07:02:44.160
[Guest 1]: He didn't get a visa to the American embassy, he came back as Michael Jackson.

07:02:44.680 --> 07:02:48.960
[Guest 1]: And I used to crack one very bad joke, which I'm about to do in a minute here,

07:02:49.400 --> 07:02:52.600
[Guest 1]: which was about his favorite song being an Elton John song,

07:02:52.880 --> 07:02:56.960
[Guest 1]: don't let the sun go, whatever. So anyway, so I will not go there.

07:02:56.960 --> 07:03:02.080
[Guest 1]: But anyway, so, so, so basically this was Michael Jackson got up and he did his version.

07:03:02.080 --> 07:03:02.360
[Guest 1]: He said,

07:03:04.480 --> 07:03:14.240
[Unknown]: Well, Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water and Jack fell down and he broke his crown.

07:03:14.920 --> 07:03:20.280
[Unknown]: And Jill came tumbling after, and Jill came tumbling after, Jill came tumbling after.

07:03:20.280 --> 07:03:26.800
[Unknown]: Jack, Jack, come on, everybody is Jack and the whole world wants to tell you right now that the guy fell down.

07:03:26.800 --> 07:03:29.840
[Guest 1]: It's Jack. So Michael Jackson happened.

07:03:32.840 --> 07:03:37.680
[Guest 1]: So there was Khalid who would have his sister crush and therefore would sing,

07:03:38.000 --> 07:03:42.120
[Unknown]: Jack and Jill went up the hill, Jack fell down and he broke his crown.

07:03:42.400 --> 07:03:48.480
[Unknown]: Jill came tumbling after Jack, then Jill, then Jill, they both went up the hill.

07:03:48.480 --> 07:03:52.840
[Unknown]: And Jill, they both went up the hill.

07:03:52.840 --> 07:03:57.040
[Guest 1]: And Shankar Mahadevan, who was going breathless in those days, and he said,

07:04:27.040 --> 07:04:45.640
[Unknown]: Jack and Jill went up, they both went up the hill, Jack and Jill went up, they went up

07:04:45.640 --> 07:04:56.080
[Unknown]: the hill too, together, together, together, together, Jack fell down and Jill, Jill she

07:04:56.080 --> 07:05:03.080
[Unknown]: broke her crown, and finally dollar mehndi, dollar mehndi because they used to earn in

07:05:03.080 --> 07:05:15.480
[Unknown]: dollars, they used to sing on the mehndi ceremony, Raina, Raina, Jack, Jack and, Jack, Jack and,

07:05:15.480 --> 07:05:21.520
[Guest 1]: Jack, Jack and Jillela, Jack, Jack and, Jack, Jack and, Jack, Jack and Jillela, Jack now

07:05:21.520 --> 07:05:28.620
[Guest 1]: you know, He went up there and, Jill she fell down and Jack broke his crown, Jack now.

07:05:28.620 --> 07:05:35.320
[Unknown]: Jack, Jack and, Jack, Jack and, Jack, Jack and Jillela, Jack, Jack and, Jack, Jack and,

07:05:35.320 --> 07:05:42.680
[Guest 1]: Jack, Jack and Jillela, Jack and Jill went up, they both went up the hill, up the hill,

07:05:42.680 --> 07:05:47.560
[Unknown]: Up that hill, up that hill, up that hill, up that hill.

07:05:47.560 --> 07:05:50.480
[Unknown]: Jack fell down, Jill broke her crown,

07:05:50.480 --> 07:05:54.280
[Unknown]: and they came tumbling after.

07:05:54.280 --> 07:05:57.560
[Unknown]: After, after, after, after, after, after, after.

07:05:57.560 --> 07:06:00.640
[Unknown]: Tunak, tunak, tunak, tunak, tunak, tunak, tunak, tunak, tunak.

07:06:00.640 --> 07:06:04.160
[Amit Varma]: Amazing, amazing, amazing.

07:06:04.160 --> 07:06:06.520
[Guest 1]: So Jack and Jill's infinite versions

07:06:06.520 --> 07:06:09.920
[Guest 1]: played until the audience got tired, or we got tired.

07:06:09.920 --> 07:06:12.920
[Guest 1]: Or you could have said, this gentleman, Malaika Arora.

07:06:12.920 --> 07:06:19.400
[Unknown]: These are old stage tactics.

07:06:19.400 --> 07:06:22.000
[Unknown]: What all have we done?

07:06:22.000 --> 07:06:23.560
[Guest 1]: We made a good Christmas for it.

07:06:23.560 --> 07:06:24.720
[Guest 1]: We had a party for New Year's.

07:06:24.720 --> 07:06:25.560
[Amit Varma]: Everything is done.

07:06:25.560 --> 07:06:27.080
[Amit Varma]: Amazing, everything is done for me.

07:06:27.080 --> 07:06:28.960
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, I've taken enough of your time.

07:06:28.960 --> 07:06:32.920
[Amit Varma]: So I think I can finally begin to let you go.

07:06:32.920 --> 07:06:35.320
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, if for people watching this,

07:06:35.320 --> 07:06:36.760
[Amit Varma]: especially young people watching this,

07:06:36.760 --> 07:06:39.560
[Amit Varma]: given that we are old fogies, however much you may disagree,

07:06:39.560 --> 07:06:42.160
[Amit Varma]: Roshan, if you had to, no, I'm kidding.

07:06:42.160 --> 07:06:45.080
[Amit Varma]: But if you had to sort of, from all the things

07:06:45.080 --> 07:06:46.560
[Amit Varma]: that you've learned in your life,

07:06:46.560 --> 07:06:50.000
[Amit Varma]: give advice to young people today, you know,

07:06:50.000 --> 07:06:51.600
[Amit Varma]: what are the, like, if you had to talk

07:06:51.600 --> 07:06:53.760
[Amit Varma]: to a young Roshan, who's 20 years old,

07:06:53.760 --> 07:06:56.280
[Amit Varma]: what advice would you give him?

07:06:56.280 --> 07:06:57.880
[Guest 1]: Honestly, to a young Roshan, though,

07:06:57.880 --> 07:06:59.480
[Guest 1]: it would be do exactly what you did.

07:06:59.480 --> 07:07:03.000
[Guest 1]: Because frankly, I had a very, very fulfilled life.

07:07:03.000 --> 07:07:06.000
[Guest 1]: But if it is to young people at large,

07:07:06.000 --> 07:07:09.840
[Guest 1]: as I said that there is a lot of hope we all

07:07:09.840 --> 07:07:12.640
[Guest 1]: have in this generation for the simple reason

07:07:12.640 --> 07:07:18.120
[Guest 1]: that remain unafraid, keep experimenting, keep doing.

07:07:18.120 --> 07:07:22.560
[Guest 1]: You know, in this digital ether, in this digital world,

07:07:22.560 --> 07:07:26.800
[Guest 1]: that virtual like, that virtual heart, that virtual share

07:07:26.800 --> 07:07:29.280
[Guest 1]: is a small dopamine hit maybe for you

07:07:29.280 --> 07:07:30.360
[Guest 1]: and for others around you.

07:07:30.360 --> 07:07:33.120
[Guest 1]: But if it doesn't get translated into action,

07:07:33.120 --> 07:07:36.320
[Guest 1]: it's a tale full of sound and fury signifying nothing

07:07:36.320 --> 07:07:38.040
[Guest 1]: almost by the end of it.

07:07:38.040 --> 07:07:41.920
[Guest 1]: If you really want to go, there is no better,

07:07:41.920 --> 07:07:45.160
[Guest 1]: there is no generation which will be as empowered as you,

07:07:45.160 --> 07:07:48.600
[Guest 1]: no generation that will have as many tools as you,

07:07:48.600 --> 07:07:51.920
[Guest 1]: no generation where the ability to break down

07:07:51.920 --> 07:07:55.400
[Guest 1]: all those old guardrails, you know,

07:07:55.400 --> 07:07:57.360
[Guest 1]: all those guardrails you can break so easily.

07:07:57.360 --> 07:07:59.960
[Guest 1]: We had to knock on doors of All India Radio,

07:07:59.960 --> 07:08:04.160
[Guest 1]: stand outside film studios, read 20 scripts, do auditions,

07:08:04.160 --> 07:08:05.600
[Guest 1]: do all of those things.

07:08:05.600 --> 07:08:07.720
[Guest 1]: And I did a very small share of it,

07:08:07.720 --> 07:08:10.480
[Guest 1]: but then thankfully the success was incremental.

07:08:10.480 --> 07:08:12.080
[Guest 1]: But do that.

07:08:12.080 --> 07:08:17.440
[Guest 1]: Also in the initial years, work for experience, not for money.

07:08:17.440 --> 07:08:20.240
[Guest 1]: I know this sounds very easy from where I'm sitting today.

07:08:20.240 --> 07:08:22.760
[Guest 1]: But I can tell you about 50% of the jobs

07:08:22.760 --> 07:08:26.040
[Guest 1]: I did in my first seven or eight years of working,

07:08:26.040 --> 07:08:28.760
[Guest 1]: and maybe even more than that, were done for experience,

07:08:28.760 --> 07:08:30.560
[Guest 1]: not for money.

07:08:30.560 --> 07:08:36.120
[Guest 1]: They gave me all the skills I have to make the money.

07:08:36.120 --> 07:08:40.760
[Guest 1]: They gave me all the bad experiences in small doses,

07:08:40.760 --> 07:08:44.360
[Guest 1]: not being paid, not signing contracts, being cheated,

07:08:44.360 --> 07:08:49.040
[Guest 1]: being stood up at an event, having to suddenly, you know,

07:08:49.040 --> 07:08:51.800
[Guest 1]: see be replaced by another person, all of those things.

07:08:51.800 --> 07:08:56.640
[Guest 1]: Everything, those small hurts, because till the age of 25,

07:08:56.640 --> 07:08:59.880
[Guest 1]: maybe your brain is still learning how to process

07:08:59.880 --> 07:09:03.400
[Guest 1]: and how to react and respond to things.

07:09:03.400 --> 07:09:05.720
[Guest 1]: Delve into as many experiences as you can.

07:09:05.720 --> 07:09:08.120
[Guest 1]: Life is there to make money.

07:09:08.120 --> 07:09:12.560
[Guest 1]: Don't fall for this trap of money today, money today.

07:09:12.560 --> 07:09:14.720
[Guest 1]: Don't look at only the success charts.

07:09:14.720 --> 07:09:16.280
[Guest 1]: I genuinely feel that there needs

07:09:16.280 --> 07:09:19.360
[Guest 1]: to be a failure slash stumbling chart as well.

07:09:19.360 --> 07:09:22.480
[Guest 1]: And every stumble is a learning.

07:09:22.480 --> 07:09:25.360
[Guest 1]: Go for those, because there is so much to do that.

07:09:25.360 --> 07:09:31.160
[Guest 1]: Along the way, don't forget the people who build you, ever.

07:09:31.160 --> 07:09:33.800
[Guest 1]: Don't forget your family, ever.

07:09:33.800 --> 07:09:37.920
[Guest 1]: Because in the end, they will be around you.

07:09:37.920 --> 07:09:38.960
[Guest 1]: Whatever you do.

07:09:38.960 --> 07:09:40.240
[Guest 1]: I'm going to end with a line that I just

07:09:40.240 --> 07:09:42.960
[Guest 1]: heard in Tathastu from Zakir, because I absolutely adore it.

07:09:42.960 --> 07:09:47.600
[Guest 1]: He turned and said, professional loss is temporary.

07:09:47.600 --> 07:09:50.120
[Guest 1]: Personal loss is permanent.

07:09:50.120 --> 07:09:53.600
[Guest 1]: Just make sure that you give enough time to those.

07:09:53.600 --> 07:09:55.360
[Guest 1]: And there's another line from his show.

07:09:55.360 --> 07:09:59.120
[Guest 1]: I think he's a soothsayer for this generation to a large degree.

07:09:59.120 --> 07:10:01.960
[Guest 1]: He says, don't ruin anyone's magic.

07:10:01.960 --> 07:10:02.600
[Guest 1]: There's no need.

07:10:02.600 --> 07:10:04.520
[Guest 1]: Be gentle.

07:10:04.520 --> 07:10:06.080
[Guest 1]: Everybody has had a bad day.

07:10:06.080 --> 07:10:07.000
[Guest 1]: Everybody's done that.

07:10:07.000 --> 07:10:10.120
[Guest 1]: If you can, if you can find that empathy within you,

07:10:10.120 --> 07:10:12.360
[Guest 1]: that's all that everybody needs.

07:10:12.360 --> 07:10:13.120
[Guest 1]: Beautiful words.

07:10:13.120 --> 07:10:14.720
[Guest 2]: Amazing.

07:10:14.720 --> 07:10:16.480
[Guest 2]: Don't ruin it.

07:10:16.480 --> 07:10:19.560
[Guest 2]: One thing I've learned is don't give advice to youngsters.

07:10:19.560 --> 07:10:25.240
[Guest 2]: Actually, they may not take it.

07:10:25.240 --> 07:10:29.760
[Guest 2]: But having said that, I would have taken Roshan's advice to myself

07:10:29.760 --> 07:10:33.040
[Guest 2]: if I was young, is that I don't want to change anything, especially

07:10:33.040 --> 07:10:38.480
[Guest 2]: my mental state and the fact that I live without any goal and stuff like that.

07:10:38.480 --> 07:10:43.120
[Guest 2]: But still, I'm curious enough to, I think curiosity is the fundamental thing.

07:10:43.120 --> 07:10:46.760
[Guest 2]: If you're curious, a lot of your anxieties, your stress kind of

07:10:46.760 --> 07:10:49.600
[Guest 2]: gets canceled because you are anyway in the moment.

07:10:49.600 --> 07:10:51.960
[Guest 2]: You're trying to seek out of life and others.

07:10:51.960 --> 07:10:55.760
[Guest 2]: And I would have taken one piece of advice from Roshan to my younger self,

07:10:55.760 --> 07:10:59.440
[Guest 2]: that yes, you live the life that you have chosen to in the way you are doing

07:10:59.440 --> 07:11:03.480
[Guest 2]: right now, but just get a little more execution friendly

07:11:03.480 --> 07:11:06.800
[Guest 2]: and put out more creative in the universe so that,

07:11:06.800 --> 07:11:10.800
[Guest 2]: and take it to the logical conclusion and just don't get away from it.

07:11:10.800 --> 07:11:12.400
[Guest 2]: Beyond that, nothing.

07:11:12.400 --> 07:11:16.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I would just say that I disagree with you in the one sense.

07:11:16.440 --> 07:11:20.000
[Amit Varma]: In the context of my own life, that I would do things differently.

07:11:20.000 --> 07:11:21.200
[Amit Varma]: I would do a lot differently.

07:11:21.200 --> 07:11:23.000
[Amit Varma]: And I think my advice comes from there.

07:11:23.000 --> 07:11:25.880
[Amit Varma]: Advice number one is respect the passing of time.

07:11:25.880 --> 07:11:27.880
[Amit Varma]: Time passes quicker than you know it.

07:11:27.880 --> 07:11:30.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, there's a saying, the days are long, the years are short.

07:11:30.720 --> 07:11:35.240
[Amit Varma]: The years go by before you even realize how fast they are moving.

07:11:35.240 --> 07:11:36.320
[Amit Varma]: So respect that time.

07:11:36.320 --> 07:11:38.360
[Amit Varma]: Don't waste any of it.

07:11:38.360 --> 07:11:41.280
[Amit Varma]: I would also say bet on yourself, right?

07:11:41.280 --> 07:11:43.360
[Amit Varma]: If you grow yourself.

07:11:43.360 --> 07:11:47.760
[Amit Varma]: Kids today are so fortunate, not just kids, we today are so fortunate

07:11:47.760 --> 07:11:49.840
[Amit Varma]: that we live in a world where you can learn anything.

07:11:49.840 --> 07:11:53.800
[Amit Varma]: You can go online and you can pick up any skill and become good at it.

07:11:53.800 --> 07:11:56.640
[Amit Varma]: So respect time, bet on yourself.

07:11:56.640 --> 07:11:59.080
[Amit Varma]: You know, compound yourself, as Sam Altman says.

07:11:59.080 --> 07:12:02.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, always try to figure out ways in which you are getting better

07:12:02.680 --> 07:12:05.400
[Amit Varma]: at something and ask yourself every day, every week,

07:12:05.400 --> 07:12:06.840
[Amit Varma]: what have I learned this week?

07:12:06.840 --> 07:12:08.480
[Amit Varma]: How am I better?

07:12:08.480 --> 07:12:11.640
[Amit Varma]: Also, look within yourself for happiness, not outside.

07:12:11.640 --> 07:12:15.560
[Amit Varma]: I think too many people spend too much time worrying about what other people

07:12:15.560 --> 07:12:18.120
[Amit Varma]: think of them, where really nobody's thinking of anybody else.

07:12:18.120 --> 07:12:20.320
[Amit Varma]: We've all got our heads up our own asses, right?

07:12:20.320 --> 07:12:23.280
[Amit Varma]: So just, you know, look within for happiness.

07:12:23.280 --> 07:12:25.760
[Amit Varma]: Validation doesn't really matter.

07:12:25.760 --> 07:12:29.080
[Amit Varma]: And the words from James Clear and Atomic Habits

07:12:29.880 --> 07:12:33.720
[Amit Varma]: sort of ring really true to me when he says everything you do today

07:12:34.000 --> 07:12:35.920
[Amit Varma]: will impact your future self.

07:12:35.920 --> 07:12:37.720
[Amit Varma]: And I think that's supremely important.

07:12:37.720 --> 07:12:42.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, I'm very angry at the young me because he didn't compound himself

07:12:42.000 --> 07:12:43.600
[Amit Varma]: and he wasted too much time.

07:12:43.600 --> 07:12:45.640
[Amit Varma]: And I think that impacted his future self.

07:12:46.000 --> 07:12:50.520
[Amit Varma]: And what I think we all have to remember is that everything you do today

07:12:50.680 --> 07:12:52.400
[Amit Varma]: builds the person you are tomorrow.

07:12:52.400 --> 07:12:53.320
[Amit Varma]: Think of that person.

07:12:53.320 --> 07:12:54.880
[Amit Varma]: Be compassionate towards him.

07:12:54.880 --> 07:12:57.120
[Amit Varma]: And this doesn't mean that you work, work, work all the time.

07:12:57.360 --> 07:12:59.080
[Amit Varma]: Leisure is also great.

07:12:59.080 --> 07:13:00.720
[Amit Varma]: Being in the moment is great.

07:13:00.720 --> 07:13:03.040
[Amit Varma]: Listening to a piece of music and giving into it

07:13:03.040 --> 07:13:05.640
[Amit Varma]: and not looking at what your calendar says is also great.

07:13:05.640 --> 07:13:10.880
[Amit Varma]: But the point is that overall, you've just got to sort of think about that.

07:13:10.880 --> 07:13:12.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, there are many ways.

07:13:12.040 --> 07:13:15.680
[Amit Varma]: Like one good metric is that if you think of your ideal self,

07:13:16.040 --> 07:13:18.960
[Amit Varma]: what is the perfect version of you doing that you don't do?

07:13:19.280 --> 07:13:22.440
[Amit Varma]: And what is a perfect version of you not doing that you do?

07:13:22.720 --> 07:13:24.800
[Amit Varma]: And if you just, you know, do a journal entry.

07:13:24.800 --> 07:13:27.960
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, writing a journal every day is also great advice that I would give.

07:13:28.360 --> 07:13:30.760
[Amit Varma]: And I would say that, you know, make that your first journal entry

07:13:30.760 --> 07:13:34.320
[Amit Varma]: and write about, you know, that ideal self.

07:13:34.320 --> 07:13:38.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, what are they doing that you are not and what are they not doing

07:13:38.640 --> 07:13:40.080
[Amit Varma]: that you are doing?

07:13:40.080 --> 07:13:42.320
[Amit Varma]: And I think they would also listen to this podcast.

07:13:42.320 --> 07:13:43.280
[Amit Varma]: So it's fine.

07:13:43.280 --> 07:13:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Basically, what you're saying is find your own Baljeet.

07:13:48.280 --> 07:13:51.120
[Amit Varma]: Find your own inner Baljeet and make him your Bhayna.

07:13:53.120 --> 07:13:53.720
[Guest 1]: That's true.

07:13:53.720 --> 07:13:56.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, I sometimes, when I start, he says to me,

07:13:56.640 --> 07:14:03.320
[Guest 1]: you know, he says that you have your Urdu, English, Kashm-Kashm, whatever.

07:14:03.320 --> 07:14:06.320
[Guest 1]: Kashm-Kashm, whatever, whatever, you know, he exploits it a lot.

07:14:33.320 --> 07:14:46.920
[Guest 1]: Right, I was just forgetting two lines in between because it's a, it just,

07:14:46.920 --> 07:14:51.120
[Guest 1]: it's that whole thing of turning and saying that it takes a lot of effort.

07:14:51.120 --> 07:14:53.720
[Guest 1]: And I, you know, how I keep talking about this thing of saying,

07:14:53.720 --> 07:14:57.160
[Guest 1]: karo, karo, karo, karo, you know, karna bahut zaruri hai.

07:14:57.160 --> 07:15:00.160
[Guest 1]: And, you know, and doing to that extent, doing to that extreme,

07:15:00.160 --> 07:15:05.640
[Guest 1]: that pinnacle is, it gets, you know, it gets smaller as you go there.

07:15:05.640 --> 07:15:09.640
[Guest 1]: But if you want to reach there, you have to put in that much effort.

07:15:09.640 --> 07:15:16.640
[Guest 1]: And what you said, what he said as a joke or whatever, ultimately, I think it's the same.

07:15:16.640 --> 07:15:20.640
[Guest 1]: That there's so much to do in life, do it.

07:15:20.640 --> 07:15:22.640
[Guest 1]: You know, go and do it.

07:15:22.640 --> 07:15:25.640
[Guest 1]: You said, do it each day, compound it, do that over and over.

07:15:25.640 --> 07:15:26.640
[Amit Varma]: Bias for action.

07:15:26.640 --> 07:15:29.640
[Guest 1]: Bias for action is something that I just want to reiterate that or whatever.

07:15:29.640 --> 07:15:30.640
[Guest 2]: I wish I had forgotten it.

07:15:30.640 --> 07:15:34.640
[Guest 2]: I was about to spit blood and he said, why is he promoting anemia?

07:15:34.640 --> 07:15:36.640
[Unknown]: Wow, wow.

07:15:36.640 --> 07:15:41.640
[Guest 1]: I mean, you know, one of those, one of those…

07:15:41.640 --> 07:15:44.640
[Guest 2]: However difficult it is, try to find your why.

07:15:44.640 --> 07:15:46.640
[Amit Varma]: It's very difficult.

07:15:46.640 --> 07:15:48.640
[Guest 2]: Do you need to find a why, Vikram?

07:15:48.640 --> 07:15:49.640
[Guest 2]: What is your why?

07:15:49.640 --> 07:15:52.640
[Guest 2]: See, why means whether it is goal setting or what in traditional terms.

07:15:52.640 --> 07:16:00.640
[Guest 2]: But if you get a little meaning that you have to do this, then I have seen that psychological issues are also solved a lot,

07:16:00.640 --> 07:16:02.640
[Guest 2]: which are likely to come in the younger generation.

07:16:02.640 --> 07:16:07.640
[Guest 2]: For that matter, even just, I mean, to this thing, even when my mother was unwell,

07:16:07.640 --> 07:16:12.640
[Guest 2]: when I, she has lived her life, she has taught me the things.

07:16:12.640 --> 07:16:16.640
[Guest 2]: But the moment I triggered that, you know, you should do this and that will this thing,

07:16:16.640 --> 07:16:18.640
[Guest 2]: suddenly her healing process got better.

07:16:18.640 --> 07:16:24.640
[Guest 2]: I know, I don't mean to say the why is a very philosophical construct about your existence in the universe,

07:16:24.640 --> 07:16:30.640
[Guest 2]: but it is that small, that I should do this, that kind of solves a lot of problems before.

07:16:30.640 --> 07:16:31.640
[Amit Varma]: What's your why?

07:16:31.640 --> 07:16:34.640
[Guest 2]: That's what I'm still trying to find.

07:16:34.640 --> 07:16:37.640
[Amit Varma]: It changes.

07:16:37.640 --> 07:16:41.640
[Amit Varma]: Let's hope that in 2023, we all find our why's, all three of us and everyone listening in.

07:16:41.640 --> 07:16:44.640
[Amit Varma]: So thank you guys for your company today.

07:16:44.640 --> 07:16:45.640
[Guest 1]: Thank you.

07:16:45.640 --> 07:16:46.640
[Unknown]: Thank you.

07:16:46.640 --> 07:16:48.640
[Guest 1]: Jai Bilao.

07:17:16.640 --> 07:17:18.640
[Amit Varma]: Jai Bilao.
