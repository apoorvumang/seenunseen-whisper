00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
[Amit Varma]: The point Lipman made in that chapter was that all of us have a picture of the world in our heads

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
[Amit Varma]: and that picture can never correspond to the actual world exactly or even to other such pictures inside other people's heads

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
[Amit Varma]: because the world is too complicated.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
[Amit Varma]: We are a storytelling species and all of us build or subscribe to simple narratives that help make sense of a complex world.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
[Amit Varma]: This is the necessary mechanism and there's nothing wrong in this.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
[Amit Varma]: However, in modern times when our means of getting news and knowledge are widely dispersed

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
[Amit Varma]: and the political discourse is so polarized, it means that these narratives diverge furiously

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
[Amit Varma]: more than it used to in the past when the media was monolithic and there was some sort of broad consensus on the truth.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
[Amit Varma]: And once we build a narrative in our heads about the world, we only accept news and information that conforms to this narrative.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
[Amit Varma]: There is too much cognitive dissonance otherwise, too much hard work for us to do to keep modifying that picture in our heads.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
[Amit Varma]: At some level, this explains the attractiveness of fake news.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Anything that reinforces our worldview is legit, everything else is fake.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
[Amit Varma]: You might think that this is fine, let people believe what they believe, but fake news has real consequences.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Rumors can kill people, decide elections, tear communities apart and spread cancer in our society

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
[Amit Varma]: and it has never been as much of a threat as it is today, enabled and turbocharged by technology.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Something must be done.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bhadma.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
[Amit Varma]: My guest on the show today is someone I've admired for a long time.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
[Amit Varma]: Pratik Sinha runs Alt News, an organization that has made it a mission to bust fake news from all sides of the political spectrum.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
[Amit Varma]: It's been fascinating for me to watch from a distance how Alt News has evolved as a resistance movement against falsehood.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
[Amit Varma]: And I'm very pleased to have finally gotten Pratik to agree to come on my show.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
[Amit Varma]: But before I cut to my conversation with him, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
[Amit Varma]: This episode of The Seen and The Unseen is brought to you by Storytel.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
[Amit Varma]: The book I want to recommend today is Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Steven Pinker was a guest on an episode of The Seen and The Unseen.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
[Amit Varma]: You can check that out in the archives page.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Pratik, welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Pratik, tell me a little bit about yourself. Where were you born? Where did you grow up? What's your background like?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
[Guest]: I was born in Ahmedabad. I did my schooling in Ahmedabad.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
[Guest]: Did my engineering from Bangalore. That was 1999 to 2003.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
[Guest]: After that, I worked in Bangalore for three years.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
[Guest]: I worked only for startups through my career as a software engineer.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
[Guest]: In 2006, I went to the U.S. sometime in mid-2006, I think 2007.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
[Guest]: And then till 2010, I was in the U.S.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
[Guest]: Then 2010, I moved to Vietnam. And then 2010 to 2013, I was in Vietnam.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
[Guest]: And then 2013 is when I came back to Ahmedabad.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
[Guest]: And that is essentially where some of the political journey started.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
[Guest]: My politicization started, not the political journey.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
[Amit Varma]: But in a sense, you know, because of by virtue of the family that you're born in

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
[Amit Varma]: that your parents stayed, and I want to discuss that with you as well.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
[Amit Varma]: You were politically aware from a long while before that, right?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
[Guest]: Definitely. The political awareness was right since I was a child, you know,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
[Guest]: I was forced to watch the same news on multiple channels again and again.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
[Guest]: You know, because, you know, that is the time when cable TV came in, multiple channels came in.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
[Guest]: They're always watching news, you know, there was no soap operas there.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
[Guest]: And all the discussion on dinner table was always about politics.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
[Guest]: So, yes, I was very much politically aware, connected.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
[Guest]: But it's just that, you know, when you're away, then you look at things from a distance,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
[Guest]: you're not actively involved. But once I came back to Ahmedabad in 2013,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
[Guest]: and that is the time we started a website called Truth of Gujarat.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
[Guest]: And it was also a time when my father got cancer.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
[Guest]: So he was homebound, and both my parents were homebound.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
[Guest]: My mom had also retired by that point of time.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
[Guest]: And the three of us spent a lot of time together in those nine months till my father passed away.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
[Guest]: And that is when I sort of got a lot of dump of knowledge,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
[Guest]: because we were all together, you know, sitting in a room, nothing to do.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
[Guest]: So we did a lot of talking.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
[Guest]: And which is why I often say that, yes, I was politically aware,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
[Guest]: but the real politicization started during that period where Truth of Gujarat started.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
[Guest]: And when, you know, there was a lot of knowledge transfer from my parents to me.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about your dad, because he's obviously someone who's been a very big influence on you

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
[Amit Varma]: and a remarkable activist in his own time, for those who know about that period.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
[Guest]: Tell us a little bit about that.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
[Guest]: So my father was a physicist.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
[Guest]: He did his PhD from an institute called Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
[Guest]: Before that, he's in IIT Kanpur, Passau.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
[Guest]: And he got into union activities.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
[Guest]: There was a class for an employee who was kicked, and he went up to the director to complain about it.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
[Guest]: And that started a movement which started formation.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
[Guest]: I think Physical PRL was the first organization which got a union,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
[Guest]: a scientific institute which got a union in the 70s.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
[Guest]: And then he was a postdoc at that point of time.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
[Guest]: He was terminated, fought the case, lost the case.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
[Guest]: And then eventually he did his LLB in late 80s, became a lawyer.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
[Guest]: A lot of activities at that point of time was concentrated on unions, various industrial unions,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
[Guest]: unions like Atira, NID, IIM, etc.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
[Guest]: Eventually they got into civil rights movements such as housing, education, environment.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
[Guest]: And then when 2002 happened, that is when the organization saw that

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
[Guest]: the people were split along vertical lines, along communal lines,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
[Guest]: which is when Jan Sanghash Manch, which is the primary civil liberties organization,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
[Guest]: they decided to take part in Nanavati Commission.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
[Guest]: Then the spate of fake encounters started in Gujarat,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
[Guest]: and many victims approached Jan Sanghash Manch.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
[Guest]: So we did multiple cases from Saurabh Uddin to Ishwar Jahan to Sadiq Jamal to Tulsi Prajapati.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000
[Guest]: So my father's journey has essentially been from a union activist to a civil rights activist

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
[Guest]: to a lawyer who's fighting the cause of, you know, design communal polarization

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
[Guest]: that was sort of going on in the society.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
[Amit Varma]: And in those days, like for part of that time, of course, you were a software engineer,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
[Amit Varma]: you were away, you went to the US, you went to Vietnam,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
[Amit Varma]: but was there a sense of worry for you that this is dangerous work that my parents are involved in?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Or, I mean, obviously you were supportive, but were you also worried at the same time that,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, why do they have to take such risks? And did it strike you as a kid that,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, your father is involved in all these causes?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
[Amit Varma]: And at one hand, it's obviously romantic that someone is fighting for the downtrodden,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
[Amit Varma]: but on the other hand, did you ever feel that, you know, had he stuck to his physics

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
[Amit Varma]: or had he stuck to a regular career line, it could have made a material difference to your lives?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
[Guest]: No, that thought never occurred.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
[Guest]: There have been times when sort of, you know, papers have been slipped under, you know,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
[Guest]: left at my house with death threats, et cetera, for my father.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
[Guest]: But somehow it never crossed our mind.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
[Guest]: I think in all these things, the support system matters a lot.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
[Guest]: Even now, for example, I have, you know, got a phone call with a death threat,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
[Guest]: like, you know, stop writing or we'll shoot you.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
[Guest]: This happened sometime in 2017.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
[Guest]: But, you know, we often look at people as individuals who are doing something,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
[Guest]: but it's usually the support system around that that matters.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
[Guest]: In case of my father, it was my mom who sort of stood like a rock.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
[Guest]: And she was an activist.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
[Guest]: Her work is not as much recognized because she was a government employee

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
[Guest]: and, you know, she did not come out and open.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
[Guest]: But even now, for example, there was a legal notice from a news channel,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
[Guest]: I wouldn't like the name, when we did a story about them.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
[Guest]: And it was my mother who said that, you know, we are not taking down the story, come what may.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
[Guest]: So it is always about support.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
[Guest]: Whenever you're doing any such work, it is the people around you,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
[Guest]: the support system that matters the most.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about 2013, because you point out about how, you know,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
[Amit Varma]: you had those nine months with your parents and you were sitting and talking a lot.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
[Amit Varma]: You described it as a dump of knowledge.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
[Amit Varma]: And that must have been very important for you,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
[Amit Varma]: because I suppose both of them are sort of giving you all of their insights

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
[Amit Varma]: and learnings through the years.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
[Amit Varma]: What were they like?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
[Amit Varma]: And how did that change the way you looked at India and politics and what was happening?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
[Guest]: So during that period, see, it was not like we were sitting and they were talking.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
[Guest]: That is, the knowledge transfer happened through a project called Truth of Gujarat.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
[Guest]: So on July 2nd, 2013, the Ishwar Jahan Charsheed came out.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
[Guest]: And this was the Charsheed which spoke about Kali Daadi and Safed Daadi

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
[Guest]: giving a go-ahead for the Ishwar Jahan encounter.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
[Guest]: According to Gujarat police's statement given to CBI,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
[Guest]: it was claimed that Kali Daadi was a moniker used for Mr. Amit Shah

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
[Guest]: and Safed Daadi was a moniker used for Mr. Modi.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
[Guest]: And what happened thereafter was that even though there was such a huge revelation,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
[Guest]: the media organizations did not really pick it up.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
[Guest]: You know, it was a huge revelation.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
[Guest]: So I suggested to my parents that let's put all the information online.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
[Guest]: We have a lot of information.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
[Guest]: Let's put it online and that is how Truth of Gujarat came about.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
[Guest]: And because I understood a bit of social media, I understood the youth a little.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
[Guest]: So I said, every article has to be limited to four or five paragraphs

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
[Guest]: because people don't have the attention span per se.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
[Guest]: And that is how we started and it became extremely popular.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000
[Guest]: Because again, even in 2013, that was the only sort of voice of opposition, so to say, in Gujarat.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
[Guest]: So during that process, you know, while writing articles,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
[Guest]: while discussing articles with my father and with my mother,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
[Guest]: that is the time, you know, the conversations happened around these articles.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
[Guest]: And it sort of gave me a lot of insight into their work, you know,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
[Guest]: because they have worked across different issues from working with labor rights.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
[Guest]: So, for example, something as simple as, if you observe, you know,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
[Guest]: if there's a farmer's movement, the labor do not join.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
[Guest]: If there's a labor movement, the farmers do not join.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
[Guest]: You might think outside that there are multiple common causes, but it does not happen.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
[Guest]: People fight for their own causes.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
[Guest]: And you cannot ever say that, why are you not fighting for somebody else's causes?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
[Guest]: So things like that, you know, which otherwise it's difficult to understand and know

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
[Guest]: that why there are so many different sections in the society,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
[Guest]: which are fighting for their own causes.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
[Guest]: But we keep talking about unity, but that does not happen.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
[Guest]: There's a reason for it. They have seen this in their...

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
[Guest]: And again, things like, you know, that if you're in a union,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
[Guest]: you don't talk about who you're voting for, whether you're voting for Congress or BJP.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
[Guest]: They're fighting for a cause.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
[Guest]: They are not there to sort of... They are not political workers.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
[Guest]: They are fighting as laborers.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
[Guest]: So you have to recognize, you know, in what capacity is a certain individual

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
[Guest]: acting at any point in time to understand the outcomes of a movement, etc.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
[Guest]: So those are the things.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
[Guest]: Of course, there's so many things and it's been four or five years.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
[Guest]: My father passed away in 2014.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
[Guest]: But a lot of these small, small things, which I understood in conversations with them.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
[Amit Varma]: Was it during this time or was it earlier?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Or was it something that was building up over time that you made the decision that

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to be a software engineer anymore.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
[Amit Varma]: I want to do this. This is more important.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
[Amit Varma]: What was that process like?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
[Guest]: So the decision was not to be a software engineer.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
[Guest]: The decision... So I was working on various technologies

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
[Guest]: and these were cutting edge technologies.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
[Guest]: But what I realized over time is that none of that is going to reach the common man

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
[Guest]: for a very long time, the sort of stuff that I was working on.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
[Guest]: And this decision actually came around 2016.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
[Guest]: My mother and I, we walked 10 days from Ahmedabad to Una.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
[Guest]: There were four Dalit boys who were flogged in Una.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
[Guest]: The rally was taken out from Ahmedabad to Una.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
[Guest]: This is the rally in which Jignesh Mevani sort of came out as a leader.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
[Guest]: And during this rally, I documented the entire thing through Truth of Gujarat

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
[Guest]: in terms of videos and images.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
[Guest]: The thing was, there was only one person from national media,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
[Guest]: one person from Hindustan Times.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
[Guest]: But otherwise people for the first five, six days had almost entirely ignored this rally.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
[Guest]: And, you know, when I started putting the videos and images

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
[Guest]: and they started getting retweeted and shared massively.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
[Guest]: And then eventually the media came in and it became a big thing.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
[Guest]: So that is the time I realized that what is the power of alternative media?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
[Guest]: And I thought that I had certain skills to put some of my work in alternative media.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
[Guest]: At the same point in time, I was also working on misinformation right since 2013

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
[Guest]: because there was misinformation even in the 2014 elections,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
[Guest]: but at a much, much smaller scale.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
[Guest]: But I was working on that and I could see an increasing trend

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
[Guest]: and especially starting end of 2015, 2016 when Jio came.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
[Guest]: So I could see a trend.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
[Guest]: And I also realized that traditional journalists do not have the skills to deal with this.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
[Guest]: Even though the skills required are, it is not very difficult.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
[Guest]: Even with a five-day training, a lot of traditional journalists will be able to bust

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
[Guest]: at least 70-80% of the things that go out on social media.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
[Guest]: But it is just that they are not trained for it.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
[Guest]: And media organizations, for media organizations, this was not a priority.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
[Guest]: So at that point of time, I thought that, you know, why not use some of my skills

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
[Guest]: and some of the experience that I gained while running Truth of Gujarat and start a portal.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
[Guest]: So the first document that we came up with was in September 2016.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
[Guest]: This was right after Una Rally.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
[Guest]: The first two points in the document as to what, there were multiple points that we had written,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
[Guest]: but the first two points were, number one, debunk misinformation on social media.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
[Guest]: Number two, document people's struggles.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000
[Guest]: And we never ended up doing number two because number two needs finances where,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
[Guest]: so you have to go to a state, you have to know the local language,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
[Guest]: you have to stay, you have to pay for your own lodging, food, etc.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
[Guest]: And we did not have the resources to do that.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
[Guest]: So that is how we started with debunking misinformation.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
[Amit Varma]: So I'm going to take a brief digression here, a couple of digressions.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll come back to this.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
[Amit Varma]: But you've said a few things while you were talking about this,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
[Amit Varma]: which have raised sort of lateral questions in me.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
[Amit Varma]: So just indulge me while we talk about them.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
[Amit Varma]: One of the things is that when you were talking about 2002 and what happened in Gujarat

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
[Amit Varma]: and you used a phrase that there were vertical lines drawn between people.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
[Amit Varma]: And I just want to explore that a bit by which,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm presuming you don't mean horizontal lines,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
[Amit Varma]: which would be differentiating classes or whatever,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
[Amit Varma]: but vertical lines between Hindu and Muslim?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
[Guest]: Not between Hindu and Muslims, between Hindu and Muslims and between Hindus and Hindus.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
[Guest]: So, for example, again, I was not in India at this point of time.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
[Guest]: So all of this is what I've heard from my parents.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
[Guest]: So we had a union and various organizations.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
[Guest]: The city was burning.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
[Guest]: And one of the organizations was close to my house.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
[Guest]: So my parents walked to that place.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
[Guest]: They were having a small meeting.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000
[Guest]: And somebody who was actually used to teach me drawing when I was a kid,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
[Guest]: never successfully could do so.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
[Guest]: But that person, while talking about the riots,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
[Guest]: he stood up and said,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
[Guest]: that these people should be killed.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
[Guest]: So that is what shocked many people in the organization,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
[Guest]: especially my parents, senior people of the organization,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
[Guest]: that we've been running this organization for such a long time,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
[Guest]: but we did not know that this communal hatred was so deep rooted.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
[Guest]: So vertical, yes.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
[Guest]: If you remember 2002 riots,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
[Guest]: if you think of the accused,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
[Guest]: a lot of accused in urban areas were from Dalit communities.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
[Guest]: A lot of accused in the rural areas were from Adivasi communities.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
[Guest]: So essentially it was a project to bring all castes together.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
[Guest]: And it was an unnatural project in the sense that

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
[Guest]: the upper caste and lower caste are supposed to be ideologically opposed.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
[Guest]: You know, one is the, there is, you know,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
[Guest]: Brahmins and Dalits are supposed to be opposed in different ways.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
[Guest]: But this is a project which united everybody.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
[Guest]: Which is why I say that, you know,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
[Guest]: there was a vertical division essentially between Muslims and Hindus,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
[Guest]: but a certain section of Hindus who still believed in certain secular values

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
[Guest]: and even between that.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
[Guest]: And we continue to see that today, this vertical polarization,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
[Guest]: whether it is in our friends, family, et cetera,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
[Amit Varma]: we just completely vertically divided.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
[Amit Varma]: And when you sort of look at, I mean, of course,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
[Amit Varma]: that a whole project of superimposing a broader Hindutva identity

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
[Amit Varma]: across castes and all that is something that continues to this day

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
[Amit Varma]: and might even have been fairly successful so far.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
[Amit Varma]: But when you sort of look at what society in Gujarat was,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
[Amit Varma]: say in 2013, when you came back,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
[Amit Varma]: and what it was earlier when you were still studying

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and when you were still sort of just living there,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
[Amit Varma]: do you think there were fundamental changes within society itself?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
[Amit Varma]: Or do you think that those divisions, fault lines were always there,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
[Amit Varma]: but had now been amplified and given expression?

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
[Guest]: So again, my understanding of this, as I said,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
[Guest]: became better only after 2013.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
[Guest]: But even when I was in school, there were riots.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
[Guest]: So Gujarat has often very, has been a tinderbox, you know,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
[Guest]: even after Babri Masjid demolition,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
[Guest]: there were riots in Ahmedabad and things like that.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
[Guest]: In 1969, there were riots, which are much bigger than 2002.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
[Guest]: And that time there was a Congress government.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
[Guest]: It was not a BJP government.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
[Guest]: And there were many Muslims who were killed.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
[Guest]: So Gujarat has had a history,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
[Guest]: but the polarization has definitely increased over time.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
[Guest]: And this is, for example, if you talk to people the age my mother,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
[Guest]: so my mother often tells me this tale,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
[Guest]: that she's from a Jain family.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
[Guest]: But her father built a house for a friend of theirs,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
[Guest]: a Muslim couple at that age,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
[Guest]: because the family was not accepting.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
[Guest]: So he built, sort of carved out a small portion in their house

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
[Guest]: where that Muslim couple could stay.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
[Guest]: So still that used to happen.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
[Guest]: Now, those kinds of stories are very, very,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
[Guest]: you don't hear those kinds of stories in Gujarat.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
[Guest]: You know, you have Juhapura where all the Muslims stay.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
[Guest]: You know, basically they're ghettos.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
[Guest]: You know, there's so much polarization

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
[Guest]: that there's very little intermingling between different communities,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
[Guest]: except for maybe, you know, at workplaces.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
[Amit Varma]: But cultural intermingling is very, very minimal.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
[Amit Varma]: My next digression is both about politics and strategy

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that you mentioned that

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
[Amit Varma]: when your father would work with unions and so on,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
[Amit Varma]: that one of the characteristics of unions

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
[Amit Varma]: was that all of these people would come together for a specific cause,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
[Amit Varma]: but they wouldn't necessarily be united otherwise.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, I suppose in one way, this can be a bug

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
[Amit Varma]: and you can say that this unity and this organization is wasted

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
[Amit Varma]: because it's only for this cause.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
[Amit Varma]: In another way, it could be a feature because, you know,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
[Amit Varma]: otherwise it would be impossible for them to unite for a cause

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
[Amit Varma]: if you allowed other issues to sort of divide them.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
[Amit Varma]: But quite separate from the matter of how it plays out in terms of unions,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
[Amit Varma]: how does it play out broadly in the political space

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that I would imagine that

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
[Amit Varma]: a coalition of people who are, say, against fake news

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
[Amit Varma]: would be a broader coalition, would have disagreements on many things,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
[Amit Varma]: should be what Congress or ARP or whoever, not vote at all,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
[Amit Varma]: but would have disagreements on many other things,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
[Amit Varma]: but could be united against falsehood.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
[Amit Varma]: So is this sort of a consideration that plays out?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, what do you think about this?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
[Guest]: No, two are different things.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
[Guest]: Fighting for labor rights, etc. is a different matter altogether.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
[Guest]: There you're talking about people, you know, if there's a strike,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
[Guest]: let's say there was a 27-day Saif-e-Kamdaa strike in August 2016,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
[Guest]: right after UNA rally, and which means 27 days of no pay for workers.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
[Guest]: You know, here you're talking about people who are living on a day-to-day basis

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
[Guest]: if 27 days of no pay means disastrous for them, right?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
[Guest]: So for them to now come and join another strike of another organization,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
[Guest]: give up their day pay, is a different matter

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
[Guest]: as opposed to people sitting on social media and extending support.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
[Guest]: So these two cannot be compared.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
[Guest]: You can compare people on social media extending support for,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
[Guest]: let's say, farmer's rights, you know.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
[Guest]: So there'll be urban sections of the population who would extend support

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
[Guest]: for the struggle of farmers, etc.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
[Guest]: That could be a comparison.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
[Guest]: So yes, people do unite on a common cause,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
[Guest]: but people fighting for different issues at the ground level

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
[Guest]: rarely ever unite.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
[Guest]: And you can see that in politics also.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
[Guest]: For example, and this I have again figured out by talking to people.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
[Guest]: So for example, in Karnataka, Congress and JDS have always been

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
[Guest]: opposed to each other, right?

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
[Guest]: And now one day you ask them to come together and form a successful coalition.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
[Guest]: The people on the top may start sort of joining hands,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
[Guest]: but the people who are on the ground who are all...

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
[Guest]: No, this is a different kind of thing.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
[Guest]: Here it is not that the laborers and farmers are against each other,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
[Guest]: but I'm talking about a different kind of phenomenon.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
[Guest]: To think that the Congress and JDS workers will suddenly be happy

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
[Guest]: and working with each other.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
[Guest]: Same with SPBSP in Uttar Pradesh.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
[Guest]: We have seen all these coalitions, these dream coalitions,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
[Guest]: the way media projects it,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
[Guest]: but we have seen this failing again and again and again.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
[Guest]: So there are people who are sort of concentrated on one area,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
[Guest]: and it's very rarely that you see sort of a wide unity of masses.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
[Amit Varma]: And there's a, you know, moving on to a related issue,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
[Amit Varma]: there's a term in public choice theory called the free rider effect,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
[Amit Varma]: where what happens is that there might be many people who care about

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
[Amit Varma]: a particular cause that are affected by it,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
[Amit Varma]: but most of them won't actually do anything concrete to take action

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
[Amit Varma]: or protest it, rather free ride.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, a lot of people who may be against fake news,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
[Amit Varma]: may be bothered by it,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
[Amit Varma]: and maybe they have the capacity to do some of the work themselves.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
[Amit Varma]: They can do the reverse Google searches and whatever,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
[Amit Varma]: they can do all of that.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
[Amit Varma]: But they instead kind of choose to free ride on say an alt news,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
[Amit Varma]: which is sort of doing all this.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
[Amit Varma]: So does it sometimes frustrate you that, look,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
[Amit Varma]: I am embarked on this journey, which is so difficult,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
[Amit Varma]: and there is a struggle and all these people express support,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
[Amit Varma]: but in concrete terms,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
[Amit Varma]: it's almost like there are a few people walking alone.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
[Guest]: It does not frustrate me.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
[Guest]: See, everybody has chosen different aims and ambitions in life.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
[Guest]: For me, alt news is presently a very, very important project.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
[Guest]: You're doing podcasting.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
[Guest]: This is what you are doing.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
[Guest]: Before you're doing a podcast, you're researching several hours.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
[Guest]: Now, in between that, you get some misinformation.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000
[Guest]: I can't expect you to go up and split a video into frames,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
[Guest]: go and look up, oh, this is the video.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
[Guest]: I don't think that is the right expectation.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
[Guest]: So here we have to identify what is the problem.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
[Guest]: The problem is that there are so many means of getting information,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
[Guest]: but there's an easy means of getting information,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
[Guest]: but there's no easy means of figuring out

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
[Guest]: what is the truth behind information.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
[Guest]: If you had something where, you know, you get something,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
[Guest]: you get a video or an image on WhatsApp,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
[Guest]: and if you could upload it to an app and the app would tell you

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
[Guest]: that this is, you know, in one tab, the app gives you an answer

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
[Guest]: that this is probably the fact check

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
[Guest]: or the real story behind this image and video,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
[Guest]: then you're more likely to do it.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
[Guest]: So it is the fact that people are not doing it is a problem

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
[Guest]: that needs to be solved.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
[Guest]: It is not a matter of frustration.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
[Guest]: One has to understand why are people not doing it

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
[Guest]: and what will make people do so.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
[Guest]: You know, what are the tools?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
[Guest]: You know, what does it need for people to go from not doing it

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
[Guest]: to starting to do it?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
[Guest]: So, yeah, it does not frustrate me really.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of go back to your journey with Truth of Gujarat

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
[Amit Varma]: and then later Alt News.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned that there was some fake news already in 2014

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, but it's only in 2016

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
[Amit Varma]: that sort of there was an inflection point.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
[Amit Varma]: What happened in 2016?

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
[Amit Varma]: What confluence of events came together

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
[Amit Varma]: to make fake news a real threat?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
[Guest]: Right.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
[Guest]: So what happened in 2016 was that in November 2016,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
[Guest]: Jio was launched.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
[Guest]: And in anticipation of Jio being launched,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
[Guest]: multiple telecom couriers were already dropping their rates.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
[Guest]: So the pattern that we saw was that end of 2015

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
[Guest]: and beginning of 2016, these websites which came up

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
[Guest]: and which had a lot of content,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
[Guest]: a lot of misinformation and ads.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
[Guest]: So people realized that there was a way to monetize this.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
[Guest]: There's a way that now Internet is reaching

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
[Guest]: farther and farther corners of this country.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
[Guest]: And by writing sensational stuff

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
[Guest]: and getting people to click on ads,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
[Guest]: and a lot of these were semi-porn ads, you know.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
[Guest]: So Tabola kind of ad format,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
[Guest]: you have six to nine boxes at the bottom of the article,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
[Guest]: but a lot of that was essentially nude imagery

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
[Guest]: or semi-nude imagery.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
[Guest]: So that is the pattern that we started seeing.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
[Guest]: And along with that, these increasing forwards, et cetera,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
[Guest]: multiple Facebook pages came up,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
[Guest]: which started putting whatever was on WhatsApp

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
[Guest]: on their Facebook pages.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
[Guest]: So essentially there were more and more people

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
[Guest]: who could be reached on social media,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
[Guest]: and there were certain sections on the society

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
[Guest]: who realized that this is a good way to monetize this.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
[Guest]: That is how it started, according to me.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
[Guest]: And then there were others who saw these people,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
[Guest]: seeing that how easily people were consuming misinformation

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
[Guest]: and saw that there is a political end to this,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
[Guest]: that this can be used actually for a political purpose.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
[Guest]: And that is what started.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
[Guest]: If you remember in November 2016 when demonetization happened,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
[Guest]: this is a different kind of rumor, but just the impact of it.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
[Guest]: A rumor went about that shops are running out of sugar.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
[Guest]: And there were shops which were attacked by civilians

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
[Guest]: just because of the fear that they are running out of sugar.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
[Guest]: Now, somebody might think, you know, running out of sugar,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
[Guest]: why would you attack a shop?

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
[Guest]: But what we did not realize was that the society

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
[Guest]: was in a stressed state because of demonetization.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
[Guest]: And, you know, it was a sort of a sudden decision

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
[Guest]: which people did not anticipate.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
[Guest]: So then at that point of time,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
[Guest]: they were ready to believe anything that is put out.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
[Guest]: So there were so many rumors about demonetization,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
[Guest]: for example, that GPS chip, right?

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
[Guest]: And people took in these rumors.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
[Guest]: Everybody took in these rumors.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
[Guest]: Some of the rumors even I might have believed,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
[Guest]: you know, because we were in such a state.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
[Guest]: So it's very important to understand

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
[Guest]: that the more stress the society gets,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
[Guest]: you know, the more the rumors,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
[Guest]: the more will people intake these kinds of rumors.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
[Guest]: So those are the observations that we had

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
[Guest]: and which is why we created that document in September 2016,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
[Guest]: saying that, you know, we really need to sort of start

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
[Guest]: debunking misinformation, create a portal for it.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
[Guest]: And me and Zubair, Mohammed Zubair,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
[Guest]: both of us co-founded Alt News.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
[Guest]: Zubair used to run a Facebook page,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
[Guest]: a parody Facebook page called Unofficial Subramaniam Swamy.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
[Guest]: I used to run Truth of Gujarat.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
[Guest]: And we already had a collective following about 800,000,

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
[Guest]: between 800,000 and a million,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
[Guest]: including Twitter and Facebook.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
[Guest]: So we were in a unique position that we already have an audience

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
[Guest]: as opposed to many organizations who start without an audience.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
[Guest]: And we're like, let's start putting things on a portal

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
[Guest]: and let's see what happens.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
[Guest]: You know, one year hence, we'll see whether it works out or not.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
[Guest]: Zubair continued to work,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
[Guest]: but I stopped freelancing at that point in time.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
[Guest]: And let's do this for one year,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
[Guest]: we'll figure out whether this works or not.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
[Guest]: But within three months, Alt News took off quite well.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
[Amit Varma]: And you said that, you know, you told me earlier

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
[Amit Varma]: that the impetus behind Alt News was really fear.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
[Amit Varma]: Just elaborate on that a bit.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
[Guest]: Yeah, so a lot of these videos,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
[Guest]: some of the first few articles that we've written on Alt News

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
[Guest]: are videos from Mexico, Brazil, et cetera,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
[Guest]: being passed around claiming that these are Muslims killing Hindus.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
[Guest]: And every time at that point of time,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
[Guest]: when we used to see these videos,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
[Guest]: there used to be a fear that, you know,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
[Guest]: this is going to lead to the next riot.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
[Guest]: If you remember Muzaffarnagar riots, that is what happened, right?

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
[Guest]: There was a video from Pakistan, which was put out,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
[Guest]: and that led to riots.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
[Guest]: And there have been other instances.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
[Guest]: In Pune, there was a Muslim boy, a techie, was killed

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
[Guest]: because there was a morphed image which was circulated of a Hindu idol.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
[Guest]: And there were riots, and this guy had nothing to do with any of this.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
[Guest]: He was just going back to his home or to work, and he got killed.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
[Guest]: So we were seeing that,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
[Guest]: these manifestations of misinformation in the society.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
[Guest]: And so that was the fear that, you know,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
[Guest]: this video could lead to a riot.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
[Guest]: And, you know, you'd write really, you know, sort of put out,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
[Guest]: try to put it out as far as possible.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
[Guest]: The language, even back then,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
[Guest]: we have changed some of those articles now,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
[Guest]: but even our language back then,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
[Guest]: when I read back the way I had written some of those articles,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
[Guest]: you could see the fear that, please don't share these,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
[Guest]: you know, this is completely false.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
[Guest]: We don't write that way anymore.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
[Guest]: We have a more professional way of writing things.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
[Guest]: But even in the language back then,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
[Guest]: I could see that there was a fear inside,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
[Guest]: which is why we sort of were doing this very, very,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
[Guest]: there was a bit of desperation in the language.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
[Amit Varma]: And before we go deeper into the subject of fake news,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
[Amit Varma]: I'd also like you to define it for me,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
[Amit Varma]: because you've written eloquently about how

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
[Amit Varma]: there are different kinds of fake news as a distinction

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
[Amit Varma]: between misinformation and disinformation and so on.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
[Guest]: Tell me a little bit about that.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
[Guest]: So actually, we hardly ever use the phrase fake news anymore.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
[Guest]: We have gone away from using that.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
[Guest]: I don't think I have used it even once.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
[Amit Varma]: You haven't, I have, in fact.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
[Guest]: Yes, we don't use that phrase anymore.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
[Guest]: We use misinformation and disinformation or malinformation.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
[Guest]: So misinformation is essentially,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
[Guest]: first, okay, disinformation is when you know something is false

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
[Guest]: and you still propagate it.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
[Guest]: Misinformation is you're propagating it without,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
[Guest]: it is false, but you don't know whether you're,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
[Guest]: it is false or not, and you're not bothered to check

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
[Guest]: and you're still propagating it.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
[Guest]: Those are the broad definitions.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
[Guest]: So we usually stick to these two terms.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
[Guest]: We don't use the, unless it is very, very specifically fake news,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
[Guest]: that is a mainstream media is putting it out

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
[Guest]: and it is fake in nature.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
[Guest]: Usually only then, or it has been framed in form of news

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
[Guest]: and it is completely fake.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
[Guest]: You know, very, very few times we use the phrase fake news.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
[Amit Varma]: So just to sort of try and illustrate that

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
[Amit Varma]: and tell me if my illustrations are correct.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
[Amit Varma]: So this information would be that if I am a hardcore Hindutva person

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and I sent out this message saying that,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
[Amit Varma]: look, the Muslim birth rate is nine, which someone once told me,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
[Amit Varma]: by the way, the Muslim birth replacement rate is nine

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
[Amit Varma]: and soon they will be the majority in India.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
[Amit Varma]: And I know it's false, but I send it out.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
[Amit Varma]: That is disinformation and misinformation would be

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
[Amit Varma]: if I receive a WhatsApp forward saying shops are running out of sugar

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
[Amit Varma]: and I have no way of knowing whatever,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
[Amit Varma]: but it seems like something I should let people know about

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
[Amit Varma]: so they can get sugar, though sugar is poison.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
[Amit Varma]: And then I forward that out.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
[Amit Varma]: So that is misinformation.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you just said something which is really interesting

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
[Amit Varma]: and I also want to now ask you about that,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
[Amit Varma]: which is the two ways in which misinformation or disinformation originates.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Like people have this impression about misinformation, disinformation,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
[Amit Varma]: fake news, whatever, for the purpose of convenience,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll just call it fake news for now.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
[Amit Varma]: But people have this impression about it that,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
[Amit Varma]: oh, it's these political IT cell fake news factories

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
[Amit Varma]: which are churning these out and there are workers

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
[Amit Varma]: who have been paid to sit and write these WhatsApp messages

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and they are sort of forwarded out.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
[Amit Varma]: But what you've indicated in this episode

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
[Amit Varma]: and what you once told me in a conversation we had a long time ago

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
[Amit Varma]: with regard to the Rohit Sardana case, for example,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
[Amit Varma]: is that there is a lot of this misinformation happens organically,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
[Amit Varma]: that there is a market for it.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
[Amit Varma]: And because there is a market of willing consumers for fake news,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
[Amit Varma]: people create fake news just to sort of get clicks, make money, all of that.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Is it necessary that there is a political motivation or something like that?

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
[Guest]: I wouldn't say there's a market for consuming fake news or misinformation.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
[Guest]: There's a market for consuming sensationalism.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
[Guest]: A lot of media organizations indulge in that

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
[Guest]: purely because there's a market for it.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.000
[Guest]: So, for example, once there was this tweet,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
[Guest]: this social media trend called I support Rohit Sardana,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
[Guest]: and it was claimed that there are some X number of fatwas

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
[Guest]: which were issued against Rohit Sardana.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
[Guest]: And by evening, Rohit Sardana came out and clarified that

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
[Guest]: there's no such thing that has happened.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
[Guest]: Please, you know, stay away from misinformation

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
[Guest]: and thank you for the support.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
[Guest]: So I went and dug into this and tried to figure out where this originated from.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
[Guest]: And it took me to a website, completely unknown website,

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000
[Guest]: which had first put this and then multiple of these right-wing websites

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
[Guest]: that carried in.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
[Guest]: Just to sort of think of that this is not limited to right-wing.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
[Guest]: It is across ideological spectrums.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
[Guest]: Just want to put it out.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
[Guest]: But it definitely started more in the right-wing.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
[Guest]: Anyway, so going back to the conversation.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
[Guest]: So I tracked this website and we wrote a story.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
[Guest]: I found the Facebook profile of this person.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
[Guest]: He looked like a very young kid.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
[Guest]: And on his Facebook profile, there were two screenshots

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
[Guest]: of him getting advertising money from a couple of advertising companies.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
[Guest]: You know, some 18,000 rupees in all, I think.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
[Guest]: We wrote the story.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
[Guest]: And I forgot about it.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
[Guest]: Next day, I get a message from an anonymous WhatsApp number

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
[Guest]: saying that he said this in Hindi.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
[Guest]: So then I got his phone number and I spoke with him

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000
[Guest]: and it turned out that he was a class 12 boy who was studying in Ranchi.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
[Guest]: His father was a farm help in a village outside Ranchi,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
[Guest]: earning 6,000 rupees a month.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
[Guest]: And he said that to pay my expense, this is what I do.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
[Guest]: And interestingly, I spoke with somebody similar just a few days ago.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
[Guest]: But this was in 2017.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
[Guest]: And he said that you got one detail wrong.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
[Guest]: I don't make 20,000 rupees a month.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
[Guest]: I make 40,000 rupees a month.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
[Guest]: But then I tried to tell him that, you know,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
[Guest]: look, you're going to get into trouble at some point in time.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
[Guest]: And eventually, I think he shut down the website.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
[Guest]: I don't know what he's doing at this point in time.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
[Guest]: And this kid said something very interesting.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
[Guest]: He said that only if I put this misinformation,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
[Guest]: look, so many websites are covered.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
[Guest]: He said it as a matter of pride that there's this other website

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
[Guest]: called hindutva.info, which was sort of a very popular website

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
[Guest]: at that point in time.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
[Guest]: And he said, look, hindutva.info has also written about it.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
[Guest]: And he knew that it was completely false.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
[Guest]: He's like, people only read when you write these things.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
[Guest]: So there's a market for sensationalism.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
[Guest]: I wouldn't say there's a market for, you know, misinformation per se.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
[Guest]: There's a lot of misinformation in sensationalism.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
[Amit Varma]: That's a very nuanced point because I had, in fact, assumed

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
[Amit Varma]: when I first heard the story from you that, okay, this is, you know,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
[Amit Varma]: there's an organic demand for the, you know, fake news, so to say.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
[Amit Varma]: But as you're pointing out, there's an organic demand for sensationalism,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
[Amit Varma]: which has always been there.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
[Amit Varma]: And the sensational will often be fake.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
[Amit Varma]: And often people who are creating this news don't even care

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
[Amit Varma]: whether it's fake or real, and they don't think too hard

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
[Amit Varma]: about the consequences.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
[Amit Varma]: It's just that you want the clicks and all of that.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And, like, over time, as you examine different categories

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
[Amit Varma]: of misinformation and disinformation,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
[Amit Varma]: is it always clear that what is the intent,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
[Amit Varma]: and therefore you figure out where it originated from?

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
[Amit Varma]: Or sometimes is it the case that the intent is only sensationalism

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
[Amit Varma]: and there's no other intent?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, you know, earlier you mentioned that shops are running

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
[Amit Varma]: out of sugar, and there was that rumor during Demond.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, where would that have originated from and why?

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Or is it just something that someone…

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
[Guest]: Very often you can't figure out intent, and it is not always organic.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
[Guest]: So this was organic in the sense somebody created.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
[Guest]: But I do believe that there are individuals who are tasked to do this.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
[Guest]: There's an organized way of putting out misinformation.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
[Guest]: And, you know, since the time Altnew started, since the time

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
[Guest]: we wrote about certain websites, for example, the Postcard News guy,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
[Guest]: there's a guy called Mahesh Vikram Hegde who got arrested

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
[Guest]: based on an Altnew story.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
[Guest]: And even my thoughts about, you know, whether people should be

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
[Guest]: arrested or not have changed.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
[Guest]: At that point of time, we wrote an article saying that it

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
[Guest]: is an achievement, and I think back, and I think that it was

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
[Guest]: a wrong thing to do.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000
[Guest]: I don't think he should have been arrested, but we can go to that later.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
[Guest]: So what happened was that the fear that you could get arrested,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
[Guest]: in the U.S. you are protected by First Amendment,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
[Guest]: so which is why there are multiple fake news websites

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
[Guest]: which continue there because you're not going to get arrested

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
[Guest]: for writing something.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
[Guest]: But here, since there's a fear that you might get arrested,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
[Guest]: so that business which had started in 2015-2016 of writing

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
[Guest]: communal misinformation has more or less stopped.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
[Guest]: You don't hear of Postcard News, etc.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
[Guest]: There used to be this website called Dhyanik Bharat

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
[Guest]: that has also gone down.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
[Guest]: So that phenomenon has stopped.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
[Guest]: So misinformation in order to make money has stopped.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
[Guest]: There's other kinds of misinformation like Bollywood, gossip,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000
[Guest]: you know, that kind.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
[Guest]: But communal misinformation, knowing that it could sort of

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
[Guest]: land you in jail, I think that has come down a lot on websites

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
[Guest]: in order to make money.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
[Guest]: But what has now increased is organized misinformation.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
[Guest]: You look at Balakot strikes.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
[Guest]: When Balakot strikes happened, that was one of the busiest

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
[Guest]: times for us.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
[Guest]: I mean, there was such a spike of misinformation.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
[Guest]: So one of them was a video game which went viral claiming that

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
[Guest]: you can see a missile honing onto a building and sort of

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
[Guest]: blasting the building.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
[Guest]: And it was claimed that these are Balakot strikes.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
[Guest]: Now the person who put out that in the first place,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
[Guest]: somebody does not just come across a video and say that,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000
[Guest]: okay, this is Balakot strikes.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
[Guest]: That person knows that let me take this video and put the spin to it.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
[Guest]: The first person who has done this.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
[Guest]: So that is organized misinformation.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
[Guest]: And the fact that when Balakot happened,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
[Guest]: so there was another one which was a group of 10 images which

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
[Guest]: claimed that this is the level of devastation in Pakistan.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
[Guest]: And it has reached literally every phone.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
[Guest]: I don't know if you've seen those group of 10 images,

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
[Guest]: but it has almost reached every phone saying that this is the level

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
[Guest]: of devastation, the picture of dead bodies.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
[Guest]: What we found was I think four of them was from a heat stroke in Pakistan.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
[Guest]: Four of some others were from an earthquake,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
[Guest]: but not a single picture was a recent one.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
[Guest]: Now somebody did not come across these pictures and said that,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
[Guest]: oh, these are pictures from Balakot.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000
[Guest]: Somebody put that out with that narrative.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
[Guest]: So there are people who are thinking of these narratives and putting

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
[Guest]: out misinformation that is not organic.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
[Guest]: Once it is out on social media, it goes around in an organic manner.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
[Guest]: But people, there are people who are sitting there and creating

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
[Guest]: misinformation and every pattern that you can see now,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
[Guest]: it suggests that, you know, for example, during elections,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
[Guest]: a lot of misinformation was targeting political leaders.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
[Guest]: Okay, so I'll give you an example of Rajnath Singh and Rahul Gandhi.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
[Guest]: So Rajnath Singh was at a rally and he said that,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
[Guest]: Chowkidar chaur nahi hai, Chowkidar pure hai. Okay. And he asks the crowd

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
[Guest]: to repeat that and the crowd repeats Chowkidar pure hai.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
[Guest]: They cut the part where Rajnath Singh says this and they only

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
[Guest]: play the part where the crowd says it.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
[Guest]: Now, because you're used to hearing Chowkidar chaur hai,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
[Guest]: you think that the crowd is saying Chowkidar chaur hai.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
[Guest]: But they were actually saying Chowkidar pure hai and MP Congress's

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
[Guest]: official verified Twitter handle put out this video saying that,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
[Guest]: dekho Rajnath Singh ne kya bulwa diya. Okay.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
[Guest]: So now somebody who's cutting it out at that point of time,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
[Guest]: you know, I don't know if the person handling MP Congress

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
[Guest]: handled it or somebody else, most likely somebody else.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
[Guest]: But the person who did it knew exactly what the impact will be.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
[Guest]: Right. In case of Rahul Gandhi, one of the videos which was extremely viral

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000
[Guest]: where Rahul Gandhi apparently says that women in UP bear 52 children

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
[Guest]: in every year they bear 52 children.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
[Guest]: The context of the story was it is a six-year-old video where Rahul Gandhi,

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
[Guest]: this was during UPA time when UPA had started a scheme for pregnant women.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
[Guest]: If you have institutional delivery, they give you 7,000 or 7,200 rupees.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
[Guest]: If you have a home delivery, they give you 3,600 rupees.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
[Guest]: This was, I think, funds coming from the union to state.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000
[Guest]: And according to RTI response, the same woman's name was repeated 52 times.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
[Guest]: So as part of the way politicians speak, he said that

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
[Guest]: UP mein mahila hai 52 bachche deti hai, you know, har saal.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
[Guest]: And only that was cut off, you know, that 52 bachche.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
[Guest]: And that became so viral.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
[Guest]: The funny thing was, so viral to the point that Haryana CM ML Khattar

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
[Guest]: said that in a speech leading to elections.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
[Guest]: There was a BJP candidate from Madhya Pradesh.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
[Guest]: I forget which constituency.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
[Guest]: He went and said the same thing that Rahul Gandhi ne kaha hai ki

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
[Guest]: UP mein 52 bachche dete hai mahila hai.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
[Guest]: What the folks in Congress did was cut his statement.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
[Guest]: So now it would seem that he's saying that UP mein 52 bachche dete hai mahila hai.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
[Guest]: And then that second video became viral.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
[Guest]: This is nuts.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:50.000
[Guest]: So again, but people who are doing this and now on, which is why, you know,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
[Guest]: earlier I made that it is on both sides of the ideological spectrum.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000
[Guest]: They know that there is this fault line in our democracy where there is

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
[Guest]: a huge lack of digital literacy.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
[Guest]: They know that people are not in a position to figure out whether

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
[Guest]: somebody said this or not.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
[Guest]: When you cut a clip like that, very convincingly, people will,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
[Guest]: there's a huge section of population which will fall for it.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
[Guest]: And they have at this point of time, again, I keep going back to saying

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
[Guest]: that we have not given people tools to figure out what is true, what is not.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
[Guest]: We have given them a lot of tools to consume information.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
[Guest]: We have not given them a single tool.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
[Guest]: There's not a single tool on the phone which will tell you that,

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
[Guest]: look, this is not true.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
[Guest]: This is false.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
[Amit Varma]: And as we progress in the episode, I will ask you about the Alt News app,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
[Amit Varma]: which I downloaded yesterday.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And I would encourage all my listeners to download the app and try it out.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
[Amit Varma]: But before we do that, let's talk about organized misinformation

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
[Amit Varma]: a little bit more now.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, at some point, perhaps around 2016, perhaps afterwards,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
[Amit Varma]: these guys realize at a political level that organized misinformation

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
[Amit Varma]: is the way to go.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000
[Amit Varma]: People are gullible for sensationalism, so you make anything sensational,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
[Amit Varma]: they'll believe it and blah, blah, blah.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
[Amit Varma]: And you have these factories set up.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
[Amit Varma]: And I assume that the ruling party's factory would have been there first

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
[Amit Varma]: and would have been sort of much better.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
[Amit Varma]: And now everyone does it.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
[Amit Varma]: Perhaps it's like a hygiene factor.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
[Amit Varma]: All parties have to do it.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, you can't survive in the information battle.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000
[Amit Varma]: But, like, from what you know, what is it like?

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, how organized are they?

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
[Amit Varma]: How well manned are they?

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000
[Amit Varma]: What are their processes?

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, do they just watch videos continuously and news continuously

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
[Amit Varma]: and decide, okay, we can give it the spin?

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Do they have strategic imperatives, heuristics by which they pick things?

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
[Guest]: I have no insight into that at all.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
[Guest]: There's no – and that is where I think we have sort of lacked,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
[Guest]: because, you know, a lot of us don't come from a journalistic background.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
[Guest]: All of that needs actually getting into these places

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
[Guest]: and figuring out how things work.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
[Guest]: That is something that we have not worked at.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
[Guest]: But, you know, a six-year-old video, and the speech was an hour-long speech.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
[Guest]: For somebody to find that five-second clip in an hour-long video

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
[Guest]: and put that out, that means somebody is sitting and, you know,

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
[Guest]: looking at all these things, seeing how something can be taken out.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
[Guest]: So, somebody is spending a lot of time, and somebody has been tasked to do it.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
[Guest]: But how exactly this is happening, how people are being paid,

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
[Guest]: where are they sitting, who's doing this, we have no insight into whatsoever.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
[Amit Varma]: And, in fact, two thoughts strike me here.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
[Amit Varma]: And one is that it's really, I have to say here, a failure of journalism.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
[Amit Varma]: This is something that our mass media should really –

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is basic investigative journalism.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
[Amit Varma]: It's probably the most important story of our times

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
[Amit Varma]: in terms of the threats that our democracy faces.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's astonishing that some embedded reporter somewhere

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
[Amit Varma]: hasn't done a journalistic story on this.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
[Amit Varma]: I think Swati Chaturvedi, of course, wrote a book about the trolls of the BJP.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
[Amit Varma]: But that's, like, kind of different.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
[Amit Varma]: And I recorded an episode last week with Akshay Mukul,

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
[Amit Varma]: who's written the book on the Gita Press, which –

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I don't know which of these episodes will get released first.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000
[Amit Varma]: But – and what struck me during that episode with him is

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
[Amit Varma]: that this whole mission of spreading misinformation

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
[Amit Varma]: with strategic and tactical intent is not something

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
[Amit Varma]: that has happened because of technology.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Perhaps it's been amplified by technology today,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
[Amit Varma]: enabled at a much larger scale.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
[Amit Varma]: But right from the early days of the Gita Press

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
[Amit Varma]: and their monthly journal Kalyan, which was set up in 1926,

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
[Amit Varma]: it has been a regular thing.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
[Amit Varma]: The editor of Kalyan, Hanuman Prasad Poddar,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
[Amit Varma]: used to write editorials which had fake news,

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
[Amit Varma]: whether it's about Hindu women being abducted and raped or whatever.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
[Amit Varma]: And this information, as you put it, not misinformation,

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
[Amit Varma]: with a specific malafide intent,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and it would seem technology has just taken it to a whole new level.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
[Amit Varma]: And is it the case, as people often say,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
[Amit Varma]: that it's far easier to spread misinformation

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
[Amit Varma]: than to actually then spread the fact-checking of it?

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
[Amit Varma]: Fake news travels faster than fact-checking.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Is that true? What are your thoughts?

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
[Guest]: I'm not ready to buy that story.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
[Guest]: Yes, there has been research done in this.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
[Guest]: Science, a very popular science magazine, Science,

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
[Guest]: put out that tweets which have misinformation,

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
[Guest]: they sort of go much further.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
[Guest]: But again, I keep coming back to the thing

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
[Guest]: that where is the... you not enable people.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000
[Guest]: You know, we have seen...

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
[Guest]: So, for example, the case of vaccination.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
[Guest]: There was a time when there were people

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
[Guest]: who were dying of certain common ailments

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
[Guest]: which now are gone because of vaccination.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
[Guest]: And the society and the governments across the world,

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
[Guest]: they took it upon themselves to spread the word.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000
[Guest]: Now, even somebody who doesn't have any idea about vaccination,

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000
[Guest]: that person goes and gets their child vaccinated.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
[Guest]: They have no clue, but they've just been told

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000
[Guest]: that you have to vaccinate your child, right?

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
[Guest]: So, I do believe that once you enable people enough,

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
[Guest]: there is a way to sort of push back on misinformation.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
[Guest]: Yes, there are biases.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
[Guest]: It may not be a one-on-one example

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
[Guest]: of what I'm saying with vaccination,

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
[Guest]: but there are certain...

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
[Guest]: And people have certain biases,

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
[Guest]: so they're more likely to believe

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
[Guest]: one misinformation over another.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
[Guest]: We have all those challenges,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
[Guest]: but over the past two and a half years,

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
[Guest]: we have seen that people are willing to go

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
[Guest]: beyond what their inherent biases are.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
[Guest]: We have had about 10 million views,

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
[Guest]: or more than 10 million views.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000
[Guest]: During the election time, only we had about 4 million views

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
[Guest]: over the past four months.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
[Guest]: And I think there are at least a good 50,000 to 100,000 people

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000
[Guest]: who read Alt News on a regular basis,

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
[Guest]: who may not be consuming every story,

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
[Guest]: but consume multiple stories.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
[Guest]: And I think that I have seen these people.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000
[Guest]: I know that if you look at their Twitter timeline, et cetera,

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000
[Guest]: you know that they support a particular dispensation,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000
[Guest]: or they are against a certain dispensation, either of them.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
[Guest]: But I have seen many of them, people,

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
[Guest]: go against their inherent biases

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000
[Guest]: and tag Alt News on Twitter or other places.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
[Guest]: Pratik, can you check, is this true?

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
[Guest]: Alt News, can you check, is this true?

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
[Guest]: So, I think there is a way

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
[Guest]: of creating critical thought in the society

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
[Guest]: when some person is told again and again

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
[Guest]: that, look, what you got yesterday,

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
[Guest]: what you got the day before yesterday, et cetera, is false.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
[Guest]: And when you do that again and again,

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
[Guest]: there is a point in time when that person will be,

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000
[Guest]: okay, let me first check whether this is true or false or not.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000
[Guest]: And I believe that that is the model

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000
[Guest]: that we are hoping can be replicated on a larger scale.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000
[Guest]: And once that is done, you know, at this point of time,

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
[Guest]: in case of India, most of the misinformation on WhatsApp,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
[Guest]: and I keep coming back to the point,

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000
[Guest]: you can keep talking about,

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000
[Guest]: yes, people are putting out misinformation,

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000
[Guest]: but what has anybody done for them to be able to counter that?

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000
[Guest]: So, when you don't have that,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
[Guest]: let's say when you don't have a vaccination of misinformation,

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
[Guest]: then what is the point of research

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
[Guest]: which says that misinformation travels faster?

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
[Guest]: That is where I am.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
[Guest]: Yes, maybe three years hence when we have more tools

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
[Guest]: and when that research is done,

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000
[Guest]: I would take that research more seriously than what I do now.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000
[Amit Varma]: This episode is proceeding along far more optimistic lines

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
[Amit Varma]: than I had assumed.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000
[Amit Varma]: We'll take a quick commercial break

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
[Amit Varma]: and we'll return to the conversation.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Pratik Sinha,

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
[Amit Varma]: founder of AltNews, about

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
[Amit Varma]: misinformation, disinformation,

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
[Amit Varma]: malinformation, and the resistant

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
[Amit Varma]: movement against falsehood.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Though that's my phrasing, not his.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Pratik, you were telling me earlier

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
[Amit Varma]: before this that there was

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
[Amit Varma]: a specific reasoning to

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
[Amit Varma]: your setting up AltNews as

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
[Amit Varma]: a not-for-profit as opposed to a for-profit.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, I was making the argument

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000
[Amit Varma]: coming from where I come from that, look, I think you're

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
[Amit Varma]: creating something of enormous value.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
[Amit Varma]: And what I would really love to see is you

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
[Amit Varma]: guys flourish as a for-profit company

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
[Amit Varma]: where consumers will recognize that value

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
[Amit Varma]: and there's a means of your getting rewarded

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
[Amit Varma]: for that. But you told

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
[Amit Varma]: me that, no, you set up as a not-for-profit

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
[Amit Varma]: for a specific reason.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
[Guest]: Can you go through that?

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000
[Guest]: Right. So, AltNews,

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000
[Guest]: there are two things that

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000
[Guest]: we are trying to experiment. One is

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
[Guest]: how to promote critical thought in the society

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000
[Guest]: and debunking misinformation

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
[Guest]: is a means to that.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
[Guest]: The other thing that we are experimenting

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
[Guest]: is how to set up a media

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000
[Guest]: organization in a democracy

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
[Guest]: where the institutions are being

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000
[Guest]: compromised, right? So,

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
[Guest]: let's say if you take the example of

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
[Guest]: US and right now

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
[Guest]: there's New York Times, Washington

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000
[Guest]: Post, CNN. They are going hammer and tongs

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
[Guest]: against Trump, but you don't see

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
[Guest]: them being raided every other

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
[Guest]: day. There's still space

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
[Guest]: for people to talk against the government.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
[Guest]: In India, the media has gone

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
[Guest]: exactly the opposite way where

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
[Guest]: there's very little criticism of

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
[Guest]: the government that is coming out.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
[Guest]: And I think a part of the

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
[Guest]: reason is because

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
[Guest]: there's so much money

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
[Guest]: that goes into media and there are these big investors

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
[Guest]: who are putting in money and

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
[Guest]: in India, we keep

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
[Guest]: talking about ease of doing business,

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
[Guest]: but we know as a matter of

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
[Guest]: fact that even if somebody wants to be,

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
[Guest]: wants to do an honest business,

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
[Guest]: that person has to cut so many

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
[Guest]: corners. And

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
[Guest]: eventually, let's say this person thinks

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
[Guest]: that he wants to invest in a cause such as

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
[Guest]: Alt News and puts his

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
[Guest]: or her money and then

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
[Guest]: what happens is the government goes after

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
[Guest]: them and their tax rates,

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
[Guest]: even if there's nothing, they'll

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
[Guest]: try to harass you.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
[Guest]: And that is when either the

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
[Guest]: investor pulls out, which means that you

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
[Guest]: started something, you're dependent on an investor and suddenly

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
[Guest]: you don't have the money. So you have to let go people,

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
[Guest]: the thing dies.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
[Guest]: Or the investor says,

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
[Guest]: can you not write about this? You write about these things.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
[Guest]: And then day after day

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000
[Guest]: that things about

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000
[Guest]: can you not write about this, that category

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000
[Guest]: keeps increasing. And eventually

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
[Guest]: you're completely stifled.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000
[Guest]: So I think that is what

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
[Guest]: has happened with a lot of media organizations

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
[Guest]: today, either of

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000
[Guest]: these two phenomena. So when we

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
[Guest]: started Alt News, the first idea was

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000
[Guest]: how to keep it sustained

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
[Guest]: without getting a big ticket

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
[Guest]: investor into the picture and

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
[Guest]: by educating people

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
[Guest]: that they need to

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
[Guest]: willingly donate to such

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
[Guest]: an organization if they want

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
[Guest]: something which is without a filter.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
[Guest]: Because again, I keep saying that

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
[Guest]: this is across political

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
[Guest]: ideologies and if tomorrow

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
[Guest]: there's a new government in power,

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
[Guest]: let's say if there is a change,

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
[Guest]: they will have the same kind of

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
[Guest]: animosity or

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
[Guest]: they are not going to be huge fans

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
[Guest]: of Alt News just because

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
[Guest]: now they are in power and now they are promoting.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
[Guest]: It's the same thing that happened with Ravish.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
[Guest]: There are many people who, during

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
[Guest]: UPA time, many people who were

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
[Guest]: opposed to UPA were big supporters

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
[Guest]: of Ravish. And now the same

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000
[Guest]: people don't like Ravish. So it happens

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
[Guest]: in this journalism cycle.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
[Guest]: So we wanted something which is

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
[Guest]: completely funded by people, create

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
[Guest]: again, it is part of educating

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000
[Guest]: people that you need to

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
[Guest]: give us money if you want us to keep doing it, depending

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
[Guest]: on your resources. There are kids,

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
[Guest]: there are college kids who will give

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
[Guest]: 10 rupees. The minimum donation for Alt News

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
[Guest]: is 9 rupees. They'll give 10 rupees

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
[Guest]: and they'll say that,

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
[Guest]: if I get a job, I'll give more money

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
[Guest]: but please keep doing what you're doing.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
[Guest]: That is what we want to see

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
[Guest]: in people. People willing to give money

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
[Guest]: because they know that, number one,

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
[Guest]: they become a part of the whole thing.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
[Guest]: They have a sense of ownership. And second,

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000
[Guest]: that they know that

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
[Guest]: it's only through their money can they

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
[Guest]: get honest journalism.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
[Guest]: So, in a democracy where institutions

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000
[Guest]: are compromised,

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
[Guest]: you need to devise newer

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
[Guest]: and newer methods to keep

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000
[Guest]: these organizations running. I'm not saying that

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
[Guest]: this will work for everybody. For example,

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
[Guest]: yesterday I was speaking to another

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
[Guest]: gentleman and he told me

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
[Guest]: that your model will never work for me

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
[Guest]: because Alt News has a certain political

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000
[Guest]: impact. So, people tend to

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000
[Guest]: give more donation but

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
[Guest]: if I'm working on rural journalism,

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
[Guest]: nobody is going to give me money. So, it is not that

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
[Guest]: this model will work for everybody but there

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
[Guest]: are at least a certain group of media organizations

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
[Guest]: for whom this model could work.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
[Amit Varma]: That's a great point you make.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
[Amit Varma]: And Ravish, of course, we're recording this on August 4th.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Ravish just this week got the

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
[Amit Varma]: RCA award and more power to him.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
[Amit Varma]: And what good journalists do like Ravish

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
[Amit Varma]: and what you are also doing,

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
[Amit Varma]: though you're not doing journalism, but what you're also doing

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
[Amit Varma]: is constantly speaking truth to power

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
[Amit Varma]: and that necessarily means that whoever

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
[Amit Varma]: is in power won't like you very much.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000
[Amit Varma]: And for the benefit of my listeners, I just

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of want to elaborate on this because

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
[Amit Varma]: this is not something we recognize. It is

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000
[Amit Varma]: impossible for any business

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
[Amit Varma]: in India today to be compliant

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
[Amit Varma]: with the law. Just as an illustration

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
[Amit Varma]: of that, I had an episode a long time back on

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
[Amit Varma]: regulations where the guest

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000
[Amit Varma]: I was doing that episode with told me

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
[Amit Varma]: that when he was running a restaurant,

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
[Amit Varma]: he found that there were two

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
[Amit Varma]: contradictory regulations he had

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
[Amit Varma]: to comply with. One was

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
[Amit Varma]: the excise regulation, which was controlling

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
[Amit Varma]: the sale of alcohol on the premises

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
[Amit Varma]: even though he had a license for it, but they

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
[Amit Varma]: controlled it. And their

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
[Amit Varma]: regulation was that there can only be one

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
[Amit Varma]: entry to the restaurant

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
[Amit Varma]: so they can monitor how alcohol

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
[Amit Varma]: is being taken in and out. And

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
[Amit Varma]: meanwhile, the fire safety department

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
[Amit Varma]: had regulations that every restaurant

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000
[Amit Varma]: has to have multiple doors. So

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
[Amit Varma]: basically what this meant was for my friend running a

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
[Amit Varma]: restaurant is that he could not comply with

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
[Amit Varma]: both their opposite regulations. So he was always

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
[Amit Varma]: breaking the law and effectively he was

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
[Amit Varma]: bribing both people and he was actually

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
[Amit Varma]: bribing 40 people a month, which is what

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000
[Amit Varma]: most businesses face. And every

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000
[Amit Varma]: single business in some way or the other will be

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
[Amit Varma]: breaking the law. If you really want to go after them,

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
[Amit Varma]: you can, you'll find something or the other.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Now the issue with our big media houses

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, the companies that own

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
[Amit Varma]: them and run them are not only into media,

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
[Amit Varma]: they're in a lot of other businesses.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, for example, the company

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
[Amit Varma]: that runs HD media will have a lot of

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000
[Amit Varma]: other business interests. They'll have chemical factories,

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
[Amit Varma]: they'll have this, they'll have that. And the government

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
[Amit Varma]: will choose to put pressure on one of those

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000
[Amit Varma]: till the message comes across that

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
[Amit Varma]: boss, you better behave, otherwise the

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000
[Amit Varma]: whole edifice could collapse. And

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
[Amit Varma]: you see this and this pressure comes

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
[Amit Varma]: from across governments.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, like recently when Bobby Ghosh

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
[Amit Varma]: of HD started the hate tracker,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
[Amit Varma]: boom, he had to leave, he was asked

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
[Amit Varma]: to leave. But a few years earlier

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
[Amit Varma]: when Chidambaram

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
[Amit Varma]: was upset at Raju Narasetty,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, Raju was out of there soon enough.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
[Amit Varma]: In both cases, political

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
[Amit Varma]: pressure applied. We don't know the exact

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
[Amit Varma]: method in which it was applied. Both men

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
[Amit Varma]: made graceful exits. But this

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
[Amit Varma]: is essentially what happened. So any established

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
[Amit Varma]: media house, therefore, you can

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
[Amit Varma]: put so much pressure on them that independent

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
[Amit Varma]: journalism becomes hard, which is a separate

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
[Amit Varma]: subject and a separate rant

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
[Amit Varma]: I often go on to and there are people

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
[Amit Varma]: like Scroll and Wire and Alt News

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
[Amit Varma]: which are fighting the good fight.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, rant over.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
[Guest]: I just wanted to elaborate.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
[Guest]: And I want to make an additional point. This is not just

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
[Guest]: limited to media organisations.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
[Guest]: It extends to every organisation.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
[Guest]: So, for example, I have this

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
[Guest]: inherent trust deficit when it

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
[Guest]: comes to organisations like Facebook,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
[Guest]: Google and Twitter, in terms of a variety

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
[Guest]: of things. So, for example, there's a huge

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
[Guest]: issue of privacy going on, right?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
[Guest]: So tomorrow, let's say a

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
[Guest]: government comes after any of these organisations.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
[Guest]: Again, when they're

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
[Guest]: operating in India, they're operating according to the

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
[Guest]: law of the Indian. They're not operating

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
[Guest]: according to US laws. They're operating according to Indian laws.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
[Guest]: And when somebody goes after them

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
[Guest]: and says that give me this data,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
[Guest]: their choice is to

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
[Guest]: let a billion dollar company

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
[Guest]: go or give the data of

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
[Guest]: a few individuals that the government wants.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
[Guest]: And I think they'll always take this

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
[Guest]: other route.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
[Guest]: And that also has to

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
[Guest]: do with multiple decisions that they

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
[Guest]: make, that they always want to keep the

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
[Guest]: government happy. So, it is not just

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
[Guest]: limited to media organisations.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
[Guest]: This applies to many other organisations

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
[Guest]: who are impacting us in their

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
[Guest]: day-to-day life. Social media

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
[Guest]: and these chat apps are the

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
[Guest]: medium for misinformation. And

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
[Guest]: their inability

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
[Guest]: to have done anything about

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
[Guest]: or doing enough about this,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
[Guest]: I think

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
[Guest]: it is also because they don't want to

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
[Amit Varma]: go on the wrong side of the government.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
[Amit Varma]: That's a great point. And a lot of fake news,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
[Amit Varma]: as you mentioned, happens on WhatsApp,

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
[Amit Varma]: but it also happens on other media. But WhatsApp is

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
[Amit Varma]: one of the major, this thing is owned by

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Facebook and so on. And

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
[Amit Varma]: we've seen them do little things like, for example,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
[Amit Varma]: when a message is forwarded, that stamp comes

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
[Amit Varma]: on it, forwarded, so people kind of know.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure it makes some difference.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
[Amit Varma]: But in general,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
[Amit Varma]: a three-part question, what is

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
[Amit Varma]: it that they can do about it, the

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
[Amit Varma]: tech companies, in terms of

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
[Amit Varma]: whether it's Facebook

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
[Amit Varma]: figuring out that, you know, what's making

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
[Amit Varma]: it harder for people to spread

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
[Amit Varma]: fake news on WhatsApp or Google changing

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
[Amit Varma]: its search algos in such a way that fake news

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
[Amit Varma]: sites don't come up in the results and so on?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Number one, what can tech companies do about

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
[Amit Varma]: it? Number two, how

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
[Amit Varma]: effective is pressure from

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
[Amit Varma]: civil society on these

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
[Amit Varma]: tech companies to change

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
[Amit Varma]: their behaviour? And number three,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
[Amit Varma]: in your experience, how seriously

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
[Amit Varma]: are companies actually taking this?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
[Guest]: So, I think

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
[Guest]: that is a very big question.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
[Guest]: I don't think I have answers to everything, but

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
[Guest]: I do understand some of the

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
[Guest]: tech that is going in. I'll give you a

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
[Guest]: quick example. Let's say when an image

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
[Guest]: or video goes viral and which has an element

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
[Guest]: of misinformation, the pattern is

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
[Guest]: that it will be shared from thousands

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
[Guest]: of accounts with almost

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
[Guest]: identical text. This is the pattern

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
[Guest]: that we see. Okay, so

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
[Guest]: for example, there was this video

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
[Guest]: which went viral which said that

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
[Guest]: in Hyderabad,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
[Guest]: a Marwadi woman was killed

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
[Guest]: for not wearing a burqa

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
[Guest]: in a heart-wrenching video.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
[Guest]: Share it so much that it

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
[Guest]: reaches Modi ji and Modi ji takes instant action.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
[Guest]: This was a

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
[Guest]: four and a half minute video, one of the

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
[Guest]: first videos that we debunked, which was

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
[Guest]: the most grotesque video you'll see.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
[Guest]: A young woman

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
[Guest]: was beaten up and burnt

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
[Guest]: and the video recording stops only

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
[Guest]: when she dies of those burns.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
[Guest]: Now, this is being claimed that

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
[Guest]: it started with that this is a Marwadi woman

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
[Guest]: burnt because of not wearing a burqa.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
[Guest]: She married in a Muslim family,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
[Guest]: did not wear a burqa. The video is actually from

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
[Guest]: Gautamala. The

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
[Guest]: case was that there was

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
[Guest]: three people, including this girl, they

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
[Guest]: allegedly shot a taxi driver. The mob came

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
[Guest]: after them. The two guys could

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
[Guest]: run away. She got caught in a mob and

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
[Guest]: she was killed. Now,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
[Guest]: whenever you see these videos, and we

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
[Guest]: would put the screenshots when

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
[Guest]: we write and alt-use articles to show the extent

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
[Guest]: of spread, you'll

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
[Guest]: see that the same text that I

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
[Guest]: said, word to word, will be copy

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
[Guest]: pasted across many, many, many

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
[Guest]: accounts and the same video.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
[Guest]: So there is a pattern. Whenever there's a

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
[Guest]: pattern, technology is very good at recognizing

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
[Guest]: patterns. What Facebook

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
[Guest]: has done now, for example, is

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
[Guest]: that they have

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
[Guest]: teamed up with various fact-checkers like

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
[Guest]: BoomLive, etc. BoomLive is doing very good

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
[Guest]: work. And so, these fact-checkers are supposed

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
[Guest]: to go and point at instances

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
[Guest]: of misinformation. That, you know,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
[Guest]: this is a video and this is the actual

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
[Guest]: fact. And that is where now you

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
[Guest]: see that thing on Facebook which says that

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
[Guest]: this has been fact-checked and you can

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
[Guest]: read this fact-check. You know, so Facebook

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
[Guest]: is trying to say that we are doing something about it.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
[Guest]: But the thing is that fact-checkers

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
[Guest]: are humans. They are not going to be able to mark

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
[Guest]: 10,000 instances of it. They are

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
[Guest]: only going to be able to mark 2, 3,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
[Guest]: 4, 5 instances of it.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
[Guest]: The rest of the

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
[Guest]: 9,995, that is where tech comes

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
[Guest]: into picture. That is where

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
[Guest]: if you really want to sort of fight

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
[Guest]: against misinformation

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
[Guest]: and many times

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
[Guest]: on Facebook things are shared privately. I won't even see

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
[Guest]: it in public, you know, with that private status

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
[Guest]: you're sharing it only amongst friends.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
[Guest]: If you really want to sort of go

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
[Guest]: after misinformation, then mark everything

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
[Guest]: as false using tech.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
[Guest]: That is one example that you can do.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
[Guest]: And especially political

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
[Guest]: misinformation always follows a pattern

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
[Guest]: because it is different from medical

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
[Guest]: misinformation. Here you are generating complete

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
[Guest]: fiction. You're taking a video from Gautam

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
[Guest]: Ala and you're saying this.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
[Guest]: That story is never going to change

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
[Guest]: throughout the duration of

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
[Guest]: that particular misinformation.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
[Guest]: It is very easy to take down

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
[Guest]: every instance using tech.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
[Guest]: So that is my grouse that

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
[Guest]: they have not done it. For example, Snopes.com

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
[Guest]: had a partnership

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
[Guest]: with Facebook for the same thing and

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
[Guest]: they withdrew from the partnership.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
[Guest]: I think two companies have withdrawn, two big companies

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
[Guest]: from Facebook because they said that

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
[Guest]: it is a completely manual process. Give us an API.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
[Guest]: We don't see that we are making

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
[Guest]: impact.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
[Guest]: This is a common grouse that

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
[Guest]: people have with these platforms.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
[Guest]: My question is why have they not done this?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
[Guest]: Again, when we talk about the

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
[Guest]: all-tunes app, we can speak about it.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
[Guest]: That is exactly what we're doing. You feed us a video,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
[Guest]: you feed us an image and we'll tell you

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
[Guest]: this is the story corresponding to it.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
[Guest]: So that is number one.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
[Guest]: Tech can do a lot of things, even in terms

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
[Guest]: of rankings, etc. My

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
[Guest]: experience in tech is limited to Wi-Fi

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
[Guest]: and embedded systems, so it's like an orthopedic

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
[Guest]: talking about neuroscience.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
[Guest]: I'll talk about what I understand, but I

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
[Guest]: do know, I do understand that

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
[Guest]: there are solutions. The second

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
[Amit Varma]: question was? The second question was

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
[Amit Varma]: what are the ways in which people

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
[Amit Varma]: in civil society can put pressure on

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
[Amit Varma]: tech companies and do they take it seriously?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
[Guest]: They do take it seriously and which is

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
[Guest]: why they do things like WhatsApp saying that

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
[Guest]: we'll limit the forward limit to five.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
[Guest]: We're going to put the forwarder tag. I think

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
[Guest]: the latest thing that they are going to roll out is

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
[Guest]: frequently forwarded. It is not

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
[Guest]: just forwarded and it is frequently forwarded.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
[Guest]: They have not released any statistics

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
[Guest]: internally as to whether

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
[Guest]: it is a successful

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
[Guest]: strategy or not, and I don't

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
[Guest]: have any data to speak of, but observationally

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
[Guest]: over elections, this forwarder thing

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
[Guest]: came before elections. Observationally

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
[Guest]: over elections, I don't see it having

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
[Guest]: any impact.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
[Guest]: Again, we have to continuously

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
[Guest]: acknowledge that misinformation

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
[Guest]: during these elections was an organized

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
[Guest]: attempt. So instead of one

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
[Guest]: person putting it out to

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
[Guest]: 100 groups in one time, you'll have to put

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
[Guest]: it out to five groups at one point in time.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
[Guest]: There was a story by Huffington

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
[Guest]: Post about how a simple tool

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
[Guest]: made to hack WhatsApp

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
[Guest]: web, not hack as in sort of use

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
[Guest]: that to put out bulk misinformation

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
[Guest]: was used. So there are means and ways

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
[Guest]: of getting around these. These are not

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
[Guest]: the solutions and

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
[Guest]: I keep calling

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
[Guest]: this as their way of fighting.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
[Guest]: It's a PR battle that they are fighting.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
[Guest]: They are not trying to solve

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
[Guest]: an issue. So when there

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
[Guest]: is pressure either from the government

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
[Guest]: or from civil society, they do

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
[Guest]: these little things to show that

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
[Guest]: they are working on things, but these

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
[Amit Varma]: are not concrete solutions. And that

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
[Amit Varma]: already kind of answers my third question

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
[Amit Varma]: which is what tech companies are doing about it

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
[Amit Varma]: and would it be fair to then sum that up

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
[Amit Varma]: and say that what they are essentially

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
[Amit Varma]: doing is reactive. They are reacting

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
[Amit Varma]: either to government pressure or to

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
[Amit Varma]: civil society pressure in sort of

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
[Amit Varma]: jugar ways that okay, there's a PR

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
[Amit Varma]: shitstorm happening, let's control it by doing this

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
[Amit Varma]: but not really thinking deeper

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
[Amit Varma]: about what the problem is and let's proactively

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
[Amit Varma]: figure out ways to fix it and see what would be coming.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
[Guest]: It is reactive and

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
[Guest]: so for example, what happened in Myanmar

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
[Guest]: let's say, you know, it is

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
[Guest]: my understanding of social media

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
[Guest]: and world in general is that if something

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
[Guest]: happens one place, it is going

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
[Guest]: to repeat in patterns in other places.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
[Guest]: So what happened in Myanmar was this

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
[Guest]: Rohingya thing and Facebook

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
[Guest]: you know, a lot of misinformation on Facebook

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
[Guest]: then it happened in Sri Lanka, it happened in Philippines

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
[Guest]: so there's a pattern.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
[Guest]: Again, we should not forget

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
[Guest]: that media tech companies are not the

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
[Guest]: only stakeholders. I'm not saying that

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
[Guest]: all the blame lies with tech companies

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
[Guest]: there's a huge amount of blame which lies with

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
[Guest]: government, especially the child kidnapping

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
[Guest]: rumors, I would put the blame much more on

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
[Guest]: government than the tech companies

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
[Guest]: and we should talk about it.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
[Guest]: But despite that, you know

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
[Guest]: I don't think they have

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
[Guest]: done enough, even though they know that for example

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
[Guest]: child kidnapping rumors are viral again

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
[Guest]: we just wrote last week

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
[Guest]: six, I think five to six articles about how

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
[Guest]: these child kidnapping rumors are viral

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
[Guest]: and we actually sent it to the rep in Whatsapp

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
[Guest]: we put it out, we said that

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
[Guest]: and we did not blame Whatsapp in the tweet

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
[Guest]: we put out, we said that it is the police

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
[Guest]: and government which has to take note of it

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
[Guest]: because in this, there's a very limited thing

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
[Guest]: that Whatsapp can do. Last year

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
[Guest]: when the child kidnapping rumors happened

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
[Guest]: what eventually helped is not this

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
[Guest]: changing or forwarding limit, none of that

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
[Guest]: because the child

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
[Guest]: kidnapping rumor was there over

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
[Guest]: and it is a very very interesting phenomenon

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
[Guest]: maybe we should talk about it. Let's talk about it now

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
[Guest]: yeah, so

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
[Guest]: it was there over a certain period of time

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
[Guest]: and it created a fear

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
[Guest]: so for example, people in

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
[Guest]: rural Telangana, Telangana gets as

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
[Guest]: hot as Ahmedabad or Delhi etc

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
[Guest]: and there's a lot of poverty there and people

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
[Guest]: would come out of their houses in summers to

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
[Guest]: sleep. This

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
[Guest]: last summer, they would sleep inside

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
[Guest]: the house and they

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
[Guest]: created this self vigilante groups to look for

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
[Guest]: these child kidnappers. What did this

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
[Guest]: rumor say? The rumor said that

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
[Guest]: it was a

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
[Guest]: blurb of text with

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
[Guest]: multiple images and one or two videos

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
[Guest]: usually. The text said that

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
[Guest]: there are x number of people, 500-600 people

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
[Guest]: coming from outside, they are going to

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
[Guest]: kidnap your children, traffic their organs

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
[Guest]: and this message has been

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
[Guest]: sent out by the following

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
[Guest]: police commissioner. Okay, and then

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
[Guest]: there are videos of dead people, bloodied people

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
[Guest]: there is one video which is actually from

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
[Guest]: Pakistan where

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
[Guest]: in the original video, there are

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
[Guest]: two people on bike who come and there

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
[Guest]: are these little kids who are playing cricket on the street

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
[Guest]: they pick up a kid and go away and then

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
[Guest]: they come back and show a placard

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
[Guest]: saying that this is how easy it is to

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
[Guest]: kidnap children in Karachi.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
[Guest]: That part where they show the placard was cut off

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
[Guest]: and only the part where

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
[Guest]: they show the bikers come

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
[Guest]: and that clip video was

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
[Guest]: circulated along with this, essentially trying to

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
[Guest]: say that these are the people on prowl

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
[Guest]: in your area. Now

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
[Guest]: few aspects of this, what eventually

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
[Guest]: stopped it and which is where the government responsibility

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
[Guest]: comes is that when 30 people died

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
[Guest]: eventually Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad made a statement

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
[Guest]: I know that this is a state law, law

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
[Guest]: as a matter of a state, but when it is

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
[Guest]: happening all over the country, that is when the union government

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
[Guest]: should have reacted much before

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
[Guest]: and eventually the police

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
[Guest]: and the administration, they fanned out to

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
[Guest]: into different areas physically and

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
[Guest]: telling people that look this is not

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
[Guest]: true, this is false, this is not true, this is false

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
[Guest]: this is not true and that is what eventually

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
[Guest]: stopped the killing. So it is nothing

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
[Guest]: that Facebook or WhatsApp could do to stop

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
[Guest]: the killing, it was a quick

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
[Guest]: educational initiative, a small

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
[Guest]: you know on just that little point

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
[Guest]: that look this is, there is fear

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
[Guest]: among people and all you need is somebody

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
[Guest]: you trust, an authority to tell

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
[Guest]: them that this is

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
[Guest]: not true. That is one aspect of it

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
[Guest]: which is where I completely blame the

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
[Guest]: government for what happened and which what

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
[Guest]: continues to happen that they have not

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
[Guest]: taken any initiative as far as

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
[Guest]: digital empowerment is concerned.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
[Guest]: But the very interesting part

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
[Guest]: of these child kidnapping rumours

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
[Guest]: was that it happened in multiple

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
[Guest]: states which meant that all these rumours

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
[Guest]: were being translated.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
[Guest]: And as it moved from

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
[Guest]: town to town, for example

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
[Guest]: if it is in Kutch it will say that

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
[Guest]: the Kutch police commissioner has given

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
[Guest]: this thing. If it is Ahmedabad

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
[Guest]: it will say Ahmedabad police commissioner has given this thing.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
[Guest]: So who is changing that?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
[Guest]: Who is changing, in Dhule five

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
[Guest]: people were killed, it was in Marathi

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
[Guest]: again it was a local police commissioner.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
[Guest]: So what intrigued me and

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
[Guest]: I don't think anybody has been able to answer that question

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
[Guest]: was there was somebody who

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
[Guest]: was changing these things, you know, these tiny

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
[Guest]: bits of information. Otherwise

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
[Guest]: the rumour is same, the translation is

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
[Guest]: same but as it went from

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
[Guest]: place to place, the name of the police

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
[Guest]: commissioner it kept changing.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
[Guest]: And that intrigued me a lot that who is doing

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
[Guest]: this? What is the motive? What is the purpose?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
[Guest]: You could never figure out and it is

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
[Guest]: viral again now. There were 15

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
[Guest]: attacks in Madhya Pradesh when we wrote the article.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
[Guest]: Today I haven't confirmed

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
[Guest]: this but I just read

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
[Guest]: just before coming to this podcast

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
[Guest]: that there have been three attacks in Bihar.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
[Amit Varma]: I have not confirmed this but I just read about this.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
[Amit Varma]: We are recording this on the morning

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
[Amit Varma]: of August 5th and it is really

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
[Amit Varma]: interesting because I can imagine someone starting

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
[Amit Varma]: that rumour because it is sensational and that

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
[Amit Varma]: sells and then it is misinformation

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
[Amit Varma]: where people are spreading it but it is not out of

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
[Amit Varma]: malice. But then there is an element of

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
[Amit Varma]: disinformation because people are actually changing the

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
[Amit Varma]: detail of who the commissioner is and all that.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
[Guest]: Do you have any theories on what is going on here?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
[Guest]: I have no clue. I don't know

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
[Guest]: who would do that, why would do that, what is

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
[Guest]: there to gain? There is no political gain out of it

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
[Guest]: or at least I don't understand if there is a political gain.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
[Amit Varma]: So when I was growing up in the 80s, if the government

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
[Amit Varma]: wanted to make an announcement, you had one television

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
[Amit Varma]: channel, Doordarshan and somebody would come

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
[Amit Varma]: and say okay whatever,

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
[Amit Varma]: typhoon expected here, don't go out or whatever.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
[Amit Varma]: You could do that. Today of course media

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
[Amit Varma]: is completely dispersed and so on.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
[Amit Varma]: How is it then that when misinformation

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
[Amit Varma]: spreads like this, what is it

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
[Amit Varma]: that the government can do to correct it?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
[Guest]: The government has every tool

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
[Guest]: at its disposal. Even now you have

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
[Guest]: All India Radio in villages etc.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
[Guest]: I mean these kind of things,

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
[Guest]: I am not talking about, again there are multiple

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
[Guest]: different strategies needed to counter different

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
[Guest]: kind of misinformation but let's talk about these

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
[Guest]: child kidnapping rumours. There was a person

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
[Guest]: who was killed in Ahmedabad.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
[Guest]: We did a story five days

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
[Guest]: before this person was killed

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
[Guest]: and in a city like Ahmedabad,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
[Guest]: if you can read a WhatsApp forward, you can read a billboard.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
[Guest]: There are billboards at every

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
[Guest]: crossroad.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
[Guest]: All you have to identify is the

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
[Guest]: areas where people

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
[Guest]: are more likely to fall for this misinformation

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
[Guest]: and put billboards

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
[Guest]: that if you come across this, this is false.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
[Guest]: I mean

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
[Guest]: there are so many things that can be done.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
[Guest]: You ask the radio organisations

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
[Guest]: to keep broadcasting it.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
[Guest]: When there is a need to do it, the government

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
[Guest]: finds a way. Even now,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
[Guest]: for example, Odisha is doing such a good job

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
[Guest]: at getting people in

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
[Guest]: shelters because in the last 2-3 years

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
[Guest]: they have been battered with cyclones

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
[Guest]: and floods but they have made sure that people

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
[Guest]: are not caught in the storm

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
[Guest]: and how do you do that? By communicating

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
[Guest]: with people. There are means

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
[Guest]: and ways for the government to communicate with

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
[Guest]: people. You use those same means

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
[Guest]: to fight misinformation. It's just that they

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
[Guest]: have not recognised this

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
[Guest]: as an issue of high

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
[Amit Varma]: priority at this point of time.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
[Amit Varma]: Odisha government is a great example of

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
[Amit Varma]: where there was a will, they actually went out

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
[Amit Varma]: and got it done.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
[Amit Varma]: At the same time, you could say that there is no rule of law

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
[Amit Varma]: in most of the countries.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
[Amit Varma]: This would classically fall under the rubric

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
[Amit Varma]: of you need to maintain the rule of law.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
[Amit Varma]: I want to take you back to a bigger philosophical

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
[Amit Varma]: question and something that you alluded to

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
[Amit Varma]: earlier in the show when you spoke about

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
[Amit Varma]: how the postcard

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
[Amit Varma]: news guy got arrested and at first you

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
[Amit Varma]: welcomed it but then you had second thoughts about it.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, just

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of thinking aloud, I'm a free speech

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
[Amit Varma]: absolutist so I just totally believe

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
[Amit Varma]: in that you should not

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
[Amit Varma]: find reasons to clamp down on the free speech

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
[Amit Varma]: of others. However,

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
[Amit Varma]: there's also the harm principle.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
[Amit Varma]: If someone is actually putting out

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
[Amit Varma]: information that leads to people

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
[Amit Varma]: being killed, whether it's people

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
[Amit Varma]: being lynched or whether it's

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
[Amit Varma]: child kidnapping rumours, if somebody willfully

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
[Amit Varma]: does it, then I believe that the law

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
[Amit Varma]: has a right to sort of take action against him

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
[Amit Varma]: in only those cases where it's

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
[Amit Varma]: direct and it's sort of

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
[Amit Varma]: malified in that sense.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
[Amit Varma]: How has your thinking on this evolved?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
[Guest]: My thinking on this has evolved

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
[Guest]: in the sense that, number one, there's no way

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
[Guest]: to find out who actually put out

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
[Guest]: this information. We are in a world of

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
[Guest]: end-to-end encryption, whether it's WhatsApp,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
[Guest]: Signal, etc.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
[Guest]: So if we ever create laws

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
[Guest]: more specifically to target misinformation,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
[Guest]: number one, what we will be doing

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
[Guest]: is not criminalising misinformation, we'll be

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
[Guest]: criminalising information. Misinformation

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
[Guest]: is a subset of information.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
[Guest]: And so what we will be doing is

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
[Guest]: criminalising information. Now,

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
[Guest]: there are different kinds of rumours. So, for example,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
[Guest]: medical misinformation. When

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
[Guest]: the Nipah virus thing happened in Kerala,

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
[Guest]: a message went viral claiming

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
[Guest]: that if you have

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
[Guest]: Gelsamium 200, a homeopathic

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
[Guest]: drug, it will protect you from Nipah virus.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
[Guest]: Now, Nipah virus had an

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
[Guest]: 85% mortality rate.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
[Guest]: A rumour like this is very dangerous

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
[Guest]: at this point in time. But the people

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
[Guest]: who are forwarding it are again

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
[Guest]: forwarding it from a position

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
[Guest]: of fear and concern.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
[Guest]: That, you know, it might help somebody who I

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
[Guest]: know in Kerala.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
[Guest]: Or, you know,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
[Guest]: there's no malintent here.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
[Guest]: Now, if you create a law which

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
[Guest]: criminalises misinformation

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
[Guest]: or, as I said, information,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
[Guest]: the court is not going to see whether this is

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
[Guest]: political misinformation, whether there's malintent.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
[Guest]: I mean, we know how

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
[Guest]: judiciary works and there's a

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
[Guest]: likelihood that somebody who's just put it out

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
[Guest]: because of genuine concern

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
[Guest]: gets arrested. First of all, you can never find

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
[Guest]: out who started that.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
[Guest]: And the police, just in order

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
[Guest]: to make a case that they're doing something, they'll

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
[Guest]: pick up a couple of people who probably

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
[Guest]: have nothing to do with the starting of the rumour and

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
[Guest]: put them into jail. That is how I

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
[Guest]: see this playing out.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
[Guest]: And, again, the same thing

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
[Guest]: with political misinformation also. A lot of people

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
[Guest]: are just forwarding it. The creators are

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
[Guest]: very few and we don't know who the creators are.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
[Guest]: There's no insight into who the

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
[Guest]: creators are. Most of the people are just

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
[Guest]: forwarding and forwarding. How do you

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
[Guest]: start arresting people

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
[Guest]: just because they're forwarding misinformation?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
[Guest]: And, again, here I have another point to make,

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
[Guest]: which is, if you don't

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
[Guest]: teach a child how to cross a road,

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
[Guest]: you can't blame a child

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
[Guest]: when the child crosses a road and is

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
[Guest]: unable to cross the road. First, teach

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
[Guest]: the child to cross the road.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
[Guest]: We have not taught

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
[Guest]: people how to deal

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
[Guest]: with a world where there's so

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
[Guest]: much excess of information. It's not

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
[Guest]: just misinformation, there's excess of information.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
[Guest]: And how do you deal with it?

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
[Guest]: You have a cough and

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
[Guest]: you go on Google and you say that I have a cough.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
[Guest]: Depending on what

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
[Guest]: sort of mental state you are in, you might

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
[Guest]: conclude that you have cancer or you have

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
[Guest]: an ordinary cough.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
[Guest]: We have not taught people how to deal

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
[Guest]: with a world where there's so much information.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
[Guest]: And in that, when people make

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
[Guest]: mistakes, to criminalize information

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
[Guest]: is something that I cannot support.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
[Amit Varma]: That's a great point and I'll ask you to elaborate

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
[Amit Varma]: on both these sub-points of

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
[Amit Varma]: medical misinformation, number one,

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
[Amit Varma]: and

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
[Amit Varma]: number two, the need for education.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
[Amit Varma]: But before that, is it then fair to sum up your position

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
[Amit Varma]: on this, to

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
[Amit Varma]: say that whether or not a

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
[Amit Varma]: law against willful,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
[Amit Varma]: malified disinformation is justified or not,

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
[Amit Varma]: in practice what will happen is that

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
[Amit Varma]: any such law will become a very blunt

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
[Amit Varma]: tool which is used to randomly

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
[Amit Varma]: crack down on misinformation.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely. And therefore

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
[Guest]: will be a threat to free speech in the hands of the state.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
[Guest]: Yes, and especially

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
[Guest]: again, the way things

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
[Guest]: go about in India, it will be

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
[Guest]: used by the ruling party against people

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
[Guest]: in the opposition. Exactly. So that will

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
[Guest]: also be a consequence of that, that it will be

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
[Guest]: used selectively. I mean

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
[Guest]: the law enforcement agents will

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
[Guest]: not do their due diligence, that is one part, but

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
[Guest]: it will be used selectively by the ruling party

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
[Amit Varma]: against people in the opposition. These are

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
[Amit Varma]: very wise points and I agree with you entirely. Now

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
[Amit Varma]: elaborate a little bit, like most people think of

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
[Amit Varma]: misinformation, disinformation, fake news, whatever

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
[Amit Varma]: right, as something that is political in nature

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
[Amit Varma]: or sensational rumours.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that you've been pointing out

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
[Amit Varma]: to me is that medical misinformation is something

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
[Amit Varma]: that we need to look at very, very seriously. It has

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
[Amit Varma]: grave consequences. Elaborate on that for me.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
[Guest]: So medical misinformation is the other thing

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
[Guest]: that we concentrate on.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
[Guest]: The editor of Alt News Science

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
[Guest]: is Dr. Sumaya Sheikh. She is a neuroscientist

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
[Guest]: based in Sweden.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
[Guest]: It might be interesting to have a conversation with

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
[Guest]: her because she's also working on aggression and things like that.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
[Guest]: But, so

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
[Guest]: medical misinformation is

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
[Guest]: equally dangerous.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
[Guest]: So for example, in Gujarat, in certain

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
[Guest]: villages, there was a rumour that

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
[Guest]: the measles, rubella

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
[Guest]: vaccine, RSS has

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
[Guest]: mixed something in it and

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
[Guest]: people who will take it

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
[Guest]: will become

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
[Guest]: impotent. And the

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
[Guest]: vaccination rates drop dramatically

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
[Guest]: in these villages. Now

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
[Guest]: these are the things which will never get reported by media

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
[Guest]: because you never know how it plays out.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
[Guest]: Political misinformation,

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
[Guest]: you can see how it plays out, but

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
[Guest]: a bunch of kids not

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
[Guest]: taking vaccine and what happens

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
[Guest]: in their life cycle, you will never know.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
[Guest]: You don't know who has taken

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
[Guest]: a vaccine, who has not taken a vaccine, why that

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
[Guest]: person did not take a vaccine.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
[Guest]: When the dengue

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
[Guest]: season happens, there's

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
[Guest]: always this thing that if you have

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
[Guest]: papaya products, it will help

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
[Guest]: in increasing your platelet

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
[Guest]: level. Sumaya wrote an article

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
[Guest]: saying that

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
[Guest]: there's no conclusive research

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
[Guest]: to say that that happens.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
[Guest]: But somebody who falls for that, they may

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
[Guest]: ignore what is

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
[Guest]: the prescribed medication.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
[Guest]: And right now,

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
[Guest]: I would also again blame the government of India

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
[Guest]: for a lot of pseudo-information they have

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
[Guest]: created, that's this entire ministry called

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
[Guest]: Ayush. And there's

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
[Guest]: so much pseudo-information, pseudo-medical

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
[Guest]: information that goes out of it that they are

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
[Guest]: creating a culture of anti-science.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
[Guest]: They are creating a culture of the

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
[Guest]: pseudo-science and that is

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
[Guest]: extremely dangerous.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
[Guest]: And people, again,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
[Guest]: in political misinformation,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
[Guest]: there's a pattern that, as I was talking about, you are

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
[Guest]: weaving a fiction and

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
[Guest]: it follows a pattern. In medical

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
[Guest]: misinformation, there is no pattern.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
[Guest]: Once in your head, you think that

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
[Guest]: papaya cures dengue,

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
[Guest]: you create a video about it, you

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
[Guest]: talk about it, so it disperses

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
[Guest]: without a pattern. And it is

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
[Guest]: extremely difficult to track misinformation.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
[Guest]: A very important aspect

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
[Guest]: of fighting misinformation

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
[Guest]: is the ability to track misinformation.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
[Guest]: And medical misinformation is

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
[Amit Varma]: very, very difficult to track.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
[Amit Varma]: One point you made that I'd like to amplify is

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
[Amit Varma]: that this carries an opportunity cost.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Like when I rail against homeopathy, which is

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
[Amit Varma]: a complete pseudo-sciences nonsense,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
[Amit Varma]: the problem isn't only that the medicine

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
[Amit Varma]: will not work because people assume that,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
[Amit Varma]: okay, sugar pills, what harm can it do?

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
[Amit Varma]: The problem also is that you could be relying

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
[Amit Varma]: on that instead of something that will

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
[Amit Varma]: actually cure you. And the cost of that

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
[Amit Varma]: could even be, and has been, in some cases,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
[Guest]: death. Right. And

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
[Guest]: people say that there are no side

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
[Guest]: effects. Yes, of course, you're going to take sugar, what is

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
[Guest]: the point?

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
[Guest]: Unless you have diabetes or something

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
[Guest]: like that. But these are the kind

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
[Guest]: of theories that are propagated that, you know,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
[Guest]: take it. It has no

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
[Guest]: side effects. And that is a virtue

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
[Guest]: that it is propagated that it has no

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
[Guest]: side effects. But the

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
[Guest]: fact is that, you know, it is not

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
[Amit Varma]: going to cure anything. I mean, just

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
[Amit Varma]: essentially, so how do you sort of fight

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
[Amit Varma]: medical misinformation like this? Like,

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
[Amit Varma]: is it a different kind of battle at Alt News?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, when somebody spreads a picture

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
[Amit Varma]: and says a picture of, you know, a rat,

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
[Amit Varma]: for example, in Muzaffarabad, and you

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
[Amit Varma]: have your tools to do your reverse image

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
[Amit Varma]: searches and you figure out where the image is really from

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
[Amit Varma]: and you can correct it immediately.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
[Amit Varma]: But medical, and I guess you guys

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
[Amit Varma]: are very trained eyes and kind of now

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
[Amit Varma]: being immediately able to spot what is

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
[Amit Varma]: but for medical,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
[Guest]: it must be much harder, surely. It is

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
[Guest]: much, much harder. And the main

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
[Guest]: issue is tracking medical misinformation.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
[Guest]: There's so many videos on YouTube.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
[Guest]: It is impossible to go and listen to every video

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
[Guest]: saying what they are talking about.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
[Guest]: But there is a lot of medical

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
[Guest]: misinformation out there and people are going

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
[Guest]: to YouTube listening to these videos,

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
[Guest]: ghar ke nuske, whatever, you know.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
[Guest]: And, you know, if you have this, this is going to happen.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
[Guest]: And at this point of time,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
[Guest]: we, you know,

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
[Guest]: I think we've had

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
[Guest]: much more strategy in terms of

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
[Guest]: rebelling,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
[Guest]: not the word rebel, but sort of going

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
[Guest]: against political misinformation, but

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
[Guest]: medical misinformation, it is still

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
[Guest]: we are trying to figure out what to do.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
[Guest]: And this especially

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
[Guest]: needs a wider support. Even

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
[Guest]: media organizations are so terrible at reporting.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
[Guest]: Just the other day,

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
[Guest]: somebody said that Tata Salt has

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
[Guest]: cyanide. One gentleman

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
[Guest]: at a press conference said that Tata Salt

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
[Guest]: has cyanide. Everybody printed it.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
[Guest]: Everybody without any fact checking.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
[Guest]: Some university in Jamnagar

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
[Guest]: killed a few cells using

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
[Guest]: cow urine. Times of India has an article

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
[Guest]: next day, cow urine can

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
[Guest]: solve the issue of cancer. So that is

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
[Guest]: terrible, terrible journalism. And

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
[Guest]: we have seen real life impact of it.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
[Guest]: A personal example, there was a person

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
[Guest]: who was working with us

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
[Guest]: in the unions and

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
[Guest]: his son got lung cancer.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
[Guest]: At the same time, my father got lung cancer.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
[Guest]: But it was a less aggressive strain of lung cancer.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
[Guest]: When he eventually died

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
[Guest]: and when he went for his

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
[Guest]: final rites, we were told

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
[Guest]: that the last two weeks of his

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
[Guest]: life, he was fed only cow urine.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
[Guest]: And they

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
[Guest]: starved the person to death.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
[Guest]: And that person was anyway going to

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
[Guest]: die. And you made his last two weeks

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
[Guest]: the most terrible one can imagine.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
[Guest]: But none of this will

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
[Guest]: get reported. Political misinformation

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
[Guest]: has real ramifications.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
[Guest]: It is

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
[Guest]: something that you can observe, but

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
[Guest]: medical misinformation has ramifications

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
[Guest]: in this form. Having in houses

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
[Guest]: across the... and they don't even

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
[Guest]: know that they have been fed misinformation.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
[Guest]: So it will never get reported. So medical

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
[Guest]: misinformation is something we don't recognize.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
[Guest]: And the pseudoscience that we are putting

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
[Guest]: out more and more, and there is so much support

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
[Guest]: for pseudoscience now, that it

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
[Amit Varma]: is very dangerous. And the pseudoscience

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
[Amit Varma]: and these dangerous ways of beliefs are

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
[Amit Varma]: actually embedded in our culture. It's not

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
[Amit Varma]: as if you need a misinformation campaign

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
[Amit Varma]: to get it out. It's more a corrective

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
[Amit Varma]: that you need to take, which brings me to my next

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
[Amit Varma]: question about education. You know, you've pointed

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
[Amit Varma]: out the importance

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
[Amit Varma]: of educating people on how to recognize

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
[Amit Varma]: misinformation, dealing with misinformation.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
[Guest]: Tell me a little bit about that.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
[Guest]: Yes. So there are three parts. So one is

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
[Guest]: we started off as a journalistic intervention,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
[Guest]: Alt News. We've now

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
[Guest]: come up with an app. It's a technological intervention.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
[Guest]: But I think one of the most important

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
[Guest]: things is educational intervention,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
[Guest]: where multiple things can be done.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
[Guest]: So Alt News is planning. These are

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
[Guest]: things that we are planning, have not been executed.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
[Guest]: But over the next five years, we

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
[Guest]: want to go to low-income communities, for example.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
[Guest]: Now these are the communities where

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
[Guest]: we know that the Alt News brand is never going

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
[Guest]: to reach, especially because we can only

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
[Guest]: publish in two languages, English and Hindi.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
[Guest]: And even Hindi is not going

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
[Guest]: that far. So what we realized

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
[Guest]: is that there's

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
[Guest]: a need to create quote-unquote

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
[Guest]: misinformation doctors or

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
[Guest]: Facebook fake news doctors in

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
[Guest]: these low-income communities where you

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
[Guest]: create influencers.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
[Guest]: The way a lot of these rural

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
[Guest]: areas work is that there are social

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
[Guest]: influencers who have a huge

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
[Guest]: impact on the society.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
[Guest]: So what we want to be able to do

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
[Guest]: is go and identify

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
[Guest]: certain individuals in various

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
[Guest]: communities and teach them how

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
[Guest]: to spot misinformation and

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
[Guest]: create a network for them. They may not be able to

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
[Guest]: sort of have

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
[Guest]: access to 100% of misinformation,

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
[Guest]: but through the app that we are creating, we

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
[Guest]: want to create a network for them so that

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
[Guest]: they can query us and sort of say that

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
[Guest]: this is the misinformation that is being

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
[Guest]: circulated in an area. What could be

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
[Guest]: the truth about this and things

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
[Guest]: like that? So we want

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
[Guest]: people to be able to go to this

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
[Guest]: local influencer and ask, is this

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
[Guest]: true or not? This is from

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
[Guest]: the point of view of these child kidnapping rumors, etc.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
[Guest]: If there are enough influencers

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
[Guest]: in a small area where a person

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
[Guest]: can go and ask or when there's a mob

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
[Guest]: going on and somebody can say that, no, look,

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
[Guest]: this is wrong, then I think it will have

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
[Guest]: an impact in terms of local communities.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
[Guest]: Second thing that we want to do

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
[Guest]: is start, create curriculum

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
[Guest]: at school level, especially high school.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
[Guest]: This is the time when your prejudices

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
[Guest]: haven't completely set in.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
[Guest]: And this is the time when a corrective measure will

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
[Guest]: most especially work, whether it is

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
[Guest]: against misinformation in science

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
[Guest]: and health or misinformation in politics

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
[Guest]: and especially science and health.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
[Guest]: So that is where you teach

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
[Guest]: these students and these are also students

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
[Guest]: again, you know, who will have to

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
[Guest]: go to Google and figure out which university

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
[Guest]: they want to join. There will be 10,000 websites

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
[Guest]: which will say this university, this

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
[Guest]: is good, this is good. Now how does

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
[Guest]: a student handle this excess

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
[Guest]: of information? So we also are hoping

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
[Guest]: to deal with that to teach students

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
[Guest]: not only how to spot misinformation

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
[Guest]: but how to handle

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
[Guest]: excess of information. That is at

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
[Guest]: school level. And then

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
[Guest]: we want to concentrate on two things. One is

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
[Guest]: journalism schools where

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
[Guest]: again we are talking with certain universities where

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
[Guest]: we go and create a module, a two-week

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
[Guest]: module or a one-week module where we teach journalism

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
[Guest]: students how to

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
[Guest]: look at misinformation. The hope is

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
[Guest]: that you have more and more people looking at

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
[Guest]: misinformation. There is less and less of

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
[Guest]: misinformation, even though they may not

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
[Guest]: be at editor level, but I think if there is a larger

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
[Guest]: mass of journalists who are able to spot

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
[Guest]: misinformation, there will be a louder

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
[Guest]: voice against misinformation

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
[Guest]: in mainstream media, leading to

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
[Guest]: steady decline of misinformation.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
[Guest]: Mainstream media also puts out misinformation.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
[Guest]: That is also a thing that

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
[Guest]: needs to be done. And second thing is

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
[Guest]: we want to get in touch

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
[Guest]: with people who work on ground, social

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
[Guest]: workers, etc. And teach them how

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
[Guest]: to spot misinformation. And again,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
[Guest]: create a network for all of these. Teach

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
[Guest]: academics because we did

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
[Guest]: some trainings in partnership

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
[Guest]: with Google and Data Leads.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
[Guest]: We taught about 120-odd journalists.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
[Guest]: And what we have observed is the academics

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
[Guest]: who have been the most active in

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
[Guest]: going out and furthering that,

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
[Guest]: taking those trainings and

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
[Guest]: training other people. So we want to

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
[Guest]: teach multiple academics, people who are

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
[Guest]: teaching in those journalism

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
[Guest]: colleges, because once you teach an academic,

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
[Guest]: that person can teach year after year. So it

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
[Guest]: has much more repetitive effect.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
[Guest]: We don't know how far we'll be able to

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
[Guest]: go. This is a massive

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
[Guest]: task that we want to take up. We don't

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
[Guest]: have either the money or resources,

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
[Guest]: but these are things that

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
[Guest]: need to be done. And the hope

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
[Guest]: is that once you start at a small level

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
[Guest]: and you have more people getting into it,

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
[Guest]: then it

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
[Amit Varma]: increases organically.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
[Amit Varma]: Has there so far been any interest for these courses

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
[Amit Varma]: from either journalistic organizations

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
[Amit Varma]: or institutions?

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
[Guest]: Yes, institutions.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
[Guest]: We have spoken to multiple institutions

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
[Guest]: and they are willing to include

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
[Guest]: such a module, one-week

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
[Guest]: to two-week module, where students

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
[Guest]: are taught various tools of how to

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
[Guest]: spot misinformation

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
[Guest]: and things like that. Yes, there has been interest.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
[Amit Varma]: That's pretty amazing. And I'd love to see an online

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
[Amit Varma]: MOOC on it as well, so that people can

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of learn online all the tricks of the trade.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
[Guest]: There are, for example, there's a website

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
[Guest]: called firstdraft.com. They have an online

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
[Guest]: training. They have two trainings. One is

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
[Guest]: a short training and one is

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
[Guest]: a longer training, which is meant for

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
[Guest]: journalists. It's a free training. People just

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
[Guest]: have to sign up for it and

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
[Guest]: they can do that. Something

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
[Guest]: like that can be done at a large

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
[Guest]: level, definitely. But there are already

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
[Amit Varma]: resources out there. Let's talk about

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
[Amit Varma]: the AltNews app, which was

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
[Amit Varma]: just released, which I downloaded yesterday,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
[Amit Varma]: played around a bit with it.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
[Amit Varma]: What was the impetus behind it

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
[Amit Varma]: and what does it do?

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
[Guest]: So, we are trying to solve

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
[Guest]: a small section of the issue of misinformation.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
[Guest]: The

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
[Guest]: observation that we made, that a large

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
[Guest]: majority of misinformation, especially

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
[Guest]: things that get circulated more viral,

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
[Guest]: is in form of images

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
[Guest]: and videos which are circulated with a certain

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
[Guest]: text blurb.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
[Guest]: Usually, the misinformation is in the text blurb.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
[Guest]: That is, you take a video image from somewhere

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
[Guest]: and you say that this represents an event

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
[Guest]: which it does not. So, we saw that

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
[Guest]: a large majority of misinformation

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
[Guest]: is this kind. Now,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
[Guest]: the thing is that, again,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
[Guest]: coming back to technology,

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
[Guest]: Google started, whatever, x number

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
[Guest]: of years ago. It is a wonderful search engine

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
[Guest]: for text. That is, you put in

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
[Guest]: a text, you put in a few keywords and

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
[Guest]: it throws back results.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
[Guest]: But that was okay in

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
[Guest]: a world when the content

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
[Guest]: was text heavy. Now,

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
[Guest]: we are living in a world where the content

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
[Guest]: is image video heavy. There is so much

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
[Guest]: video content, image content

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
[Guest]: being created every single day.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
[Guest]: And again, it brings back to the point of

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
[Guest]: Jio, etc., and cheap mobile phones, that

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
[Guest]: it enabled people to capture videos,

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
[Guest]: capture images, and put it out on

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
[Guest]: social media because of the cheap data connections.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
[Guest]: And,

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
[Guest]: let's say about 20-25 years ago, because

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
[Guest]: camera equipment, all of that was so expensive

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
[Guest]: that most of the video and imagery

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
[Guest]: that was coming out, we knew who was putting out.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
[Guest]: We know the photographer. We know all of that.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
[Guest]: There's proper attribution. But now,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
[Guest]: people just take videos anywhere

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
[Guest]: and you don't know where that has happened. There's no

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
[Guest]: sense of time or place.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
[Guest]: So, there is a need

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
[Guest]: to document videos and images

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
[Guest]: at a large scale and create a

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
[Guest]: search engine against that. So, what this

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
[Guest]: app does is that we are trying to rethink

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
[Guest]: search engine in terms of misinformation.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
[Guest]: We are not a Google where we can create

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
[Guest]: a worldwide image video search engine.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
[Guest]: But what we are doing is we have created a search

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
[Guest]: engine of images and videos

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
[Guest]: against our database of fact checks

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
[Guest]: and we are also taking content from

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
[Guest]: other fact checkers. So,

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
[Guest]: you throw an image or video

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
[Guest]: at this app and if

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
[Guest]: you already fact checked it, it will search against

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
[Guest]: our database using various algorithms

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
[Guest]: to throw back the corresponding fact check.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
[Guest]: And the hope is to do it at a

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
[Guest]: much larger database

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
[Guest]: where we are documenting

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
[Guest]: because there are so many videos

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
[Guest]: especially violent

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
[Guest]: videos that come out these days and

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
[Guest]: we have seen that eventually they become

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
[Guest]: a source of misinformation. So, start

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
[Guest]: documenting all these images and videos

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
[Guest]: even if there's no misinformation

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
[Guest]: corresponding to it, but start

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
[Guest]: documenting that because we ourselves will

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
[Guest]: forget there's so much video inventory.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
[Guest]: I have only, you know,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
[Guest]: these days we can look at a video

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
[Guest]: and say, okay, we saw it at this point in time, but

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
[Guest]: eventually it will be impossible to

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
[Guest]: do that just because there's so much

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
[Guest]: inventory. So, if we start documenting

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
[Guest]: it now, even though we

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
[Guest]: have debunked a video, let's say, two years ago,

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
[Guest]: I might forget two years down the line, but I can

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
[Guest]: throw a video at this app and it will

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
[Guest]: give me a result that, look, you wrote a fact check

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
[Guest]: for it two years ago. So, that is

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
[Guest]: what we are trying to do with this

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
[Guest]: app, that is create a video

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
[Guest]: slash image search engine

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
[Guest]: at a limited level against what

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
[Guest]: things that are typically

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
[Guest]: being used for misinformation

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
[Guest]: or have a

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
[Guest]: proclivity to be used for misinformation

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
[Amit Varma]: in the future.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
[Amit Varma]: And does the app also serve as

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
[Amit Varma]: a means for people alerting you to

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
[Amit Varma]: stories you might not have already covered,

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
[Amit Varma]: but alerting you that, hey,

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
[Amit Varma]: here's this image that came on WhatsApp,

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
[Amit Varma]: is it kosher? And even if you haven't

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
[Amit Varma]: already done it, do you then get those

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
[Amit Varma]: images and decide if you should do a story on it?

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
[Guest]: So, there's a separate app that we will

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
[Guest]: create for it. We are calling it the

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
[Guest]: Misinfo Scanner. So, like the virus

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
[Guest]: scanner, where that

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
[Guest]: will be proactively looking at your gallery

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
[Guest]: and we won't be uploading images or videos,

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
[Guest]: but it will be like you have been exposed to

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
[Guest]: misinformation, that kind of a thing.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
[Guest]: That is another idea that we are

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
[Guest]: working on, that, again, all this

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
[Guest]: database that we are collecting, there's

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
[Guest]: an API layer. Essentially, this

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
[Guest]: is a layer which answers to the question,

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
[Guest]: what is the fact check corresponding to this image or video?

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
[Guest]: Now, this layer can be connected to

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
[Guest]: various things, like a Twitter bot or Facebook

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
[Guest]: Messenger bot, but one of the applications

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
[Guest]: that we are thinking is a Misinfo Scanner.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
[Guest]: You install this application and it will keep looking

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
[Guest]: at your gallery. It is not going to upload your images

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
[Guest]: and videos, so there's no issue of privacy

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
[Guest]: getting compromised. It is going to upload

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
[Guest]: only certain parameters of those images and videos,

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
[Guest]: and if we determine that you received

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
[Guest]: a video which

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
[Guest]: has been circulated with the element

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
[Guest]: of misinformation, we'll alert you.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
[Guest]: So, I

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
[Guest]: am quite excited. Hopefully, that

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
[Guest]: app will come out in another six to eight months.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
[Guest]: So, that will be sort of proactively

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
[Guest]: telling people that, look, there's misinformation.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
[Guest]: So, when they go back to their WhatsApp

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
[Guest]: groups, they'll say, oh, I saw this.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
[Guest]: Audience has already done an article. Let me push

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
[Guest]: an audience article, and then they can use

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
[Guest]: this other app to look for a fact check

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
[Guest]: corresponding to misinformation. So,

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
[Guest]: there are things that can be

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
[Guest]: done in technology to

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
[Guest]: sort of push back against misinformation.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And it also strikes me that, you know, you've been a

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
[Amit Varma]: pioneer on all this in building

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
[Amit Varma]: these systems, building AltNews.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
[Amit Varma]: You've practically, you

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
[Amit Varma]: know, made it a mission to do all of this.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is that any big media

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
[Amit Varma]: company, if it had the will, could

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
[Amit Varma]: also have done all of this. And I think at some

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
[Amit Varma]: level, you would be very glad if AltNews

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
[Amit Varma]: wasn't needed, if people were doing it

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
[Guest]: all over the place and it... Absolutely.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
[Guest]: And, again, it

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
[Guest]: goes back to the not-for-profit. So, we created

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
[Guest]: a not-for-profit knowing that we cannot have

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
[Guest]: 100 employees. We can have 15 to

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
[Guest]: 20 employees max, because that is,

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
[Guest]: you know, crowdfunding cannot

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
[Guest]: fund a 100-employee company.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
[Guest]: So, which means that we can

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
[Guest]: never imagine to have an impact

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
[Guest]: that mainstream media does.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
[Guest]: So, who do we impact? We impact

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
[Guest]: the mainstream media. That is, we create

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
[Guest]: models which others can follow.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
[Guest]: So, AltNews started as a fact-checking

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
[Guest]: thing. Now, Times of India is fact-checking, India Today

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
[Guest]: is fact-checking, ThenxJargon is fact-checking.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
[Guest]: That is where I take, you know, I think

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
[Guest]: Timelive and AltNews can take some credit that

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
[Guest]: it is we who forced them into fact-checking.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
[Guest]: You know, it is we who created the model

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
[Guest]: and forced them into fact-checking. Similarly,

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
[Guest]: in case of this app, I won't say

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
[Guest]: media companies, but I would say tech companies.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
[Guest]: They could have given us an app, something

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
[Guest]: like this. It's a very simple thought.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
[Guest]: It is not a complicated thought, right?

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
[Guest]: You know that there's more image and videos

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
[Guest]: and you need a search engine to figure out

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
[Amit Varma]: image and video. It's a very simple thought. I mean, you can build

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
[Amit Varma]: it into Google for that matter, the Google app itself.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
[Guest]: Yeah. So,

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
[Guest]: now, so what we are trying to do is

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
[Guest]: create this and then create

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
[Guest]: all these applications at Twitterbot.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
[Guest]: So, let's say you tag AltNews

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
[Guest]: where the Twitterbot is being developed right now.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
[Guest]: So, let's say you tag AltNews on a video image.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
[Guest]: If you have fact-checked it, it will give you an automated

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
[Guest]: answer, right? Now, create

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
[Guest]: all these things and then tell

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
[Guest]: the tech companies that, look, we have

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
[Guest]: done this. Why haven't you done this?

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
[Guest]: So, that is what we are trying to do. Again,

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
[Guest]: when it comes to the educational initiative,

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
[Guest]: create a module, create a model.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
[Guest]: If you can successfully implement

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
[Guest]: it in one small section,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
[Guest]: then, first of all, you know that

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
[Guest]: there is a success story there, that we could implement

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
[Guest]: it in this one small section, and

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
[Guest]: that ways of replicating it

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
[Guest]: otherwise. When a

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
[Guest]: neighboring district sees that, okay, this has implemented,

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
[Guest]: let me do that. And as it grows,

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
[Guest]: the hope is that the model gets replicated.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
[Guest]: So, as a small

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
[Guest]: not-for-profit website, the

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
[Guest]: focus will always be on creating

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
[Guest]: models that can be replicated

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
[Guest]: because we can never imagine

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
[Guest]: having an impact with people who

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
[Guest]: have a lot of money. So, create models

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
[Guest]: and hope that others sort of take those

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
[Guest]: models and go further.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
[Amit Varma]: Prateek, now I'll segue into

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, as we approach the end of the episode,

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll segue into the personal and just

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
[Amit Varma]: ask you, Ratman, you know, you live in

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Ahmedabad, for God's sake.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
[Amit Varma]: There have been threats against you.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, to me, you're one of the

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
[Amit Varma]: bravest people in the internet space

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
[Amit Varma]: in India. How do you deal with it?

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, do you feel scared sometimes? Do you feel

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
[Amit Varma]: worried? Does it impact your social

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
[Amit Varma]: life or the way you live?

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
[Guest]: Number one,

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
[Guest]: first of all, you know,

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
[Guest]: we are publishing, writing, talking in English.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
[Guest]: We are talking to a largely

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
[Guest]: urban, middle-class crowd.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
[Guest]: That is a privilege in itself. We have seen

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
[Guest]: so many people getting

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
[Guest]: killed in India, in

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
[Guest]: rural areas. You know, somebody covering

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
[Guest]: a mining story, that person is

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
[Guest]: a truck runs over that person. We've forgotten.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
[Guest]: I don't remember the name of the reporter,

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
[Guest]: right? Because that person was

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
[Guest]: never there in the urban

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
[Guest]: scape. So this privilege itself

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
[Guest]: gives you a sense of immunity that

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
[Guest]: if tomorrow something happens to me,

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
[Guest]: probably there are journalists who have done

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
[Guest]: much more work, but if

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
[Guest]: something happens to them, they will

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
[Guest]: be forgotten. But because I have

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
[Guest]: these 150,000 followers on Twitter

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
[Guest]: that I'm tweeting

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
[Guest]: every day and people know me by name and

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
[Guest]: some people know me by face, so that

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
[Guest]: is a privilege in itself. So that is one

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
[Guest]: thing. So I think

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
[Guest]: threats against

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
[Guest]: journalists in urban areas as opposed

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
[Guest]: to rural areas, people play up the threats

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
[Guest]: against people in urban areas much

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
[Guest]: more. What people in rural areas, journalists,

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
[Guest]: string reporters, are at

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
[Guest]: much more danger of having

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
[Guest]: physical elimination. Second

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
[Guest]: thing is that when it comes

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
[Guest]: to a physical threat, it doesn't matter where you

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
[Guest]: are, whether in Ahmedabad, whether

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
[Guest]: in Bangalore. We saw what happened to Gauri

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
[Guest]: and we have seen that. So location

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
[Guest]: doesn't matter. The only thing

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
[Guest]: that matters at that point of

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
[Guest]: time is, again, something that

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
[Guest]: I have learned from my parents, and

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
[Guest]: my mother is the director of the company

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
[Guest]: and she is the rock behind the company who

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
[Guest]: makes sure that we don't falter.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
[Guest]: And that is finances. That is having

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
[Guest]: everything spick and span when it comes

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
[Guest]: to finance. So for example, we have donations,

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
[Guest]: we don't take a single rupee of cash donation.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
[Guest]: The bank has given

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
[Guest]: ratified, made

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
[Guest]: sure that only the right kind of people

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
[Guest]: make bank accounts. We ask them to

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
[Guest]: donate. It's online donation.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
[Guest]: It comes to a bank. There's no cash

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
[Guest]: transaction whatsoever. So

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
[Guest]: that is what we're doing. We're keeping everything

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
[Guest]: spick and span, paying our taxes, doing

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
[Guest]: everything. So

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
[Guest]: again, these are experiences

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
[Guest]: that are not necessarily mine.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
[Guest]: These are experiences which my

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
[Guest]: parents have been sort of working against.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
[Guest]: In 17, there was no BJP government

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
[Guest]: in Gujarat. It was Congress government.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
[Guest]: BJP government came only in 95, and the

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
[Guest]: organization is working since 79.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
[Guest]: They have the experience of working against various

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
[Guest]: establishments, and that

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
[Guest]: experience is an extremely

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
[Guest]: important experience which

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
[Guest]: can be sort of taken ahead for

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
[Guest]: different such causes.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
[Amit Varma]: And to a lot of people listening

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
[Amit Varma]: to this episode, you're already a hero.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to embarrass you, but I'd call you one of the

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
[Amit Varma]: heroes of modern India. But I actually have

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
[Amit Varma]: a question for you, which is a

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
[Amit Varma]: functional question, which is that

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
[Amit Varma]: if people listening to this are convinced

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
[Amit Varma]: by this cause and they want to help you, they want to help

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
[Amit Varma]: AltNews, they want to

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
[Amit Varma]: help all the things that they're doing, how

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
[Guest]: can they do so? So various

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
[Guest]: ways. So for example, if you're

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
[Guest]: somebody who's a software programmer,

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
[Guest]: we need help in

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
[Guest]: developing more of these tools. We are going to open

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
[Guest]: source all of this. AltNews, again,

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
[Guest]: something that...

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
[Guest]: AltNews, all the things that we have written,

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
[Guest]: it's always under an open license. So

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
[Guest]: our content is under Creative Commons license. We

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
[Guest]: have never charged a single penny for our content.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
[Guest]: We always say, take our content, do whatever you

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
[Guest]: want to do with the content.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
[Guest]: So let's say if people want to translate that content,

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
[Guest]: take our content, translate it in your local

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
[Guest]: languages, put it out in our portals.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
[Guest]: Just all we need is credit.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
[Guest]: It was originally written by AltNews,

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
[Guest]: but start translating content

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
[Guest]: in your local languages.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
[Guest]: If you're a techie, we need help in

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
[Guest]: terms of being able, getting

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
[Guest]: software help. It

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
[Guest]: becomes a challenge to organize people coming from

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
[Guest]: different people, and we have not figured out

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
[Guest]: a way...

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
[Guest]: We are actually getting a lot of help. A lot of

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
[Guest]: people email me saying that, I want to help you,

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
[Guest]: I want to help you. The problem is, how do you manage

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
[Guest]: all of these people in different places?

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
[Guest]: In Ahmedabad, all of us sit in a small

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
[Guest]: office and you can shout across,

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
[Guest]: but when people are in geographically

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
[Guest]: different areas, the managerial

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
[Guest]: overhead increases. So we have not

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
[Guest]: figured that out, but

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
[Guest]: there are various ways in...

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
[Guest]: If you're an academic,

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
[Guest]: we want to come out and

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
[Guest]: train you all.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
[Guest]: If all academics can come together,

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
[Guest]: it's easier for us to train 30 academics

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
[Guest]: sitting in one room and telling them that this is

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
[Guest]: how you look at misinformation.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
[Guest]: There are a variety of things that can be done,

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
[Guest]: and I don't think

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
[Guest]: all the ideas and solutions need to come from here.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
[Guest]: People are very ingenious

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
[Guest]: when it comes to these things, and they will have

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
[Guest]: their own ideas of how to do things.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
[Guest]: The thing is to

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
[Guest]: do things at small levels and

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
[Guest]: we can bring those efforts together

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
[Amit Varma]: under a platform.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
