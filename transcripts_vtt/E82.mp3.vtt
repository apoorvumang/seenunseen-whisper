00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:27.000
[Amit Varma]: One of the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.800
[Amit Varma]: great dilemmas of politics is the question of when a politician finally comes to power,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.360
[Amit Varma]: does his focus shift to governance, or does it stay with politics? Does he try to do a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.560
[Amit Varma]: good job running the country, or does he simply focus on what will get him re-elected? In

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.120
[Amit Varma]: an ideal democracy, you might imagine that this is a false choice. Surely a politician

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.560
[Amit Varma]: in power has to provide good governance to stay in office, right? Well, not in our democracy,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.680
[Amit Varma]: where there is so little connect between power and accountability. Firstly, many good governance

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.680
[Amit Varma]: decisions will show results many years down the road, well beyond the electoral horizon,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.360
[Amit Varma]: and the politician has no incentive to make them now. The deeper structural changes, with

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.400
[Amit Varma]: their delayed and invisible benefits, for which no one man will get credit, will not

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.400
[Amit Varma]: attract the politician, but the immediate sops or handouts, which look good but perpetuate

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.560
[Amit Varma]: the problem, will be more attractive to him. Secondly, we live in an age where narrative

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.920
[Amit Varma]: is all-powerful. We all live in a world inside our heads that often bears no connection to

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.080
[Amit Varma]: the real world outside it. This is enabled and amplified by social media. The most important

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.120
[Amit Varma]: skill for a politician, therefore, is to shape these narratives and not change the world.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.640
[Amit Varma]: And that is why it is no surprise that a politician as skilled as Narendra Modi cares more about

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:52.080
[Amit Varma]: optics than about governance. One example of this, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.240
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.320
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Varma.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.960
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan sounds amazing, but it's a

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.960
[Amit Varma]: classic example of a government scheme whose intentions are noble, but whose outcomes are

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.040
[Amit Varma]: small. To explain why this is so, I have as a guest on this episode, Shruti Rajgopalan,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.880
[Amit Varma]: a constitutional economist who teaches economics at Purchase College in New York and who has

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.400
[Amit Varma]: been an old friend and a frequent guest on this show. I recorded this episode a few weeks

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.020
[Amit Varma]: ago when I was experimenting with this new format of chatting a little bit with my guests

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.360
[Amit Varma]: about themselves before we got to the subject at hand. I've since stopped this practice

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.480
[Amit Varma]: because listeners gave me feedback that they preferred it if we just got to the point.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.120
[Amit Varma]: But still, this is one of those old recordings from that phase. I enjoyed our entire conversation.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.360
[Amit Varma]: But before we get to it, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.880
[Amit Varma]: If this happens to be the only podcast you listen to, well, you need to listen to some

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.400
[Amit Varma]: more. Check out the ones from IVM Podcast who co-produced the show with me. Go to ivmpodcast.com

[Amit Varma]: IVM podcast app today. Shruti, welcome to the scene in the unseen. Hi, Amit. It's great

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.960
[Amit Varma]: to be here. Shruti, by now you're familiar with the custom on the show that I start off

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.640
[Amit Varma]: by asking the guest some questions about themselves so that listeners can get to know them better.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:56.240
[Amit Varma]: And last time when we spoke to you, you spoke about your love for economics and law and

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.560
[Amit Varma]: what drew you to becoming an economist. And I want to sort of ask what is a follow up

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.060
[Amit Varma]: question to that, which is that, you know, I've known you for over 10 years. And one

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.480
[Amit Varma]: thing that is safe to say, and that will be obvious to listeners who've heard your previous

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.800
[Amit Varma]: episodes is that economics is not just a profession for you or something that you've studied.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.480
[Amit Varma]: You are deeply passionately in love with economics the way some people are with say football.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.600
[Amit Varma]: So was there a specific moment or an aha moment in your life, where things changed for you,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.600
[Amit Varma]: you looked at the world differently because of economics and realized that this was what

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.080
[Guest]: you wanted to do? I think I, you know, if I had to have one aha moment, I had a fantastic

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.960
[Guest]: professor in DU in my second year. His name is now he's retired. He's Professor Anil Kukradi.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.640
[Guest]: And just like, you know, one of the kindest people I know, and just a really remarkable

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.920
[Guest]: teacher. And for the first time, I remember in his class for me, like the world kind of

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.600
[Guest]: came into sharp focus. You know how when you wear glasses, and you go to the eye doctor,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.000
[Guest]: they they keep putting different lenses on you. And it's all hazy and bright. And then

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.920
[Guest]: suddenly the world comes into focus and you can read those letters. So that sort of happened

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:17.400
[Guest]: to me when I was a student at DU. He was just an incredible professor. The other part of

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.120
[Guest]: it was just reading. You know, I loved economics so much. I read broadly, I read well outside

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.760
[Guest]: the curriculum, the DU curriculum was quite sad. So I read a lot. And I think we underestimate

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.480
[Guest]: how important simple economic texts are. So Henry Hazlitt and his economics in one lesson

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.040
[Guest]: made a big impression. Right? Similarly, Thomas Sowell's work has made a huge impact in how

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.240
[Guest]: I think about the world. Frederick Bastiat would be another example, you know, just people

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:53.320
[Guest]: who write complex economic concepts in a simple and very enjoyable way. And slowly I started

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.480
[Guest]: seeing economics and everything. The other thing is I'm trained at George Mason, which

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.480
[Guest]: is a particular tradition in economics, you know, in terms of public choice, Austrian

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.560
[Guest]: economics and things like that. But one thing at George Mason, I don't know if it's in the

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.640
[Guest]: water or the air. Everyone just lives and breeds economics in that department. We see

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:17.640
[Guest]: economics in everything, right from marriage markets to betting markets to political markets.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:26.600
[Guest]: Everything is an incentive analysis. So I, I guess I found my people. And this is what

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.800
[Guest]: I discussed all the way through grad school. And after a point, you know, when you do something

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.000
[Guest]: enough, when you read enough, it just becomes a way of thinking. And people who are close

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.320
[Guest]: to me, my friends, my family, they often make fun of me that I just sort of see economics

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.680
[Guest]: and everything. But I don't know if it's a switch that I can turn off now. I think I

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.640
[Guest]: think it's been switched on and might stay like this for a long time.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.680
[Amit Varma]: No, and I mean, economics is a study of human behavior. So economics is in everything, except

00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:01.040
[Amit Varma]: maybe outer space. But so if an enthusiastic listener of these episodes was to ask that,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.840
[Amit Varma]: hey, economics sounds very interesting. And the economic way of looking at the world is

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:11.480
[Amit Varma]: something that, you know, I want to understand better. And can you recommend, say, three

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.840
[Amit Varma]: books or five books, which can help me do that? Like, what are those three books I should

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.080
[Amit Varma]: take with me to a holiday resort and lock myself up with and I'll come out a different

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.680
[Amit Varma]: person looking at the world through clear lenses? What would you recommend?

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.160
[Guest]: So I would definitely recommend economics in one lesson by Henry Hazlitt, like that

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.160
[Guest]: is a beginner's textbook, I think anybody can read it, it doesn't matter whether you've

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.640
[Guest]: had any background in economics or social sciences before this, that would be a good

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.680
[Guest]: place to start saying pick up any book by Thomas Sowell.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'll interject here and point out that economics in one lesson by Henry Hazlitt,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.760
[Amit Varma]: one of my favorite books as well is based on an essay by Frederick Bastia inspired by

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.920
[Amit Varma]: an essay by Frederick Bastia called that which is seen and that which is not seen, which

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:02.120
[Amit Varma]: is unseen, which is also the inspiration for this podcast, because that magnificent essay

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.720
[Amit Varma]: and it's free online. So just do a Google search that which is seen and that which is

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.720
[Guest]: not seen. And yes, sort of talks about

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:14.600
[Guest]: I don't want to reduce economics only to incentive analysis and the analysis of unintended consequences.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.800
[Guest]: Absolutely. But I do think economics is very powerful compared to any other discipline

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.080
[Guest]: in pointing out what are these unintended or unseen effects. And I don't think any other

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:32.560
[Guest]: discipline comes close. It's like having a superpower, you know. So I really strongly

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.840
[Guest]: urge everyone to read both Frederick Bastia, the essay that, you know, Amit mentioned,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.840
[Guest]: and after which the podcast is named, and also Henry Hazlitt's book.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.120
[Amit Varma]: Great. And moving on from there, you were mentioning Thomas Sowell.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:52.120
[Guest]: Yeah, I would say pick up anything by Thomas Sowell. He's great. He's sort of like, I think

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.760
[Guest]: the core of good economic ideas is there in pretty much anything he writes. But he's also

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.360
[Guest]: someone who's able to see the big picture very clearly. So there's a lot of politics,

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:08.240
[Guest]: there's a lot of culture, there's a lot of history included in how he sees things and

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.240
[Guest]: the way he writes. He writes beautifully. So I would definitely recommend him. If you're

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:19.040
[Guest]: not much into reading, and you know, you like videos or interviews and podcasts and things

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.720
[Guest]: like that, I would say Amit's podcast is a good place to start. Econ Talk, which Russ

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.680
[Guest]: Roberts does is a great place to start. Yeah, Marginal Revolution University, these are

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.400
[Guest]: former professors of mine at George Mason, Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok, who really

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:39.040
[Guest]: don't need any preface or introduction. They do some fantastic videos, their book is really

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.360
[Guest]: good. I use their textbook to teach. So these would be like the principles level things.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.760
[Guest]: I would also say, you know, reading a couple of great essays, I think the use of knowledge

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:55.080
[Guest]: in society by Hayek is one of the finest essays I have read on really understanding how the

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.640
[Guest]: market system works. Same thing, you know, James Buchanan wrote a fantastic essay called

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.840
[Guest]: politics without romance, and introduction to public choice and constitutional economics.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.420
[Guest]: And I can provide links for both of them, Amit, and you can just put them up. Those

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.680
[Amit Varma]: are really good sources. We'll have them at the bottom of this episode. In fact, the use

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.540
[Amit Varma]: of knowledge in society, in my opinion, is what I keep telling people is one of the two

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:22.300
[Amit Varma]: great essays of the 20th century. Now, let's see how you know, I must agree. Can you guess

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:29.720
[Amit Varma]: which is the other one on my list? The Candlemakers petition? No, 20th century, 20th century, 20th

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.760
[Amit Varma]: century. The other one has nothing to do with economics. So I must tell you, but you'll

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.800
[Guest]: say aha when I tell you. Yeah, but I'm so one dimensional. I don't know if I know things

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.680
[Amit Varma]: outside of economics that you read. You read so broadly. You don't know me at all. It's

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.720
[Amit Varma]: politics in the English language by George Orwell. Oh, of course, you've sent it to me.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.360
[Amit Varma]: That's true. That's a fantastic essay. That's a remarkable essay. And both of those, by

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.200
[Amit Varma]: the way, on the site, I edit Pragati at thinkpragati.com. We have a section called Historia, where every

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.960
[Amit Varma]: month we put up one historic essay, which in over the past months has included the use

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.080
[Amit Varma]: of knowledge in society by Hayek, which is such a masterpiece of an essay, politics in

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:14.640
[Amit Varma]: the English language by George Orwell and the essay by B.R. Ambedkar that moved you

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.960
[Amit Varma]: so much and that you referred to in our episode about caste, which is when I decided to look

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.320
[Amit Varma]: it up because to my shame, I hadn't read that yet. And then we put it up on the site. So

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:30.520
[Guest]: do check out. You know, I just think Ambedkar is one of the, one of the best communicators

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:37.120
[Guest]: I have read. I'm a really big fan of Ambedkar. Our economics and politics don't always align,

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.560
[Guest]: but I have never come away from reading Ambedkar without learning anything. And I think he's

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.880
[Guest]: the most underappreciated of our framers when it comes to actually reading what he's written,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:53.880
[Guest]: like he's there in every statue at every street corner. But I do think we need just Ambedkar

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:59.440
[Amit Varma]: to be widely read. So let me ask you a question this time for my own edification rather than

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.600
[Amit Varma]: my listeners, which is a genuine question I have, which is that Ambedkar's body of work

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.640
[Amit Varma]: is just immense and varied. And it's very common for people to say that you can, if

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.080
[Amit Varma]: you read all of his work, you can find justifications for anything in some part of his work or the

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.640
[Amit Varma]: other because, you know, he's changed his mind many times. He's gone over so many subjects.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:24.080
[Amit Varma]: But if someone wants a good rigorous introduction to Ambedkar, where should he start? What should

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.080
[Amit Varma]: he read?

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:32.200
[Guest]: I would actually, you know, Ambedkar has this phenomenal ability to write short essays,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.400
[Guest]: letters, give speeches, right? So there are these volumes, it's called Ambedkar writes

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:43.520
[Guest]: and Ambedkar speaks. They are very massive volumes. They were edited by Narendra Jadhav.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.640
[Guest]: But if you just pick up a single essay on the monetary system, it's only three pages

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:54.760
[Guest]: and immensely accessible and readable, right? So I strongly recommend people just Google

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.280
[Guest]: Ambedkar's essay on whatever issue they are interested in, whether it's caste, whether

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.440
[Guest]: it's taxes, whether it's the Sedition Act, you know, just Google what he's written and

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:09.520
[Guest]: just start reading. I often say this to people that I think Ambedkar would have been fantastic

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:16.840
[Guest]: on Twitter. You know, he came up with like really powerful punchlines, which he delivered

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:22.080
[Guest]: so well when he was giving speeches. So I really miss Ambedkar in present day, not just

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.800
[Guest]: because he's such a towering and important figure, but I think his communication skills

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.040
[Guest]: were so fantastic, he would have been great on Twitter. So I think just pick up, just

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.960
[Guest]: Google Ambedkar's speeches and just start reading Ambedkar in Parliament.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.640
[Amit Varma]: I'm already fantasizing about Ambedkar coming as a guest on the scene in the unseen, but

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.640
[Guest]: moving on.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.600
[Guest]: You know, one of my favorite Ambedkar quotes is the caste system is not just the division

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.200
[Guest]: of labor, it's a division of laborers. Can you think of a better way to think about the

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.200
[Amit Varma]: caste system?

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.200
[Amit Varma]: Superbly Pithi.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:59.480
[Guest]: Right? So he's just such a fantastic communicator. I just wish, you know, I know people read

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.800
[Guest]: the 2500 volumes of Gandhi's letters. And you know, I mean, kudos to them. I'm happy

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.960
[Guest]: those things are read. But I still think Ambedkar is just under read and underappreciated as

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:14.360
[Guest]: a thinker, you know, not as a political figure or someone who unified the various castes

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.760
[Guest]: and who was important in framing the democracy just as an intellectual, a homegrown Indian

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.760
[Guest]: intellectual, I think he's very underappreciated.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:26.720
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely. Let's, let's move on now to the subject of this episode, which is something

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.240
[Amit Varma]: which would have interested Ambedkar. And I wonder what he would have thought of what's

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.600
[Amit Varma]: going on in the country right now. And the subject is a government scheme was started

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.720
[Amit Varma]: with the very best of intentions, this Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, of which the scene effect

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.400
[Amit Varma]: as a government keeps tom tomming, of course, is that we have built x number of toilets

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.000
[Amit Varma]: and you know, look what we've and so on and so forth. Tell us a little bit and you've

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.920
[Amit Varma]: written on this yourself in your column in Live Mint, in Mint. And tell us a little bit

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:59.280
[Amit Varma]: more about your feelings about the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.400
[Guest]: So you know, public sanitation is incredibly important in modern civilization, right? No

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:10.160
[Guest]: question about that. We have very low levels of public health and sanitation in the rural

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:16.960
[Guest]: areas. And these have terrible consequences, right? So we have high infant mortality, because

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:23.560
[Guest]: you know, little kids, babies get sick, because the water is polluted or the air is polluted.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.480
[Guest]: If they get diarrhea, they're not able to survive. So there are some really important

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:36.000
[Guest]: and terrible consequences for society in terms of not having a good framework for public

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.480
[Guest]: health and sanitation. So to that end, I really think it's incredible that this government

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:49.660
[Guest]: has taken on a big initiative and said we really need to pay attention and devote resources

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:56.800
[Guest]: and political capital towards cleaning India, right? So I can very much get behind the general

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.920
[Guest]: message of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. I think it's very important. And I don't think it

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.840
[Guest]: should be just these four years and you know, Gandhi's 150th birthday. I think we need a

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.280
[Guest]: Swachh Bharat for all times to come.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.400
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely. And and Shruti in your piece, which is again linked from the bottom of this

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.640
[Amit Varma]: episode is a piece titled, India needs sewage systems, not free toilets. And in your piece,

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.720
[Amit Varma]: you say quote, overall, this which is a Swachh Bharat Abhiyan seems like a well intentioned

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:30.480
[Amit Varma]: and sensible initiative, except for one thing, unquote. So now, elaborate sort of on what

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.480
[Amit Varma]: that one thing is.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:37.040
[Guest]: Yeah. So if you think about what is the end goal to be achieved, if the end goal to be

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:43.680
[Guest]: achieved is to eliminate open defecation, genuinely have, you know, better public sanitation,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.960
[Guest]: I don't think the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in its current form is going to actually achieve

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:53.840
[Guest]: that goal. If the end goal is that toilets need to be distributed to every household,

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:59.000
[Guest]: I think that goal will be achieved. Right. So let me unpack that a little bit more for

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.040
[Guest]: you. Now, what do you really need to eliminate open defecation? So India has one of the highest

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.120
[Guest]: levels of open defecation anywhere in the world. In rural areas, it's higher than 65

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:15.360
[Guest]: percent, or at least it was when the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan started. In urban areas, it's

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:21.000
[Guest]: in, you know, about 20 to 30 percent range. And what we mean by open defecation is people

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.800
[Guest]: just go out and do their business in the open. Now, you live in Mumbai, so you must have

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:32.720
[Guest]: seen people squatting next to the train lines in the morning. Right. This is a very prevalent

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.400
[Guest]: site in urban India. In rural India, they go into, you know, farmland and things like

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:45.520
[Guest]: that. And this is a very big problem because it's difficult to clean up in cultures that

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:53.400
[Guest]: have a lot of open defecation. All the diseases that small babies, women, actually pretty

00:18:53.400 --> 00:19:00.000
[Guest]: much people of any age have happens because the basic water system is polluted. And that

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.480
[Guest]: is because all this, you know, excreta has not been treated because it's open defecation.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:12.000
[Guest]: So this is a very fundamental problem. It has massive health and productivity consequences.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.280
[Guest]: It has very large emotional consequences because it is terrible. I mean, every infant that

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:24.720
[Guest]: can be saved should be saved. And the levels of infant mortality we have in UP and Bihar

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.800
[Guest]: and things like that are quite, quite terrible and embarrassing in the modern world. So this

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:35.160
[Guest]: has very deep, important consequences for India. Now, how do you solve for this? How

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:41.320
[Guest]: does anyone solve for this? One way of solving for this is we build waste management systems.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:46.960
[Guest]: And you know, you and I have had lots of conversations about what is the role of government, you

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:51.040
[Guest]: know, what should government do in society at the local, state, federal level and so

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:57.840
[Guest]: on. And I think one really important public good that the government must provide is a

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:04.520
[Guest]: good waste management system. It is very costly, difficult and problematic for every household

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.200
[Guest]: to have its own waste management system. Frankly, it's also quite like, you know, unappealing

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:15.520
[Guest]: and a little bit disgusting. So the role of government should be to design waste management

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:21.360
[Guest]: systems where all you need to do is every household is plugged into that system. Right.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:27.600
[Guest]: So in urban areas, this can be a functional sewage system. Right. In rural areas, it could

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.720
[Guest]: be something on a smaller scale. It might be difficult to build large scale sewage systems

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:38.080
[Guest]: because hamlets might be far apart. But you can still have some kind of a simpler version

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.920
[Guest]: of a sewage system with, you know, an end area where you collect the refuse in a septic

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:50.560
[Guest]: tank or take it to another location before you treat it and so on. And this service has

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.800
[Guest]: not been provided, not just by this government, but any government in the past. So your larger

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.480
[Amit Varma]: point is that, look, it seems natural that people are doing open defecation. And it seems

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.360
[Amit Varma]: natural that, hey, if you build toilets, they'll have toilets to go to. They'll go there. But

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.040
[Amit Varma]: then the point is, once they do their business inside the toilet, what happens then? What

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:12.920
[Guest]: happens to the waste as it were? And that is what you need to build. Exactly. So now

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.880
[Guest]: the way I think about this Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is it's a good initiative. But what it's doing

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.080
[Guest]: is it's solving the last mile problem. Right. My point of view is, if we had functional

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:27.480
[Guest]: sewage systems in urban areas and waste management systems in rural areas, it is actually not

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.640
[Guest]: that expensive to construct a toilet or a latrine. In fact, the last mile problem would

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:37.280
[Guest]: take care of itself. Exactly. So India is already at a level of development where most

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.160
[Guest]: people don't need a toilet subsidy if there is a waste management system that they can

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.440
[Guest]: easily access. Right. And yes, there might be 20 percent of the people who still need

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:51.120
[Guest]: a toilet subsidy. And I think at that stage, I would very much encourage any government,

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.480
[Guest]: state, federal, local to, you know, help build subsidized toilets and so on. But right now,

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.560
[Guest]: we are actually creating a new kind of problem. OK, and it's funny. We were talking about

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:09.040
[Guest]: Ambedkar just a few moments ago. So now India has deep persistence of the caste system.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:15.720
[Guest]: Right. One very important part of the caste system is ritual purity and what certain castes

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:21.480
[Guest]: consider polluting behavior and so on and so forth. Right. Many of the historically

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:27.600
[Guest]: oppressed castes were oppressed either into doing all these distasteful jobs or were oppressed

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:33.200
[Guest]: because they took on these jobs. Right. So the lowest caste in society, in fact, these

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.240
[Guest]: are castes that weren't even allowed to live in the village system. They were outcasts

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:42.640
[Guest]: to see what is now called manual scavenging. Right. They were manual scavengers. What they

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.200
[Guest]: would do is there would be an outhouse at the back where people did their business and

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.200
[Guest]: it would be collected and these people would not even be allowed to enter the house. They

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.240
[Guest]: would just come from the back. They would pick up all the human refuse and they would

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:00.520
[Guest]: take it literally like carry a tank or a basket on the head and go to the next house. Right.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:07.080
[Guest]: Now, you can imagine how terrible it is to have a profession dedicated to having to carry

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:14.240
[Guest]: someone else's feces in your hands. Right. And now you can also imagine that in a culture

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.360
[Guest]: which is so obsessed with the caste system and ritual purity, how groups would treat

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:25.440
[Guest]: people who actually engage in this activity as as a form of livelihood. Manual scavengers

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:33.960
[Guest]: were treated abominably in India. Right. And the system came about simply because there

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:39.800
[Guest]: was no other waste management system. So now, if you think about the long term consequences

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.160
[Guest]: of having only a latrine in the house and not a waste management system, what we're

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:49.080
[Guest]: doing is we're bringing back manual scavenging. It's actually coming back. So now there are

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:54.080
[Guest]: two types of consequences of having toilets, but no waste management system. One consequence

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.600
[Guest]: is people are just using those toilets as storage units or, you know, to keep your provisions

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.920
[Guest]: or wash your clothes or something. And they actually still do their business out in the

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:08.440
[Guest]: open. Right. So toilets are there, but open defecation hasn't reduced. The other group

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.240
[Guest]: is they do decide to use the latrine or the toilet that has been built by the government,

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:20.480
[Guest]: but they don't want to touch anything to do with their own feces. So now what happens

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.960
[Guest]: is you perpetuate the caste system by bringing back manual scavenging, which, by the way,

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.760
[Guest]: was abolished many decades ago in India. So that is one of the unintended or the unseen

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:35.840
[Guest]: consequences of building toilets without building sewage systems. What people really want. So

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.880
[Guest]: you. OK, so let me put this in perspective. In an ideal world, you want people not to

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:47.760
[Guest]: have all these ridiculous ideas about ritual purity. You want people to make use of latrines.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.000
[Guest]: You want people not to openly defecate. OK, that's the ideal world. We don't live in the

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:01.000
[Guest]: ideal world. We live in a deeply. Backward society from the point of view of caste. Right.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.200
[Guest]: And it is so persistent and it is impossible to break down overnight. People who have these

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.960
[Guest]: kinds of values about ritual purity, though I don't subscribe or endorse any of them,

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:18.480
[Guest]: they would actually use the latrine or the toilet that was built at home. Were it connected

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:24.280
[Guest]: to a sewage system where you could just flush the refuse away? Right. And that system we

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:29.640
[Guest]: don't have right now. And until we get that system, you're going to have lots of toilets,

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.360
[Guest]: but you're not going to solve the public health and sanitation problem. And if you do manage

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.240
[Guest]: to solve the public health and sanitation problem a little bit, you're going to have

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.000
[Guest]: a whole class of workers who are oppressed once again because of manual scavenging. In

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.040
[Amit Varma]: fact, you know, that's a very unintuitive conclusion in the sense that a sewage system

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.160
[Amit Varma]: is not just something that will help with hygiene and public health, but it will also

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:54.920
[Guest]: help in eliminating the caste system. It really would. In some small way. In some small way.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:59.560
[Guest]: And at the very least, even if it doesn't eliminate it, at least it won't perpetuate

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:06.320
[Guest]: it. Right. Right. We really have to worry about, and especially at the rural level,

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:12.440
[Guest]: you know, in places like UP and Bihar, where the caste system is very persistent, open

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:19.160
[Guest]: defecation is very persistent, and you have very low levels of, you know, economic growth.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:24.840
[Amit Varma]: This is the trifecta for caste oppression. Right. And we'll take a slight literary digression

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.560
[Amit Varma]: here. Have you heard of Pablo Neruda, the poet from Chile? Yes. Yeah. So there is a

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.800
[Amit Varma]: story of Neruda and you mentioned, you know, outhouses and how these scavengers were looked

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.260
[Amit Varma]: upon as almost subhuman in a sense. And there is a story of how when Neruda was a young

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:42.320
[Amit Varma]: man in his 20s, and is related by Neruda himself in his autobiography, if I remember correctly.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:49.160
[Amit Varma]: And Neruda was posted to Sri Lanka as some sort of ambassadorial kind of, you know, some

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:54.440
[Amit Varma]: part of their foreign office or whatever. And he lived in a house which had an outhouse

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:59.280
[Amit Varma]: at the back for doing the business. And he was curious about how every day I do my business,

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.120
[Amit Varma]: but when I come the next morning, it's pick and span, it's clean. So one day he decided

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:10.600
[Amit Varma]: to find out. And he saw this dark skinned lady walking up taking his refuse and just

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.920
[Amit Varma]: going away. And for some reason, being of a poetic temperament or whatever, he fell

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.800
[Amit Varma]: in love or rather one should say he fell in lust with her. And he waited like that for

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.480
[Amit Varma]: three, four days, and she would come at the crack of dawn, take away his business as it

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.080
[Amit Varma]: were, and just go away. And then one day, he just held her by the hand, took her inside

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.680
[Amit Varma]: to his bedroom, and he had sex with her. And it was obviously rape, because he described

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:38.840
[Amit Varma]: how she just lay inert with no expression on her face and not even resisting, which

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:45.080
[Amit Varma]: kind of tells you about a the power dynamic involved and be also the fact that these people

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:51.800
[Amit Varma]: were considered subhuman. So it didn't, you know, they had no agency, and there was no

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:57.720
[Amit Varma]: trace of empathy in him, as you would expect for another human being, which is why decades

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:02.840
[Amit Varma]: later, when he's a renowned Nobel Prize winning poet, he actually writes about this openly

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:09.320
[Amit Varma]: without any trace of remorse in his autobiography, which which is just remarkably shocking. And

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.480
[Amit Varma]: which, you know, tells you so much about the man himself. I mean, one can't read his poetry

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:19.360
[Amit Varma]: in the same light after that. But it also illustrates what you were saying about the

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:25.600
[Amit Varma]: inequities of the caste system. And to some extent, those inequities being perpetuated

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:32.480
[Amit Varma]: or being made explicit by sort of the physical logistics of this outhouse outside and the

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:38.600
[Guest]: person who comes and collects human refuse before people wake up.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:44.000
[Guest]: And you know, I mean, of course, the men are treated terribly, the women are always treated

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.960
[Guest]: worse, there is a very, very big problem of rape against by upper caste, I say upper caste

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.960
[Guest]: and lower caste, not because I think these are upper or lower caste, it's just, that's

00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:00.360
[Guest]: the vocabulary use. But people who think that they're of an upper caste, there's a lot of

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:06.320
[Guest]: rape of Dalit women by people higher up in the power structure. But there's also a rape

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.360
[Guest]: problem with open defecation. Exactly. You know, women have to go outside at like 4-430

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:17.040
[Guest]: in the morning, it's dark, there is a lot of sexual abuse that happens because we haven't

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:23.000
[Guest]: provided even the most basic types of sanitation system so that women can be safe.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.680
[Amit Varma]: Exactly. And this is a point you'd recommended I read the superb book which I ended up doing

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.040
[Amit Varma]: called Where India Goes by Diane Coffey and Dean Spears. And they make pretty much the

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:37.560
[Amit Varma]: same points about open defecation and ritual purity that you've just explained.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:42.680
[Guest]: And you know, that book is really fantastic, for multiple reasons, because the authors

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:48.520
[Guest]: never came to the subject, wanting to write about the caste system, they came to the subject

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:54.360
[Guest]: as health economists, right? They were trying to understand high levels of infant mortality

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:59.160
[Guest]: and just, you know, the health problems in these developing areas. And what they discovered

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.160
[Guest]: was, oh, there are all these toilets being built. But you would think people would just

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:11.160
[Guest]: jump at it. And it would be a superior alternative to open defecation. But it's actually an inferior

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:16.120
[Guest]: alternative to open defecation, because they live in a world where the caste system persists.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:22.280
[Guest]: And they are not allowed to touch their own refuse. And if they do, then there are questions

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.840
[Guest]: about their purity, and they have polluted themselves and things like that. And what

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:33.840
[Guest]: I love about the book is, it places what is a development or an economic problem, beautifully

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:39.600
[Guest]: in the social context within which we are trying to solve that problem. So you can't

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:45.920
[Guest]: have solutions to these problems by ignoring what is the local or the social context, right?

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:51.880
[Guest]: The caste problem in UP, you don't have this problem in fishermen hamlets in Tamil Nadu.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:58.640
[Guest]: They are perfectly fine. They have eliminated open defecation. And they don't have this

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.880
[Guest]: problem of ritual purity and things like that. They may have other caste issues, but this

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:08.920
[Guest]: is not one that is highly persistent among them. So I think we really need to think about

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:13.920
[Guest]: public health, public sanitation, in a very local contextual manner. And to that extent,

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:18.920
[Guest]: I would I would recommend everyone reads this book. It was my pick for the best book written

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:24.080
[Guest]: last year. The book is called Where India Goes. It's very accessible.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.080
[Amit Varma]: It's a book called Where India Goes by Diane Coffey and Dean Spears. And there'll be a

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:33.400
[Amit Varma]: link to the Amazon page on it below the podcast. We'll take a quick commercial break, and then

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:39.200
[Amit Varma]: we'll come back to talk to move on from economics and the social issues of this and talk a little

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:44.440
[Amit Varma]: bit about the politics and the public choice angle.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.080
[Unknown]: So it's going to be a great week on IBM. This week, we have a brand new podcast launching

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.120
[Unknown]: Facebook and Instagram.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.600
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm talking with Shruti Rajgopalan and we're discussing

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:06.520
[Amit Varma]: India Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which achieved the very feel good, look nice kind of outcome

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:12.040
[Amit Varma]: of building a huge number of toilets across the country. And you would assume that that

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:18.520
[Amit Varma]: helped with solving our sanitation problems, which are also massive public health problems.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:24.400
[Amit Varma]: Because as Shruti explained, open defecation leads to a public health crisis, it affects

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:29.240
[Amit Varma]: child mortality, kids actually dying much younger than they otherwise would. And it's

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:34.320
[Amit Varma]: a humanitarian issue. And you would think logically that if people don't have toilets

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.080
[Amit Varma]: in their home, you're building them toilets, that's surely great. But as Shruti pointed

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.560
[Amit Varma]: out, the unseen side of this is that with the toilet, you're just solving the last mile

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:46.400
[Amit Varma]: problem that show the guy can go to the toilet and do his job. But what happens after that?

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:51.280
[Amit Varma]: What happens with, let's say the refuse that he's left there, if you don't have a good

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.400
[Amit Varma]: waste disposal system, if you don't have a good sewage system, then that necessarily

00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:01.880
[Amit Varma]: means that his refuse has to be cleaned either by himself or by somebody else. And that has

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:08.080
[Amit Varma]: led to a return of manual scavenging and some of the worst of the caste system as an unintended

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:14.680
[Amit Varma]: consequence. And therefore the answer lies in building sewage systems and waste disposal

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:20.600
[Amit Varma]: systems and the toilets will take care of themselves once the infrastructure is in place.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.160
[Amit Varma]: Is that an accurate summation, Shruti?

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:28.560
[Guest]: Absolutely. I would also add one line that you know, we can also think about education,

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:34.640
[Guest]: educating people about the myths of all this ritual purity nonsense. So I would also support

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:41.320
[Guest]: educating people about the caste system and why, you know, manually pumping out or cleaning

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:46.920
[Guest]: out your latrine doesn't make you impure and actually protects your family better. So I

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.160
[Guest]: would say that is also a good way to go. But our education system is so badly broken, I'm

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.160
[Amit Varma]: not holding my breath.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.960
[Amit Varma]: And even apart from that certain religious and traditional beliefs, whatever you call

00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:01.240
[Amit Varma]: them, are often immune to education, because we are still a deeply superstitious society

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:06.800
[Amit Varma]: with all kinds of ludicrously irrational beliefs about everyday life.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:12.560
[Guest]: Absolutely. And you know, of all the things, this is generally so unpleasant. I don't have

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:17.800
[Guest]: any of these ritual purity beliefs, right? But this is generally such an unpleasant area

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:24.000
[Guest]: that any excuse you can get to not have to touch feces is, you know, people are just

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
[Guest]: going to sort of jump on it. I'm just talking from a human nature perspective, right? No

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.480
[Guest]: one is very excited about manually pumping out a used latrine.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:37.200
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, I would say that, you know, invoking natural selection that a disgust towards feces

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.280
[Amit Varma]: is selected for because obviously, if you handle your own feces, you're likelier to

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.720
[Amit Varma]: fall ill and so on and so forth that affects your survival. So it's selected for its naturalist

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.840
[Amit Varma]: instinctive and there's nothing wrong with it. But the point is that if you just had

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:54.320
[Amit Varma]: a good waste disposable waste disposal system, you wouldn't need to touch your own feces

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.600
[Amit Varma]: or to get someone else to do it. You just pull the flush. And exactly.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.680
[Guest]: And also a question of equipment and training and things like that, right? There are there

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:07.840
[Guest]: are many solutions between open defecation and a sophisticated sewage system that New

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:13.680
[Guest]: York City has. So there are many intermediate levels of waste management systems which require

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:20.400
[Guest]: resources and local context and training the, you know, municipality workers on how to use

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.040
[Guest]: them. And we don't have we don't pay any attention to any of those things.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:29.680
[Amit Varma]: So we are 71 years past independence. Why haven't we done it yet? Like, let's not talk

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.880
[Amit Varma]: about this government or that government or Nehru versus Modi. It's been 71 years. Everyone's

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.220
[Amit Varma]: had a shot at it. Not much movement has happened. Why is that?

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:41.740
[Guest]: So the number one reason and you know, Amit, you and I have spoken about this personally

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:48.080
[Guest]: and also on the podcast. The number one reason is we, until very recently, did not have a

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.320
[Guest]: functional layer of local government. These are problems that are meant to be resolved

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:58.000
[Guest]: by the local government. You can't have the central government trying to figure out that

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.160
[Guest]: in the south bungalow area, you know, do we need to build a new sewage system or extend

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:09.360
[Guest]: the pipeline for the new building to be connected? These are local problems. They need local

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:14.920
[Guest]: solutions. We didn't have local government. That is a very, very big part of the problem

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:20.280
[Guest]: and extremely underappreciated, especially in rural areas. Now, we've had a local government

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:25.440
[Guest]: system for about 25 years. We just celebrated the 25th anniversary of, you know, the panchayati

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:30.600
[Guest]: raj and urban local body, the constitutional amendments, which were the 73rd and 74th amendment.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:35.720
[Guest]: So we created a layer of local government, but we didn't give them any responsibility,

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:42.240
[Guest]: nor did we give them any revenue raising authority. You and I have done a podcast on this before.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:47.320
[Guest]: So basically, you have local governments today, but they have no budgets, right? And the state

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:52.640
[Guest]: government has just held on to power and revenue, and they haven't devolved responsibility or

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:58.840
[Guest]: the budgets to these local governments. So I would say the number one blame sort of I

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:04.520
[Guest]: would place on why we don't have good local public sanitation systems is because we never

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.480
[Guest]: had good local government, we never invested in that layer of government.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.640
[Amit Varma]: So we've done a podcast on this earlier, which is one of my favourite episodes. In fact,

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.040
[Amit Varma]: it's an episode on urban governance, if you just go to seen unseen.in, you can find that

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.080
[Amit Varma]: in the archival episodes, I don't remember the episode number. But let me quickly try

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:27.040
[Amit Varma]: and sum up the sort of insights that you gave us in that episode, where your whole point

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:31.400
[Amit Varma]: was that when it comes to local governance, urban or otherwise, there is a disconnect

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:36.560
[Amit Varma]: between power and accountability, who's accountable to us, your local corporator, and so on, they're

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:41.080
[Amit Varma]: all accountable to you, you vote for them, they depend on your votes to get get to office.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:46.160
[Amit Varma]: But who has a power over you, these guys don't really have much power, because local government

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:51.440
[Amit Varma]: in our constitution and in our system, simply hasn't been given that much power, all the

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.360
[Amit Varma]: power is really with the state government. And when it comes to, for example, a city

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.640
[Amit Varma]: like Mumbai, the state government is not so accountable to you, because it depend more

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:05.160
[Amit Varma]: on rural votes or votes from outside the city, and on different constituencies, like there'll

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:10.280
[Amit Varma]: be a constituency of farmers, and so on and so forth. And when you have local problems

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.880
[Amit Varma]: that need to be solved, the person who is accountable to you doesn't have the power

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.880
[Amit Varma]: to solve them. And the people who do have the power and the budgets to affect your lives

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:26.040
[Amit Varma]: don't care about you, because your vote doesn't matter to them. Is that an accurate summation?

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.440
[Guest]: That's an accurate summation. I would also add one one last point, which is, you know,

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.440
[Guest]: you live in Andheri. Andheri doesn't have much of an open defecation problem, as far

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:38.520
[Guest]: as I know. It has other problems, garbage collection, poor sidewalks, you know, those

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:44.080
[Guest]: kinds of problems. So if you were to now talk about open defecation, maybe that's a problem

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.960
[Guest]: in rural Maharashtra. It's very difficult for people like Amit living in Andheri to

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:55.300
[Guest]: coordinate with people in rural Maharashtra and put together a platform when their local

00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:01.480
[Guest]: problems are so different. They are going to be asking for really basic things, right?

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.860
[Guest]: Like how can we secure a well, and you are asking for far more sophisticated things.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:10.640
[Guest]: So not only does your vote matter less at the state level, it's far more difficult and

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:16.680
[Guest]: far less likely to organize different groups because they have very different local problems

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.840
[Amit Varma]: which are highly contextual.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.960
[Amit Varma]: So the ideal system of government, therefore, is obviously as local as possible. And we

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.800
[Amit Varma]: are planning to do an episode on Panchayati Raj. So, you know, watch out for that in the

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:31.520
[Amit Varma]: coming weeks. But the ideal government is as local as possible. So people within an

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:37.360
[Amit Varma]: area know what their immediate concerns are, and they can make sure that their government,

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.960
[Amit Varma]: which is accountable to them, will actually do those things. And for that, they need to

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:47.320
[Amit Varma]: have the power to do those things. And that power has never been devolved to local governments

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:51.080
[Amit Varma]: at all, because the central and the state governments, obviously, anybody who has power

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.200
[Amit Varma]: is hesitant to give away a part of it.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:58.120
[Guest]: Exactly. So in one sense, you know, Prime Minister Modi and his team, which is running

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:03.880
[Guest]: the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, they are definitely quite sensible. They know that they can't

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:09.240
[Guest]: build waste management systems. So they say we'll build toilets instead. Right. So they

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.520
[Guest]: are actually quite sensible in that they are trying to solve the problem that you can actually

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:18.360
[Guest]: implement at the central level. So to that extent, the program is an enormous success.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.640
[Guest]: But the program is an enormous failure if the goal is actually public sanitation and

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.120
[Guest]: public health. Right. Because it's never going to solve it unless you have local partners

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:33.160
[Guest]: who can help convert this network of latrines into a sensible waste management system. So

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:39.000
[Guest]: that is really the core of the conundrum that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan poses. It's a great

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.760
[Guest]: idea. It's important to solve the last mile problem. But you have to solve the last mile

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:51.160
[Guest]: problem last. And you can't ask PM Modi to solve the initial first hundred mile problem

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.440
[Guest]: because it simply can't be done at the centralized level. It has to be devolved to the local

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.440
[Amit Varma]: level.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.840
[Amit Varma]: I'll both back you up and take a cynical view of that. My criticism of the Modi government

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:04.080
[Amit Varma]: right from 2014 is that they have never got into governance mode. They have continued

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.080
[Amit Varma]: in campaigning mode, which they are incredibly good at. And pretty much everything they do

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.920
[Amit Varma]: at the level of governance is for the sake of optics. So even in the Swachh Bharat campaign,

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.680
[Amit Varma]: is great optics that, hey, we've built so many million toilets and it looks great and

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:21.160
[Amit Varma]: you can declare it a success. But they don't really care beyond that, which I think is

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.600
[Amit Varma]: a cross against them. At the same time, I'll agree with you and say that as far as solving

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.800
[Amit Varma]: the deeper problem of public sanitation is concerned, that yes, the central government

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:34.880
[Amit Varma]: can't really do much, you're spot on about that. But at the same time, the central government

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:40.640
[Amit Varma]: could accept the structural problem, which is preventing that the whole issue that local

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.000
[Amit Varma]: governments don't have enough power, or enough power hasn't devolved down to local governments,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.080
[Amit Varma]: and do something about solving that structural problem, which is not something I see either.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.600
[Guest]: Absolutely. There, I must agree with you both the central and the state level. And here

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:59.800
[Guest]: I pose even more emphasis on state level legislatures and executive, which is they really need to

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:05.600
[Guest]: get their act together and recognize that local governance problems can never be resolved

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:11.800
[Guest]: at that level of centrality. And you know, Indian states are larger than most European

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:18.080
[Guest]: and Latin American countries in terms of size and population. So even at the state level,

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:25.040
[Guest]: it's like trying to build a, you know, a sewage system for Brazil, or Germany. So it's not

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:30.400
[Guest]: like the state level is some chota level in India, right? It's still a very, very complex

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:37.800
[Guest]: system with very large area and very large population and diversity in population, lots

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.880
[Guest]: and lots of local issues. So I think there needs to be a recognition of this in India,

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:47.800
[Guest]: that the level of complexity that the Indian polity poses, and I don't see any of that

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.480
[Guest]: at the central or the state level at this point in terms of devolution.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.880
[Amit Varma]: And another thing that we don't see and explain to me why that is so, is that normally you

00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:00.600
[Amit Varma]: would imagine that when there is such a far reaching problem of public health, when you

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:05.360
[Amit Varma]: know, babies die younger than they need to, when, you know, it's a humanitarian crisis

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.360
[Amit Varma]: in a manner of speaking that's continued on for more than seven decades, you would imagine

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:14.400
[Amit Varma]: that citizens would take a stand and they would be constant more chars and her nose

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:19.800
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth till something is done about it. But even citizens don't seem to

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:27.160
[Guest]: excuse the phrasing give a shit about this. So, you know, I find citizen apathy is very

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:33.520
[Guest]: contextual. You know, my parents recently moved to a condo building in Noida, you know,

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:38.800
[Guest]: it's all the typical things you would associate with a middle class or an upper middle class

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:45.840
[Guest]: condo society, right? It's got all these buildings and they have a whole co-op and a voting system

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.280
[Guest]: where, you know, all the people get together and they raise their voice over daily issues.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:55.640
[Guest]: When I go to one of those meetings, it's like my blood pressure goes up. People are so passionate

00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:01.320
[Guest]: about, you know, should this be the entry gate and the exit gate or only the entry gate,

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.720
[Guest]: right? How many speed breakers should we have in front of which of the buildings should

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:10.200
[Guest]: you have the speed breaker so that, you know, children are not faced with the fast traffic

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:15.120
[Guest]: coming in and outside the parking garage? Should you have a water desalination plant?

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:20.800
[Guest]: Because that's a big problem in Noida. People are deeply passionate, like deeply passionate.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:27.720
[Guest]: They shout, they yell, they politic, they, you know, have parties with other association

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.240
[Guest]: members where they say, this is Noida, they probably murder as well. Yeah. So this is

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:38.080
[Guest]: incredible. And when I think about why isn't it that these people are doing this with the

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.040
[Guest]: Noida Municipal Corporation, they're like upper middle class people who don't even go

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:48.640
[Guest]: to vote. It's because they pay condo association fees. And the condo president lives next door,

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:52.840
[Guest]: right? And the whole board membership lives next door. So if your governance problems

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:57.240
[Guest]: aren't solved, you just pick up the phone and go badmouth them. And if they are solved,

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:02.880
[Guest]: then you host a dinner party for them. Right. And you pay your fees. There's a huge link

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:08.320
[Guest]: between what you pay and what you get. The feedback mechanisms are very tight at the

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:14.240
[Guest]: local level. Right. So I think we need to put citizen apathy in context. Of course,

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.240
[Guest]: there is citizen apathy in Andheri. No one knows the name of the municipal corporator

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.440
[Guest]: because no one has to, because he can never solve these problems or she can never solve

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:29.360
[Guest]: these problems. Whereas the president of the condo association in Noida can and does.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:33.560
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, the residents of the condo association in Noida, what they are

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:37.080
[Amit Varma]: doing is simply they're demanding a bank for their buck, they pay those fees, they want

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:43.360
[Amit Varma]: those services. And yet somehow at the level of the citizen, we seem to have this, we disassociated

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:49.240
[Amit Varma]: ourselves from the fact that we also pay a constant cost for government and yet we don't

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:54.640
[Amit Varma]: demand enough in return. We take taxes for granted, even though they are coercive and

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.640
[Amit Varma]: mostly highly unfair. And we don't get any bank for our buck. And also we take the government

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:04.840
[Amit Varma]: for granted. And we assume that, you know, we behave essentially like subjects that whatever

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:08.580
[Amit Varma]: is done for us, you know, it's great, it's a bonus. But otherwise, we don't stand up

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:13.440
[Guest]: and demand our rights enough. But even there, Amit, there's a centralization problem. You

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:18.280
[Guest]: don't know who you're paying tax to, you don't know where it's going. There is a Swachh Bharat

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:22.880
[Guest]: cess that goes to the central government, right? If your local municipal corporator

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:28.880
[Guest]: and the local municipal body had the authority to levy taxes and raise taxes, you will also

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.600
[Guest]: be marching in Nandheri. Or if not you, a bunch of other people, right? Saying, dude,

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:39.080
[Guest]: you raised our local taxes, and you didn't clean the garbage. So you really need to think

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.920
[Guest]: small at this level. Right. And so,

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:46.600
[Amit Varma]: your point is that the apathy is rational, because we know that we can't do anything

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:50.680
[Amit Varma]: anywhere. Protest is pointless. So people we can protest to are powerless to do anything

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.120
[Amit Varma]: about it. And your argument is that we would be less apathetic if the structure of government

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.120
[Amit Varma]: changed.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:02.720
[Guest]: Exactly. So I don't see this level of apathy. I mean, look at Indians on Twitter, look at

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:07.680
[Guest]: Indians at their dinner parties, look at Indians at their condo association meetings, they

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:12.440
[Guest]: don't come across as apathetic. In fact, you know, the Amartya Sen version of the Indian,

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:19.440
[Guest]: the argumentative Indian, that is a much more fitting description, because we discuss, we

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.520
[Guest]: fight, right, passionately, emotionally.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.880
[Amit Varma]: On Twitter, you don't have the argumentative Indian, you have the abusive Indian or the

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:26.880
[Amit Varma]: virtue signaling Indian.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.880
[Guest]: You have all sorts of Indians, right?

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.880
[Guest]: Yeah, it's very hard to find a good argument.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:34.880
[Guest]: But what I mean is, it is not a, it's not fundamentally, we're not culturally apathetic,

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:41.600
[Guest]: that Indians are apathetic. I think it's contextual, you're apathetic when you know that your voice

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:46.200
[Guest]: will not be heard, and there is going to be no feedback coming from the other side. So

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:52.640
[Guest]: you try once or twice, and then you give up. And when your voice can be heard, you do use

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:57.320
[Guest]: your voice and you do demand change. So I think we really need to think about structure

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:01.920
[Guest]: of government and, you know, just better systems of local governance. And, you know, at the

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:06.780
[Guest]: local level, you can also experiment more, right? Andheri East and Andheri West are large

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:10.320
[Guest]: enough that you can have two different kinds of local governments, and then you can see

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:15.200
[Guest]: which one worked better. So you can have more experimentation, you can have a greater level

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:21.360
[Guest]: of addressing the local problem in the local context, you can experiment with tax rates,

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:26.800
[Guest]: right? You have far more competition, political competition at the local level. And we have

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:33.600
[Guest]: basically not capitalized on this incredibly important political mechanism.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:37.720
[Amit Varma]: In fact, Andheri West and Andheri East together have more than four times the population of

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:43.680
[Amit Varma]: Iceland. I pointed this out recently after Iceland held Argentina to a draw, I think

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:47.320
[Guest]: it was on Twitter. Yeah, not even half as good a football team. Yeah, no, no, I didn't

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.680
[Amit Varma]: even mention that. I just said to put it into perspective, Iceland has less than a quarter

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:55.240
[Amit Varma]: of the population of Andheri. And these words were meant as praise for Iceland to put their

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:59.840
[Amit Varma]: achievement in context. And instead, everybody assumed I was being anti national and dissing

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:04.920
[Amit Varma]: India and I got hugely trolled for it. So not the argumentative Indian, but the abusive

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:09.920
[Amit Varma]: Indian. But sort of go back to the sort of the public choice question of that and I won't

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.960
[Amit Varma]: ask you to spend much time on this because we discussed it in our episode on urban governance

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:19.920
[Amit Varma]: already. But for listeners who might not have heard that, how can this be mitigated? Like,

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:24.280
[Amit Varma]: obviously, then the solution is clear that you need more power to devolve to local government

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:31.480
[Amit Varma]: so that your local representative actually has the power to do anything, has actually

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:37.720
[Amit Varma]: the power to do what her constituents desire. But is this ever likely to happen? Because

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:43.240
[Amit Varma]: it strikes me that those who have that centralized power are never going to give any of it up.

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.520
[Amit Varma]: How can those incentives change?

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:50.640
[Guest]: I definitely think one thing that's going to happen is the switch from, you know, right

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:56.960
[Guest]: now, urban issues are not addressed at all. And rural issues are much more on the on the

00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:03.120
[Guest]: table for state legislatures. But that said, this is a rural issue as well. But this is

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.120
[Guest]: a universal issue.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:10.160
[Guest]: Absolutely. But what I mean is, I do see a switch happening, that state governments will

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:15.520
[Guest]: recognize urban problems a little bit more than they did before. Now, having said that,

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:21.840
[Guest]: I don't see any incentive for them to devolve power. I think what needs to happen, I think

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:28.280
[Guest]: the impetus has to come from a few great women and men. You know, just so the constitution

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:33.520
[Guest]: leaves the option open to devolve power, right? It doesn't stop you from doing it, but it

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:39.240
[Guest]: doesn't make it mandatory. So there is the question of, I think we need some good state

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:45.160
[Guest]: chief ministers who say, you know what, we're going to devolve these four areas to local

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.960
[Guest]: government, and then let's see how it plays out. Because there's nothing constitutionally

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:56.240
[Guest]: preventing them from doing so. So I do think we need some good show of leadership at the

00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:00.400
[Guest]: state government level. And frankly, we've had a great run with, you know, I mean, we

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:06.080
[Guest]: have a wide variation in quality of chief ministers. But we've also had good ones, you

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:10.920
[Guest]: know, not just bad ones. You had states where you actually had better local governance,

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:16.160
[Guest]: right? Kerala is an example. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, the southern states are much better on local

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:21.560
[Guest]: governance than the northern states are. So you do have some good examples where obviously

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:27.640
[Guest]: the states either invested in local governance even before the 73rd, 74th amendment, or at

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:33.360
[Guest]: the very least embraced this idea that you need to devolve power. I think what states

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:40.540
[Guest]: are not doing is devolving revenue raising authority. I really think one important thing

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:47.120
[Guest]: to do is bring property taxes under GST. But like you have central and state GST, that

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:52.520
[Guest]: should be local GST, that should not go to the state. Right? So it's the same system.

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:57.840
[Guest]: It's just, you know, the same tax rate, but it's who, which is the agency that actually

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:04.200
[Guest]: ends up collecting or getting that revenue. So I think we need to get into a system of

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:11.400
[Guest]: good property taxes, because property taxes are local. People invest in that local area,

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:16.160
[Guest]: and property owners will then demand the bank for their buck, and their vote and their tax

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:20.920
[Guest]: payment will be linked to the same person. Right now, our vote and our tax payment go

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:25.680
[Guest]: to completely different groups. So I really think that is an important step. So, you know,

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:32.080
[Guest]: maybe the GST could also solve this problem by bringing in property taxes under its fold

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:36.000
[Guest]: and implementing it at the local government level. Now, you can imagine the biggest opposition

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.880
[Guest]: to this is state governments, because they lose potential revenue, and they also lose

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:48.720
[Guest]: authority. So they are really what is the, you know, the big interest group, which is

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.880
[Guest]: blocking this kind of thinking.

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:56.220
[Amit Varma]: And at some level, you know, I tend to be a little sceptical of this whole notion of

00:53:56.220 --> 00:54:01.480
[Amit Varma]: relying on say benevolent or enlightened chief ministers to make the changes that are necessary

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.520
[Amit Varma]: because the constitution allows them to. But the fact is that the incentives are against

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:11.360
[Amit Varma]: state and humans react to incentives and something you keep going on and on about and that, you

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:15.680
[Amit Varma]: know, if they just do what the incentives dictate that they will do this will never

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.680
[Amit Varma]: get done. So,

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:22.760
[Guest]: Fair enough, but you know, I also think that there are multiple incentives in politics,

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:26.840
[Guest]: right? So of course, there are the incentives of, you know, protecting your turf and getting

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:32.200
[Guest]: revenue and getting reelected. But I do think a lot of politicians are also interested in

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:37.000
[Guest]: being remembered. They're interested in, you know, entering the history books. I think

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.840
[Guest]: their incentives are much more complex. So I agree with you that there is this whole

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:45.160
[Guest]: public choice thing, and we can't just rely on people's benevolence. But I'm not saying

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:52.120
[Guest]: we should rely on their benevolence. I'm just saying they could have multi dimensions to

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:59.520
[Guest]: how they think they want to be perceived or remembered or reelected. And to that extent,

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:05.140
[Guest]: for some of them, it might be very much in line with devolving power or experimenting

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:10.360
[Guest]: with new, you know, new sort of governance ideas and so on.

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:14.480
[Amit Varma]: And at the local level, even assuming that they were to devolve power, an interesting

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:19.560
[Amit Varma]: point you made earlier when we were chatting about the subject on building a waste management

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:24.920
[Amit Varma]: system is that while the benefits are diffused, the costs are actually concentrated and a

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:31.640
[Amit Varma]: few people feel the brunt of it to begin with, which is, again, a reason for opposition against

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:33.440
[Amit Varma]: it. Can you elaborate on that a bit?

00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:39.040
[Guest]: Absolutely. So you know, there is, I mean, even once you resolve the problem and devolve

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:47.880
[Guest]: power to the local level, there is a current mismatch between the costs and benefits, right?

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:51.440
[Guest]: So when I go to a store and I buy an apple, I pay the cost for the apple and I get the

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:56.120
[Guest]: benefits of the apple, right? So the costs and benefits are perfectly aligned. Now, in

00:55:56.120 --> 00:56:01.600
[Guest]: politics, that's not always the case. And it's really not the case in this particular

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:06.040
[Guest]: instance. So if you need to build a waste management system, it doesn't happen overnight,

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:10.840
[Guest]: right? So in a place like Andheri, if you had to expand the existing sewage system to

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:16.720
[Guest]: accommodate the population growth and the migration, you need to dig up all the roads.

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:21.400
[Guest]: Now, I have been to Andheri and I have driven there in traffic and it's already a nightmare.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:26.000
[Guest]: You know, when the metro and things were being built, it was just a nightmare to navigate

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.360
[Guest]: the streets of Andheri. So now you have a situation where all the costs are imposed

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:36.400
[Guest]: in the present, right? All the roads are dug up right now. All the benefits come in the

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:42.240
[Guest]: future. Babies 10 years from today will have, you know, low levels of infant mortality,

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:46.880
[Guest]: low levels of vulnerability to public health problems. And those babies will work 20 years

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:53.080
[Guest]: after that, right? 18 years after that. So the benefits are far in the future. The beneficiary,

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:57.400
[Guest]: some of them haven't even been born or are not even in the system yet. All the costs

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:02.580
[Guest]: are upfront today being faced by people who need to get to work fast and things like that.

00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:07.720
[Guest]: So it's obviously a very big problem of, yeah, we would love a sewage system, but we don't

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:13.280
[Guest]: want our street to be dug up, right? In rural areas, there is also a caste dimension to

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:17.520
[Guest]: the problem. They'll be like, you know, the sewage system can't go behind my house. It

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:22.480
[Guest]: can't go under my Tulsi plant, right? There are all those dimensions also to think of.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:29.840
[Guest]: So there is a lot of opposition to spending the money and the time that needs to be devoted

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:35.280
[Guest]: to building a waste management system because it involves some kind of disturbance of current

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:40.400
[Guest]: infrastructure. So all the costs are in the present, all the benefits are in the future.

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:45.320
[Guest]: The second problem is all the benefits are dispersed and all the costs are concentrated.

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:49.600
[Guest]: So the benefits are dispersed in the sense that all of us benefit if there is a better

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:53.940
[Guest]: public waste management system because it leads to better public sanitation and therefore

00:57:53.940 --> 00:58:00.740
[Guest]: better public health, right? All of us benefit if babies are not dying under the age of one.

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:05.200
[Guest]: So and all of us also benefit if the groundwater is not polluted because we also access it.

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:14.640
[Guest]: So on and so forth. However, all the costs politically are taken on by the state chief

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:20.840
[Guest]: minister or the local corporator who are implementing the system right now. Because when everything

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:26.280
[Guest]: is dug up, people will protest, they will vote them out, right? And the benefits will

00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:31.440
[Guest]: be reaped by the municipal corporator or the legislator three terms down. Because that's

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:37.200
[Guest]: when we really saw, oh, I know we suffered through all the dug up roads, but how wonderful

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:43.280
[Guest]: it is to have a really functional clean environment. So this problem of dispersed benefits and

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:49.760
[Guest]: concentrated costs and benefits in the future, and costs in the present, this creates a very

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:56.480
[Guest]: big problem. When we are talking about how do we overcome the interest and actually build

00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:01.920
[Amit Varma]: waste management systems. So another way of putting this would be that the benefits are

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:06.680
[Amit Varma]: unseen and the costs are seen. For example, the guy whose infant daughter could be safe

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:10.840
[Amit Varma]: from an early death 10 years later, because of a good sewage system today, he can't possibly

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:15.560
[Amit Varma]: see that now, what he can see is that it's taking him half an hour longer to get to work

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:20.880
[Amit Varma]: because the roads are dug up and so on and so forth. All the inconveniences are obvious,

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:26.460
[Amit Varma]: which then leads us to the pessimistic conclusion that even if the structural problems of local

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:33.680
[Amit Varma]: governance, the sort of the de-linking between votes and money were solved, you would still

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:36.280
[Amit Varma]: have this problem getting in the way.

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:40.440
[Guest]: No, but you know, it can be I think you still have a better shot at solving it at the local

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:45.080
[Guest]: level. So right now, if you think about it, we don't have very good charismatic leaders

00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:50.840
[Guest]: at the local government level. Why? Because there is not much for them to do. And they

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:56.440
[Guest]: don't have much revenue raising authority or responsibility. If you actually build a

00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:02.680
[Guest]: sensible structural system, where local governments become important, then you're going to have

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:07.600
[Guest]: really charismatic people who come in to the local government system and can actually explain

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:13.920
[Guest]: to the people that, hey, I know it feels like a giant problem today, but there will be a

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:18.280
[Guest]: benefit from it. I think Prime Minister Modi is fantastic at this. Look at the rhetoric

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.560
[Guest]: he built around demonetization. I don't personally support demonetization. But look at how he

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:29.500
[Guest]: managed to convince 1.25 billion people that I know it is hugely costly and you're standing

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:34.440
[Guest]: in line, but this is going to be hugely beneficial to the country and we request you to make

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:40.740
[Guest]: this sacrifice. And people fell hook, line and sinker. Right. We shouldn't underestimate

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:47.040
[Guest]: the importance of leaders being able to communicate the value of a good project or in the case

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:52.000
[Guest]: of demonetization, a terrible project. Right. So I really think if we switch the attention

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.120
[Guest]: to the local level, you will get people who manage to overcome these problems simply through

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:04.640
[Guest]: better communication. Have you noticed when there are new buildings being built in Mumbai?

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.520
[Guest]: What happens is they have these huge holdings of how the building will look in the future.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:14.160
[Guest]: Right. So all you see is like this awful structure, but you see this beautiful photograph of kids

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.280
[Guest]: playing in a shining swimming pool and all that. You have entrepreneurs who are able

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.560
[Guest]: to project in the future to help you imagine what you can't imagine yourself. Right. And

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.560
[Guest]: I don't see why you can't have that politics. I just don't think anyone has the incentive

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:34.800
[Guest]: right now to put in that kind of effort and to engage in that kind of entrepreneurship

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:40.320
[Guest]: because nothing is it's not possible to solve anything at the local level. But I do think

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:46.480
[Guest]: if you had a good structure of local government with good authority, I mean, in New York,

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:53.560
[Guest]: Bloomberg ran for mayor. Right. Exactly. There was there was an important job there to be

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:58.040
[Guest]: done, which came with responsibility, which came with power, which came with a certain

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:04.120
[Guest]: reputation. And he didn't run for the Senate. He ran to be the mayor of New York City. And

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:09.860
[Guest]: I don't see why that wouldn't happen if you devolved power and authority and revenue raising

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:15.200
[Guest]: capabilities in India. I do think that can happen. And I think you will see very creative

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:20.720
[Guest]: political solutions on they won't be uniform, but creative political solutions on how to

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.240
[Amit Varma]: solve these problems. I buy your point, though I disagree with your example. I buy your point

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:30.320
[Amit Varma]: that if there is a more meaningful role for local government to play, then better leaders

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:35.520
[Amit Varma]: will emerge, especially people who've experienced problems firsthand, like waste management

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.840
[Amit Varma]: or traffic or potholes or whatever, who will then say, hey, I can finally do something

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.520
[Amit Varma]: about this because local government has a power. Let me go out there and do something

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:48.320
[Amit Varma]: and you know, like in the housing society where your parents stay in Noida, people will

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:53.920
[Amit Varma]: get similarly involved here. So by that point, I don't quite agree with the example of Modi.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:03:00.320
[Amit Varma]: I think this country has suffered too much because he places rhetoric above actual governance.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:06.400
[Guest]: But I understand the sense in which you think it's a good thing in that case. But what I

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:15.000
[Guest]: mean is, we do have an example of a political leader who has told people that there is value

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.960
[Guest]: in their sacrifice. That's not an easy message to sell, if you really think about it, right,

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.640
[Guest]: selling to people that, hey, I know you're waiting four hours in line outside the ATM

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:30.360
[Guest]: and the bank, but it's all for a great cause. And people did it, right? No rioting. That's

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:35.160
[Guest]: the part I want to focus on. Not that demonetization was a good idea, or Modi did a great service

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.920
[Guest]: to India by engaging in that kind of rhetoric. But what I mean is, it can be done. And if

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:46.720
[Guest]: it can be done for a bad idea, I don't see why we can't do it for a good idea, like building

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.120
[Amit Varma]: a waste management system.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.580
[Amit Varma]: On that optimistic note, Shruti, thanks a lot for coming on the scene in the Unseen.

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.200
[Amit Varma]: As usual, I learned a lot from you today.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.520
[Guest]: Thanks, Amit. It was a pleasure.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:33.160
[Unknown]: Hello, I'm Chuck. I'm Srikip. I'm Naren. And together we are the hosts of the podcast Simplified.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:39.200
[Unknown]: And we are going to be doing a hundredth episode, which is going to be a live episode at Doolali

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.320
[Unknown]: in Khar, in Mumbai on the 25th of August, 2018.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.800
[Unknown]: Yes, we should get the year right.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:51.560
[Unknown]: We're going to be doing a lot of fun things at the show. We're going to be talking about

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:56.000
[Unknown]: some stuff, simplifying them. We're going to have a very erudite guest who's going to

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.360
[Unknown]: hopefully make up for our silliness, but we sincerely doubt it.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.720
[Unknown]: And there's definitely going to be a lot of beer. So we really hope you join us.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:08.440
[Unknown]: It'll be fun. And it'll be more fun if you guys are there. So do line up.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:14.280
[Unknown]: See you. Bye-bye.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:22.480
[Unknown]: Some time ago, five successful restauranteurs came together to form the Colaba Cartel.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:27.840
[Unknown]: The founders of the table, Gauri Devi Dayal and Jay Yousuf, partnered with the founders

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:34.800
[Unknown]: of Woodside Inn, Abhishek Honavar, Pankil Shah and Sumit Gambhir to open a new restaurant

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.640
[Unknown]: in Colaba.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:42.720
[Unknown]: If you've ever dreamed of opening a restaurant or love eating out, you want to listen in.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.680
[Unknown]: The Colaba Cartel.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:06:08.200
