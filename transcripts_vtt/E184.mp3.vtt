00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040
[Amit Varma]: One question that all of us have asked ourselves about our own lives is the question, what

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.240
[Amit Varma]: if?

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.400
[Amit Varma]: What if I had done this instead of that?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.360
[Amit Varma]: What if I had chosen another career?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.760
[Amit Varma]: What if I had lived in a different city or not gone on that first date, or was just born

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.440
[Amit Varma]: in a different family?

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.440
[Amit Varma]: What if?

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.820
[Amit Varma]: There's a universe of possibilities in just those words.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.980
[Amit Varma]: And our fascination with those words extends beyond our own lives.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.700
[Amit Varma]: What if the world was a different place?

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.160
[Amit Varma]: We apply this to history sometimes, and that can be a mistake.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.840
[Amit Varma]: The world is complex, but we tell ourselves simple stories to make sense of it.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.520
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, the past has many layers, and we build simple histories to make sense of it.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.080
[Amit Varma]: For this reason, what if questions often don't work?

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.720
[Amit Varma]: Changing one variable in a complex world may not change much at all.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.560
[Amit Varma]: But what if that variable is a big variable?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.880
[Amit Varma]: What if that variable is a Mughal emperor?

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.760
[Amit Varma]: If a tolerant and intellectually curious religious scholar had become Mughal emperor instead

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.660
[Amit Varma]: of an orthodox, bigoted, violent man, would history have proceeded differently?

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.360
[Amit Varma]: If Dara Shikoh had become emperor instead of his younger brother Aurangzeb, would India

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:32.320
[Unknown]: be a different place today?

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.800
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.740
[Amit Varma]: My guest on the show today, the historian Supriya Gandhi, once said that she saw one

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.920
[Amit Varma]: of her tasks as making history complex again.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.440
[Amit Varma]: While the pursuit of history might be driven by the need to build narratives that explain

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.960
[Amit Varma]: the world, and those narratives are always simpler than the real world, it could be argued

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.560
[Amit Varma]: that the stories we have of the past today in India are just too damn simple.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.920
[Amit Varma]: Such as the one I mentioned a few moments ago about Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.600
[Amit Varma]: We like to think of them in the stark binaries I mentioned.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.880
[Amit Varma]: Dara as a tolerant and intellectually curious religious scholar, and Aurangzeb as a brutal

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.920
[Amit Varma]: bigot.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.360
[Amit Varma]: But these are caricatures, and both men were far more complex than these glib descriptions

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.680
[Amit Varma]: can capture.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.920
[Amit Varma]: Another false binary is the one between tolerant Sufism and rigid orthodox Islam.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.160
[Amit Varma]: Also a simplistic view that misses the complexities of Islam in India.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.960
[Amit Varma]: To better understand those complexities, I recommend you read The Emperor Who Never Was

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.080
[Amit Varma]: Dara Shikoh in Mughal India by Supriya Gandhi.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.800
[Amit Varma]: This is a marvellous human portrait of Dara Shikoh that gives a deep sense of what a complex

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.680
[Amit Varma]: man he was, and which also shows us the complex times he lived in.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.000
[Amit Varma]: There is a popular narrative today that talks about how India would be so different if Dara

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.160
[Amit Varma]: had been emperor instead of Aurangzeb.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.320
[Amit Varma]: Ashok Malik even called the murder of Dara Shikoh, quote, the partition before partition,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320
[Amit Varma]: stop quote.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.700
[Amit Varma]: Supriya's book gives me the sense that, well, maybe we are overthinking it.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.260
[Amit Varma]: Maybe it won't have been that different.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.080
[Amit Varma]: And certainly we would all still have been coping with lockdown.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.240
[Amit Varma]: Before we head on over to the conversation, though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.800
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to The Scene and The Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.080
[Amit Varma]: show alive.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.120
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and The Unseen has been a labour of love for me.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.720
[Amit Varma]: I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.720
[Amit Varma]: and hopefully yours as well.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.040
[Amit Varma]: But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off the show.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Although The Scene and The Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.040
[Amit Varma]: up to the insane engagement level of podcasts.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.440
[Amit Varma]: And I do many, many hours of deep research for each episode, besides all the logistics

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.560
[Amit Varma]: of producing the show myself, scheduling guests, booking studios, paying technicians, the travel

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.560
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.440
[Amit Varma]: So, well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.920
[Amit Varma]: And that involves you.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.120
[Amit Varma]: My proposition for you is this.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.980
[Amit Varma]: For every episode of The Scene and The Unseen that you enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.800
[Amit Varma]: even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.600
[Amit Varma]: You can do this by heading over to sceneunseen.in slash support and contributing an amount of

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.720
[Amit Varma]: your choice.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.680
[Amit Varma]: This is not a subscription.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.720
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and The Unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at sceneunseen.in.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.320
[Amit Varma]: This is just a gesture of appreciation.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.600
[Amit Varma]: Help keep this thing going.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.640
[Amit Varma]: sceneunseen.in slash support Supriya, welcome to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.640
[Guest]: Thank you.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Pleasure to be here.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.960
[Amit Varma]: Before we begin, you know, I'd like to know a little bit about your sort of intellectual

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.720
[Amit Varma]: and academic journey.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.840
[Amit Varma]: Like how did you get into the field that you are in?

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.500
[Amit Varma]: You majored in religious studies, you teach religious studies at Yale.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, what drew you to this field?

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.360
[Amit Varma]: And who was sort of your intellectual influences while you were growing as an intellectual?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.680
[Guest]: Religious studies is a field that is far more commonly encountered in the United States.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.240
[Guest]: And it's sometimes confused with theology or divinity studies.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.560
[Guest]: Religious studies is studying about religion.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.080
[Guest]: It isn't comparing religions to see what the best religion is.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.840
[Guest]: Neither is it training people to become priests or chaplains or whatever.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:31.320
[Guest]: And I actually haven't really studied religion very much formally.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:38.080
[Guest]: But my interest in this and my whole intellectual trajectory was shaped by growing up in India.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.600
[Guest]: I changed schools a number of times, I went to a boarding school.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.600
[Guest]: And then finally, when I turned 17, I landed in Delhi to go to college, I went to St. Stephen's

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.600
[Guest]: College.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.240
[Guest]: And for me, my educational experience wasn't just the college and the people I encountered

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.320
[Guest]: there and my teachers, of course, that they were also very important.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.160
[Guest]: It was exploring an Indian city as an adult, especially a city like Delhi with all the

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:14.680
[Guest]: layers of history and histories of people, migrations, etc., associated with it.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.160
[Guest]: So I would enjoy exploring Old Delhi.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:25.720
[Guest]: And one day I came across near Ajmeri Gate, the Ghazi-ud-Din Madrasa, which seemed to

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.760
[Guest]: be just a beautiful building.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.880
[Guest]: It was utterly quiet, full of the sound of birds.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.280
[Guest]: And I was there with a couple of friends and we just started wandering around.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.080
[Guest]: And then we were accosted by somebody.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.400
[Guest]: And I thought he was going to tell us off, that he was going to rebuke us and say, get

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.400
[Guest]: out of here.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.760
[Guest]: And instead, he said, he asked if we had come to see Dr. Joffrey.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.640
[Guest]: And at that point, I wasn't quite sure who he was.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.240
[Guest]: And then he introduced himself as Dr. Yunus Joffrey, the Persian professor, and no doubt

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.880
[Guest]: he was very used to having all kinds of people making a pilgrimage to see him.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.520
[Guest]: And it turned out he'd been profiled in William Dalrymple's book, City of Djinns.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.880
[Guest]: So Dr. Joffrey invited us to his little room, his little cell, and he served us delicious

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.640
[Guest]: chai and offered to teach us Persian.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:17.960
[Guest]: And I was the only one among our friends who took him up on the offer and I started learning

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.520
[Guest]: the alphabet.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.520
[Guest]: And I thought this would be a wonderful opportunity to read the poetry of Rumi, about whom I'd

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.520
[Guest]: heard, of course.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:34.400
[Guest]: So with Dr. Joffrey and my explanations of Delhi, I got my initial introduction into

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:42.040
[Guest]: a language and a history that was very, very much part of the education of most educated

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:48.520
[Guest]: people in North India at one point in time, but that had been excised from my own curriculum.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:55.920
[Guest]: So it was a fascinating complement to my studies of philosophy, which I pursued at St. Stephen's.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.400
[Guest]: And I had an equal interest in Indian philosophy, Sanskrit philosophy, the Sikh Darshanas, and

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.840
[Guest]: so on.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.400
[Guest]: And after this, after my studies, I was going to either spend a year in Benares doing Sanskrit

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.160
[Guest]: or spend a year in Iran doing Persian.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.360
[Guest]: And the year in Iran worked out, so I landed up there.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.200
[Guest]: I wanted to do something different.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:24.160
[Guest]: It's quite common for people from my college to, if they got good marks and so on, to want

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.520
[Guest]: to go to Oxford and Cambridge, and that idea didn't really attract me.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:35.080
[Guest]: I wanted to do something that didn't really have so much to do with an education in the

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.640
[Guest]: West, not immediately.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.600
[Guest]: So that year in Iran led to lots of other things.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.840
[Guest]: I was immersed in the study of Persian.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:51.640
[Guest]: I got to see a fascinating side of Iran that isn't really covered in the Western press.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:58.760
[Guest]: Studying in India is a huge advantage, just immense hospitality and warmth that I received

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.760
[Guest]: over there.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.080
[Guest]: And I got to see this amazing, very vibrant intellectual culture, some of it underground,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:11.040
[Guest]: some of it not so much, this long street of books in Taiwan that is probably one of the

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:17.640
[Guest]: longest streets for bookshops in the world, students discussing philosophy and ideas,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.760
[Guest]: an immense amount of intellectual curiosity.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:26.520
[Guest]: So what I wanted to do then was to take what I had learned in Iran of the Persian language,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:32.760
[Guest]: philosophy, Sufism, and so on, and apply that back to India, because then I discovered that

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.920
[Guest]: there were all these texts that were waiting to be read.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.320
[Guest]: I started hearing about Raghunath Shukla, although I didn't know that I was later going

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:47.480
[Guest]: to work on him, and all the Persian translations of Sanskrit works at Akbar's court and so

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.480
[Guest]: on.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.760
[Guest]: So I had the skill, and I might as well put it to use, but not just yet.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.920
[Guest]: So I continued my studies.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.640
[Guest]: I got a master's degree in London in Middle Eastern studies, and I started Arabic.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:09.040
[Guest]: I spent a year in Syria, I spent a year immersing myself in Arabic and the study of the Islamic

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.120
[Guest]: sciences through Arabic.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:18.000
[Guest]: And that was very, very different Syria to the war-torn, ravaged country that it is now

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
[Guest]: now.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.640
[Guest]: So that also was a wonderful experience.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.760
[Guest]: And then I realized that I had to pursue a PhD in the United States, where you have the

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:34.320
[Guest]: advantage of being able to fund your studies, you get paid to study and teach if you get

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.320
[Guest]: admission.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:41.440
[Guest]: So that's what I did, and so that's where I've ended up now.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:50.560
[Guest]: So my PhD was really in area studies, but I ended up working on topics that give me

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:56.400
[Guest]: a common vocabulary and common interests with those in the study of religion.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.840
[Amit Varma]: So that's where I've ended up right now.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.960
[Amit Varma]: So you know, it's fascinating that you often warned against looking at, you know, history

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.360
[Amit Varma]: in terms of simple narratives, but you know, while you were telling the story, it almost

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.440
[Amit Varma]: seemed as if it if it wasn't for that serendipitous meeting with Dr. Joffrey in the ruins and

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.840
[Amit Varma]: him offering to sort of teach you Persian, this whole journey may not have happened.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.840
[Amit Varma]: Is that kind of true?

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.880
[Amit Varma]: Or did you have a prior interest in all of these areas anyway, in terms of history and,

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.880
[Guest]: you know, languages and so on?

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.880
[Guest]: Thank you.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.680
[Guest]: Well, you know, it's a little hard to go back and do a counterfactual autobiography to see

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.840
[Guest]: what might have happened had I not met Dr. Joffrey.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:43.120
[Guest]: But I think my interest in exploring Old Delhi did stem from my curiosity about, about these

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.880
[Guest]: aspects that at least one part of my own school curriculum, and that were very much part of

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.640
[Guest]: my exploring the city around me.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.640
[Amit Varma]: So it might have happened.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.200
[Amit Varma]: And at that point, did you sort of have a specific vision of yourself in the future

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.120
[Amit Varma]: that I want to study history or write books of history or so on?

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.880
[Amit Varma]: Or were you just sort of going with your passions and going with your interests and letting

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.640
[Guest]: them lead you where they would?

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.680
[Guest]: I had no specific career plans.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:18.200
[Guest]: My boarding school was founded by J. Krishnamurti, it was in South India, and we were encouraged

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.640
[Guest]: to do things for the sake of it.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.320
[Guest]: It wasn't like kind of typical Indian school with rankings and like people having people

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.600
[Guest]: really eager to do competitive exams.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.160
[Guest]: Of course, one's very lucky and privileged to be to be free of that.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:40.520
[Guest]: But no, I was I was not thinking instrumentally in any way I was following my interests.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.280
[Amit Varma]: And you know, it sort of strikes me that, you know, did studying Persian and did for

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:50.720
[Amit Varma]: example, spending time in Iran and Syria and all of that, give you a window into aspects

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.440
[Amit Varma]: of India and Indian culture, which are otherwise invisible to us, for example, we know that

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.280
[Amit Varma]: there is a lot of Persian influence in our language, in our culture, in our cooking and

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.160
[Amit Varma]: all of that, except that is, you know, we've internalized it and we don't think of ourselves

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160
[Amit Varma]: in that way.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.320
[Amit Varma]: Many of us don't think of ourselves as the sort of melting pot that we are where all

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.140
[Amit Varma]: these influences exist.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.760
[Amit Varma]: So did you feel that your understanding of India itself, our culture, our language, all

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:21.720
[Amit Varma]: of that deepened because you were going deeper into say, the influences of Persian as a language

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:27.040
[Amit Varma]: and then maybe influences from Iran as a culture because those exist as well?

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.560
[Amit Varma]: Did that make you sort of see the unseen, in a sense, which many of us would otherwise

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.560
[Guest]: miss out on?

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.560
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.560
[Guest]: I think definitely.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:40.200
[Guest]: So and you know, I consider myself very much still a student of India and Indian history,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.280
[Guest]: you know, I find it endlessly fascinating.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:48.800
[Guest]: Yes, my studies of Persian, for instance, helped me see all the Persian words that existed

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:57.880
[Guest]: in Hindustani and Indian languages, the influences, whether it's cuisine, poetry, language, and

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.880
[Guest]: so on.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.880
[Guest]: You know, had I grown up in Lucknow, for instance, you know, I might have been more steeped in

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.000
[Guest]: that, but I spent a lot of my life in South India and in, you know, in fairly, you know,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
[Guest]: insulated environments.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.160
[Guest]: So absolutely, I got a completely different perspective on India, through my studies in

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.600
[Amit Varma]: Iran and in Syria.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.800
[Amit Varma]: And is it sort of, you know, when you start studying history, given that, especially when

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.200
[Amit Varma]: you study the Mughals, right, there are such set narratives about the Mughals that are

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.480
[Amit Varma]: already there.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.600
[Amit Varma]: And when you, you know, start studying a period in history, how difficult is it to put the

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.480
[Amit Varma]: hindsight bias away?

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.720
[Amit Varma]: Because there's no mystery, right?

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:39.080
[Amit Varma]: We already know everything that has happened in terms of the events that have taken place.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.200
[Amit Varma]: And for those specific times, there are very few sources, often those sources will tend

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.560
[Amit Varma]: to be biased sources, like the winners will write their own history, and Aurangzeb obviously

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.360
[Amit Varma]: will want to, you know, paint Dara Shikoh in whatever way is convenient to him.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:57.640
[Amit Varma]: So how difficult is it to then be able to say that, you know, regardless of what period

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.480
[Amit Varma]: of history you're studying, how difficult is it to sort of strip all of that away the

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:06.880
[Amit Varma]: things that you know, the narratives that are almost reflexive to us, and be able to

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.440
[Amit Varma]: sort of figure out things in a contemporary way, like one of the things that struck me

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.080
[Amit Varma]: while reading your book, which was so different from everything that we've sort of learned

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.800
[Amit Varma]: about Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb, apart from obviously the false binaries, which we'll

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.920
[Amit Varma]: discuss later.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.200
[Amit Varma]: But one of the things that kind of struck me was that sense throughout the book that

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.920
[Amit Varma]: Dara Shikoh is really in training to be an emperor, it's it's almost it seems foredeigned

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.080
[Amit Varma]: and he is behaving as if he is going to be the emperor, he's almost co ruling with his

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.760
[Amit Varma]: father in a sense.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.480
[Amit Varma]: And then one day it all falls apart and Aurangzeb is a, you know, a bit player in all of this

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.520
[Amit Varma]: going off to the deck and going off there going off here.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.920
[Amit Varma]: And you know, when we typically look at history, we think of what we're taught in our textbooks,

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.400
[Amit Varma]: these are the great emperors, you know, after Shah Jahan, there's Aurangzeb and it's a very

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.400
[Amit Varma]: different look.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400
[Amit Varma]: So how do you do that?

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.660
[Amit Varma]: Is that something you have to consciously tell yourself that look, I have to avoid these

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:03.360
[Amit Varma]: dominant narratives, I have to, you know, look at each period and each event as if I

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.560
[Amit Varma]: don't know what is happening next?

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.640
[Guest]: Is that a discipline you have to build?

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.560
[Guest]: That's an interesting question.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:16.280
[Guest]: And actually, to an extent, that is sort of the methodology that I've followed in this

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.280
[Guest]: book.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.920
[Guest]: Initially, I was, I was reluctant to choose Dara Shikoh, partly because he's so well known.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.400
[Guest]: He's not as well known as Aurangzeb.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:30.680
[Guest]: But the story of Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb is sort of like a foundational origin story

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.960
[Guest]: of the subcontinent explaining how we got where we are today.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.200
[Guest]: So I was a bit hesitant about doing that.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.880
[Guest]: Because there's also a lot of merit in looking at the histories of people who don't have

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:43.880
[Guest]: written histories.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:49.880
[Guest]: There are many, many ways in which one can look at this, this early modern period, addressing

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.640
[Guest]: themes and processes and so on.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:59.960
[Guest]: And in the end, I found that I couldn't really leave Dara, partly because he's such a prominent

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.960
[Guest]: figure today.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:07.560
[Guest]: You know, I say in my introduction, that these Mughal royals, most of them emperors, but

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.720
[Guest]: some others also still live among us.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.440
[Guest]: We feel we know them, we feel that they're just so familiar, you just need to call someone

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.000
[Guest]: Aurangzeb, you know, in India, and you know that it's a slur, you know, it's something

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.480
[Guest]: like, you know, you're saying something really nasty about them, they're treacherous, they're

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.960
[Guest]: not loyal to their families, and so on.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:34.080
[Guest]: But having looked at Mughal primary sources, I knew that the story was much more complicated

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.080
[Guest]: than that.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:43.800
[Guest]: So I think if one dips one's feet in the water of the Persian sources of the time, sources

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:50.040
[Guest]: in other languages, you do get the sense that things are very different.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:56.360
[Guest]: And then there's another kind of principle, a methodological principle of writing history

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:03.240
[Guest]: that are used, which was to try to look at the sources that were contemporaneous with

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.680
[Guest]: Dara, or that if one looks at later sources to make sure that you know that, to make sure

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.440
[Guest]: that you're sort of disclosing that these are later sources, these are written by people

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.880
[Guest]: who are not eyewitnesses, who are not contemporaries.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.960
[Guest]: And you know, they might have another axe to grind, they might have, there's definitely

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:28.200
[Guest]: covered by either being written in Aurangzeb's time, or later with the benefit of hindsight.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:33.240
[Guest]: So that it definitely tells you a lot about the period in which those sources were written.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.720
[Guest]: But we want to know how Dara was representing himself, again, you know, once being quite

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.880
[Guest]: careful about avoiding any, just any kernel of core historical truth, because what you

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.800
[Guest]: have is just a new way of representations.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.480
[Guest]: And if we look at the representations from that period, what are they saying?

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.320
[Guest]: What are they telling us?

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.720
[Guest]: So that's the question that I kept in mind when I was doing my research.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.200
[Amit Varma]: And what drew you to the project to begin with?

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.140
[Amit Varma]: Like you said, it's a very resonant story, the Dara versus Aurangzeb, it's almost a foundational

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.160
[Amit Varma]: story of Islam in the subcontinent in many senses.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.960
[Amit Varma]: So were you sort of drawn into exploring that further?

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.040
[Amit Varma]: Or during your readings, did you find that, wait a minute, this guy is much more complicated

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.120
[Amit Varma]: than all of this, and I need to dig into this deeper, like, which came first, you're choosing

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.040
[Amit Varma]: the story or the story choosing you as it were?

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:30.120
[Guest]: So I think what came first was what I did during my doctoral studies, my PhD studies

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:36.920
[Guest]: at Harvard, I wanted to study some aspect of the Sanskrit Persian encounter.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.160
[Guest]: And I found that I couldn't really avoid Dara Shukoh.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.920
[Guest]: He is such a central figure after Akbar.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:48.600
[Guest]: I mean, he is a Mughal royal who's producing his own translations, with help of course

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.880
[Guest]: and collaboration.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.960
[Guest]: And that I found that people were reading his writings later on.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:01.040
[Guest]: So he had this really long, diachronic influence.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.640
[Guest]: And he was such a key figure.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:08.880
[Guest]: So I started just looking at the works that he wrote, you know, I did a fresh translation

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.200
[Guest]: of the Majnul Bahrain that I'm sitting on, I haven't published that yet.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.920
[Guest]: And I looked at his Surya Akbar and so on.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.480
[Guest]: And then later on, when I wanted to write a book, I realized that I have to place this

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.880
[Guest]: in its social and political context.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:28.440
[Guest]: So the book is, you know, it's quite, quite different from what I did during my, my PhD.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:33.360
[Guest]: But my initial attraction was just to look at Dara Shukoh, you know, he was, he's just

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:39.640
[Guest]: this amazingly prolific figure, and to sort of to see, to look at his intellectual trajectory

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.560
[Guest]: to see, you know, how he was developing his thought and his ideas.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, in a recent interview, which of course I linked from the show notes, you said

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.200
[Amit Varma]: something I found very interesting, which is that the narrative task of a historian

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:57.080
[Amit Varma]: is to make history complex again, which of course speaks to how in trying to make sense

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.320
[Amit Varma]: of the world, we necessarily have to come up with simple narratives for everything.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.720
[Amit Varma]: And very often, when we look at history, these simple narratives are convenient, simple narratives

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:10.960
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that they bolster whatever our vision of the world is, in fact, you quoted

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.360
[Amit Varma]: Baths in your book, and you said that, you know, you invoked his saying history evaporates.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.400
[Amit Varma]: And you said that, in your words, quote, myth also clads ideological structures in a narrative

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.600
[Amit Varma]: form, stop quote, and obviously, there are very deeper entrenched narratives that are

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.600
[Amit Varma]: at play here.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:32.080
[Amit Varma]: And now when you get into it, it's almost as if and you also chose a narrative form,

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:38.160
[Amit Varma]: which I suppose, in some senses was meant to reach out to a broader than academic readership.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:43.360
[Amit Varma]: So obviously, you want to also tell a compelling story, which you think is, you know, different

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.400
[Amit Varma]: from the simple narratives which previously exist.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:53.480
[Amit Varma]: But where do you maintain that balance of sort of being complex and being coherent?

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:58.440
[Amit Varma]: Was that a challenge? And was it also a challenge that there is so little material to play with

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.320
[Amit Varma]: that you're being forced to make choices?

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.240
[Amit Varma]: And are those choices something that you're then examining why you're making those choices?

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.200
[Guest]: Yes, of course, you know, there are a lot of choices involved in one's telling of the

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.520
[Guest]: story, for instance, you know, so this is so this book, it is a narrative.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:20.800
[Guest]: It's a retelling of the simple myth of Tara Shukla and Aurangzeb and as you know, as you

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:26.200
[Guest]: mentioned, I'm calling this a myth, not because I'm saying it's not true, but because these

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.800
[Guest]: are stories that live with us, they live with us, there are ciphers and sort of short forms

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:36.480
[Guest]: for a whole range of ideas and ideological positions.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.640
[Guest]: So when I'm turning this into a story, I am making choices about what to include what

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.520
[Guest]: to say.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.920
[Guest]: And I think that's something that happens no matter what kind of book you write.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.040
[Guest]: One could write a more conventional academic sort of book, the kind of book that has an

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.880
[Guest]: introduction with a chapter outline, and a conclusion sort of summing up these things

00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.120
[Guest]: and and, you know, perhaps some thematic chapters, and you're still making choices, you're making

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:06.160
[Guest]: choices about, about what to include what fits in with your argument, what doesn't necessarily

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.880
[Guest]: address your argument, what isn't so useful to you.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:18.280
[Guest]: And in this case, I chose to present my argument in the form of a narrative, so doing more

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:23.920
[Guest]: showing than telling, though, of course, there is definitely some telling that goes on.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:29.560
[Guest]: But what this book isn't, it isn't a grab bag of every single fact in the world about

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.560
[Guest]: Tara Shukla and Aurangzeb.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.840
[Guest]: And that's partly because, you know, no publisher would really want to publish something like

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.840
[Guest]: that.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.960
[Guest]: There are word limits, there are, you know, all kinds of things that have to be negotiated.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:46.080
[Guest]: So if you want to book, you know, something between two covers that can reach a fairly

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.800
[Guest]: wide audience, there are there are always choices that one needs.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And what were your sort of models in terms of books which attempted a similar thing a

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.280
[Amit Varma]: show don't tell approach with a distant period of history, you know, a very serious book

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.400
[Amit Varma]: written with a lot of rigor, but told in a narrative style that can, you know, appeal

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.480
[Amit Varma]: to larger audiences.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:11.840
[Amit Varma]: So who were the sort of writers of history who you admired and learned from?

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.880
[Guest]: So that's a great question.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:21.880
[Guest]: And I didn't have a whole lot of models from this period of South Asian history.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.840
[Guest]: You know, loads of historians whom I admire, of course.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.480
[Guest]: But when I was writing this, you know, I didn't have a precise model.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.160
[Guest]: It's not as though this is a genre.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.720
[Guest]: It so happened that as I was writing the book, and as it was in production, there was a whole

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:48.360
[Guest]: slew of of mobile biographies that that came out, some by academic colleagues, one or two,

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:53.400
[Guest]: and a lot of them by other writers in South Asia, which I think is a is a wonderful trend.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.600
[Guest]: There wasn't a whole lot, you know, I can just think of the top of my head of, you know,

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.280
[Guest]: some, some writers whom I read, you know, there is the American historian Jim Lepore,

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:07.080
[Guest]: who writes very prolific essays for the New Yorker and also other books.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:16.760
[Guest]: And, again, she has this amazing gift for narrative history and kind of lucid prose.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:23.440
[Guest]: So she's, she's one author whom I have been reading, you know, and I've also been really

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:30.800
[Guest]: impressed by Shamsur Rehman Farooqui's sort of luxuriant novels that really bring to life

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.480
[Guest]: the times that they talk about, and there are all these intricate narrative threads

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.280
[Guest]: and characters woven in.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.560
[Guest]: So that, you know, was another sort of indirect influence.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:50.400
[Guest]: You know, I was drawing inspiration from novelists as much as from historians, except that, you

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.880
[Guest]: know, I was trying to piece together this narrative after being really steeped in the

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.440
[Guest]: primary sources of the era.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:01.440
[Guest]: So I had to construct something that I hoped would read a bit like a novel, except that

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.360
[Guest]: it was all nonfiction.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:10.240
[Amit Varma]: In the introduction to your book, you sort of pointed out about how you were at first

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:15.240
[Amit Varma]: hesitant about writing it, because you didn't want to, you know, privilege this whole great

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:21.720
[Amit Varma]: men sort of way of history, and so much of the narrative around Dara is actually a great

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.600
[Amit Varma]: man narrative that had he been emperor instead of Aurangzeb, the entire subcontinent would

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.000
[Amit Varma]: have proceeded in a different direction.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.480
[Amit Varma]: And this is something I kind of like to ask the historians who come on the show that,

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, where do you stand in the great man theory of history?

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I'd be interested in having you elaborate on that.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
[Guest]: Yes.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.880
[Guest]: So the thing about, you know, great men is that we tend to really love them in the present

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.520
[Guest]: moment.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.600
[Guest]: That's how we tend to look at history.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:51.880
[Guest]: So in the popular imagination in South Asia, history is this succession of either great

00:26:51.880 --> 00:27:01.480
[Guest]: men or depraved men who, you know, had tremendous control over steering its course and so on.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:07.320
[Guest]: So if you write about someone, it must mean that you sort of, you know, like greatly admire

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.320
[Guest]: them.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:13.000
[Guest]: And, you know, I do, I do have empathy for Dara Shukla, I feel that, you know, I've tried

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.280
[Guest]: to understand things from his perspective and there are lots of things I like about

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:21.720
[Guest]: him, but I would be very hesitant to elevate him or any Mughal emperor for that matter

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.640
[Guest]: to this great man status.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.240
[Guest]: So I'll just talk about my hesitancy for a bit, and then I'll go back to why I still

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.640
[Guest]: think it's important to study these figures.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:41.080
[Guest]: I'm hesitant because the Mughal Empire was about a whole lot more than just the emperor

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.080
[Guest]: and the court.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.600
[Guest]: It was a fairly loose-knit empire.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:56.560
[Guest]: It was held together by a whole array of nobility, chieftains, and so on, who were really masters

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:01.720
[Guest]: of their own domains.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:07.680
[Guest]: The emperor was still important as a figurehead and as an idea.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:15.040
[Guest]: Dara Shukla, you know, lived during the period where the idea of the sacred sovereign was

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:24.280
[Guest]: really at its height, so yes, you know, the idea of this all-powerful emperor who is responsible

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:31.600
[Guest]: for keeping the whole, the empire in a state of harmony and balance was very important.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:38.760
[Guest]: And yet our obsession with great men can obscure us to broader facts of cultural process that

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:45.080
[Guest]: exist quite separately, quite independent of the actions of emperors.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:50.800
[Guest]: There are a whole range of environmental changes, for instance, that are taking place that also

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:57.840
[Guest]: have an impact on where people live, what religion they might choose, and so on.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:03.280
[Guest]: Richard Eaton's work on Bengal is a case in point.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.000
[Guest]: So there are a whole range of other factors that are far more important than men.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.480
[Guest]: And of course, you know, there is the gender dimension that our focus on men has obscured

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.960
[Guest]: the important role of women and others in history.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:21.520
[Guest]: But still, it's hard to get away from these figures because I think it's important to

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:26.040
[Guest]: study them in their complexity as well.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.040
[Guest]: And for Dara Shukoh, his influence ranges far beyond his time.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:36.520
[Guest]: In fact, my current work, which we can speak about in a bit, partly addresses how people

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:46.280
[Guest]: were reading Dara Shukoh much after his death and how his own studies of Indic thought spawned

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:54.080
[Guest]: all kinds of other intellectual debates, changes, and dialogues that he couldn't even have predicted.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:59.880
[Guest]: So if you're looking at the section of elite society in pre-modern and even in colonial

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.720
[Guest]: India, the small section that was literate, or a larger section that was kind of literate

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.960
[Guest]: aware, figures like Dara Shukoh do tend to have an important reach.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.640
[Guest]: And they also remind us that what happened at the court wasn't something that was just

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.440
[Guest]: purely located in that context, that what happened at the court was informed by other

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.240
[Guest]: intellectual conversations, dialogues, cultural processes that were taking place outside the

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.240
[Guest]: court.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:31.880
[Guest]: So Dara Shukoh wasn't alone, it wasn't just that he invented inter-religious dialogue.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:37.480
[Guest]: He was participating in something that took place in many other venues as well.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.560
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, one of the things that I have got a sense of in the past few months by reading

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:46.040
[Amit Varma]: books like yours and Ira Mukherjee's book, and she was also on the show a while back,

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:51.760
[Amit Varma]: and Mani Mukta Sharma and so on, is that, you know, we think of these as almost caricature

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:57.040
[Amit Varma]: figures that Aurangzeb is this evil bigoted guy and Dara Shukoh is this tolerant secular

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040
[Amit Varma]: guy.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.920
[Amit Varma]: But actually, you know, the emperor wasn't the be-all and end-all of the empire, there

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:07.240
[Amit Varma]: was a deep state, there was a political economy in which the women of the harems were deeply

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.240
[Amit Varma]: involved.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.840
[Amit Varma]: And also, as we'll discuss shortly, these binaries also don't hold true in the sense

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:17.440
[Amit Varma]: that Aurangzeb was also to an extent steeped in culture and engaging with the world and

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.640
[Amit Varma]: if Dara Shukoh had come to power, he would probably have beheaded his brothers as well.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:26.800
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, it's not that things would have necessarily been as different as we try to

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.800
[Amit Varma]: make it.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:33.100
[Amit Varma]: I mean, my friend Ashok Malik once wrote a piece where he called, you know, the execution

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.400
[Amit Varma]: of Dara Shukoh, the partition before partition, which you've sort of cited in your book, and

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:42.840
[Amit Varma]: I was, you know, which is almost emblematic of these definitive, simplistic takes that

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.840
[Amit Varma]: one draw of these.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.120
[Amit Varma]: And I was also, you know, struck by, and I'll quote this bit from your book, because it

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.800
[Amit Varma]: overall seems to sum up how the binaries play out where you talk about the trial of Dara

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.080
[Amit Varma]: Shukoh and you write, quote, the trial is a powerful motif because it transforms a story

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.960
[Amit Varma]: about 17th century India into a narrative about today.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.760
[Amit Varma]: It creates a dialectic between two opposing visions of Islam.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.520
[Amit Varma]: Islam is zealous extremism immediately familiar in our present context.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.560
[Amit Varma]: And it's counterpoint Islam as Sufi antinomianism.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:15.040
[Amit Varma]: But even without the supposed trial, the brothers clash is a story that addresses the deepest

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.120
[Amit Varma]: questions of who we are and how we got here.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.120
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.280
[Amit Varma]: And you also relate in your book about how through history we look at these two very

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:28.080
[Amit Varma]: divergent views of say Aurangzeb and Dara Shukoh where Muhammad Iqbal and Rumuzi Bekhudi

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:34.040
[Amit Varma]: praises Aurangzeb as, you know, that ascetic, that sword master and all of that.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.160
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, Ashok Malik calls it the partition before partition.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.280
[Amit Varma]: But equally on the other side, you have, you know, the two 20th century bios of Dara that

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.520
[Amit Varma]: you've referred to by Kalik Ranjan Kanungo and Vikramjeet Hasrat, where both of them

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.760
[Amit Varma]: praise him.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:51.440
[Amit Varma]: And Kanungo says the world has not become richer in any way by the long reign of Aurangzeb,

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.920
[Amit Varma]: but it would certainly have been poorer without Dara Shukoh.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:55.920
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.640
[Amit Varma]: And one, of course, we'll talk about how these binaries aren't true.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.120
[Amit Varma]: But the question that struck me while I was reading these is that at some point in our

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.440
[Amit Varma]: history, what is happening, and I think it happened repeatedly over the late 19th century

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:13.780
[Amit Varma]: and the early 20th century, is that these conflicting ideas of Islam are competing with

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.140
[Amit Varma]: the conflicting ideas of India.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:21.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, as in, where does a lot of the debates that were playing out, you know, where does

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.780
[Amit Varma]: the good Muslim stand with relation to his fealty towards India?

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:31.360
[Amit Varma]: This was part of the reason why, for example, you know, Mahatma Gandhi's alliance with the

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:36.480
[Amit Varma]: Ali brothers at the time of the Khilafat movement seems so discordant, because, you know, while

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:41.240
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi is fighting for a vision of India as a nation state, per se, the Ali brothers are

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:47.200
[Amit Varma]: fighting for a larger Ummah where your allegiance is to somewhere else entirely.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:52.760
[Amit Varma]: So what are sort of your thoughts also on how these competing ideas of Islam have played

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.400
[Amit Varma]: out against the competing ideas of India?

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I realize this is a sort of a larger question than, you know, what your book is

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.160
[Amit Varma]: about.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:05.640
[Amit Varma]: But because that's, of course, set in those Mughal times, but I'd love to know what thoughts

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.640
[Guest]: you've had on these.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.640
[Guest]: Sure.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.640
[Guest]: So thank you.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:12.680
[Guest]: So, you know, of course, the Khilafat movement is very, very modern.

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:18.560
[Guest]: It comes at a time when ideas of Islam are changing.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:24.880
[Guest]: And there is this kind of political Islam that is forming in opposition to colonialism.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:31.520
[Guest]: You know, there is a Muslim public sphere, there's a Hindu public sphere.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:39.840
[Guest]: So colonialism played an important role in transforming how these communities drew boundaries

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.080
[Guest]: around their identities, how they saw each other, how they saw their role.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:50.920
[Guest]: In the case of Dara Shukoh, yes, it's depending on which side of the border you're on or what

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:58.160
[Guest]: ideology you gravitate towards, you know, Dara Shukoh is either this terrible heretic,

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.400
[Guest]: you know, it was like just as well that Aurangzeb got him out of the way.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:08.520
[Guest]: You see this in a lot of narratives from Pakistan, not all, but at all, you know, not kind of

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:18.200
[Guest]: more state-sponsored narratives, or Dara Shukoh is this wonderful philosopher and gentle mystic

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.200
[Guest]: who really ought to have been ruler.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.400
[Guest]: But there's always a caveat, there's always a little bit of doubt with that, because even

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.720
[Guest]: those, like his wonderful earlier 20th century biographers, Phanungo and Hester, even those

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:36.080
[Guest]: who praise him, they still feel, well, you know, he was, yes, he had these amazing views

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:42.800
[Guest]: and was interested in Sanskrit and Indic thought, but there was actually no way he could really

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.120
[Guest]: practically rule.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:50.520
[Guest]: He was too weak, he was uninterested in the throne, and you really needed someone more

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.720
[Guest]: ruthless like Aurangzeb.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:58.800
[Guest]: So it was inevitable that somebody who was more crafty, who was more capable of being

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.160
[Amit Varma]: the emperor.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:05.200
[Amit Varma]: And this, as you've pointed out, is not the truth, obviously, I mean, that whole binary

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.440
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, Dara had his head in the clouds, and he was just doing all these religious

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.160
[Amit Varma]: studies and meeting Sufi saints, and Aurangzeb was the guy who was going out and, you know,

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.480
[Amit Varma]: conquering territories and all that isn't true at all.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:22.280
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, Dara was Shah Jahan's chosen successor, in a sense, and they almost co-ruled

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.560
[Amit Varma]: for many, many years.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.000
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, when people asked that hypothetical question of what would Dara have been as a

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.840
[Amit Varma]: ruler, what you've pointed out is that we already kind of know.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.840
[Guest]: Yes, absolutely.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:38.280
[Guest]: So, you know, one thing that I've tried to do is to disturb the idea that that's a very

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:44.400
[Guest]: modern idea, that a ruler should not be interested in philosophy, that a ruler should, you know,

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:51.200
[Guest]: is not really the kind of person to have dialogues with ascetics, that belongs to a totally different

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:57.840
[Guest]: realm of life, and it's not part of an emperor or would-be emperor's political relations.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.840
[Guest]: And I've tried to show how Dara wasn't an outlier in this regard, he was actually following

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.400
[Guest]: an established Mughal tradition.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:08.480
[Guest]: He was, without acknowledging them, following in the footsteps of his great-grandfather

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:16.400
[Guest]: Akbar and, to an extent as well, his own grandfather Jahangir, that he complemented his own father

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:21.960
[Guest]: Shah Jahan, who was often viewed as somebody who was more orthodox, he was paving the way

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:28.080
[Guest]: for Aurangzeb's far, you know, stricter, more ascetic orthodox rule.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:34.480
[Guest]: But Dara and Shah Jahan together were hosting Sanskrit pundits at the court who composed

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:41.280
[Guest]: poems in praise of them, you know, he was hosting all these intellectual and spiritual

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:45.840
[Guest]: dialogues and was very, very much part of what he was doing as a ruler, he certainly

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.400
[Guest]: saw himself as one.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:53.040
[Guest]: Now Aurangzeb did have an advantage, Aurangzeb had the advantage of gaining a lot of military

00:37:53.040 --> 00:38:01.800
[Guest]: experience on his own, often in the face of, you know, either opposition and really irritating

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.880
[Guest]: micromanaging on the part of Shah Jahan.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:12.600
[Guest]: He was able to govern the Deccan as well on his own, so he got a lot of independent experience

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:17.440
[Guest]: that served him well in the struggle for the throne later on.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:23.200
[Guest]: But it doesn't mean that, you know, Dara Shukrawal didn't prove himself as a future

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.200
[Amit Varma]: emperor.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:28.840
[Amit Varma]: No, I was, in fact, you mentioned micromanaging and there are these very funny bits in your

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:33.120
[Amit Varma]: book, which are again, perfect examples of show don't tell and I love the bit about the

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.640
[Amit Varma]: mangoes where, you know, Aurangzeb I think is in Aurangabad and he's got to send and

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.440
[Amit Varma]: his dad is waiting for mangoes because it's Aurangzeb's duty to send him the mangoes as

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.600
[Amit Varma]: soon as the first good ones come.

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.480
[Amit Varma]: So Shah Jahan writes him a letter and says, have people stand below the tree, I can't

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.360
[Amit Varma]: wait as soon as they come, they got to catch them as they fall.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:55.000
[Amit Varma]: Aurangzeb sends him mangoes and Shah Jahan replies that these are shitty mangoes and

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.600
[Amit Varma]: have you eaten my good mangoes and Aurangzeb has to reply that no, your highness, I would

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.000
[Amit Varma]: not dare to eat.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.160
[Amit Varma]: And of course, there's a more consequential version of this during the Kandahar battle

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:11.040
[Amit Varma]: where you point out about how they are laying siege to Kandahar, which the Safaites have

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:16.200
[Amit Varma]: taken over and Aurangzeb who is on the ground who can see the conditions realizes that the

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:20.440
[Amit Varma]: artillery is useless and he's in line with the suggestion that let's just attack from

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.560
[Amit Varma]: one point and focus there.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:27.220
[Amit Varma]: And he tells his dad and Papa Shah Jahan, you know, doing central planning from hundreds

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.720
[Amit Varma]: of miles away says no, no, we, you know, use those cannons and we'll, you know, attack

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:36.300
[Amit Varma]: from two places and he seems like such an, you know, must be such an irritating dad to

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:40.000
[Amit Varma]: have to deal with for Aurangzeb, you know.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.720
[Amit Varma]: And since we're talking about sort of Shah Jahan, I found a really interesting character

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.280
[Amit Varma]: because there are just so many sides to his persona that you can really paint him as anything

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:55.320
[Amit Varma]: like you've pointed out, you know, his journey to the throne, of course, is incredibly bloody

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.800
[Amit Varma]: where he has to get rid of all his brothers and nephews and all of that.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.040
[Amit Varma]: At the same time, you have the softer, more sensuous side of him, partly reflected, of

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.880
[Amit Varma]: course, in his deep love for his wife and, you know, the good deeds that he does.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:13.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, you point out an example of what, you know, today, I'm sure many people would jump

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:20.480
[Amit Varma]: on where in 1633, he decides to get a bunch of temples raised, including 66 under construction

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.320
[Amit Varma]: temples in Banaras.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.680
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, later in the story, when Dara Shikoh is, you know, involving himself

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.920
[Amit Varma]: with Indic philosophy, calling all these scholars to the court, it is Shah Jahan who is, as

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.640
[Amit Varma]: you point out, giving them generous gifts and all of that.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:40.480
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, all these figures are so deeply complex and Shah Jahan himself is so complex.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.840
[Amit Varma]: This is a dude who, you know, did away with his whole damn family.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.720
[Amit Varma]: And yet you see this side of him as well.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:52.200
[Amit Varma]: And in the end, you almost feel sorry for him because he's sort of imprisoned by Aurangzeb.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:57.440
[Amit Varma]: And one story that you pointed out is that, you know, after Dara Shikoh is killed, his

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:01.360
[Amit Varma]: head is sent to Aurangzeb and there is, you know, so and this is another thing, there

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.800
[Amit Varma]: are so many versions of that story.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.440
[Amit Varma]: One version of the head story is that Dara Shikoh is beheaded and the head is brought

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.640
[Amit Varma]: to Aurangzeb and he says, I don't want to look at it.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:13.440
[Amit Varma]: And the other version is that he stabs her three times, you know, and sends it to his

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.080
[Amit Varma]: dad.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:20.000
[Amit Varma]: So when you're reading all this delightfully juicy stuff, you know, and you have no way

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.680
[Amit Varma]: of knowing which one is true, right?

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.400
[Amit Varma]: So how do you navigate that?

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:29.280
[Guest]: So with the head story, some of it, you can see if it falls into recognizable motifs and

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.160
[Guest]: tropes that are used elsewhere.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:39.880
[Guest]: So you know, it's one of the head stories we told by the Italian adventurer Manucci.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:46.220
[Guest]: You see that what he's doing here is really making Dara Shikoh into a Christ-like figure.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:52.680
[Guest]: So whether or not the story is true, the way in which Manucci is recounting it serves a

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:58.720
[Guest]: certain narrative end and definitely elicits horror and sympathy.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:05.880
[Guest]: And these are for things that the European travelers to India wanted to elicit in their

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.880
[Guest]: readers.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.480
[Guest]: They spun all kinds of stories and we can't dismiss them completely, but their accounts

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:20.960
[Guest]: are colored by the fact that they were transforming their adventures in India into entertainment

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.560
[Guest]: for the consumption of the European reading public.

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:32.120
[Guest]: So they were fitting them into morals that were also familiar to their readers in the

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.120
[Amit Varma]: world.

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.120
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.120
[Amit Varma]: And let's take a quick commercial break.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:40.120
[Amit Varma]: And after we are done with that, we'll come back from Shah Jahan and zoom into his two

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.120
[Amit Varma]: errant children.

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:46.160
[Amit Varma]: Hi, I'm Vivek Kaul.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.160
[Amit Varma]: And I'm Amit Verma.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.520
[Amit Varma]: Here to tell you about a new weekly podcast that Vivek and I have launched called Econ

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.520
[Unknown]: Central.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:58.720
[Unknown]: In Econ Central, we will help you make sense of the economic news of the last week.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.120
[Unknown]: And we'll also try to explain complex subjects in a simple language.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:07.560
[Amit Varma]: We will also take events outside the world of economics, like from politics, sports,

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.960
[Amit Varma]: literature, and explain them through the lens of economic thinking.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.640
[Unknown]: Why is the stock market going up when the economy is going down?

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.960
[Unknown]: What's the deal with high petrol prices?

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.920
[Amit Varma]: Should we boycott Chinese goods?

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.700
[Amit Varma]: What does free speech have to do with incentives?

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:26.520
[Amit Varma]: Why are the roving bandits of Uttar Pradesh in competition with the biggest protection

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.080
[Unknown]: racket out there, the Indian state?

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.080
[Unknown]: All this and more in our new weekly podcast, Econ Central.

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:37.480
[Amit Varma]: Econ Central launched a few weeks ago and is free on all podcast apps.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:42.440
[Amit Varma]: You can browse our archives at econcentral.in.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:46.200
[Unknown]: Econ Central, you have an incentive to listen.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:54.680
[Amit Varma]: Don't forget the URL, econcentral.in.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.920
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen.

00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:00.720
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Supriya Gandhi about Dara Shukoh, Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb, all of that.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:08.080
[Amit Varma]: So you know what I sort of found very interesting about your story also is that how your narratives

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:13.680
[Amit Varma]: by placing us in that contemporary moment makes us for a moment, you know, forget what

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.680
[Amit Varma]: happened later.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:19.400
[Amit Varma]: I actually, you know, at different points, you find yourself rooting for guys you eventually

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.040
[Amit Varma]: know got beheaded.

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:26.000
[Amit Varma]: And I thought it a very interesting choice to sort of start with the story of Khurram

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.600
[Amit Varma]: there because like you pointed out when Dara Shukoh is born, Dara Shukoh is basically,

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, the first son of the third son.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:37.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, he's really, you know, there's nothing much happening there and Aurangzeb is even

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.760
[Amit Varma]: further down the feeder chain and nothing is ordained.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:46.200
[Amit Varma]: And for large periods of time, Khurram is not even his father's choice till eventually

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.360
[Amit Varma]: he ascends and he becomes Shah Jahan.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.720
[Amit Varma]: And you know, Dara Shukoh is sort of regarded, you know, we have the simplistic view that

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:59.280
[Amit Varma]: okay, he's a person who was into spiritual matters and really got into a sort of Hinduism

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.560
[Amit Varma]: and the Indic religions and all of that.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:07.640
[Amit Varma]: But the sense that I got from reading your book is that this stuff happened in stages.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:12.360
[Amit Varma]: And what seemed to me to be the case, and you can correct me, but my feeling was through

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:18.520
[Amit Varma]: the book that before his intellectual journey really took off, like the sense that I got

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:23.840
[Amit Varma]: initially, although this changes is that it was more of a spiritual journey than an intellectual

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:24.840
[Amit Varma]: journey.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:31.520
[Amit Varma]: For example, you know, the way that he meets Mian Mir, for example, and almost instinctively,

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, sort of prostrates himself before him and offers himself as a disciple.

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:41.520
[Amit Varma]: And it just seems sort of very impulsive and even irrational, because it's not as if he's

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.280
[Amit Varma]: read like five books by this guy, and he, you know, really believes in his worldview

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.280
[Amit Varma]: and all that.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:51.160
[Amit Varma]: It's just that he's following some kind of an instinct to attain some kind of spiritual

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.160
[Amit Varma]: growth.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:57.280
[Amit Varma]: And for much of that early period, like after Mian Mir dies, we see this, you know, you

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.880
[Amit Varma]: talk about the visions he's having.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:04.080
[Amit Varma]: And this seemed like very sort of, I mean, I didn't know what to make of that because

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:09.480
[Amit Varma]: he's having visions where his former teacher comes to him in a dream, there is one vision

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:15.600
[Amit Varma]: where his former teacher sort of unbuttons a shirt and then grabs him and there's this

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:20.400
[Amit Varma]: nipple to nipple contact and it's almost like his heart has, you know, this whole sort of

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.800
[Amit Varma]: mystical exchange of the spirit happens, there are other visions where the Prophet Muhammad

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.760
[Amit Varma]: comes to him in a vision, you know, and if this sort of stuff was to happen in modern

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:35.040
[Amit Varma]: times, you'd really sort of question whether this person needed help, right?

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.200
[Amit Varma]: And but he's a prince and this stuff is happening.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.880
[Amit Varma]: And later, of course, and it seems to me that the whole intellectual exploration where he

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:46.520
[Amit Varma]: writes his book about the lives of the 400 Sufi saints and all that, that comes later.

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:51.960
[Amit Varma]: So is that sort of a misreading on my part, or you know, that the narrative gave me that

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:56.600
[Amit Varma]: impression and what do you make of that early, young questing Dara Shikoh who's doing all

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.960
[Amit Varma]: these things like he literally prostrates himself first before Mian Mir and then when

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:07.000
[Amit Varma]: he goes to Kashmir, you know, Mullah Shah, where he's doing things that no prince should

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.160
[Amit Varma]: really be doing.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.600
[Amit Varma]: But and at that point, you know, you just wonder that these are just religious godmen

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:17.360
[Amit Varma]: at that moment to him, he doesn't know any of them intimately yet, you can develop respect

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.560
[Amit Varma]: later once you get to know them, but he's just falling at their feet and offering himself

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.560
[Amit Varma]: as a disciple.

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.600
[Guest]: So what did you make of all that?

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.600
[Guest]: Thank you.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:31.400
[Guest]: I mean, of course, we live in a time where, you know, from a certain rational perspective,

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:35.400
[Guest]: you know, all of this seems kind of strange and weird.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:41.000
[Guest]: But if you look at even our own times, we find that there is, especially today, the

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.040
[Guest]: political, spiritual, intellectual are actually really deeply enmeshed.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:51.280
[Guest]: And that was the case in Dara Shikoh's time, that it's, you know, hard to separate the

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:56.520
[Guest]: political, for instance, from the spiritual, you know, Tip Akbar, who made these great

00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:02.400
[Guest]: public shows of piety, he would walk barefoot to the shrine of Monyuddin Chishti to pray

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:07.600
[Guest]: for a son, you know, he would give thanks, and so on.

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:14.720
[Guest]: So Dara Shikoh's displays of piety, that he was later telegraphing, not because he wasn't

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.920
[Guest]: an emperor, he didn't have an Abul Fazl, but you know, through his own writings, you know,

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:25.360
[Guest]: I would say these are not merely kind of the rantings of a naive mystical prince with his

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.080
[Guest]: head in the clouds.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.000
[Guest]: He was always making a particular argument.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.560
[Guest]: So for instance, when he talks about his first meeting with, with Mian Mir, and he meets

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:39.960
[Guest]: Mian Mir, his father is actually the one who takes him, so his father, and then later we

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:46.020
[Guest]: learn that even Jahangir had reverence for Mian Mir, so he's an established Sufi figure,

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:50.280
[Guest]: you can see that he has influence, because you know, emperors themselves are going giving

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.800
[Guest]: him respect.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:49:01.760
[Guest]: So he then shows how he had this amazing experience with him, he gets healed, and he shows Mian

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.640
[Guest]: Mir true reverence and piety.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:09.360
[Guest]: And then he makes these kind of little nasty, sort of passive aggressive digs at his own

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:14.400
[Guest]: father and his grandfather saying, yes, you know, and when they went to visit Mian Mir,

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:19.640
[Guest]: they said they wanted to talk about spiritual matters and even sort of like, you know, confided

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:25.480
[Guest]: that we're so sick of rulership, we just want to be like you and, you know, be a recluse

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.480
[Guest]: like you and then Mian Mir sharply rebuked them.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:33.480
[Guest]: So in this case, Dara Shukoh is showing himself in a good light, he's showing himself as the

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:40.200
[Guest]: true Sufi murid, he's a true kind of follower of the path of Sufism, unlike other emperors.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:45.000
[Guest]: And then maybe this means that he has a special spiritual quality that other rulers don't

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.480
[Guest]: have, that he's destined for something really great.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:51.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, the reason I found this striking, because I don't mean this as a criticism of

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:55.320
[Amit Varma]: Dara Shukoh to say, Oh, look at that mad guy, he was having visions, I'm sorry, if it came

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.320
[Amit Varma]: across that way.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.320
[Amit Varma]: That's not what I meant.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:03.160
[Amit Varma]: The why I found these incidences fascinating is that I was trying to, during the book,

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:07.000
[Amit Varma]: and there are times where I felt I got glimpses of this, but I was trying to get a sense of

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.760
[Amit Varma]: what is his interior life, you know, Dara Shukoh's, what's the stuff that what does

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:15.720
[Amit Varma]: he want, you know, what's the stuff that causes turmoil in him, for example, when he does

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:20.200
[Amit Varma]: all of this, like you pointed out, he's trying to portray a side of himself, is he posturing

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.200
[Amit Varma]: for others?

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.160
[Amit Varma]: Is he posturing for himself?

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:27.080
[Amit Varma]: Is there sometimes an element of self delusion to that?

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:31.600
[Amit Varma]: And does all of this, even if let's say he begins to act in a particular way, because

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:37.360
[Amit Varma]: he's posturing for others or for himself, does it then shape what he actually becomes?

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:42.480
[Amit Varma]: Because later on, you know, he's written all these phenomenal books of scholarship, there's

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:47.800
[Amit Varma]: no question that his intellectual engagement with, you know, both Sufism and Islam and

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:52.480
[Amit Varma]: later on the Indic religions at a much later stage was very deep and genuine.

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:58.120
[Amit Varma]: But in this early stage, what I sometimes get a sense of this young person who is floundering

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:03.280
[Amit Varma]: around for an identity and to define his place in the in the bigger scheme, is that a sense

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.280
[Amit Varma]: you got?

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.160
[Amit Varma]: And you've obviously read all his original stuff in the original Persian, right?

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.280
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, do you get a sense of who is this person?

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.280
[Amit Varma]: What does he want?

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.080
[Amit Varma]: I mean, strip away all the history and he's an emperor and all of that.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.080
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:20.200
[Guest]: So, you know, that that raises a lot of interesting questions about how one reads these texts,

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:24.720
[Guest]: how one looks at narratives of the self, this is, you know, we have, we have a very modern

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.840
[Guest]: post enlightenment view of the self.

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:29.400
[Guest]: The self is this autonomous being.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:35.160
[Guest]: We have, you know, our own narratives of inner transformations, conversions, understandings

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.160
[Guest]: and so on.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:41.480
[Guest]: We have now that we use the terms of modern psychotherapy, psychoanalysis to, you know,

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:44.120
[Guest]: to talk about the self.

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:48.640
[Guest]: And there were other ideas that and other concepts that people used to understand the

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.240
[Guest]: self in Dara Shukla's time.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:59.360
[Guest]: So it's hard to make a distinction between public performance and the inner journey of

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.920
[Guest]: the self.

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:05.440
[Guest]: It's very hard to make that distinction because it's not one that Dara Shukla makes, you know,

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:10.560
[Guest]: it's not as though we have a private diary where he's giving us his private outpourings

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:16.040
[Guest]: and then he has another, you know, some other documents that talk about his, his public

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.040
[Guest]: persona.

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:22.200
[Guest]: But I think we can definitely see a journey and a trajectory when Dara Shukla plunges

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:28.520
[Guest]: into spiritual affairs, again, it's, it's not merely kind of cold and instrumental that

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:33.240
[Guest]: he's like just going and paying respects to some, you know, Sufi because he has to, because

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.920
[Guest]: it's part of his duty.

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:40.600
[Guest]: He is actually working on cultivating and transforming the self.

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:46.900
[Guest]: And this has been a preoccupation in India in many, many contexts, whether one sees this

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:52.080
[Guest]: in the concept of the Rajarshi, you know, the kind of, again, the ruler who is also

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.080
[Guest]: an ascetic.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:59.080
[Guest]: So we have lots of other, lots of examples, we have lots of examples of, you know, sages,

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:05.160
[Guest]: ascetics, renunciants from different religious traditions who, who would work on this.

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:11.720
[Guest]: And we have a whole tradition of rulers who either renounced the throne or stayed on the

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:14.740
[Guest]: throne and engaged in asceticism.

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:20.840
[Guest]: So it's, it's not surprising that later on, one of the models for Dara Shukla is Ram,

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:27.440
[Guest]: not the Ram necessarily of the Ramayan, you know, who is in exile and then becomes a ruler

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.440
[Guest]: of Ayodhya.

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:36.200
[Guest]: But this is the Ram of the Yoga Vasishta, where Ram is a young prince and his guru Vasishta

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:42.800
[Guest]: takes him on the spiritual journey by telling him a whole range of interlocking stories.

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:47.760
[Guest]: One story leads to the other story, and Ram is reaching different levels of spiritual

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:52.400
[Guest]: perfection, finally, until he reaches Jivanmukti.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:57.880
[Guest]: And it's this idea of Jivanmukti was one that was very attractive to Mughal emperors, you

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:04.160
[Guest]: know, Jahangir had beautifully lavishly illustrated manuscripts of the Yoga Vasishta, there was

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.400
[Guest]: one that was translated for Akbar, you know, Jahangir had a special one translated.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.200
[Guest]: Dara Shukla was also very interested in this text, and even though all the others had their

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.840
[Guest]: own versions, he also got his own version of it.

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:20.480
[Guest]: And it was a text that, in different abridgments, circulated all around South Asia.

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:26.480
[Guest]: And even today, you know, whether it's the Yoga Vasishta, or whether it's a similar Vedic

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.800
[Guest]: text on liberation, you find them everywhere, they're very popular, circulated by Gita Press,

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.040
[Guest]: they're found in railway stations, and so on.

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:38.360
[Guest]: So it's an idea of enduring satisfaction, because at this point, this was a way in which

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:44.640
[Guest]: a king or a ruler could be liberated, and then he could still carry out his royal tasks.

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:47.240
[Guest]: So, you know, what could be better than that?

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:53.720
[Guest]: And then later on, these ideas became very important for merchants, especially for those

00:54:53.720 --> 00:55:02.000
[Guest]: of the middle castes, you know, so they weren't necessarily going and kind of being ascetics,

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:07.480
[Guest]: they were engaged in earning money, they were engaged in the material world.

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:11.960
[Guest]: And at the same time, they cultivated a great sense of asceticism, you know, we see that

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:16.760
[Guest]: with certain version of business families, you know, there's a great emphasis on personal

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:23.240
[Guest]: asceticism, as well as amassing a lot of material wealth in the world.

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:29.600
[Guest]: And so how do you balance that, you know, the Yoga Vasishta is a good guide for that,

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.080
[Amit Varma]: which Ganesh also found quite useful.

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:36.120
[Amit Varma]: So would it be fair to say, and I'm just thinking aloud that then there are two sort of dual

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.200
[Amit Varma]: imperatives that seem to come into play.

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:43.460
[Amit Varma]: And one is that you are an emperor, and you have conquered all the lands you can conquer,

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.640
[Amit Varma]: but you cannot conquer death.

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.640
[Amit Varma]: So what do we do?

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.040
[Amit Varma]: And that sort of leads to this quest.

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:50.600
[Amit Varma]: But the other side of that is that, actually, you've conquered nothing, because you've got

00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:55.040
[Amit Varma]: relatives plotting against you, and every moment is stressful in some way or the other.

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.680
[Amit Varma]: And you got to watch your back.

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:59.120
[Amit Varma]: And this stuff gives you some release.

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.400
[Amit Varma]: So you know, would both of these be factors, you think?

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.400
[Guest]: Yes, you know, I definitely agree.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:11.440
[Guest]: I mean, Dara Shukoh, he certainly was going far deeper down this route than a lot of other

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.440
[Guest]: Mughals.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:16.840
[Guest]: Again, you know, but he wasn't unique, you know, his brother Murad had a Sufi peer, and

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:20.680
[Guest]: he was always in contact with him, and the peer was always giving him guidance.

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:24.640
[Guest]: Aurangzeb met a whole range of peers, Aurangzeb was more savvy in that way, you know, he didn't

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.680
[Guest]: put all his eggs in one basket.

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:32.640
[Guest]: But Shuja also paid reverence to Mullah Shah, the Sufi peer of Shah Jahan's household, and

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.640
[Guest]: especially Dara Shukoh.

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:40.280
[Guest]: So there were ways in which all the others were doing this, but Dara more than the others

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:45.600
[Guest]: was really cultivating himself as the quintessential philosopher, you know.

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:49.760
[Amit Varma]: It's also interesting how in the book, you talk about the influence on the Mughal kings

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:55.520
[Amit Varma]: of the example of Alexander, like you point out how Jahangir in one of his books quotes

00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.640
[Amit Varma]: this following line, quote, sovereignty brooks no bonds between fathers and sons and emperor

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:06.040
[Amit Varma]: has no relatives, stock quote, which you point out is from the Iskandar Nama by Nizami Ganjavi,

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.520
[Amit Varma]: which is, again, about Alexander.

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:13.320
[Amit Varma]: And there are these two sides to Alexander, both of which seem very relevant to Dara Shukoh.

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:17.800
[Amit Varma]: One is, of course, that you have no friends, and you got to watch out for your brothers.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:23.560
[Amit Varma]: And as we've seen in Shah Jahan and Jahangir and earlier that, and in, of course, poor

00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:27.440
[Amit Varma]: Dara Shukoh's own generation that you basically have to get rid of all your brothers and nephews

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.840
[Amit Varma]: or at the very least blind them.

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:34.240
[Amit Varma]: So that's one angle where he's growing up, he is the chosen one of the emperor.

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.280
[Amit Varma]: But he's got an eye, he's the eldest son, but there's no primogenitor.

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:40.520
[Amit Varma]: So it isn't that, you know, the eldest son automatically becomes king.

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.400
[Amit Varma]: So he's got an eye on the prize.

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:46.200
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you've pointed out how in the book, he'll try to influence things his father

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:50.480
[Amit Varma]: does about, you know, sending Aurangzeb somewhere or, you know, making sure that two of the

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:55.120
[Amit Varma]: other brothers don't meet so they can't plot with each other and all of that.

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:59.880
[Amit Varma]: So on the one hand, there is that very realpolitik kind of, you know, eye on the throne, watch

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.320
[Amit Varma]: out for everyone and beware of your brothers.

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:05.680
[Amit Varma]: And on the other side, there is that intellectual and spiritual quest.

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:10.400
[Amit Varma]: And Alexander, of course, also famously was on his own kind of intellectual quest.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:14.840
[Amit Varma]: And you also see that mirroring itself out, you know, very often on a tangent, it's very

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:19.320
[Amit Varma]: hard for me to imagine those times, because how do people gain the knowledge of the world?

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:22.360
[Amit Varma]: There are no books, there's no television, there's no internet, there's nothing.

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:26.080
[Amit Varma]: And yet you have these heroes like Alexander and Timur and all of that.

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:30.720
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, one wonders what is the popular culture of the time and where do you learn

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:31.920
[Amit Varma]: your history from?

00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:36.520
[Amit Varma]: And yet, you know, people like Alexander and Timur are clearly examples.

00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:40.920
[Amit Varma]: How much of this would have sort of played a part in Dara's becoming who he was like

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:46.200
[Amit Varma]: one is he's wrestling with these dual imperatives of very early real world imperative or watch

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:51.440
[Amit Varma]: out for your brothers and do what you gotta do to, you know, be the next big boy.

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:55.340
[Amit Varma]: And the other one is that whole intellectual and spiritual quest he's on.

00:58:55.340 --> 00:59:00.280
[Amit Varma]: And some of it comes from phobias like Alexander, like maybe Timur in terms of the sort of empirary

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:04.560
[Amit Varma]: wars or even Akbar, though, as you say, he doesn't acknowledge Akbar much, but even Akbar

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:10.520
[Amit Varma]: in terms of the syncretism and the way he sort of is open to other cultures.

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:15.520
[Amit Varma]: Is there a sense that these made a difference to Dara Shikoh in shaping him, the person

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.360
[Amit Varma]: he was and what he went on to become?

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:18.360
[Guest]: Yes, absolutely.

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:23.560
[Guest]: So all of these were models for Timurid kings.

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:28.720
[Guest]: And you know, you're right in that they weren't printed books, the way we have printed today.

00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:33.200
[Guest]: So books didn't, they were expensive, they didn't circulate in the same way.

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.120
[Guest]: But books are very important.

00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:42.560
[Guest]: You know, the invention of writing and of the written codex, you know, meant that you

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:47.280
[Guest]: could you could really have the whole world between two covers, you know, in a sort of

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.360
[Guest]: bundle of papers.

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:56.560
[Guest]: And more libraries, of course, also famous, Dara Shikoh had the advantage of several generations

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.560
[Guest]: of collection.

00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:03.480
[Guest]: He also, you know, got his own, acquired his own manuscripts and sponsored the copying

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.480
[Guest]: of others.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.480
[Guest]: So books did circulate, you know, they just not to the extent that they do, but they did

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.480
[Guest]: circulate.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:17.160
[Guest]: And we can see that ideas circulated and ideas spilled out of books and circulated and permeated

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.320
[Guest]: the popular imagination.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:26.960
[Guest]: So the idea of Alexander as a powerful conqueror, and as a powerful conqueror, he also was successful

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.960
[Guest]: in India.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960
[Guest]: He overpowered Indians.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.320
[Guest]: So there's that.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:36.720
[Guest]: And he also was a philosophical ruler, he would have dialogues, a kind of Darbar sort

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:42.120
[Guest]: of similar to the dialogues that Akbar had with philosophers in his Abadadkhana.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:47.280
[Guest]: So these dual roles of Alexander came to be very important.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:52.400
[Guest]: And I think Alexander is one of the overlooked models for the Mughal, the Indian Timurid

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.680
[Guest]: kings.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:01:01.160
[Guest]: So these past figures were very, very important for Mughal rulers, and they were constantly

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.160
[Guest]: invoked.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:07.240
[Guest]: Definitely Temur, you know, Temur is one of them, you know, somebody who Shah Jahan very

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:13.560
[Guest]: consciously modelled himself on, and, you know, helped circulate his spurious memoirs

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:18.600
[Guest]: that gained a lot of popularity, but honestly, he never vanishes.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:23.800
[Guest]: It becomes very common for people to talk about the second Sikandar, you know, you might

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:30.760
[Guest]: even have heard that, you know, so one of the bitter ironies of the story, and one reason

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.640
[Guest]: why I bring up Alexander at the beginning, in the context of Jahangir and the dialogues

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:40.320
[Guest]: that are taking place at Jahangir's court, is because, yes, of course, this both sides

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:47.080
[Guest]: of Alexander to different degrees become important for Shah Jahan's sons, and for Dara Shukoh,

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:51.120
[Guest]: and then you know that, you know, that of course, so Alexander defeats Darius, you know,

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.440
[Guest]: the emperor whom Dara is also named for.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:02:00.240
[Guest]: And then finally, after the Battle of Samogar, you know, there's a poet who says, now in

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.120
[Guest]: this case, you have the second, the Sikandar, who is defeating Dara.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:09.280
[Guest]: So that becomes, so there is this bitter irony that, you know, we have Dara Shukoh, who is

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:18.640
[Guest]: modeling himself on Alexander, you know, on Alexander as a portrait in Persian poetry.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:24.760
[Guest]: And then, then we actually have Aurangzeb, who truly becomes the second Sikandar and

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.320
[Guest]: defeats his brother Dara.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.120
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk a bit about the religious landscape of the time, like another sort of false binary

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:35.080
[Amit Varma]: that seems to have come down is that, you know, is of orthodox Islam, the Sunnis on

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.880
[Amit Varma]: the one side, and then you have the Sufis on the other side, who don't really, you know,

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:43.580
[Amit Varma]: believe in all of those conventions and are much more free flowing, so to say.

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.560
[Amit Varma]: As you point out, this isn't quite true, like you refer to how Dara Shukoh in his first

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.920
[Amit Varma]: book Safina Tulaliya assigned himself as Muhammad Dara Shukoh, Hanafi Qadiri.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.880
[Amit Varma]: And Hanafi, of course, as a nod to the orthodox elements in Qadiri is, you know, one of the

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:58.880
[Amit Varma]: Sufi strands.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.320
[Amit Varma]: Therefore, sort of point Qadiri, and therefore sort of pointing out that there's nothing

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.960
[Amit Varma]: incongruous about those going together.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:08.800
[Amit Varma]: And you speak of sort of the interplay between that.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:13.880
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that landscape and how the sort of explorations that Dara

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:18.600
[Amit Varma]: Shukoh was making, were they as unusual as they are made out to be today?

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.240
[Amit Varma]: Or was it all par for the course in those times?

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:29.080
[Guest]: So I would say both things are true in that, yes, there were sections at the court who

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:32.720
[Guest]: might have been disapproving of what Dara Shukoh engaged in.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.800
[Guest]: It was also hard to say, you know, who an alim was, who is a member of the ulema.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.640
[Guest]: You know, if you look at any kind of modern Bollywood movie on the mobiles, then you might

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:48.840
[Guest]: see these kind of black robed people who are always like plucking and tuck-tutting about

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:54.200
[Guest]: things that are going on, you know, say Emperor Akbar has a wife and she's doing puja, you

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.160
[Guest]: know, and then like, they get really upset about that.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:05.920
[Guest]: So you know, a very easily visible group who don't stand for pluralism, you know, who are

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.960
[Guest]: very close minded.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:11.800
[Guest]: And this stems from modern developments.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:19.640
[Guest]: So the idea of the ulema as a very closed social group who are separate from Sufis is

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.440
[Guest]: something that happens at a later stage in South Asia.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:30.560
[Guest]: Now at this stage in the 17th century, a lot of, you know, who, you know, an alim, a member

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:34.320
[Guest]: of the ulema, is really, is a learned person.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.720
[Guest]: And a lot of these people had roles at the court.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.960
[Guest]: So they juggled multiple tasks and responsibilities.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:47.280
[Guest]: And many of them had initiation in different Sufi orders.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:55.200
[Guest]: So the idea of a Sufism that, again, is more tolerant, heterodox, and it's totally separate

01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:02.760
[Guest]: from the more judicial world, legalistic world of the ulema, is not something that we see

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:09.880
[Guest]: when we look at the court chronicles and when we look at lists of who an alim is, for instance.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:14.800
[Guest]: So they might have a list of the ulema and the hukama and the fuzala, you know, so the

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.960
[Guest]: people who are considered to be learned.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:21.400
[Guest]: And you know, these could be physicians.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:26.040
[Guest]: These could be people who are well versed in Islamic law, but they also have initiation

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.560
[Guest]: in a Sufi order.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:33.960
[Guest]: One such person could have, his main job could be managing the emperor's household, you know,

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960
[Guest]: as well.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.400
[Guest]: So it's not as though there, you know, there was like the separate like room or council

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:43.000
[Guest]: of ulema who didn't have other worldly responsibilities.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.760
[Guest]: And you know, their sole job was to release what was acceptable and respectable and what

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.760
[Guest]: wasn't.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:53.600
[Guest]: At the same time, there were different strands of thought, you know, amongst Sufis also.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:58.680
[Guest]: There were Sufis who leaned towards the more ecstatic sides of the side of things.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:08.600
[Guest]: For instance, those who enjoyed or propagated listening to music, musical audition.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:14.040
[Guest]: And then there were Sufis who espoused a more sober form of religiosity.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:18.640
[Guest]: So there were definitely divisions, but the divisions did not fall along the lines of

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.680
[Amit Varma]: Sufis versus ulema.

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:24.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, having looked at Dara Shikoh, let's also talk about Aurangzeb, because one of

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:28.040
[Amit Varma]: the things you sort of demonstrate in your book as well is that the traditional view

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:34.840
[Amit Varma]: of him as this austere religious bigot who did not, you know, who was extremely orthodox,

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:42.080
[Amit Varma]: did not have any regard for the arts and all of that is not quite true either.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:46.440
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit about the young Aurangzeb, especially again, I was sort of struck trying

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:53.080
[Amit Varma]: to, by the glimpses one got of the human aspects of him, for example, just as, you know, Dara

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:57.080
[Amit Varma]: is close to his elder sister Jahanara and they share so many of the same interests in

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.880
[Amit Varma]: terms of religion and all of that.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.560
[Amit Varma]: We find that Aurangzeb is also close to Jahanara and he's always, you know, going and meeting

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.840
[Amit Varma]: her and obviously regards her very much.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:12.920
[Amit Varma]: And there's also a sense where you speak about how, you know, Dara's sort of in court in

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:18.920
[Amit Varma]: Lahore and Aurangzeb has, you know, is visiting from somewhere else.

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:23.320
[Amit Varma]: And he's very upset because Dara is not giving him the importance he feels he deserves.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.040
[Amit Varma]: It's almost as if he wants his elder brother to sort of, you know, to love him almost,

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.040
[Amit Varma]: you know.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:34.600
[Amit Varma]: What's the sense that you got of Aurangzeb as an individual during these young years

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.320
[Amit Varma]: who's also growing up and trying to find his identity?

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.320
[Amit Varma]: What's his journey like?

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:43.120
[Guest]: So the thing with Aurangzeb is because he becomes emperor later on.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:49.200
[Guest]: So anything that he wrote is of high value and is preserved and circulated.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:55.320
[Guest]: So we have a whole range of letters that Aurangzeb has written and these letters get collected

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.880
[Guest]: and they circulate later on.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:02.200
[Guest]: So, you know, so we don't have them necessarily all of them like directly from Aurangzeb,

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.200
[Guest]: you know, with the seal.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:07.240
[Guest]: We don't have those original documents, but you have the letters as they are preserved

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:11.640
[Guest]: in later collections, collections that were made during his lifetime.

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:17.480
[Guest]: So we do, we have that advantage in that we can see his own personal, we can hear his

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:23.000
[Guest]: own personal voice more clearly than we can a lot of the other mughals.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.120
[Guest]: And through these letters, we see that there are a number of letters he writes to his elder

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.840
[Guest]: sister Jahanara.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.360
[Guest]: The popular perception is that he was close to Roshanara, Dara Shukoh was close to Jahanara

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:38.600
[Guest]: and Murad was close to Goharara and, you know, so there were these different factions that

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.600
[Guest]: were formed.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:45.640
[Guest]: And we really see Jahanara's role as family peacemaker.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.800
[Guest]: She maintains a good relationship with all her brothers.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.760
[Guest]: She really goes out of her way to do that.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:56.240
[Guest]: She goes out of her way to try to smooth over any difficulties that they might have, tries

01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:01.080
[Guest]: to entertain meetings between them, for instance, and, you know, perhaps she engineers reconciliation

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:07.080
[Guest]: or tries to between Dara and Aurangzeb when Dara is serving as governor of Lahore.

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:11.960
[Guest]: And we get glimpses of like the sisterly relationship that she has with Aurangzeb.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:15.000
[Guest]: She's always writing to him more than he writes to her.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
[Guest]: She's sending him various gifts, you know, murabbas and, you know, like various like

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.720
[Guest]: treats and delicacies, you know, so we get a sense of the human side of Aurangzeb through

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.360
[Guest]: these affectionate letters that he writes to his sister.

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.280
[Guest]: And we also get a sense of his grievances.

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:40.480
[Guest]: That also has to do with the nature of the sources because a lot of the argument that

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:48.280
[Guest]: is made later on to justify Dara Shukoh's murder and Aurangzeb's accession to the throne

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:53.360
[Guest]: is that Dara Shukoh was really, apart from the fact that, you know, he was supposed to

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:59.280
[Guest]: be an infidel and so on, that Dara Shukoh was not really a good son and a good brother.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:06.160
[Guest]: He was, he took over at the helm of affairs from his father, he was not fair to his brothers.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:11.760
[Guest]: So that could also color the kinds of sources that are later preserved and circulated that

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.200
[Guest]: show Aurangzeb to be a sensitive sibling.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:24.240
[Guest]: At the same time, you know, we do get a sense, you know, that he enjoyed listening to music

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:30.760
[Guest]: when he was a prince, he might have, you know, there is this album that's associated with

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.280
[Guest]: him, like supposed to be a stunning album of art, if indeed it is found and found to

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:41.520
[Guest]: be authentic, that would give us an amazing picture of his own artistic sponsorship and

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.320
[Guest]: interest when he was a prince.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:50.360
[Guest]: So in these regards, he was not so different from other Mughal princes who were patrons

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:58.320
[Guest]: of the arts and so on, you know, they cultivated their own aesthetic side as just part of being

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.560
[Guest]: elite Mughals.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:06.040
[Guest]: He did temper that later on, you know, partly to show himself in contrast to his brother,

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:11.880
[Guest]: you know, so he, there was a change, there's definitely, you know, like far less sponsorship

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:16.680
[Guest]: of cultural activities when he was emperor.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:22.480
[Amit Varma]: And one of the thoughts that kind of struck me while reading the book was that in one

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:27.600
[Amit Varma]: curious aspect, Aurangzeb reminded me of Indira Gandhi, in the sense that when Indira Gandhi

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:33.520
[Amit Varma]: needed to rebrand herself and distinguish herself from the syndicate in the late 1960s,

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:37.960
[Amit Varma]: she took this massive leftward turn to set herself apart, because that was the only way

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.600
[Amit Varma]: to sort of distinguish herself as a brand.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:46.080
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that in some ways, would it be fair to say that, you know, those could

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:54.960
[Amit Varma]: be the imperatives behind Aurangzeb also moving in that more doctrinaire, sort of rigid direction

01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:01.120
[Amit Varma]: to distinguish himself from his main rival for the throne, which was Dara Shago and even

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.480
[Amit Varma]: perhaps to some extent from his father.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:09.360
[Amit Varma]: So would you say that those incentives also kind of came into play?

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:15.080
[Guest]: Most definitely, you know, I think, I think it took Aurangzeb a little while to fully

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:21.080
[Guest]: define himself by abandoning the traditions of his forebears, you know, whether it's the

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:25.400
[Guest]: Jharkha Darshan, you know, where the emperor kind of sits and has, you know, everyone view

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:32.920
[Guest]: him at this Jharkha, which is an institution that Akbar really established and popularized.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:36.240
[Guest]: So it took him a while, you know, it didn't all happen overnight.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:40.640
[Guest]: But there was this process by which, you know, even during the struggle for succession, you

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:45.920
[Guest]: can see that there are some insinuations about heresy on the part of Dara Shago.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:51.320
[Guest]: And these insinuations get solidified once he becomes emperor so that he does have a

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.520
[Guest]: solid case that's built up.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:59.000
[Guest]: And he then has his own very austere model of kingship that again is a departure from

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.880
[Amit Varma]: his ancestors.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.600
[Amit Varma]: And just thinking aloud, would it be then fair to say that wherever you have this sort

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:09.920
[Amit Varma]: of a conflict, it's bound to be a polarizing one and it's bound to drive people towards

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:10.920
[Amit Varma]: the extremes?

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:15.280
[Amit Varma]: Like you could argue that, you know, Aurangzeb might have been not as extreme as he was,

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.920
[Amit Varma]: but he felt the need to define himself.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.720
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, in modern times, if you look at Pakistan, would it be fair to say that to

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:26.320
[Amit Varma]: some extent, they are shaped by their need to define themselves in opposition to what

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.800
[Amit Varma]: India is, for example?

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:32.960
[Guest]: Yes, you know, I think that's, that's really happening on both sides, you know, just take

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:38.520
[Guest]: language, for instance, the way in which the Urdu language has developed in Pakistan, official

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:44.080
[Guest]: Urdu, is highly Persianized, there are a lot of Persian and Arabic neologisms, there are

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:49.640
[Guest]: many ways in which there's an attempt to look westwards, to look at West Asia, you know,

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:54.360
[Guest]: for cultural models, as opposed to India, of course, one can't totally sort of build

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.360
[Guest]: a wall.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:01.360
[Guest]: There are still lots of commonalities and lots of cultural interactions, you know, similarly

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:09.520
[Guest]: with the official Hindi that is used in television and in officialdom in India today, that these

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:14.920
[Guest]: Hindi and Urdu have become two languages that are not so easily mutually intelligible, for

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.880
[Guest]: the language that people speak often, you know, falls in the middle of the spectrum.

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.440
[Amit Varma]: Like, I traveled through Pakistan while covering a cricket tour in 2006, and I spent a month

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.440
[Amit Varma]: and a half there.

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:28.480
[Amit Varma]: And apart from the Urdu signs, it didn't feel like I was in a foreign country and the language

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.840
[Amit Varma]: is exactly the same and I was sort of aware of, you know, the Hindi nationalism, so to

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:37.000
[Amit Varma]: say, and how Shuddh Hindi is such an artificial construct and has been modeled out of that

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.800
[Amit Varma]: I wasn't aware that there's a similar process happening with Urdu in Pakistan.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:45.920
[Amit Varma]: In fact, just thinking aloud, you know, when I watch Prime Minister Modi's 8pm speeches

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:51.080
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, and it strikes me that the kind of Hindi that he uses very deliberately,

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:55.360
[Amit Varma]: is that kind of Shuddh Hindi which people don't speak and therefore I'm sort of kind

01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:01.400
[Amit Varma]: of baffled by the immense popularity because he's not actually speaking even the language

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.880
[Amit Varma]: of the Hindi heartland.

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:07.020
[Amit Varma]: He's speaking this very Shuddh Hindi, which people don't speak in their everyday lives

01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:10.280
[Amit Varma]: from my experience, so I was but that's, that's an aside.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.720
[Amit Varma]: Kind of moving on, you know, and again, earlier, I spoke about how it seemed to me through

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:20.080
[Amit Varma]: the book that you have sort of Tara evolving in stages where, you know, initially, it felt

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.640
[Amit Varma]: like a spiritual journey, and then there's an intellectual ballast to it.

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.680
[Amit Varma]: And he writes these different books.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:31.320
[Amit Varma]: And then after he's comes back from his failed conquest of Kandahar, there is this deeper

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:36.280
[Amit Varma]: turn and this engagement with the Indic philosophies, which wasn't there earlier.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:41.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, more specifically, the project of translating the Upanishads into Persian.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, he even had a theory that the Upanishads were the lost book mentioned in the Quran,

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.240
[Amit Varma]: for example.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.880
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that phase.

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:52.960
[Amit Varma]: And what do you think drove that phase because it doesn't seem to be, you know, like it's

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:59.280
[Amit Varma]: been speculated that part of it was because he was trying to get alliances among the Rajputs

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.160
[Amit Varma]: and he wanted to portray that image.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:04.660
[Amit Varma]: But this seems a bit too far to go for the sake of posturing.

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:08.480
[Amit Varma]: And also the fact of the matter, as you've pointed out, is that, you know, the Rajputs

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.480
[Amit Varma]: were equally divided in Aurangzeb's camp as in Dara Shikoh's camp.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:16.760
[Amit Varma]: This is simply a post facto binary we have kind of invented.

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:22.320
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about his new deepening interest into sort of the Indic philosophies.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.720
[Guest]: So I think there are a couple of things going on here.

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:31.840
[Guest]: One is the deepening and widening of Dara Shikoh's own spiritual intellectual interests,

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:37.400
[Guest]: which come from a genuine curiosity and also a kind of restlessness.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:45.800
[Guest]: So Dara Shikoh is, he feels that he has perhaps had his fill of Sufism, not, you know, not

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:50.960
[Guest]: in the sense that he's kind of completed, but he's already ascended these amazing spiritual

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.440
[Guest]: heights.

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.720
[Guest]: He's done what he can.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:59.000
[Guest]: He's now speaking not as a disciple, but he's really speaking as a master who is giving

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.800
[Guest]: instruction on the Sufi path.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:05.640
[Guest]: And you can see seeds of his interest in Indic thought.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:13.400
[Guest]: And there's already a basis for this, because in Sufi writings and poetry, there is the

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:16.920
[Guest]: celebration of what is not Islam.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:22.760
[Guest]: There's the celebration of what is called kufr, you know, or infidelity.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:27.040
[Guest]: And the celebration is something that's, it's really complicated, you know, it doesn't mean

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:35.320
[Guest]: that everyone has to go out and just do things that are completely against religion.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:43.240
[Guest]: But the poetry, certain Sufi writings, give a space for this in order to really ascend

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:49.240
[Guest]: higher spiritual levels and metaphorically see the countenance of the beloved, you know,

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:50.240
[Guest]: which is the divine.

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.640
[Guest]: So Dara Shukh was already, you know, even before this, he's reaching out to other Sufi

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.640
[Guest]: masters.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:59.240
[Guest]: You know, he's achieved what he's wanted to with the Qadavis and his sister and his father

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.840
[Guest]: continue their relationship with them and so does Dara, but you know, Dara doesn't stay

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.840
[Guest]: with that.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:10.160
[Guest]: You know, he writes to other people and what he doesn't want to do is to go into the real

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:16.640
[Guest]: nitty gritties of philosophical Sufism, which he can if he wants to, you know, this famous

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:22.640
[Guest]: Andalusian mystic, Ibn Arabi, whose very, very complex and abstruse Arabic writings

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:27.680
[Guest]: have been translated and commented upon in India, in the Indian subcontinent.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:32.320
[Guest]: One of the most famous interpreters of Ibn Arabi is Sheikh Muhibbullah Elahabadi, with

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.160
[Guest]: whom Dara has a correspondence.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:39.320
[Guest]: And Dara Shukh wants something that's a little more transgressive and perhaps a little less

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:44.400
[Guest]: arduous than kind of sitting and, you know, like understanding these really difficult

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:45.400
[Guest]: texts.

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:48.960
[Guest]: So he starts getting interested in Indic thought, and there's already a tradition of that.

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:54.480
[Guest]: And there are already several yogic ideas that have been incorporated into Chishti mysticism.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:59.040
[Guest]: And you know, it could be that the Qadavis also have some association with that.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.200
[Guest]: And then he goes even deeper.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:07.080
[Guest]: So when he's coming back from Kandahar, he makes sure to stop and have dialogues with

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:09.480
[Guest]: a Vaishnava ascetic called Baba Lal.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:10.480
[Guest]: And he has all these dialogues.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:15.720
[Guest]: So we have the results of those sessions written down, except that it doesn't seem that these

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:19.040
[Guest]: are really the literal transcripts, there are many different versions of this.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:24.160
[Guest]: But we can see that Dara Shukh has acquainted himself with at least the Persian translations

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:27.720
[Guest]: of the Ramayana and so on, and he has questions.

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:33.440
[Guest]: And I think he finds his dialogues with Baba Lal inspiring enough that he continues and

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.880
[Guest]: he goes further.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:41.320
[Guest]: And he's already compiled a collection of rather shocking, sort of transgressive, ecstatic

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:47.960
[Guest]: sayings of Sufis, and he's included some non-Muslims in them, including Baba Lal.

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:54.120
[Guest]: So once he's in Delhi, he starts branching out, and he already has access to a lot of

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:58.880
[Guest]: works in the Mughal library, but he wants to patronize and sponsor more.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:03.040
[Guest]: And the other thing that's going on is that this is a time when both he and Aurangzeb

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:10.240
[Guest]: are competing to really jockey for alliances and influence amongst Rajput rulers.

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:15.800
[Guest]: So say there's some trouble brewing in Mewar, both of them want to try, they want to be

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:20.600
[Guest]: the first ones to go there and to try to solve it, and they compete by sending their envoys,

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:24.800
[Guest]: Brahmin envoys, like a sensitive choice, and messengers.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:30.200
[Guest]: And later on in the eve of the Battle of Succession, Aurangzeb is also telling Rana Raj, saying,

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:35.400
[Guest]: I'm going to be like my illustrious forebears, I'm going to allow everyone to flourish in

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.920
[Guest]: peace with their own religions, and so on.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:44.000
[Guest]: So Aurangzeb is making this very, very explicit gesture towards fostering an environment of

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
[Guest]: religious pluralism.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:51.320
[Guest]: And Dayaan Shukla is doing it in a less direct way, not that he's not interested, he is,

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:58.840
[Guest]: but one can't wish away this backdrop where they each try to gain influence amongst the

01:20:58.840 --> 01:20:59.840
[Amit Varma]: Rajputs.

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:04.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, all the historians that I've had on my show don't like counterfactuals so much.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:09.520
[Amit Varma]: It's only non historians who love to speculate about, you know, what would have happened

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.240
[Amit Varma]: if this person did this and blah, blah, blah.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:17.240
[Amit Varma]: But nevertheless, given that there is such a dominant narrative around this particular

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:21.880
[Amit Varma]: counterfactual given that, you know, Ashok referred to Dara Shukla's death as the partition

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:26.480
[Amit Varma]: before partition, what is your sense of what kind of an emperor he would have been if he

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.200
[Amit Varma]: had somehow managed to win?

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:32.320
[Amit Varma]: Because really, his managing to win is a few lucky events here and there, like you point

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:36.120
[Amit Varma]: out how when Aurangzeb when getting rid of one of the other brothers pretended he had

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:39.040
[Amit Varma]: dysentery and called him to his tent and plied him with drink.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:43.080
[Amit Varma]: Now Aurangzeb could actually have gotten dysentery and died right in those times.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:46.080
[Amit Varma]: So if Dara Shukla ends up as emperor, what's your brief sense?

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:50.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you've already pointed out that he was like a sort of a co-ruler for a long time

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:54.280
[Amit Varma]: by Shah Jahan's side, and wouldn't have been very different from Aurangzeb because he would

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:59.520
[Amit Varma]: have followed the imperatives of politics and he would have had to kill all his brothers.

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:03.960
[Amit Varma]: Probably I think in the book, you mentioned that when his son, Suleiman is chasing his

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:07.800
[Amit Varma]: brother Shuja across the border, he tells him bring me back his head, something to that

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:08.800
[Amit Varma]: effect.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:09.800
[Amit Varma]: So all of that would have happened.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:14.040
[Amit Varma]: But in terms of the Indian subcontinent, would it have made a difference or would the larger

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:17.600
[Amit Varma]: currents of history have continued going more or less the way they did?

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.600
[Guest]: So it's a difficult question.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:22.640
[Guest]: Of course, one thing to keep in mind is that when the war of succession broke out, Shah

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:26.520
[Guest]: Jahan was ill, he was possibly severely ill.

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:32.200
[Guest]: I actually had a well-known medical specialist from Yale kind of give me his take on what

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:36.080
[Guest]: Shah Jahan's illness might have been, but he survives.

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:38.400
[Guest]: He survives for many years after that.

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:43.640
[Guest]: So Dara would not have been official ruler right away, though he would have been a kind

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:46.800
[Guest]: of co-ruler or proxy ruler along with his father.

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:53.280
[Guest]: So I think perhaps that period of time would have also helped him learn the ropes better

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.480
[Guest]: of rule.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:00.400
[Guest]: He would have tried to be a sacred ruler in the model, again, of his forebears, in the

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.840
[Guest]: model of Akbar.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:08.240
[Guest]: In terms of the broader structural problems of the Mughal Empire, whether what Irfan Habib

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:15.680
[Guest]: has termed the agrarian crisis, the very costly Deccan expansions, for instance, the other

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:19.640
[Guest]: foreign adventures that Shah Jahan liked to fund.

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:24.480
[Guest]: So these were all serious issues, and it's hard to see how Dara Shukoh might have prevented

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.200
[Guest]: that, if at all.

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.200
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:31.320
[Amit Varma]: I think we've spoken a lot about your book, and I'll leave it to readers to read it for

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.320
[Amit Varma]: themselves.

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.320
[Amit Varma]: And of course, I highly recommend it.

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:36.920
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on to what you're working on now.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.560
[Amit Varma]: The book was finished a while back, and of course, there is that whole release cycle

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:43.720
[Amit Varma]: and you have to go around promoting it and all of that.

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.100
[Amit Varma]: But what are you working on now?

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:46.100
[Amit Varma]: What preoccupies you?

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:52.560
[Guest]: I'm working on a book that, in some indirect ways, is a sequel to this, except that it's

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:59.760
[Guest]: not about Aurangzeb, and it's more a history of ideas than a biography of one particular

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:00.760
[Guest]: person.

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:06.280
[Guest]: But the reason why it's connected to this book is because part of the idea starts by

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:14.200
[Guest]: seeing what happens to Dara Shukoh's writings, and that's something that I hint in the epilogue.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:18.680
[Guest]: So Aurangzeb did do his best to efface traces of Dara Shukoh.

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:26.600
[Guest]: He didn't succeed completely, and later rulers and writers did try to complete the work.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:32.520
[Guest]: But what we see, if we look at the manuscripts and circulation of Persian manuscripts, is

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:38.200
[Guest]: that there were lots and lots of people making out copies of Dara Shukoh's writings, circulating

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:42.440
[Guest]: and reading them, and a lot of these happened to be Hindus.

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:49.200
[Guest]: And in Aurangzeb, and even during Aurangzeb, you just see growing numbers of Hindus who

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:51.800
[Guest]: were literate in Persian.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:58.520
[Guest]: So these came to form part of a socially privileged elite administrative class.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:05.000
[Guest]: There were often certain castes that we see that predominated, Kayas, Khatris, certain

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
[Guest]: Brahmins.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.640
[Guest]: They were using Persian just like elite Indians use English today.

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:18.080
[Guest]: English is seen as the passport to success, to a shot at a good upper-middle class life,

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.080
[Guest]: social mobility.

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.600
[Guest]: And at the same time, there are certain groups who are learning English.

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:27.280
[Guest]: I mean, there's not all that much mobility, so the elites are reproducing themselves.

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:32.560
[Guest]: And that's sort of what we see in the 17th and 18th centuries, but we see these growing

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:37.760
[Guest]: numbers of Hindus who come to be part of the vast local bureaucracy, again, Aurangzeb expanded

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:44.080
[Guest]: the bureaucracy, and these Hindus are looking for ways in which to access their sacred texts.

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:47.600
[Guest]: And not all of them are Brahmins, and many of them don't know any Sanskrit.

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:54.200
[Guest]: They might be, of course, conversant in Hindavi and various early forms of Hindi and so on.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:57.060
[Guest]: And they read in Persian, and they write in Persian, and many of them are reading and

01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:00.560
[Guest]: writing Dara Shukla's works, and they're also writing, producing their own works.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.680
[Guest]: They're producing their own religious texts in Persian.

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:09.120
[Guest]: And these people come to be the intermediaries at the time of British colonialism.

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:16.160
[Guest]: So we have the British winning the Battle of Plassey, trying to expand their hold over

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.160
[Guest]: the subcontinent.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.960
[Guest]: And they also, they want to learn about the peoples over which they rule.

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:24.960
[Guest]: They want to devise laws and so on to apply and use in their courts.

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:30.680
[Guest]: And they, initially, Brahmins are reluctant to teach them Sanskrit, and they find people

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:32.160
[Guest]: to teach them Persian.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.600
[Guest]: And Persian is the first language that they use for governing.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:42.960
[Guest]: So there is this whole class of munchies and translators, literatures, who are either tutors

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:48.360
[Guest]: to colonial officials or informants to them, who are telling them about Indian customs

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.960
[Guest]: and Indian religions, and this is what Hinduism is all about.

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:57.960
[Guest]: And part of this is being shaped just by what colonial sponsors and patrons want to learn,

01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.800
[Guest]: and part of this is being shaped by what these informants are telling them.

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:07.800
[Guest]: So there is this collaborative process that is creating a huge, huge body of work in Persian

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:10.480
[Guest]: that is about religion in India.

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:12.640
[Amit Varma]: And what's the impact of this work?

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:16.840
[Guest]: So the impact of this is, it's shaping colonial policy.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:23.360
[Guest]: It's also shaping how Hindus, in this case, are presenting themselves and thinking about

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.920
[Guest]: themselves.

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:29.640
[Guest]: So it's in dialogue with other broader trends that are taking place, that would have taken

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:33.800
[Guest]: place in the 18th century, regardless of colonialism.

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:39.520
[Guest]: And it's also influenced by the kinds of things that colonial officials wanted to learn, and

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:44.280
[Guest]: it's creating new centers of patronage, competing centers.

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:50.960
[Guest]: So for instance, in the 18th century, we have Delhi being sacked, there are numerous attacks,

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:56.840
[Guest]: of course, there are various Afghan attacks on Delhi, there are the Marathas, and then

01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:03.400
[Guest]: we have centers that are further east that are really gaining in prominence and in cultural

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.400
[Guest]: vibrancy.

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:10.360
[Guest]: Whether it's Fezabad or Lucknow or Benares, the population of Benares becomes double that

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.360
[Guest]: of Delhi.

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.120
[Guest]: We have Calcutta and so on.

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:18.200
[Guest]: So we have all these centers that are becoming centers of patronage, and these are becoming

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:24.200
[Guest]: hubs of Persian literature, like Benares, which we associate with Sanskrit and Sanskrit

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:29.800
[Guest]: learning also becomes a hub of Persian, partly because of the East India Company and their

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:33.800
[Guest]: interest in the region.

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.840
[Guest]: And we have all these Hindus, this network of Hindus who are traveling, who are producing

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.440
[Guest]: knowledge in Persian.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:47.240
[Guest]: And to me, this is an interesting angle on the prehistory of later developments.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:52.920
[Guest]: So it's often been neglected because it's the historians of the Mughal period of what's

01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:57.120
[Guest]: called medieval Indian history, but what we also call the early modern period, who tend

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.120
[Guest]: to use Persian.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:03.280
[Guest]: And often historians of the modern period tend to look at sources in other languages.

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.960
[Guest]: You know, again, not hard and fast rules, but these are the trends.

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:13.720
[Guest]: So I wanted to see what certain elite Hindus were reading and writing, because I wanted

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:18.280
[Guest]: to look at the history and trajectory of certain ideas.

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:23.800
[Guest]: The idea of universalism, for instance, or the idea that there is a kind of core monotheistic

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:26.680
[Guest]: essence to religion, no matter what you call it.

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:30.800
[Guest]: Some people called it Sanatan Dharm, some people kind of just called it religion or

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.000
[Guest]: the essence of Hinduism.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:39.760
[Guest]: So it's the evolution of Hinduism into something that was stripped down, universal, that had

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:46.240
[Guest]: its roots in Mughal Indology, and that also becomes sort of seen as the cultural matrix

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.240
[Guest]: of India.

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:51.240
[Guest]: So I find that Persian and Urdu sources are really an interesting lens through which to

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.240
[Amit Varma]: look at that.

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:57.520
[Amit Varma]: Would it then be the case that this sort of stripping down of Hinduism or, you know, getting

01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:01.680
[Amit Varma]: to broad core principles and all of that is happening partly because of the language?

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.940
[Amit Varma]: Is the language shaping the content?

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:08.640
[Amit Varma]: Is the fact that this is, you know, a bunch of Brahmins who are speaking and writing in

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:11.920
[Amit Varma]: what is essentially till that point a foreign language?

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:15.880
[Amit Varma]: Does it change the nature of the content that is being produced?

01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:21.240
[Amit Varma]: Is it more universal and say less insular than the content that might otherwise be produced

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:25.360
[Amit Varma]: at that time in Sanskrit or Hindavi or whatever the local languages are?

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.040
[Guest]: That's an interesting question.

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:34.120
[Guest]: And I find that there are ways in which the language definitely shapes what's being produced.

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:39.480
[Guest]: There are certain texts that are just more receptive to translation, but it doesn't entirely

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:40.480
[Guest]: shape that.

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:47.680
[Guest]: So we do have a lot of Advaitic texts that are being circulated, but this isn't only

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:48.680
[Guest]: happening in Persian.

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:52.400
[Guest]: So what's happening in Persian also mirrors what is happening in Hindavi.

01:30:52.400 --> 01:31:00.320
[Guest]: So we have this whole series of Braj Bhasha translations of Advaitic texts that become

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.320
[Guest]: really popular.

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:06.360
[Guest]: So we have a kind of vernacularization of Vedanta and Persian is contributing to and

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:12.160
[Guest]: mirroring this trend, but all of this is laying the groundwork for Vedanta being seen as the

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:14.760
[Guest]: kind of essence of Hinduism later on.

01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:19.880
[Guest]: So we have the popularization of Vedanta that is taking place and Persian is a major driver

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:20.880
[Guest]: for that.

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:28.520
[Guest]: And I don't know how, to what extent Persian is being seen as a foreign language, you know,

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:33.200
[Guest]: by some perhaps, but by others, you know, they are very, very comfortable with it.

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.080
[Guest]: Just like English, for instance.

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:36.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:41.280
[Amit Varma]: Much as English is very much an Indian language today, so no one should complain about words

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.560
[Amit Varma]: like preporn.

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:46.440
[Amit Varma]: And question I'll ask about this project then, I mean, it sounds incredibly fascinating and

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:51.880
[Amit Varma]: I wasn't aware that Persian was so widely used within the subcontinent by people who

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:57.360
[Amit Varma]: weren't part of the empire per se, but then what's the broad aha moment there?

01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:00.040
[Amit Varma]: What drove you to the project and what excited you about it?

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:05.040
[Guest]: Well, one of the things that drove me to this was when you look at figures who seem to be

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:10.800
[Guest]: really key to the evolution of modern Hindu thought, like Radha Ram Mohan Roy, you know,

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:15.720
[Guest]: his initial writings, his initial book, the Tawfat al Mawahidin, is in Persian, you know,

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.440
[Guest]: with an Arabic introduction.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:22.040
[Guest]: It was initially written in Persian, you know, I found that that work is in dialogue with

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:27.240
[Guest]: the writings of various other Hindus and Muslims, you know, people who considered themselves

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:32.200
[Guest]: kind of sort of freethinkers, but who were very also not shaped by the colonial context

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:35.560
[Guest]: who are resident in Banaras and he's supposed to have traveled to Banaras.

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:40.480
[Guest]: So I find that it definitely gives an interesting window onto this.

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:46.720
[Guest]: One of the ways in which I'm personally interested in the study is that among scholars of the

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:50.040
[Guest]: field, there is this perennial debate about Hinduism.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:55.080
[Guest]: And this is something that, you know, no doubt would seem really shocking to many people

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:58.280
[Guest]: in India, people who might consider themselves Hindus.

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:02.680
[Guest]: And the debate is really about whether Hinduism, of course, the English term Hinduism is something

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:05.800
[Guest]: that's pretty modern, you know, from the 18th century.

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:12.080
[Guest]: Is this something that was really shaped and formed under colonial rule?

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:13.640
[Guest]: Or is this something that existed earlier?

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:19.080
[Guest]: You know, there are some scholars of colonialism who are using this not as a way to critique

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:26.920
[Guest]: Indian religions per se, but as a way of critiquing colonialism, showing how the colonial authorities

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:33.920
[Guest]: try to reshape religions, erect strict boundaries around communities, formed these really as

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:39.400
[Guest]: kind of visualized communities and attributed to them, you know, in essence.

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:43.320
[Guest]: So some of this might have been done in a slightly more admiring fashion.

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:46.920
[Guest]: Other part of this project might have been done in a more denigrating fashion.

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:50.320
[Guest]: We have Orientalists who admired aspects of what they studied.

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.800
[Guest]: We have others who thought this was all just all terrible.

01:33:53.800 --> 01:34:00.520
[Guest]: So there is one argument that is really strongly in favor of the colonial construction of Hinduism.

01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:05.080
[Guest]: And those who study the pre-modern period find that no matter what you study, you can

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:08.440
[Guest]: always find some early antecedents for this.

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:14.040
[Guest]: You can find antecedents for a kind of Hindu consolidation if you study Indian philosophy,

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.040
[Guest]: for instance.

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.720
[Guest]: But there's a consolidation of the aspects, you know, against the Gnostics, for instance.

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.400
[Guest]: Well, why did this happen?

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:26.280
[Guest]: It's not something that's very immediately apparent, but it, you know, it could be that

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:32.760
[Guest]: having Muslim rulers or an Islamic presence indirectly kind of nudged a unification or

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:36.560
[Guest]: a consolidation of these philosophical schools.

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:39.080
[Guest]: So it's a perennial question that people are debating.

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:45.400
[Guest]: And one of the actual links between the pre-colonial and the colonial period is Persian, because

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:52.160
[Guest]: that's a bridged language and a whole kind of view on a cultural world that we find operating

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:57.080
[Guest]: seamlessly through the transition from pre-colonial to colonial rule.

01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:01.360
[Amit Varma]: There's a fascinating book about this called, I think, The Truth About Us by Sanjay Chakraborty.

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:06.600
[Amit Varma]: And I also discussed it with Manu Pillay in an old episode where, yeah, I mean, the broad

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:12.800
[Amit Varma]: sense that I had of this period of time and how or what we know as Hinduism as a concept

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:17.560
[Amit Varma]: came about was that, look, the British land up in India and they don't understand the

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:18.560
[Amit Varma]: language.

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.560
[Amit Varma]: They don't understand anything.

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.480
[Amit Varma]: They want to make sense of a complex world.

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:23.240
[Amit Varma]: They need a simple narrative.

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:29.000
[Amit Varma]: Their early interlocutors are these upper caste Brahmins who give them their version

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.840
[Amit Varma]: of what how society is structured and the varna system is very much part of that.

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:37.600
[Amit Varma]: And that kind of one sided view, it forms a convenient narrative through which you view

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:42.360
[Amit Varma]: this exotic land and begin to navigate, you know, Indian society.

01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:44.280
[Amit Varma]: And that becomes the narrative.

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:49.320
[Amit Varma]: And oddly enough, this mistaken narrative by, you know, our colonial rulers becomes

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:55.120
[Amit Varma]: the narrative that then seeps into all of our culture and gets widely accepted.

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:59.840
[Amit Varma]: And regardless of what the intent might be of the British, whether this was a deliberate

01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:03.960
[Amit Varma]: way or and it played into the divide and rule or whether it was unwitting and they were

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:07.180
[Amit Varma]: just trying to what the hell makes sense of the world, how else could they do it?

01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:10.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, but it strikes me while you were speaking just now that intellectual histories

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:16.400
[Amit Varma]: of a period like that must be way more complex than this period, because there are, again,

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.800
[Amit Varma]: so many languages in play.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:22.480
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I had no idea that Persian was such a big part of all of this.

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:27.560
[Amit Varma]: And is the Persian literature of the time then also playing a part in narratives like

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.840
[Guest]: this being built and propagated?

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:30.840
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:34.720
[Guest]: In the 18th century, there was more Persian being produced in India than in Iraq.

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.760
[Guest]: Again, you're absolutely right.

01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:39.280
[Guest]: It's hard to do justice to all the different languages.

01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:43.560
[Guest]: You know, there was again, there was development and innovation in Sanskrit as well.

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:46.920
[Guest]: You know, there's one narrative that, you know, Sanskrit kind of like dies out.

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:48.880
[Guest]: There's nothing much new that's done in it.

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:54.240
[Guest]: But scholars have shown that the 18th century, far from being a kind of a period of darkness

01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:01.160
[Guest]: and dissolution, was really a period of great cultural vibrancy at the time of political

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:05.280
[Guest]: crisis and turmoil also partly perhaps as a result of that.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:12.000
[Guest]: So Persian is one aspect of it, and what I find that, you know, even after the colonial

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.040
[Guest]: government abandons it as an official language and abandons some of its earlier interest

01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:22.320
[Guest]: in Orientalism and producing scholarship on India, they kind of, you know, this is like

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.920
[Guest]: more of the Macaulay influence that we see popping up.

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.200
[Guest]: It doesn't really die.

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:30.920
[Guest]: We have these generations of people who were educated in Persian.

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:34.800
[Guest]: They learned Persian because they also want to get jobs in the colonial administration.

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.800
[Guest]: And then they find it doesn't quite serve them as well.

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.760
[Guest]: But they're producing these books.

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:46.920
[Guest]: And with the growth of the Hindu public sphere, you have a lot of reformists who are translating

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:51.520
[Guest]: these Persian works into Urdu, because now Urdu is what is more commonly understood.

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:58.240
[Guest]: And these languages still don't have the kind of communal charges that they have today.

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:03.360
[Guest]: So again, although there was beginnings of the Urdu-Hindu controversy in the 19th century,

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.920
[Guest]: it doesn't always play out that way.

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.880
[Guest]: You know, in Punjab, for instance, loads of Hindus were learning Urdu, and part of the

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:12.440
[Guest]: education policy meant that Urdu really continued there for a long time.

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:22.080
[Guest]: So we have people who are proto-Arya Samajis, proto kind of part of groups that, the Sanatan

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.080
[Guest]: Dharm groups.

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:27.320
[Guest]: He has debates with each other, and these debates are in a very Persianized register

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.320
[Guest]: of Urdu.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:32.720
[Guest]: And they're debating and talking about things that, you know, we'd really get into trouble

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:37.720
[Guest]: for if we were to debate or talk about these things today, but they're doing that.

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:43.040
[Guest]: There's just reels of really fascinating literature that would otherwise be ignored.

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:48.080
[Amit Varma]: And some of these intellectual currents that you're exploring, is it also driven by what

01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:50.400
[Amit Varma]: is happening in modern times?

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.640
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, both what you're talking about now and the whole Dara Shikoh book is

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:59.200
[Amit Varma]: very resonant with the sort of debates that are taking place today, our different sort

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:02.040
[Amit Varma]: of our ideas of ourselves, so to say.

01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:07.480
[Amit Varma]: So is all of this driven by that and made more, and is that history or the writings

01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:12.600
[Amit Varma]: of that time made more vivid for you because of sort of the world around us?

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:13.600
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:18.880
[Guest]: So I would say that, of course, when I started on this path, we were not in our current political

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.120
[Guest]: scenario at all.

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:25.880
[Guest]: So that wasn't my initial impetus, but you know, definitely how can we are shaped by

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.720
[Guest]: our current times that affects how we view the past.

01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:32.520
[Guest]: So it's, I'd say it's very, very difficult to step out of that.

01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:37.200
[Guest]: You know, there's some more, of course, profound questions that I have that I didn't have when

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.200
[Guest]: I initially started on this path, which is, you know, of course, the ecological catastrophe

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:46.320
[Guest]: in one's thinking of what is really worth studying now, you know, with the Anthropocene,

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:52.640
[Guest]: with this ecological crisis, you know, what should we be doing with our lives?

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:56.560
[Guest]: What kinds of history are worth reading and talking about?

01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:01.920
[Guest]: But I think it's not, you know, apart from the actual topic, I think just the very practice

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:08.000
[Guest]: of reading, critically interrogating, debating, discussing are incredibly important things

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.120
[Guest]: that we need to just keep doing, I'd say.

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:12.600
[Amit Varma]: I can agree with you more.

01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much for coming on the show, Supriya.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.480
[Amit Varma]: It's been a pleasure talking to you.

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:18.880
[Guest]: Thank you so much, Amit.

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:22.720
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoyed listening to this episode, head on over to your nearest bookstore online

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:28.200
[Amit Varma]: or offline, probably online, and pick up The Emperor Who Never Was, Dara Shikoh in Mughal

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:34.520
[Amit Varma]: India by Supriya Gandhi, magnificent storytelling, and it'll give you a much better sense of

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:36.160
[Amit Varma]: the era that it covers.

01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:40.480
[Amit Varma]: Supriya doesn't seem to be on social media, but you can follow me on Twitter at Amit Verma

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:42.920

01:40:51.640 --> 01:41:20.160
[Amit Varma]: What if?

01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:22.640
[Unknown]: What if?

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:23.640
[Unknown]: What if?

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:51.640
[Unknown]: What if?
