00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.740
[Amit Varma]: by putting an end to Article 370.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.860
[Amit Varma]: But what is this argument even?

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.960
[Amit Varma]: The Kashmir issue is at one level a geopolitical dispute between India and Pakistan, and even

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.540
[Amit Varma]: there the nature and incentives and priorities of both sides have changed over the years

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.720
[Amit Varma]: and so has what they have been fighting for.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.380
[Amit Varma]: It is also a moral question about the right of the people of Kashmir to decide their own

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.500
[Amit Varma]: destiny.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.000
[Amit Varma]: But even there nuances exist, and one man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.840
[Amit Varma]: There is also the question of means and ends, where even a nationalist who agrees with India's

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.320
[Amit Varma]: ends may disagree with the means used to get there.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.080
[Amit Varma]: The troubled history of Kashmir definitely does not end here.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.720
[Amit Varma]: All we can do at this moment is take a look back in time and take stock.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.440
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.440
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.160
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.520
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.200
[Amit Varma]: We are recording this on August 16, one day after India celebrated the 72nd anniversary

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.800
[Amit Varma]: of its Independence Day, although Kashmir didn't.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.440
[Amit Varma]: For one thing, Kashmir did not join the Indian Union on August 15, 1947.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.240
[Amit Varma]: For another, the whole state has been in virtual lockdown since Article 370 was done away with

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.240
[Amit Varma]: on August 5th.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.160
[Amit Varma]: There's no doubt that this is a big turning point in our history, not just of Kashmir,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.580
[Amit Varma]: but also of India.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.360
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is a historian Srinath Raghavan, with whom I've done three fascinating episodes

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.760
[Amit Varma]: before, all of which will be linked from the show notes, and all of which are in some way

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.940
[Amit Varma]: or the other germane to our discussion today.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.060
[Amit Varma]: But before I begin my conversation with him, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.200
[Amit Varma]: This episode of the scene and the unseen is brought to you by Storytel.

[Amit Varma]: I actually use Storytel myself regularly.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.800
[Amit Varma]: So as long as they sponsor the show, I'm going to recommend one book a week that I love.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.000
[Amit Varma]: The book I want to recommend today is a book of short stories called Men Without Women

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.280
[Amit Varma]: by Haruki Murakami.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.640
[Amit Varma]: The first time I discovered Murakami, in fact, was when I read a story of his the second

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.560
[Amit Varma]: bakery attack in Playboy in the 1990s.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.640
[Amit Varma]: Yes, that's right.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.000
[Amit Varma]: I read Playboy for the stories.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.160
[Amit Varma]: Men Without Women only on Storytel.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.040
[Amit Varma]: And remember, you get a 30 day free trial only at Storytel.com slash IBM.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.680
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen Srinath.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.680
[Amit Varma]: Good to be back here.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.400
[Amit Varma]: Srinath, in your book, War and Peace in Modern India, you quote Mukul Kesavan near the start

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.360
[Amit Varma]: where he basically says, quote, all postmortems simplify historical choices and thus exaggerate

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.160
[Amit Varma]: the stupidity or insensitivity or wickedness of actors who in retrospect, seem to make

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.880
[Amit Varma]: the wrong ones, stop quote.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.320
[Amit Varma]: And where I found your book interesting, and I wanted to start with the narrative you which

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.480
[Amit Varma]: you've laid out in your book, is that that book is essentially about the choices made

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.840
[Amit Varma]: by India and in particular Nehru, who was a prime minister, examining his worldview

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.800
[Amit Varma]: and his incentives.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.800
[Amit Varma]: And I found it really fascinating.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.960
[Amit Varma]: And that's a good place to begin this because Kashmir is part of the story.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.360
[Amit Varma]: But I think it makes more sense to really begin with Jawaharlal Nehru.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.760
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about how he looked at foreign policy.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.440
[Guest]: Well, of all the leaders in the Indian national movement, you know, in the first half of the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.960
[Guest]: 20th century, I think it's fair to say that Jawaharlal Nehru was possibly the one who

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.500
[Guest]: wanted to understand India's independence movement, its struggle for freedom from British

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.800
[Guest]: colonialism in a wider international context.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.720
[Guest]: And that was something that Nehru, especially from the 1920s onwards, was very keen to understand

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.240
[Guest]: India's struggle for independence as part of a larger sort of movement towards, you

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.760
[Guest]: know, end of colonial empires, self-determination for people, rise of hitherto oppressed sort

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.240
[Guest]: of countries and so on.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.240
[Guest]: Right.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.360
[Guest]: And, and he did this in a series of books, including his autobiography, which has reflections

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.000
[Guest]: of his engagement with the anti-fascist struggles of the 1930s, the anti-imperialist sort of,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.140
[Guest]: you know, discussions happening beyond India in that period.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:55.000
[Guest]: And in that sense, Jawaharlal Nehru was someone who was quite interested in issues of the

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.360
[Guest]: intersection between history and foreign policy in amongst the nationalist leaders.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.860
[Guest]: And it is not surprising, therefore, that he chose to keep the foreign affairs portfolio

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.040
[Guest]: with himself when India first became independent.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.400
[Amit Varma]: And again, I'll quote from your book, and I found these quotes particularly interesting,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.200
[Amit Varma]: and I'll ask you to elaborate where you write, quote, in his understanding of the role of

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.760
[Amit Varma]: force in international relations, Nehru stood at the juncture of the liberal and realist

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.760
[Amit Varma]: traditions.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.920
[Amit Varma]: Like many liberals, he abhorred war for its inherently illiberal effects and consequences,

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.640
[Amit Varma]: and yet maintained that, and now these are his words, in this imperfect world, a national

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.800
[Amit Varma]: state will have to use force to defend itself against unprovoked attack from outside.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800
[Amit Varma]: End of quote.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.000
[Amit Varma]: And again, then you go on to say, by the early 1930s, Nehru's liberal idealism had morphed

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.800
[Amit Varma]: into liberal realism, kind of sort of elaborate on this a little bit.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.600
[Amit Varma]: And also, how did he become a realist when the people around him weren't in a sense?

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.080
[Guest]: Well, it's interesting, right?

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.000
[Guest]: Because these a lot of the debates around the role of coercion in politics is something

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.200
[Guest]: that Nehru has not just with his colleagues in the Congress Party, but with a much wider

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.200
[Guest]: circle.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.680
[Guest]: He writes about these things in his writings in that period, primarily because that is

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.200
[Guest]: a period when the Great Depression is coming on, that is a period when the sort of Spanish

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.920
[Guest]: Civil War has begun, when the role of force both in terms of the relations between classes

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.720
[Guest]: within countries, as well as between states is front and center.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.480
[Guest]: And Nehru wants to acknowledge that this is a reality, that this is not a reality, despite

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.280
[Guest]: India's adherence to Gandhian sort of principles of nonviolence, the fact that means matter

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.320
[Guest]: as much as ends, etc.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.240
[Guest]: He was not willing to sort of give up on the idea that in a world where you do not have

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.080
[Guest]: a world government, where entities are still sovereign, there is actually no limit on the

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.760
[Guest]: use of force as far as states pursuit of what they define to be their national interest

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.920
[Guest]: is concerned.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.840
[Guest]: And in this, interestingly enough, Nehru's ideas, I think, were most strongly shaped

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.320
[Guest]: by the writings of the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.760
[Guest]: And Niebuhr's book, Moral Man, Immoral Society, is something that Nehru read at that point

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.760
[Guest]: of time.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.040
[Guest]: He read that book, and he even quotes from it in his autobiography, you know, and he

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.280
[Guest]: says that there is a fascinating contrast that he makes between Gandhi and Niebuhr.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.440
[Guest]: And in fact, Niebuhr's own book talks about Gandhi, right?

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.440
[Guest]: So these were global debates.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.400
[Guest]: This is not something just happening in India.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.160
[Guest]: The question of violence and nonviolence means and ends were things that I think many people

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.280
[Guest]: in the Indian national movement grappled with it.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.920
[Guest]: And Nehru was particularly keen to grapple with it in the context of India's relationship

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.960
[Guest]: with other countries, not just relations between class, classes within a country, but beyond

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.960
[Guest]: it as well.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.440
[Guest]: And in that sense, Nehru had to reconcile his, on the one hand, what I say as his sort

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.440
[Guest]: of liberal instincts.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.700
[Guest]: And I must say that, you know, Jawaharlal Nehru is not a classical liberal in the straightforward

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.700
[Guest]: sense of the word.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.960
[Guest]: He was much more of a socialist.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.160
[Guest]: But he did believe that individual liberties and constitutionally guaranteed freedoms,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.520
[Guest]: etc., were quite important.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.040
[Guest]: And that societies had to build on it and transcend them, go beyond them, in fact.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.400
[Guest]: So to that extent, he knew that the use of force automatically, in most contexts, meant

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.360
[Guest]: the abridgement of the sort of fundamental rights of other peoples.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.520
[Guest]: But at the same time, he felt that you could not forsake those things ab initio in a way

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.520
[Guest]: that Gandhi wanted to.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.240
[Guest]: In fact, this debate really gets accelerated during the Second World War.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.400
[Guest]: And I think in our episode, the last time we may even have spoken a bit about this,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.680
[Guest]: which is to say that, at the height of the war, you know, in 1940-41, Gandhi wants the

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.940
[Guest]: Congress Party to pass a resolution saying independent India will not have any armed

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.840
[Guest]: forces that we will forswear the use of violence and coercion in existing and rest of the Congress

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.440
[Guest]: leaders led by Jawaharlal Nehru say that, you know, that's just not possible.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.120
[Guest]: We cannot, in the context of what is happening in the world around us, actually assume that.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.000
[Guest]: But at the same time, Nehru is constantly grappling with this Gandhian injunction that

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
[Guest]: means matter as much as sense.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.480
[Guest]: And in that sense, he remains true to that Gandhian tenet and is constantly wrestling

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.480
[Guest]: with it.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.600
[Guest]: And in some ways, the practical choices which had to be made in independent India fell on

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.640
[Guest]: him.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.440
[Guest]: It did not fall on Gandhi, it did not even fall on Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel beyond a

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.560
[Guest]: point nor to any of the other Gandhians and, you know, leaders of the Congress Party.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.200
[Guest]: It fell to Nehru to make these difficult choices in the concrete circumstances of the time.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.680
[Guest]: And it was these choices that I set out to examine in the book that I was writing then.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.720
[Amit Varma]: No, and you mentioned Nehru and you've also sort of quoted Nehru in his autobiography

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.680
[Amit Varma]: where he's talking about Nehru and I'll give Nehru's quote here, which is, quote,

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.880
[Amit Varma]: all life is full of conflict and violence, neither the growth of reason, nor of the religious

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.920
[Amit Varma]: outlook nor morality have checked in any way this tendency to violence, stop quote.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.040
[Amit Varma]: And again, you know, you quote Nehru later talking about nonviolence and placing it in

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:31.640
[Amit Varma]: sort of an instrumental frame, where he says, quote, it could only be a policy and a method

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.200
[Amit Varma]: promising certain results.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.680
[Amit Varma]: And by those results, it would have to be finally judged, which is fairly interesting

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.560
[Amit Varma]: in contrast to Gandhi, obviously, because Gandhi also famously asked the British to

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.560
[Amit Varma]: use nonviolence to fight the Germans and so on and so forth.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.800
[Amit Varma]: And like you said, Nehru sort of had to deal with the practical reality of being prime

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.640
[Amit Varma]: minister, but as you point out that a lot of his thinking was really shaped well before

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.600
[Amit Varma]: he took office, where he was already a liberal realist in a manner of speaking.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.280
[Amit Varma]: And the other sort of thing I kind of noticed is that the key tussle that is happening in

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.680
[Amit Varma]: the early days of the Indian Union when, you know, they're struggling to get all the states

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.760
[Amit Varma]: and they're dealing with Junagadh, Hyderabad, Kashmir, the problem in Bengal and all that

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.580
[Amit Varma]: is that Nehru is also fighting with his own cabinet a lot.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, tell me a bit about that.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.320
[Amit Varma]: Is it simply a matter of position that by virtue of being the guy who makes the final

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.920
[Amit Varma]: decision, the prime minister, he has to be more responsible, and that shapes his behavior?

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.760
[Amit Varma]: Or were there fundamental philosophical differences as well?

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:38.200
[Guest]: Well, you know, once the Indian independence starts coming closer and closer in time, you

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.800
[Guest]: know, the government of India understands that actually the very big problem which they

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.440
[Guest]: had not applied their minds to was this question of what is going to happen to the so called

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.400
[Guest]: princely states, more than 540 of them existed of varying sizes, you know, stuff ranging

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.880
[Guest]: from very small villages to the states of Jammu and Kashmir or Hyderabad, which were

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.120
[Guest]: amongst the richest sort of entities, even in any international comparison.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.560
[Guest]: And in that context, that was an issue which had been left towards the very end, because

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.880
[Guest]: the main issue of partitioning of the two countries of Punjab and Bengal, all of these

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.880
[Guest]: had to be stopped.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.560
[Guest]: And that's where much of the political airtime had been sucked out of.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.120
[Guest]: And so the issue of states had to be done in very fast order.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.440
[Guest]: And it was in that context that, you know, they came up with this idea that, you know,

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.120
[Guest]: you want to have two broad principles to decide how states should make their own choices.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.520
[Guest]: Now, just to sort of wind back a little, the relationship between the princely states and

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.320
[Guest]: the government of India was not one of direct subordination, right?

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.920
[Guest]: They had various forms of treaty arrangements.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.320
[Guest]: And there was a sort of a vague catch all phrase called paramountcy, which was used

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.200
[Guest]: to describe the role of British India vis-a-vis these states, British India is a paramount

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.360
[Guest]: power.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.000
[Guest]: But these states had some varying degrees of autonomy in the way that they organize

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.600
[Guest]: themselves internally, and so on, right?

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.440
[Guest]: So at the time of partition, when you had to decide the problem of princely states,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.600
[Guest]: the way that the solution was come up was to say that states should decide whether they

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:03.560
[Guest]: want to accede to India or to Pakistan, depending broadly on their geographic contiguity, and

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.080
[Guest]: on the sort of nature of the populations, right?

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.320
[Guest]: So if you had a Hindu majority state, and you are smack in the middle of India, you

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:15.000
[Guest]: know, for you to imagine that you're going to go to Pakistan would not be a viable solution.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.160
[Guest]: That was a problem of Hyderabad, right?

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:23.600
[Guest]: Whereas if you were a Muslim majority province, which adjoined Pakistan, then the assumption

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.280
[Guest]: was that you should opt to go to Pakistan, which was a problem of Kashmir.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.440
[Guest]: And then you had something like Junagadh, where there was a Muslim ruler in a broadly

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.920
[Guest]: Hindu populace.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.840
[Guest]: And even though there was not enough geographic contiguity, he was being wooed by them because

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.960
[Guest]: he had access to Karachi by way of a port.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.080
[Guest]: So you know, there are many, many ways in which things could happen.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:48.080
[Guest]: So these three states, particularly Junagadh, Hyderabad, and Kashmir, more or less come

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:53.600
[Guest]: on to the agenda of the government of India, practically on the day of independence itself,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.640
[Guest]: because the Nawab of Junagadh decides to accede to Pakistan.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.120
[Guest]: So his accession has to be turned around, but then he is within his rights to accede.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.080
[Guest]: So the question then becomes how you sort of going to deal with this problem.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.000
[Guest]: The government of India had already been dealing with the Nizam of Hyderabad, who had asked

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.760
[Guest]: for more time to come to some kind of an agreement with the Indian Union.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.440
[Guest]: So that was a problem which is being settled.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.880
[Guest]: And Kashmir, actually, the Maharaja was very unsure.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.560
[Guest]: He was himself a Hindu ruler, but majority of his population was Muslim.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.280
[Guest]: Most of the geographic contiguity at that point of time actually was with Pakistan.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.920
[Guest]: It's something that we tend to forget.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.360
[Guest]: Most of the lines of communication between Kashmir state and British India was actually

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.140
[Guest]: running through parts of Punjab, which later became Pakistan.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.560
[Amit Varma]: And what you also pointed out that at one point when the boundaries were drawn, there

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.320
[Amit Varma]: was no contiguity with India at all.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.960
[Amit Varma]: And later on, Gurdaspur was given to us and that's what there is.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.800
[Guest]: I mean, so those were part of the things, you know, and there is a large historiography,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.840
[Guest]: which basically is one of those retrospective readings, right?

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.800
[Guest]: To say that, oh, this was done in order to facilitate India's sort of, I don't think

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.800
[Guest]: those things hold up.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.160
[Guest]: There are many arguments around those, we don't need to get detained by those.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.640
[Guest]: But I think the point to be made is that these three issues were there.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.660
[Guest]: And it was actually in the context of Junagadh, a state which had Muslim majority.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.360
[Guest]: And let's also not forget, it was Junagadh, you know, is very much part of today's Gujarat.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.240
[Guest]: Vallabhbhai Patel had a personal interest in those areas.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:16.280
[Guest]: And in order to sort of make sure that the accession of Junagadh to Hyderabad was retracted,

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.760
[Guest]: the offer was made that the Indian government would allow for self-determination by way

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.080
[Guest]: of a referendum stroke plebiscite in each of these disputed areas.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.240
[Guest]: It was taken not with respect to Kashmir, but actually first announced with respect

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.560
[Guest]: to Junagadh and said that we are willing to make this applicable as a principle to everything,

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.120
[Guest]: provided Pakistan is willing to sort of adopt the same attitude, right?

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.740
[Guest]: So it is in that context, really, that the issue of a referendum stroke plebiscite happens.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.920
[Guest]: And just to remind our listeners that ultimately Junagadh was annexed by India by force, right?

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.000
[Guest]: The Indian army went in, overthrew the Nawab of Junagadh.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.480
[Guest]: But a referendum was held, which overwhelmingly, quite naturally, went in favor of India.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.520
[Guest]: In the context of Hyderabad, again, India had to use force to sort of take control of

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.520
[Guest]: the state.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.600
[Guest]: But no referendum was held.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.800
[Guest]: What did happen subsequently was that a general election was held and the other thing.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.600
[Guest]: Kashmir was the one where the issue of referendum came to be entangled in a much wider international

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.000
[Guest]: context, which is why we tend to remember.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.760
[Guest]: So we, when we look back, we think there were plebiscite, why only for Kashmir, right?

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.320
[Guest]: Actually, it was not only for Kashmir.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.320
[Guest]: It was the policy of taking a plebiscite was taken on the basis of these things.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.560
[Guest]: And again, as you point out, there were many discussions within the Indian cabinet and

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.720
[Guest]: the defense committee of the cabinet on what is the right measure to do these things.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:39.480
[Guest]: There were disagreements in terms of emphasis between various leaders, not just, you know,

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.840
[Guest]: the fault line was not always between Nehru and Patel, as we today tend to imagine.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.560
[Guest]: There were actually many other cabinet ministers who had a say.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.080
[Guest]: Lord Mountbatten played a fairly important role in these discussions as governor general

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.360
[Guest]: and as chair of the defense committee of the cabinet.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.360
[Guest]: So it was a much more open set of discussions in which I don't think the fault lines ran

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.960
[Guest]: just between Patel and Nehru.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.960
[Guest]: Actually it did not.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.480
[Guest]: On some of the more core issues, they agreed with each other.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.080
[Guest]: On other issues, they did not.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.200
[Guest]: But these were discussed as they would be discussed in any cabinet meeting where you

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.720
[Guest]: have a first amongst equals kind of position for the prime minister.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.480
[Guest]: And decisions were arrived at by consensus.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:17.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, just to sort of go back to 47 itself, and the thing is, when paramouncy ended, there

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.440
[Amit Varma]: was even a dispute about whether the princely states could go for independence, where India,

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.800
[Amit Varma]: as you pointed out, they feared a balkanization that, you know, too many people will claim

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.800
[Amit Varma]: independence.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.040
[Amit Varma]: So they said, no, they have to join one or the other.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.520
[Amit Varma]: And on the other hand, Jinnah was saying, no, no, they can go independent if they want,

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.840
[Amit Varma]: because he wants to mess with India, obviously, and it's, you know, advantages for him from

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.920
[Amit Varma]: a strategic point of view for to encourage independence, as in fact, he did in the case

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.200
[Amit Varma]: of Hyderabad and, and even Junagadh, I think that Junagadh acceded to Pakistan formally.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.200
[Amit Varma]: At that point, yeah.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.440
[Amit Varma]: And Shahnawaz Bhutto went and then kind of took over and all that.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.840
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about what exactly happened in Junagadh then, because these decisions

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:02.200
[Amit Varma]: really also then impact what eventually happens in Kashmir after that.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.360
[Guest]: So as I said, I mean, in the case of Junagadh, as you're pointing out, basically, the Pakistani

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.920
[Guest]: secured attempted to secure the accession of the state.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:17.160
[Guest]: And it then fell upon India to sort of persuade the Nawab of Junagadh to roll back.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.320
[Guest]: And there were attempts made to sort of suggest to him that, you know, this was not something

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.480
[Guest]: which was a viable proposition.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.240
[Guest]: Junagadh state itself was embedded in a number of other states in Saurashtra.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.240
[Guest]: You know, it was a very fragmented kind of, it is a mosaic, literally.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.760
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at the map of the princely states of Saurashtra back then, it's literally

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.840
[Guest]: like a mosaic and Junagadh is there.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.320
[Guest]: But you know, what happens in Junagadh has consequences for other adjoining provinces,

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.880
[Guest]: many of whom were not desirous of joining Pakistan.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.920
[Guest]: And as I said, Junagadh being part of what we would today call Gujarat have meant that

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.240
[Guest]: there was a strong sort of nationalist element involved, Patel himself was very closely sort

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.160
[Guest]: of interested in as incidentally was Gandhi, yeah, Gandhi came from Kadiabad.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.920
[Guest]: And you know, and one of his Gandhi's nephews, a man called Samal Das Gandhi, Samal Das Gandhi

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.360
[Guest]: was the one who was leading the so called provisional government of Junagadh, which

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.840
[Guest]: sort of Darzi hukumat, which was set up to contest the legitimacy of the Nawab.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.720
[Amit Varma]: Which Pakistan claimed was India's people and India said, No, we had nothing to do with

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.720
[Guest]: these guys.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.400
[Guest]: So it is one of those kinds of situations, right.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.320
[Guest]: And so the Indians effectively then had to, you know, to put no finer point on it, use

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.040
[Guest]: military force to annex Junagadh.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.320
[Guest]: And a similar sort of move was made with respect to Hyderabad.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.000
[Guest]: Now, the point to remember is that at this point of time, the most important consideration

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.080
[Guest]: for the government of India was to secure the unity of India in the aftermath of partition.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.620
[Guest]: And that was a overriding consideration.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.600
[Guest]: And that overriding consideration in some ways also fed into the constitutional vision

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.160
[Guest]: for independent India itself.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.920
[Guest]: The constitution of India envisages the Indian Union as a unitary state, it does not envisage

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.920
[Guest]: it as a federal state.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.920
[Guest]: Right.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.400
[Guest]: And there was a good reason because they did not want to give any kind of sovereign powers

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.760
[Guest]: even to federating units, even in a sort of hypothetical sense.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.720
[Guest]: They wanted to make sure that this remains a unitary.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:02.280
[Guest]: So the maintaining the unity of the country was not just a ideological project in a sense

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:07.960
[Guest]: of all nationhoods wanting a homeland to be unified, but was a practical necessity.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.520
[Guest]: Because Indians believe that if you let go of, if Hyderabad could sort of claim independence

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.320
[Guest]: sitting in the middle of India or Junagadh could do something, then everybody else is

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.320
[Guest]: going to be emboldened to make similar kinds of claims, which would then weaken the Union

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.480
[Guest]: of India itself.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:27.080
[Guest]: And we must understand that the Congress Party and the rest of the Indian nationalist movement

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.080
[Guest]: had rejected the cabinet mission plan, which actually called for a confederation kind of

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.920
[Guest]: solution between India and Pakistan with a very weak center.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:39.280
[Guest]: They wanted a strong center, because you believe that until India had a strong central government,

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.680
[Guest]: development would suffer, that we needed to sort of really push these things through.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.400
[Guest]: So there were many reasons for a unitary, strong centralized state being the desired

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.460
[Guest]: outcome.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.200
[Guest]: And having actually accepted partition to get that, they were in no mood to allow the

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.280
[Guest]: princely states to wreck the party.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.600
[Amit Varma]: So essentially what happened and we obviously got our constitution in Jan 1950.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.640
[Amit Varma]: In 1947, what happened was there was something called the Indian Independence Act, which

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.560
[Amit Varma]: empowered the Governor General of India, which was then Mountbatten to adapt the Government

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:12.800
[Amit Varma]: of India Act of 1935, as an interim constitution, and then to negotiate with each of the princely

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.120
[Amit Varma]: states to get them to accede.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.800
[Amit Varma]: In the end, it turns out Kashmir was the only one which really negotiated.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, the rest sort of happened through other means in the case of Junagadh and Hyderabad,

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.260
[Amit Varma]: as you point out, virtually through, I mean, we just sent our army there and basically

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.560
[Amit Varma]: took over.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:34.000
[Amit Varma]: But with Kashmir, on the other hand, there was an instrument of accession signed on October

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.280
[Amit Varma]: 26, 1947, which also pointed out that this was provisional until the will of the people

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.220
[Amit Varma]: was ascertained.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.600
[Amit Varma]: What was the politics that was playing out during this time between India and Pakistan

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:53.080
[Amit Varma]: and you know, the Maharaja of Kashmir, Hari Singh, and Sheikh Abdullah, who was at that

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.320
[Amit Varma]: time, head of the National Conference?

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.600
[Guest]: So I think there are two or three issues that, you know, I think we just need to separate

00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.600
[Guest]: out.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.200
[Guest]: The first point, just a preliminary one in response to what you said earlier, you know,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.720
[Guest]: as far as Hyderabad is concerned, actually, there were very prolonged negotiations running

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.680
[Guest]: for almost 10 months.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.720
[Guest]: You know, I think actually with Hyderabad, you had the longest sets of negotiations.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.880
[Guest]: It's only when those negotiations failed, that India decided to use force, right?

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.960
[Guest]: So whereas with Junagadh, the use of force was much quicker, it happened in much shorter

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:19.960
[Guest]: order.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.800
[Guest]: So that's just to sort of put that point there.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.800
[Guest]: Leaving that aside, right?

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.600
[Guest]: Now, the instrument of accession itself was a legal instrument, which was devised by VP

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.720
[Guest]: Menon, who was the Secretary of the Ministry of States and the person who worked most closely

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.320
[Guest]: with the Minister of State, which was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, to gain accession.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:41.440
[Guest]: And what Menon and Patel, and of course, the rest of government of India after consultations,

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.720
[Guest]: decided was that instead of trying to get into protracted negotiations between with

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.000
[Guest]: each of the states about what their exact relationship with the Indian Union is going

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.640
[Guest]: to be, the first thing is to secure their addition to the Union on minimal terms.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.680
[Guest]: And then we can figure out things later about what we want to do.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.320
[Guest]: So the instrument of accession, therefore, was a modified instrument actually from the

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.040
[Guest]: Government of India Act.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:07.240
[Guest]: And they just used it to say, sign up with us for just giving us control over three subjects,

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.880
[Guest]: defence, foreign affairs and communications, I mean, road, whatever, telephone, telegraphic

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.920
[Guest]: communications and so on.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.720
[Guest]: And that for the rest, the states have all the residual powers, the rest with the states

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.980
[Guest]: themselves, right?

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:23.200
[Guest]: And then over a period of time, many other states were persuaded to accept all provisions

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.360
[Guest]: of the Constitution and merge effectively with the Indian Union.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.000
[Guest]: Others like Hyderabad, which resisted even instrument of accession, were then sort of

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.120
[Guest]: brought to heel by the use of force.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.120
[Guest]: With Kashmir, as you're saying, at the time when the instrument of accession was signed,

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.680
[Guest]: the Government of India, Lord Mountbatten on behalf of as Governor General also announced

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.920
[Guest]: that a, the wishes of the people will be sort of ascertained ultimately about the future

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.920
[Guest]: of Kashmir.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.820
[Guest]: Kashmir, as I said, was a pledge which had originally been made with respect to all the

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.920
[Guest]: outstanding problems and was not something which was specially crafted for Kashmir.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.160
[Guest]: But it was something that was announced at that point of time that this is something

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.000
[Guest]: that India is committed to doing, which is to give the people of Kashmir a chance to

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.400
[Guest]: determine their own wishes about whether they want to be with India or to be with Pakistan.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of the interesting themes through your book was Nehru's reluctance to

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.240
[Amit Varma]: use violence at any point because he sensibly realized that the unintended consequences

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.240
[Amit Varma]: are harsh.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.240
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps, you know, perhaps after seeing what happened during partition and the communal

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:28.440
[Amit Varma]: violence that broke out, he also had a fear that any use of violence by the state in any,

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, whether it's in Hyderabad or whether it's in Junagadh or Kashmir or whatever, could

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:39.080
[Amit Varma]: have subsequent repercussions in the rest of the country and end up in communal violence.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:44.800
[Amit Varma]: And what's interesting to me with the context of Hyderabad was that Nehru essentially took

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.120
[Amit Varma]: a hands-off approach and didn't really want to use violence, just wanted to negotiate

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.700
[Amit Varma]: his way to a settlement.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:54.920
[Amit Varma]: But his hand was forced by the violence used by the Razakars, right, which were the sort

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.200
[Amit Varma]: of the militant wing of the fundamentalist party out there.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:04.760
[Amit Varma]: And ultimately, you know, the Razakars just sort of carried out so many attacks and so

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.580
[Amit Varma]: much violence that Nehru's hand was forced.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.600
[Amit Varma]: The interesting counterfactual here is what happens if the Razakars don't carry out all

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.680
[Amit Varma]: of that violence and Hyderabad nevertheless refuses to accede to the Indian Union, where

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.080
[Amit Varma]: do you think that would have gone?

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.160
[Guest]: Well, it's an interesting counterfactual question.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:28.080
[Guest]: And I think the answer will turn on what we think the Nizam of Hyderabad was willing or

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.320
[Guest]: not willing to do irrespective of the Razakar violence.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:36.520
[Guest]: And it is a fact that the Nizam of Hyderabad was staking out for a very maximalist position,

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.520
[Guest]: right?

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.400
[Guest]: He wanted some kind of a agreement between India and this thing and an agreement of that

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.000
[Guest]: kind would be effectively an agreement under international law of the kind say that India

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.360
[Guest]: signed with states like Sikkim, right, which was until 1975, not part of the Indian Union.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.880
[Guest]: And he in fact, also wanted access to have a land corridor leading up to a port on Western

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.700
[Guest]: India and so on and so forth, right?

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.260
[Guest]: And he had fairly grandized plans and was quite unrealistic.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.880
[Guest]: So my sense is that even if the Razakar violence had not happened, I do not think it would

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.400
[Guest]: have been possible to come to any kind of an agreement which would have satisfied both

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.240
[Guest]: sides very easily.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.360
[Guest]: And even without the Razakar violence, I think the government of India would eventually have

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.640
[Guest]: had to use force, if that's what it came down to.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:26.040
[Guest]: What the Razakar issue did was to give them a justification, which was quite convenient

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.720
[Guest]: to explain why their action had to take place and they explained it as a breakdown of sort

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.520
[Guest]: of law and order, which there was to be fair.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:39.040
[Guest]: But that that could do it so so I don't think the Hyderabad issue would have led to a non

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.960
[Guest]: violent solution, simply because I think the expectations of the Nizam and those of the

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.960
[Guest]: government of India were too wide apart to be able to bridge by mutual concessions of

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.000
[Amit Varma]: various kinds.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.160
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, but it strikes me that like you point out, if Nehru is unwilling to actually

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.840
[Amit Varma]: invade to use that term or actually unwilling to send his forces in, then even if there

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:05.400
[Amit Varma]: is disagreement, you know, what are the other sort of arrangements that could possibly emerge

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.400
[Amit Varma]: out of that?

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.120
[Guest]: No, but I think Nehru himself would have sort of eventually agreed to sort of use force

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.780
[Guest]: because, because in many other contexts, you know, the reality is that these were discussions

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.280
[Guest]: which were made by the cabinet, right?

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.600
[Guest]: And again, I'd like to emphasize that, you know, in retrospect, we think of that period

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.000
[Guest]: as being sort of dominated by Jawaharlal Nehru.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.400
[Guest]: But the reality was that he was first among equals, which was his envisage position.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.360
[Guest]: You know, they were very stalwart leaders in the Congress Party and members of cabinet

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.360
[Guest]: people who are there.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.800
[Guest]: And all of these decisions were taken in cabinet consensus.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.600
[Guest]: I mean, just to give you one example of something which has again become something of interest

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.600
[Guest]: in the current context.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.760
[Guest]: You know, at that point of time, the first cabinet of India, Samar Prasad Mukherjee,

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.800
[Guest]: who later on founded the Jansangh was a member of the cabinet.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.400
[Guest]: And you know, Mukherjee, of course, later on sort of opposed the fact that, you know,

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.080
[Guest]: India's handling over the Kashmir issue was something he wanted the abrogation of 370.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.400
[Amit Varma]: That is one of the sort of facts.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.400
[Amit Varma]: He died in a jail in Srinagar.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.400
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.400
[Guest]: Right.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.080
[Guest]: So, so he was sort of he's seen as a martyr to that cause, etc.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.080
[Guest]: Now, but in one of the parliamentary debates, which happened after Mukherjee had turned

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.720
[Guest]: against all of this stuff.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.600
[Guest]: Somebody asked him saying, you know, weren't you in the cabinet when the decision was taken

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.840
[Guest]: to take this issue to the UN?

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.600
[Guest]: Mukherjee said, yes, I was.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.720
[Guest]: And I don't want to get into a discussion about what happened and why we chose that,

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.480
[Guest]: which only goes to tell you that, you know, the reality was that these were collective

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.840
[Guest]: decisions which were being taken.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.120
[Guest]: Of course, Jawaharlal Nehru as Prime Minister had this thing.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.520
[Guest]: As I said, when it came to the issue of states, Sardar Patel had an important role to play.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.840
[Guest]: Lord Mountbatten still had an important role to play.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.880
[Guest]: As did many other leaders and, you know, Gopalaswamy Iyengar, for instance, on Kashmir had an important

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.160
[Guest]: role to play.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:40.440
[Guest]: So, in the context of Hyderabad, therefore, I think Nehru's hand would have been forced

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.680
[Guest]: one way or the other.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.440
[Guest]: But as you're saying, he was very reluctant and primarily so in the context of the violence

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.920
[Guest]: of partition, which is something again, I think we need to bear in mind when we think

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.200
[Guest]: about the context of some of those decisions to be taken, right?

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:58.240
[Guest]: One of the constant things which, you know, even today Nehru is criticized for, you know,

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.480
[Guest]: is to say that why did he take the issue to the UN, right?

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.820
[Guest]: As if it was a suo moto decision by Jawaharlal Nehru to take it.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:11.160
[Guest]: But the reality was that by the third week of December 1947, it had become clear to India

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.560
[Guest]: that the only way to evict the raiders who had come into Kashmir and they managed to

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.080
[Guest]: hold them, push them back, but to totally sort of stop them was to attack their bases

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.560
[Guest]: which were in Punjab, in Pakistani side of Punjab.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:28.880
[Guest]: And given the nature of communications between India and JNK, the quantum of force that you

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.120
[Guest]: needed to use was best possible if you attack from our Punjab into their Punjab, which would

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:39.200
[Guest]: have meant a declaration of war on Pakistan or a crossing of the international border.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.760
[Guest]: And given that Punjab was the theater where maximum amount of violence happened in the

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.200
[Guest]: context of partition, you know, the numbers are still disputed, maybe a million people

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.560
[Guest]: died, many more millions were displaced.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.000
[Guest]: That seemed like an option which nobody could countenance.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.480
[Guest]: And the reality was that no political leader at that point of time felt that that was such

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.080
[Guest]: a great option to exercise.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.440
[Guest]: So then the question became, what is the lesser evil, which is the other alternative that

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.600
[Guest]: we can look at?

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.540
[Guest]: It is in that context, after a lot of deliberation that they came to a conclusion that going

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:10.080
[Guest]: to the United Nations might be the least of the possible sort of, you know, evils, simply

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.460
[Guest]: because any other alternative would be much worse.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.320
[Guest]: And Nehru was also concerned that if India got into a war with Pakistan at this point

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:21.600
[Guest]: of time, it would effectively give a signal for Hindu communal elements in this country

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.800
[Guest]: to turn on their Muslim compatriots, right?

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.160
[Guest]: Let's remember the context of partition, right?

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.880
[Guest]: I mean, there is this whole argument in India that India should become Hindustan, that these

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.660
[Guest]: guys have got their Pakistan, so why shouldn't this become Hindustan, right?

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:38.320
[Guest]: And it is that the Jawaharlal Nehru was very, very desirous of preventing.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:43.180
[Guest]: And let us also remember that those concerns were by no means unfounded.

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:48.460
[Guest]: After the Indian army moved into Hyderabad, there was a massacre of Muslims of Hyderabad

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.880
[Guest]: state by Hindus in the same state.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.760
[Guest]: There is a report by Pandit Sundarlal, an independent committee, which went in, that

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.720
[Guest]: report was suppressed for many years, which says that perhaps maybe 40,000 people died

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.200
[Guest]: in that violence, 40,000.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.840
[Guest]: And you have to just understand that we are talking about an extraordinarily combustible

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.800
[Guest]: political situation, communal situation in this country.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.600
[Guest]: That is the context in which these discussions are happening.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.540
[Guest]: So which is why, you know, I begin with that quote with Mukul Kesavan in my book.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:19.680
[Guest]: Because when we look back, all we see is this standalone decision of going to the UN, which

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.160
[Guest]: has become an albatross on India's neck for the subsequent history.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.700
[Guest]: But why did we get there?

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.640
[Guest]: Because their concerns were many more.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.600
[Guest]: They did not think that this was going to be the main problem.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.040
[Guest]: Their problem was to ensure that the country just did not explode into another paroxysm

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.040
[Amit Varma]: of violence.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.560
[Amit Varma]: And what was happening was, it wasn't just as if there was one Kashmir issued simultaneously,

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.240
[Amit Varma]: Junagadh is happening, Hyderabad is happening.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.480
[Amit Varma]: And as you've, you know, described in your book, Nehru was shocked by what happened in

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:51.040
[Amit Varma]: Hyderabad later, because his calculation was that we use force as late as possible only

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.160
[Amit Varma]: if pushed into it, because there is a danger of Muslims in the rest of the country being

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.840
[Amit Varma]: killed by, you know, Hindu fundamentalists.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.160
[Amit Varma]: And what he didn't envisage, perhaps within Hyderabad, where at that point in time, it

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.600
[Amit Varma]: was the Muslims who were attacking Hindus with the Razakars and all that.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.800
[Amit Varma]: That's exactly what would happen in Hyderabad, that Muslims would die in large numbers.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.000
[Amit Varma]: A couple of thoughts strike me here.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.440
[Amit Varma]: One is when you know, when I was reading your book, it struck me that the dilemma that Nehru

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:22.040
[Amit Varma]: faced with regards to hitting the bases of the raiders who came into Kashmir is actually

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.520
[Amit Varma]: the exact same one Modi has faced in his five years.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:30.080
[Amit Varma]: Because all our cross border terrorism, basically the bases are all in Pakistan.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.360
[Amit Varma]: And even Modi has made basically the same decision that Nehru made then, that no, there

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.880
[Amit Varma]: is no point starting a war, it's a negative sum game and we will suffer too much, which

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.280
[Amit Varma]: is a sensible decision.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.400
[Amit Varma]: And again, perhaps it is the fact that you are Prime Minister and you're in that position

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:48.100
[Amit Varma]: of responsibility that you have to make that decision not to go to war.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:53.520
[Amit Varma]: But it seems to me that Modi has made exactly the same decision now, as sort of Nehru did

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.520
[Amit Varma]: then.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.960
[Amit Varma]: And the other interesting point that I think people often don't realize now, now that we

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.600
[Amit Varma]: take the diversity of India for granted, and we take Pakistan for granted being what it

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:08.960
[Amit Varma]: is, is that at that point in time, the two nation theory was very much a life question.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:14.060
[Amit Varma]: So you know, Nehru had to keep into account that, like, for example, at one point in your

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:19.880
[Amit Varma]: book, you mentioned about how, when, you know, the mechanics of a plebiscite in Kashmir were

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.240
[Amit Varma]: being discussed.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.020
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, there were many different versions of it.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:29.640
[Amit Varma]: But one version that Pakistan said was that as far as the Poonch regions or the Azad Kashmir

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.160
[Amit Varma]: regions are concerned, we don't need to do a plebiscite, we'll just go by religious composition,

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:38.160
[Amit Varma]: which immediately Nehru discarded out of hand, because that is a confirmation of the two

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.160
[Amit Varma]: nation theory.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.160
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.840
[Guest]: I think what you did not want to do was to take any step which further legitimize this

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:49.120
[Guest]: claim that just because Pakistan has been created on as a homeland for the Muslims of

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:53.080
[Guest]: the subcontinent, so to speak, that was the demand that you know, those principles could

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:57.480
[Guest]: be applied to smaller and smaller pieces of territory, which were under contention.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.320
[Guest]: And I think that was something that and Nehru says that quite openly, which I think is part

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.040
[Guest]: of the reason why, you know, there are the Indian political right, especially of the

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:09.680
[Guest]: Hindu right, you know, detest Jawaharlal Nehru with this kind of virulence is because Nehru

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.800
[Guest]: and he says it openly, he says that I am not going to allow India to become a Hindu Pakistan,

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.800
[Guest]: right?

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.880
[Guest]: This is going to be an India where people of all religions can live and can live safely.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:24.080
[Guest]: And you know, it was a pledge, which I think he tried to stand true to for the rest of

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.080
[Amit Varma]: his life.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:29.800
[Amit Varma]: And the reason I've sort of, you know, spoken about, you know, this is ostensibly an episode

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.800
[Amit Varma]: about Kashmir.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.920
[Amit Varma]: But I've also asked you about Junagadh and Hyderabad and so on, is that one thing I realized

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.760
[Amit Varma]: in your book is that a lot of the decisions, a lot of the dynamics around Kashmir between

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:43.120
[Amit Varma]: India and Pakistan and so on, are very much impacted by what was happening in Junagadh

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.880
[Amit Varma]: and Hyderabad, because it was simultaneous and even later in Bengal, which we've forgotten

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.280
[Amit Varma]: because, you know, the Junagadh problem is solved, there's nothing there, Hyderabad is

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.680
[Amit Varma]: solved, they are nicely parts of India.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:57.440
[Amit Varma]: The fact that there was a plebiscite in Junagadh, the fact that, you know, Nehru and his cabinet

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.200
[Amit Varma]: were fighting a battle on all these different fronts, and it was by no means something they

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.520
[Amit Varma]: could take for granted that the India that we know on the map today will actually be

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.520
[Amit Varma]: what it is.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, everything was up for grabs, it could all have fallen apart in a moment.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:16.040
[Amit Varma]: How did those particular battles of Junagadh and Hyderabad affect India's thinking on Kashmir?

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:21.920
[Guest]: Well, I think they affected it in the sense that they committed India to a certain position

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:29.600
[Guest]: about the right to self determination of peoples of these places, rather than assuming that

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.320
[Guest]: simple religious composition should sort of settle the issue once and for all, right.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.560
[Guest]: So in that sense, I think there was a thing.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.840
[Guest]: As I said, in the context of Junagadh, India held a referendum after the Indian Army went

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:40.840
[Guest]: in.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.120
[Guest]: In the context of Hyderabad, it did not.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:47.920
[Guest]: And in the context of Kashmir, it affirmed at the time of the accession that a referendum

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.120
[Guest]: will be held when conditions are suitable conditions are established.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.560
[Guest]: And the Indian position subsequently was that suitable conditions have not been established

00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:00.280
[Guest]: because of the continued Pakistani occupation, military occupation of a portion of the state

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.280
[Guest]: of Jammu and Kashmir.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.520
[Guest]: Now, I think it's also fair to point out that as the Kashmir issue sort of developed from

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:13.080
[Guest]: 48 onwards, the Indian government's own thinking on the advisability of a plebiscite changed,

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.080
[Guest]: right.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.080
[Guest]: And they changed for a couple of reasons.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.900
[Guest]: The first, as I said, was that there was an official position that there were the conditions

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:22.920
[Guest]: for holding a free and fair plebiscite would not be obtained so long as the Pakistan Army

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.880
[Guest]: was in occupation of certain parts of the thing.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:32.000
[Guest]: The second reason was that the Indians themselves were unsure whether Sheikh Abdullah, the person

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.760
[Guest]: who had sort of, you know, committed on behalf of the Kashmiri Muslims that yes, we support

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:42.520
[Guest]: the accession to India would actually be able to prevail upon his own people to ratify the

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.760
[Guest]: decision in a subsequent plebiscite.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.240
[Guest]: Because let's face it, there's another incident which happened, which again, we tend to forget,

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:54.800
[Guest]: which is that around the time of partition, and in 1947, there was an extraordinary sort

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:59.080
[Guest]: of communal violence which took place in the Jammu province of the J&K state.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:05.320
[Guest]: And there, Jammu was actually in 1947, again, sounds ironic today, a Muslim majority province

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.040
[Guest]: in terms of population.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.560
[Guest]: And there was huge ethnic cleansing of Muslims.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:13.000
[Guest]: And many of them left for Pakistan and the Punjab.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.600
[Guest]: And that violence and what happened in Jammu also had an impact on the Muslims of the valley,

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.200
[Guest]: because they were unsure what is going to happen to them, would they be reduced to a

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.000
[Guest]: minority status and so on, right?

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.800
[Guest]: So all these fears in the minds of people about whether joining India was actually the

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.360
[Guest]: wise decision.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:34.560
[Guest]: And all your bets hinged on Sheikh Abdullah being able to prevail upon the Kashmiri people

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:39.880
[Guest]: that joining a secular India is actually the best thing for the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:44.720
[Guest]: And the third thing is that already by the summer of 1948, even before the ceasefire is

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:50.680
[Guest]: announced in Kashmir, both Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel come to a conclusion that

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.860
[Guest]: maybe the best solution for this is simply to partition the state along the existing

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.800
[Guest]: sort of line where the two armies are fighting each other, which is broadly, you may call

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.880
[Guest]: it the ceasefire line, later line of control, etc, right?

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.400
[Guest]: So and this is something which is true of even Sardar Patel.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:11.720
[Guest]: Sardar Patel tells the British sort of High Commissioner to India in June 1948, that the

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.120
[Guest]: best solution to this problem is just to settle it on the status quo.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.080
[Guest]: That I think was something that actually the Indians were prepared for, the Pakistanis

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.560
[Guest]: were never acceptable to that.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.080
[Guest]: Liaquat Ali Khan shot it down entirely.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:26.280
[Guest]: He said, nothing, Kashmir banega Pakistan, remained their slogan, and that was put on

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.280
[Guest]: the storage, right?

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.720
[Guest]: So which is why when today, people keep insisting that if Patel had a free hand, you know, the

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.160
[Guest]: entire state would have been reconquered, it is just fantasy.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.760
[Guest]: It does not even accord with the facts of the situation, which were that at that point

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:42.760
[Guest]: of time, both Nehru and Patel were actually aligned on the idea that we should go for

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.960
[Guest]: a partition of the state, Nehru even proposed it informally to Liaquat Ali Khan only to

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.960
[Amit Varma]: be shot down.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.040
[Amit Varma]: And just to sort of go back into the historical events, and a little before that, obviously,

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.640
[Amit Varma]: when, you know, both the nations became independent at that time, you know, Jinnah famously believed

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:01.440
[Amit Varma]: that, quote, Kashmir will fall into a lap, like a ripe fruit, stop code.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.920
[Amit Varma]: And that makes sense, because there was geographic contiguity, the religious composition, the

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.360
[Amit Varma]: fact that it was Muslim majority, all of it.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.600
[Amit Varma]: And at that point, there was no contiguity with India, either, Gurdaspur was kind of

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.600
[Amit Varma]: given later.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.400
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, that contiguity was there.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:20.080
[Amit Varma]: And there is this interesting contrast there, where with Junagadh and Hyderabad, you have

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.280
[Amit Varma]: Hindu majority people, but you have Muslim rulers.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.160
[Amit Varma]: And India is taking the position there that was the will of the people has to matter.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:32.960
[Amit Varma]: But in Kashmir, you have a Hindu ruler, and you have a Muslim majority state, had they

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:39.320
[Amit Varma]: allowed the Hindu ruler to accede to India, number one, and number two, after so and then,

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:43.920
[Amit Varma]: obviously, Pakistan, which doesn't really its army is not in a terribly good state,

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:48.600
[Amit Varma]: as you point out, but they send these tribals and they take over what is Azad Kashmir, Poonch

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:52.240
[Amit Varma]: and Gilgit and all of that, and they hold that bit.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:58.120
[Amit Varma]: And at that point, whenever the UN or anybody else proposes that both the armies have to

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:03.080
[Amit Varma]: withdraw, both the forces have to withdraw, Nehru claims that there is absolutely no equivalence,

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:07.320
[Amit Varma]: because hey, you know, it belongs to us, Hari Singh has acceded.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:13.080
[Amit Varma]: So how does one then explain this sort of conflict of principles that were, you know,

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.400
[Amit Varma]: in Junagadh and Hyderabad, you're saying Hindu majority people, they have to decide.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.080
[Amit Varma]: But here you're saying, no, it doesn't matter what the majority is, the prince has acceded

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.080
[Amit Varma]: to us.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.080
[Guest]: And that's what matters.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.080
[Guest]: You know, actually speaking, that was not the position, because when the tribal invasion

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:30.760
[Guest]: first began, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, Hari Singh, very quickly proposed to India

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.900
[Guest]: that, you know, the state should accede to India, because you know, he said that can

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.400
[Guest]: India actually sort of offer us protection.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.480
[Guest]: And the discussion in the first cabinet meeting, when that happened, was that we should secure

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.480
[Guest]: accession before we do that.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.920
[Guest]: Because then we are within our rights to send troops to any part of territory which belongs

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.080
[Guest]: to India.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.720
[Guest]: And in that meeting, it is Jawaharlal Nehru who actually says that the question of accession

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.440
[Guest]: is actually immaterial in this context, we are all talking legalities, what matters is

00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:01.800
[Guest]: whether we can be sure that the people of Kashmir will be with us, that they want this.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:06.400
[Guest]: And that in order to secure that, we have to get Sheikh Abdullah to sort of actually

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.220
[Guest]: give his imprimatur to this instrument of accession.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:14.960
[Guest]: So unless and until Sheikh Abdullah is brought in to the government of Kashmir by the Maharaja,

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.920
[Guest]: and he sort of agrees that this is the way to go forward, frankly, we are going to be

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.200
[Guest]: building a castle of sand, because it is going to be washed away by the tide.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.000
[Guest]: Because if we can't rely on the support of the people, there is no way that we can hold

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.520
[Amit Varma]: on to a Muslim majority province.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.400
[Amit Varma]: And how is Sheikh Abdullah in charge of the government there?

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.400
[Guest]: No, he was not.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.400
[Guest]: He was in prison at that point of time.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.080
[Guest]: So they brought him out and they put him in charge.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.960
[Guest]: So you know, he was someone who was at loggerheads with the Maharaja.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.280
[Guest]: So it is at Jawaharlal Nehru and the Indian Nationalists insistence that Abdullah is then

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.960
[Guest]: sort of brought in to this, you know, government which is constituted by the Maharaja.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.480
[Guest]: And you know, it is in that context that Indians finally agree to accept the instrument of

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.640
[Guest]: accession and send the troops in.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:58.200
[Guest]: So I think the initial instincts were absolutely correct, which is that you needed this to

00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.200
[Guest]: happen.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.480
[Guest]: The problem was twofold.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:06.440
[Guest]: As I said, one was that once the Pakistanis came to control a certain part of that territory,

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:10.600
[Guest]: then the question became whether we should have a plebiscite even while Pakistan is controlling

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:16.400
[Guest]: any of those things, and whether we can actually sort of expect anybody to, you know, impartially

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.560
[Guest]: sort of overlook or see such a plebiscite.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:24.040
[Guest]: And the UN debates in 1948 convinced India that the great powers were playing politics

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.040
[Guest]: there.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.040
[Guest]: They were taking very partisan positions.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:30.060
[Guest]: And ergo, you could not really expect a impartial plebiscite to happen.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.120
[Guest]: And this issue would simply be decided that, oh, these are Muslims, they should go to Pakistan.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.120
[Guest]: Right?

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.360
[Guest]: This is the principle that, you know, things would be legitimized.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.680
[Guest]: So which is why the option of a plebiscite is something that the Indians start backing

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.680
[Unknown]: off from.

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.680
[Guest]: Even Jawaharlal Nehru starts backing off from it.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.520
[Guest]: I think we should face up to the facts.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.080
[Guest]: Whatever the official position, which is that Pakistani military presence prevents this.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.900
[Guest]: The reality is that the Indians themselves are not sure of the wisdom of going ahead

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:57.160
[Guest]: with a plebiscite in the context of those things happening.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.160
[Guest]: Right?

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:02.040
[Guest]: And Sheikh Abdullah initially feels quite happy that yes, we know we should sort of,

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.920
[Guest]: you know, a plebiscite will go in India's favor.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.360
[Guest]: But over a period of time, even he starts having doubts as this issue sort of continues

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.360
[Guest]: to simmer.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.720
[Guest]: So there is a genuine concern about whether a plebiscite is going to work in your favor

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.720
[Guest]: or not.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:18.760
[Guest]: Now, when you have that situation, it is in that context that the Indians then start thinking

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:24.160
[Guest]: about what are the alternatives to a plebiscite, which will still allow for a degree of self-determination

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.160
[Guest]: to happen.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.720
[Guest]: Because what they have pledged is that the Kashmiris will take a stand on their own.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:34.040
[Guest]: And it is in that context that actually they invite Sheikh Abdullah to come and join the

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:38.920
[Guest]: Indian Constituent Assembly and say that we will give you enough provisions for autonomy

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:43.840
[Guest]: and give you in a position where your state's constitution, decided by your Constituent

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:50.080
[Guest]: Assembly, which is a JNK Constituent Assembly, will decide how much of India's constitution

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.280
[Guest]: you will accept.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:55.280
[Guest]: So that was seen as another instrument of self-determination for the Kashmiris, which

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:59.920
[Guest]: is why the Article 370, which came out of those negotiations and was subsequently adopted

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.080
[Guest]: in the Indian Constitution, was actually brought in.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:07.260
[Guest]: So the Indians toyed with many versions of what could constitute self-determination once

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:11.860
[Guest]: the plebiscite was seen as an option, which was either impractical or definitely likely

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:15.160
[Guest]: to go adverse under circumstances which were not acceptable to India.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.800
[Amit Varma]: And what's also interesting is that at one point in time during these negotiations, Nehru

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.320
[Amit Varma]: was at that moment for the plebiscite and Jinnah wasn't.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.780
[Amit Varma]: Jinnah was worried that after all that the raiders had done, that those places where

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:29.440
[Amit Varma]: they carried out all the violence and the looting and the rapes and everything, would

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.480
[Amit Varma]: definitely not vote for joining Pakistan.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, we'll come to 370 after the break.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:39.920
[Amit Varma]: But what also kind of strikes me as interesting here is how the incentives of the various

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.840
[Amit Varma]: parties are evolving, like Sheikh Abdullah gradually moves towards wanting independence.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:50.160
[Amit Varma]: The British pretty much side with Pakistan for much of this process.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.160
[Amit Varma]: How's that working out?

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.600
[Guest]: Like, what's the deal with the British?

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.600
[Guest]: Okay.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.840
[Guest]: So if you want to just sort of look at what the bottom line incentives of each side, and

00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:00.240
[Guest]: I'm conscious when I'm saying this, that I'm stripping things off certain historical nuance,

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.240
[Guest]: right?

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:05.040
[Guest]: But just to sort of get our listeners to have a sense of what were the, you know, bottom

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.360
[Guest]: line sort of stakes for which people were playing.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:13.240
[Guest]: I think it is fair to say, as far as India was concerned, that once the state of JNK

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:17.600
[Guest]: acceded, and Sheikh Abdullah sort of came on board, and as you say, they managed to

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.880
[Guest]: successfully sort of at least repulse the raiders from the valley of Kashmir, even if

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.000
[Guest]: they remained in other parts and so on.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000
[Guest]: The most important consideration became holding on to Kashmir, not just because it was a piece

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.360
[Guest]: of territory, which had strategic importance, which it had, but because and this is something

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:38.120
[Guest]: that comes up repeatedly in Indian cabinet discussions and Nehru's own sort of this thing,

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:43.760
[Guest]: that Kashmir in effect becomes a symbol of the kind of India that they want to build.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.920
[Guest]: That we don't believe in the two nation theory.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.480
[Guest]: This is a direct negation of two nation theory that a Muslim majority province should have

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:54.960
[Guest]: its own volition have accepted to come even when it was being caused by Pakistan through

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.960
[Guest]: the sending of raiders, right.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.040
[Guest]: So that becomes a symbolically a very important thing.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.160
[Guest]: You know, in retrospect, people say that Jawaharlal Nehru was emotional about Kashmir.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:07.440
[Guest]: I think he was, but I think the emotion was not the main governing thing in his thinking.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:13.400
[Guest]: What was the main governing thing was the idea that, you know, Kashmiris by their decision

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:18.120
[Guest]: had affirmed what he and his colleagues believed should be the Indian nationalist project going

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:23.960
[Guest]: forward, that independent India is not going to be an India, which is going to be a Hindustan.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:28.160
[Guest]: It is going to be an India, which would have enough space for all minorities for all diversity

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:34.080
[Guest]: to be accommodated and Kashmir tends to become a totem of India's commitment to secularism

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.080
[Amit Varma]: and pluralism.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.920
[Amit Varma]: Except a slight complication here and we'll come to that perhaps towards the end of the

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.200
[Amit Varma]: episode is that the Kashmiri will was never really known.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.200
[Amit Varma]: First it was Hari Singh exceeding and then it was Sheikh Abdullah on his side, but even

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.720
[Amit Varma]: he was not really an elected leader per se.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:52.840
[Amit Varma]: So the will of the people, which is, you know, central to the whole thing was never actually

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.400
[Amit Varma]: a certain, but we'll come to that later.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.400
[Guest]: I mean, absolutely.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.280
[Guest]: And I think we should come to it because I think it's an important question because it

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.840
[Guest]: has an important bearing for how the Kashmiris saw all of these.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.880
[Guest]: So let me just sort of finish up what I think were the incentives, right?

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.960
[Guest]: As far as Pakistan was concerned, I think for Jinnah, what he wanted very simply and

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.960
[Guest]: what he was playing for was to say that, listen, why don't we exchange the accession of Kashmir

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.600
[Guest]: and Hyderabad or some such thing, right?

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:19.160
[Guest]: So basically saying that, listen, I let go of the others if you let go of Kashmir, because

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.800
[Guest]: he did not, Jinnah had no commitment to the idea of self-determination in any straightforward

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:23.800
[Amit Varma]: sense.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.360
[Amit Varma]: And at some point, those bargaining chips disappear when we get Hyderabad.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.920
[Guest]: Yeah, when you get Hyderabad and all of Junagadh is taken away.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:32.280
[Guest]: So, but that is the game that Jinnah was trying to play was to say that, listen, can we sort

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.760
[Guest]: of come to some kind of thing and he resisted some proposals, which I think even Pakistanis

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.080
[Guest]: today would accept that in retrospect were the wrong choices to make.

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:43.200
[Guest]: Had he accepted that, you know, at that point of time, he would have done a plebiscite,

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.240
[Guest]: you know, maybe things would have gone in their favor, who knows, right, it was always

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.240
[Guest]: an open ended situation.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.560
[Amit Varma]: Like at one point, he rejected a plebiscite in Kashmir, you point out, because the Raiders

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.000
[Amit Varma]: seem to be winning at that point, he thought we're going to win anyway.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.560
[Guest]: So, you know, why, why take a chance, right?

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.480
[Guest]: So in a sense, that was his, that was the game that they were playing for.

00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.480
[Guest]: And they have…

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.480
[Guest]: They miscalculated.

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:05.040
[Guest]: They miscalculated, but they have continued to play that game for, you know, ever since,

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.040
[Guest]: so to speak.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.440
[Guest]: As far as the Kashmiris themselves are concerned, right?

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:11.200
[Guest]: I think, again, we have to sort of break them down into saying who are the Kashmiris, right?

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:17.120
[Guest]: So on the one hand, there was the Maharaja, who was also initially undecided between India

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.960
[Guest]: and Pakistan, and in fact, would have liked to have some kind of an independent status

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.680
[Guest]: with treaties with both countries, possibly.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.000
[Guest]: But then the Raiders came and…

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.400
[Guest]: They sort of forced his hand.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.400
[Guest]: He was indecisive.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.400
[Guest]: He did not know what to do.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.120
[Guest]: It was a difficult situation.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:32.400
[Guest]: Violence in adjoining province of Punjab was rattling his own population, both the Hindus

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:37.200
[Guest]: of Jammu, as well as the Muslims of Jammu and of the Kashmir Valley, right?

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.200
[Guest]: So there was all of this problem.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.080
[Guest]: Pakistan is a very far-flung, very big state, the original state of Jammu and Kashmir, you

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.440
[Guest]: know, is a very sort of big entity.

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.840
[Guest]: So there was his problem.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.040
[Guest]: Within Jammu itself, there were different views.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.760
[Guest]: The Muslims of Jammu were part of the original Muslim conference, out of which Sheikh Abdullah

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.800
[Guest]: had broken away and formed his national conference.

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.800
[Guest]: And many of them felt that we should actually go for accession to Pakistan.

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.800
[Amit Varma]: And you know, till a few minutes ago, I didn't know that Jammu used to be Muslim majority.

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:06.340
[Guest]: In fact, there's a good book by Christopher Sneddon, a scholar who has looked quite closely

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:10.720
[Guest]: into the sort of the violence in Jammu province in 1947.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.720
[Guest]: And what how that sort of shaped the sort of the thing, right?

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:19.840
[Guest]: And the the people of Kashmir themselves, right, of whether of the Kashmir Valley or

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:23.800
[Guest]: of this thing, as you say, none of them had an opportunity really to sort of have their

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.600
[Guest]: say in any of these things.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.000
[Guest]: But again, you know, I would say that that is broadly true of many other things.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.040
[Guest]: You know, the Indian Constituent Assembly was elected on a very limited franchise, but

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.400
[Guest]: then went on to shape a constitution for the rest of the country.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.400
[Guest]: It was never put to a referendum.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.400
[Guest]: You know, the American Constitution was put to a referendum, for instance, right?

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.080
[Guest]: Indian Constitution never been put to a referendum.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.800
[Guest]: So what constitutes self determination?

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.800
[Guest]: How are the people to speak for themselves?

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.160
[Guest]: So you know, is something that I think always remains an open question, right?

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.520
[Guest]: Any such arrangement is bound to have its limitations.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:58.400
[Guest]: And you are absolutely right that, you know, we never knew and can perhaps never know what

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:04.200
[Guest]: exactly people at that point of time felt about accession to India or to Pakistan, or,

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, joining some other state.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.760
[Amit Varma]: And I guess the moral force of that question really changes from time to time, depending

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.320
[Amit Varma]: on how the state is behaving and how the people feel about it.

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:17.000
[Amit Varma]: Separate question, we'll come back to that to just continue with the talk of incentives,

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.760
[Amit Varma]: for example, what made Abdullah sort of veer towards, you know, wanting independence in

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.080
[Guest]: the early 50s?

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.080
[Guest]: So there were two things.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:31.080
[Guest]: First of all, you know, again, it is not absolutely clear that independence was Abdullah's favorite

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:35.520
[Guest]: option, because I think his own position was a little more nuanced than independence, which

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.960
[Guest]: is the way it has been presented, both contemporaneously, it was presented like that.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:41.120
[Guest]: And that's the way, you know, we tend to think about it.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.320
[Guest]: So at the beginning, you know, and when the Raiders came into the state of Kashmir and

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:49.560
[Guest]: accession of Kashmir to India happened, Sheikh Abdullah was willing to sort of, you know,

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:54.600
[Guest]: go along with that move and support it, because he knew that India's support was needed to

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.920
[Guest]: ensure the freedom of the Kashmiris to make any choices for themselves, and not to be

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:01.400
[Guest]: simply annexed by Pakistan in a coercive move.

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:06.500
[Guest]: Sheikh Abdullah was for his time, a quite a progressive political thinker.

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:11.400
[Guest]: He had a idea for the development of Kashmir in political economic terms, something which

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.000
[Guest]: he called the Naya Kashmir Manifesto.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.280
[Guest]: And the Naya Kashmir agenda was something that Sheikh Abdullah envisaged among many

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:22.760
[Guest]: other things, very far reaching land reforms, right, because Kashmir was a highly feudal

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:27.680
[Guest]: state, you know, the ruler and his family and their extended plan held very extraordinary

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.080
[Guest]: amounts of land holdings across the state.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:33.240
[Guest]: So all of that land redistribution had to happen, land to the tiller, which was the

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:38.000
[Guest]: main slogan of Abdullah's sort of, you know, foot sort of followers, you know, the Kashmiri

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000
[Guest]: Muslims in the valley was a very important thing.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.920
[Guest]: He knew very well that Pakistan was unlikely to be a state where these kinds of policies

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:45.920
[Guest]: would flourish.

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:52.320
[Guest]: And I think he has been proven right by history, because the state of Pakistan could not deal

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:56.160
[Guest]: with the problems of large landholders who are very influential in Pakistani politics

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.960
[Guest]: of the time, right, the Punjabi sort of landlords, right, you know, they still have these enormous

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:00.960
[Amit Varma]: estates and such.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.960
[Guest]: And the dominance continues.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:02.960
[Guest]: Dominance continues.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:07.640
[Guest]: So the landed sort of aristocracy's lock hold on that state was something Abdullah felt

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.760
[Guest]: would prevent it.

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:14.120
[Guest]: Secondly, Abdullah knew that if Kashmir had to be kept together as a state, which he wanted

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.080
[Guest]: to, he did not just want to have the Kashmir Valley, but he believed that Jammu and Kashmir

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:22.680
[Guest]: had a certain kind of historical effective unity, which had to be kept in mind.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.960
[Guest]: And that that state was a very diverse one, because they were Hindus, they were Hindus

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.360
[Guest]: of different kinds, they were Muslims of different things, the Muslims of the Valley are different

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:34.720
[Guest]: from Muslims of Jammu, they are different in Ladakh, in the northern areas, which is

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:39.160
[Guest]: now with Pakistan, Mirpur had its own sort of history of troubles with Srinagar.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:43.200
[Guest]: So to hold all of these together, you needed something other than religion.

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.740
[Guest]: So in that sense, Sheikh Abdullah believed that a form of Kashmiriyat, which was a certain

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:53.400
[Guest]: variant of sort of non-communal Kashmiri nationalism was the best group.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:57.760
[Guest]: And like all nationalisms, it was an invented tradition, right, I mean, there's very good

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.200
[Guest]: books by historians like Chitralekha Zutsi, which tell us how the notion of Kashmiriyat

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.600
[Guest]: was constructed for a certain political project, right.

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.400
[Guest]: And that is a very important part of what he was trying to do.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:13.040
[Guest]: And he believed that that project had much closer affinities with the project of Indian

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:18.640
[Guest]: nationalism, which Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhi and Patel and others were espousing, rather

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.680
[Unknown]: than Pakistan.

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.560
[Guest]: So his incentives initially were therefore to sort of join this thing.

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:27.480
[Guest]: But he knew that as a democratic leader, he could only sort of, he could work with India

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.640
[Guest]: only if he would carry the people along with him.

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:36.000
[Guest]: And once it became clear that a plebiscite was unlikely to be held, that the Indian leadership

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.120
[Guest]: themselves were, you know, rethinking the wisdom of a plebiscite, telling him privately

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.560
[Guest]: that listen, why don't we do other things, look at Constituent Assembly, other forms

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:48.440
[Guest]: of democratic, you know, ways of ascertaining power and so on, popular will and so on, Sheikh

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.920
[Guest]: Abdullah himself started having concerns.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:55.400
[Guest]: The second thing was that I think when everyone went to the UN, whether it was in January

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.720
[Guest]: 1948, they assumed that there's going to be a quick resolution of the problem.

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:03.520
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, everyone thought one way or the other, some solution will be sort of suggested

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.160
[Amit Varma]: and the problem will be settled.

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:09.520
[Amit Varma]: And also whatever talk of a plebiscite came up, one of the conditions was that the administration

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.080
[Amit Varma]: has to change.

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.520
[Amit Varma]: And even if he remains at the head of it, the composition has to change completely.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.680
[Amit Varma]: And he probably, I'm guessing at that point felt threatened by that.

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.800
[Guest]: And Abdullah himself did not want a plebiscite, right?

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:20.800
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:24.320
[Guest]: So all I'm trying to say is that it is not just the government of India, which was resigning

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.320
[Guest]: from a plebiscite.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:29.880
[Guest]: Abdullah himself came to doubt whether a plebiscite will A, work in his favor, even temporarily,

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:33.840
[Guest]: which is to say that he might have to step out of power to allow some kind of administration.

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.240
[Guest]: And as I said, they had doubts about whether a UN supervised administration actually going

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:41.800
[Guest]: to be fair, because they may just treat this as a Hindu Muslim problem and say that Muslims

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.560
[Guest]: have to go to Pakistan.

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.560
[Guest]: And then there was this thing.

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:49.960
[Guest]: So Abdullah's thinking, the way it was evolving, was that the Kashmir problem can only be solved

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.280
[Guest]: if there is some agreement between India and Pakistan.

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:56.360
[Guest]: And the way that Abdullah would try and think of it, and the way that he articulated it

00:53:56.360 --> 00:54:00.300
[Guest]: almost till 1964, till Jawaharlal Nehru's death, was that Kashmir has to become a bridge

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.960
[Guest]: between India and Pakistan, right?

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:08.400
[Guest]: Both countries in some ways have an interest in guaranteeing the independence of Kashmir.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.760
[Guest]: So when you talk about independence, it's not necessarily clear that he wanted a totally

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.760
[Guest]: independent state.

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:16.600
[Guest]: But I think what he would have liked was some kind of an arrangement where both India and

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:20.960
[Guest]: Pakistan would guarantee the security and other things of Kashmir, and would accept

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:25.320
[Guest]: that this was not an arena where their competitions spill over to, and so on, right?

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.960
[Guest]: So I think these were all ideas up there, because it was such a unclear situation.

00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:34.400
[Guest]: See, you know, the reality is that, you know, at any given point of time, future is highly

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.720
[Guest]: open ended.

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.860
[Guest]: You just don't know what is coming out of something, you know, when the Indians were

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:43.160
[Guest]: discussing the cabinet mission plan, it is quite unlikely that they could have envisaged

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:46.240
[Guest]: that actually rejecting this option meant a total partition of the country.

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.720
[Guest]: But that is what it even ended up in, right?

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.040
[Guest]: So future is open ended.

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:54.400
[Guest]: And Abdullah was thinking through how best to solve this problem, when a plebiscite was

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.960
[Guest]: not acceptable to India, when it was not acceptable to him as likely to be, he did not want a

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:02.280
[Guest]: straightforward partition of the state on religious lines.

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.280
[Guest]: So what is the way out?

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:07.600
[Guest]: At the same time, his own people have their wishes, you know, he cannot sort of disregard

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.000
[Guest]: what the people might want.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.880
[Guest]: So he had to triangulate many different things.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.800
[Guest]: And it was in that context that he was looking at various kinds of things.

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:18.720
[Guest]: And of course, then the government of India took a view that Nawar Lal Nehru personally,

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.800
[Guest]: that Abdullah was sort of moving towards independence.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:25.600
[Guest]: And that the best way to sort of then solve the problem is to lock him up, remove him

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.920
[Guest]: as Chief Minister of State, imprison him arbitrarily.

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:31.880
[Guest]: And then, you know, try and push through other kinds of solutions, all of which turned out

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:37.000
[Guest]: to be options, which were only either worse or much worse than each other.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.800
[Amit Varma]: And at this point, the British incentives also are because of the way things are sort

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:46.360
[Amit Varma]: of heading towards Pakistan, like you talk about, you know, how their delegation was

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.120
[Amit Varma]: led by this chap called Philip Noel Baker.

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:52.600
[Amit Varma]: And quoting from your book, again, quote, Noel Baker believed that Britain's position

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.480
[Amit Varma]: in the Middle East was doddering.

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:58.560
[Amit Varma]: In scurrying from Palestine, they had already alienated the Arabs.

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:02.300
[Amit Varma]: The latter might be further inflamed if Britain wobbled on Kashmir.

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:06.560
[Amit Varma]: And now you're quoting him, it was important to avoid the danger of antagonizing the whole

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:11.440
[Amit Varma]: of Islam by appearing to side with India against Pakistan, stop quote.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:16.240
[Amit Varma]: So which is why even though they are sort of acting as impartial mediators or whatever,

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:20.360
[Guest]: they're playing a role, which, yeah, and in some ways, it's not so surprising, right?

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:25.700
[Guest]: See, the British, it's rational for them to not just rational, the British never conceded

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:30.720
[Guest]: the Indian National Congress's claim that they spoke for all communities in India.

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:34.320
[Guest]: They created the Pakistan demand out of Muslim League during the Second World War.

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:38.540
[Guest]: And again, something we discussed at length, when we talked about that period, right?

00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:43.720
[Guest]: It was a, it was a demand, which they encouraged Jinnah to come out with, because they wanted

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:46.640
[Guest]: to undermine the Congress's claim that it spoke for the entire nation.

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:51.080
[Guest]: Now, obviously, that was a grandiose, arrogant claim in its own right.

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:58.400
[Guest]: But there was a core of truth to it, which was that Indian nationalism under Gandhi and

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:05.520
[Guest]: other leaders of the Congress was not committed to a project of majoritarianism, but of pluralism.

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.960
[Guest]: And that was something the British never accepted.

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:12.880
[Guest]: And what Philip Noyle Baker is doing in the UN, effectively is a continuation of the same

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.080
[Guest]: principle of saying this is a Muslim majority area.

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:17.360
[Guest]: Why should it be with India, right?

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.840
[Guest]: What right does India have to sort of insist that there should even be a plebiscite there?

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.120
[Guest]: It should have automatically gone to Pakistan, right?

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:25.680
[Guest]: So the presumption is that, that is the way these things should have worked.

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:29.880
[Guest]: And that if for whatever reason, the Kashmiris, because they were under attack from tribals,

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:34.400
[Guest]: etc, of Pakistan felt that, you know, they'd actually be better off not being with Pakistan,

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.760
[Guest]: that was the wrong decision, right?

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:41.600
[Guest]: So in a sense, this is an old model of the imperial understanding of the peoples of the

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.040
[Guest]: Indian subcontinent.

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:45.600
[Guest]: And of course, the Middle East, as I say, you know, the context there was that they

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.440
[Guest]: had sort of also gotten out of Palestine.

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:52.400
[Guest]: So they just felt that, you know, their standing in the Muslim world, so to speak, was going

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.400
[Guest]: down.

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:57.920
[Guest]: Now, all of these were very much in keeping with their attitude towards India, the problem

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.860
[Guest]: of India and the problems of Indian nationalism, right?

00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:05.480
[Guest]: And their refusal to accept that Indian nationalism could actually be something which would be

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:08.560
[Guest]: beyond the interests of this or that community.

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.440
[Guest]: They never wanted to concede that.

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:13.680
[Amit Varma]: And an interesting dynamic in this period, which again, I wasn't aware of till I read

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:19.160
[Amit Varma]: your book, is that in both the armies, because there weren't Indians and Pakistanis senior

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:24.280
[Amit Varma]: enough, basically, both the India and Pakistan armies were headed by British officers, who

00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:28.320
[Amit Varma]: were therefore had been essentially colleagues with their counterparts.

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.320
[Amit Varma]: And there was a rule and function that if there is a war between the two sides, all

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:33.440
[Amit Varma]: the British officers will step away from the battle.

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:36.120
[Amit Varma]: There was a stand down order, so there was a stand down order.

00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:40.040
[Amit Varma]: So how did that sort of bizarre dynamic shape the...

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:43.720
[Guest]: It was a bizarre dynamic, because, you know, and again, there's something the background

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.200
[Guest]: to it, we discussed when we...

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:49.800
[Amit Varma]: And what it also means is none of the armies are very keen to do battle at all, in a sense.

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.800
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:55.560
[Guest]: So the, the British commanders in chief of both the Indian and the Pakistani armies certainly

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:58.480
[Guest]: had a back channel kind of a dialogue, they were in touch with their high commissioners,

00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:02.580
[Guest]: the British high commissioners in both countries, to try and say that, listen, we will try and

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.680
[Guest]: make sure that there is no war, we want to sort of prevent both sides from doing all

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.680
[Guest]: of that stuff.

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:11.320
[Guest]: Now, but the reality is that I think it would be a bit of an exaggeration to suggest that

00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:14.360
[Guest]: their views, at least as far as India was concerned, were decisive.

00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.600
[Guest]: I don't think that's the case.

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:19.600
[Guest]: I don't think it is the case, as some historians have made it out.

00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:21.120
[Guest]: And I think there's a plausible argument there.

00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:25.480
[Guest]: But I don't think it really stacks up in the light of everything that we know.

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:29.760
[Guest]: That it was the commander in chief who scuttled in effect an Indian offensive in Kashmir and

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:30.760
[Guest]: so on.

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:31.760
[Guest]: I don't think that was the case.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.760
[Guest]: There were genuine constraints.

00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:37.080
[Guest]: Beyond that, there was these political considerations about what going to a war with Pakistan will

00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:38.080
[Guest]: entail.

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:42.200
[Guest]: And then I think in some ways, their political preferences aligned with that of the Prime

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:47.160
[Guest]: Minister who himself was keen to sort of avoid escalation in the context of the violence

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.600
[Guest]: of partition and so on.

00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.520
[Guest]: So I think, yes, it was a bizarre situation.

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.800
[Guest]: The Indians recognized it to be a bizarre situation.

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:55.680
[Guest]: But there were many arbitrary things about that situation.

00:59:55.680 --> 01:00:00.280
[Guest]: I mean, think of it this way, Lord Mountbatten remains the Governor General of India after

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:05.520
[Guest]: independence because India, you know, is sort of has dominion status during that period.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.800
[Guest]: But not only is he Governor General, and you would imagine that is some kind of very constitutional

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.800
[Guest]: figurehead.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:13.840
[Guest]: But Mountbatten then becomes chairman of the Defense Committee of the cabinet, even though

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.920
[Guest]: he's not a member of the cabinet, right?

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.000
[Guest]: And there he is quite influential in shaping the way that people think about these kinds

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
[Guest]: of questions.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.180
[Guest]: So there were many anomalies to that period.

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:26.840
[Guest]: And it was a very transitionally period, you know, it's a period where so many things were

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.840
[Guest]: in flux.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.920
[Guest]: And in some ways, the Pakistanis were much more dependent on British officers than India

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.920
[Guest]: was.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:36.200
[Guest]: In fact, Pakistan continued to remain highly dependent on British officers in even in their

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.800
[Guest]: army for much later than India.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.920
[Guest]: And even India, it's worth recalling that did not have a first Indian naval chief of

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.200
[Guest]: staff till the mid 1950s.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.640
[Amit Varma]: So before moving on quick counterfactual, like one interesting part of your book, which

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:54.920
[Amit Varma]: we'll again get to is the sort of the Bengal crisis of 1950-51, which also shaped the way

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.560
[Amit Varma]: Nehru approached the Kashmir issue, which was left after that.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:02.560
[Amit Varma]: And one tidbit there, which you point out is that Nehru constantly thought of resigning,

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.480
[Amit Varma]: because he was he was fed up.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.920
[Amit Varma]: At one point, he had even prepared a resignation for the cabinet, which he didn't give through.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.840
[Amit Varma]: And he just wanted to move on in the case of the Bengal, it was because he wanted to

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.280
[Amit Varma]: go in his personal capacity, the way sort of Gandhi would have done and sort of visit

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.440
[Amit Varma]: the areas and try to bring about peace because he was personally affected by that.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.060
[Amit Varma]: But he thought of resignation.

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:27.400
[Amit Varma]: And even apart from that, there is a counterfactual question of which which critics of Nehru would

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:32.000
[Amit Varma]: ask today, that what if Nehru hadn't been the Prime Minister, which I ask you now in

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.840
[Amit Varma]: this context, but even otherwise, it's a fascinating question.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:41.320
[Amit Varma]: Because if one looks at sort of Indian political history during that period, what really appears

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:45.320
[Amit Varma]: to be the case is that Nehru is a man alone and a man apart.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:50.140
[Amit Varma]: And he just happens to be Prime Minister and a lot of India's direction is shaped by that.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:55.160
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise, there is a very strong strand of Hindu nationalist leaders within the Congress,

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, like Patel and Panth and Rajendra Prasad and so on.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.200
[Amit Varma]: And that's a very strong stream of leaders.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.960
[Amit Varma]: And it's just kind of happenstance that it is this one man who thinks in this particular

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.800
[Amit Varma]: way, who happens to be in charge.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:15.400
[Amit Varma]: So in the limited context of all our battles to form the Indian Union, you know, with Kashmir,

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:19.720
[Amit Varma]: which is the subject of today, but even Junagadh, Hyderabad and whatever else was happening,

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:23.960
[Amit Varma]: how would things have been different, you think, if say Patel was PM and Nehru was not

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.680
[Guest]: on the scene, he was a private citizen?

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:29.120
[Guest]: Well, you know, it's a very large counterfactual question to ask.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.920
[Guest]: And it's not a cop out.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.880
[Guest]: But I just want to say that, you know, counterfactual questions operate best when they are in very

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.040
[Guest]: narrow domains, right, when you can control for a number of things.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:41.440
[Guest]: And this is the kind of counterfactual question, I think, which leads us more into speculation

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.720
[Guest]: than to a historically informed answer.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:48.200
[Guest]: But I would, in the first instance, suggest that some of the premises of your question

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.560
[Guest]: are themselves questionable.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:55.520
[Guest]: It is true to say that, yes, there were elements within the Congress Party, which believed

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.840
[Guest]: that in the wake of partition, you know, Muslims of India had to prove their loyalty.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.880
[Guest]: Even Sardar Patel believed that.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:06.040
[Guest]: But I think it is also in all fairness and historical justice to be pointed out that

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.800
[Guest]: people like Rajendra Prasad, Sardar Patel, were Gandhians to the core.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.080
[Guest]: They were people who led the Gandhian campaigns, right?

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.880
[Guest]: When we think about Gandhian nationalism, they were the foot soldiers of that nationalism.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:21.600
[Guest]: And I think it would be wrong to assimilate them to the Hindu nationalist ideology, which

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.280
[Guest]: the Hindu Mahasabha espoused with all clarity, even back in the day.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:29.680
[Guest]: Just because there were certain degrees of overlap, which occurred as a part of consequence

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.160
[Guest]: of the, you know, the partition itself.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.320
[Guest]: Like, for instance, in Ramchandra Guha's book, India after Gandhi, he, you know, presents

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:42.160
[Guest]: a circular which is circulated by the Ministry of Home Affairs, saying, advising all Department

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.400
[Guest]: of Government of India to keep a look at the sort of their Muslim officers and so on to

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.480
[Guest]: ensure that they were being loyal to the state, right?

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.920
[Guest]: Now, again, I don't think this was an ideological move on the part of the Ministry of State,

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:57.600
[Guest]: which was led by Sardar Patel, but a reflexive reaction to what was happening in the context

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.320
[Guest]: of the sort of thing, right?

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:05.800
[Guest]: And let's also remember that Patel was the one who took it upon himself after the assassination

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.880
[Guest]: of Gandhi to ban the RSS and really cracked down on them.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.160
[Guest]: So I don't think he's as easily assimilable to that.

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:16.280
[Guest]: But yes, there were people of varying degrees of Hindu conservatism, Hindu nationalism in

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.280
[Guest]: the Congress.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.160
[Guest]: And in fact, Nehru has a showdown with people like Pashutam Das Tandon after Patel's death

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.160
[Amit Varma]: as well.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.160
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.680
[Amit Varma]: In fact, just to sort of give you a couple of illustrations of what I mean, and my knowledge

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.400
[Amit Varma]: is obviously far more limited than yours, but I'm just kind of thinking aloud because

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.800
[Amit Varma]: I've done episodes on these recently and read these specific books recently.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:40.040
[Amit Varma]: And there is an interesting book called Ayodhya, the Dark Knight by Dhrendra Jha and another.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.400
[Amit Varma]: That's about the installation of the idol.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.720
[Amit Varma]: That's the installation of the idol.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.680
[Amit Varma]: And what is interesting there is again, in that narrative, Nehru is a man apart in the

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:51.000
[Amit Varma]: sense that the idol of Ram is installed in the Babri Masjid complex.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.880
[Amit Varma]: And Nehru immediately says that something must be done, get the idol out, sort the issue

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.200
[Amit Varma]: out.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.920
[Amit Varma]: And Congressman Govind Ballabh Pant, who is CM of UP, Lal Bahadur Shastri, who is Home

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Minister of UP are all basically complicit.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.440
[Amit Varma]: And they don't follow Nehru's instructions.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.960
[Amit Varma]: The idols remain there.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.800
[Amit Varma]: And then eventually it becomes a fait accompli, they are just there and it's too late to do

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.600
[Amit Varma]: anything about them.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.040
[Amit Varma]: And the other book I read recently was about the Gita Press by Akshay Mukul, with whom

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.280
[Amit Varma]: I've recorded an episode, but it'll come out after this in a few weeks time because I have

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.920
[Amit Varma]: a bit of a backlog.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:29.440
[Amit Varma]: But and there again, what I find in the narrative is that and the Gita Press, of course, is

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:32.600
[Amit Varma]: this publishing house, which has this monthly magazine called Kalyan and they're carrying

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:38.960
[Amit Varma]: out this massive cultural campaign to build Hindutva nationalism and Hindi nationalism.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:43.120
[Amit Varma]: And there again, you find that a lot of prominent congressmen right from the 20s onwards, whether

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:48.660
[Amit Varma]: it's, you know, the generation of Madan Mohan Malviya, or even at this point, people like

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:53.240
[Amit Varma]: Pant and Shastri and Gulzari Lal Nanda, who are all very prominent figures.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:58.160
[Amit Varma]: And my sense of reading about the politics of this entire period was that unlike today,

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:02.160
[Amit Varma]: when the Congress, you know, does some kind of soft Hindutva, but that's just posturing

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.760
[Amit Varma]: and basically, they don't have leaders like that anymore.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:10.120
[Amit Varma]: That in those days, the Hindu nationalist element within the Congress was really quite

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.120
[Guest]: strong.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:15.560
[Guest]: And it was but all I'm trying to say is that it is important still to make some distinctions

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:24.440
[Guest]: between that element of Hindu nationalist things and the policies of the Hindu Mahasabha

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:28.920
[Guest]: or the RSS at that point of time, right, they were overlaps, you know, it is part of a continuum

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:29.920
[Guest]: of some kind.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:36.400
[Guest]: But I think particularly with respect to people like Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad, I think

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:43.880
[Guest]: it would be, in my opinion, historically sort of, you know, in a sense, incorrect to classify

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.760
[Guest]: them as Hindu nationalists in quite that sense.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.160
[Guest]: These two people in particular, I think you're absolutely right that, you know, there were

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:54.400
[Guest]: Govind Nallapant, there was Sampoornanand and again, you know, if the old sort of, you

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.800
[Guest]: know, the motto of the Jan Sangh, so to speak, was Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan, right, I mean,

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:03.240
[Guest]: there were many people in the Congress who believed in that trinity of things to come

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:07.360
[Guest]: together, right, especially in the UP Congress, which is why Nehru then has a major showdown

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.800
[Guest]: with Parshottam Das Tandon, who's a representative of that kind of views, right.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:15.840
[Guest]: And, but, but again, my only point is to say that, you know, Jawaharlal Nehru was not a

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:20.080
[Guest]: sort of lone crusader in quite that sense, right.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:24.720
[Guest]: He believed that certain lines had to be laid down absolutely clearly and should not.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:28.840
[Guest]: And one of the key things, for instance, you know, his discussion with Rajendra Prasad

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:33.320
[Guest]: about the Somnath temple inauguration, right, you know, because the president sort of wants

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.400
[Guest]: to go and inaugurate the Somnath temple.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.600
[Guest]: And again, you know, immediately after the accession of Junagadh, when the first speech

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.520
[Guest]: is given by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, he says the Somnath temple is going to be built again,

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.520
[Guest]: right.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.160
[Guest]: He makes a promise at that point of time.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:48.800
[Guest]: So there are all of these kinds of strains that someone like Nehru has to deal with,

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:49.800
[Guest]: right.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:54.520
[Guest]: And he, of course, wants to make sure that as the government of India, they are trying

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:59.840
[Guest]: to remain as true as possible to the secular identity of the state and not sort of compromise

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.400
[Guest]: that by doing various kinds of things.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.560
[Guest]: But I think it may be a little sort of unfair to say that, you know, he's the only person.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:08.880
[Guest]: It's in that context that I'd like to say that when you're pointing out rightly that,

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:11.520
[Guest]: you know, there are two or three instances when Nehru feels that, listen, I should just

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.600
[Guest]: get away from this, it's partly because he just feels that the instinct within his party

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:21.920
[Guest]: is to still believe that in the wake of partition, the Muslims of India should carry some extra

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.080
[Guest]: burden to sort of prove their loyalty to the state.

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.600
[Guest]: That is something that he cannot countenance.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.800
[Guest]: He says, yes, Pakistan was created in the name of these people.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.640
[Guest]: But there are millions of Muslims who have chosen for whatever reasons to remain in this

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.400
[Guest]: country.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:40.400
[Guest]: And if we have to be true to our values, then we have to sort of not expect them to prove

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.000
[Guest]: their loyalty to us.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.900
[Guest]: That is something that he detests.

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:47.320
[Guest]: And he says that time and again, this idea that, you know, they should somehow be punished

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:51.520
[Guest]: or that anything happens to Hindus in Pakistan, Muslims in India should be punished for that,

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.880
[Guest]: right, is totally abhorrent to me.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.400
[Guest]: He says that repeatedly that, you know, I just cannot stand this line of thinking.

01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.840
[Guest]: So there were those kinds of differences.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:02.480
[Guest]: But I would still say that, you know, it might be going a little too far to sort of classify

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.840
[Guest]: people like Patel as Hindu nationalists at that point of time.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:09.000
[Guest]: I mean, there was definitely Patel, I think, in the wake of partition felt that there was

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.600
[Guest]: an extra obligation on Muslims to sort of, in fact, he says that even in the Constituent

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.240
[Guest]: Assembly, right, when there is this discussion on doing away with communal legislatures

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.240
[Guest]: and so on.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.640
[Guest]: He comes out and says, he says that, you know, you guys have sort of, this is what has led

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.640
[Guest]: to the creation of Pakistan.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.760
[Guest]: Why do you want to continue with this stuff?

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.280
[Guest]: The best thing is for you to prove your loyalty to the state by sort of doing away with that

01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.280
[Guest]: stuff.

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.000
[Guest]: Muslims accept it, right?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
[Guest]: And that continues, right?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.740
[Guest]: So the separate representation for Muslims in legislature goes away.

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:34.740
[Guest]: So Patel is quite forthright.

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:38.680
[Guest]: And again, I think what is interesting is that you had a government at that point of

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:42.440
[Guest]: time where these discussions happened quite openly, right?

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:45.800
[Guest]: People's allegiances to various kinds of things were well known.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.020
[Guest]: There were differences which were articulated.

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:51.840
[Guest]: And Jawaharlal Nehru stuck to the line that, listen, whatever be the historical reasons

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:56.440
[Guest]: for the creation of Pakistan, the Muslims of India cannot carry that cross forever.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.760
[Guest]: And that any state which expects them to do that is not being fair to them.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.940
[Amit Varma]: No, and I think I accidentally touched upon a hot button during this digression because

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:08.560
[Amit Varma]: these days, of course, there is a binary around Patel because the Hindu right is trying to

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.840
[Amit Varma]: claim him as one of their own.

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:13.040
[Amit Varma]: So it becomes a binary, is he a Hindu nationalist, is he a Gandhian?

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.920
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, people contain multitudes and he more than others behave with great

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.880
[Amit Varma]: responsibility when he was in government.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:24.640
[Amit Varma]: But my limited question was that in the sort of in the context of India's battle to sort

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.880
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, form the union to bring all these states in, a contention is made by many

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:34.240
[Amit Varma]: in the Hindu right today that he would have behaved differently on Kashmir.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.880
[Amit Varma]: And as you've already pointed out, in the instance of POK or Azad Kashmir, whatever

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.520
[Amit Varma]: you call it, that's not exactly the case.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.720
[Amit Varma]: They were on the same page.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.920
[Amit Varma]: And it was, in fact, pretty much the consensus within the Indian administration then that

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.400
[Amit Varma]: it is not even possible for our army to retake those areas.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.360
[Guest]: So the whole question is, in fact, I would go further.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:57.200
[Guest]: If you look at the historical record, it is very clear that when Patel was looking at

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.720
[Guest]: the issue of Hyderabad immediately after independence and Nizam was sort of doing this and the issue

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:05.800
[Guest]: of Kashmir came, Patel and he said later on in a public speech, actually in the same speech

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:09.800
[Guest]: in Junagadh when he announces the Somnath temple would be recreated and so on.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:16.960
[Guest]: He says that we had told the Pakistanis that you give Kashmir and we'll give Hyderabad.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:17.960
[Guest]: Right.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:18.960
[Guest]: Why?

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.320
[Guest]: Because Patel understood that holding on to Hyderabad was much more important than holding

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.400
[Guest]: on to Kashmir.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.600
[Guest]: So this idea that in retrospect that, you know, Patel would have attached some extraordinary

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.240
[Guest]: great importance to Kashmir, etc. is, I think, part of an ideological fantasy, which remains

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.900
[Guest]: that, you know, all of Kashmir should have been taken by India militarily.

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.120
[Guest]: The reality is that as Prime Minister, Patel would have been faced with the same kinds

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.920
[Guest]: of resource, logistical, geographic, strategic, political, international political constraints

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.560
[Guest]: that Jawaharlal Nehru operated in.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.960
[Guest]: And let us not face, forget it, Patel was very much party to each of these decisions.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:48.960
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.960
[Guest]: He was there.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:54.480
[Guest]: All of these decisions were taken, this thing, those records are available for historians

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.200
[Guest]: or anyone interested to go and look it up.

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:02.120
[Guest]: And I think the case is absolutely clear that on all of these decisions, Patel ultimately

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.540
[Guest]: was on board.

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.760
[Guest]: Maybe they had differences of opinion about whether the Indian army should move into Hyderabad

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:10.840
[Guest]: in April, as opposed to when they moved in later on in the year, right?

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.480
[Guest]: But there was no difference of opinion that ultimately, if that's what it came down to,

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.040
[Guest]: it would have to be done, which is why in response to your previous counterfactual question,

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.960
[Guest]: I said, if Nehru had been forced with a choice, he still would have used force because I think

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:25.000
[Guest]: that is the way the situation was shaping up at that point of time.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.120
[Guest]: And I don't think it is at all plausible to suggest that if you had a different kind of

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:33.600
[Guest]: a thing, as I said, even Shama Prasad Mukherjee in later on accepted that as a member of the

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.280
[Guest]: cabinet, he was very much party to these decisions as anyone else because these were discussed

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.280
[Guest]: and cabinet taken.

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:43.440
[Guest]: These were not unilaterally taken by Nehru or by Patel and Nehru between the two of them.

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.440
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.820
[Amit Varma]: And one thing that also happens like, okay, so, you know, Junagadh and Hyderabad are kind

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:50.960
[Amit Varma]: of sorted, Kashmir is still simmering.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.160
[Amit Varma]: And meanwhile, violence breaks out in Bengal.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:58.800
[Amit Varma]: And again, this is something that is largely forgotten today, but is key to how it shaped

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:03.720
[Amit Varma]: Nehru's later tactical strategic response rather to do what to do about the Kashmir

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.720
[Guest]: issue.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:05.720
[Guest]: Tell me a little bit about that.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.600
[Guest]: So, the Bengal sort of, you know, crisis really comes up in 1950.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:15.240
[Guest]: There is a sort of communal violence against Hindus who are a substantial majority in what

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:18.320
[Guest]: was East Bengal or East Pakistan, today Bangladesh.

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.640
[Guest]: And there was a flow of refugees from there.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:27.200
[Guest]: And then in response, there was sort of retaliatory violence against Muslims in West Bengal, right.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.880
[Guest]: And that is exactly the dynamic that was prevalent at that point of time.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.720
[Guest]: And again, we tend to forget it.

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:35.880
[Guest]: And the issue took such magnitude that the Indian government finally had to threaten

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:42.000
[Guest]: Pakistan that if the minorities of Kashmir in Pakistan were not protected, they may have

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.720
[Guest]: to resort to force in order to sort of get in sort of this issue, so to speak.

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:55.040
[Guest]: Again, Nehru and Patel were on somewhat different lines of this thing, because Nehru felt that,

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.160
[Guest]: you know, the use of force is something that can actually have negative consequences, not

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.760
[Guest]: something that we should rush into.

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.840
[Guest]: I don't think Patel disagreed with that proposition, per se.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:09.560
[Guest]: But where they've sort of differed from each other was on this question of saying that,

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:14.520
[Guest]: listen, is retributive violence against Muslims in India, something that the government of

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:15.520
[Guest]: India should also countenance?

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.400
[Guest]: Or is it our job to sort of say that, listen, even that is not acceptable, right?

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.840
[Guest]: So it is actually on that issue.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:23.400
[Guest]: And it's in that context that actually Nehru writes a very interesting letter to Patel.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:29.160
[Guest]: He says that there is a constant call for vicarious punishment of Muslims in India,

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.960
[Guest]: in response to what is happening to Hindus in Pakistan.

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:35.240
[Guest]: And that to me is abhorrent, because many of those calls are coming from congressmen

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.640
[Guest]: also, right, local congressmen in the Bengal Congress, etc, were pointing out.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:44.840
[Guest]: So in that context, you know, Jawaharlal Nehru felt that ultimately that crisis was averted.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.480
[Guest]: The two countries did not go to war.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:53.720
[Guest]: But what you had was a pact affirming that both sides will protect the rights of minorities,

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:57.120
[Guest]: which is known as the Nehru-Liaquat pact, which was done.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:01.040
[Guest]: And actually it is in response to that pact that Shama Prasad Mukherjee and KC Neogi,

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.560
[Guest]: whose other leader, they resigned from the cabinet.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:09.520
[Guest]: And Mukherjee then sort of starts up his own party, the Jana Sangh, the following year.

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:16.920
[Guest]: And that whole episode has a certain kind of implication for Kashmir, primarily through

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:21.960
[Guest]: the sort of impact that it has on Sheikh Abdullah, right, because what Sheikh Abdullah realizes

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.440
[Guest]: is that the communal problem in India still remains unsettled.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:31.040
[Guest]: The position of Muslims within the Indian case itself is always something that is problematic.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.040
[Guest]: And once Shama Prasad Mukherjee and the Jana Sangh begin this sort of national campaign

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:39.440
[Guest]: to say that the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir should be done away with and the state should

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:44.440
[Guest]: be fully integrated, etc., then Sheikh Abdullah starts worrying about what does it mean to

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:49.680
[Guest]: be integrated within India, where Nehru actually seems, as you're saying, like a lone crusader

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:54.680
[Guest]: for secularism, when so many other mainstream voices are calling actually for second class

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:58.420
[Guest]: treatment of Muslims, to put it, you know, in no fine terms.

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:03.420
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things Nehru sort of did here, which you've pointed out affected how he also

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:07.860
[Amit Varma]: then looked at the Kashmir dispute later, is that there was a massive buildup of troops

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:12.840
[Amit Varma]: on the Indian side, which was partly to, you know, get the Pakistanis to do what you want

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:17.120
[Amit Varma]: to do, without actually taking the decision to go to war because he was he was still hesitant

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.120
[Amit Varma]: about that.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.920
[Amit Varma]: But he was not hesitant at, you know, showcasing that force, so to say.

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:25.480
[Guest]: No, it isn't that sense that I say that, you know, you have to understand Nehru was standing

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.760
[Guest]: at the juncture of the liberal and realist traditions in thinking about international

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:30.280
[Guest]: politics, right?

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:35.960
[Guest]: Because he knew that this was such an important situation as such a grave situation where

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:40.080
[Guest]: hundreds of thousands of, you know, Hindus are coming from this thing, there is a huge

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:43.680
[Guest]: sort of cauldron boiling up in India itself, and already some Muslims are being attacked

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:47.560
[Guest]: and moving in the other direction, that if you have to sort of prevent a recurrence of

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:53.400
[Guest]: 1947 type violence, which happened in the Punjab, then you had to sort of compel the

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:57.880
[Guest]: Pakistanis in some ways to see reason and put an end to those things, which only they

01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.940
[Guest]: could do, right?

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.560
[Guest]: And it is in that context that he said, yes, if the threat of force is what we have to

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.360
[Guest]: do, then let's move towards that.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:10.360
[Guest]: And even as he moved towards that, he understood that if this really escalated into a conflict,

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.720
[Guest]: then the outcome might be actually quite similar to what you have.

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:16.200
[Guest]: Now, this is how strategic choices typically presented themselves to someone like him at

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.200
[Guest]: that point of time, right?

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.480
[Guest]: There were no easy choices to make, the trade-offs were always very difficult.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:25.840
[Guest]: And Nehru wanted to balance the trade-offs between realist considerations of saying,

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:30.480
[Guest]: force is one instrument which we have to shape Pakistan's thinking about this, to sensitize

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.400
[Guest]: them that if they do not get the situation under control, it's going to sort of lead

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.240
[Guest]: to a major conflict with India.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:39.880
[Guest]: But at the same time, we want to avoid the possibility of an actual conflict because

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:44.120
[Guest]: that conflict will mean other kinds of costs, not just for India, but for the people of

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.120
[Guest]: India, right?

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:49.000
[Guest]: So in that sense, he had to sort of constantly balance between these two considerations.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.880
[Guest]: And it is in that sense that I was framing Nehru as a person who stood not at the crossroads

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:58.080
[Guest]: of these kinds of traditions, you know, about thinking about the role of force.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.840
[Amit Varma]: This kind of sort of showcasing the use of force without actually, you know, crossing

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:06.200
[Amit Varma]: the border and going to the other side is sort of, you know, a tool that's been used

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.560
[Amit Varma]: by different Prime Ministers at different times, like Indira Gandhi, if I remember correctly,

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:14.680
[Amit Varma]: we discussed in our Bangladesh episode, sort of used it, you know, just before the war

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:18.420
[Amit Varma]: officially erupted, even though, you know, it kind of goaded the Pakistanis into making

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:19.420
[Amit Varma]: the first move there.

01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:23.580
[Amit Varma]: And Prime Minister Vajpayee did it after the parliament attacks, where the whole idea was

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:29.040
[Amit Varma]: not that we are going to attack, but that we are going to, with sufficient credibility,

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:35.680
[Amit Varma]: said that we might attack so that the international community steps in and puts pressure on Pakistan.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:39.720
[Amit Varma]: When it came to Kashmir, was the international community a big factor?

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.280
[Guest]: Well, again, it's the same thing, right?

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:47.040
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at the 1950 Bengal crisis, ultimately, it got resolved because India

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:52.360
[Guest]: conveyed to the British and Americans that if Pakistan did not bring the situation under

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:55.080
[Guest]: control, then our hands will be forced, right?

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:58.640
[Guest]: So in that sense, you still had to get the external and to be completely candid with

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:03.520
[Guest]: you, you know, this might tell you how historians typically tend to choose subjects and so on.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:08.120
[Guest]: My interest in studying the Bengal crisis of 1950, and this book came out of work, which

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:14.040
[Guest]: I did as a doctoral student, actually was shaped by the, you know, 2001 and 2002 crisis

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:17.320
[Guest]: between India and Pakistan, when the Indian Army had been mobilized, and I was myself

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.080
[Guest]: mobilized as part of that mobilization.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:23.680
[Guest]: So when the infantry Yeah, so when I sort of left the army, one of the things I wanted

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:31.320
[Guest]: to study was precisely the role of such coercive use of force and in solving various crises.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:34.160
[Guest]: And I want to go back in time and look at what are the other crises and one of the first

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.560
[Guest]: thing that I stumbled upon was this Bengal crisis, which nobody had studied.

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.880
[Guest]: So that's how I actually sort of picked it up.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.880
[Amit Varma]: So you're right.

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.040
[Amit Varma]: So we're all sort of lucky, I guess, that you were in the infantry.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:47.400
[Amit Varma]: So let's kind of go through I mean, before we go in for a break, and then come out on

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:51.120
[Amit Varma]: the other side of the break for Article 370, which is what I'm sure all the listeners are

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.120
[Amit Varma]: waiting for, though, this is also pretty fascinating.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:58.560
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of then go through the 1953 period, when you know, in the meantime, what seems

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:04.400
[Amit Varma]: to happen is that you describe the assassination of Liaquat as one of those happenstance moments,

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:10.400
[Amit Varma]: which kind of, you know, the cauldron from just burning, you know, just simmers after

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.880
[Amit Varma]: that, basically.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:15.120
[Amit Varma]: And then we kind of reach a status quo, which exists for a long time.

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.920
[Guest]: Tell me about that process.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:23.920
[Guest]: So again, you know, in 1950, India and Pakistan were almost at war over this Bengal crisis.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.160
[Guest]: And in 1951, once again, there is a standoff over Kashmir.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:32.440
[Guest]: And this time, the concern on the Indian side was that the Pakistanis they get intelligence

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:37.000
[Guest]: reason Pakistanis are planning another sort of quick attack in Kashmir, just around the

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.280
[Guest]: time when the Kashmir Constituent Assembly was getting down to work.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:43.720
[Guest]: And they believe that they want to do that in order to disrupt that process.

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:47.960
[Guest]: And the Indians once again mobilized the Indian army now against West Pakistan, to say that

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:51.720
[Guest]: if you are going to sort of, you know, attack Kashmir or anything like that, then you know,

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:52.720
[Guest]: we are good.

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:55.440
[Guest]: So it that crisis again, plays out for a while.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.040
[Guest]: And Liaquat Ali Khan, who's the Prime Minister of Pakistan at that point of time, in fact,

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:03.960
[Guest]: is assassinated at the height of the crisis by a Pakistani sort of an Afghan assassin,

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.080
[Guest]: who was a Pashtun.

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.840
[Amit Varma]: And it's never quite clear why he was assassinated.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.440
[Amit Varma]: He's killed by the crowd immediately.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:13.120
[Guest]: So it's one of those things which remains unanswered even to date.

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.720
[Guest]: But I think it's an important moment in the evolution of Pakistan's own history.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:21.680
[Guest]: Because you know, the reality of Pakistan was that Muhammad Ali Jinnah died in 1948.

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:25.280
[Guest]: Three years later, Liaquat Ali Khan, who was the second most important leader in that country

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.280
[Guest]: died.

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:31.760
[Guest]: And that in a sense, unmoored the sort of government and the constitution making process

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.360
[Guest]: and made things a lot more difficult, you know, when when you lose two very important

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.120
[Guest]: leaders in succession, just think that if India had lost, not just Sardar Patel, but

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.080
[Guest]: Jawaharlal Nehru in 1951, maybe, you know, things would have been very different, right?

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:48.280
[Guest]: So it's it's in that context that, you know, I was suggesting that Liaquat's assassination

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.480
[Guest]: was a very important moment.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:58.000
[Guest]: But it was also an important moment, in the sense that it made the Kashmir issue a lot

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.080
[Guest]: more complicated to resolve, because there were no sort of, you know, serious leadership

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.120
[Amit Varma]: on the Pakistani side to be able to take over.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:07.040
[Amit Varma]: And they were worried for a while that some random crazies might take over.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.040
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.040
[Guest]: Right.

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.360
[Guest]: I mean, it was just not clear what is going to happen, and so on.

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:16.440
[Guest]: But in all of this context is what then the subsequent moves between New Delhi and Srinagar

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.440
[Guest]: really play out.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:20.920
[Guest]: But I think, you know, before we get into that, we should just wind back in time and

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:26.000
[Guest]: talk a little bit about how exactly that relationship shaped up from 1947 onwards.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.640
[Amit Varma]: So, let's take a quick commercial break.

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:33.040
[Amit Varma]: And we'll come back after the break, talk about that relationship since 1947 and Article

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.040
[Amit Varma]: 370.

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:39.480

[Unknown]: And with that, let's get you back onto your show.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:32.720
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen, I'm chatting with Srinath Raghavan about

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:39.760
[Amit Varma]: Kashmir and Article 370 and we've been speaking about Kashmir and Junagadh and Hyderabad and

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:45.280
[Amit Varma]: Bengal and Sardar Patel and Hindu Nationalists for more than an hour, but finally we have

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.920
[Amit Varma]: got to 370.

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:52.520
[Amit Varma]: Now tell me if my summation of how 370 kind of came about is broadly correct, so we get

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:53.980
[Amit Varma]: to the subject.

01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:59.400
[Amit Varma]: In 1947, there was a thing called the Indian Independence Act, which empowered the Governor

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:04.520
[Amit Varma]: General of India, which was then Lord Mountbatten to adapt the Government of India Act 1935

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:10.200
[Amit Varma]: as an interim constitution, and then to negotiate with princely states on how they would accede

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:15.160
[Amit Varma]: to India, which as you pointed out, VP Menon, who was one of the drivers of that working

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:19.040
[Amit Varma]: with Sardar Patel put together this basic thing that okay, we'll look after defence

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:23.120
[Amit Varma]: and foreign affairs and communications for you and blah, blah, blah.

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:29.840
[Amit Varma]: And Kashmir signed an instrument of accession in October 1947, where basically the caveat

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:34.200
[Amit Varma]: was that this is provisional till the will of the people can be ascertained and Sheikh

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:40.800
[Amit Varma]: Abdullah was then called to the Constituent Assembly and Article 370 was then formulated

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:45.160
[Amit Varma]: and though Article 370 as people point out correctly exists since the constitution does

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.240
[Amit Varma]: in 1950.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:52.360
[Amit Varma]: It basically formalized what the instrument of accession signed in 1947 already does.

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.200
[Amit Varma]: Is that a correct summation?

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.000
[Guest]: Yes, broadly.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.680
[Guest]: The only thing I would say is that, you know, when Sheikh Abdullah was and his colleagues

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:05.640
[Guest]: were asked to sort of join the Indian Constituent Assembly, part of the thing you wanted to

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:12.080
[Guest]: do was to formalize the relationship of Kashmir with the Union of India and to ensure that

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.640
[Guest]: the Indian Constitution reflected it because what had happened previously was an instrument

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.040
[Guest]: of accession, which had been signed by the Maharaja and, you know, accepted by the Government

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:24.520
[Guest]: of India, but you wanted to sort of make sure that the Constitution of India as it takes

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.680
[Guest]: shape will reflect this relationship.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:34.160
[Guest]: Now the negotiations, which led to ultimately the creation of Article 370, it was actually

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:40.520
[Guest]: called 306A in the draft of the constitution, basically stretched out over five months because

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:47.080
[Guest]: what Sheikh Abdullah and his team wanted was to ensure that Kashmir will continue to have

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:51.440
[Guest]: considerable autonomy because it is only on that condition that he might be able to persuade

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:55.240
[Guest]: his people that it was better to join India than to join Pakistan.

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:58.960
[Guest]: And we've already discussed his incentives, all the considerations in front of him.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:05.280
[Guest]: So the way in which Article 370 eventually sort of came up was that it says that the

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:09.240
[Guest]: Government of India is empowered to legislate for the state of Jammu and Kashmir on the

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.400
[Guest]: three subjects of accession.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:17.680
[Guest]: If it wants to sort of extend any further provisions of the Indian constitution to that

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.280
[Guest]: state, then Article 370 is the vehicle through which those provisions can be extended to

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:26.600
[Guest]: the constitution of and made applicable to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:30.920
[Guest]: But here there are a series of caveats which are built in, which is what safeguard the

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.960
[Guest]: autonomy of the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:37.320
[Guest]: The first caveat is to say that if the President of India issues a presidential order under

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:41.640
[Guest]: Article 370, you know, extending any provisions which pertain to the three subjects already

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:47.440
[Guest]: occurred, he only needs the sort of concurrence of the state government, right?

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:53.800
[Guest]: If he wants to sort of extend any other provisions of the Indian constitution to that state,

01:27:53.800 --> 01:28:01.200
[Guest]: then it will need not just a sort of a straightforward concurrence, but a subsequent approval by

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:05.200
[Guest]: the constituent assembly of the JNK state itself.

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:10.920
[Guest]: So in a sense, the ultimate body which decided which other provisions of the Indian constitution

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:15.360
[Guest]: beyond the three things reflected in the instrument of accession would be applicable to the state

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:18.780
[Guest]: of JNK would be the state's own constituent assembly.

01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:22.740
[Guest]: It is in that sense that self-determination was offered to the Kashmiris and autonomy

01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:24.440
[Guest]: was guaranteed to them.

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:29.800
[Guest]: Because the Indian Union could not unilaterally sort of extend provisions using Article 370,

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:35.280
[Guest]: but you had to get the state's constituent assembly to ratify and accept those provisions.

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:40.200
[Guest]: And the assumption was that once the state's constituent assembly completed its task of

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:43.840
[Guest]: making the constitution of the state, it would spell out which of the provisions of the Indian

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.080
[Guest]: constitution it wants to accept.

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.960
[Guest]: And thereafter, no further provisions will be applicable to the state.

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.160
[Guest]: It is in that sense that Article 370 is referred to as temporary provisions for the state of

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:55.160
[Guest]: JNK.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:00.000
[Guest]: The idea was not that you would remove Article 370 and make it permanent, but that the permanent

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.420
[Guest]: contours would only emerge once the state's constituent assembly met, framed the constitution

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:10.000
[Guest]: of the state and decided what parts of the Indian constitution are we willing to accept.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.040
[Guest]: So this was the provision for autonomy and a form of sort of self-determination for the

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:19.740
[Guest]: Kashmiri people, because it was their constituent assembly, which would decide what beyond the

01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:22.840
[Guest]: three subjects they would accept as far as the relationship with India was concerned.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:27.040
[Amit Varma]: Right, so to kind of sum it up and tell me if I've done it correctly, again, I'll quote

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:33.680
[Amit Varma]: Gulzari Nanda, where he talks about 370, where he said in the 60s, quote, the only way of

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:37.600
[Amit Varma]: taking the constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir is through the application of

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:38.600
[Amit Varma]: Article 370.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:40.000
[Amit Varma]: It is a tunnel.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:45.680
[Amit Varma]: It is through this tunnel that a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will,

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.680
[Amit Varma]: stop quote.

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:50.720
[Amit Varma]: And as you're pointing out, where India had jurisdiction as far as the state of Jammu

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:55.560
[Amit Varma]: and Kashmir is concerned is the three subjects of defense, foreign affairs and communication.

01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:00.960
[Amit Varma]: Anything else would need the approval of the state government and the constituent assembly.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:05.960
[Amit Varma]: And the constituent assembly, by the time it wound up, which it did deliberately where

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:11.960
[Amit Varma]: it announced that on so and so a date, I think 1957, 56, you know, by the time it wound up,

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:16.440
[Amit Varma]: the lines that it would have demarcated would remain forever.

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:23.800
[Amit Varma]: And also that any change in Article 370 would have to happen with the agreement of the Constituent

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:28.960
[Amit Varma]: Assembly of J&K, which basically means that by the time it has ceased to exist, no further

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.080
[Amit Varma]: change can happen.

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:36.720
[Amit Varma]: And Article 370, therefore, is supposed to be sort of permanent at this point in time.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:41.740
[Amit Varma]: Now, this is kind of complicated because again, there's a quote I picked up from A. G. Noorani's

01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:48.120
[Amit Varma]: book on Article 370, where he quotes, Nehru is saying that Article 370, quote, has been

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:53.620
[Amit Varma]: eroded, this is Nehru speaking, has been eroded, if I may use the word, and many things have

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:57.240
[Amit Varma]: been done in the last few years, which have made the relationship of Kashmir with the

01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:59.280
[Amit Varma]: Union of India very close.

01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:03.780
[Amit Varma]: There is no doubt that Kashmir is fully integrated, stop quote.

01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:08.540
[Amit Varma]: And I was struggling to kind of make sense of this, both in terms of what he meant by

01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:14.060
[Amit Varma]: eroded, and what, you know, defenders of the current move say that Nehru himself through

01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:20.880
[Amit Varma]: a series of presidential orders essentially made 370 almost irrelevant.

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:25.540
[Amit Varma]: And also, I'm not sure what Nehru meant by Kashmir being fully integrated.

01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:27.060
[Guest]: So the first thing is this, right.

01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:30.080
[Guest]: And that is where I think we need to get to the grips with the history of what happens

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:33.060
[Guest]: to Article 370 after it is embodied in the Constitution, right?

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:36.620
[Guest]: Because by the time you come to Gulzarilal Nanda, a lot of water has flowed in the Jhelum

01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:39.220
[Guest]: under the bridges of, you know, JNK.

01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:45.180
[Guest]: Now, Article 370 is adopted as part of the Indian Constitution in 1950, 26th of January

01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:47.780
[Guest]: 1950, the Constitution comes into effect.

01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:54.780
[Guest]: Now, by the end of 1950, the JNK State Constituent Assembly is getting ready to come together

01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:56.840
[Guest]: to form the Constitution of the state.

01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:00.380
[Guest]: And as we know, that is going to be the ultimate body which will decide what provisions of

01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:03.580
[Guest]: the Indian Constitution beyond the three subjects would be acceptable.

01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:09.700
[Guest]: Now even as the JNK State Constituent Assembly starts meeting, Sheikh Abdullah is a little

01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.780
[Guest]: impatient to change some aspects of the status quo.

01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:16.860
[Guest]: In particular, he wants to dislodge the Maharaja of Kashmir as the hereditary ruler of the

01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:17.860
[Guest]: state.

01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:19.920
[Guest]: He has a long standing problem with the Maharaja.

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:25.580
[Guest]: So what he presses upon Nehru is to say that, why don't you issue a presidential order under

01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:32.820
[Guest]: Article 370, effectively saying that the Maharaja's position will be taken over by an elected

01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:40.420
[Guest]: Sadre Riyasat, who will be Maharaja's son, Dr. Karan Singh would take over that position

01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:41.460
[Guest]: and so on.

01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:46.780
[Guest]: It is in that context, actually, that Nehru and Sheikh Abdullah get into a protracted

01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:51.700
[Guest]: correspondence because Nehru says that, you know, the Maharaja of Kashmir is actually

01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:54.480
[Guest]: recognized by the President of India in the Indian Constitution.

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:59.660
[Guest]: So if you want to do away with him, then we have to at least broadly decide what the contours

01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:06.020
[Guest]: of the relationship between India and Srinagar should be, or, you know, between New Delhi

01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:09.860
[Guest]: and Srinagar should be, which actually is a task which is left to the Constituent Assembly.

01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:13.180
[Guest]: But he says, we must accept some guidelines, which is then your responsibility to make

01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:17.960
[Guest]: sure the Constituent Assembly fleshes it out and gives effects to that understanding.

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:21.980
[Guest]: Because you are asking for changes even before the Constituent Assembly has started its business.

01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:26.100
[Guest]: So if we have to, if we want to, I can't do this piecemeal because this will have implications

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.100
[Guest]: constitutionally.

01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:29.520
[Guest]: So we have to do a few other things.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:33.540
[Guest]: So it is in that context that as part of negotiations between the two sides, they come to something

01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:40.100
[Guest]: called a Delhi Agreement of 1952, whereby the two sides try and align their positions

01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:45.460
[Guest]: on what the autonomy of JNK will mean as far as accepting various provisions of the Indian

01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:46.460
[Guest]: Constitution or not.

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:49.540
[Guest]: They don't get into very great detail, but they say what are broadly the kinds of things

01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:50.540
[Guest]: that will be acceptable, right?

01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:54.500
[Guest]: Like, so for instance, you know, the idea that JNK state will have its own flag, you

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.460
[Guest]: know, it is going to have, you know, various kinds of things, right?

01:33:57.460 --> 01:34:00.740
[Guest]: So that is what the 1952 agreement really is about.

01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:07.700
[Guest]: And the 1952 agreement, at least as far as Jawaharlal Nehru is concerned, enables a synchronization

01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:12.540
[Guest]: of the constitutions of India and the future constitution of JNK.

01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:16.500
[Guest]: It lays down certain markers that both sides will agree when they are thinking about this

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:18.660
[Guest]: relationship, right?

01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:21.300
[Guest]: But Sheikh Abdullah has two problems.

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:25.380
[Guest]: First, the agreement actually does not go down all that well in Srinagar.

01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:30.540
[Guest]: Because people believe that Sheikh Abdullah has somewhat preemptively undermined the autonomous

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:33.020
[Guest]: authority of the Constituent Assembly of JNK.

01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:36.680
[Guest]: And that he has somehow sort of, you know, indulged in a bit of a sell off to this thing.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:39.420
[Guest]: And this is against the context when plebiscite is still a possibility, many other things

01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:40.420
[Guest]: are in the air, right?

01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:42.740
[Guest]: UN is still hotly debating this issue.

01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:44.020
[Guest]: So that's the problem.

01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:49.460
[Guest]: The second problem for Sheikh Abdullah is that the Janasang and Shama Prasad Mukherjee

01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:52.620
[Guest]: take the Delhi agreement as a major target.

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:58.940
[Guest]: But in order to this, right, and the slogan of the time was that, ek desh mein doh vidhan,

01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:01.340
[Guest]: doh nishan, doh pradhan, right?

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:07.820
[Guest]: Two constitutions, two flags, and two sort of rulers, Sadr-e-Riyasat as well as the president

01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:08.820
[Guest]: should not be.

01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:09.820
[Guest]: Nahi chalega, nahi chalega.

01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:10.820
[Guest]: Right?

01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:11.820
[Guest]: That was the thing.

01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:14.140
[Guest]: So they really targeted the 1952 accord.

01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:19.500
[Guest]: And Sheikh Abdullah thereafter became very, very worried about whether India will actually

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:23.020
[Guest]: be able to sort of guarantee Kashmir's autonomy in perpetuity.

01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:26.260
[Guest]: Or are these forces of the Hindu right really going to come?

01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:29.260
[Guest]: And it's in that context that you know, actually Jawaharlal Nehru writes letters and makes

01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:30.260
[Guest]: speeches.

01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:34.580
[Guest]: He says, why should the Kashmiris be part of India, if the Janasang and RSS are going

01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:36.300
[Guest]: to be in the driver's seat?

01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:38.700
[Guest]: Because they know very well that these guys are going to erode any autonomy that is left

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:39.700
[Amit Varma]: there.

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:40.700
[Amit Varma]: Right?

01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:43.500
[Amit Varma]: And the Hindu right is not just from India, it's also the Praja Parishad in Jammu, like

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.660
[Guest]: you pointed out, which is doing a lot of stuff there.

01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:50.460
[Guest]: By now, they have been sort of co-opted into this thing, right? and there are other elements

01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:55.700
[Guest]: like the Sadr Ariyasat himself, who's a former ruler's son, Dr. Karan Singh, who has conflicted

01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:56.700
[Guest]: views about various things.

01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:57.700
[Guest]: Right?

01:35:57.700 --> 01:36:00.980
[Guest]: I mean, he presents everything as if the people of Jammu have different aspirations that are

01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:01.980
[Guest]: different.

01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:03.460
[Guest]: But he's also a factor in this game.

01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:08.300
[Guest]: And there is a third factor, which is a group of influential sort of Kashmiri pandits, who

01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:13.020
[Guest]: are associates of Sheikh Abdullah, but eventually then start doubting Sheikh Abdullah's own

01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:14.020
[Guest]: motives.

01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:19.100
[Guest]: There is a man who would later became a very influential player in under Mrs. Indira Gandhi

01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:20.100
[Guest]: called D.P.

01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.100
[Guest]: Dhar.

01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:22.100
[Guest]: D.P.

01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:24.100
[Amit Varma]: Dhar became India's ambassador to the Soviet Union during the 1971 crisis.

01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:26.100
[Amit Varma]: Entirely discussed him in our Bangladesh episode.

01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:27.100
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:28.100
[Guest]: So everything comes together.

01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:32.020
[Guest]: You can see how some of these characters have never let go of me for the last 15 years.

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.020
[Guest]: Right?

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.020
[Guest]: So D.P.

01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:35.020
[Guest]: Dhar was one of those people.

01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:43.580
[Guest]: And it is this group of people, which is the Sadr Ariyasat Karan Singh, some of Sheikh Abdullah's

01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:47.460
[Guest]: own associates, including others, and this is not a Hindu Muslim thing, right?

01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:49.460
[Guest]: I mean, there are some like D.P.

01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:53.780
[Guest]: Dhar, but there are others like, you know, Bakshri Ghulam Muhammad, who is effectively

01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:58.260
[Guest]: number two, who believe that the line that Abdullah is now sort of treading, which is

01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:02.860
[Guest]: to say, listen, let's look for some kind of a different status for Kashmir, which we discussed,

01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:03.860
[Guest]: right?

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:07.020
[Guest]: He wanted some kind of an agreement between India and Pakistan, guaranteeing some kind

01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:10.860
[Guest]: of independent status for Kashmir, etc, etc, was the wrong thing to do.

01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:11.860
[Guest]: Right?

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:14.580
[Guest]: And Abdullah, of course, is reacting to these two things.

01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:18.980
[Guest]: One to the unpopularity of the Delhi Agreement within his own thing, second to the attack

01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:24.380
[Guest]: on the Delhi Agreement being mounted by the Janasangh and others sort of, you know, approving

01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:25.380
[Guest]: of that.

01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:29.020
[Guest]: And then, of course, Shama Prasad Mukherjee dies in a sort of a jail in Srinagar.

01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:30.020
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:32.860
[Guest]: Post all of that, Sheikh Abdullah then becomes very nervous and starts making all of these

01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:33.860
[Guest]: different kinds of moves.

01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:38.300
[Guest]: He starts meeting the American ambassador, Nehru through his intelligence agencies, gets

01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:42.220
[Guest]: to know influential people like Karan Singh and D.P.

01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:46.940
[Guest]: Dhar and Bakshi Ghulam Muhammad are plotting behind the scenes to prepare the way for Sheikh

01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:48.620
[Guest]: Abdullah's departure.

01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:52.060
[Guest]: They convinced Jawaharlal Nehru that Abdullah has to be gotten rid of.

01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:57.340
[Guest]: Yeah, there is actually a very, very interesting letter, which I found much later in the archives

01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:58.340
[Guest]: of P.N.

01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:00.820
[Guest]: Haksar, who was Mrs. Gandhi's principal secretary.

01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:01.820
[Guest]: Another Bangladesh protagonist.

01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:03.860
[Guest]: Another Bangladesh protagonist.

01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:04.860
[Guest]: This is from 1972.

01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:05.860
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:10.820
[Guest]: This is in the context of what later became the Simla Accords and stuff.

01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:14.820
[Guest]: And Haksar at that point of time is a great advocate of some kind of rapprochement with

01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:15.820
[Guest]: Sheikh Abdullah.

01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:18.940
[Guest]: You know, this is, we're talking about 20 years fast forwarding.

01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:21.820
[Guest]: And he says that, I met D.P.

01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:26.180
[Guest]: Dhar the other day, and I told him that since he was responsible for the original sin in

01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:30.140
[Guest]: Kashmir, maybe he should take the first step to reach out to Sheikh Abdullah.

01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:33.860
[Guest]: And the original sin was the imprisonment and arbitrary dismissal of Sheikh Abdullah

01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:41.900
[Guest]: in 1953, which frankly was one of those things which led to a, which created a rupture in

01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:46.580
[Guest]: the minds of the Muslims of Kashmir valley in particular, because it was seen by them

01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:51.260
[Guest]: and remains, continues to be seen by them as an enormous historical betrayal of India's

01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:55.620
[Guest]: promise of autonomy to Kashmir because their tallest leader, the person who was sort of

01:38:55.620 --> 01:39:00.420
[Guest]: negotiating was arbitrarily removed, arrested and put in prison.

01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:03.100
[Guest]: Subsequently various kinds of charges were foisted on him, none of which were sort of

01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:06.860
[Guest]: proven in a court of law, but he remained in and out of prisons for a very, very long

01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:07.860
[Guest]: period of time.

01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:12.700
[Guest]: And I think that sort of ruptured and Nehru himself knew that he was taking a very dangerous

01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:20.620
[Guest]: move in sort of dismissing Sheikh Abdullah, but he, against his better judgment allowed

01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:23.260
[Guest]: himself to sort of go ahead and do that.

01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:26.300
[Guest]: And he was instrumental in that, even though he kept insisting that it was done by the

01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:29.180
[Guest]: people on the ground, but historical records suggest otherwise.

01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:34.260
[Guest]: Sheikh Lala Nehru was totally in sync with this plan to remove Sheikh Abdullah.

01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:38.540
[Guest]: In fact, he dictates a note to his secretary, Emma Mothai, saying, what are the various

01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:42.020
[Guest]: steps which have to be taken to ensure that public order is maintained after Abdullah

01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:43.020
[Guest]: is removed?

01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:44.020
[Guest]: How does he justify it to himself?

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:45.020
[Guest]: Realpolitik, I suppose, right?

01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:50.980
[Guest]: I mean, see, when you are in these positions of power, you have certain kinds of principles,

01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:55.060
[Guest]: you have this extraordinary friendship with Sheikh Abdullah, you know, various things,

01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:58.300
[Guest]: but you just feel like, listen, if I don't act at this point of time in this way, then

01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:00.220
[Guest]: maybe the state is going to get out of my control.

01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:05.480
[Guest]: And I who have been a great champion and votary of Kashmir being a symbol of India secularism

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:10.740
[Guest]: will then have failed in not just persuading my countrymen to accept it, but in keeping

01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:11.740
[Guest]: them in our fold.

01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:12.740
[Guest]: Right?

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:15.780
[Guest]: So it's one of those ruthless realpolitik decisions which is taken.

01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:20.980
[Guest]: And I think it looks at least as bad in retrospect as it did in prospect.

01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:25.660
[Guest]: And I think history has vindicated it to be the single most grievous error made by India

01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:27.500
[Guest]: in its dealings with JNK.

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:32.460
[Guest]: I think everything else could have sort of possibly worked out in India's favor, had

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:38.140
[Guest]: this move to depose Sheikh Abdullah in such an arbitrary and, you know, unlawful illegal

01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:40.260
[Guest]: manner not been taken.

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:43.340
[Guest]: And it's also worth pointing out that immediately after the arrest of Sheikh Abdullah, there

01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:45.100
[Guest]: were popular protests in Kashmir.

01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:49.140
[Guest]: And many people were shot and killed in putting down those protests.

01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:52.100
[Guest]: It is again because of a news blackout is not something that is reported in mainstream

01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:54.660
[Guest]: newspapers of the time, but it's well known.

01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:58.260
[Amit Varma]: So what, what were the repercussions of this, like, I don't want to bother you with another

01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:02.460
[Amit Varma]: complex counterfactual, but just a sort of a simpler counterfactual question that if

01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:05.460
[Amit Varma]: Nehru hadn't done this, what would the best case scenario have been?

01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:08.900
[Guest]: Well, the best case scenario would have been to sort of try and persuade Sheikh Abdullah

01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:14.700
[Guest]: to sort of, you know, come up with some other kind of an arrangement which would allow him

01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:17.700
[Guest]: to sell autonomy to his own people in a strong way.

01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:18.700
[Guest]: Because what was Abdullah's problem?

01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:23.940
[Guest]: Abdullah's problem was that he believed that in the wake of the rise of the Dhansangh and

01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:27.620
[Guest]: these kinds of protests, and you know, they had various kinds of rallies, marches, especially

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:28.620
[Guest]: all of North India.

01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:29.620
[Guest]: Right.

01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:32.100
[Guest]: He just felt like, you know, it is going to be impossible for me to convince Kashmiri

01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:35.980
[Guest]: Muslims that their future in an autonomous fashion is somehow safe in an India of the

01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:36.980
[Guest]: sky.

01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:38.900
[Guest]: So in a sense, it would have taken a lot.

01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:41.260
[Guest]: And maybe Jawaharlal Nehru would have also had to think out creatively.

01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:49.140
[Guest]: And again, he did in 1964 on the sort of on literally on his deathbed, Jawaharlal Nehru

01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:53.340
[Guest]: attempted to sort of reach out to Sheikh Abdullah, even sent Sheikh Abdullah to Pakistan to say,

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:55.060
[Guest]: you try and explore some settlement, right?

01:41:55.060 --> 01:42:00.340
[Guest]: Because by that time, 11 years after that act of 1953, Jawaharlal Nehru was living to

01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:01.740
[Guest]: review the day.

01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:07.180
[Guest]: Because in essence, what he realized by the time he died was that the Kashmir issue, far

01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:13.260
[Guest]: from securing India's secularism, had actually created a huge weapon for Hindu majoritarianism

01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:17.500
[Guest]: in this country, because that state's special status could be turned as a weapon against

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.740
[Guest]: Muslims, which is exactly what was happening.

01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:24.260
[Guest]: Jawaharlal Nehru lived to see the consequences of this, realized that at least if in my lifetime,

01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:28.100
[Guest]: I do not make one attempt, it is not very clear what he could have done at that point

01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:29.100
[Guest]: of time.

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:31.700
[Guest]: He was old, weak, ailing.

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:34.300
[Guest]: And it is not very clear that anything would have come out of that.

01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:38.740
[Guest]: But the mere fact that he did it, I think, was the best gesture of repentance that he

01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:42.500
[Guest]: could have bought himself to do, which was to sort of reach out to a man whom he had

01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:47.380
[Guest]: imprisoned and said that, listen, you go to Pakistan, you try what can be tried.

01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:51.360
[Guest]: In fact, that episode is very well covered in Ramachandra Guha's book, India after Gandhi.

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:56.420
[Guest]: But I think, you know, it came too little too late in the day.

01:42:56.420 --> 01:43:00.180
[Amit Varma]: So the, you know, what Nehru did, the one of the political repercussions of that, of

01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:03.500
[Amit Varma]: course, which we are feeling to the present day is that it became one of the central causes

01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:06.200
[Amit Varma]: for the Hindutva right.

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:09.660
[Amit Varma]: What were the repercussions of it for Kashmir and for Kashmiris?

01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:12.520
[Guest]: Well, the important repercussions and that is the point, right?

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:17.400
[Guest]: It is after Sheikh Abdullah's dismissal that Article 370, rather than becoming the guarantee

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:22.620
[Guest]: of Kashmir's autonomy, becomes the instrument through which the will of the central government

01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:24.920
[Guest]: is arbitrarily imposed on the state.

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:30.540
[Guest]: Because the first important, big, you know, mega presidential order is given as early

01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:31.540
[Guest]: as 1954.

01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:34.900
[Guest]: Now, you could say that, you know, the Kashmir Constituent Assembly is still meeting at that

01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:35.900
[Guest]: point of time.

01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:39.540
[Guest]: So maybe exporting all those provisions was something that they agreed the Kashmir Constituent

01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:40.820
[Guest]: Assembly ratified it.

01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:47.740
[Guest]: Yeah, so you can say that at least that notion of the letter of the law was at least followed.

01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:55.020
[Guest]: But post the meeting, dissolution, promulgation of the constitution of JNK, there is no way

01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:59.420
[Guest]: that further provisions of the Indian constitution could be imported to the state under Article

01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:00.420
[Guest]: 370.

01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:02.500
[Guest]: But that is exactly what was done.

01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:06.180
[Guest]: And that is what Jawaharlal Nehru is referring to when he says that more and more things

01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:08.380
[Guest]: have been done to integrate the state closer with India.

01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:11.060
[Amit Varma]: And he uses the word eroded repeatedly.

01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:15.300
[Guest]: It is better in the actual parliamentary debate, because he said it in Hindi.

01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:18.160
[Guest]: He said, ye ghiste ghiste ghis jayega.

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.820
[Guest]: Then why is it still an issue?

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:24.420
[Guest]: It is only an issue because it became an ideological issue for the Janasan and subsequently for

01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:25.640
[Guest]: the BJP.

01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:32.580
[Guest]: Because the reality is that as of 5th August 2019, when Article 370 was totally hollowed

01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:34.860
[Guest]: out, it is still on the papers of the constitution, right?

01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:38.220
[Guest]: It's not gone because taking it out would have other repercussions.

01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:40.180
[Guest]: But it was a dead letter.

01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:44.180
[Guest]: You could do things to that state through Article 370, which you could not do to any

01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:45.220
[Guest]: other state of India.

01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:48.380
[Guest]: Like imposing president's rule for a very long period between 1990 and 1996 through

01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:51.060
[Guest]: a series of presidential orders, we kept imposing.

01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:53.820
[Guest]: You try imposing president rule on any other thing, you need to amend the Indian constitution

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:54.820
[Guest]: to do that.

01:44:54.820 --> 01:44:55.860
[Guest]: You don't need to do that with JNK.

01:44:55.860 --> 01:45:00.460
[Guest]: So far from being the protector, the shield which protect the economy, it became as Gulzari

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:04.980
[Guest]: Lal Nanda said, a tunnel through which everything could be done to that state, irrespective

01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:09.300
[Guest]: of what the wishes of the people were, well, well after the Constituent Assembly of that

01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:11.380
[Amit Varma]: state had dissolved.

01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:17.340
[Amit Varma]: So what was done on August 5, therefore, is really something which is big for the Hindutva,

01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:18.340
[Amit Varma]: right?

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:21.780
[Amit Varma]: Because of his symbolic value in practical terms, it doesn't really make a difference.

01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:25.620
[Amit Varma]: India can still do whatever the India could still was still doing whatever the hell it

01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:26.620
[Guest]: wanted there.

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:28.060
[Guest]: There are two things, right?

01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:33.740
[Guest]: So one is, yes, it is true that India was doing whatever, you know, in a sense, all

01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:39.860
[Guest]: kinds of provisions of the Indian constitution were being extended to that state on the name

01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:40.860
[Guest]: of this thing.

01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:41.860
[Guest]: Right.

01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:46.300
[Guest]: And the sad bit is that the Indian Supreme Court never took an unequivocal stand on this

01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:47.300
[Guest]: issue.

01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:50.500
[Guest]: There is one important ruling where they said that the Constituent Assembly should be the

01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:51.500
[Guest]: ultimate ratifying authority.

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:55.540
[Guest]: There is another ruling in which they have said that, you know, maybe the state legislature

01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:56.540
[Guest]: can support it.

01:45:56.540 --> 01:45:59.380
[Guest]: But what today is happening is that we are being told that the governor can stand in

01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:00.380
[Guest]: even for the state legislature.

01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:05.380
[Guest]: You're taking the reductio ad absurdum of that argument that a Constituent Assembly,

01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:10.060
[Guest]: which is a sovereign body, which has in any scheme of politics, greater powers than a

01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:15.140
[Guest]: normal elected legislative assembly today can be said to be equivalent to the governor

01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:17.020
[Guest]: of a state which is under President's rule.

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:20.140
[Guest]: Now, that is the extent to which these things have been done.

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:23.940
[Guest]: The second thing which has been of course done under the current move is the reduction

01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:26.780
[Guest]: of the state to a union territory status, which is a very different thing.

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:28.180
[Guest]: I think we should come to that in a bit.

01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:29.180
[Amit Varma]: We'll come to that.

01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:35.700
[Amit Varma]: You know, I'll link to Gautam Bhatia's excellent piece on exactly how the government did the

01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:40.900
[Amit Varma]: constitutional higgery-jiggery-pokery by which it sort of did what it did.

01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:43.780
[Guest]: But can you briefly summarize what exactly it did?

01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:48.340
[Guest]: So the main stumbling block for the government was this provision within Article 370 that

01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:52.820
[Guest]: the extension of any other provisions of the Indian Constitution would have to be ratified

01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:54.780
[Guest]: by the state's Constituent Assembly.

01:46:54.780 --> 01:47:00.180
[Guest]: So what the presidential order which was issued on 5th of August attempts to do is to circumvent

01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:01.620
[Guest]: that through a backdoor.

01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:05.260
[Guest]: They have said that we will amend Article 367, which is the explanations clause of the

01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:12.940
[Guest]: article, to say that for state Constituent Assembly, read state government as advised

01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:14.300
[Guest]: by so and so.

01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:17.700
[Guest]: And they have made a claim that currently there is no state government there and that

01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:19.060
[Guest]: the governor stands in for that.

01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:20.060
[Guest]: Right.

01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:24.680
[Guest]: So it's a backdoor through which now the problem with that, as Gautam points out in his piece,

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:29.060
[Guest]: is that in effect, what they have done is they have used Article 370 to amend Article

01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:31.940
[Guest]: 370 itself, which is highly problematic.

01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:35.420
[Guest]: You cannot use any of the provisions of the Constitution to amend itself.

01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.940
[Guest]: You have to invoke the amendment powers of the Constitution.

01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:42.940
[Amit Varma]: Remind me to ask you about Sikkim in 1975, which is a very, I think that's a total rabbit

01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:43.940
[Guest]: hole.

01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:46.340
[Guest]: Anyway, so, so that is the first thing, right?

01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:50.020
[Guest]: So they've done things in an indirect way.

01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:54.660
[Guest]: But that is likely to raise a series of constitutional sort of questions, which the courts will have

01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:57.420
[Guest]: to sort of decide on whether that is happening.

01:47:57.420 --> 01:48:03.140
[Guest]: There is a second problem vis-a-vis how they have sort of gone about doing this, right,

01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:07.700
[Guest]: which is to say that the first presidential order that was issued that way, the same day,

01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:12.220
[Guest]: the Home Minister tabled another presidential order to get the Parliament's approval, which

01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:17.980
[Guest]: basically said that from here on, every other article barring Article, you know, Clause

01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:21.060
[Guest]: 1 of 370 stands is to be taken away.

01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:25.180
[Guest]: Clause 1 will now say that every article of the Indian Constitution, irrespective of anything

01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:27.220
[Guest]: ever done will apply, right?

01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:31.900
[Guest]: So it's a dramatic wholesale change of Article 370 itself.

01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:38.860
[Guest]: Now that falls into another problem because the original Article 370 states specifically

01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:44.540
[Guest]: that Article 1 of the Indian Constitution and Article 370 applied to the state of Jammu

01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:45.820
[Guest]: and Kashmir.

01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:50.000
[Guest]: If any other provisions of the Constitution have to be applied, then you can use a presidential

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:55.180
[Guest]: order, which only means to say that you cannot extend Article 370 to that state again in

01:48:55.180 --> 01:48:57.580
[Guest]: a new form through a presidential order.

01:48:57.580 --> 01:49:01.540
[Guest]: Now, this is the reason why it took five months to draft that article.

01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:05.620
[Guest]: It is not as if these kind of ideas have been come up with a bunch of geniuses or that could

01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:07.660
[Guest]: not have been anticipated at that time.

01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:10.800
[Guest]: It is very easily foreseeable that a group of people could have destroyed the autonomy

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:15.660
[Guest]: of the state using Article 370 if these safeguards were not in place, which is why Sheikh Abdullah

01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:20.020
[Guest]: negotiated for five months and bought all of these provisions in.

01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:24.900
[Guest]: And despite that, NG Iyengar has explained all of these provisions in his sort of speech

01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:28.300
[Guest]: in the Constituent Assembly where he tables the article to say this is the provision.

01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:31.420
[Guest]: These are the reasons why we are doing all of these things, right?

01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:36.620
[Guest]: So in effect, I think, therefore, this raises a whole series of sort of constitutional questions

01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:41.900
[Guest]: about the legality of an order like this, which the courts will have to sit on and decide

01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:42.900
[Guest]: and deliberate.

01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:46.320
[Guest]: But I think there's one more thing which is worth wearing out.

01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:49.500
[Guest]: What is the overall consequence of what has been done?

01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:55.140
[Guest]: The overall consequence of what has been done is to nullify the constitution of the state

01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:57.860
[Guest]: of Jammu and Kashmir.

01:49:57.860 --> 01:50:05.260
[Guest]: The position and legitimacy of that constitution was enshrined in the Indian constitution through

01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:07.760
[Guest]: Article 370.

01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:12.060
[Guest]: It was a provision of the Indian constitution to accept that state's constitution.

01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:16.940
[Guest]: Now in effect, we have destroyed that state's constitution wholesale.

01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:21.260
[Guest]: Now what does that mean for the basic structure of the constitution, etc., I think is another

01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:26.180
[Guest]: issue that constitutional lawyers and the courts will be deliberating in the weeks and

01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:27.180
[Amit Varma]: months to come.

01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:29.780
[Amit Varma]: What does it mean for Indian federalism?

01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:34.100
[Guest]: I think that is where the second part of the whole thing becomes much more difficult, right?

01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:37.880
[Guest]: There are two aspects of this question of federalism, which I think we need to deliberate.

01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:42.980
[Guest]: One relates to 370 itself, and the second relates to the union territorial sort of creation

01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:46.420
[Guest]: of two union territories in what was a Nerstwile state.

01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:49.220
[Guest]: Now let's look at 370 itself first.

01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:53.740
[Guest]: 370 is not the only part of the Indian constitution which has such asymmetric provisions.

01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:56.780
[Guest]: If you read Article 370, and there are many other states which have various kinds of asymmetric

01:50:56.780 --> 01:51:00.220
[Guest]: provisions, nor is J&K the only state where you cannot purchase land.

01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:03.540
[Guest]: There are many other states which have similar provisions, particularly with respect to agricultural

01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:04.540
[Guest]: land.

01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:08.060
[Guest]: There are many kinds of ceilings and restrictions about what non-domiciles can and cannot do

01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:09.220
[Guest]: in states, right?

01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:12.020
[Guest]: These are all parts of the federal provisions of the constitution.

01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:17.340
[Guest]: So asymmetric constitutional provisions was a fundamental part of the design of the Indian

01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:21.580
[Guest]: constitution because the Indian constitution has simply understood that if you wanted to

01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:28.580
[Guest]: deal with a country of such diversity of language, caste, region, religion, etc., etc., I mean,

01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:32.060
[Guest]: how are you going to accommodate it if you cannot accommodate for various kinds of diversity?

01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:36.740
[Guest]: So as I said, it was never envisaged to be a federal constitution in the technical sense.

01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:41.620
[Guest]: It was a unitary state, but a state which had these various kinds of asymmetric relations

01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:43.700
[Guest]: with various provinces to capture their specific histories.

01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:45.980
[Guest]: Let me just give you one example.

01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:52.100
[Guest]: You know, when the BJP came back to power in 2014, you know, one of the main sort of

01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:56.520
[Guest]: Markway announcements, which was done, was the announcement that we are going to sign

01:51:56.520 --> 01:52:00.220
[Guest]: an agreement with the Nagas, right, which you may recall, the Prime Minister had sort

01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:03.340
[Guest]: of made that announcement as a signing ceremony and so on.

01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:06.860
[Guest]: And as part of that speech, one of the reasons which she explained why we had to sort of

01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:09.240
[Guest]: do this and what the final agreement would look like.

01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:14.700
[Guest]: He said that final agreement will recognize the special history of the Naga people, right?

01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:16.620
[Guest]: Article 370 did exactly that.

01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:18.740
[Guest]: It recognized the special history of this thing.

01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:23.540
[Guest]: The various asymmetric province parts of the constitution recognize the fact, you know,

01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:29.020
[Guest]: because as a historian, what is striking about India is not that, you know, India is an agglomeration

01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:31.680
[Guest]: of various regions, which came together and decided to become a nation.

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:35.580
[Guest]: It's not like Italy and or like Prussia, which became Germany later.

01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:41.140
[Guest]: The imaginary of the nation and the imaginary of the region in India are both coeval.

01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:43.700
[Guest]: They happen more or less at the same time.

01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:46.500
[Guest]: People feel like I'm part of this region and also part of this nation, right?

01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:51.900
[Guest]: So in a sense, it is that principle which the Indian constitution tried to capture

01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:54.540
[Guest]: by these kinds of various provisions of asymmetry.

01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:59.420
[Guest]: So in a sense, we are going against the grain of our own history and the lay of this land.

01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:02.340
[Guest]: If we are saying that we have to do away with asymmetric provisions, which is why I was

01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:06.660
[Guest]: surprised that, you know, when when the chief minister of Sikkim says that I welcome the

01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:11.140
[Guest]: sort of removal of Article 370, but I'm also assured that my special status or my state

01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:12.140
[Guest]: is going to remain in place.

01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:13.700
[Guest]: I mean, what are the guarantees, right?

01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:17.820
[Guest]: If asymmetry does not apply for one, who can assure it for another in a very different

01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:18.820
[Amit Varma]: context.

01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:23.280
[Amit Varma]: And also, as you pointed out, you know, before we started recording, that there are parties

01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:28.300
[Amit Varma]: like the TDP and the TRS, which would expect them to stand up for federalism and, you know,

01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:32.420
[Amit Varma]: that's practically the raison d'etre, in a sense, and, and yet, they have welcomed this

01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:33.420
[Guest]: move.

01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:37.180
[Guest]: So, so I think, so as far as 370 is concerned, and, you know, I think it raises questions

01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:42.300
[Guest]: about what happens to the future of this kind of asymmetric character of the Indian constitution,

01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:44.140
[Guest]: if it can be eroded in this way.

01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:49.940
[Guest]: The second is about the manner in which the state has been reduced to a union territory,

01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:52.420
[Guest]: you know, bifurcated and reduced to two union territories.

01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:57.420
[Guest]: I think that has very significant consequences and questions it raises about what the nature

01:53:57.420 --> 01:54:01.180
[Guest]: of federalism in this country is going to be going forward, right?

01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:06.100
[Guest]: In the first place, you know, how do you reorganize a province?

01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:08.660
[Guest]: Article three of the Indian constitution lays out what are the things that need to be done.

01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:13.300
[Guest]: And that article three actually had a special requirement for JNK, over and above that of

01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:14.300
[Guest]: every other state.

01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:18.220
[Guest]: For every other state, in order to table a bill for bifurcation of a state, for instance,

01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:22.180
[Guest]: what you needed is a concurrence of the sort of, you know, it had to be tabled before the

01:54:22.180 --> 01:54:23.940
[Guest]: state legislature.

01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:27.860
[Guest]: And then the president could sort of give us approval to be tabled in parliament.

01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:32.540
[Guest]: Whereas with the JNK state, it was specifically laid down under article three, that the concurrence

01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:35.560
[Guest]: of the state legislature had to be gotten before any such thing could be done.

01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:39.660
[Guest]: So it is an additional provision, once again, as part of this extra sort of guarantee of

01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:40.980
[Guest]: autonomy and so on.

01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:42.420
[Guest]: But you've done away with all of that stuff, right?

01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:43.420
[Guest]: Now what have you done?

01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:47.100
[Guest]: You have said basically that we don't even need the concurrence of the state government.

01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:50.840
[Guest]: The president's appointee who is a governor is enough to give concurrence.

01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:51.840
[Guest]: So that is the first thing.

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:57.580
[Guest]: The second thing is that you have said that, you know, you can carve out a state without

01:54:57.580 --> 01:55:02.060
[Guest]: any reference to the visuals of the legislature of that state, without even reference to them,

01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:05.520
[Guest]: forget asking them for approval, just without any reference, you can do it.

01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:08.740
[Guest]: And again, it tells you what are the kinds of things which can be done to a state like

01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:12.380
[Guest]: JNK and article 370, because you cannot do the same thing with any other state.

01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:16.940
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you did it to a state which had so many protections, and therefore you can basically

01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:18.240
[Amit Varma]: So that's the first thing.

01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:24.820
[Guest]: The second thing is about saying that what does it mean politically for any government

01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:31.940
[Guest]: of India to say that, listen, we can impose president's rule on a state and then say that

01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:35.860
[Guest]: the governor's concurrence is sufficient to not just carve out that state, but to reduce

01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:40.880
[Guest]: various parts of the state from statehood to union territory status.

01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:45.060
[Guest]: So tomorrow, you know, hypothetically, we can think about some other ruling party, which

01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:50.420
[Guest]: might be in power, which may decide that in order to take political control of a state,

01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:55.420
[Guest]: which we cannot win elections in, we are just going to wait it out, impose president's rule,

01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:58.860
[Guest]: bring in a bill, carving out that state into a series of union territories, emasculating

01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:00.320
[Guest]: it politically.

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.860
[Guest]: And we are done with the thing.

01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:05.660
[Guest]: I mean, what a change that would mean for Indian democracy and federalism, you can imagine.

01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:09.860
[Guest]: Now, I'm not suggesting that this is going to be replicated, but everything creates some

01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:10.860
[Guest]: precedent.

01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:11.860
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:15.540
[Guest]: So we have to think about what kinds of precedents we are setting for ourselves as a country.

01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:21.300
[Guest]: If we are going to accept that these are sort of legitimate means of doing democratic business.

01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:24.380
[Amit Varma]: And just thinking aloud, I think once you change the rules of the game, you change the

01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:25.380
[Amit Varma]: game.

01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:28.380
[Amit Varma]: Even if you don't apply those rules necessarily, everybody's incentives change.

01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:29.380
[Amit Varma]: Precisely.

01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:36.140
[Amit Varma]: So I have sort of three broader questions, which are all things about which I'm genuinely

01:56:36.140 --> 01:56:37.140
[Amit Varma]: puzzled.

01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:44.620
[Amit Varma]: One, in one case, it is evident that 370 was sort of a compact between the Union of India

01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:46.580
[Amit Varma]: and Jammu and Kashmir.

01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:51.260
[Amit Varma]: And that we have broken this compact by doing what we have done.

01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:55.260
[Amit Varma]: And you could argue that, you know, Nehru himself broke the contact repeatedly.

01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:58.700
[Amit Varma]: And what has happened now is just a formalizing of that.

01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:02.380
[Amit Varma]: But the larger question here is broken the compact with who?

01:57:02.380 --> 01:57:07.420
[Amit Varma]: Because even the original compact wasn't with an elected leaders who represented the will

01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:08.420
[Amit Varma]: of the people.

01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:09.900
[Amit Varma]: We never knew the will of the people.

01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:12.500
[Amit Varma]: I would say we still don't know the will of the people.

01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:15.060
[Amit Varma]: And also the will of the people is not a monolithic thing.

01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:19.340
[Amit Varma]: Not only are there many different kinds of people with different wills, but also over

01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:25.060
[Amit Varma]: a period of time, what the Kashmiri people might want has also changed rapidly, whether

01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:30.780
[Amit Varma]: you're talking about 1955, or you're talking about 75, or you're talking about 1990, after

01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:35.700
[Amit Varma]: everything kind of blows up, or you're talking about 2007, when things were better, and you're

01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:39.500
[Amit Varma]: talking about now when things are really pretty bad.

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:44.660
[Amit Varma]: So the issue is, you know, some people would raise the point, which I have a fair amount

01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:51.900
[Amit Varma]: of sympathy for that the current beleaguered young Kashmiri, who views the Indian government

01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:57.500
[Amit Varma]: as an oppressive foreign power, if he wants to fight for freedom today, he is basically

01:57:57.500 --> 01:58:03.660
[Amit Varma]: not on a lower moral plane than say, a Bhagat Singh or a Chandrashekhar Azad or any of the

01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:10.460
[Amit Varma]: Indian freedom fighters were, you see yourself as a local people fighting this colonial force.

01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:13.780
[Amit Varma]: And the fact is that they have been promised self determination for so many years.

01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:17.540
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, and of course, the meaning of that term has changed for them what self

01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:19.700
[Amit Varma]: determination really means.

01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:24.860
[Amit Varma]: How do we reconcile that question, like so far, we've discussed Kashmir as a geopolitical

01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:29.900
[Amit Varma]: issue between India and Pakistan, and, you know, as a political issue within India, where

01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:32.340
[Amit Varma]: all this other politics is playing out?

01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:37.420
[Amit Varma]: What about the moral question that the people sort of also have a right to decide their

01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:38.420
[Amit Varma]: own destiny?

01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:42.980
[Guest]: Well, I think, at some level, you know, that is the fundamental question, right?

01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:49.300
[Guest]: Which is to say that, is it really possible for any government in any part of the world

01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:54.940
[Guest]: to be able to impose its will on ordinary people over very long periods of time?

01:58:54.940 --> 01:59:00.380
[Guest]: And I think much of modern history suggests that that is unlikely to work in a long term

01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:01.380
[Guest]: context, right?

01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:03.540
[Guest]: You can do it for some lengths of period, you can maybe do it for very long periods

01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:06.300
[Guest]: of time, but unlikely that it's going to continue forever, right?

01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:11.060
[Guest]: I mean, in that sense, there is no permanence to that kind of dominance, and so on.

01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:15.980
[Guest]: Now, as far as Kashmir itself is concerned, see, we have gone through so many sort of

01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:21.860
[Guest]: stages of thinking about how do we refer to the will of the people, almost from the moment

01:59:21.860 --> 01:59:25.940
[Guest]: when this pledge was made that in Junagadh, Hyderabad, Kashmir, we are going to refer

01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:28.740
[Guest]: to the will of the people, you wanted to know what that would be.

01:59:28.740 --> 01:59:30.180
[Guest]: Should it be a referendum?

01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:31.180
[Guest]: Should it be a plebiscite?

01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:33.620
[Guest]: Those are technically somewhat different things.

01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:38.300
[Guest]: Should it be a Indian referendum or an Indian plebiscite or should it be internationally

01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:39.300
[Guest]: supervised?

01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:40.300
[Guest]: Right?

01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:41.300
[Guest]: There was that question.

01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:45.940
[Guest]: Later on, there was this question of saying that is the Constituent Assembly of JNK, which

01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:50.300
[Guest]: we have assured under our constitution, and that constitution is that a form of self-determination?

01:59:50.300 --> 01:59:54.380
[Guest]: Now, you said earlier that, you know, the Kashmiri people themselves were never asked.

01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:57.620
[Guest]: But in a sense, that is broadly true of the Indian constitution also.

01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:01.860
[Guest]: It was elected on a limited franchise, the Constituent Assembly, and the constitution

02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:05.100
[Guest]: was never ratified by the people, though you could think of the first general election

02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:10.700
[Guest]: in 1951 as broadly a ratification of the constitution, but it was not technically not a ratification.

02:00:10.700 --> 02:00:15.580
[Guest]: So my only point is to say that just because that was not done, it does not mean that,

02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:19.020
[Guest]: you know, everything had to be only solved by means of plebiscites and referenda.

02:00:19.020 --> 02:00:20.020
[Guest]: Right?

02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:23.060
[Guest]: I mean, there could have been other ways of sort of doing those things.

02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:28.340
[Guest]: Then we had a constitution coming in, but that constitution has been under article 370

02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:29.340
[Guest]: eroded.

02:00:29.340 --> 02:00:33.260
[Guest]: And, you know, Indian leaders starting with Jawaharlal Nehru have somewhat openly accepted

02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:34.260
[Guest]: that they were doing it.

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:35.260
[Guest]: Right?

02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:37.220
[Guest]: When Gulzarilal Nanda says you've driven a tunnel through this stuff.

02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:38.220
[Guest]: Very good.

02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:39.220
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:40.740
[Guest]: And we are proudly announcing that we are doing it.

02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:43.580
[Guest]: It's not something that we are trying to hide as a fact.

02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:48.260
[Guest]: Subsequently, in 1965, when Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri was the thing, something

02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:49.740
[Guest]: even worse was done.

02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:54.860
[Guest]: The state JNK state government effectively was converted from a national conference government

02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:57.260
[Guest]: to a Congress Party government.

02:00:57.260 --> 02:01:01.740
[Guest]: And they amended the Kashmir constitution using their provisions of constitution amendment

02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:07.540
[Guest]: to make the elected Sadre Riyasat into a governor appointed by the center and also imported

02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:10.820
[Guest]: provisions under article 370 for imposition of president's rule.

02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:15.340
[Guest]: Just imagine a total fundamental change in the way that that thing happened.

02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:19.620
[Guest]: The agreement between Indira Gandhi and Sheikh Abdullah, which led to Sheikh Abdullah's return

02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:26.220
[Guest]: to power in 1975, again was on the premise that a number of powers which were vested

02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:27.900
[Guest]: in the JNK constitution would be the same.

02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:32.820
[Guest]: For instance, one of the key clauses of that Sheikh Abdullah-Indira Gandhi agreement was

02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:37.940
[Guest]: that the JNK constitution could not in any way legislate on the powers of the governor

02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:38.940
[Guest]: of the state.

02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:43.140
[Guest]: So effectively, you first made the governor an instrument of the center.

02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:46.060
[Guest]: You said through the instrument of the center, president's rule can be imposed.

02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:48.700
[Guest]: Then you say that the state's constitution cannot touch the governor at all.

02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:53.300
[Guest]: So effectively, you have sort of eroded the autonomy of the state in every conceivable

02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:54.300
[Guest]: way.

02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:59.420
[Guest]: In 1986, when the state was under governor's rule, Mr. Jagmohan was the governor at that

02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:03.420
[Guest]: point of time and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was there, they extended further provisions

02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:07.020
[Guest]: of the Indian constitution without any reference to anyone saying the governor is there to

02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:08.020
[Guest]: give concurrence.

02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:13.380
[Guest]: We know from historical records that even the law secretary of India had raised a sort

02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:17.740
[Guest]: of red flag saying that this is a dubious sort of move because the governor cannot stand

02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:18.740
[Guest]: it.

02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:19.740
[Guest]: But we said we will do it.

02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:25.100
[Guest]: So at every point of time, therefore, as you are saying, we have promised different kinds

02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:28.580
[Guest]: of self-determination or given them a different opportunity to say that, listen, we will allow

02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:29.580
[Guest]: you to have elections.

02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:32.300
[Guest]: Then in 1987, elections are rigged, right?

02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:37.420
[Guest]: So it is in that context that I think we have to understand the despair of the Kashmiris,

02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:43.140
[Guest]: which is to say that, you know, what is it that India says that we can take at face value

02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:46.580
[Guest]: or we can believe that India will stand by it because they are the stronger power.

02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:50.220
[Guest]: You know, there was a very nice article in the Hindu by Suhasini Haider, you know, she

02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:55.020
[Guest]: quoted to Thukdi D's as saying that the strong can do what they can and the weak must endure

02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:56.940
[Guest]: what they must, right?

02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:58.660
[Guest]: From the Malian dialogue.

02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:03.460
[Guest]: Now, if that is the position of the Kashmiris, then their despair is understandable because

02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:06.420
[Guest]: we have promised them many, many things in different ways.

02:03:06.420 --> 02:03:11.880
[Guest]: And what has now been done in a sense, not just is injurious to their thing, it adds

02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:17.660
[Guest]: insult to injury because now you're told that you don't even have the status of a state.

02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:24.220
[Guest]: One of the largest princely states of India has not only been absorbed into the Indian

02:03:24.220 --> 02:03:28.660
[Guest]: Union, you know, whatever, even if you think abolishing Article 370 means any greater integration,

02:03:28.660 --> 02:03:31.460
[Guest]: I don't believe there was any such further thing happening.

02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:35.780
[Guest]: But you reduced it to the state of Union Territory, and you held out a hope to them that they

02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:41.380
[Guest]: can rise up to the state level, if in the future, they sort of behave appropriately.

02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:47.700
[Guest]: Now, I think, you know, that is going to be a matter of deep resentment in Kashmir.

02:03:47.700 --> 02:03:51.020
[Guest]: We will have to see how future politics plays out.

02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:52.020
[Guest]: Nobody knows.

02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:58.180
[Amit Varma]: So I'll come to my second of three questions, sort of by also addressing what people might

02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:02.460
[Amit Varma]: say about self-determination being a slippery slope, for example, somebody might ask, what

02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:06.260
[Amit Varma]: if the people of Andheri want to be independent, where do you stop?

02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:10.860
[Amit Varma]: And what if the people of Warsaw then want to be independent from Andheri, which they

02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:11.860
[Amit Varma]: should?

02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:19.580
[Amit Varma]: And my response to that would by and large be that, I think, even as far as disaffection

02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:24.700
[Amit Varma]: of the Kashmiri people is concerned, they've been based on shifting sands, they have not

02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:27.060
[Amit Varma]: always been pissed off at the Union.

02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:31.740
[Amit Varma]: And in the rest of the country, what we have done is there is some semblance of good governance

02:04:31.740 --> 02:04:35.180
[Amit Varma]: and the rule of law and so on and so forth.

02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:39.060
[Amit Varma]: And the people can actually feel that okay, we are in a democracy, we have some chance,

02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:44.420
[Amit Varma]: we are not unequal compared to the other citizens of this great democracy.

02:04:44.420 --> 02:04:50.340
[Amit Varma]: But what has happened in Kashmir is that the way the state has behaved is with the people

02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:53.740
[Amit Varma]: is very different from say, Warsaw or Andheri.

02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:58.340
[Amit Varma]: I wrote an essay a while back, which I'll also link from the show notes, which sort

02:04:58.340 --> 02:05:03.140
[Amit Varma]: of took off on a lot of counterinsurgency literature I was reading and also David Devadas's

02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:06.900
[Amit Varma]: book, The Generation of Rage in Kashmir, which I'll also link from the show notes where

02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:11.820
[Amit Varma]: Devadas's point was that by 2007, basically a new generation had come up in Kashmir and

02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:17.340
[Amit Varma]: it was much more hopeful and aspirational, and so on and wanting to integrate with India.

02:05:17.340 --> 02:05:22.300
[Amit Varma]: But then the continued brutality by the state sort of, you know, caused them to rise up

02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:24.960
[Amit Varma]: against the state and just made things much worse.

02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:30.960
[Amit Varma]: Not the fault of this government alone, starting from the UPA government 2007-2008 onwards,

02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:31.960
[Amit Varma]: it got much worse.

02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:36.420
[Amit Varma]: And that brings me to a question of strategy on which again, you are an expert is that

02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:42.820
[Amit Varma]: what we have sort of learned from counterinsurgency literature, you know, right from Mao and T.E.

02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:47.020
[Amit Varma]: Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom and David Galula's books, is that if you are going to

02:05:47.020 --> 02:05:53.100
[Amit Varma]: tackle an insurgency, you don't do it with brute force, you do it with, you know, an

02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:57.980
[Amit Varma]: equation someone once came up with, which is 20% military, 80% political.

02:05:57.980 --> 02:06:02.100
[Amit Varma]: And the key there is that you have to have the local people on your side, so that the

02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:04.980
[Amit Varma]: insurgency doesn't have a place to hide.

02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:09.500
[Amit Varma]: And what instead we have done in Kashmir is instead of providing good governance and getting

02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:15.100
[Amit Varma]: the local people on your side, we have instead alienated the common man far more, made the

02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:20.380
[Amit Varma]: common person sympathetic to freedom fighters and terrorists, whatever one chooses to call

02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:21.380
[Amit Varma]: them.

02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:25.100
[Amit Varma]: And therefore made sure that even if we have Kashmir with us, we don't have the Kashmiri

02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:26.340
[Amit Varma]: with us.

02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:27.340
[Guest]: What are your thoughts on this?

02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:30.700
[Guest]: Well, I think that has been a challenge even before the insurgency began.

02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:36.060
[Guest]: And I think in some ways, the insurgency began as a response to this feeling that normal

02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:40.980
[Guest]: ways of, you know, dealing with India in normal politics, elections, negotiations are not

02:06:40.980 --> 02:06:41.980
[Guest]: going to do.

02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:45.100
[Guest]: So that's how an insurgent sort of group began.

02:06:45.100 --> 02:06:49.520
[Guest]: And as you're saying, you know, the fact that the Indian government also sort of responded

02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:54.020
[Guest]: with an iron fist meant that, you know, the local population then continued to support

02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:57.020
[Guest]: the insurgency to varying degrees over periods of time.

02:06:57.020 --> 02:06:59.980
[Guest]: As you're rightly saying, there have been periods when Kashmiris have been more or less

02:06:59.980 --> 02:07:00.980
[Guest]: hopeful.

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:04.660
[Guest]: You know, I'm not in a position to say whether in 2007, there was a new generation of Kashmiris

02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:06.940
[Amit Varma]: who are more hopeful or not.

02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:07.940
[Amit Varma]: That is Devadas's claim.

02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:08.940
[Guest]: And it's very interesting.

02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:10.100
[Guest]: Yeah, it's an interesting claim.

02:07:10.100 --> 02:07:14.220
[Guest]: But I think what is empirically true on in a sense, superficially, you know, you can

02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:19.220
[Guest]: sort of immediately sort of take it as granted that there is a generation of Kashmiris, which

02:07:19.220 --> 02:07:24.660
[Guest]: came of age by the late 2000s, who had practically grown up in the shadow of the insurgency.

02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:28.660
[Guest]: At least, you know, the generations which preceded them knew something of what life

02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:30.820
[Guest]: was before the insurgency began.

02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:35.100
[Guest]: And this, you know, very strong degree of sort of security response, which, you know,

02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:36.460
[Guest]: is a consequence of the insurgency.

02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:40.780
[Guest]: And again, I wouldn't want to sort of carry a brief for the insurgency in Kashmir, because,

02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:44.860
[Guest]: you know, the fact is that the Indian Army's presence was not as overweening in Kashmir

02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:46.220
[Guest]: before the insurgency began.

02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:48.460
[Guest]: It is a response to what the insurgency is.

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:51.240
[Guest]: And the insurgency has also brutalized the people of Kashmir.

02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:54.560
[Guest]: It is not a unilateral sort of brutalization, which has been done by the Indian Army.

02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:59.500
[Amit Varma]: There are many unpalatable elements of the insurgency, such as recent Islamism, the jihadism

02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:00.500
[Amit Varma]: that has come in.

02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:05.380
[Amit Varma]: So I'm not trying to pass a judgment in as an army good insurgency bad, or the other

02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:06.380
[Guest]: way around.

02:08:06.380 --> 02:08:07.380
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:08:07.380 --> 02:08:08.380
[Guest]: No, I fully agree.

02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:11.860
[Guest]: But all I'm trying to say is that for the ordinary Kashmiri, they have had to deal with

02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:16.100
[Guest]: the consequences of living in an environment which was dominated by an insurgency counter

02:08:16.100 --> 02:08:17.100
[Guest]: insurgency dynamic.

02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:18.100
[Guest]: Right?

02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:23.900
[Guest]: It is not a straightforward question of saying that this is just a pure sort of Israeli occupation

02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:24.900
[Guest]: of the West Bank.

02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:26.380
[Guest]: There is no insurgency happening in the West Bank.

02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:27.380
[Guest]: Right?

02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:30.020
[Guest]: I mean, there is a very different situation out here, which in some ways much worse possibly.

02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:34.700
[Guest]: Which is why I'm saying that for a generation of Kashmiris, what they have grown up is under

02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:40.140
[Guest]: the shadow of the gun, whether it is wielded by the insurgents or by the security forces.

02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:44.080
[Guest]: And that obviously has huge psychological implications for the way that they think about

02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:47.660
[Guest]: their future, about what they want, what they are willing to risk.

02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:50.940
[Guest]: You know, in the last couple of years, we have seen newspaper reporting.

02:08:50.940 --> 02:08:55.860
[Guest]: I have not been to Kashmir, but I've been reading newspaper reports, suggesting that

02:08:55.860 --> 02:09:00.540
[Guest]: people are actually preventing the security forces from carrying out operations by forming

02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:01.540
[Guest]: human shields.

02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:05.380
[Guest]: And, you know, actually sort of risking death effectively, because they can get, you know,

02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:08.460
[Guest]: they may be collateral damage in an operation, ongoing operation, if you come in between

02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:09.460
[Guest]: and so on.

02:09:09.460 --> 02:09:13.100
[Guest]: Now, all of that suggests a degree of despair, which is very high.

02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:17.620
[Guest]: And I think the challenge for us is now to say that, listen, how are we going to deal

02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:18.620
[Guest]: with that?

02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:20.940
[Guest]: That is the human element, and that is also the moral element.

02:09:20.940 --> 02:09:25.020
[Guest]: Because at the end of the day, you know, there is this famous line from the Vietnam War,

02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:26.020
[Guest]: right?

02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:31.300
[Guest]: I mean, it may be an apocryphal story where an American sort of Marines captain, you know,

02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:35.540
[Guest]: is interviewed by some news agencies immediately after the taking over of some village which

02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:40.580
[Guest]: has been strafed and bombed and they've captured it and says, you know, what, why did you have

02:09:40.580 --> 02:09:42.620
[Guest]: to do sort of, you know, use so much force?

02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:45.860
[Guest]: He says, we had to destroy the village in order to save it.

02:09:45.860 --> 02:09:47.220
[Guest]: That is a question we have to ask ourselves.

02:09:47.220 --> 02:09:51.020
[Guest]: Are we going to destroy people in order to save them?

02:09:51.020 --> 02:09:53.660
[Guest]: It's a mistake that we made in so many other guises in the past, right?

02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:59.500
[Guest]: We believe that in order to affirm our secular value, we have to keep somebody else in subjection.

02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:02.520
[Guest]: Then how does it mean an affirmation of any democratic values?

02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:06.220
[Guest]: So I think the question of means and ends, which is rightly posed, is today, I think,

02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:11.580
[Guest]: an even more urgent one, because the insurgency, at least in the short term, is likely to get

02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:17.620
[Guest]: some kind of a flip, because, you know, Pakistan will feel emboldened to sort of fish in troubled

02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:21.420
[Guest]: waters, you know, there may be more disaffected youth within Kashmir who may be willing to

02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:26.460
[Guest]: take up the gun, or they may not be, but let's assume that the insurgency and counter insurgency

02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:29.820
[Guest]: dynamic is not going away anytime soon, just because you abolished Article 370, that's

02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:30.820
[Amit Varma]: not going away.

02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:33.620
[Amit Varma]: No, and the point of my question was also to say, like you used to phrase the shadow

02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:34.620
[Amit Varma]: of the gun.

02:10:34.620 --> 02:10:38.380
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, the fact that there are so many young people living under the shadow

02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:43.900
[Amit Varma]: of the gun, who have seen their 12 year old brothers taken from home and shot in front

02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:47.620
[Amit Varma]: of a wall, and so on and so forth, that they've seen all this brutality unfold on their friends

02:10:47.620 --> 02:10:52.460
[Amit Varma]: and family, and others, and the point is, the shadow of the gun is actually the worst

02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:57.900
[Amit Varma]: way to fight the insurgency, you know, which is a lesson that we've learned over the decades.

02:10:57.900 --> 02:11:02.460
[Amit Varma]: And that if the Modi government wanted, it could just fight the insurgency in a very

02:11:02.460 --> 02:11:06.500
[Amit Varma]: different way by providing good governance, trying to win the people over.

02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:11.180
[Amit Varma]: And that would be far more successful in integrating Kashmir into India in the long run, if they

02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:12.180
[Amit Varma]: want to.

02:11:12.180 --> 02:11:15.380
[Amit Varma]: Is that kind of understanding not there within the…

02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:20.580
[Guest]: You know, Amit, let me try and explain what I think they are thinking, right, beyond this

02:11:20.580 --> 02:11:21.580
[Guest]: Article 370.

02:11:21.580 --> 02:11:25.500
[Guest]: Because there are important sort of glimpses we got of their reasoning behind this move

02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:28.500
[Guest]: from the Prime Minister's speeches, from the Home Minister's speeches, which I think,

02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:31.740
[Guest]: as analysts and observers, we should take seriously, right.

02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:35.840
[Guest]: In fact, I think in some ways, the Prime Minister concurs with what you said, which is that governance

02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:37.220
[Guest]: has not been good in Kashmir.

02:11:37.220 --> 02:11:41.100
[Guest]: In fact, he said in his speech, that ever since the imposition of governor's rule, we

02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:43.220
[Guest]: have managed to do many more schemes, etc, etc.

02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:46.860
[Guest]: Now, whether that's an empirically true fact or not, and to what extent all of that is

02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:48.300
[Guest]: done is a different question.

02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:54.300
[Guest]: But he shares this assumption that the existing status quo has not delivered any governance.

02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:56.500
[Amit Varma]: But things have actually become worse in the last five years.

02:11:56.500 --> 02:11:57.500
[Guest]: Maybe.

02:11:57.500 --> 02:12:00.060
[Guest]: As I said, I mean, you know, let's say, but all I'm trying to say is that they will share

02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:04.080
[Guest]: the diagnosis in some way, right, and they just have a different solution to the problem.

02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:08.660
[Guest]: And as I sort of read their sort of speeches and explanations, I think the way that they

02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:13.060
[Guest]: are thinking about it is to say that what Kashmir needs is actually a new kind of a

02:12:13.060 --> 02:12:16.700
[Guest]: political dispensation altogether, that, you know, and the Prime Minister has spoken many

02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:19.940
[Guest]: times about the three families which have looted Kashmir and so on, right, I mean, you

02:12:19.940 --> 02:12:21.340
[Guest]: would have recalled from his speech.

02:12:21.340 --> 02:12:25.700
[Guest]: So I think they now have come to a conclusion that we need a new generation of leaders in

02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:30.860
[Guest]: Kashmir, who will be willing to work with India, and can be sort of, you know, can sort

02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:34.700
[Guest]: of pursue an agenda in tandem with New Delhi, which would be very different from that in

02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:35.700
[Guest]: the past.

02:12:35.700 --> 02:12:36.700
[Guest]: Right.

02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:39.340
[Guest]: And in order to do that, we have to create a totally new political context.

02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:43.100
[Guest]: And which is why we started the level of panchayats, because we are hoping that a bottoms up sort

02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:47.720
[Guest]: of process of elections, etc, will force up new leaders to come.

02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:50.020
[Guest]: And those leaders will have to operate under a very different context.

02:12:50.020 --> 02:12:53.540
[Guest]: Because now, the main challenge for Kashmir is to get back statehood, which has been promised

02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:57.420
[Guest]: to them, at least implicitly, from Union Territory status.

02:12:57.420 --> 02:13:03.480
[Guest]: And now the political lines of Jammu Kashmir, the new Union Territory, are going to be drawn

02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:04.540
[Guest]: in different ways.

02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:08.820
[Guest]: And it's not very clear that the Kashmiris will have the kind of political dominance

02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:11.140
[Guest]: that they had in the previous dispensation, right.

02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:16.260
[Guest]: So a new politics is being created, which I think is one of their stated intentions.

02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:21.900
[Guest]: And the claim is that that politics will lead to newer forms of dealing with this problem,

02:13:21.900 --> 02:13:24.340
[Guest]: which will be much better than what we have tried in the past.

02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:27.940
[Guest]: Now I think to be fair, we should grant them that this is the reconstruction.

02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:32.260
[Guest]: Now whether this works or not, I myself feel a little skeptical, because, you know, as

02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:35.140
[Guest]: a historian, unfortunately, I am stuck in the past, right, people like me are told you're

02:13:35.140 --> 02:13:36.140
[Guest]: stuck in the past.

02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:37.140
[Guest]: Yes, I am stuck in the past.

02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:39.280
[Guest]: Because that's I studied the past for this thing.

02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:43.540
[Guest]: But when I look at leaders as stalwart as Sheikh Abdullah, you know, who, whether in

02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:49.020
[Guest]: 1952, after the Delhi Agreement, or in 1975, after his agreement with Indira Gandhi, felt

02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:53.780
[Guest]: that he could not really sort of sell the same agreement to his people.

02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:59.140
[Guest]: If stalwart leaders like that felt about agreements of autonomy, is it realistic to assume that

02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:03.100
[Guest]: there will be new leaders who will come out of the situation in Kashmir, who will say

02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:06.740
[Guest]: that no, actually, statehood, you know, is the main sort of objective for us, we should

02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:08.940
[Guest]: be happy with what is there.

02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:09.940
[Guest]: Maybe they will.

02:14:09.940 --> 02:14:11.640
[Guest]: I'm not saying that it is impossible.

02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:16.060
[Guest]: But as a student of history, it seems to me that there are limits to the plasticity of

02:14:16.060 --> 02:14:17.500
[Guest]: politics in Kashmir.

02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:19.380
[Guest]: It is not infinitely malleable.

02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:23.180
[Guest]: There are certain things and that is the nature of every democratic process.

02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:27.220
[Guest]: And it is not just India, but any country which has dealt, you know, you look at Americans,

02:14:27.220 --> 02:14:30.740
[Guest]: you know, they wanted someone like Hamid Karzai to be in Afghanistan.

02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:34.900
[Guest]: But Hamid Karzai then turns out to be a very difficult actor for you to deal with because

02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:38.740
[Guest]: his incentives are not to toe your line all the time, or to do exactly what you want.

02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:43.040
[Guest]: You may both want the same thing, which is overall development, etc.

02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:46.900
[Guest]: But his idea of how that has to be accomplished, cuts across with yours.

02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:50.380
[Guest]: Same thing happened with Ingo Dindium in South Vietnam back in the day, right?

02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:55.580
[Guest]: So I don't see, therefore, that democratic politics is as capable of being shaped by

02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:58.540
[Guest]: grand designs, as we seem to assume.

02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:03.700
[Guest]: But we have made a start, it's a, it's a start, which has torn up the past, broken away from

02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:05.620
[Guest]: it in a very dramatic way.

02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:08.820
[Guest]: Even if it has used the same means that were used in the past, but I think still this is

02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:12.700
[Guest]: a step, an order of magnitude, different kind of decision which has been taken, we'll have

02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:13.700
[Amit Varma]: to see how it plays out.

02:15:13.700 --> 02:15:16.380
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the future is all unknown unknowns.

02:15:16.380 --> 02:15:20.620
[Amit Varma]: And for my last question, I want to shift the context a little bit, where I am going

02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:26.420
[Amit Varma]: to say, let's not talk about how constitution or non constitutional 370 is.

02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:31.860
[Amit Varma]: Let's not even talk about the Kashmir itself, how that issue has evolved through the years

02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:34.860
[Amit Varma]: and all the politics and geopolitics about that.

02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:40.240
[Amit Varma]: Let's look at the 370 within the context of the fact that this was one of the key demands

02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:44.020
[Amit Varma]: of a resurgent Hindu right, which is now on the political ascendant.

02:15:44.020 --> 02:15:49.260
[Amit Varma]: Some would say it's a coming together of culture and politics in a sense.

02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:53.980
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, their key demands were things like cow slaughter, 370, these have been the

02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:56.700
[Amit Varma]: signature issues which they've used through the years.

02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:01.100
[Amit Varma]: And you now see all of these playing out in a in on a bigger scale where cow slaughter

02:16:01.100 --> 02:16:04.140
[Amit Varma]: is again an issue, you have lynchings going up in the country.

02:16:04.140 --> 02:16:08.500
[Amit Varma]: Now they've done 370, maybe they'll build the temple next, who knows?

02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:12.340
[Amit Varma]: What direction do you see this country broadly going in?

02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:17.780
[Amit Varma]: And this is again, you know, outside the issue of Kashmir, because like I said, I think what

02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:21.660
[Amit Varma]: happened on August 5th is more than just about Kashmir is also about India.

02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:24.620
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, historians make a very bad astrologers.

02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:28.340
[Amit Varma]: So you know, I have no means of dividing where we are going down.

02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:31.620
[Amit Varma]: What's the best case scenario and worst case scenario for the next 10 years?

02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:35.100
[Guest]: You know, honestly, I, I don't think I'm very well placed to answer that question.

02:16:35.100 --> 02:16:38.740
[Guest]: But let me take a stab at giving a serious answer to your first question.

02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:43.820
[Guest]: Now, you're right that, you know, we are at a in a different kind of a political situation

02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:48.740
[Guest]: where there is a new political party, which has emerged as the hegemonic force by hegemonic

02:16:48.740 --> 02:16:53.740
[Guest]: as a force, which has the consent of a large number of electorate.

02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:57.700
[Guest]: And especially if you look at the last election in the Hindi speaking states, the BJP has

02:16:57.700 --> 02:17:00.100
[Guest]: clearly emerged as a hegemonic power.

02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:03.460
[Guest]: And they believe that these are issues on which they have campaigned.

02:17:03.460 --> 02:17:07.020
[Guest]: And again, they're right in saying so, and that they have a mandate, therefore, to do

02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:08.020
[Guest]: it.

02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:10.580
[Guest]: And that is clearly sort of understandable, it is legitimate.

02:17:10.580 --> 02:17:16.100
[Guest]: But as we know, with any liberal democracy of the kind that we are, the things like the

02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:21.140
[Guest]: Constitution exists for a certain reason, which is basically to sort of ensure that

02:17:21.140 --> 02:17:24.820
[Guest]: democratic majoritarianism cannot upturn the fundamentals of the state.

02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:29.340
[Guest]: That is what the Constitution's, you know, so called, you know, function is.

02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:35.860
[Guest]: Now, if, if we are going to overturn the procedural norms of using the Constitution for various

02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:41.580
[Guest]: ends, simply because of claiming majoritarian legitimation, then I think we are at an inflection

02:17:41.580 --> 02:17:42.580
[Guest]: point.

02:17:42.580 --> 02:17:45.580
[Guest]: We have been in a similar inflection point in the past, there used to be huge tussles

02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:50.300
[Guest]: between what the state could do, the government could do vis-a-vis the Constitution back in

02:17:50.300 --> 02:17:53.820
[Guest]: the Indira Gandhi period, which has then led to this doctrine of the basic structure, which

02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:57.100
[Guest]: came out of the Keshavand Bharti sort of, you know, case.

02:17:57.100 --> 02:18:03.020
[Guest]: Now, the question for us is whether now we are doing things where another more clever

02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:08.020
[Guest]: way of using the provisions of the Constitution to do these kinds of things is possible, and

02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:11.260
[Guest]: whether the courts are actually going to uphold, which is why I think it is going to be interesting

02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:15.160
[Guest]: to see how the courts deal with these legal challenges.

02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:18.640
[Guest]: Because the courts do not sit in the heaven, they sit in this country.

02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:22.380
[Guest]: And they have to also take into account various other kinds of factors as they do it.

02:18:22.380 --> 02:18:23.380
[Guest]: Like public opinion?

02:18:23.380 --> 02:18:24.380
[Guest]: I don't know whether they do.

02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:25.720
[Guest]: I'm not a constitutional scholar.

02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:29.700
[Guest]: But I would imagine that in the past, if you look at it, I mean, courts have always not

02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:33.940
[Guest]: necessarily taken on the executive in a very direct way when it comes to this thing.

02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:39.300
[Guest]: But I think what has happened in this month will raise a series of legal questions, which

02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:44.180
[Guest]: are at least of as much importance as the sort of landmark cases in the Supreme Court

02:18:44.180 --> 02:18:47.780
[Guest]: starting in the late 60s running through to the mid 70s happened.

02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:52.540
[Guest]: And as I see it, you know, there is a tussle always in any country between democracy and

02:18:52.540 --> 02:18:53.540
[Guest]: constitutionalism, right?

02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:57.020
[Guest]: I mean, these are not necessarily compatible values, right?

02:18:57.020 --> 02:19:02.140
[Guest]: And we have to see how this judgment plays out, in a sense, how this balance, what kind

02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:03.460
[Guest]: of new equilibrium do we arrive at?

02:19:03.460 --> 02:19:07.300
[Guest]: If we are going to arrive at an equilibrium that listen, majoritarian legitimization is

02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:11.780
[Guest]: sufficient to override all other kinds of things, and everything is up for grabs, then

02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:15.140
[Guest]: possibly we are looking at a very, very different way of doing things.

02:19:15.140 --> 02:19:18.580
[Guest]: In the past, again, this is not the first time that we are in a situation like this.

02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:21.660
[Guest]: Mrs. Gandhi attempted many such things during the emergency.

02:19:21.660 --> 02:19:26.100
[Guest]: But post the emergency, many of those things were also repealed, right?

02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:28.820
[Guest]: We saw many of those constitutional amendments sort of being repealed, and so on.

02:19:28.820 --> 02:19:31.500
[Guest]: Now, I'm not trying to suggest that we are in any comparable situation.

02:19:31.500 --> 02:19:36.580
[Guest]: But all I'm trying to say is that the questions are similar, which is about how do we go about

02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:38.380
[Guest]: using the provisions of the Constitution?

02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:43.500
[Guest]: What is the relationship between a majoritarian affirmation in elections, and the kinds of

02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:45.500
[Guest]: constitutional changes that we can bring about?

02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:47.660
[Guest]: And what does this mean for the country as a whole?

02:19:47.660 --> 02:19:51.660
[Amit Varma]: And also just to sort of take that thought forward and throw this at you at the same

02:19:51.660 --> 02:19:57.660
[Amit Varma]: time is that one fundamental way in which this tussle, as you use the term currently,

02:19:57.660 --> 02:20:02.900
[Amit Varma]: is different from what Indira Gandhi did was Indira Gandhi was, as far as I can see, driven

02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:05.380
[Amit Varma]: essentially by the will to power.

02:20:05.380 --> 02:20:09.700
[Amit Varma]: And whatever changes in the Constitution she made was driven by that.

02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:14.980
[Amit Varma]: But there is a deeper philosophical dispute here in the legitimacy of this Constitution

02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:21.300
[Amit Varma]: and the kind of constitutionalism that we have, where a lot of Hindutva right wing thinkers

02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:26.460
[Amit Varma]: have, for example, argued in the past that this is a constitution made by liberal elites

02:20:26.460 --> 02:20:31.580
[Amit Varma]: and doesn't represent what the people actually believe in or stand for.

02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:36.180
[Amit Varma]: So when you talk about, for example, you use the phrases democratic majoritarianism shaking

02:20:36.180 --> 02:20:40.580
[Amit Varma]: the foundations of the state, I think what the argument from the Hindu right would be

02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:45.940
[Amit Varma]: that the foundations of the state are the wrong foundations, that they don't agree with

02:20:45.940 --> 02:20:49.660
[Amit Varma]: the definition of constitutionalism that you and I would agree with that it's essentially

02:20:49.660 --> 02:20:52.980
[Amit Varma]: the Constitution has to be a check on the power of the state and has to protect the

02:20:52.980 --> 02:20:56.860
[Amit Varma]: people against the state, but they would not necessarily agree with that.

02:20:56.860 --> 02:21:02.220
[Amit Varma]: And in that tussle, who is to say that whether their vision of what the Constitution should

02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:07.860
[Amit Varma]: be is more legitimate, or our vision, which is still the vision of liberal elites?

02:21:07.860 --> 02:21:14.460
[Guest]: No, I agree with you that there is no reason to assume that, you know, a group of people,

02:21:14.460 --> 02:21:17.260
[Guest]: maybe a majority of people in this country may have a very different vision of what the

02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:18.260
[Guest]: Constitution should be.

02:21:18.260 --> 02:21:23.380
[Guest]: But all I'm trying to say is that, if you want to reach that vision, you cannot do it

02:21:23.380 --> 02:21:26.900
[Guest]: through the existing constitutional means, you need to convene another Constituent Assembly

02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:28.100
[Guest]: and do it.

02:21:28.100 --> 02:21:30.820
[Guest]: That is how you can supersede the existing Constitution, because the existing Constitution

02:21:30.820 --> 02:21:36.220
[Guest]: lays certain kinds of provisions in here, including the doctrine of basic structure,

02:21:36.220 --> 02:21:40.180
[Guest]: which has now become I think, again, I'm not a constitutional scholar, but as a historian,

02:21:40.180 --> 02:21:44.540
[Guest]: to the extent that I've read and understood these things, it has become a fairly well

02:21:44.540 --> 02:21:48.300
[Guest]: defined doctrine, which is actually applicable in many, used in many other countries as well,

02:21:48.300 --> 02:21:50.260
[Guest]: in dealing with these situations, right.

02:21:50.260 --> 02:21:54.420
[Guest]: And in a sense, should also incidentally be applicable to the Constitution of the JNK

02:21:54.420 --> 02:21:58.300
[Guest]: state itself, who's not only basic structure, but entire structure has been evacuated.

02:21:58.300 --> 02:21:59.300
[Guest]: Exactly.

02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:03.180
[Guest]: So, that's why I'm saying that there are many interesting and important constitutional questions

02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:07.020
[Guest]: at stake here, which will be discussed and the courts will come to some kind of a judgment

02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:08.580
[Guest]: on these questions.

02:22:08.580 --> 02:22:13.260
[Guest]: So, I do not for once deny that people may want to have a different Constitution.

02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:18.180
[Guest]: All I'm trying to say is that we are in a currently in one constitutional regime.

02:22:18.180 --> 02:22:21.020
[Guest]: You may feel that, listen, this constitutional regime is the wrong one for this country to

02:22:21.020 --> 02:22:22.020
[Guest]: have.

02:22:22.020 --> 02:22:27.540
[Guest]: Though I, I'm hard pressed to say that it is done by some bunch of liberal elites alone,

02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:28.540
[Guest]: right?

02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:33.940
[Guest]: I think that is not the case to all of us, especially our readers, you know, our listeners,

02:22:33.940 --> 02:22:39.180
[Guest]: I would recommend a book by Rohit Dey, which is about the people's constitution, about

02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:43.860
[Guest]: how very ordinary people in India, as soon as the Constitution came into effect, use

02:22:43.860 --> 02:22:47.180
[Guest]: the provisions of the Constitution to secure their own rights, to suggest that this is

02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:51.700
[Guest]: a document of by and for liberal elites is I think, a travesty of history.

02:22:51.700 --> 02:22:53.460
[Amit Varma]: I'll get that book from the show notes.

02:22:53.460 --> 02:22:54.460
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:22:54.460 --> 02:22:56.060
[Guest]: So, I may have got the title of the book.

02:22:56.060 --> 02:22:58.180
[Guest]: I think that's what it's called the people's constitution.

02:22:58.180 --> 02:22:59.260
[Guest]: I think it's a very important book.

02:22:59.260 --> 02:23:03.980
[Guest]: I think it's one of the most important books written about the history of the Indian constitution

02:23:03.980 --> 02:23:05.860
[Guest]: making process and what it meant.

02:23:05.860 --> 02:23:11.380
[Guest]: And I think it fundamentally belies this proposition that it was a document for liberal elites

02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:12.860
[Guest]: and made by liberal elites.

02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:19.140
[Guest]: I freely concede that it was a, you know, a constitution, which kind of was made on

02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:20.740
[Guest]: limited franchise and so on.

02:23:20.740 --> 02:23:24.260
[Guest]: But to suggest therefore that it is ipso facto illegitimate or that it is under representative

02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:26.820
[Guest]: of this country, I think is a travesty.

02:23:26.820 --> 02:23:28.500
[Guest]: I don't think that is true.

02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:32.780
[Guest]: Of course, the, you know, any group of people who believe that they have the numbers and

02:23:32.780 --> 02:23:37.020
[Guest]: the political power to want to bring about a new constitutional regime are entirely at

02:23:37.020 --> 02:23:38.460
[Guest]: liberty to do so.

02:23:38.460 --> 02:23:42.700
[Guest]: But it cannot be done within the frameworks and contours of the existing system.

02:23:42.700 --> 02:23:47.540
[Guest]: You need to have a total revolution, approve all of this stuff and take us to a totally

02:23:47.540 --> 02:23:48.540
[Guest]: different one.

02:23:48.540 --> 02:23:52.600
[Guest]: I'd imagine, you know, that is an enterprise about which a lot of people will have some

02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:53.600
[Guest]: questions to ask.

02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:57.300
[Amit Varma]: I can't make out if that's a hopeful note to end on or not.

02:23:57.300 --> 02:24:01.700
[Amit Varma]: But at least you and I are on the same page as regards to the desirability of this constitution,

02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:04.900
[Amit Varma]: whether we are liberal elites or not is another question entirely.

02:24:04.900 --> 02:24:05.900
[Amit Varma]: Thanks so much for coming on the show.

02:24:05.900 --> 02:24:06.900
