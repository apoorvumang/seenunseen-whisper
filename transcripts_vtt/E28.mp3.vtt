00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.920
[Amit Varma]: I had a strange dream the other day. I dreamed that I was in heaven. In fact, I'd been in

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.440
[Amit Varma]: heaven for a week by then. Every day, I would get up in the morning, eat lots of bacon and

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.480
[Amit Varma]: be bathed by voluptuous woman wearing aromatic perfumes and little else. Whatever music I

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.280
[Amit Varma]: felt like listening to would be playing in the background. Even before I knew that I

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.120
[Amit Varma]: felt like listening to it. And now, random autograph hunters would keep accosting me,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.320
[Amit Varma]: touching my feet, taking my autograph and telling me what a great podcast the seen and

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.640
[Amit Varma]: the unseen was. But on this particular day, something bad happened. I asked this attendant

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.760
[Amit Varma]: of mine in silk harem pants for my usual mid-morning snack of a seafood platter. And he said that

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.040
[Amit Varma]: there would be no more seafood platters in heaven. I was shocked by this. He said it

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.600
[Amit Varma]: was the order of the canteen manager, St. Peter. So I headed over to the canteen and

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.040
[Amit Varma]: I met St. Peter. And I demanded to know why there were to be no more seafood platters.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:16.960
[Amit Varma]: St. Peter replied, Amit, Sai, what can I tell you? Life is hard. We have been hit with GST.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.520
[Amit Varma]: I've been told there's a 5% GST on prawns, 2.3% on fish, unless it is fish with skin

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.240
[Amit Varma]: on it, which is 3.9%, unless it is batter fried, in which case it is 19.2%. And there's

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.520
[Amit Varma]: a 14% GST on squid and a 44% tax on octopus because of all the hands. It's driving me

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.680
[Amit Varma]: nuts. There is no way I can comply. So no more seafood platters from today. But this

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.040
[Amit Varma]: is crazy, I said. Why are you even charging GST? This is heaven. Who takes GST from you?

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.200
[Amit Varma]: He looked at me sadly. The devil does, he said. The devil runs everything, bro. And

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.800
[Amit Varma]: soon he will turn heaven into hell.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:08.640
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.320
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.840
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen. Our topic for today is GST, the goods and services tax.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, there was an episode of The Scene and The Unseen on this a few months ago with Devangshu

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.200
[Amit Varma]: Dutta before the GST had come into being. While the GST has an awesome intention and

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.160
[Amit Varma]: I support it in theory, there were a lot of practical issues with how it was being implemented.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.080
[Amit Varma]: Devangshu feared at the time that there were going to be too many slabs and exemptions,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.440
[Amit Varma]: which would make compliance impossible and unleash an Inspector Raj on businesses. Anyway,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.080
[Amit Varma]: I have with me in the studio today, a good friend of mine, the journalist Vivek Kaul,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.040
[Amit Varma]: who has been writing about GST a lot since it's been implemented. Vivek, welcome to the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.040
[Amit Varma]: show.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040
[Amit Varma]: Thanks for having me, Amit.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.480
[Amit Varma]: Vivek, a few months back in January, I had done an episode of The Scene and The Unseen

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.960
[Amit Varma]: with Devangshu Dutta on GST. And GST hadn't come into force then nevertheless, but we

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.040
[Amit Varma]: discussed among other things, the intention of GST, which we expected to be the scene

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.320
[Amit Varma]: effect, which is of course, that it rationalizes all the various different taxes and it vastly

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.920
[Amit Varma]: simplifies taxation and in that sense is...

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.920
[Amit Varma]: On a theoretical level.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.080
[Amit Varma]: On a theoretical level. And on a practical level, we discussed the possible unintended

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.360
[Amit Varma]: consequences and Devangshu warned that if there were too many slabs and exemptions,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.840
[Amit Varma]: it would in fact defeat the purpose, make compliance difficult, if not impossible, and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.360
[Amit Varma]: perhaps even increase the amount of red tape instead of decreasing it. Now, all these months

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.240
[Amit Varma]: later, GST is finally in action. You and I both have our GST numbers, we file taxes,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.280
[Amit Varma]: we're looking at what's happening around us, and you've been writing a bit about it. So,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.120
[Amit Varma]: can you tell me what your thoughts are about GST now, given, you know, the positive intent,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.680
[Amit Varma]: some of which is no doubt manifesting, and also the unseen effects?

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.680
[Guest]: Right. So that's like, you know, one question which takes care of the entire show.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'll just shut up now.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.360
[Guest]: So I mean, as I mean, as you rightly said, and as Devangshu would have also said on the

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.960
[Guest]: show, is that GST subsumes a lot of indirect taxes. So I mean, if I think Prime Minister

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.440
[Guest]: Narendra Modi made a reference to this as well, wherein he said around 17 indirect taxes

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.320
[Guest]: and 23 different cesses are subsumed under it. So prima facie, you know, if you look

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:37.280
[Guest]: at just this fact, you cannot be against the idea of a goods and services tax. Having said

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.160
[Guest]: that, I mean, there are many other points which need to be discussed. The first point

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.400
[Guest]: as I mean, again, you rightly said is the number of different rates under GST. So we

00:04:49.400 --> 00:05:03.320
[Guest]: have 0%, 0.25%, 3%, 5%, 12%, 18%, 29%, and 29% plus different cesses. So we have close

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.640
[Guest]: to, I mean, 8 rates. I mean, it's more than 8 if you look at the various combinations

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:16.760
[Guest]: of 28% plus cess, right. So this obviously leads to a situation where, you know, the

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:25.400
[Guest]: system that evolves tends to become extremely complicated and convoluted. So, you know,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.080
[Guest]: if you were to sort of look at it in a very simplistic way, there is something that Veerappa

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.800
[Guest]: Moily said in his speech in the parliament wherein he asked, is KitKat chocolate or is

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:44.720
[Guest]: it a biscuit? Or what we call in India, biscuit. So that's a very simple example. After the

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.120
[Guest]: implementation of GST, some of the examples that have come out are very, very interesting.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:56.720
[Guest]: So it seems some of the retailers are selling, you know, one shoe at a time because then

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:04.000
[Guest]: the rate of GST becomes lower. Like, I think the rate of GST goes up at 800 rupees. So

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.760
[Guest]: if it's a 1000 rupee shoe, it makes sense for them to sell each shoe for 500 each. Right.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.220
[Guest]: So this is, you know, the brilliant Indian jugaad at work. And then there have also been

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.840
[Guest]: stories about how, you know, if a woman goes and buys a salwa kameez, the dupatta is being

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:27.600
[Guest]: built separately and I mean, you know, stuff like that. So yes, so I mean, so there are

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:35.720
[Guest]: issues which multiple levels of tax create and these issues need to be, you know, handled.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.080
[Guest]: I mean, and the simplest way of handling them is to not have multiple issues, multiple levels

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.320
[Guest]: of tax. So that is the first and foremost thing, you know, that is happening on the

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.680
[Guest]: unseen side. Then, you know, the more important issue, which I think is not being discussed

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:03.720
[Guest]: at all is the impact on the informal economy. I mean, informal economy is basically, you

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.360
[Guest]: know, industry which essentially operates outside the rules and regulations of the government

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.400
[Guest]: and given that the government is not able to collect any tax from them. Now, so the

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:22.240
[Guest]: hope is that the GST will lead to a reduction of this informal economy and that will be

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.960
[Guest]: beneficial for the government. Again, you know, if you were to look at it in a very

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.800
[Guest]: straightforward, simplistic way, this makes immense sense. I mean, why should firms not

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.840
[Guest]: pay tax, right? Why should some firms not pay tax when others are? But that's a very

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:48.080
[Guest]: simplistic way of looking at it. Now, why do I say that is primarily because, you know,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:55.600
[Guest]: the kind of analysis that has been put forward in the media is that once GST comes into force,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.000
[Guest]: all these informal firms will be forced to become formal firms and that will be good

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.520
[Guest]: for the economy because, you know, the tax collected by the government will go up and

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:12.000
[Guest]: then the government can do other things which it doesn't have money for right now.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:22.240
[Guest]: The point is that, you know, such transitions never happen smoothly. Now, a good example

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:28.320
[Guest]: that I can think of right now is, you know, in the late 80s and the early 90s, the computerization

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.920
[Guest]: drive in the government and the public sector banks started and that did not happen overnight.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.280
[Guest]: I mean, there was a huge resistance to it. So, the point I'm trying to make is that,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.640
[Guest]: you know, such disruptions do not work very, very smoothly.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.920
[Amit Varma]: I'll just make a mild tangent here and I'm sure you'll agree with me on this, is that

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.880
[Amit Varma]: even during demonetization, they claim that, okay, you know, getting rid of the informal

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.120
[Amit Varma]: sector and making it formal is a big game and so on and so forth. And people often use

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.200
[Amit Varma]: the term informal sector as if it is prima facie something bad.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.800
[Guest]: I find it very surprising. I mean, it is not derogatory. You know, everybody has the right

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.160
[Guest]: to make a living. Exactly. I mean, if there are no jobs going around, I have the right

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:17.080
[Guest]: to make a living. And that means, you know, I start a tea stall on the road and, you know,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.080
[Amit Varma]: sell tea.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.680
[Amit Varma]: Exactly. And a lot of the informal sector actually exists, is forced to exist because

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.120
[Amit Varma]: of bad laws and regulations, like all the labor laws by the government itself. It's

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.840
[Amit Varma]: the government's fault, not the informal sector's fault necessarily. And you used to phrase

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.720
[Amit Varma]: a little while back, which again struck a chord, where you said that, you know, if the

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.720
[Amit Varma]: informal sector comes into the tax net, it's beneficial for the government, quote unquote.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.280
[Amit Varma]: But in my mind, what is beneficial for the government is not necessarily always beneficial

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.280
[Amit Varma]: for the country.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.800
[Guest]: No, which is fair. So, the point I was trying to make is that that is the logic being offered.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:10:01.880
[Guest]: So, to come back, you know, to try and answer this question in a little more detail. Now,

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:08.600
[Guest]: there are essentially two features at the heart of the GST. I mean, they're basically,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:14.080
[Guest]: you know, two ends of the same spectrum. But, you know, explaining the entire concept would

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.440
[Guest]: be a little easier if we considered them to be two separate features. One is the idea

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:24.120
[Guest]: of input tax credit, and the other is the self-policing feature that is built into the

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:31.120
[Guest]: GST. They're basically, you know, two sides of the same coin. So, what happens is, let's

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:38.200
[Guest]: say you are a manufacturer, you are a car manufacturer. Now, you need multiple inputs

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.560
[Guest]: in order to manufacture that car, you cannot manufacture everything yourself. So, let's

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.960
[Guest]: say you buy steering from someone, you buy seats from someone else, you buy tires from

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.960
[Guest]: a third guy, and so on and so forth. You may even buy engines from someone else, for that

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:59.320
[Guest]: matter. Now, what used to happen in the pre-GST era is that when you bought those inputs,

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:05.680
[Guest]: you were paying a price in which the tax already paid on those inputs was built into the price.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.240
[Guest]: So, it was like a double tax because then you...

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:14.000
[Guest]: So, now, when you paid tax, you were not allowed to take credit for the tax that had already

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.240
[Guest]: been paid on the inputs you were using to manufacture your product, in this case, which

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:25.200
[Guest]: happens to be a car. So, what that did was that ultimately when the consumer paid the

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:32.840
[Guest]: final price for a car, he was also paying tax on tax or what we call the cascading effect,

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:39.520
[Guest]: and he ended up paying a lot more than he should have. Now, in the post-GST era, what

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:46.040
[Guest]: will happen is that the car manufacturer can take an input tax credit for all the GST that

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.640
[Guest]: has been paid on the inputs that he has used in the manufacturing of the car. So, to that

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:58.480
[Guest]: extent, you know, prices will come down because there will no longer be any tax on tax. So,

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.960
[Guest]: the cascading effect, you know, goes out of the window.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.200
[Guest]: Now, this is, and this is if you, you know, if you follow the news, if you follow the

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:16.040
[Guest]: news lately, most of the car and bike manufacturers have cut prices. So, this is the ideal example

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:21.840
[Guest]: of how, you know, GST works well for the society as a whole, wherein the total amount, the

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.800
[Amit Varma]: price paid for a product actually came down.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.960
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely. It's a dream theoretical example.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.200
[Guest]: It's a very good example. And this is, in fact, if you look at, you know, everyone who's

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.720
[Guest]: been talking in support of GST, this is the example they end up offering. I mean, nobody

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.240
[Guest]: talks about the fact that, you know, if you go to a restaurant, what they've simply done

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.120
[Guest]: is that they have added GST on top of their prices. Now, what they should have ideally

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:50.560
[Guest]: done is they should have subtracted the taxes that they used to pay on those prices, and

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.760
[Guest]: then added GST onto it. Nobody's done that. I mean, they've just taken the latest prices

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.200
[Amit Varma]: and added GST onto it.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.520
[Guest]: Which in a sense is the simplest way out of the moment.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:05.280
[Guest]: You don't expect a normal small restaurant guy to sort of, you know, calculate.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.080
[Guest]: But then that is also, I mean, how many times do you buy a new car and how many times do

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.200
[Guest]: you go to a restaurant? So, that is something that one needs to...

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.880
[Amit Varma]: I buy three cars a day and I don't eat too much.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:25.120
[Guest]: I mean, that means you have a lot of money. Why are you doing this podcast?

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:32.080
[Guest]: So the guy taking the input tax credit has to essentially ensure that all, you know,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.120
[Guest]: his entire supply chain or value chain or whatever you might call it, is registered

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.600
[Guest]: under the goods and services tax, which means they have a goods and services tax identification

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.600
[Guest]: number, which is, you know, GSTIN.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.640
[Guest]: Which makes the whole process smooth.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:54.040
[Guest]: And they need to have invoices from all of them. Now, what that does is that everyone

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.040
[Guest]: is on the radar of the government.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:01.640
[Guest]: And the moment that chain breaks, you know that someone somewhere is not paying tax.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.800
[Guest]: So that is the self-policing feature which is built into the GST.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:11.480
[Guest]: So anyone who wants to take the input tax credit has to ensure that everyone down the

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.480
[Guest]: line is also on the GST.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:22.000
[Guest]: So the idea here is that the moment a firm operating in the informal economy comes into

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.760
[Guest]: such a supply chain or a value chain, they will have to go formal.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.520
[Guest]: Because otherwise, they will no longer get the business that they used to.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:38.560
[Guest]: Now, this is a very, it's an extremely simplistic way of looking at it because, you know, a

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.520
[Guest]: firm which is operating in the informal economy just doesn't do it because it doesn't want

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.520
[Amit Varma]: to pay tax.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.720
[Guest]: Is there for a reason beyond just wanting to pay tax?

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.960
[Guest]: Just not wanting to pay.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.320
[Guest]: It is also there because there are so many rules and regulations that need to be followed

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.600
[Guest]: that if they become a part of the formal economy, it would just not be viable for them to be

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600
[Amit Varma]: in that business.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.560
[Amit Varma]: On the margins, they might have to shut down and therefore the implications of going formal

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.560
[Guest]: are existential.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.560
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:09.520
[Guest]: So there was this, you know, very important piece of fact that was highlighted in the

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:16.920
[Guest]: National Manufacturing Policy of 2011, which is ultimately what became Make in India, that

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:22.000
[Guest]: an average manufacturing firm has to follow around 70 rules and regulations and needs

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.200
[Guest]: to file around 100 returns a year.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.640
[Guest]: So a firm which is not a part of the formal economy, it's not just about, you know, not

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.720
[Guest]: wanting to pay tax.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.380
[Guest]: So what happens now, you know, that GST is in place.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.720
[Guest]: So such a firm may or may not want to go formal.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:46.500
[Guest]: Let's say it decides, you know, it doesn't go formal and it decides to shut down.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:51.440
[Guest]: So the first thing that happens is there are job losses.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.520
[Guest]: So it needs to be highlighted here that, you know, we really don't know how big our informal

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.880
[Guest]: economy is.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:04.920
[Guest]: And I have seen, you know, essentially projections or rather figures from the informal economy

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:13.080
[Guest]: constitutes around 35 to 45 percent of the GDP and around 66 to 92 percent of the jobs

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.640
[Guest]: are in the informal economy.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.320
[Guest]: And these also includes informal jobs in the formal economy wherein, you know, there are

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.600
[Guest]: firms which report that they have an X number of jobs, but they actually have more jobs

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.600
[Amit Varma]: than that.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.400
[Guest]: Which they don't report because of labor laws and so on.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.240
[Guest]: Labor laws and so on and so forth.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:36.280
[Guest]: So you are essentially, you know, targeting a huge part of the labor force.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.760
[Guest]: Now let's say these firms shut down.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.760
[Guest]: Now what happens then?

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.120
[Guest]: Obviously, there are job losses and then, you know, there is impact on consumption and

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.120
[Guest]: so on and so forth.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.480
[Guest]: Now these are things which are not very easy to measure.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.680
[Guest]: The second thing that is a little more obvious is that when an informal firm shuts down,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:17:02.120
[Guest]: a smaller formal firm may decide to produce more in order to take over that business which

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.960
[Guest]: was available.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.440
[Guest]: But again that would depend on, you know, whether it is viable for them to do so or

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.440
[Guest]: not.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.440
[Guest]: Right.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.000
[Guest]: So, you know, many formal firms continue to want to stay small so that they don't come

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.280
[Guest]: under the ambit of labor laws.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.400
[Guest]: I mean, this is what we were talking.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.640
[Guest]: Now Jagdish Bhagwati and Arvind Panagaria write in India's Chess with Destiny, the

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:30.000
[Guest]: cost due to labor legislations rise progressively in discrete steps at 7, 10, 20, 50 and 100

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
[Guest]: workers.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.520
[Guest]: As the firm size rises from 6 regular workers towards 100, at no point between two thresholds

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:42.560
[Guest]: is the saving in manufacturing costs sufficiently large to pay for the extra cost of satisfying

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.560
[Guest]: these laws.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:50.160
[Guest]: So, which basically means that if firms operating in the informal economy shut down, the smaller

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.560
[Guest]: formal firms may not be in a position to take over that business.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.560
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.640
[Amit Varma]: It becomes a negative sum game.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.600
[Amit Varma]: It is not as if someone will take over that bit of the market.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.880
[Amit Varma]: It is that the firm in the informal sector was informal because it was impossible to

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.800
[Amit Varma]: service that demand and carry out that function in a formal way because of the laws and regulations.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.160
[Guest]: So what will happen is again, is that the formal, the bigger formal firms will now have

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:17.720
[Guest]: a larger chunk of the market and that will give them a better pricing power than they

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.720
[Guest]: have right now.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:25.240
[Guest]: You know, a lot of the informal firms essentially ensure that the larger formal firms do not,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:31.600
[Guest]: you know, go beyond a certain level when it comes to pricing their products.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.720
[Guest]: So this is a possibility, you know, I am not saying that this is exactly the way it will

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:42.120
[Guest]: play out because right now, you know, there is not enough data to say so but it is a possibility

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.720
[Guest]: and it needs to be discussed and the sad part is that it is not being discussed.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:51.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean to use a very loose analogy and not an exact one, if you force all chaiwalas out

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.480
[Amit Varma]: of existence, then the cheapest tea that was earlier available will simply not be available

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480
[Amit Varma]: at all.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.720
[Guest]: I mean, everybody cannot, you know, go to a restaurant, you know, a 30 rupee tea at

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.240
[Guest]: a restaurant, which is true.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.120
[Amit Varma]: So how could this have been ameliorated in the design of the GST itself?

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.800
[Guest]: I mean, that is very difficult.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.560
[Guest]: I mean, I do not think it could have been ameliorated.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:22.160
[Guest]: It is a, you see, when you make such a disruptive big change, there will be a certain cost that

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.760
[Guest]: is attached to it.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.120
[Guest]: The second thing that could have been done possibly is that, you know, the ease of doing

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.960
[Guest]: business could have been improved.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.120
[Guest]: You could have gotten rid of a lot of these labour laws or a lot of, you know, the so-called

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:42.040
[Guest]: inspector raj wherein there are, you know, at least 10 odd inspectors who can come and

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.080
[Guest]: stop your business at any point of time.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:51.640
[Guest]: So if an effort had been made in order to improve, you know, things at least, you know,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.440
[Guest]: at that level, some of these informal firms would have been in a better position right

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.880
[Amit Varma]: now than they actually are.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:03.560
[Amit Varma]: In fact, businessmen I speak to tell me about the fear of a new and improved inspector raj

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.800
[Amit Varma]: for the simple reason that now GST, because of all its exemptions and slabs and whatever,

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.040
[Amit Varma]: makes compliance impossible.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.040
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.040
[Amit Varma]: Like when I had done that episode with Devanshu, he had taken a hypothetical example of say

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.860
[Amit Varma]: there is a computer manufacturer and he is using like 30 to 300 different components

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.720
[Amit Varma]: in his computer, which he is buying from separate places.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.360
[Amit Varma]: And many of them are very vague as to which slab they go into or whatever.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.360
[Amit Varma]: So compliance is impossible and you leave it to the discretion of the inspector.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.620
[Amit Varma]: He can harass you and say that, no, KitKat is not a chocolate, it's a biscuit or the

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.600
[Amit Varma]: other way around.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:44.600
[Amit Varma]: And one of the expectations of the GST was that, for example, the long queues of trucks

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.480
[Amit Varma]: at state borders would gradually go down.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.680
[Amit Varma]: And like you mentioned before the show, there's a business standard report which says that

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.160
[Amit Varma]: that's really not happening.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.200
[Amit Varma]: Those queues are still there.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:21:00.560
[Amit Varma]: And that friction in doing business with GST was supposed to end hasn't really happened.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.760
[Guest]: So those queues are there not because of different reasons.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.200
[Guest]: It's like, you know, if you want to enter Delhi, you have to, if a truck has to enter

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.360
[Guest]: Delhi, it now needs to pay a green tax as well.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:16.360
[Guest]: So you know, a lot of taxes have been subsumed under the GST, but there are still other things

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.160
[Amit Varma]: that… So if you don't subsume, all of them is kind

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.160
[Amit Varma]: of pointless.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.160
[Guest]: Yes.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.440
[Guest]: So if you like, you know, the other great example is Gujarat.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.920
[Guest]: If you want to enter Gujarat, they'll check whether, you know, there's liquor in the

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.200
[Guest]: truck or not.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:33.600
[Guest]: So there are these, I mean, little things which are there, which do hamper the, you

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.360
[Guest]: know, smooth movement of trucks.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.320
[Guest]: But having said that, I mean, things are a little better than they were in the past.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:48.280
[Guest]: Now, you know, you were talking about KitKat, whether it's a biscuit or a chocolate.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.560
[Guest]: There was a news report in the Times of India, which essentially quotes a supermarket chain

00:21:53.560 --> 00:22:00.120
[Guest]: owner as saying, tax on snacks like aloo bhujiya, potato chips, samosa, kachori is 12%.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.840
[Guest]: Now the tax rate for cashews is 5%.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.920
[Guest]: But I can't figure out if masala cashew is a snack or a standalone item.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.880
[Guest]: So similar issues have cropped up when it comes to sweets.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.760
[Guest]: Milk sweets come under 5% bracket, but the moment a silver foil is put onto it, the tax

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.760
[Guest]: shoots up to 18%.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.760
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.760
[Guest]: Why is that?

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.760
[Amit Varma]: I have no idea.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.760
[Amit Varma]: Tax on silver.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:27.440
[Guest]: So it's like, you know, whether a particular brand of coconut oil is a cooking oil or

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.960
[Amit Varma]: a hair oil.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:36.120
[Amit Varma]: And the bizarre thing is that A, these become levers with which government inspectors can

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.800
[Amit Varma]: harass you and extort bribes, which is essentially the whole point of government inspectors.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.040
[Amit Varma]: And this is what GST was supposed to avoid.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.280
[Amit Varma]: You have one tax for G goods, one tax for S services, and that's it.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.520
[Amit Varma]: You don't have to try and figure out whether this is a chocolate or a bar of gold or whatever

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.120
[Amit Varma]: it might be, you know, and, you know, you might have 0% on some items which you want

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:03.300
[Amit Varma]: to exempt and a particularly high GST on cigarettes or whatever sinful items.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.280
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise, essentially everything is one rate.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.760
[Amit Varma]: And that isn't the case, which seems to me to defeat the purpose, because the transaction

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.880
[Amit Varma]: cost for the economy of shifting from one system to the other seems to me to be huge.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.120
[Amit Varma]: And that involves, it would seem from what you're saying about the informal sector as

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.920
[Amit Varma]: well, a huge humanitarian cost.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.960
[Guest]: I mean that, I guess we'll figure out over a period of time how that plays out.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.200
[Amit Varma]: So tell me, sorry to interrupt you.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.640
[Amit Varma]: You spoke about earlier the problem of measuring the impact on the informal sector.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.360
[Amit Varma]: And we saw this even after demonetization, where the informal sector was expected to

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.160
[Amit Varma]: be worst hit.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.400
[Amit Varma]: But there were constantly disputes over the numbers and some people actually...

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:48.280
[Guest]: No, so that was because what happens is when you calculate the GDP, what they do is because

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:53.280
[Guest]: they don't have numbers for the informal sector, they measure the formal sector, and then they

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.600
[Guest]: assume that the informal sector is a certain proportion of the formal sector.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.480
[Guest]: So that is essentially a statistical quirk, which is essentially used to calculate the

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.560
[Guest]: GDP.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:08.640
[Guest]: So what happened there was because nobody measured the impact on the informal sector,

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.920
[Amit Varma]: there was no impact on the GDP.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.080
[Amit Varma]: Which is like the tree falling in a forest, if no one is there to see it, did it fall?

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.320
[Guest]: It did fall, yeah.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:22.000
[Guest]: In fact, there are a lot of other issues also, which these multiple rates have raised.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:29.600
[Guest]: In the sense that a lot of, you know, I mean, take something like diamonds, okay, now diamonds

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:36.640
[Guest]: have been, the GST on diamonds is 0.25%, whereas the GST on matchsticks, which are, you know,

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.120
[Amit Varma]: a lot more useful than diamonds are, is 5%.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.720
[Amit Varma]: Different kinds of carbon involved.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:49.880
[Guest]: That's bizarre, I mean, I don't see any reason as to why, you know, the GST on diamonds has

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.880
[Guest]: to be so low.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:56.720
[Guest]: People might say that this is probably because, you know, we sort of import and then export

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.720
[Guest]: a lot of diamonds.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:04.280
[Guest]: So, you know, in order to ensure that India's diamond industry remains competitive globally,

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.040
[Guest]: the rates are low.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.920
[Guest]: But then, I mean, so when you have these multiple rates, it raises all these questions.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:16.120
[Guest]: So you have, you know, the GST on condoms is 0%, whereas the GST on sanitary napkins

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.120
[Guest]: is 12%.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.720
[Guest]: Now, the explanation for this is that the GST Council, which essentially decided on

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:30.760
[Guest]: these rates, their objective was to achieve what they call the best fitment, which essentially

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:36.920
[Guest]: means is that they had to ensure that the GST rate on a product was close to the overall

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.000
[Guest]: taxes on that product that were there till that point of time.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.780
[Guest]: Having said that, you know, when you look at the, you know, people who formed a part

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:50.200
[Guest]: of the GST Council, I mean, it included the finance minister of India and, you know, finance

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.800
[Guest]: minister of all the states, I mean, they could have done a little better than this.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:00.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the best fitment, the phrase in the context of condoms is, and I'm sure the council

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.720
[Amit Varma]: in question was mostly men, which is one criticism.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.480
[Guest]: In fact, they were all men, I'm sure.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.600
[Amit Varma]: But you know, at some level, that's also a diversion when you start arguing about, oh,

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.680
[Guest]: X is so much and Y is so much.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.760
[Amit Varma]: My point is, the whole point is that it's not about what should be what rate, it is

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.960
[Guest]: that they should all be one rate.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.240
[Guest]: That point is well taken.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.480
[Guest]: I am making another point.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:27.840
[Guest]: My point is, if you have different rates, at least, you know, look into what should

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.320
[Amit Varma]: be at what rate.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.520
[Amit Varma]: And the another consequence within the political economy of having different rates is that

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:40.200
[Amit Varma]: then you can give favoured rates to favoured interest groups and, you know, the political

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.320
[Guest]: corruption just goes up massively.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.520
[Guest]: I mean, that will always be there, I mean, you really cannot do much about it.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:52.480
[Guest]: I mean, take the fact that real estate does not come under GST.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.280
[Guest]: And we shall discuss that in a future episode.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.000
[Amit Varma]: Vivek, thanks so much for coming on the show.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.560
[Amit Varma]: And GST, I suspect, is a subject we will again revisit a few months from now.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.240
[Guest]: I mean, this will practically, you know, it will keep coming back.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.560
[Amit Varma]: It's going to be a recurring theme.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.640
[Guest]: Thanks a lot, Vivek.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.400
