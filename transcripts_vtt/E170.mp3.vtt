00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.360
[Amit Varma]: A quick note before you begin listening. This episode was recorded in January and was meant

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.400
[Amit Varma]: to be a timeless introduction to the world of foreign policy that you could listen to

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.200
[Amit Varma]: 30 years later and still find enlightening. I love the way the episode turned out. And

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.160
[Amit Varma]: I certainly learned a lot about the way the world functions and the motivations and incentives

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.200
[Amit Varma]: of India, Pakistan, China and the USA on the geopolitical stage. As it's a timeless episode,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.920
[Amit Varma]: I kept the release for later. And then COVID-19 happened. Now, this episode works very well

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.560
[Amit Varma]: as it is. And I think it's excellent background to understand the world today. But the fallout

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.960
[Amit Varma]: of the pandemic does have immediate implications for foreign policy. So I have recorded a special

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.160
[Amit Varma]: segment on this with my guests, Pranay and Manoj, which is attached to the end of this

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.840
[Amit Varma]: episode at around the one hour 58 minute mark. You can skip to that if you want. But I would

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.600
[Amit Varma]: recommend listening to the whole thing in linear fashion, as this entire episode was

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.120
[Amit Varma]: packed with insight for me. Happy listening.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.800
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes it feels like the planet is going nuts. The most powerful country in the world

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.480
[Amit Varma]: is led by an orange man who posts nutty tweets at 3am in all caps. He's fighting with Iran.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.720
[Amit Varma]: North Korea also has nukes. The Middle East is in turmoil. And no one knows what China

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.840
[Amit Varma]: wants except that you don't want to mess with China. India seems to have it all under control

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.440
[Amit Varma]: with the Prime Minister who seems to travel as often as an air hostess. But why does he

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.280
[Amit Varma]: keep talking about Pakistan all the time? At this point, you stop me and ask, Hey, Amit,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.220
[Amit Varma]: why do we need to look outward? There is so much going wrong in India itself. Our economy

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.600
[Amit Varma]: is bungee jumping without a rope. And our society seems more and more angry at itself.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.800
[Amit Varma]: Does the world matter? Does foreign policy matter? Why should we care?

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.560
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. In today's episode, I want to take a comprehensive look

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.360
[Amit Varma]: at international relations as things stand today. How does India look at the world? How

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.600
[Amit Varma]: does the world look at India? What are our threats and opportunities? What should we

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.240
[Amit Varma]: do? What should we not do? Through what frames do we look at all of this? My guests today

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.880
[Amit Varma]: are Pranay Kotesane and Manoj Kevalramani, two outstanding thinkers who work at the Takshashila

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.800
[Amit Varma]: Institution at Bengaluru. Both of them have been guests on the show before, and I have

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.360
[Amit Varma]: learned a lot from both of them. Some of those episodes will be linked from the show notes.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.800
[Amit Varma]: But before we begin our conversation, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.360
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to the scene and the unseen, you can play a part in keeping the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.720
[Amit Varma]: show alive. The scene and the unseen has been a labor of love. I've enjoyed putting together

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.840
[Amit Varma]: many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe, and hopefully yours

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.840
[Amit Varma]: as well. But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.320
[Amit Varma]: the show. Although the scene and the unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.280
[Amit Varma]: woken up to the insane engagement level of podcasts. I do many, many hours of deep research

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.720
[Amit Varma]: for each episode, besides all the logistics of producing the show myself, scheduling guests,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.080
[Amit Varma]: booking studios, paying technicians, the travel and so on. So well, I'm trying a new way of

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.760
[Amit Varma]: keeping this thing going, and that involves you. My proposition for you is this. For every

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.840
[Amit Varma]: episode of the scene and the unseen that you enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.440
[Amit Varma]: lunch, whatever you feel it's worth. You can do this by heading over to scene unseen dot

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.800
[Amit Varma]: i n slash support and contributing an amount of your choice. This is not a subscription.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.320
[Amit Varma]: The scene and the unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at scene unseen

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.200
[Amit Varma]: dot i n. This is just a gesture of appreciation. Help keep the scene going. scene unseen dot

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.040
[Amit Varma]: i n slash support.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.520
[Amit Varma]: Pranay and Manoj, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.160
[Amit Varma]: Great to be back, Amit. Thank you.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.280
[Amit Varma]: So Pranay, you were very recently, more recently than Manoj, you were on the scene and the

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.240
[Amit Varma]: unseen and we discussed what got you into policy and foreign policy and so on. But I

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.920
[Amit Varma]: don't think I've actually had a chance to talk about that at Manoj, though we've done

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.480
[Amit Varma]: some episodes on China, but in general, so why don't you tell me a little bit about how

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.680
[Amit Varma]: you kind of got interested in foreign policy and how it became your thing, so to say.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.800
[Guest 1]: Oh, okay. So this has to go back like nearly two decades now. Yeah, it goes back to Bollywood

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.040
[Guest 1]: dreams being shattered, and then a choice to study IR.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.040
[Guest 1]: You wanted to be an actor?

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.080
[Guest 1]: Of course. I was a Bombay person. I tried my hand at acting.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.240
[Amit Varma]: Really? What movies can we see you in?

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.240
[Amit Varma]: Fortunately, none.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.720
[Guest 2]: So Manoj tells us that those videos are not available on YouTube, but I really doubt that.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720
[Amit Varma]: Have you searched properly?

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.720
[Guest 2]: Yes, I have tried.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.880
[Guest 1]: So a challenge to all my listeners, kindly find Manoj Ke Varmani videos.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.080
[Guest 1]: I did like some of the most awesome stuff, some of the most. So, oh, as I say, in Bombay,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:17.040
[Guest 1]: I had a long struggle and I went through what are called bhajan videos and I won a beauty

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.800
[Guest 1]: pageant in Bombay in my day. So yeah, so eventually after that, I sort of moved on. I ended up

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.440
[Guest 1]: going and studying IR. And when I started international relations, it just sort of switched.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.760
[Guest 1]: I moved to journalism as opposed to foreign policy per se, but my interest was foreign

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.600
[Guest 1]: policy reportage. There was very little done in India and particularly at the grade where

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.400
[Guest 1]: I started. It took a few years once I finally went to China and I worked over there and

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.000
[Guest 1]: I came back from there. And that's when sort of the career in foreign policy, you know,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.560
[Guest 1]: studying China sort of evolved. So that's say the last five, six years when that sort

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.840
[Guest 1]: of evolved. But that's the trajectory. I went through years of journalism, about 12 years,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.320
[Guest 1]: most of some of them in India, three of them in China, and then subsequently moved out

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.040
[Guest 1]: of journalism because it just became a place from which I needed refuge. And therefore

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.760
[Guest 1]: I moved to research in foreign policy, particularly because that was my interest.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.840
[Amit Varma]: And to outsiders, it seems like a very dry subject. It's almost like the grass is green

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.240
[Amit Varma]: on the other side in this context. But you know, when I speak to both of you, I get the

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.080
[Amit Varma]: sense that you really love your jobs. You really love foreign policy. Yeah. So did you

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.800
[Amit Varma]: wake up in the morning and look forward to figuring out how the dynamic changed today?

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.080
[Guest 2]: No, it's just things keep happening, right? They never let you, your guard is never down

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.880
[Guest 2]: because something or the other is happening. So you just figure out and learn something

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.960
[Guest 1]: new. Also, I think, you know, at a certain level, and I think this doesn't operate very

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.240
[Guest 1]: consciously, but for me, at least at a subconscious level, foreign policy was always sort of one

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.160
[Guest 1]: step above covering domestic stuff. It always felt like, maybe it felt like, you know, that

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.880
[Guest 1]: is much more cooler. But it also, I guess, has to do with the fact that, you know, when

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.200
[Guest 1]: you go back to studying foreign policy, just the importance that Nehru gave to foreign

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.680
[Guest 1]: policy, I think that sort of also has a sense that, you know, okay, no, this is a bigger

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.720
[Guest 1]: deal to cover. If you're really smart, you're a strategist, you do all of this. If you're

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.280
[Guest 1]: a steezy politician, you do domestic stuff. So that's the sort of stuff that I think pays

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.480
[Guest 2]: subconsciously. Yeah, no, that's a good point. Because I've heard that earlier as well. Because

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.240
[Guest 2]: when you discuss foreign policy, it allows you to escape in a sense from what happens

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.140
[Guest 2]: in the domestic policy. So it's almost an admission that things can't change locally.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.360
[Guest 2]: So let's think of a step above. But generally, our work because we deal with public policy,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.520
[Guest 2]: it straddles both and there is not much distinction.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Controversial question. Is it simpler than say something like macroeconomics? Because

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.600
[Amit Varma]: I guess someone who's into macroeconomics is dealing with like millions of variables

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.600
[Amit Varma]: and everything is up in the air and it almost feels like they're winging it at times. Whereas

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.520
[Amit Varma]: for you guys, okay, it's more or less a zero sum game. And it's a few players. And actually,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:52.200
[Guest 2]: no, I would say both of them are equally similar that both of them are voodoo many times. Because

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.520
[Guest 2]: in macroeconomics, unlike in microeconomics, you know, right in macroeconomics, for everything

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.320
[Guest 2]: you can give a justification. Yeah, right. Similarly, in foreign policy, also, it's the

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.800
[Guest 2]: same. Yes, people can justify anything. And there is very little of outcome irrelevant

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.760
[Guest 2]: learning. So like, if you learn something which happens goes against your belief, that

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.880
[Guest 2]: updation of your Bayesian priors happens very less in foreign policy as well, you will just

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:23.520
[Guest 2]: justify Oh, yeah, this thing had to happen. Yeah, Taliban went away from Afghanistan,

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.720
[Guest 2]: I knew it would happen. You know, this US went away, Russia had come in in 79, then

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.280
[Guest 2]: the US came due to balance of power changing, they went away. So there is a lot of such

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.680
[Guest 2]: things which happen in like in microeconomics and foreign policy as well. And I think one

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.320
[Guest 1]: of the reasons is that, you know, there is so much of foreign policy that links to domestic

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.720
[Guest 1]: politics and policies in other countries, that there are so many other variables and

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.280
[Guest 1]: you don't account for when you're basically looking at the state as one entity without

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.720
[Guest 1]: looking at the internal dynamics, which is something that a lot of people end up doing.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.280
[Guest 1]: And that's where it becomes far more complicated. So yeah, what he said, I have a good example

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.760
[Guest 2]: for that, like, for example, whenever you're trying to analyse decision making of a government,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.280
[Guest 2]: what type of models will you apply, right? The basic one which will apply is rational

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:09.280
[Guest 2]: actor model. So you'll treat the state as one unitary actor, which does things in certain

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.480
[Guest 2]: ways. And but that obviously is not the right model, right? You will have to understand

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.600
[Guest 2]: better models. So there are bargaining models, or there are models which look at bureaucratic

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.360
[Guest 2]: actor models, which look at how institutions within that state perform, right? But what

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.760
[Guest 2]: happens often in foreign policies, because we don't know much about the other state,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.960
[Guest 2]: we try to analyse it as a rational actor model. So we can explain anything that China does,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.440
[Guest 2]: for example, through this rational actor model, okay, China is doing something in Sri Lanka,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:43.960
[Guest 2]: because you know, this is this, yeah, you know, it is very, that every action is calculated

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.840
[Guest 2]: as a result of something which is pursued by one actor in this state, which is not true,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.320
[Guest 2]: right? Even in a party state like China, there will be multiple actors who are having their

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.320
[Guest 2]: own interests. So in foreign policy, also, we start off with a rational actor model.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.360
[Guest 2]: But a great analysis only comes if you are able to improve that rational actor model

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:10.040
[Guest 2]: with other layers of analysis, like bureaucratic actor or bargaining. In fact, I'm reminded

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.840
[Amit Varma]: of an episode I did in the Bangladesh war with Srinath Raghavan. And a substantial part

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.840
[Amit Varma]: of that was about how the US was functioning at that time, where they were acting completely

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.760
[Amit Varma]: incoherently, because Nixon and Kissinger believed one thing and the State Department

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.440
[Amit Varma]: believed another thing. And there was a constant conflict between these. And obviously, these

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.200
[Amit Varma]: are only sort of two points. But you know, you might think you're acting with a single

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.480
[Amit Varma]: state which will act rationally, but acting with many different actors who have their

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.120
[Amit Varma]: own interests and incentives. And speaking of incentives, you know, because in your role

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:46.800
[Amit Varma]: as foreign policy analyst, you are expected to explain the world, is there then an incentive

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.680
[Amit Varma]: to simplify and create simplistic narratives, because the world in many ways is incredibly

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:57.840
[Amit Varma]: complex, you know, and not always so easy to explain, but people want bad explanations.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.480
[Guest 1]: I mean, I think there is, there is an incentive to do that. And there is a there's also a

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.600
[Guest 1]: desire to do that, because it's easier to communicate that way. And therefore, you end

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.920
[Guest 1]: up getting stuck with some of these labels. So for example, if you look at what Chinese

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.480
[Guest 1]: have been doing with Belt and Road, the narrative of Oh, this is debt wrap, this is well thought

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.440
[Guest 1]: out imposing debt on other people to take over their sovereignty or their assets. It's

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.520
[Guest 1]: one of the simplistic narratives which has gotten hold. And as much as now you try to

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.200
[Guest 1]: sort of break that saying that look, it's not necessarily that's how that's not necessarily

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.960
[Guest 1]: how it's functioning. There are so many other complications involved. It's not easily bought.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.720
[Guest 1]: I mean, from an analyst point of view, yes, there is an incentive to do that, because

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.640
[Guest 1]: that's your instant claim to a headline. But if that's what you desire, then you should

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.280
[Guest 1]: be doing that. But if that's not what you desire, and you want to get sort of below

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.680
[Guest 1]: the sort of surface of things, and I think it's, you know, I think that's the eventual

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.400
[Guest 1]: sort of bit that will get valued, the newspaper headline will go away within less than 24

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.480
[Guest 1]: hours insight, which is valuable sustains over a period of time. So as an analyst, that's

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.600
[Guest 1]: the choice that you end up having to make, you know, what is it that you want to do?

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.680
[Guest 1]: And I think that's why so that there exists an incentive. But there is this, I think,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.280
[Guest 1]: for somebody who wants to understand the world, if you're going in it to try and understand

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.600
[Guest 1]: the world, I think or try and understand how foreign policy operates, you want to sort

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.600
[Guest 2]: of step back and take a look at things better. I don't think it's very different amid compared

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:13.480
[Guest 2]: to any other discipline. For example, in economics as well, we'll always try to simplify reality

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:19.320
[Guest 2]: and model reality because you want to rational actor itself in economics is a very big concept,

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.840
[Guest 2]: right? You because by making that assumption, you are able to then see outside that individual

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.320
[Guest 2]: otherwise, you will then be stuck with why is the individual doing right. So simplifying

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.820
[Guest 2]: reality and building models is the first step, right? That's how you build on to your understanding

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.760
[Guest 2]: of the world. So I think foreign policy is something similar. So you build up models

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.320
[Guest 2]: to understand the world in better ways, you will simplify things. And the hope is that

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.440
[Guest 2]: you will then apply nuance it as you understand it. But I think the difference between building

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:53.120
[Guest 1]: a theoretical model, which explains certain consequences and actions is different as opposed

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:58.280
[Guest 1]: to simplifying reality. A theoretical model will help you evaluate or filter through realistic

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.640
[Guest 1]: events to try and say, well, these are probably the underlying causes. And these are probably

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.820
[Guest 1]: the underlying motivations, whereas actually creating a narrative to simplify what could

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.320
[Guest 1]: be very complex actions don't necessarily survive. A theoretical model will survive.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.240
[Guest 1]: I mean, things like in foreign policy, new realism and all will survive, but they will

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.560
[Guest 1]: get updated. But the theoretical base of the model will survive because it gives you one

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.400
[Guest 1]: way of looking at the world. Whereas when narratives are created, say, for example,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.840
[Guest 1]: the US's role in the Middle East is predominantly oil driven by the big mafia, whatever, by

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.000
[Guest 1]: the big oil lobbies, those are the narratives sustain themselves, but they might not necessarily

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.160
[Guest 1]: explain foreign policy in itself. Whereas a model such as realism as an approach to

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.440
[Guest 1]: things might be able to explain to you largely why certain actions are happening and why

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.720
[Amit Varma]: states behave in a certain way. In fact, you know, the pundit economy, so to say, the talking

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.120
[Amit Varma]: heads on TV and all of that, they have to exude certainty and therefore they have to

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.160
[Amit Varma]: simplify and this happened because of this and blah, blah, blah. And there's no space

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.840
[Amit Varma]: for nuance. But however, when you're analyzing something, have you guys internalized probabilistic

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:57.720
[Amit Varma]: thinking and how hard or easy is that? And you know, how difficult is it to avoid the

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.320
[Amit Varma]: temptation of giving into that and just coming to a conclusion about something and moving

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.400
[Guest 2]: on? Yeah. So I don't think we have done a lot of

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.800
[Guest 2]: work on, say, probabilistic thinking because you need a lot of data to be able to also

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.480
[Guest 2]: use some of these things. But when we talk about interstate relations, you don't have

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:20.760
[Guest 2]: that much available. But so, for example, when we try to talk about things, we try to

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:26.400
[Guest 2]: avoid certainty and certitude and the ignorance that comes with certitude we try to avoid.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.000
[Guest 2]: So we try to say even when we are predicting things, we would like to say that, you know,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.120
[Guest 2]: these are things which are likely based on our understanding of the world and the model

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.320
[Guest 2]: that we have developed. If things go awry, then we have to update our model. That's how

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.240
[Guest 1]: we think about it. Yeah. And sort of a tangent to that is I was

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.240
[Guest 1]: recently in a Twitter discussion with somebody and we were talking about some events, controversial

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.800
[Guest 1]: stuff related to China. And the answer that I got was, well, if your answer is that it's

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.840
[Guest 1]: complex and that's not good enough, you need to have a certain clarity about it. And I

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.920
[Guest 1]: was like, but it is complex. And what are you supposed to do about that? So I think

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.540
[Guest 1]: there is like this sort of ties into what you asked earlier, right? There is a pressure

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.120
[Guest 1]: to be certain about certain things. But yeah, and the best that you can do is you can create

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.000
[Guest 1]: a model and if your model sustains the test of time, that's when you know you've probably

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.160
[Amit Varma]: done well. Let's move from certainty to clarity, right?

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.360
[Amit Varma]: Now models that you describe, frames through which you view the world in any field, useful

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.840
[Amit Varma]: because then they give clarity to the way you look at the world. And of course, if the

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.680
[Amit Varma]: frame is wrong, then your clarity could be misconceived clarity. But nevertheless, frames

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.320
[Amit Varma]: are extremely useful. So what kind of frames do you have, for example, ask each of you

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.280
[Amit Varma]: this to look at sort of the world, foreign policy, international relations?

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:38.760
[Guest 2]: Yeah. So this is like talking about all the models that exist in IR, but international

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.520
[Guest 2]: relations discipline itself has some theories, right? Like, so there will be a theory of

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.680
[Guest 2]: realism. So the realism theory says that the most important determinant of anything that

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.760
[Guest 2]: happens in the world is power. So it's about who has more power, the Matsya Naya thing,

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.560
[Guest 2]: which even the cotillion things, right? Big fish eats small fish. So you have to be the

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.120
[Guest 2]: big fish. If you are a small fish, you have to ally with other small fish or big fish

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.040
[Guest 2]: to in order to resist a big fish from eating.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.040
[Amit Varma]: And that's a zero-sum view.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:13.040
[Guest 2]: Yeah, yeah. So foreign policy is seen in terms of this balancing and bandwagoning. So that

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.880
[Guest 2]: is realism. And there are other frames as well. There was a liberalism school of international

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:23.200
[Guest 2]: relations also, which said that, you know, that this is not true. Ultimately, the goal

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:30.040
[Guest 2]: of all foreign policy should be to increase liberal values. And as economies get intertwined

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.680
[Guest 2]: with each other, certain kinds of values will become more popular than others. That school

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:40.720
[Guest 2]: was discredited with what things are happening now, right? So and then there were other constructivism

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.800
[Guest 2]: that was another view, which said that it's not necessarily that states are always going

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.840
[Guest 2]: to act like this. The ultimate decisions by states are shaped by the individuals there.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.560
[Guest 2]: So as long as you can influence elite opinion in different countries, you might actually

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:01.240
[Guest 2]: achieve different outcomes. These are like three broad schools of international relations.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:08.000
[Guest 2]: Now, when I look at it, apart from these things, let's look at India, right? Indian foreign

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.680
[Guest 2]: policy, the frame that we use for looking at foreign policy, the objective that we want

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:19.400
[Guest 2]: to think about is, is any action that we do in foreign policy, is it leading to the yoga

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:25.000
[Guest 2]: kshema of Indians? Which is, is it bringing, yoga kshema means peaceful enjoyment of prosperity.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.400
[Guest 2]: So is that leading us to more yoga kshema or not? If it is not, it is a bad foreign

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.720
[Guest 2]: policy. If it is, it is going in the right direction. So, you know, we look at that.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.240
[Guest 2]: So for example, let me give you an example where it might be controversial. So many people

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.800
[Guest 2]: say, think that territorial sovereignty or territorial integrity rather is the most important

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:52.160
[Guest 2]: idea of any nation state. So the view that we come from is, it's not true to say that,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.960
[Guest 2]: you know, if yoga kshema is central to our view, there might be certain cases where you

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:02.280
[Guest 2]: might want to give away some territory in exchange of prosperity of more Indians. And

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.360
[Guest 2]: in fact, there exists a realistic case of that where India exchanged some land with

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.240
[Guest 2]: Bangladesh because there are these second order enclaves. Within Bangladesh, there is

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:15.160
[Guest 2]: India and within India, there are Bangladesh. So, and those people had, they were almost

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.040
[Guest 2]: stateless. They couldn't have any services of Indians and Bangladeshis couldn't have

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:25.600
[Guest 2]: services either. So we exchanged those lands. We, in fact, gave away more land than we got

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:32.200
[Guest 2]: in return, but that now there is consistency. Those people can have a much better life than

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.880
[Amit Varma]: they had earlier. So it is good for us. So yoga kshema is basically what Thomas Jefferson

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:43.360
[Guest 2]: would call the pursuit of happiness. Peaceful enjoyment of prosperity. Peaceful enjoyment.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.760
[Amit Varma]: So peace is also important. Yeah, the means. So the means, you have the means in the end

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.680
[Amit Varma]: right there. So when you kind of think of the world, you'd once written essay for Pragati

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.800
[Amit Varma]: when I was editing Pragati about the new world order and how, and you had kind of modified

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.520
[Amit Varma]: the conventional way of thinking and added your own sort of lens to it. Tell me a little

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.480
[Guest 2]: bit about that because I found it very insightful and fascinating. Yeah. So let's look at what

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:11.400
[Guest 2]: this term world order means, right? So the world order, this, I'm taking this definition

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:17.000
[Guest 2]: from Kissinger's book by this name. So he describes the world order as a concept held

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.040
[Guest 2]: by a region or civilization about the nature of just arrangements and the distribution

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:28.120
[Guest 2]: of power thought to be applicable to the whole world. Okay. So this is the definition. So

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.720
[Guest 2]: if this concept is applicable to the entire world, it is called an international order.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.400
[Guest 2]: If it applies only to a small region, it is called a regional order. Okay. So that is

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:42.400
[Guest 2]: what world order is. The two important words in this is just arrangements. And the second

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:48.720
[Guest 2]: concept is power distribution of power. Okay. So this is what the central theme of any world

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.160
[Guest 2]: order is. Okay. So basically just arrangement ties to this concept of legitimacy. Why is

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.460
[Guest 2]: legitimacy important? Because if you have a set of commonly accepted rules that define

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:04.880
[Guest 2]: the limits of permissible power for another state, then governing the world is easier,

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:11.240
[Guest 2]: right? So for example, when US propagated this idea of democracy, and now that was central

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.280
[Guest 2]: to many of their actions in foreign policy, whether it actually led to democracy or not

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.920
[Guest 2]: is a different thing, but it was in the name of democracy. So they build that concept and

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:26.200
[Guest 2]: because they became the most powerful nation state, all of us think in terms of that same

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.720
[Guest 2]: view, right? So now democracy, all actions of foreign policy are also seen from this

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:37.080
[Guest 2]: frame. So that becomes an important part. So that is about legitimacy. The second part

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:42.880
[Guest 2]: is distribution of power. So you will not be able to do any of these things until and

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.080
[Guest 2]: unless you have sufficient power to actually enforce things on other nations.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:54.120
[Amit Varma]: In fact, isn't the notion of just therefore also determined by power balances, like the

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:59.080
[Amit Varma]: most powerful, especially if they are hegemonically powerful, like the USA will then define what

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.120
[Amit Varma]: is just as you are saying in the case of democracy?

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:06.080
[Guest 2]: Absolutely. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's why in my definition, great powers

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:11.640
[Guest 2]: don't seek just power, they seek authority. And authority is a combination of power and

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.640
[Guest 2]: legitimacy. Okay, so basically, once they achieve power, they make certain things which

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:22.280
[Guest 2]: are in their own benefit common across the world. So democracy, free trade, for example,

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:28.360
[Guest 2]: what US thought is important for them are now seen as the gold standard by a lot of

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:33.560
[Guest 2]: countries, right? So those became the standards against which all countries started evaluating

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.920
[Guest 2]: their own foreign policy. So that is the power of so power is important.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.440
[Guest 2]: Power is everything, basically. In foreign, if we see the realism school of

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.240
[Guest 2]: international affairs, which I think more or less we agree to.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.440
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I think more or less we agree on that. I mean, Pranay has spoken about all three

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.720
[Guest 1]: concepts and what you will see, at least in my work, what you will see is you will see

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.560
[Guest 1]: all three of them being reflected that you know, there are ways in which you can leverage

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.760
[Guest 1]: leaders, individuals, institutions within a country to shape narratives and therefore

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.720
[Guest 1]: shape states policy, there is a utility, obviously, to international institutions, not just from

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.320
[Guest 1]: a cooperative point of view, which is where sort of liberal internationalism comes into

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:12.240
[Guest 1]: play. But that's also where power dynamics play out. I mean, the fact that today you

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:17.840
[Guest 1]: have, you know, the Chinese wanting to have a specific have used UN resolutions reflect

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.800
[Guest 1]: Xi Jinping thought or something like that, or shared community of common destiny is because

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.160
[Guest 1]: they see value in it. That is how you create authority. The fact that you want to end up

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:32.400
[Guest 1]: having the definition of universal human rights be altered to reflect certain particularistic

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.840
[Guest 1]: conditions of each nation so that you know, I can have my own set of human rights whereas

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.480
[Guest 1]: you can have a different set is also where you want to shape sort of these norms, because

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.000
[Guest 1]: these norms also eventually determine where authority lies. And you can see this currently

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.560
[Guest 1]: being played out between the US and the Chinese. So I think that all of this sort of has very

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.040
[Guest 1]: real world implications, which is what I wanted to sort of get at is that when you apply some

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.840
[Guest 1]: of these theories in the real world, you will not necessarily see neat distinctions, the

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.080
[Guest 1]: real world is far more messy. So you'll see these things interplaying with each other,

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:05.360
[Guest 1]: you'll see all of this happening, but power will remain sort of central to all of this.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:10.640
[Guest 1]: It is where power defined as also economic strength and that translates into military

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.560
[Guest 1]: power and the rest of it that will essentially define where you stand in the sort of global

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.600
[Guest 1]: pecking order and how much you're able to influence. And the objective of the influence,

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:23.080
[Guest 1]: like Rana said, is Yoko Shima. And that's from our point of view. But if I was to look

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.360
[Guest 1]: at and I study China, so if you look at from a Chinese point of view, the objective is

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:32.160
[Guest 1]: not necessarily Yoko Shima, the objective is broad objective is to ensure that the Communist

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:37.200
[Guest 1]: Party remains in power and maintains its control over so called dominance of leadership of

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.860
[Guest 1]: the Chinese people. However, you want to classify the Chinese people, not just who are in mainland,

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.920
[Guest 1]: but who are probably even overseas Chinese, who are probably even people of Chinese descent

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.480
[Guest 1]: living in places like Singapore, to have some sort of a legitimate authority to be speaking

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:55.960
[Guest 1]: on their behalf and governing on their behalf. And I think Yoko Shima for them is an outcome

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.920
[Guest 1]: that allows me to maintain my legitimacy, which is very different from how the means

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.560
[Guest 1]: and it's a means. So if you look at that, that's very different from how we look at

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.600
[Guest 1]: from what India's sort of foreign policy objective should be what the primary goal of our foreign

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.880
[Guest 1]: policy should be. So these can differ for different different countries in different

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:16.080
[Guest 1]: different states. And I think that's where sort of I would draw the distinction between

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.200
[Guest 1]: how we look at foreign policy for one state or another state and what sort of models can

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.040
[Guest 1]: be drawn. So Yoko Shima need not necessarily be for everybody. But that's what we believe

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.960
[Guest 2]: should be there for India. Actually, I mean, that's a perfect point for me to discuss a

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:33.200
[Guest 2]: dilemma that we face while discussing both public policy and foreign policy. So as you

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.600
[Guest 2]: know, when we are talking about the domestic sphere, we generally talk about liberalism,

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.920
[Guest 2]: pluralism, freedom of all sorts, which are close to us. But when we talk about foreign

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:49.080
[Guest 2]: policy, these principles don't necessarily apply. So in a sense, it is necessary for

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.280
[Guest 2]: us to maintain a cognitive dissonance. When we are talking about domestic policy, we talk

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.960
[Guest 2]: about freedom, pluralism, because that is the moral framework of our constitution and

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:05.960
[Guest 2]: what we want India to also be more and more free, liberal, open, etc. But that's not how

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:11.160
[Guest 2]: the international system operates. The international system is still Matsya Naya, what we discussed.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:16.400
[Guest 2]: And hence, when we talk about international relations, we have to discuss about power,

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:23.400
[Guest 2]: about amorality. So this is a conflict which exists and you have to try to balance. And

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.560
[Amit Varma]: just thinking about like one, you know, reason for that, obviously, would be that from now

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:32.080
[Amit Varma]: from the workings of society, we know enough to know that all interactions are a positive

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.880
[Amit Varma]: sum game, which is why freedom is good and coercion is bad. And that's how societies

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.920
[Amit Varma]: progress. But foreign relations is often looked upon in most of the traditional frames as

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:46.280
[Amit Varma]: a zero sum game where one country will win at the expense of another. And do you think

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.760
[Amit Varma]: then that frame needs to be modified? Because honestly, all voluntary interactions between

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:57.000
[Amit Varma]: individuals leave both people better off. That is also the same between countries. So

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.360
[Amit Varma]: is there any way perhaps like, is it a vicious cycle of thinking in zero sum terms that if

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.880
[Amit Varma]: everyone else does it, you have to also? And is there then a way of breaking that?

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:10.520
[Guest 2]: Yeah, actually, people have tried to break it through, like we discussed about constructivism

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:16.160
[Guest 2]: and other liberalism frames, they have been applied, but they haven't stood to empirical

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:22.960
[Guest 2]: scrutiny, especially liberalism as a way forward in international relations, because you still

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:28.200
[Guest 2]: see nation states, because there is no one government, nation states doing whatever it

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.800
[Guest 2]: takes to increase their own power. And they might use that increased power for betterment

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:38.560
[Guest 2]: of their own people, more liberalism, freedom inside their states. But when it comes to

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:44.320
[Guest 2]: interstate relations, the reality has been still that it is zero sum.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.200
[Amit Varma]: And as a complete aside, it also strikes me that I see a similar dissonance in everybody's

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.400
[Amit Varma]: lives, not between, you know, what if the policies they favor within the country and

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.520
[Amit Varma]: international relations, because most people aren't thinking about international relations,

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:04.040
[Amit Varma]: but simply in terms of how they think of their personal ethics, and how they think of political

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:09.480
[Amit Varma]: philosophy, like, for example, one passion project that I'm kind of working on, is sort

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:15.160
[Amit Varma]: of explain how, like, there are two important questions to which people usually have separate

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:20.200
[Amit Varma]: answers. And the first question is, what is a good way for me to live my life? What is

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:25.000
[Amit Varma]: a virtuous way for me to live my life? And the second question is, how should the state

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.200
[Amit Varma]: interact with society? And most people have separate answers to both of them. For example,

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.800
[Amit Varma]: in their personal lives, I often tell people, including leftist friends of mine that in

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:38.160
[Amit Varma]: our personal lives, we're all libertarian, we respect the autonomy of others, we don't

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.240
[Amit Varma]: coerce them, we respect their consent, you know, when you and I go out to a restaurant,

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:47.880
[Amit Varma]: we won't force each other to eat what we want that person to eat, we won't force the other

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.520
[Amit Varma]: person to pay for the meal, and so on and so forth. But it's different with the state.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.560
[Amit Varma]: And what I have come to through many years of churn and thinking and changing my mind

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:01.080
[Amit Varma]: is that I view both through the same lens, which is the lens of consent and coercion,

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:05.360
[Amit Varma]: that coercion is bad, and you have to respect consent. And that if there is something that

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:10.040
[Amit Varma]: is wrong for one individual or one group of individuals to do to another, it is also wrong

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:14.400
[Amit Varma]: for the state to do it to you. But this is a complete tangent. And I think we got on

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.200
[Amit Varma]: the tangent because you were saying we instead of I, so I apologize for that. Let's come

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:25.560
[Amit Varma]: to India then, in terms of the purpose of foreign policy, what do you think it should

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.880
[Amit Varma]: be? And you guys have both articulated that you think it should be Yogakshema. But what

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:35.200
[Amit Varma]: has it been historically in the past? What is it today? Like, is there sort of a consensus

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.480
[Amit Varma]: on this within the foreign policy establishment? Has it been changing over time? Like, you

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.760
[Amit Varma]: know, you might want to be self-aggrandizing as a nation and project power outside and

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.800
[Amit Varma]: whatever, or you could be insular like China was for the longest time and be happy as long

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.600
[Amit Varma]: as no one interferes with you. Or you could care about Yogakshema and say that, you know,

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:59.840
[Amit Varma]: our end is the prosperity of our people, peaceful prosperity, and whatever gets us that is kosher.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.280
[Amit Varma]: So you know, how have those evolved?

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:08.280
[Guest 2]: So I think on the practice side of things, it does, Yogakshema has been one of the views.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:13.240
[Guest 2]: So it's not articulated in that way, but prosperity of Indians and let's say that foreign policy

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:19.920
[Guest 2]: should actually lead to economic growth, it should help us more Indians becoming prosperous.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.120
[Guest 2]: That is sort of been the theme of foreign policy right from independence. But there

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.500
[Guest 2]: have been other elements to it as well. Like I said, territorial integrity has sometimes

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:34.400
[Guest 2]: come in as an important point of view, or extending India's power to other places. Or

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:40.280
[Guest 2]: some people are also articulated as maintaining India's predominant position in our neighborhood

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.680
[Guest 2]: might be an important view. So there have been a mix of these ideas. But because we

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:51.040
[Guest 2]: are a democracy, I think this idea of foreign policy should ultimately lead to welfare of

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:56.000
[Guest 2]: Indians is somewhat remained common over the last 50-60 years.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.480
[Guest 1]: I think it has remained common, but like Pranay said, there are multiple other strands. And

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:04.000
[Guest 1]: at least I mean, I won't necessarily go back to the 50-60s, I wasn't there. But my sense

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.160
[Guest 1]: of things at that point in time was that there was a greater interest in influencing global

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.520
[Guest 1]: events. Because that was seen, as you said, a sense of self-aggrandizement, a sense of

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.760
[Amit Varma]: we have a greater role to play.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.760
[Amit Varma]: We matter.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.040
[Guest 1]: We matter. And that's how we matter. Because when we sort of do these things, because you're

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.560
[Guest 1]: never going to matter with a country of, you know, hundreds of millions of really, really

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.640
[Guest 1]: poor people, it's going to take you a long, long time. So that, I think, was one objective

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:30.120
[Guest 1]: going back to history. I think another objective, and which I see more recently, is that foreign

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.440
[Guest 1]: policy is a tool for domestic legitimacy in terms of just popular support. The idea that

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.040
[Guest 1]: the Prime Minister over the last number of years now has gone abroad to say that, and

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.240
[Guest 1]: his supporters have gone abroad to say things like, well, have you ever seen India being

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.800
[Guest 1]: represented and spoken of so well? No, you've never seen that. And that's because of him

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:51.120
[Guest 1]: or his machinery. I think there's a sense that that sense of international, the glory

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.280
[Guest 1]: that you're getting internationally, the big crowds that are coming out there is going

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.520
[Guest 1]: to reflect into domestic pride and therefore votes and therefore political legitimacy.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.080
[Guest 1]: I think that's also something that's being used now. That's not to say that it's not

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.640
[Guest 1]: necessarily that you're not looking at development of India. I mean, when this government also

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.840
[Guest 1]: came to power the first time, the objective was economic diplomacy is going to be one

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.080
[Guest 1]: of the first things. And the objective of that is to, you know, push India's development

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.840
[Guest 1]: forward. So I think there's a mix of objectives and a lot of it in the recent past, particularly

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.800
[Guest 1]: in my recollection, the recent past, I don't recollect, say, even in the 80s, through the

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:27.200
[Guest 1]: 90s, and even the early 2000s, Prime Minister's necessarily going abroad and using your clout

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.600
[Guest 1]: abroad, or with overseas Indians as something to sell domestically saying this is how proud

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.240
[Guest 1]: we've made you with this is how big India today is at the international stage. The argument

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.320
[Guest 1]: may have been that we have growing economy and therefore we are now big and therefore

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.320
[Guest 1]: we matter. But it was never the case of this individual makes you matter now. So therefore,

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.240
[Amit Varma]: you should be voting for them. In fact, earlier when you were talking about how you know,

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.480
[Amit Varma]: with China, it's not necessarily Yogakshema, it's a communist party over everything else.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.120
[Amit Varma]: And just thinking aloud, it seems to me a danger that that could even be happened in

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:59.800
[Amit Varma]: India, where you know, if foreign validation is looked upon for, you know, as part of the

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.640
[Amit Varma]: optics that raise your brand within India itself, then that's something dangerous, it

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.840
[Amit Varma]: not need to be just it not need necessarily be at odds with, you know, what India's interest

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.880
[Amit Varma]: is. So there is, you know, one theory as to why Mr. Modi travels abroad so much, which

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:21.520
[Guest 2]: is to escape from the pollution of Delhi. For example, actually, the centrality of Pakistan

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:27.600
[Guest 2]: in India's foreign policy is a manifestation of that, right? Because ideally, in our view,

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:33.360
[Guest 2]: again, foreign policy should be about we should try to ignore Pakistan as much as possible,

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.160
[Guest 2]: right? Because you're not on the same level. Yeah, you're talking to a least common denominator,

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.600
[Guest 2]: then you're always going to compare yourself with Pakistan. Why would you do that? Right?

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:49.360
[Guest 2]: I mean, that would be defeating India's what India's wants itself to be. So as in the recent

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:54.560
[Guest 2]: years, what you're seeing is Pakistan, again, becoming a central part of India's foreign

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:59.760
[Guest 2]: policy, which it was moving away like us, for example, earlier, you if you would remember,

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:04.640
[Guest 2]: you whenever the US President came to Delhi, he also made a trip to Islamabad, like that

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:10.680
[Guest 2]: was just the normal operation. But over the last 10 years, even in the US, this had changed,

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:17.000
[Guest 2]: right? India and Pakistan were at different levels for the US. But now you see, again,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.560
[Guest 2]: this idea being that we have to do things because Pakistan look at what they are doing,

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.000
[Guest 2]: because they are doing that, why can't we do it, you know, so we are comparing ourselves

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.560
[Guest 2]: with Pakistan. And that is not necessarily leading to Yogakshem of Indians, it might

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:35.680
[Guest 2]: lead to better prospects for a particular political party, but it might not be good

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.680
[Guest 1]: for all Indians. Yeah, the only sort of corollary that I can think of in this context in the

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.560
[Guest 1]: recent past is, so if you go back to about 10-12 years ago, there was this framework

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:49.440
[Guest 1]: of Chindia, where China and India rising together, we'll make Bombay into Shanghai. That's sort

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.240
[Guest 1]: of a comparison where you are trying to compare yourself. And to me, that was healthy comparison

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:58.920
[Guest 1]: in some ways, because you were trying to look at emulating development, at least it's aspirational.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.600
[Guest 1]: But yeah, I mean, the idea that oh, this is where we are going. And you know, look, globally,

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:07.080
[Guest 1]: we're being talked about in comparison with China, and whether it's a peer now, that could

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.960
[Guest 1]: have been one way where you could sort of leverage foreign policy for domestic gain,

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.480
[Guest 1]: saying that, look, now we're in the conversation at this table. Today, that's shifted completely,

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.080
[Guest 1]: we're in a completely different table in terms of the conversation. But the idea that you

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.540
[Guest 1]: know, this comparison with Pakistan, so you spoke about the US presence previously coming

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:24.840
[Guest 1]: in this happening last year, when the Chinese foreign minister was supposed to come in September,

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:29.320
[Guest 1]: apparently, we refused him basically saying you're coming via Pakistan, and we're unhappy

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:34.040
[Guest 1]: with that. So come again, another time and don't come via Pakistan. Wow, that's a very

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:41.400
[Guest 1]: silly tantrum. Yeah. And he came in December. So, and not via Pakistan. So yeah, so I think

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:45.440
[Guest 1]: it's still a raw nerve internationally in that sense. But domestically, it probably

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.120
[Guest 1]: pays political dividends quite significantly. So you keep continuing to use that. So that's

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.520
[Amit Varma]: a trade off. And if you care much more about your domestic whatever than the Jogokshama

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.520
[Guest 2]: of your people.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.960
[Guest 2]: So just one point related to that important point of peaceful enjoyment of prosperity

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:04.960
[Guest 2]: is economic growth, right? The growth is important. So for a long time, like Nitin and all of

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:10.120
[Guest 2]: us also talk about what is India's foreign policy towards us, it is 8% economic growth.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:14.920
[Guest 2]: What is India's foreign policy towards Pakistan, it is 8% economic growth. Similarly, for against

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:20.400
[Guest 2]: many countries, it is about economic growth, right? As long as we are able to do that,

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.320
[Guest 2]: and we use foreign policy to further enhance our growth, we are on the right track. Otherwise,

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.920
[Amit Varma]: we are going in the wrong direction. And I want to elaborate on the moral importance

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:34.520
[Amit Varma]: of economic growth. Like if, for example, you agree that a democracy, your dharma is

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:39.960
[Amit Varma]: to uplift your people. Fact to remember is that every 1% rise in GDP gets 2 million people

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.880
[Amit Varma]: out of poverty, a figure which I first learned from your colleague Nitin Pai, in fact. And

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:47.400
[Amit Varma]: therefore, there is a moral imperative to growth. Therefore, when your growth slips

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:52.920
[Amit Varma]: from 7% to 4%, the opportunity cost of that is 6 million people who are still in poverty

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:57.280
[Amit Varma]: who would not have been. How is that not something to get your blood boiling? How is that any

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.560
[Amit Varma]: less than, you know, the other humanitarian crimes carried out by this regime or that?

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:06.640
[Guest 2]: Totally agree. So that's why when we talk about foreign policy, it is with this frame,

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:12.960
[Guest 2]: right? Let's talk about growth and how we can use foreign policy to increase our prospects

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:18.080
[Amit Varma]: and bring prosperity for all Indians. So I have a question about India, which is that

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.280
[Amit Varma]: however, foreign policy may sometimes be used as a tool of optics by the party in power.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:28.120
[Amit Varma]: Is it basically fundamentally run by a deep state kind of apparatus in the sense that

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:33.080
[Amit Varma]: is it just the dip, your external affairs ministry or whatever, where they have their

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.440
[Amit Varma]: carders and they have everything and they run it and therefore policy will be more or

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:43.640
[Amit Varma]: less consistent and stable through different political regimes. And, you know, politicians

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:47.440
[Amit Varma]: may use foreign policy for a little window dressing here and there, but it's really the

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:52.680
[Amit Varma]: deep state which is handling things. For example, exemplified perhaps by the appointment of

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:58.480
[Amit Varma]: Mr. Jaishankar who's, you know, a career foreign affairs bureaucrat who is now in charge of

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.960
[Amit Varma]: the external affairs ministry at the time of recording this on Jan 24. It's a strange

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:07.120
[Amit Varma]: world one never knows. So is that the case or do politicians have a greater impact? No,

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:12.880
[Guest 2]: I would say I'll give a few examples to illustrate, right? Just look at what Manmohan Singh's

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:18.800
[Guest 2]: government did with the U.S. on the nuclear deal, right? They staked their government's

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:24.960
[Guest 2]: position for that particular foreign policy action and it did have rewards, right? That

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:31.760
[Guest 2]: single decision led to India and U.S. relations being taken to a different level. So political

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.440
[Guest 2]: will, political decision making matters a lot, just like in any other foreign policy.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:42.440
[Guest 2]: So basic tenets might remain the same, just like in economic policy, broadly everyone

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:47.000
[Guest 2]: in the government also realizes that economic growth is important. But how would you want

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.880
[Guest 2]: to reach that economic growth differs, right? This government is increasing import duties

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:56.080
[Guest 2]: in the hope of saying that growth will be important. Which is bizarrely ignorant. So

00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:01.720
[Guest 2]: the actual practice might in fact be very different. So even in foreign policy, that's

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:08.160
[Guest 2]: the case. So even though people recognize that the ultimate goal is more prosperity

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:14.160
[Guest 2]: for Indians, but the practice is different and that depends on the political will, what

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.120
[Guest 1]: the government of that day and age thinks. So I mean, I think if you go back to history

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:23.200
[Guest 1]: and if you look at it, when India became independent, the political class obviously had the dominant

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.400
[Guest 1]: role in foreign policy making. I mean, Nehru ran India's foreign policy. Over time, obviously,

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.880
[Guest 1]: the bureaucracy develops and the bureaucracy gets institutionalized in certain values,

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.320
[Guest 1]: in certain sense of what our interests are and what our approaches are. Subsequently

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.200
[Guest 1]: making sort of pivoting is very difficult because that's where I think sort of deep

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:43.640
[Guest 1]: state in the sense sort of fixes in. And if you look at, if you listen to former bureaucrats,

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:48.160
[Guest 1]: former IFS folks, former ambassadors, you get that sense that there is a certain viewpoint

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.800
[Guest 1]: that they come from and to take some of those leaps and one of the leaps was what Pranay

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.720
[Guest 1]: mentioned, which was the nuclear deal. It was a very, very difficult process to go through

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:02.120
[Guest 1]: that and there's a lot of not just political, but also bureaucratic sort of pushback against

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:06.000
[Guest 1]: something like that. But that's made and that's again where the political class sort of intervenes.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.080
[Guest 1]: I think today what you see is that there is an institutionalized sense and I think this

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.560
[Guest 1]: has to go back to the nuclear deal in that period of time over 10-12 years now. The sense

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:19.560
[Guest 1]: that, actually not even 10-12 years ago, I think this goes back to the late 90s after

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:23.240
[Guest 1]: we conducted the nuclear tests and the subsequent dialogue. Again, this is a political level

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.200
[Guest 1]: dialogue happening between Stuart Talbot and Juswan Singh and that shapes narratives.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.360
[Guest 1]: And then it takes us still about 10 years after that to do this nuclear deal, finalize

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.360
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.800
[Amit Varma]: But the dialogue happened through regimes, which is interesting.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.640
[Guest 1]: The dialogue began with Juswan Singh and Stuart Talbot and that was the dialogue with sort

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.640
[Guest 1]: of normalized things, which is when Bill Clinton visited India in 2000. After that, and that

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.920
[Guest 1]: was a big deal, right? Sanctions were placed against India and then Bill Clinton comes

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:50.040
[Guest 1]: to India eventually. Subsequently, it takes about five years where we end up announcing

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.440
[Guest 1]: this possibility of a nuclear deal. And even this possibility of the nuclear deal in the

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.760
[Guest 1]: US, there is a pushback because this is George Bush wanting to do it and us taking on the

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.200
[Guest 1]: opportunity with that. But there is a pushback in the US also, which led to therefore that

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.280
[Guest 1]: 1-2-3 agreement going through such a long discussion. Even in India, there is resistance

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.560
[Guest 1]: and that's why it takes you eventually so long. When you reach the agreement, subsequently,

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.800
[Guest 1]: if you see whatever subsequent governments have sort of felt, whatever sort of the environments

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.880
[Guest 1]: have been, there have been certain sort of constants in how we've approached it. We've

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:22.000
[Guest 1]: moved closer to the US, we've tried to balance the Chinese and we've tried to also figure

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.560
[Guest 1]: out a way where we can maintain economic growth in whatever way we can. And that's been sort

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.520
[Guest 1]: of broadly our priorities without trying to get too controversial. We've tried to sort

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.960
[Guest 1]: of keep somewhere equidistant where we don't get caught up in controversies, managing our

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.280
[Guest 1]: relationship with Iran and the US pressure on Iran and all those things. To me, part

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:42.120
[Guest 1]: of that is political. But part of that is also how the bureaucracy sort of seeks stability

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:46.640
[Guest 1]: because certain values get entrenched, certain opportunities, certain senses get entrenched.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.560
[Guest 1]: And then it's very difficult. You need something where the political establishment sort of

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:55.360
[Guest 1]: pushes hard, bangs on heads and then you sort of push through something which can be transformative.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:00.420
[Guest 1]: So if today you were to ask somebody who feels that India must pivot, the world is changing

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:05.600
[Guest 1]: drastically, India must pivot towards some sort of an alliance with the US, you will

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:09.680
[Guest 1]: find a lot of inertia within the bureaucracy. You will find a lot of former ambassadors

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:13.920
[Guest 1]: and bureaucrats saying, no, no, no, that's going too far. We can talk, we can do this

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.160
[Guest 1]: and we can sort of find some sort of a modus vivendi, but we don't necessarily want to

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.920
[Guest 1]: go down that road. And that's because you're institutionalising certain thought processes

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.400
[Guest 1]: about risk taking, about where our interests lie and how our interests are sort of being

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.040
[Guest 1]: shaped by the events. But you won't necessarily anticipate it because you're institutionalising

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.120
[Guest 1]: those things. So I think there is a deep state which gets entrenched over a period of time.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.400
[Guest 1]: There are points of time in India's history where politicians have sort of dominated this

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:41.480
[Guest 1]: particular foreign policy framework. Yet I think for in much of post Nehruvian era, it's

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.840
[Guest 1]: been the bureaucracy which has driven things. There have been moments where the politicians

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.200
[Guest 1]: have sort of taken charge, but much of the time it's I think it's a bureaucracy that's

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.200
[Guest 1]: maintained things the way they are.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:56.640
[Amit Varma]: So would it be fair to say that there is therefore a status quo bias at play that among bureaucrats

00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:00.640
[Amit Varma]: that the safest thing is to do nothing because nothing can go wrong and you can't be blamed

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:05.240
[Amit Varma]: for doing, you know, the usual whatever it is that you do. And therefore, if any drastic

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.440
[Amit Varma]: actions or big changes from the past have to be done, they have to necessarily come

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.440
[Amit Varma]: from politicians.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:14.680
[Guest 2]: Yes, I would agree with that. So there is a very famous quote in international which

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:19.920
[Guest 2]: gets misused a lot is about there are no permanent friends or enemies, only permanent interests.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:25.320
[Guest 2]: Now let me corrupt it further and say that interests are semi-permanent. Okay, the interests

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:30.640
[Guest 2]: also change but they are semi-permanent. So that's why you will see the status quo bias

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:36.160
[Guest 2]: in the sense that largely interests of India across these have also remained the same and

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:41.080
[Guest 2]: they have changed not with every government, but they have changed over say 20-30 years

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:45.640
[Guest 2]: because you know, your interests will change if, when will they change? When your entire

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:50.440
[Guest 2]: power in the international order also changes, right? Let's say if you have acquired more

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:55.800
[Guest 2]: economic power or more military power, you have that many more instruments to achieve

00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:01.280
[Guest 2]: something, right? Let's say you want to ensure that Indians who are working in the Gulf are

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:06.400
[Guest 2]: protected. But if you don't have a Navy to back that up, there's not much you can do.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.160
[Guest 2]: You will do status quo. You will just say, okay, have good relations with all countries

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.320
[Guest 2]: in West Asia, balance all of them. Yeah, but that's pretty much it, right? But now imagine

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:20.040
[Guest 2]: India is a much more powerful country in terms of the economic wherewithal and also in terms

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:25.680
[Guest 2]: of military strength, then we can deploy things there. We can also have relationships with

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:31.320
[Guest 2]: other countries, which will ensure that in times of emergency, Indians are repatriated

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:37.860
[Guest 2]: in a much better way, right? So the dependence is on our own power. And if we have more power,

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:42.960
[Guest 2]: it might not necessarily be status quo. We can do many more things. We can deliver pain

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:48.200
[Guest 2]: to countries which act against us. And we can also provide benefits to countries which

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.360
[Guest 2]: act according to us.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.720
[Amit Varma]: And what also strikes me here is that using the realist frame and putting power at the

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:59.360
[Amit Varma]: center of everything means that India is playing multiple games at the same time. Like on one

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:04.040
[Amit Varma]: hand, you have the US as this large power, and India has a history of not being particularly

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:08.120
[Amit Varma]: close to them during the Cold War and so on. So, you know, there is this constant game

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:12.000
[Amit Varma]: you're playing where you're trying to sort of maintain national pride, but also get closer

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.560
[Amit Varma]: to them and make them friendlier towards you. And at the same time, within the region, you

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:21.000
[Amit Varma]: are the big boy in South Asia, and you want to sort of use that to consolidate your influence.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.600
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, you're very aware that China is doing things in your neighborhood

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:29.080
[Amit Varma]: in the Indian Ocean. And you also have therefore the imperative of at least balancing that

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:33.420
[Amit Varma]: and looking after your interests. How is Indian thinking on all of these and we can go one

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:38.640
[Amit Varma]: by one and not necessarily try to do a broad sweep one by one. If we talk about our attitude

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:43.240
[Amit Varma]: towards the USA, towards China, towards the region, how has that sort of evolved over

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.240
[Amit Varma]: the last 20-30 years?

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:50.680
[Guest 2]: So, let's look at US first, probably. So, on the US, there was this article that an

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:56.280
[Guest 2]: interview that K Subramaniam gave for Pragati itself long back, where he articulated that

00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:01.920
[Guest 2]: if the world is going to be such that US is the number one and China is number two in

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:08.160
[Guest 2]: the world, it is in India's interest to ensure that US is number one. So, that was sort of

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:14.560
[Guest 2]: his articulation. But so, broadly, Indian foreign policy has taken that trend that US

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:20.480
[Guest 2]: is important, even though there is very strong anti-Americanism in our, because of our previous

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:25.320
[Guest 2]: history, Cold War, closeness with Russia and all that. But look at India, right? Our median

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:33.000
[Guest 2]: age is 27. Most of the people are born after liberalization. So, and we all have had, you

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.760
[Guest 2]: know, even at a cultural level, US has been close, right? Many people in Bangalore have

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:45.320
[Guest 2]: worked for US companies, including me. So, there is that anti-Americanism, I think is

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:50.880
[Guest 2]: slowly fading away. And that is a recognition from the US side as well, because the US game,

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:56.920
[Guest 2]: big game is US is worried about China. And it realizes that to counter China, it needs

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:02.120
[Guest 2]: a player, a middle power, which is of significant strength, which at the current stage only

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:08.480
[Guest 2]: is India. So, now you see a convergence of both US wanting, seeing India at a different

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:14.360
[Guest 2]: level than other players like Pakistan. And India also moving away from that anti-American

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:20.560
[Guest 2]: attitude, which existed 20-30 years ago. So, over the last 10 years, there has been more

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:25.960
[Guest 2]: convergence and US-India relationships have been much better than they were 20-30 years

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.640
[Amit Varma]: ago. And is there a sort of balancing to be done

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:33.120
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that we also want good relations with China? But is there a sort of balancing

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:37.800
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that if they see us get too close with the US, they might get pissed off?

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:42.400
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I mean, so there was a news report last week, which spoke about a Trump staffer, I

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.320
[Guest 1]: think it was Scaramucci, but I can't remember which Trump staffer, but a former Trump staffer

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:50.160
[Guest 1]: essentially saying that when Modi met Trump, Trump asked him, Trump, they were talking

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.560
[Guest 1]: about China and Trump sort of made a remark saying, it's not like China is next to you,

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:58.120
[Guest 1]: right? It's not like it's on the border with you. So, it is on the border with us, of course.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:03.040
[Guest 1]: And so, it's not just the fact that China is a large neighbour, which is next to us,

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:09.120
[Guest 1]: which enjoys a massive asymmetry with us. China's per capita GDP today is over $10,000,

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:15.040
[Guest 1]: five times more than ours. Its capacity to use its economic resources to create military

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:19.760
[Guest 1]: power is far, far superior than ours. So, it enjoys a massive asymmetry from us. Secondly,

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:25.360
[Guest 1]: we've got this long pending border dispute, which continues to be an irritant. Thirdly,

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.520
[Guest 1]: China is one of our biggest trading partners. Our trade with the Chinese is today at $92,

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.000
[Guest 1]: $93 billion a year. There's increasing Chinese investment coming in India. So, that's an

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.840
[Guest 1]: opportunity. In the last three, four years, there's been about $9, $10 billion worth of

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:42.000
[Guest 1]: Chinese investment coming in, largely in India's tech sector. But apart from that, also in

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.320
[Guest 1]: construction and other things. So, there's an opportunity that it presents, but there's

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.680
[Guest 1]: also a threat that the Chinese present, which is the fact that they are not just an asymmetrically

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:54.000
[Guest 1]: large neighbour sitting next door to us with a border dispute from us. They also have a

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.240
[Guest 1]: very close relationship with Pakistan, which is a fundamental irritant for India in its

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.560
[Guest 1]: trajectory to grow further. And there's long standing hostility with the Chinese have sort

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:07.720
[Guest 1]: of furthered by helping develop Pakistan's weapons, nuclear industry. And it's furthering

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:12.680
[Guest 1]: that also right now, because it's also investing in Pakistan's Navy right now. And as that

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:16.480
[Guest 1]: sort of develops, it creates more problems over India. Because, I mean, everybody remembers

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:20.680
[Guest 1]: the Masood Azhar saga, where the Chinese constantly supported Masood Azhar's, the not listing

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.520
[Guest 1]: of Masood Azhar as a UN designated terrorist. So, there are these fundamental contradictions

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.200
[Guest 1]: that we have with China. There's an opportunity there and there's a threat there. And my sense

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.680
[Guest 1]: is that what we should be doing and what we are trying to do, although we're not necessarily

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:36.020
[Guest 1]: doing as well as we could have, is to try and not just balance it in terms of our relationship

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:40.360
[Guest 1]: with America, and also trying to invest in our domestic capacities, because that's fundamentally

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.000
[Guest 1]: what is going to be needed to deter the Chinese. So, this is a four step thing that we need

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.940
[Guest 1]: to do. We need to engage with them. We don't necessarily engage with them well. Our engagements

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:52.640
[Guest 1]: have been, at leader levels, yes, we do engage. You know, before even Modi was meeting Xi

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.760
[Guest 1]: Jinping for informal summits and sipping coconuts, you know, there were meetings between Indian

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.200
[Guest 1]: leaders and Chinese leaders. I mean, Manmohan Singh and Hu Jintao met a number of times

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.680
[Guest 1]: and that's when sort of the big bonhomie was happening. So, that's one thing. But also

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:08.680
[Guest 1]: at sort of society levels, governmental levels, institutional levels within governments, at

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.320
[Guest 1]: different levels, we need to be engaging with them because we don't necessarily understand

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:17.160
[Guest 1]: how that system operates. And a classy example is the engagements at our armed forces. The

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:22.000
[Guest 1]: fact that India and China have been talking about setting up a hotline, a crisis de-escalation

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.200
[Guest 1]: hotline between the armed forces for years now, at least publicly this government said

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:31.000
[Guest 1]: so two years ago. And it just announced this month that we are in a position where a hotline

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.560
[Guest 1]: will be set up. And the reason that you couldn't set this hotline up is because India said,

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.960
[Guest 1]: we have the Director General of Military Operations, that person will be in charge. Who is your

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.880
[Guest 1]: equivalent at that side? And neither could we, neither could they identify the equivalent.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.640
[Guest 1]: So just this sort of sense of lack of understanding of each other's systems and sort of being

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.040
[Guest 1]: able to harmonise that. So, we need to engage with them. We also need to balance them, which

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.360
[Guest 1]: is what we are doing with the US, which is what we're doing when we partner with Japan,

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.840
[Guest 1]: with Australia, this idea that we are building up this quadrilateral group, which is not

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:02.280
[Guest 1]: an alliance, but some sort of a loose coming together of like-minded countries. Most important

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.760
[Guest 1]: to this is not the fact that we have these countries working with us, but the fact that

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:09.960
[Guest 1]: we work with them to develop our own capacity, our own military capacity. And we're sort

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:14.400
[Guest 1]: of gradually taking steps to do that. In terms of deterrence, the capacity building will

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.800
[Guest 1]: work. Nuclear weapons are an important part of the deterrence, but also the fact that

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.720
[Guest 1]: we need to be able to bolster our border defences, we need to be able to build infrastructure,

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:26.240
[Guest 1]: we need to be able to spend on our Navy. And for all of this, our economy is fundamental.

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:31.980
[Guest 1]: And the last bit over there, in terms of this framework of engagement, balancing, deterrence

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:36.080
[Guest 1]: is collaboration. And that's where I sort of tie in the economy. The Chinese today are

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.960
[Guest 1]: massively capital rich, they want to spend money, they want better returns. India can

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:43.560
[Guest 1]: potentially offer a market where they can get better returns. We've not been able to

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.160
[Guest 1]: attract the kind of investment, although there's 8 and 9 billion that I've said about, but

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:50.200
[Guest 1]: there's much more investment from the Chinese that could come into dummy infrastructure,

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.600
[Guest 1]: which hasn't come in. They're doing this around the world, but they're not doing this in India.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.440
[Guest 1]: We should be trying to attract that money in, and that requires regulatory clarity in

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:00.600
[Guest 1]: India. So that's where we need to collaborate with them, not just on infrastructure, but

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:04.880
[Guest 1]: also maybe on say digital technologies, talking to them about cyber governance and these sorts

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.360
[Guest 1]: of things, talking to them about data protection, which are all going to be norms which are

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.520
[Guest 1]: going to be shaped internationally. And we need to work with them on these things to

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.960
[Guest 1]: be able to collaborate where we can, leverage what we can to be able to then build our capacity

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.560
[Guest 1]: and deter them. So yes, while we build our relationship with the US, this is a neighbor

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.720
[Guest 1]: on our border, which we need to manage well. And this is a framework through which we can

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.720
[Guest 2]: manage them.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:29.280
[Guest 2]: I just want to tie that into the US-India question. So broadly, the way I see it as

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:35.200
[Guest 2]: India's US relationship, there are three schools of thought. One is purely a retaliatory school

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:39.040
[Guest 2]: of thought, which says, why should India do anything to the US because US keeps supporting

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:45.520
[Guest 2]: Pakistan still. It still supports the Pakistani military. It gives F-16s to them and all that.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:49.720
[Guest 2]: So that's a retaliatory school in nature. It is very low on realism because it is not

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:54.720
[Guest 2]: taking into account what US can do to India, the benefits it can give. That is one school

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:58.560
[Guest 2]: of thought. The second school of thought is purely bandwagoning, which I told you about

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:04.120
[Guest 2]: that we should try to ensure that India, if US is the number one and China is number two,

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:08.160
[Guest 2]: US should be number one. We should try to prolong that. The third school of thought

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:12.320
[Guest 2]: is what Manoj was talking about and what we sort of believe in about India trying to be

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:17.680
[Guest 2]: a swing power. Basically, India's capability should be that it should be able to deliver

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:22.640
[Guest 2]: pain to an adversary if it does not act according to our interest, and it should be able to

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:28.080
[Guest 2]: deliver benefits if it does. So that is how we should look at US and China as well. And

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:34.120
[Guest 2]: so issue by issue, we can decide where we want to be on. So it is called like another

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:38.520
[Guest 2]: analogy for this is we shouldn't be in anyone's camp, but we can be in different tents at

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:44.320
[Guest 2]: different times. So you could be on, for example, on climate change, India could have more close

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:50.520
[Guest 2]: relationship with China. But on certain other things, US is more important for India. So

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:56.260
[Guest 2]: it requires a balance. We don't need... India is a big enough power to be able to do that.

00:52:56.260 --> 00:53:00.600
[Guest 2]: If you ask this question to a small nation state, it's very tough for them to do any

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:06.040
[Guest 2]: of this balancing because their own power is less. But because India is a significant

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:11.000
[Guest 2]: power, and we hope it remains so with growing economic strength, then its ability to do

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.760
[Guest 2]: this balancing, be in different tents at different times will improve over time. And it also

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:20.440
[Amit Varma]: strikes me when you were talking about deterrence against China, it also strikes me that perhaps

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:27.320
[Amit Varma]: a stronger deterrent than say nuclear bombs is a strong economy, because then their incentives

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:31.920
[Amit Varma]: because you know, they make so much money from our economy that their incentive is to

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:37.000
[Amit Varma]: keep us healthy, but that doesn't work for Pakistan. So while we need carrots with China,

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.320
[Amit Varma]: perhaps these kind of positive some carrots, we need sticks with Pakistan, would that be

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:45.320
[Guest 1]: a fair characterization? So I'd say that we need a bit of both with China, we need to

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:50.000
[Guest 1]: be able to have the capacity and display the resolve to be able to inflict pain, but we

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.120
[Guest 1]: need carrots because it is beneficial to us also. And the fact that over the last 60-65

00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:00.200
[Guest 1]: years, we've been able to manage the border tensions without any major incidents, the

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:04.520
[Guest 1]: Chinese have not sort of protruded inside India, they've not even sought to, there have

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.920
[Guest 1]: been differences, which cause incursions and those sorts of things. But there's nothing

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.800
[Guest 1]: that that's been large scale. And there's nothing that tells us that there will be something,

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:15.280
[Guest 1]: you know, at a massive scale going forward. Likewise, with India, India has not tried

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:19.440
[Guest 1]: to push through sort of established lines apart from, I mean, as much as we keep reporting

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:24.160
[Guest 1]: Chinese border incursions, they do the same thing, Indian border incursions. So that's

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:27.960
[Guest 1]: a perceptual issue. And that happens. Yes, there's also it's but the fact is that it's

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:32.480
[Guest 1]: also a pain point for us, which the Chinese tend to leverage also. So it's not just innocent

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:36.400
[Guest 1]: perception. It's also thought out sort of approach to this. In terms of carrots, yes,

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.480
[Guest 1]: we need carrots. I think this is one place where sort of we in the office tend to have

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:44.240
[Guest 1]: a discussion about is that can these carrots influence Chinese policy? What evidence has

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:48.080
[Guest 1]: shown us that in certain cases, it can in certain cases, it won't. So for example, when

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.400
[Guest 1]: the Chinese ended up entering into a sort of conflict with the Japanese, this phase

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:57.520
[Guest 1]: of tension starting from 2012 onwards, over the disputed islands between the two countries,

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:03.200
[Guest 1]: you ended up realizing that the Chinese were willing to bear economic costs, whether it

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:07.120
[Guest 1]: was to Japanese businesses in China, or whether it was sort of dealing with cutting off ties,

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.600
[Guest 1]: sort of restricting hurting Chinese exports and all those sorts of things. They were willing

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:15.000
[Guest 1]: to deal with economic costs. In the case of the US right now, and sort of tensions between

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.280
[Guest 1]: the Americans and the Chinese, what you're seeing is that they're again willing to bear

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:23.480
[Guest 1]: economic costs for strategic objectives. Yet, when those economic costs start to hurt the

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:28.000
[Guest 1]: stability of the party, that's when it becomes far more important. So it might not necessarily

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.800
[Guest 1]: be a case where a certain large, certain set of large industry sort of lobbies can get

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:36.720
[Guest 1]: together and influence the government in China, like they could probably in the US or probably

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:41.640
[Guest 1]: in India, to alter policies, soften policy or do something like that. But when those

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:47.200
[Guest 1]: industries are critical to survival for the Communist Party, you'll end up seeing them

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:52.600
[Guest 1]: sort of altering course, it might not just be sort of the profit margins being hurt badly.

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:56.240
[Guest 1]: So I think that is what we need to keep in mind when we try to take, if our carrots are,

00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:00.640
[Guest 1]: the purpose of the carrots is to sort of try and shift policy over a period of time, it

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.840
[Guest 1]: has to be focused with sort of very clear sort of precision that what are you looking

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:07.040
[Guest 1]: at, where are you targeting, it might not necessarily be sufficient just because you're

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:11.000
[Guest 1]: a large enough market where you can, where they are making 100 billion dollars a year,

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.120
[Guest 1]: that might not essentially be sufficient. So there may be a lot more that needs to be

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.120
[Guest 2]: done.

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:18.720
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I look at it from like an insurance policy, right? You need an insurance when

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:23.960
[Guest 2]: things go wrong, right? Similarly, I articulate what India's policy towards China should be

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:29.040
[Guest 2]: in two parts. One is what Manoj said about part one, we need Yogakshema, it's in our

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:33.320
[Guest 2]: national interest that there are more investments, there is peace on the border. So whatever

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:37.320
[Guest 2]: requires to be done with China on that we should do, we should allow Chinese investments

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:42.120
[Guest 2]: in a lot of at least the dump infrastructure in India, definitely a yes, right? But we

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:47.920
[Guest 2]: also need an aggressive China insurance policy. So what if, because China's recent movements

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:56.480
[Guest 2]: have been in Maldives, Nepal, Doklam are quite indicative that it is ready to take openly

00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:01.600
[Guest 2]: hostile relationship with its neighbors, not just India, it has been the case with many.

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:08.480
[Guest 2]: So we need at least some instruments to be able to deliver pain to China if it tries

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:14.360
[Guest 2]: this, right? So for example, some things, the insurance premium for this policy would

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:19.920
[Guest 2]: include a variety of measures, for example, establishing at least contacts with key members

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:24.960
[Guest 2]: of the World Uyghur Congress, for example, because that is a pain point for them. Shifting

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:30.640
[Guest 2]: the focus of our Act East and Look East policy to just one country, Vietnam, for example,

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:36.960
[Guest 2]: because it is a country which also has a historic problem with China in its neighborhood. Third,

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:42.360
[Guest 2]: offering Trump deals that can actually deepen the US-India engagement. And fourth, actually

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:47.480
[Guest 2]: sponsoring studies that puncture the Chinese leaders do no wrong narrative, because that's

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:51.520
[Guest 2]: a very strong thing. Everything in China is planned and everything they do is a success.

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:57.840
[Guest 2]: Dear leader is never wrong, sounds familiar, Indian listeners. So these are just, this

00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:02.200
[Guest 2]: is not a comprehensive list by any means, but these are some things which we can develop

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:06.160
[Guest 2]: our strength in so that if things go wrong with China, we at least have well-developed,

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:10.800
[Guest 1]: crafted instruments. Yeah, I think the only, the one thing that I would add to this is,

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:15.080
[Guest 1]: you know, our relationship with Taiwan. The fact that we've not really been able to leverage

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:19.320
[Guest 1]: that relationship at all, which apart from just as an insurance policy with regard to

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:23.080
[Guest 1]: China is also useful from the point of view of our own technological development. Given

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:26.800
[Guest 1]: that we want to talk about indigenizing semiconductors and all of that, we need to work with the

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:30.560
[Guest 1]: Japanese. And I don't think we've done enough. I mean, I, we just had elections in Taiwan

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:34.560
[Guest 1]: and for whom I had put out on social media that it would be nice to see the Indian government

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:39.480
[Guest 1]: put out a statement saying that, you know, congratulations, well, you know, good elections

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:44.400
[Guest 1]: and you know, congratulations on peaceful transfer of power and just as generic as that,

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:47.920
[Guest 1]: without even using the word president side, because we don't recognize Taiwan as a state,

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:51.120
[Guest 1]: but just congratulating them. When the Australians can, when the Americans can, why can't we?

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.640
[Guest 1]: It might, it will urge the Chinese, of course, it'll urge the Chinese, but it won't take

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.920
[Guest 1]: you for granted. Yeah, they won't take you for granted. So I don't see why we don't do

00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.400
[Guest 1]: that and why we've also sort of become far more soft on Tibet. These are complicated

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:05.640
[Guest 1]: issues for the Chinese that are going to remain complicated for the next, at least for the

00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:08.880
[Guest 1]: next decade plus. Taiwan's going to be there for a longer period of time, but given that

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:13.240
[Guest 1]: the Dalai Lama is aging and his health hasn't been the best, Tibet's going to be a complicated

00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.720
[Guest 1]: issue for the Chinese. I don't know how much we've done to sort of nurture some of these

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:20.560
[Guest 1]: pain points. I don't think we've done sufficient. In fact, what we've done in the last few years

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:24.360
[Guest 1]: is that we've actually rolled back some of the pressure that we apply on this. So when

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.760
[Amit Varma]: you say nurture the pain points, you're saying keep it alive as an issue. Yes. So they are

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.760
[Amit Varma]: wary of messing too much with you on other fronts because you could mess with them on

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.100
[Guest 1]: this front, basically. To me, the fact is that the fact that we are no longer even issuing

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:39.440
[Guest 1]: statements to any regard tells you of the fact that you, I mean, I don't know what capacity

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.840
[Guest 1]: we'd have in Tibet, if we have any, I don't. The fact that we are no longer even talking

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:46.440
[Guest 1]: about it tells you that we probably have no capacity. If you had some capacity, you would

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:51.400
[Guest 1]: talk about it because empty talk is otherwise useless. So I presume that we've not nurtured

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:54.960
[Guest 1]: that capacity. And if you've not done that, therefore we're not talking. So I think we

00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:59.680
[Guest 2]: should be looking to do some of these things. Actually, we're going the other direction,

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:04.040
[Guest 2]: because Pakistan has become again important for this government. The opportunity cost

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:08.560
[Guest 2]: of that is that we are not going to be looking at China with such, with all these instruments.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:13.000
[Guest 2]: We're not going to develop them. In fact, we are going to need China on our hand to

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.920
[Guest 2]: take on Pakistan. And for just the case of that Masood Azhar listing is a classic case

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:23.520
[Guest 2]: because it is so important to us. We want China's support for that delisting and all

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:28.880
[Guest 2]: cannot happen. So we are going in the other direction by making Pakistan the focus of

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.560
[Amit Varma]: our foreign policy. And we shall make Pakistan the focus of our conversation after we come

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:43.560
[Amit Varma]: back commercial break.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:21.880
[Amit Varma]: commercial break.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:26.840
[Amit Varma]: My recommendation for this week is a selfish gene by Richard Dawkins. This is a landmark

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:32.400
[Amit Varma]: book of popular science writing that explains how natural selection functions through the

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.200
[Amit Varma]: medium of genes. It's an eye opening book. And if you're not familiar with the subject,

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.240
[Amit Varma]: the world will never look the same after you're done with this. So do check it out in Storytel.

[Amit Varma]: that Storytel with a single l Storytel.com.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:57.120
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Pranay Kutasane and Manoj Keval

01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.880
[Amit Varma]: Romani on foreign policy. And we've sort of been talking about how India looks at first

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:06.960
[Amit Varma]: the US and then China, and now Pakistan. And Pranay, I remember a couple of years back,

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:13.640
[Amit Varma]: if my memory serves me right, we actually did an episode on why China's renewed interest

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:17.200
[Amit Varma]: in Pakistan could actually be a good thing for India and not a threat.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:23.800
[Guest 2]: Yeah, we did that with regards to what China was doing in CPEC, etc. Yeah, I remember that.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:30.640
[Guest 2]: So my thing about Pakistan and India's relationship with Pakistan is, yeah, we need to move away

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:37.480
[Guest 2]: from what we are doing, move away from that focus and defocus, actually, Pakistan, even

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:42.280
[Guest 2]: when we are talking about the subcontinent. So there are, for example, Bangladesh is a

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:47.760
[Guest 2]: country we should be really investing our subcontinent policy for, right? All our energy

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.760
[Guest 2]: should be that because it is a big country. It has, it is our largest export for our two-wheeler

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:58.920
[Guest 2]: market now, for example. And there are a lot of tourists which come from Bangladesh to

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.120
[Guest 2]: India, a significant number. The economy is also doing much better than us. The per capita

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:08.000
[Guest 2]: GDP is more than that of Pakistan now. So there are lots of good things. And we need

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
[Guest 2]: Bangladesh because we need to be able to, the connectivity between India's northeast

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.200
[Guest 2]: part and the other parts of India is quite weak. And we need Bangladesh to help us get

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:23.640
[Guest 2]: through Bangladesh to say Mizoram and Tripura. And Bangladesh is very important. We have

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:29.440
[Guest 2]: done trials also of moving goods through that. So Bangladesh is important. So actually, my

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.520
[Guest 2]: thing about Pakistan is just keep an eye on the Pakistani military jihadi complex, which

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:40.960
[Guest 2]: we have spoken about. And as long as we have enough capability to avert the worst things

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:45.560
[Guest 2]: that Pakistani military jihadi complex does to us, the foreign policy idea should think

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.720
[Guest 1]: of other things and not Pakistan. I agree with that completely. I'm just going to slightly

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:54.600
[Guest 1]: rephrase it. I think our security policy can deal with Pakistan because I mean, when you

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.880
[Guest 1]: engage with folks in the Indian armed forces, the one thing that they'll tell you is that

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:02.000
[Guest 1]: we get that we need to reorient towards China. The new army chief says we are doing some

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.760
[Guest 1]: sort of rebalancing and the balancing is to correct historical issues where we are balancing

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.880
[Guest 1]: towards the northern frontier. Yet when you engage with people in the armed forces, what

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.920
[Guest 1]: they'll tell you is that, what do you do? There's a constant barrage from that side.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.880
[Guest 1]: So how do you sort of reorient? It's a difficult thing to reorient. Conceptually, it makes

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:20.040
[Guest 1]: sense to us also, but how do you do it practically? So, and I think the difference there is that,

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.480
[Guest 1]: you know, you get your security policy needs to take into account what you need to do to

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.960
[Guest 1]: deal with the threats that emerge from the military jihadi complex. The problem is when

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:31.640
[Guest 1]: that gets transported into your domestic narrative, into your foreign policy priorities, and that

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:38.120
[Guest 1]: starts to defeating or achieving petty diplomatic victories, which really are of no consequence.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:44.080
[Guest 1]: And I put Masood Arz's listing in that particular category for probably domestic purposes. It

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.080
[Guest 1]: really makes no sense. The fact that we are investing that much foreign policy capital

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.840
[Guest 1]: in these things and diplomatic capital, which is terribly limited. I mean, India's diplomatic

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:56.600
[Guest 1]: core is very limited. The amount of money that we spent on our diplomacy is very limited

01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.320
[Guest 1]: compared to the Americans, the Chinese, the folks that you want to be compared with, you

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:05.680
[Guest 1]: know, the folks with whom you want to be playing this great game, are sort of 10-15 times more

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.920
[Guest 1]: spending more than you, their capacity is far greater than you. And you're wasting your

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:12.400
[Guest 1]: limited capacity on something as petty as this, which is not really going to get you

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:16.320
[Guest 1]: any significant tangible outcomes. That's where I think the problem lies. So as a security

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.400
[Guest 1]: policy, yes, you need to reorient your armed forces in a certain way, you need to make

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:23.400
[Guest 1]: sure that you have the capacity to deal with the threats that emerge. But from a foreign

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.760
[Guest 1]: policy perspective, you need to be looking at something far broader, of which say things

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:31.200
[Guest 1]: like Bangladesh, of which say things like, if you're worried about the Chinese having

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:36.040
[Guest 1]: greater influence in your neighborhood, what exactly are you doing about it? What sort

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.440
[Guest 1]: of connectivity project, if connectivity is what they're selling, and if you're saying

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.120
[Guest 1]: that your neighborhood is worried about an infrastructure deficit, and that's what they're

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:46.120
[Guest 1]: selling, you might not meet them dollar for dollar, but you have other advantages, you

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.520
[Guest 1]: can work with other partners, you've tried to. But again, at the end of the day, do you

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:53.240
[Guest 1]: have the capacity to deliver those projects? Maybe that's where your sort of policy should

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.920
[Guest 1]: be oriented towards, that what can we do to actually get some of these outcomes that we

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:02.000
[Guest 1]: need as opposed to focusing on this one lost cause, and making that the priority of a foreign

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
[Amit Varma]: policy.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.520
[Amit Varma]: And you know, people often, it almost feels natural to be so obsessed with Pakistan, because

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:11.480
[Amit Varma]: they were once, I mean, we were once one country, now they are our neighbor. However, Pranay,

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:16.800
[Amit Varma]: you have this concept of what you call multiple neighborhoods. And in many of the idea being

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:21.600
[Amit Varma]: that we inhabit many neighborhoods simultaneously, and in most of them, Pakistan is not a neighbor,

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.600
[Amit Varma]: they're a very distant nation. Kindly explain concept.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:30.400
[Guest 2]: Yeah, so my idea was when we use this word neighbor, we look at it from a geographic

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:35.520
[Guest 2]: lens, right. And in Indian foreign policy, also, the narrative is that India can't do

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:40.760
[Guest 2]: anything until and unless it has great relationships with all its neighbors and the geographic

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:45.600
[Guest 2]: name. I think that is quite unreasonable. No country in the world has good relationships

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:50.680
[Guest 2]: with all its neighbors, and only then it expands to other countries. Like, I mean, US and Mexico

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:57.000
[Guest 2]: also had problems and US and Cuba still have problems, right? So it's unreasonable to say

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:04.080
[Guest 2]: that. So my thinking was that geography is just one axis of looking at neighbors. In

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:09.400
[Guest 2]: fact, India has multiple neighbors. For example, technology wise, India now has neighbors in

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:15.960
[Guest 2]: China, in Europe, and US are India's technological neighbors. Then economic wise, the West Asia

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:22.040
[Guest 2]: is our neighbor for many things, even US again, for the services economy that we are, right.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:27.540
[Guest 2]: So the idea is that we should come out of this frame that we are, we can't do anything

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:33.200
[Guest 2]: until and unless we have great relationship with every South Asian country, right. So

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:38.240
[Guest 2]: let's look at beyond that we inhabit multiple neighborhoods, and each of these should be

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.720
[Guest 2]: looked differently. Sometimes, the government has also articulated this policy in terms

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:48.000
[Guest 2]: of extended neighborhood, but they again look at it geographically that India's close neighborhood

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000
[Guest 2]: is Indian subcontinent, beyond that there is a wider... So Iran would be an extended

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.680
[Guest 2]: neighbor. Yeah, level two neighbor. But I'm thinking just geography is just one axis,

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.700
[Amit Varma]: and geography is not necessarily the most important thing. I mean, geography is destiny

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:07.840
[Amit Varma]: only if we think it is destiny, in which case, yeah, it's a self fulfilling prophecy. Yeah,

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.920
[Guest 2]: so we need to look at all these neighborhoods, and how do we interact with each of them.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:17.800
[Guest 2]: And we can achieve more in one neighborhood without necessarily conquering or having great

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:22.080
[Guest 2]: relationship with everyone in another neighborhood. That was the idea.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:26.240
[Amit Varma]: So now my question is, and this will be a very newbie question for guys like you, so

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:32.120
[Amit Varma]: kindly forgive me, but I think many of my listeners will share my curiosity that what

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.720
[Amit Varma]: are the mechanics of foreign policy? Like when we talk about foreign policy, most people

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:40.040
[Amit Varma]: are thinking two external affairs ministers are sitting down with their teams over this,

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, nice, in this nice conference room, and there are flags in the background, and

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:47.680
[Amit Varma]: so on. So but what are the nuts and bolts? Like, what does it mean? You mentioned our

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:51.840
[Amit Varma]: foreign policy core, what is this core? How many you know, what is the training? Are they

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.400
[Amit Varma]: lifelong civil servants? Or are they generalists who are brought in from other departments?

01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:00.000
[Amit Varma]: And if I mean, I know there's something called the Indian Foreign Services, for example.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.080
[Amit Varma]: So how does it and does that have a culture and a thinking and an ideology of its own?

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.160
[Amit Varma]: How does it evolve? And, you know, when what's going on right now, between India and China,

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.400
[Amit Varma]: we know there's no top level meeting happening right now. But what is happening? You know,

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.080
[Amit Varma]: other governments communicating on a daily basis? What are the sort of movements that

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:22.880
[Guest 2]: happen? Yeah, so I would say there are various economic diplomacy, there is public diplomacy,

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:28.840
[Amit Varma]: so there are various levels of like, who carries this out? Like economic diplomacy? Is it the

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:34.160
[Amit Varma]: finance ministry and the foreign ministry collaborating or? Yeah, so there is that's

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:39.800
[Guest 2]: a good question. See, economic diplomacy is a mix of union governments and a bit of state

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:44.760
[Guest 2]: governments also having a role. For example, remember when Narendra Modi was the CM of

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.880
[Guest 2]: Gujarat? Vibrant Gujarat. Yeah. And there was a lot of things with China and trying

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.680
[Guest 2]: to establish investments from China. So if you look at economic diplomacy, per se, you

01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:00.440
[Guest 2]: have, it's largely the instrument of this is still the IFS. So people who are trained,

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:06.000
[Guest 2]: they are diplomats also do the role of on the economic front. But politically, now even

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.640
[Guest 2]: states are getting involved. So what they do is every state, almost every state in India

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:17.040
[Guest 2]: has this investor summit, one gala event every year where they'll call people from across

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:24.400
[Guest 2]: worlds, the companies to come and invest here. Even the CMs go across to many countries now,

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:30.920
[Guest 2]: I remember 2016, the Madhya Pradesh CM was in Washington DC for a day and saying, you

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:36.960
[Guest 2]: know, come and invest in Madhya Pradesh. So that happens. But largely the bureaucratic

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:43.520
[Guest 2]: instrument which carries out economic diplomacy is still the IFS. I have an idea on that,

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:49.360
[Guest 2]: that we should actually, states should be able to have direct relationships on the economic

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:55.120
[Guest 2]: front and they should be able to bypass IFS. Maybe they can fund a chair in the embassy

01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:02.400
[Guest 2]: in Washington DC, which is funded by say Karnataka or Maharashtra. And they pursue their own independent

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.920
[Guest 2]: economic diplomacy for their own state. It happens in other countries. So for example,

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:12.280
[Guest 2]: Australia, we are in Bangalore and there are, there's Victoria, there are other states of

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:17.800
[Guest 2]: Australia which have a presence here apart from the presence of the Australian government,

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.240
[Guest 2]: federal government. So that happens. That is what I would like to see, but currently

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.840
[Guest 1]: it is, the instrument is still IFS. I mean, I look at it a little bit. So let's just go

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.880
[Guest 1]: from the point of view of who's in China right now. We've got embassies, we've got missions

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:35.360
[Guest 1]: established over there. So you've got the ambassador, you've got counselor officers,

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.560
[Guest 1]: you've got people dealing with different portfolios in that embassy. So that's your first point

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:42.840
[Guest 1]: of contact in that country. And that's the same thing with any other country. That's

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.760
[Guest 1]: essentially your IFS core, which is doing what it's doing. The IFS core, if I'm, I could

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:51.280
[Guest 1]: be wrong here, but my numbers from what I recall is about 1200 to 1500 people, which

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.280
[Guest 1]: is for a country of this size is quite small. In comparison, if I recall China's correctly

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.480
[Guest 1]: was about seven and a half, 8,000 or 10,000, around about that. It might've changed in

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.960
[Guest 1]: a couple of years. And for the US it's around 15,000. And these are rough sort of numbers

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.080
[Guest 1]: that I recall reading a couple of years ago. So you can see that capacity wise, there's

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.440
[Guest 1]: this massive difference. There's also the amount of money that you're spending. The

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:12.960
[Guest 1]: Chinese sort of raised double the amount that they were spending. And again, it's very difficult

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.920
[Guest 1]: to calculate total spends because how do you estimate it? Is it salaries? Is it what you're

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.440
[Guest 1]: spending on events? Is it what you're spending on embassies? Or is it also certain other

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.360
[Guest 1]: events that you're doing? Because diplomacy is not just about what the foreign ministry

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.040
[Guest 1]: bureaucrats are doing. It's also about necessarily say, when NITI Aayog meets with the National

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:33.320
[Guest 1]: Development Reform Commission over there, and they have a conversation about how do

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.280
[Guest 1]: you facilitate investment, cross-border investment on both sides. That's part of your economic

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.160
[Guest 1]: diplomacy and it doesn't necessarily have IFS guys involved. They may be working through

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.160
[Guest 1]: the IFS in some way or the other, because you need to get people in and you need to

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:47.760
[Guest 1]: actually get some degree of harmony between different institutions. But it's these guys

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.960
[Guest 1]: who are actually pursuing an agenda. Likewise, when say health ministries talk or when you

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:56.520
[Guest 1]: sort of establish a dialogue on health on certain things, when you're talking on climate,

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:59.640
[Guest 1]: it might not necessarily be the IFS guys who are taking the lead. It might be different

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:04.160
[Guest 1]: institutions who are doing it, but the IFS will be involved. When you're talking on visas

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:08.320
[Guest 1]: and student exchanges, while your education ministry in India might be involved, also

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:11.520
[Guest 1]: your home ministry might be involved because the home ministry might be worried about certain

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.280
[Guest 1]: people coming in from the point of view of espionage or those sorts of things, and they

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.920
[Guest 1]: might want to block certain things. So it's multiple institutions that will be involved,

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:23.960
[Guest 1]: driven predominantly by, well in this administration, driven predominantly by the PMO and sort of

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.720
[Guest 1]: executed by the Foreign Service, by the MEA. But there are multiple institutions at multiple

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:32.920
[Guest 1]: layers this is happening, of which one sort of other layer, distinct layer is para-diplomacy

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.280
[Guest 1]: which Pranay was talking about, which is where states do certain things. That is something

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:40.360
[Guest 1]: that we actually argue for, like Pranay said that, you know, if it might be too radical

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.320
[Guest 1]: for an Indian government to sort of say that, well, states can establish their own missions,

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.720
[Guest 1]: but at least states should be doing much more because often, say in relationships like India

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:55.200
[Guest 1]: and China, where you end up in a situation that even sort of the smallest steps that

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.840
[Guest 1]: you take forward can get pushed back and our industry might end up saying that, well, we

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.400
[Guest 1]: don't necessarily want to get Chinese money here, or we don't necessarily want to cut

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:07.200
[Guest 1]: these deals because the next thing you know, there's tension between Delhi and Beijing

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.240
[Guest 1]: over the border and our business goes for a toss. Those sorts of things happen because

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:15.040
[Guest 1]: you're dealing through the centre. Once you start dealing independently, there's a lesser

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.520
[Guest 1]: chance of that happening, particularly if you're going through your state governments

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.680
[Guest 1]: and all of that. You might still have those fears, but you might get certain assurances

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:24.280
[Guest 1]: from a state government saying, look, behind you, you can do this. So I think somewhere

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.800
[Guest 1]: the states need to take a greater role in that and that sort of para-diplomacy needs

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:31.320
[Guest 1]: to happen. People-to-people engagement, again, it's states that need to play a role. The

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.760
[Guest 1]: central government can say, yes, we're going to facilitate visas, but it's actually the

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:38.680
[Guest 1]: state government that probably might decide that, you know what, this is a destination

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.080
[Guest 1]: which might be really interesting for Chinese visitors because there's a history for China

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.280
[Guest 1]: or for American visitors because there's a history here and let's tailor the experience

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:50.160
[Guest 1]: to attract this kind of visitor. And you do that. I mean, the West does that, right? When

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:54.600
[Guest 1]: you go to London today and you go for a holiday, stores like Harrods have special Chinese signage

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:57.960
[Guest 1]: and all of that. And you're doing that because you see that there's a revenue stream and

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.000
[Guest 1]: there's a store doing it, but a city can also do it. A city can put up, a city can create

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.600
[Guest 1]: an app which makes, which ensures that if a tourist from, say, a heavy spending country,

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.680
[Guest 1]: let's assume Japan, is coming to India, they can access information in Japanese if they

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:15.160
[Guest 1]: can't access it in English. So those are the things, executions the states have to do,

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.880
[Guest 1]: and that's where they can become part of this broader thing. But yeah, so that's how I would

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:22.480
[Guest 1]: classify the sort of machinations of foreign policy as a whole. At any given point of time,

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:26.320
[Guest 1]: there are multiple things happening. The armed forces play a role in it. There are delegations

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:30.200
[Guest 1]: coming back and forth, which have foreign policy implications. And this is a continuous

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:34.560
[Guest 1]: process. So this sort of engagement is continuous and it should be continuous. Because if you

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:37.840
[Guest 1]: keep snapping this over a period of time, you don't end up building the institutional

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.640
[Guest 1]: memory of how do you deal with crisis when they occur.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:45.240
[Guest 2]: And we are talking about diplomacy, but foreign policy will include other things as well.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:50.560
[Guest 2]: Like there will be intelligence, which happens, then there will be even defense policy, right?

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:55.360
[Guest 2]: So there will be military attaches, for example, who will be stationed at important missions

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:59.480
[Guest 2]: abroad. They look at the military side of things. So if we talk about foreign policy,

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:04.760
[Guest 2]: it includes these elements as well. But we were narrowly talking about just the diplomatic

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.760
[Amit Varma]: instrument.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.720
[Amit Varma]: So now in domestic politics, just as it seems that the state often takes credit for something

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:15.160
[Amit Varma]: that society has achieved, right? Which is very typical in India and which often society

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:19.280
[Amit Varma]: has achieved in spite of the state. It strikes me that in foreign policy, nations are often

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:23.880
[Amit Varma]: negotiating over things which are actually people to people things. For example, a one

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:28.200
[Amit Varma]: big political issue often is a trade deficit. And people behave as if one country is trading

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:32.160
[Amit Varma]: directly with another country. But the truth is people from both countries are trading

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:37.080
[Amit Varma]: with each other to mutual benefit. And you'd imagine therefore that the job of the country,

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.480
[Amit Varma]: the job of the state is to enable those transactions.

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:45.760
[Amit Varma]: So now, let's take a scenario where I'm doing this to come to a question about conflicting

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:50.880
[Amit Varma]: interests within arms of the state. That where, for example, I am from the foreign office

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:56.040
[Amit Varma]: and I feel that it's great if China invests more, and if more of their goods come. But

01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:01.600
[Amit Varma]: let's say Manoj is from the Home Department, and he has political pressure because lobbies

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:06.920
[Amit Varma]: of local manufacturers are saying no put heavy tariffs, because otherwise, it is hurting

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.640
[Amit Varma]: us. And of course, economically sound thing to do is to not have any tariffs at all. But

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:15.220
[Amit Varma]: there are these political pressures. So are there these kind of internal, like from within

01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:20.560
[Amit Varma]: the government, pulls and pressures that the foreign office has to deal with?

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:26.120
[Guest 2]: Obviously that exists. And an example of that is the Huawei issue, which is currently going

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:31.920
[Guest 2]: on. So should Huawei be involved in India's 5G critical infrastructure? Now, there are

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:37.560
[Guest 2]: various views on it. One clear view is the economic view that India might be losing out

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:43.160
[Guest 2]: on a lot of things because Huawei is clearly the front runner. It overestimates its ability

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:47.280
[Guest 2]: because Samsung and all are also catching up. But nevertheless, there will be some economic

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.840
[Guest 2]: loss to it. On the other hand, there is the security first approach, which says that,

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:58.520
[Guest 2]: you know, you shouldn't involve China because they might snoop into your infrastructure.

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:03.840
[Guest 2]: Then the third one is a strategic view, right? That what it does it augur well for India

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:11.200
[Guest 2]: to give away, hand over its critical infrastructure to an adversarial state, which is more powerful

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:16.800
[Guest 2]: than us than currently, right? So these are all conflicting views. So foreign policy always

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:22.560
[Guest 2]: has to grapple with this. On this particular issue, for example, again, using the multiple

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:29.040
[Guest 2]: tents and not one camp approach, the way we have articulated it is that for phones, etc,

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:34.120
[Guest 2]: which give a tremendous amount of consumer surplus to an individual Indian, we should

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:39.120
[Guest 2]: allow Huawei or any Chinese phone. But when it comes to the critical network infrastructure,

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:43.040
[Guest 2]: we should avoid Chinese investment there. What do you say?

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.400
[Guest 1]: Yeah, no, that's the argument that we've made. And I agree with that argument. I think the

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:49.440
[Guest 1]: other sort of example, while you were sort of framing the question, the thought kept

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:53.640
[Guest 1]: into my mind, the thought that kept coming to me was, you were talking about RCEP and

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:57.920
[Guest 1]: India pulling out of RCEP. It was exactly that, right? It was the fact that you were

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:02.240
[Guest 1]: negotiating for so many years, and you were positive despite sort of domestic push and

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.680
[Guest 1]: pull from multiple lobbies within India. And even sort of this government sort of Swadeshi

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:12.240
[Guest 1]: branch, which wanted us to pull out of this deal, yet we were negotiating the fact that

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:15.360
[Guest 1]: the Prime Minister went there, obviously, he didn't go there with the idea that I'm

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:19.160
[Guest 1]: going to go there and say thanks, but no thanks. He went there with the idea of signing up.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:23.000
[Guest 1]: Yet there were pressures that forced him to pull out, which predominantly were domestic

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000
[Guest 1]: sort of economic pressures, which told him that his lobbies would probably not be working

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.240
[Guest 1]: in his favor. If he ends up signing this deal, it'll hurt him politically.

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:34.280
[Amit Varma]: No, it's really ironic and really sad that the one time the Prime Minister listened to

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.320
[Amit Varma]: pressure from the opposition, it was to do the wrong thing. I mean, our pulling out of

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.800
[Amit Varma]: RCEP, frankly, was just so stupid and counterproductive, according to me.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:45.720
[Amit Varma]: I don't think he listened to the opposition. I think they also believe in this.

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:46.720
[Amit Varma]: No, but I think he...

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:47.720
[Amit Varma]: The Swadeshi wing and all of that.

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.840
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I think he listened to that sort of part, because otherwise, it made no sense

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.800
[Guest 1]: to go there. The fact that you went there, you thought that you had a deal and you would

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.920
[Guest 1]: want to actually end up doing a deal. But yeah, that's exactly an example of how these

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.760
[Amit Varma]: things play out and...

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.160
[Guest 1]: One good thing the man was about to do.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:04.280
[Guest 1]: That could have been one of those transformative things in foreign policy.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.880
[Guest 2]: Yeah, actually, Amit, I don't think foreign policy is any different. It's actually just

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:14.760
[Guest 2]: between concentrated interest versus dispersed interest, right? The benefits are they concentrated

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:20.760
[Guest 2]: or they are dispersed. So, for example, if there is a foreign policy which allows investments

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:25.120
[Guest 2]: from all countries, it will benefit a large number of people in a dispersed manner, but

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:29.480
[Guest 2]: it will affect a few Indian incumbent players in a concentrated manner.

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:33.640
[Amit Varma]: So, concentrated costs, and therefore, they will lobby in all of that.

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:39.200
[Guest 2]: Which exists in other areas also. So, it's quite similar to that. And on trade deficit,

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:44.600
[Guest 2]: for example, we've always argued, right? It is about trade deficit by itself is not a

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:45.600
[Amit Varma]: bad thing at all.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:50.200
[Amit Varma]: Exactly. I mean, I have a trade deficit with my domestic help, for example. I pay her every

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.960
[Guest 2]: month, I buy her services, she doesn't buy anything from me. And it's a positive sum

01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:54.960
[Guest 2]: game.

01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:01.000
[Guest 2]: Yeah. So, and it indicates comparative advantage. So, if China's investment into India, we have

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.240
[Guest 2]: manufactured products come from China to India, it indicates that they are good at it. But

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:10.160
[Guest 2]: we can have some other trade, we can use that investment to grow our own companies. And

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:14.960
[Guest 2]: then our companies, we can again invest back in China, right? So, it is about...

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:18.480
[Amit Varma]: And a part of me, the libertarian part of me is also rebelling to the way you're saying

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:23.520
[Amit Varma]: our and we and because these are all dispersed individuals and dispersed companies who are

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:29.000
[Amit Varma]: all trading to sort of mutual benefit. We've spoken a lot about how sort of India looks

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.160
[Amit Varma]: at the world. Let's talk about how the world looks at India. For example, let's start with

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:38.760
[Amit Varma]: the US. I mean, let's go major power by major power. Let's start at the US that, you know,

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:43.240
[Amit Varma]: initially through the Cold War, we must have been an extremely pesky presence for them,

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:47.280
[Amit Varma]: though, you know, they've blown hot and cold. I had a fascinating episode with Srinath Raghavan

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:52.200
[Amit Varma]: on US foreign policy in South Asia over the decades. But how has that changed in recent

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:56.160
[Amit Varma]: years? And secondly, can it change in recent years? Like, can we talk of something called

01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:01.160
[Amit Varma]: a coherent foreign policy where so much of what they do is to the whims and fancies and

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:06.680
[Guest 2]: Twitter moods of their president at 3am? Yeah, again, so for example, we can't look at us

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:12.920
[Guest 2]: as a rational actor only because then there are these big variances which are happening

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:20.000
[Guest 2]: now. But if I had to make that simplification, I think broadly, US, as I said earlier, the

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.960
[Guest 2]: transition has been one they see India at a different level than a regional player and

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:31.640
[Guest 2]: a different from Pakistan. And secondly, they see India as a potential balancing power against

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:37.240
[Guest 2]: China. That's why they are so interested in doing lots of things, a quad and others where

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:44.160
[Guest 2]: India becomes an important role. So largely, the trend has been positive. US requires India

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:49.840
[Guest 2]: as well for its own interests. So that's where our interests overlap. Yeah, and also possible

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:54.280
[Guest 1]: market for many more things, not just goods, but also things like education. I mean, high

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:58.280
[Guest 1]: time when we open up our education sector to foreign institutes and universities, and the

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.800
[Guest 1]: attraction of Western institutes is obviously going to be primary. So there's lots of places

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:05.440
[Guest 1]: where lots of untapped potential that you can sort of nurture and eventually sort of

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.840
[Guest 1]: get to hopefully, and to me as the rest of it, I agree with Pranay that yeah, that's

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:14.120
[Guest 2]: how the US looks at us. So you have strength in numbers, right? Anything that comes into

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:20.520
[Guest 2]: India or China, you always have a huge market. So a lot of countries, companies which are

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:24.840
[Guest 2]: in different nation states are looking at it. So they are trying to push the foreign

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:29.960
[Guest 2]: policy of their nation state in favor of the other nation states, right? And also, there's

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:34.400
[Amit Varma]: been a lot happening in recent years. So there are all these pulls and pressures in the relationship

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:39.440
[Amit Varma]: with the Middle East, obviously, with North Korea, and the recent sort of tensions with

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Iran, and all of that. Does India just kind of take a step back and say, keys, none of

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:47.680
[Amit Varma]: our business, let them play out? Or are there opportunities for us? And are there threats

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:51.160
[Amit Varma]: for us in all of this potential turmoil that may happen?

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:57.600
[Guest 2]: There are definitely opportunities and threats there. And we can't afford to have a completely

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:02.740
[Guest 2]: isolationist position, because now the global economy is also intertwined. Just anything

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:05.120
[Amit Varma]: which happens on Iran is going to affect our...

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.520
[Amit Varma]: And as you pointed out, some of them are in our neighborhood, depending on how we define

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.520
[Guest 2]: it.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:16.040
[Guest 2]: Exactly. So that is an important factor. So, but what realistically India can do depends

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:22.320
[Guest 2]: on India's own capabilities, right? And that needs to come from gaining more strength economically

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:29.160
[Guest 2]: and militarily, for which we need to grow. So we might want to do great things, but to

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:33.800
[Guest 2]: achieve them in reality, we need to build strength. So if we have to look at it from

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:38.180
[Guest 2]: the same strength, okay, something US does with Iran, now we will do a marginal cost

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:45.820
[Guest 2]: marginal benefit approach, right? Should we intervene in that in some way or not? Now,

01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:51.720
[Guest 2]: the marginal benefit of intervening currently for the marginal cost will be high because

01:24:51.720 --> 01:25:00.200
[Guest 2]: we, US is closely tied with the Indian economy in Iran, not so much apart from oil. So realistically,

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:05.080
[Guest 2]: if we can, if we want to change that marginal benefit cost calculation, we have to build

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:06.080
[Guest 1]: our own strength.

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:09.120
[Guest 1]: Yeah, that is going to be fundamental to everything. Like, I mean, the current foreign ministers

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:13.500
[Guest 1]: use this phrase, right? That India will be a leading power, we will no longer abstain

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:18.920
[Guest 1]: from things and we will actually take decisions. That's wonderful. But would you have the capacity

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:21.880
[Guest 1]: to sustain the backlash from some of these decisions? Would you have the capacity to

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.800
[Guest 1]: back those decisions up as needed? Those are the kind of things I mean, so far, it's in

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.480
[Guest 1]: the region like the Middle East, the fact that India has done somewhat similar to what

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:32.920
[Guest 1]: the Chinese have done is, we want to have a good relationship with everybody. We don't

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.600
[Guest 1]: necessarily want to rock the boat with anybody because fundamentally, our energy resources

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:42.160
[Guest 1]: come from here. And we don't have the capacity like the US to, you know, twist and turn your

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:47.560
[Guest 1]: arms to get you to agree to our demands. So we want to have a good relationship with everybody.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:50.640
[Guest 1]: And while we sort of stick to certain principle positions, so while through the time through

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:55.120
[Guest 1]: the 90s, we were sort of pro the Palestinian cause, we also developed a very deep relationship

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:59.040
[Guest 1]: with Israel. And those are the kind of things that have benefited us in the long run. Pivoting

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.680
[Guest 1]: away from some of these things might create new complications, at least till you don't

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:06.280
[Guest 1]: have the capacity to pivot away. And you know, deal with the consequences that will come

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:09.680
[Guest 1]: with it. One of the examples in the Middle East, if I was to continue that example, our

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:14.160
[Guest 1]: greatest dependency is energy. Variations in prices hit our economy badly. What are

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:17.320
[Guest 1]: the sort of alternative methods that we're doing? One of the ideas that we've discussed

01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:20.760
[Guest 1]: in the office is a strategic reserve and where our strategic reserve are. We've been studying

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:24.200
[Guest 1]: that and what we realized is based on studying is that actually, we've done reasonably well

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:28.480
[Guest 1]: on that. So now when you've done that, you've created for yourself the room to be able to

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.560
[Guest 1]: do some of these other things that you might want to. Shift your positions, pivot and deal

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:35.520
[Guest 1]: with the pressure that might come with somebody saying, well, okay, fine, these are the prices

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:39.440
[Guest 1]: of oil or artificially if I'm going to reduce output and that's going to affect you. So

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.360
[Guest 1]: if we do some of these things, then yes, you can make those decisions, which may seem difficult.

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.720
[Guest 1]: But till you're not doing that, you're not going to be making those decisions. And that's

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:48.400
[Guest 1]: where the capacity argument comes in.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.920
[Amit Varma]: Let's move now to China, on which of course you and I did an episode a few months ago,

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:57.280
[Amit Varma]: Manoj. With China, I have a dual question, which is one, of course, how does it look

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:02.400
[Amit Varma]: at India and how that has changed? But two, also China was famously very insular for a

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:05.480
[Amit Varma]: long time where they looked within, you know, they were the middle kingdom and they were

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:10.480
[Amit Varma]: quite happy to kind of ignore everything outside their peripheries. And has that been changing?

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:14.720
[Amit Varma]: Are they more aggressive? Are they more into projecting power? And how has their dynamic

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:19.280
[Amit Varma]: with the US changed? Partly because of situations outside their control, of course, but how

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:23.760
[Amit Varma]: are things evolving? And how does all of that affect India? Which is like 20 questions.

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:24.760
[Guest 1]: I'm so sorry.

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:28.880
[Guest 1]: So, no, just a quick sweep. The Chinese were insular for a very small period of time, which

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:33.240
[Guest 1]: was about 10-12 years when the cultural revolution happened. And they had after the internal

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:36.200
[Guest 1]: turmoil till 78, which is when they entered reform and opening up.

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.200
[Guest 1]: But even historically, all those kingdoms and the powers.

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:42.080
[Guest 1]: So, not necessarily. I mean, there was a point of time where the Ming dynasty was outward

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:45.600
[Guest 1]: looking. It was actually venturing into many places. I mean, if you look at, this is a

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.960
[Guest 1]: good exercise to do. So anybody sitting at home, just go and download all the maps of

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:52.400
[Guest 1]: Chinese dynasties and then superimpose them over each other, creating a time lapse. And

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.680
[Guest 1]: you will actually see that the ancient state has expanded quite significantly with each

01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:56.680
[Amit Varma]: dynasty.

01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:59.280
[Amit Varma]: I would like to see some listener do this, please. A great image on Twitter.

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:03.240
[Guest 1]: So it will be this, you'll see that the state has expanded quite significantly over a period

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:07.080
[Guest 1]: of time. And there have been, and if you then look at sort of just beyond what is the current

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:11.760
[Guest 1]: Chinese state territory, you'll see that they also ventured in many places under with Zheng

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:12.760
[Guest 1]: He.

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.480
[Guest 1]: Then there came a point where they looked inward. And this looking inward had to do

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:19.720
[Guest 1]: partly with their own sense of we are self-contained, but also the sense of, you know, subsequently

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:23.160
[Guest 1]: as sort of the industrial revolution hits, the fact that we are sort of losing out and

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.880
[Guest 1]: therefore we are looking inward even more.

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.440
[Guest 1]: This happened during the Qing dynasty.

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.720
[Guest 1]: Now fast forward to Mao Zedong, what Mao Zedong did was initially he was an outward looking

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:34.600
[Guest 1]: fellow. He didn't have the capacity, just like India didn't have the capacity to actually

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:39.240
[Guest 1]: influence events, but he realized that he could do it asymmetrically. So while he invested

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:42.880
[Guest 1]: in building the bomb and doing all of those things, he also trained revolutionaries from

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:43.880
[Guest 1]: around the world.

01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:47.760
[Guest 1]: So in India, there were revolutionaries that were sort of trained over there in Africa,

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:51.140
[Guest 1]: in East Asia, in the Middle East, there were lots of revolutionaries that were trained.

01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:54.560
[Unknown]: And the idea was to export this model. So you were outward looking in that sense. You

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:58.880
[Guest 1]: might not necessarily be looking at expanding territory of the Chinese state, but at least

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:01.200
[Guest 1]: the influence through revolution was a case.

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.520
[Guest 1]: Then came the cultural revolution, which became, where it became insular, because you were

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:09.120
[Guest 1]: just sowing chaos within for the sake of some churn of revolution that he thought he would

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.120
[Guest 1]: achieve.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:13.440
[Guest 1]: And then subsequently in 78, you start seeing this shift of policy where you open up to

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:18.120
[Guest 1]: the broader world, attract foreign investment, work with international organizations, work

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:21.800
[Guest 1]: with foreign experts to sort of reform your economy. Deng Xiaoping travels to the US,

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:26.760
[Guest 1]: wears that cowboy hat and everything becomes hunky dory. But the objective there was, we

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:30.680
[Guest 1]: still don't have the capacity to maybe influence things on a certain scale.

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:34.440
[Guest 1]: So we define what are our core interests, what we can't necessarily give, but within

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:38.640
[Guest 1]: that we have a lot of pragmatism of room to cooperate. And that's when Deng Xiaoping comes

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.560
[Guest 1]: up with these frameworks, right? Oh, we can talk about these disputes later, let's first

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:46.000
[Guest 1]: get rich. And he tells that to other countries also, let's first get rich, we can do all

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
[Guest 1]: this stuff later.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.600
[Guest 1]: Fast forward to today, the Chinese come to a point after 2008, when the financial crisis

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:57.480
[Guest 1]: hits where they feel that we've gotten fairly rich. And from 2008 onwards, still growth

01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:01.400
[Guest 1]: in China is quite significant. And by the time Xi Jinping is coming to power, they've

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:05.520
[Guest 1]: already sort of remoulding their policy towards saying that, I think we've gotten to a point

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:09.040
[Guest 1]: where we can actually sort of start pushing forward. And we probably also need to push

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:14.040
[Guest 1]: on certain things, because internally, our economic growth will start to slow down significantly

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.920
[Guest 1]: and until we start to push outward.

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:19.200
[Guest 1]: So they want to sort of aggressively push investments outside because you've got so

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:23.160
[Guest 1]: much foreign reserve, which is not yielding enough return in treasury bonds, and so on

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:26.360
[Guest 1]: and so forth, that you want to sort of create more revenue also. So there are multiple factors

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:30.840
[Guest 1]: which lead to this push outside. And that's where they are today, where they feel that

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:36.240
[Guest 1]: formally the sort of ideology shifts from hiding and biding your time to let's actively

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:40.200
[Guest 1]: change things to be able to get our objectives. And that's what they're doing right now. It's

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:44.280
[Guest 1]: again, in some ways, just the fact that I think, I think Pranay will talk about this

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:48.880
[Guest 1]: just as Edward Luttwak in his book had this wonderful analogy of China being this giant

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:52.680
[Guest 1]: elephant in an elevator. And just by the fact that it's an elephant in an elevator, it's

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:56.120
[Guest 1]: squeezing other people. And it's growing larger and the larger it's growing, the more it's

01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.760
[Guest 1]: squeezing people. So even if it doesn't have aggressive intent, it's creating problems

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:04.280
[Guest 1]: for others. And that's what's sort of happening with the Chinese. In terms of how they look

01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:09.000
[Guest 1]: at India, if you read what they say, I mean, don't go by the great informal symmetry that

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.640
[Guest 1]: we're doing and the wonderful pictures, just read their classification of powers. They

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:17.280
[Guest 1]: have a classification of major powers in which they see the Russia, the US and the European

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:22.080
[Guest 1]: Union. And then they have a classification of peripheral powers. India falls within peripheral

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:26.720
[Guest 1]: power. It's a little bit notch above the sort of Vietnam, Philippines, of course, but it's

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:30.840
[Guest 1]: still a peripheral power, which it sees within the context of this sort of Indian Ocean,

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:35.280
[Guest 1]: South Asian region. They don't necessarily see them as a, see India as a major power.

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:39.880
[Guest 1]: And that's why the sense is that this can be a pesky irritant, like you defined, described

01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:44.200
[Guest 1]: India in the 50s for the US. This can be an irritant in sort of our pathway. It can also

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:48.080
[Guest 1]: be a troublemaker because it has the capacity to deliver a certain kind of pain, particularly

01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:53.360
[Guest 1]: if you enter into conflict. Yet, by and large, status quo won't necessarily be looking to

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:59.000
[Guest 1]: move and alter status quo. Inefficient, unable to necessarily deliver large scale projects,

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.920
[Guest 1]: which creates a credibility crisis in other countries and therefore creates opportunities

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:08.360
[Guest 1]: for us. So, it is a threat in some ways, particularly as China sort of expands into the Indian Ocean

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:12.440
[Guest 1]: region, but largely a threat that they feel they can contain. And that's what we've seen

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:16.320
[Guest 1]: them try to do. At any point of time with China's relationship with the US tends to

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:20.840
[Guest 1]: become difficult. You've seen them reach out to the neighbours and try to sort of smoothen

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:25.880
[Guest 1]: tensions along the periphery. And that's what's happened in the last couple of years. As you,

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:30.480
[Guest 1]: as and when and if, although it's highly unlikely they enter into some sort of a modus vivendi

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:34.160
[Guest 1]: with the US, with this current tension with the US, you'll probably start seeing greater

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.960
[Guest 1]: pressure. You'll probably start seeing greater pressure on India, on Japan and these countries.

01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:42.080
[Guest 1]: What kind of pressure? So, you'll probably start seeing greater pushback on Indian criticism.

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:45.160
[Guest 1]: You'd probably start seeing greater money being invested in South Asia. You'd probably

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.440
[Guest 1]: start seeing greater arguments against this idea that, you know, we want India to be part

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.000
[Guest 1]: of this broader BRI or whatever. Well, if you don't want to be part of it, don't be

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.800
[Guest 1]: part of it. We don't necessarily need to work with you. The market will remain an allure.

01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:59.760
[Guest 1]: So, if you can have an India which is favourable to you, great. If you can have an India which

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:04.360
[Guest 1]: is non-aligned in this conflict with the US, acceptable. But if you can actually enter

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:09.520
[Guest 1]: into some sort of a deal with the US or some sort of a G2 arrangement, then India becomes

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:13.720
[Guest 1]: far less significant in some ways. Because then you are looking at, and then actually

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:17.240
[Guest 1]: for you might become much more significant to India. Because India might say, well, okay,

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:20.040
[Guest 1]: now we need to work with them more. So, you will see the Chinese pushing their weight

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:24.200
[Guest 1]: around a little bit more than what they do normally. So, those are the kind of things

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:28.920
[Guest 2]: that I think we can see going forward. Yeah. Again, if you see, right, because US sees

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:34.840
[Guest 2]: China as a challenger, and now China is also aspiring to be the US. When you talk about

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:38.840
[Guest 2]: India-China relationship, again, US becomes an important determinant. So, again, if I

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:43.720
[Guest 2]: have to draw really broadly a few schools of thought from China over the last few years,

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:49.880
[Guest 2]: they would be one school of thought sees India as doing US's bidding on a lot of things.

01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:54.320
[Guest 2]: That is one extremist school of thought. The other school of thought, which was there probably

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:59.520
[Guest 2]: 10 years ago, it had some narrative dominance, was India as a competitor to some of the things

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:04.960
[Guest 2]: China is doing. Now, not so much, but that was one. The other, the third narrative is

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:11.240
[Guest 2]: India is insignificant. That also was a narrative, which is no longer the dominant one at any

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:16.120
[Guest 2]: point of time, but it exists. And the fourth one is India as a competitor, right? Competition

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:21.240
[Guest 2]: in some areas and probably areas of cooperation in others. So, I think these are like broad

01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:27.520
[Guest 2]: four schools of thought. The two that are dominant now, I would say is one, sometimes

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:32.120
[Guest 2]: they see India as doing US's bidding. And the other one is, no, but there are areas

01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:37.160
[Guest 2]: of cooperation that we can explore. What do you think? Yeah, no, I think the primary concern

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:41.760
[Guest 1]: from them from an Indian perspective is that they see India as a potential spoiler in terms

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:45.600
[Guest 1]: of its alignment with the US. And therefore, I said, an India which is aligned to the US

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:50.560
[Guest 1]: is problematic. An India which is favorable to China, great. An India which is non-aligned

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:55.320
[Guest 1]: in this contest with the US is acceptable. But an India which sort of tilts towards the

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:59.720
[Guest 1]: US in more ways than one is problematic. I mean, every time you read the Chinese talking

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:04.640
[Guest 1]: about anything that India does, it's through this prism of the US. To me, that tells you

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.560
[Guest 1]: two things. One, that their competition with the US is what's defining this. And the other,

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:14.760
[Guest 1]: that this idea of India as a cooperative partner in certain areas is also limited to the prism

01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:18.720
[Guest 1]: of not necessarily strategic domains. Because you'll see the fact that you're worried about

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:22.160
[Guest 1]: certain this party aligning with your primary adversary, you know that you're not going

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:25.960
[Guest 1]: to be cooperating with them on strategic domains. But what you also know is that this party

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:30.400
[Guest 1]: is not necessarily as significant in the larger scheme of things if I can reach a deal with

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:36.280
[Guest 1]: the Americans. Then the potential of an India to play a spoiler in my eyes is far smaller.

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:39.800
[Guest 1]: Because it doesn't necessarily have the kind of backing that it has. Unless it's obviously

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:45.200
[Guest 1]: growing significantly at those 8, 9, 10% over the next 10 years while this competition with

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:49.480
[Guest 1]: the US continues to play out. And then you're at a point where India is significantly stronger.

01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:53.260
[Guest 1]: So then even if you've sort of got some sort of a deal with the US, this is a significant

01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:56.680
[Guest 1]: problem irrespective of that. At the moment, I don't think that's the case.

01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:01.040
[Amit Varma]: And a final question about China before we move on, which is that the long standing disputes

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:05.200
[Amit Varma]: they have with us into including the border disputes, are they just strategic levers which

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:10.040
[Amit Varma]: you use as and when you want to manipulate your way to some kind of a, you know, change

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:14.800
[Amit Varma]: the equilibrium? Or can any of them actually escalate and explode into conflict?

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.160
[Guest 1]: Look, I think there is a probability is very, very low. But there is a possibility that

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:22.920
[Guest 1]: you can end up having conflict. To me, if you look at China's history, when it comes

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:27.880
[Guest 1]: to dealing with territorial disputes, it had about 14, 11, 12, 11 to 14 grand border disputes

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:30.920
[Guest 1]: and it settled most of them. The only ones that are remaining are with Bhutan and India.

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:34.400
[Guest 1]: And the one with Bhutan is also remaining because India is a party to all of it. I mean,

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:37.040
[Guest 1]: given the asymmetry between Bhutan and China, the Chinese would have settled it one way

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:41.560
[Guest 1]: or the other. I think the border dispute with India persists for a number of reasons. It's

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:47.040
[Guest 1]: partly sort of strategically, because you wanted to push that aside and say, let's work

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:50.720
[Guest 1]: together on certain things, which is what Rajiv Gandhi and Deng Xiaoping agreed to.

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:53.880
[Guest 1]: And you thought, okay, let's just go about confidence building and we'll do this. From

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:58.000
[Guest 1]: a Chinese point of view, was there any value in settling this dispute and giving away what

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.760
[Guest 1]: became important territory, particularly Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh, which was sort of became

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:06.440
[Guest 1]: in some way linked to identity of their control over Tibet and those sorts of things. The

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:10.980
[Guest 1]: other bit was the fact that till the Dalai Lama saw that as a problem, the Dalai Lama's

01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:14.600
[Guest 1]: influence in Tibet as a problem, you could not necessarily resolve it because you saw

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:19.040
[Guest 1]: that as a persistent problem. I think today it's an opportunity for them to use it strategically.

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.120
[Guest 1]: So there is no incentive for the Chinese to resolve this dispute. India is not necessarily

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.280
[Guest 1]: going to be, like I said, they don't necessarily see India as a power which is going to necessarily

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:30.960
[Guest 1]: move to alter the status quo. They see India as a status quo power. So they want to come

01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:35.480
[Guest 1]: to a point where the Indians would either agree to what your formulation is, if not,

01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:39.600
[Guest 1]: and if you even want to say current status quo becomes international boundary. For that,

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:45.440
[Guest 1]: you need to be feeling comfortable enough in the political position of the leader, which

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:49.240
[Guest 1]: I guess they're right now, but also the fact that you need to feel comfortable about your

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:53.880
[Guest 1]: control over Tibet and the idea that you control Tibet. Increasingly, that's become the bigger

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:59.000
[Guest 1]: issue is how do you see, how do you see Arunachal Pradesh? The fact that Chinese in the last

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:04.920
[Guest 1]: couple of years have internally issued revised maps, demarcating places in Arunachal Pradesh

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.720
[Guest 1]: with Chinese names and drawing them in Chinese. It tells you that they're not serious about

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.720
[Guest 1]: settling this with India at status quo levels. And they want to sort of pressurize India.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:17.040
[Guest 1]: If India agrees to give on some of those things in some sort of a package deal saying, okay,

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:19.760
[Guest 1]: you can take this and we'll take that. Very difficult for an Indian government to give

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:23.560
[Guest 1]: up Arunachal Pradesh. But if India was to agree to something like that, the Chinese

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:27.680
[Guest 1]: would be game for it. I don't think that they'll see no value in settling this. But at the

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:30.440
[Guest 1]: moment, the fact that they want to keep it alive and they don't want to necessarily even

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:34.280
[Guest 1]: share their formal claims with you, tells you that they want to use it as a strategic,

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:37.440
[Guest 1]: they want to use it as a lever. Anytime you need it, you can use it.

01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:41.400
[Guest 2]: And I would also say China has settled its territorial disputes with many countries,

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:46.120
[Guest 2]: but created new territorial disputes as well on the maritime domain.

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:51.080
[Guest 1]: So the interesting thing about the South China Sea is that it's about, so one of the reasons

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:56.160
[Guest 1]: of how these disputes have come about, right? So in 49, once the PRC is formed, the Communist

01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:59.760
[Guest 1]: Party does not necessarily have a sense of bureaucracy and state apparatus. I mean, it's

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:04.320
[Guest 1]: not like when India got independence, there was a trained bureaucracy. These were ragtag

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:09.400
[Guest 1]: fighters who were running around the country, you know, predominantly propelled by villagers

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:14.160
[Guest 1]: and farmers, peasants and workers. For them to suddenly figure out, the idea that you

01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:18.920
[Guest 1]: imagine where your boundaries lie, and this is where my territory ends, and this is sovereignty

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:24.720
[Guest 1]: therefore, is a difficult concept to grasp. So what you take is what you get from the

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:28.600
[Guest 1]: past. And the idea of the South China Sea, this is an interesting argument of how your

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:35.920
[Guest 1]: claims, how the claims develop, how this nine-dash line developed. In 1911-12, there was a line

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:40.800
[Guest 1]: drawn by some researcher. In the 30s, another researcher had taken it up and two of his

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:46.000
[Guest 1]: students took up from their teacher's course material. That got translated to a forum in

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.760
[Guest 1]: Beijing in the 40s. That when the Communist Party came to power, they saw this as, oh,

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:54.400
[Guest 1]: okay, this makes sense, this is probably our boundaries. And that becomes part of your

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.720
[Guest 1]: sort of imagination going forward that this is, this dashed line is part of Chinese territory.

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:02.200
[Guest 1]: Now, if you go back further, further, further, you'll find many more examples of when it

01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:05.480
[Guest 1]: was and when it wasn't. And the Chinese have subsequently done that. When the Communist

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:09.120
[Guest 1]: Party came to power, they didn't have a sense of this. You got this piece of paper and you

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:14.280
[Guest 1]: thought this makes sense. But the origins of that line, the significance of it to your

01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:18.760
[Guest 1]: national identity and your territorial integrity and your sovereignty is manufactured over

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:25.200
[Guest 1]: a number of years. And it's manufactured because, in part, that's how you start imagining what

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:30.000
[Guest 1]: you were. So part of that is this creation of new ideas, but part of that is also just

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.320
[Guest 1]: you get this institutional memory from somewhere and you start to incorporate it because that's

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.960
[Guest 1]: how you want to imagine your greatness going forward. And that's what happens in most of

01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:38.960
[Guest 2]: these disputes.

01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:44.280
[Guest 2]: I would like to say that China doing border incidents like the case of Doklam is actually

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:51.040
[Guest 2]: a strategic mistake on their part, because that is going to develop this whole narrative

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:56.320
[Guest 2]: in India. See, nationalism will always come up on these issues, right? And then it will

01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:01.560
[Guest 2]: develop a narrative in India that, you know, China is only an adversary and nothing else.

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:06.400
[Guest 2]: So that from a, if you take a longer arc for China, it is not good that you are going to

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:11.840
[Guest 2]: just antagonize a whole set of Indians for some small border dispute, right? It's not

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:16.640
[Guest 2]: as if India, they can run over India. It's not possible. We are nuclear powers. It's

01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:20.680
[Guest 2]: not as if they are going to take over Arunachal Pradesh and India is not going to do anything.

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:25.800
[Guest 2]: So the gains for them from any of these border disputes are very little, but they have a

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:27.200
[Guest 2]: lot more to lose.

01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:31.840
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on now to how Pakistan looks at India. And I know you're looking at me with

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:37.960
[Amit Varma]: disapproval because I've moved closer geographically from the US to China to Pakistan. So this

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:42.400
[Amit Varma]: happens to be the default neighborhood that I have chosen. So how does Pakistan look at

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:47.000
[Amit Varma]: India and does Pakistan have a foreign policy towards India or a military jihadi policy?

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.240
[Guest 2]: Both because both entities exist, but it is predominantly, see in Pakistan, it is very

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:59.880
[Guest 2]: clear that defense, anything related to India is the domain of the military jihadi complex.

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:07.200
[Guest 2]: So the putative state does not have that much to say. So they do have a policy and their

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:14.640
[Guest 2]: policy is to ensure that, you know, India doesn't. It's just like how in India now you

01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:19.840
[Guest 2]: see everything being talked about with a reference to Pakistan. In Pakistan, it's been there

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:25.680
[Guest 2]: for many, many years, right? Like everything you see it from an Indian lens. So that sort

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:32.720
[Guest 2]: of continues. What has hurt them is that their economy has also faltered because of this,

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:36.680
[Guest 2]: because of the terrorists. Terrorism is an instrument of their foreign policy. It has

01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:43.520
[Guest 2]: bitten them back. And because of that, their own strength in to hurt India has reduced.

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:48.240
[Guest 2]: And that's why there is a bit of rethinking in certain quarters there as well. A lot of

01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:52.680
[Guest 2]: military jihadi rethink is happening. Now just think of it, right? They were on the

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:57.760
[Guest 2]: gravy train from the US. They used to get this coalition support funds and all that.

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:03.440
[Guest 2]: Now US policy changed because this terrorism had an impact on US as well. And the narrative

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:07.520
[Guest 2]: in the US changed that, you know, Pakistan is not a good partner.

01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:11.800
[Amit Varma]: And is that narrative changing got something to do with India's foreign policy? Is that

01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:16.840
[Amit Varma]: a foreign policy success for us? Did we manipulate that in some way or did it change on its own?

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:24.320
[Guest 2]: That is, I think, Pakistan's own doing. India did have a role. I think just the fact that

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:30.640
[Guest 2]: India was growing from 2004 to 2009, that itself was India's biggest contribution to

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:36.800
[Guest 2]: change this narrative. But apart from that, Pakistan did many things on its own. And it

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:42.320
[Guest 2]: helped in developing a narrative in the US that, you know, Pakistan is not a partner

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:49.080
[Guest 2]: which has the same interests as that of the US. So now that has happened, they are also

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:55.040
[Guest 2]: feeling the pinch, right? No investments coming in, everyone in the world thinking of Pakistan

01:43:55.040 --> 01:44:01.240
[Guest 2]: as the state which has sponsored terrorism. So because of that, there is a lot of terrorism

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:05.880
[Guest 2]: incidents happening within Pakistan itself, right? So that's why there is on the military

01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:11.280
[Guest 2]: jihadi complex also, there is a lot of churn happening internally, you know, and that is

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:13.400
[Guest 2]: what is going on currently.

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:18.040
[Amit Varma]: And has the relationship with China changed the incentives for them? Because with China

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:22.640
[Amit Varma]: investing so much in Pakistan, they would obviously want Pakistan to be stable and not

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:27.800
[Amit Varma]: muck around and especially not get into a war with India. Does that then affect us positively

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:31.440
[Amit Varma]: because it changes Pakistan's behaviour towards us?

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:36.000
[Guest 1]: So my sense is that the jury is out on that. In theory, yes. In theory, yes, the fact that

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.240
[Guest 1]: the Chinese are engaged in the region much more, and they are Pakistan's primary benefactor,

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:44.120
[Guest 1]: they would, you would assume that they would want greater stability, but I'm not necessarily

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:46.160
[Amit Varma]: sure that that's actually played out.

01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:48.160
[Guest 1]: Because they might not be rational actors as the model assumes.

01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:52.520
[Guest 1]: They might not be rational actors and also the sense that you know, you until instability

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:58.040
[Guest 1]: in India caused by Pakistan based actors also helps China, it keeps India sort of, you know,

01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:01.840
[Guest 1]: left lost out a little bit. And I think that is one of the things that actually plays out.

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:07.120
[Guest 1]: The other thing is that you want to necessarily have instability at till a certain threshold,

01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:11.360
[Guest 1]: you don't want it to cross a certain threshold. And I think that's where what we are seeing

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:15.000
[Guest 1]: is being played out. So when you see that things can escalate, which is what happened

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.040
[Guest 1]: in February last year, you will see the Chinese also actively getting involved in saying guys,

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:23.320
[Guest 1]: calm down, calm down. And all right, you know, the Indian foreign minister is in Beijing,

01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:26.280
[Guest 1]: and we're talking about these things. And we're going to say, yes, yes, we are statement

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:29.680
[Guest 1]: is going to say, let's eradicate the root causes of terrorism. And then two weeks later,

01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:32.560
[Guest 1]: once the Pakistani foreign minister comes in, he says, yes, yes, what we mean by root

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:36.840
[Guest 1]: causes of terrorism is development. So you might end up doing some of those things because

01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:40.480
[Guest 1]: and that tells you that the sense is that let's keep certain threshold of instability

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:44.560
[Guest 1]: is fine. The challenge for the Chinese going forward, and that would be well, how do you

01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:50.320
[Guest 1]: stop to breed that instability? You need actors which are funded, supported by state instruments,

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:53.800
[Guest 1]: the military jihadi complex, and you need the jihadis also, which are non state actors

01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:57.720
[Guest 1]: effectively, or definitionally wise, they are non state actors, how are you going to

01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:03.680
[Guest 1]: contain them from then turning on to the Chinese who are working in Pakistan? I mean, let's

01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:08.080
[Guest 1]: remember those many years ago when that Lal Masjid siege happened in Lahore, it was the

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:12.280
[Guest 1]: Chinese who were taken hostages. And the frustration of those people who took the Chinese hostages

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:16.120
[Guest 1]: was essentially that the justification was that they are perverting our culture by their

01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:20.880
[Guest 1]: massage parlours. So as you have more Chinese engaged in Pakistan, how do you then keep

01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:24.680
[Guest 1]: this sort of thing separated, that there won't be a backlash against you. And there are already

01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:28.380
[Guest 1]: certain cases where there is a backlash against them. Pakistan is a conservative society.

01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:33.360
[Guest 1]: And also the more, and Nitin says this always, you know, the closer they embrace the tighter

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:36.280
[Guest 1]: their embrace, the, you know, greater the tensions that they'll end up feeling. So it's

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:39.320
[Guest 1]: going to be a difficult balancing act for the Chinese to do this. But at the moment,

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:43.160
[Guest 1]: I'm not necessarily sure that the fact that the Chinese are engaged means greater stability.

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:46.720
[Amit Varma]: Theoretically, yes, but I don't think that's how it's playing out. And even theoretically,

01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:50.800
[Amit Varma]: like you said, it's probably in their interest to keep a certain threshold of conflict going

01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:55.960
[Amit Varma]: because that prevents the Indian army from changing focus to China completely. You know,

01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:01.040
[Guest 2]: as you guys were mentioning earlier. And let's look at what kind of a benefactor China is

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:05.160
[Guest 2]: towards military jihadi complex, because that is what determines their relationship with

01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:12.520
[Guest 2]: India to us. Unlike the US, US was all giving them just cash to run Afghanistan policy.

01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:17.280
[Amit Varma]: In fact, a friend of mine, when I was in Pakistan in 2006, had said that in Pakistan, they call

01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:24.200
[Guest 2]: Al-Qaeda Al-Faida, because the USA just flowed in. Yeah. But China is not a similar actor.

01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:29.780
[Guest 2]: For example, a lot of money that they're putting in is also conditional. It is loans, not grants.

01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:33.960
[Guest 2]: So there they are more involved and they are in the neighborhood. Remember, they are not

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:39.440
[Guest 2]: far away like the US is. You are talking of geographical neighborhoods. Yeah, I hope China

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:44.160
[Guest 2]: sees it. So given that they are in the neighborhood, their interests are slightly different from

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:51.800
[Guest 2]: that of the US. And remember, still, US GDP per capita is $60,000. China is $10,000. So

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:57.000
[Guest 2]: it's not as if they can give the same amount of money to Pakistan. So military jihadi complex

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.720
[Guest 2]: is going to feel the pinch of money. One, because they don't have the same guy as the

01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:07.920
[Guest 2]: US on their side. And second, China is also going to give loans and not grants. So that

01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:14.240
[Guest 1]: is going to hurt them in the short term. Yeah. I mean, apart from so traditionally where

01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:18.080
[Guest 1]: the Chinese and the Pakistanis are working, so they work together. So the military aspect

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:22.000
[Guest 1]: of the relationship dominated the relationship until very recently. At the moment, what's

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.000
[Guest 1]: happened is that while there is CPEC, and all of the conversation is about CPEC, that

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.400
[Guest 1]: military-to-military engagement has expanded significantly. In the past, there was support

01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:35.880
[Guest 1]: in Pakistan's nuclear program. But today, you're jointly developing jets, you're doing

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:41.680
[Guest 1]: submarine drills, you're expanding your theater of cooperation, now militarily, which doesn't

01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:46.200
[Guest 1]: necessarily bode well for India. And India, which is anyway concerned about this idea

01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:50.760
[Guest 1]: of the so-called string of pearls of Chinese ports all around us and Chinese potential

01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:55.360
[Guest 1]: bases all around us. In Pakistan, you're certain that it's not just whether you get a formal

01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:00.400
[Guest 1]: base or not in Gwadar, you are sufficiently sinicizing the Pakistani army in terms of

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:05.040
[Guest 1]: its equipment, which will mean that even in case of conflict, and there may not be a permanent

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:09.360
[Guest 1]: base over there, the possibilities for the Chinese to do soft basing very easily, repair,

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:12.320
[Guest 1]: maintenance, whatever they need in the Indian Ocean, if there's a conflict, they can easily

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:16.080
[Guest 1]: do it through Pakistan, even if Pakistan is not directly involved in the conflict. So

01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:20.280
[Guest 1]: that embrace is getting closer. And that embrace is probably far more dangerous for us going

01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:23.920
[Guest 1]: forward. And there's very little that we can do to contain that.

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:28.440
[Amit Varma]: So sort of, you know, I mean, obviously, in the last 10 years or so, our economy has grown

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:32.960
[Amit Varma]: significantly weaker since 2011, you know, starting with the disastrous economic policies

01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:37.400
[Amit Varma]: of Pranab Mukherjee, and then following on the Modi administration, all through all of

01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:41.000
[Amit Varma]: which I've discussed in various episodes, including Pooja Mehra, which are linked from

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.080
[Amit Varma]: the show notes. But because of all of that, our general prosperity and all of that has

01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:49.320
[Amit Varma]: gone down. And that is, of course, part of our foreign policy standing and the power

01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:53.640
[Amit Varma]: that we can wield in the world. So taking all this into account, and also taking into

01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:58.240
[Amit Varma]: account the changing currents and conflicts, which have been happening in the globe over

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:03.600
[Amit Varma]: the last 10 years, what are the sort of increased threats and opportunities that we have to

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:05.880
[Guest 2]: consider from a foreign policy perspective?

01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:12.280
[Guest 2]: The increased threats are again, I would say that if we are thinking of India as a swing

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:20.200
[Guest 2]: power, the ability for us to hurt our adversaries is decreasing, our instruments that we have

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:25.640
[Guest 2]: available will decrease. So that is what is happening over the last few years because

01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:31.080
[Guest 2]: of the economic slowdown. That means that we cannot take very strong actions against

01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:39.280
[Guest 2]: China, even if they are not doing a reciprocal action, right. And they are antagonistic towards

01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:45.800
[Guest 2]: us. There's little that we can do if we don't have the economic wherewithal. Those are the

01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:50.400
[Guest 2]: threats. I don't think there are any opportunities of slowing economy at all.

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:56.240
[Guest 1]: I think, so I agree with Pranay that our ability to use those instruments will diminish, or

01:50:56.240 --> 01:51:01.040
[Guest 1]: the capacity of those instruments will diminish. My sense is that, and my fear is this, that

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:07.080
[Guest 1]: fact might be obscured by the greater willingness of this administration to exercise what we

01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:10.880
[Guest 1]: already command as power. And that's evident in what we've done with Malaysia right now,

01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:15.320
[Guest 1]: where we decided to ban palm oil imports, because of statements made by the Malaysian

01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:19.880
[Guest 1]: Prime Minister. The exercise of some of these things will, because of course, you do command

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:24.280
[Guest 1]: certain power, will obscure the fact that your power is diminishing relatively, and

01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:28.680
[Guest 1]: because it pleases the domestic constituency. And I think that is a bigger fear that I have,

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:32.080
[Guest 1]: because that will sort of deviate away from the fact that we are actually losing out from

01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:35.040
[Guest 1]: the fact that, okay, we've done this one good thing. And I don't think there's necessarily

01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:38.640
[Guest 1]: even lessons being learned of how we are doing these things effectively, because when we

01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:43.760
[Guest 1]: did this against Nepal a couple of years ago, within by the Modi government itself, it didn't

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:49.720
[Guest 1]: necessarily lead to the gains that we wanted to. We created a blockade, it actually ended

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:54.000
[Guest 1]: up, it actually ended up with us losing out in terms of our influence in Nepal and opening

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.360
[Guest 1]: the door for greater Chinese presence in the country. So I think, but the fact that we

01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:04.920
[Guest 1]: exercised power was seen as something positive, which I think is problematic, because I don't

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:08.640
[Guest 1]: think that in itself should be seen as something positive, but it was sold as something positive,

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:09.640
[Guest 1]: right? Decisive government.

01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:17.200
[Guest 2]: Yeah, but the hope is, you will see the consequences of that will be felt by the dispersed costs

01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:21.960
[Guest 2]: of that will eventually add up, right? And that's what will change things.

01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:26.520
[Amit Varma]: Right. So, you know, so I've taken more than two hours of your time. So to kind of end

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:31.240
[Amit Varma]: the episode and move away from foreign policy towards the foreign policy ecosystem. And

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:36.280
[Amit Varma]: my question here is at a general level, public intellectuals matter, because they shape the

01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:41.400
[Amit Varma]: discourse, they seed ideas into the culture. And obviously, politics is a game of supply

01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:45.880
[Amit Varma]: and demand in the political marketplace, the parties will respond to what the people want,

01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:50.920
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth. Also, public intellectuals matter because they can shape the elites who

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:56.380
[Amit Varma]: actually hold some of the levers of government. What is it for public intellectuals like you

01:52:56.380 --> 01:53:02.200
[Amit Varma]: guys working in foreign policy? Do you actually have any sort of influence? What is like the

01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:06.600
[Amit Varma]: ecosystem for people like you? Do foreign policy professionals from across the world

01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:11.160
[Amit Varma]: get together once in a while and form a community and cry on each other's shoulders? Give me

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:12.160
[Guest 2]: a sense of that.

01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:18.440
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I think that happens a lot in foreign policy. So for example, we are in India's

01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:25.240
[Guest 2]: most globalized city in Bangalore, and we are connected to so many outside the government

01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:30.560
[Guest 2]: also, there's a lot of people to people connections. So you end up exchanging a lot of notes, so

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:36.680
[Guest 2]: you will have visitors from Australia, US, China, even. So those kinds of exchanges do

01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:43.400
[Guest 2]: happen and you talk about all these aspects. So that is one influence where you influence

01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:49.560
[Guest 2]: the other nation states. Within the country itself now, any think tank in India, for example,

01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:54.560
[Guest 2]: will generally have a foreign policy wing as well, I guess because again, domestic things

01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:58.680
[Guest 2]: are too complicated. So people generally try to have foreign policy.

01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:04.000
[Amit Varma]: But is that a box to take? Or is it like, you know, a rich body of work also developing?

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:09.720
[Guest 2]: It is developing now. And there are a lot of good original studies coming up from Indian

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:15.400
[Guest 2]: think tanks as well. So that is another ecosystem that you are tapped into. Then with the government

01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:21.160
[Guest 2]: itself, MEA has been compared to other ministries, it has been over the years, not just with

01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:26.960
[Guest 2]: this government, it is a ministry which does exchange a lot of ideas from outside the government.

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:31.720
[Guest 2]: So there has been a lot of to and fro of ideas with them as well.

01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:35.960
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I mean, if you just go back a couple of weeks ago, you had Raisena Dialogues in

01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:41.440
[Guest 1]: Delhi, massive event, mega event, a lot of the focus of strategic affairs, foreign affairs.

01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:45.100
[Guest 1]: So it's a growing ecosystem in India, according to me, it's a growing ecosystem. There's interesting

01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:47.840
[Amit Varma]: work also coming out. And it can be an influential ecosystem and

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:51.480
[Guest 1]: actual policy. Yeah, potentially, it can be an influential ecosystem. In fact, like when

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:55.760
[Guest 1]: I mentioned the MEA in the last couple of months, actually, in the last couple of years,

01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:59.960
[Guest 1]: they appointed Ashok Malik as an external consultant. They've also put out requirements

01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:06.040
[Guest 1]: for an external consultant specifically on China. So they have looked at expertise beyond

01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:09.840
[Guest 1]: government, which is a good thing. In our engagement, what we realized is that if you

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:13.720
[Guest 1]: reach out, you tend to at least get heard. And increasingly, we felt that we're getting

01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:17.920
[Guest 1]: heard, whether those things are being taken up or is another matter altogether. And there

01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:22.000
[Guest 1]: are multiple interests that one needs to consider when before you take up a policy recommendation,

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.240
[Guest 1]: but at least the fact that somebody sitting across the table from you and engaging with

01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:30.000
[Guest 1]: the ideas that you have, which might be very contrary to their institutional sort of, you

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.240
[Guest 1]: know, path dependence and their sense of, you know, where their government's interest

01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:37.240
[Guest 1]: lies is a positive. So the first thing is that you start getting heard. And I think

01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:42.480
[Guest 1]: that's happening. So I'm a little bit more optimistic on that. And I'm hopeful that as

01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:46.120
[Guest 1]: the ecosystem grows bigger and potentially even grows a little bit louder, the fact that

01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:50.320
[Guest 1]: there'll be diversity of voices will encourage a better debate and will make sure that government

01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:54.120
[Guest 2]: actually listens to outside voices. Yeah, I think the most important role of the public

01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:59.080
[Guest 2]: intellectual is the public part of it. So how much are we, the role in foreign policy

01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:04.680
[Guest 2]: is also similar to be able to convey to a larger body of people why foreign relations

01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:09.200
[Guest 2]: are important. How does economic growth have an impact on that? Those are important. So

01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:14.640
[Guest 2]: for example, I tried to write a column in Hindi on a lot of foreign policy matters,

01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:19.120
[Guest 2]: because I think we need to convey those ideas in as many languages. Otherwise, it will be

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:24.680
[Guest 2]: just seen as these bunch of people doing and for some, again, there is that insular tendency

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:29.000
[Guest 2]: in India as well, like in China, that why bother about those things, we have enough

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:35.040
[Guest 2]: problems of our own, we are such a big continent sized country, let's only do things here.

01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:40.000
[Guest 2]: And we need to realize that foreign policy is also an instrument for us to grow, for

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.960
[Guest 2]: us to do well, for us to bring Yogakshema and that's why the public intellectual needs

01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:49.400
[Amit Varma]: to be able to convey those ideas to a larger body of people. And on that hopeful note of

01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:53.640
[Amit Varma]: Yogakshema, which I know we all aspire to, and I hope we all succeed in achieving. Thank

01:56:53.640 --> 01:57:01.320
[Amit Varma]: you so much, guys, for coming on the show. And now let's get a quick update on what is

01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:08.800
[Amit Varma]: happening with COVID-19. This update is being recorded on April 23. Pranay and Manoj, welcome

01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:09.800
[Guest 2]: back.

01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.800
[Guest 2]: Thanks, Amit. Good to be here in a new world.

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:17.640
[Guest 1]: Yeah, thanks, Amit. Good to be here and sharing heat in my house.

01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:23.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, we are all in sharing heat because we have turned off the fan and sort of kindly

01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:28.400
[Amit Varma]: bear with us if some outside noises do creep in. Pranay, I want to turn to you next. My

01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:33.880
[Amit Varma]: assumption is that, you know, there is that old saying about there are years when nothing

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:39.240
[Amit Varma]: happens. And then there is a week when years happen. And clearly, I think the last few

01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:44.680
[Amit Varma]: weeks have just changed the world entirely. Is that also true for foreign policy?

01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:52.080
[Guest 2]: Yeah, thanks, Amit. I think, first of all, whatever sort of prognosis that we have now

01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:56.640
[Guest 2]: is very tentative, right? Because the world is still evolving. And we don't know what's

01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:01.640
[Guest 2]: going to happen next. But I was trying to look at, are there any frameworks through

01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:07.280
[Guest 2]: which we can understand what might happen next? So from that perspective, yes, it looks

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:13.640
[Guest 2]: like there will be fundamental change in how geopolitics operates and also fundamental

01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:19.440
[Guest 2]: change in how the geoeconomics of the world is operating. So in a sense, yes, I do see

01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:22.040
[Guest 2]: a significant change coming to the world.

01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:26.560
[Amit Varma]: And Manoj, at the heart of this has been a country that you know very deeply and have

01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:31.280
[Amit Varma]: studied very carefully, which is China, you know, give me a little bit of that, not just

01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:37.680
[Amit Varma]: from a foreign policy sense. But, you know, China is so opaque and so mysterious to outsiders.

01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:43.520
[Amit Varma]: Give me a sense of what's been happening there. Internally, how has it been, you know, affected

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:48.320
[Amit Varma]: internally as far as the politics and the society is concerned, and how that will then

01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:52.520
[Amit Varma]: go on to impact the way they look at the world and the way the world looks at them?

01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:57.840
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I think, I think there's been a sort of strange three, four months from their perspective

01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:01.920
[Guest 1]: also. I mean, if you go back to January, one would have, you know, the way things were

01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:07.240
[Guest 1]: happening in China, all the reportage was like, okay, this is a black swan event. And,

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:12.560
[Guest 1]: you know, Chinese politics have changed, there's fundamental insecurity in the country. Potentially,

01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:16.920
[Guest 1]: the party would collapse. And this is the biggest test ever, and so on and so forth.

01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:19.920
[Guest 1]: And three months down the road, lo and behold, there's all this stuff about, I mean, The

01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:24.520
[Guest 1]: Economist had a cover recently, which was about, has China already won? So it's quite

01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:29.320
[Guest 1]: a strange turnaround in three, three and a half months of how this has played out. Domestically,

01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:33.680
[Guest 1]: I think there's lots that, I mean, there's lots that's happening, which is uncovered.

01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:40.640
[Guest 1]: So there's lots of public anger. There's lots of elite anger in China. We've seen that with

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:46.960
[Guest 1]: social media posts by say, people like Ran Zhejiang, or people like Xu Xiaorun. These

01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:52.800
[Guest 1]: are people who sort of very publicly criticized Xi Jinping. And Xu Xiaorun is a professor

01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:59.760
[Guest 1]: who's been a critic of Xi Jinping. Ran Zhejiang is among the elite. He's sort of a party tycoon.

01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:04.080
[Guest 1]: And he sort of very publicly criticized Xi Jinping in a social media post calling him,

02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:08.880
[Guest 1]: saying that the emperor clearly has no clothes. And all of these guys are now under so called

02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:13.360
[Guest 1]: investigation. But it tells you that there is a pushback that's happening even among

02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:17.280
[Guest 1]: the elite circles. And that doesn't tell you that Xi Jinping is going to lose control of the party,

02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:20.480
[Guest 1]: or that the party is going to collapse. But it just tells you that there is a lot of churning

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:25.120
[Guest 1]: that's taking place within the party. In terms of the people of Wuhan, I mean, today in India,

02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:31.920
[Guest 1]: we've been in lockdown for just about a month. And there's been tumult, there's been frustration,

02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:36.960
[Guest 1]: there's been anger, there's been mishandling of certain things. Imagine in a place like Wuhan,

02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:43.920
[Guest 1]: where the lockdown lasted for 76 days. Plus, you know, the fact that the government initially

02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:48.880
[Guest 1]: failed to deal with the crisis, and that sense of anger of the number of deaths that have taken

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:53.600
[Guest 1]: place in that city in Hubei province. So there is a lot of anger in terms of what happened

02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:58.000
[Guest 1]: initially, subsequently, what's going to happen with the economy, because clearly unemployment

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:02.960
[Guest 1]: and all that is going to rise. And also how the party sort of narrative has worked. I mean,

02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:08.320
[Guest 1]: I'll give you one example of the sense of frustration. When the lockdown was about to

02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:13.840
[Guest 1]: be lifted in Wuhan, which is in early April, you had an attempt by the local party leadership to

02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:18.400
[Guest 1]: run something called a gratitude campaign, basically asking people to be thankful to

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:24.080
[Guest 1]: the party for saving them from this virus. It clearly did go down well with the people of Wuhan.

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:29.680
[Guest 1]: So it just tells you that there's a lot of churn. So some of the stuff about China winning is

02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:35.200
[Guest 1]: premature. But it's also remarkable how from a point in sort of mid January, when we thought

02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:40.880
[Guest 1]: that, okay, this might be the unravelling in some ways, and that was one of the perceptions

02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:46.160
[Guest 1]: to today, the sense that, okay, China has recovered, it's reopening, and anger in the

02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:50.720
[Guest 1]: world outside saying things like, how is that they've managed to control it while we are still

02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:54.800
[Guest 1]: struggling, and that sort of playing out. So it's been an interesting couple of months for them.

02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:59.280
[Guest 1]: And I think there's going to be lots of difficult times going ahead, even for them,

02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:03.440
[Amit Varma]: just to recover from all of this. I'm a bit confused about, you know,

02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:08.240
[Amit Varma]: the narrative shift to China having won, because it would seem to me that there is

02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:14.880
[Amit Varma]: across the world, a lot of anger at China, both in sort of at the level of the heads of government

02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:20.880
[Amit Varma]: with the things that Trump says, etc. But also there is a lot of native anti Chinese sentiment

02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:27.280
[Amit Varma]: coming out in various places, such as quite disturbingly in even India. And so what is the

02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:33.840
[Amit Varma]: argument behind saying that this is a victory of some sort for China or enhances its nature in the

02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:39.920
[Guest 1]: world? Yeah, I think the argument is essentially that the Chinese economy, if you look at even

02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:44.800
[Guest 1]: IMF projections, China takes an economic hit, but the Chinese economy still continues to grow at

02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:50.320
[Guest 1]: about 1.2% this year, whereas others take a deeper hit and the recovery next year, at least based on

02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:56.640
[Guest 1]: IMF projections is to next year's growth target growth rate expectation is 9.2%. And this is all

02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:00.480
[Guest 1]: obviously projections with lots of ifs and buts. But the assumption is that the Chinese have

02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:05.120
[Guest 1]: started getting back to work, which people didn't think would have happened so soon.

02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:10.480
[Guest 1]: And the challenge is that the rest of the world is right now facing. So that's one thing

02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:16.000
[Guest 1]: is the economic challenge. So say from an Indian perspective, how we mitigate the challenge of the

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:21.040
[Guest 1]: economic slowdown that's going to come down the road would be determining where we eventually

02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:27.360
[Guest 1]: stand globally. From the anger perspective, those things have to still play out. Despite the anger

02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:33.520
[Guest 1]: in the US and despite the use of terms like Chinese virus and all of that, and even cases

02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:38.960
[Guest 1]: being filed in the US against the Chinese government, China is still central to provision

02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:46.400
[Guest 1]: of medical supplies, ventilators, masks, PPE. Even in the West, US governors have been signing deals

02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:50.000
[Guest 1]: with Chinese entities and buying all of this. In Europe, they've been buying all of this.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.840
[Guest 1]: There's been criticism of the poor quality of all of this. But the fact that China has been

02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:59.520
[Guest 1]: has emerged as the center in terms of the heart of the manufacturing of all of this. And Xi Jinping

02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:04.880
[Guest 1]: sort of captures this when he says that we need to build a health Silk Road as if we didn't have

02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:10.400
[Guest 1]: enough Silk Roads. But it just tells you that they've tried to move in the center of the world

02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:15.280
[Guest 1]: sort of in terms of manufacturing of some what's what's an essential supply. But there are challenges

02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:18.320
[Guest 1]: to that. So I don't sort of agree with the narrative that the Chinese have won in any

02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:25.360
[Guest 1]: which way. I think the narrative is not useful. But that's what's catching hold from that point

02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:30.560
[Guest 1]: of view that you know, and it's largely because the fact that you've seen a recovery from what

02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:35.440
[Guest 1]: one had anticipated in January, to what one is seeing today. And comparison what one had

02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:39.120
[Guest 1]: anticipated in the world, nobody anticipated that this would be the state of the world.

02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:42.960
[Guest 1]: But where the world is heading and particularly how the developed world, the Western world has

02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:48.640
[Guest 1]: handled this pandemic, how the US has handled it, how your parts of Europe have handled it. That's

02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:53.200
[Guest 1]: what's giving you the sense that the Chinese have managed to control this. And again, if you just

02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:59.360
[Guest 1]: look at death tolls, now, nobody takes Chinese numbers on face value. But you know, the death

02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:03.200
[Guest 1]: toll, if you compare it to what's happening in the US and what's happening in China, that those

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:06.480
[Guest 1]: sort of things make a difference in terms of how the public perception of all of this is playing

02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:12.720
[Guest 1]: out. So I don't think the narrative is true, or is borne out by deeper consideration. And there's

02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:17.280
[Guest 1]: lots of ifs and buts going down the road. What happens to supply chains in the future? Do companies

02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:22.080
[Guest 1]: stay in China? What sort of restrictions come about in terms of global trade? All of that is

02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:26.480
[Guest 1]: sort of play a role. But at the moment, just the fact that the Chinese have recovered, or seemingly

02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:32.480
[Guest 1]: recovered with about 80 to 85% of, you know, factory activity, business activity, back to

02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:36.480
[Guest 1]: somewhat normalcy. That's the kind of thing that's fueling this narrative.

02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:41.680
[Amit Varma]: Pranay, earlier when we were chatting before the show, you mentioned how, you know, there are

02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:46.640
[Amit Varma]: implications of COVID-19 across sort of two margins, and one is geopolitical, and one is

02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:52.400
[Amit Varma]: geoeconomic. Can you shed some light on what you mean by these two terms? And, you know, what kind

02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:58.960
[Guest 2]: of impacts you're looking at? Right. So when I'm talking about geopolitics, it's basically

02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:05.600
[Guest 2]: the distribution of power across the world, right? Because we discussed earlier, how power is the

02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:12.320
[Guest 2]: most important determinant in this amoral world of international relations. So the geopolitical axis

02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:19.040
[Guest 2]: looks at how has the distribution of power changed because of what happened over the last two months,

02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:25.280
[Guest 2]: right? So if you look at that, the overall understanding that we have currently is that

02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:31.760
[Guest 2]: sort of COVID-19 accelerates the competition and confrontation between U.S. and China,

02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:38.960
[Guest 2]: while simultaneously it reduces the absolute power of both of them, right? So what it means is that

02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:44.800
[Guest 2]: U.S. and China will remain the two major poles even after what has happened, but their combined

02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:50.640
[Guest 2]: leverage has sort of decreased because of what has happened, right? Both U.S. has been hit adversely,

02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:56.960
[Guest 2]: and even China has been hit adversely. And even in the future, it's going to be difficult for

02:06:56.960 --> 02:07:05.200
[Guest 2]: the economy to be up on its feet like the previous times. So it's going to hit both of them, okay?

02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:11.600
[Guest 2]: So what it means is, essentially, there is also an opportunity for other powers now. So reduction

02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:17.360
[Guest 2]: in the power of U.S. and China means that some other middle powers will be able to extract

02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:23.200
[Guest 2]: some more concessions from either of them, right? So that is one more thing. It of course depends

02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:28.160
[Guest 2]: on what those middle powers do internally and domestically, but there is an opportunity here.

02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:34.960
[Guest 2]: Second, between U.S. and China itself, there is this confrontation which was going on is

02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:40.960
[Guest 2]: likely to continue, right? We don't see the fact that U.S. and China will suddenly bury the hatchet

02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:48.080
[Guest 2]: and then go on with this. So it might not lead to a direct war. So it is more like the last Cold War

02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:54.720
[Guest 2]: which we had, where there was confrontation, competition, but there wasn't any exchange of

02:07:54.720 --> 02:08:00.800
[Guest 2]: arms directly for extended periods of time, right? So that is more likely. The difference between

02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:06.800
[Guest 2]: that Cold War and this one is that during that Cold War time, both the major powers, U.S. and

02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:13.040
[Guest 2]: USSR were ascendant at that particular point of time when it started. But in this case, what you

02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:22.960
[Guest 2]: see is both of the countries which are involved have been hit adversely. So their absolute power

02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:29.360
[Guest 2]: has declined because of COVID-19. And that's where we call this the new Cold War.

02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:34.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. So just to sort of, I want to like unpack one part of that a little bit. When you talk about

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:40.080
[Amit Varma]: the combined leverage of the USA and China decreasing because of COVID-19,

02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:47.360
[Amit Varma]: one, is it then the case that somebody else's leverage increases? And two, if not, is it because

02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:53.600
[Amit Varma]: that the world overall becomes a little more insular and a little less globalized because of

02:08:53.600 --> 02:09:02.320
[Guest 2]: this? Yeah. So if you look at this from a power angle, it's the fact that because the absolute

02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:09.840
[Guest 2]: powers of both U.S. and China decreases, it's not as if they can force a lot of other countries

02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:18.880
[Guest 2]: to do whatever U.S. and China want. So in that sense, there might be some more bargaining power,

02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:24.400
[Guest 2]: which the other countries have. Specifically, look at China as well. So we were talking about

02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:31.120
[Guest 2]: the one big project that China has for the world is about the Belt and Road Initiative. And it

02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:40.400
[Guest 2]: depends significantly on investing excess capacity abroad. Now, if it wants, with this COVID-19,

02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:45.840
[Guest 2]: it would want to do that even more given the situation that China is in. But those powers

02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:53.040
[Guest 2]: where it can invest now in these new circumstances has decreased even further, right? Because the

02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:58.000
[Guest 2]: entire world is going through this, which means countries like India, countries which are

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:06.000
[Guest 2]: significantly big economic zones become even more important to China. So from that angle,

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:12.480
[Guest 2]: it's sort of bargaining power of some other middle powers who get things back up domestically

02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:20.000
[Amit Varma]: correct. It improves a bit. Right. And Manoj, coming back to China, I mean, one sort of

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:31.040
[Amit Varma]: throwaway question I have here is that, how do they look at the pronouncements that come out of

02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:35.600
[Amit Varma]: Trump's Twitter feed? I mean, do they just look at him as a loose cannon who they have to ignore

02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:45.840
[Amit Varma]: and indulge while, you know, geopolitics proceeds along other lines, back channels? Or do Trump's

02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:50.880
[Amit Varma]: do Trump's rants actually have a chance of making the relationship much worse? How does one handle

02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:57.280
[Guest 1]: something like that? Yeah, no, I think, I think Trump has an impact. And I think the Chinese,

02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:01.360
[Guest 1]: it's been four years, and I think they're still sort of trying to figure out where this man comes

02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:06.880
[Guest 1]: from and what he does. I think the Twitter sort of, so for example, his use of the term Chinese

02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:11.760
[Guest 1]: virus, it clearly hit a runoff. I don't think that there is any sort of two ways about it.

02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:16.080
[Guest 1]: I think the sort of unpredictability, I think they've somewhere sort of gotten used to the

02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:23.360
[Guest 1]: unpredictability of Trump. But I think this is going to be a difficult period to predict anything

02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:27.600
[Guest 1]: even more so than the last three years. And that's because the US is heading into an election season.

02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:33.600
[Guest 1]: So Trump is likely to be far more unhinged. And the Chinese are likely to be very sensitive to

02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:37.680
[Guest 1]: this. And they're not likely to be sensitive in the context of just from the point of view that,

02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:43.440
[Guest 1]: you know, diplomacy will continue, things will continue. But what sort of impact this has on

02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:50.160
[Guest 1]: their domestic narrative? To me, I don't think that there is as much concern because the US

02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:58.000
[Guest 1]: China relationship, although right now, as bad as it has ever been in the last 40 years, there's

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:02.480
[Guest 1]: still a baseline understanding that exists that, you know, yes, we can compete, but conflict is

02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:10.480
[Guest 1]: not in anybody's interest. So at least they can take that as one thing away. So there's Trump's

02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:16.720
[Guest 1]: pronouncements, Trump's unpredictability creates some tensions, specific tensions. But that's one

02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:22.640
[Guest 1]: part of it. The broader tension would be what's happening at a bipartisan level in US. The fact

02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:26.880
[Guest 1]: that Congress is getting even more aggressive, senators are getting even more aggressive.

02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:30.720
[Guest 1]: There are many more legislations with regard to blocking Chinese companies. To me, that would be

02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:35.840
[Guest 1]: that would be a greater concern for them in the long term. In the short term, I think diplomacy

02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:40.400
[Guest 1]: will continue, they will continue to work together in whatever limited capacity that they are right

02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:45.200
[Guest 1]: now. With regard to dealing with this pandemic, there's so much more that the US and China can do

02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:51.200
[Guest 1]: and they're not doing because there is deep friction. There is a positive side to all of this

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:57.600
[Guest 1]: animosity with the US from a Chinese perspective to me. And that's how this plays out domestically.

02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:03.440
[Guest 1]: So every time sort of Trump does something or the US pushes back on something, where it need not.

02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:09.680
[Guest 1]: So for example, when China was caught in this racism scandal with Africa over the last couple

02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:17.040
[Guest 1]: of weeks, they were digging themselves deeper. And it's the moment the Americans got involved

02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:21.280
[Guest 1]: in the State Department issued a statement saying, unfortunately, the xenophobia is coming

02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:26.880
[Guest 1]: from China, and so on and so forth. You saw the Chinese pivot on the narrative and say,

02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:32.560
[Guest 1]: well, look, this is these Americans are trying to sort of drive a wedge between us and the Africans.

02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:36.480
[Guest 1]: And that's the narrative that is sold in Africa. Now, it's not like the African states that were

02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:41.840
[Guest 1]: concerned about racism by that narrative, but it has an impact on public perception also.

02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:49.120
[Guest 1]: Given, you know, the Trump's record in Africa is not great. He's famous for calling him calling

02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:54.640
[Guest 1]: the African countries along with others, shithole countries. So I don't think it necessarily,

02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:59.840
[Guest 1]: you know, it helps the Chinese from a propaganda purposes in some of these cases and also

02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:05.520
[Guest 1]: domestically, because then you can ask people to rally around the party in a sort of nationalistic

02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:09.520
[Guest 1]: power, given that the US is acting this way against you. But at an international level,

02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:16.400
[Guest 1]: it causes disruptions, it causes disruptions in terms of what more can be done to, you know,

02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:21.520
[Guest 1]: deal with the pandemic. So it limits cooperation. That's to me, that's the sort of Trump effect.

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:27.920
[Guest 1]: But the deeper concern is with regard to what's happening in US polity with regard to China,

02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:33.600
[Guest 1]: the fact that different states are filing cases against the Chinese government, the fact that

02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:38.480
[Guest 1]: at a bipartisan level, Congress is pushing through new legislation to restrict business and trade

02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:43.040
[Guest 1]: with China. Those are the kind of things that will outlast Trump. And I think that would be

02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:48.000
[Guest 1]: their bigger concern. That's how sort of I would look at what's happening in that relationship.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:54.640
[Guest 2]: And Manoj, there is China's own version of aggressive Twitter diplomacy as well,

02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:58.880
[Guest 2]: right, which has taken sort of bigger shape during these times.

02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:03.600
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, the term for all of that is wolf warrior diplomacy, right,

02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:09.120
[Guest 1]: coming from the movie Wolf Warrior, which is a terrible movie. And I suffered through it.

02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:16.000
[Guest 1]: But if you sort of the idea that, you know, Chinese diplomats and Chinese foreign ministry

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:21.040
[Guest 1]: spokesperson are going to be far more aggressive on social media, they're going to peddle conspiracy

02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:27.120
[Guest 1]: theories, and do much more of that and be far more combative. Some of that really actually

02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:31.760
[Guest 1]: falls flat, and they sort of land themselves in far greater problems. But the fact that the US

02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:38.880
[Guest 1]: response, often with even more provocative, unpredictable nonsense, where it can actually

02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:42.960
[Guest 1]: let the Chinese sort of tie themselves up in knots. That's where I think the problem sort of

02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:47.520
[Guest 1]: is in the way that's playing out either neither side is doing each other a favor by doing that,

02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:51.760
[Guest 1]: you know, they're doing themselves a favor by doing that. They're actually helping domestic

02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:57.440
[Guest 1]: nationalists forward in each side, which is, you know, probably helps at domestic politics level,

02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:04.080
[Guest 1]: but actually constrains any sort of cooperative, you know, constructive movement forward.

02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:08.320
[Guest 1]: And I think that's the bigger threat to me at the moment than conflict, because I think both

02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:13.040
[Guest 1]: sides understand that conflict would be deeply damaging. And, you know, speaking of domestic

02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:17.280
[Amit Varma]: politics, one trend that's, of course, been happening over the last few years, and will

02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:22.640
[Amit Varma]: probably be exacerbated by this is the rise of economic nationalism. And Pranay, you were

02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:28.800
[Amit Varma]: mentioning earlier about how, you know, this is something that has an impact on the liberal

02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:33.840
[Amit Varma]: economic order. Can you expand on that a little bit? Yeah, so the second axis of the New World

02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:39.520
[Guest 2]: Order, which we were talking about, one was geopolitics, the second one is geoeconomics,

02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:47.680
[Guest 2]: right? That talks about what will be the general trends in economic relationships between countries,

02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:54.160
[Guest 2]: right? And on that, I think COVID-19 will have a much more significant impact. And let's see

02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:59.200
[Guest 2]: what's happening in that world, right? First, we are already sort of entering into a global

02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:06.960
[Guest 2]: recession phase in the short run. And a lot of people believe that a V-shaped recovery, which

02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:11.520
[Guest 2]: macroeconomists keep talking about is quite unlikely, right? So you will still have,

02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:18.080
[Guest 2]: over the next few couple of years, at least even if we don't have a recession, we'll have a secular

02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:24.640
[Guest 2]: stagnation of sorts. And we are going to be, it's going to be quite some time before we go back to

02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:30.000
[Guest 2]: consumption and production levels like we had before COVID, right? So that is one sort of a

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:37.440
[Guest 2]: big trend. The second one is just the fact that international labor mobility will drop significantly,

02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:45.520
[Guest 2]: right? Already all travel is stopped. So, and US stopped immigration, right? A couple of days back.

02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:51.520
[Guest 2]: So we might say that it's happening only for the time being, but this will have some

02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:58.080
[Guest 2]: impact for the long-term foreign policies of these countries as well. So there will be some

02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:03.520
[Guest 2]: inertia for these countries to get back to the old days, right? So international labor mobility

02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:10.000
[Guest 2]: has decreased. Large capital flows now will be restricted to only relatively high performing

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:15.280
[Guest 2]: and high return yielding countries, right? Because now no one has excess capital. They would want to

02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:20.960
[Guest 2]: be very judicious with what the capital they have, right? So that is one thing. And then good

02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:29.360
[Guest 2]: and services trade between the countries in the, with the US and the countries aligned with China,

02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:36.320
[Guest 2]: that might decrease somewhat if this sort of confrontation increases. So that is why I was

02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:40.560
[Guest 2]: saying that the liberal economic order, which was underpinned by these three things, right?

02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:47.600
[Guest 2]: The free movement of labor, capital, goods, services, that is sort of going to take a setback.

02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:53.360
[Guest 2]: The third angle that I see coming from all this is just this whole idea of economic nationalism

02:18:54.000 --> 02:19:00.400
[Guest 2]: and already people are using, scarily using these terms like de-globalization, etc, right? So

02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:09.120
[Guest 2]: what we might see is that until now there was this consensus that corporates and global

02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:15.520
[Guest 2]: manufacturing can happen anywhere in the world. It's fine because the supply chains will sort

02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:21.440
[Guest 2]: out things for themselves. We will produce according to our comparative advantage and

02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:27.920
[Guest 2]: we'll be all right. But now look at this after COVID-19, many nation states might do a hard

02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:33.840
[Guest 2]: rethink on this. So they might think that global manufacturing should move away from this

02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:40.960
[Guest 2]: just-in-time kind of thinking to just-in-case type of thinking, right? Which means they are

02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:45.920
[Guest 2]: going to plan for contingencies. They are going to plan for a repeat of what has happened now.

02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:51.360
[Guest 2]: So they are going to try and build some redundancy in these supply chains, right? Which means they

02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:57.360
[Guest 2]: are going to instruct some companies to do local sourcing. They are going to have more industrial

02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:04.000
[Guest 2]: policy regimes, tougher tariff regimes. We might even see more restricted trade agreements. So this

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:11.440
[Guest 2]: is what is a sorry picture actually, but we are sort of heading towards that trend in the economic

02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:16.800
[Amit Varma]: space. Yeah, it's a very scary picture and it totally, you know, goes against the concept of

02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Yogakshema, which you guys expounded upon so well in the part that we recorded in January, which

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:29.440
[Amit Varma]: brings me to my next question, which is about India. Like where is India in all of this? How

02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:34.560
[Amit Varma]: has our outlook changed? Like one, we've had a completely random and unrelated to COVID

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:42.160
[Amit Varma]: sort of pushback from, you know, the Arab states about some of the anti-Muslim sentiments

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:46.400
[Amit Varma]: expressed by some of our leaders here, which is very interesting to me. And I'll ask you about

02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:52.240
[Amit Varma]: what you guys feel about that. But also in a larger sense, how is India's foreign policy

02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:58.240
[Amit Varma]: impacted? Does the diminished leverage of the USA and China mean that India can play

02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:04.960
[Amit Varma]: a greater part or has the incident like, you know, Trump's threat to India about the supply of

02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:09.920
[Amit Varma]: hydroxychloroquine, which of course it seems from recent tests doesn't even work on this

02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:15.440
[Amit Varma]: particular disease, has that sort of diminished India standing in the world because Modi had to

02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:21.200
[Guest 2]: cave in so easily? So what do you guys feel? Yeah, on that hydroxychloroquine thing, I

02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:28.480
[Guest 2]: I don't think that is any indication of the larger foreign policy interests or the direction

02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:35.680
[Guest 2]: of India's foreign policy, right? I mean, in fact, it is in our national interest to be able to

02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:42.240
[Guest 2]: help the US on this counter. Now we know that maybe that product even doesn't help. But anyways,

02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:49.040
[Guest 2]: if the US was requiring this and if India is providing it, it is in our interest. So I don't

02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:55.840
[Guest 2]: think that has sort of it gets played up a lot because of Modi caved in to Donald Trump. But we

02:21:55.840 --> 02:22:03.120
[Guest 2]: are looking at US and India's national interest. And there I don't think these the small thing has

02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:09.280
[Guest 2]: a really big implication. Now coming to the larger picture, yeah, as a middle power, which

02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:15.600
[Guest 2]: will still be probably one of the few countries which will still have a positive growth rate

02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:23.840
[Guest 2]: might. OK, we don't know about that. But that is why many countries will still want to look at

02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:30.240
[Guest 2]: India, will turn to India. Even the big thing that opportunity lies is, for example, I talked

02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:36.080
[Guest 2]: about how global manufacturing might want to move away from China, build some redundancies.

02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:41.120
[Guest 2]: So that is one opportunity for India, you know, to focus on attracting companies which are

02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:48.240
[Guest 2]: currently manufacturing in China. And to sort a lot of that, we need to actually get things

02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:54.480
[Guest 2]: all done well back home. So, for example, we need to get logistics right. We need to

02:22:54.480 --> 02:23:00.400
[Guest 2]: actually transition to a low import duty regime now because global firms, if they said shop here,

02:23:00.400 --> 02:23:04.720
[Guest 2]: they would still want to source things from various other parts. So we want to help them

02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:10.320
[Guest 2]: in that process. So there are a lot of these opportunities. If you want, we can discuss

02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:17.760
[Guest 2]: more about them. But it all depends on the things that India does domestically to be able to take

02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:24.960
[Guest 2]: opportunity of the fact that US and China will both be declined somewhat because of COVID-19.

02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:30.320
[Guest 1]: If I can add to that, I mean, yeah, a lot of what India's foreign policy and how India's

02:23:30.320 --> 02:23:36.800
[Guest 1]: stature globally, how we emerge out of all of this depends on how we manage the economic fallout and

02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:42.160
[Guest 1]: how quickly we recover and how well we recover. But from the point of view of, you know, what

02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:48.960
[Guest 1]: happens to the relationship with China, I mean, our view is that, look, there's going to be more

02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:53.280
[Guest 1]: of the same, more of the same dynamic that's going to play out that's existed. So there's

02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:59.840
[Guest 1]: no fundamental shifting of the dynamic that existed. The fact that China and the US are

02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:06.160
[Guest 1]: going to be at each other's throats without entering conflict creates opportunities for

02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:10.720
[Guest 1]: us, right? Because as a middle power, you can sort of bargain with both of them because, you know,

02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:17.840
[Guest 1]: both of them want you, to put it very crudely, in their camp. I mean, India is never going to be in

02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:22.880
[Guest 1]: China's camp, but at least the best that Beijing can hope for is that, you know, you're non-aligned

02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:29.520
[Guest 1]: in a more true sense of the phrase than, say, in the past. And that is what they would at least

02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:34.000
[Guest 1]: look for. And Beijing would also want stability. You don't necessarily want conflict because there's

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:38.960
[Guest 1]: lots of churn happening. So in that sense, there is an opportunity for India. But the flip side is

02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:45.280
[Guest 1]: that because Sino-US competition becomes far stronger and far deeper, there's a risk. And the

02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:51.280
[Guest 1]: risk is that China already is quite sensitive to sort of India's relationship with the US. So

02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:56.560
[Guest 1]: anytime sort of India even talks about the Indo-Pacific or freedom of navigation or anything

02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:01.120
[Guest 1]: like that, you see sort of a reaction from Beijing. Anytime you see something, you know,

02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:08.560
[Guest 1]: this talk of, you know, the Quad having a meeting or a particular joint maritime drill between

02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:13.440
[Guest 1]: India, the US, Japan and Australia, which has so far not happened. But anytime you have that sort

02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:19.280
[Guest 1]: of a conversation, you'll see a reaction from Beijing. And anytime you see India sort of

02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:23.120
[Guest 1]: drifting closer, you see some sort of tensions emerging. There's no direct sort of causation,

02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:28.320
[Guest 1]: but these sort of things happen, that you see tensions on the LAC, on the boundary with China.

02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:32.880
[Guest 1]: So my sense is that going forward, what you're going to see is that because this competition

02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:36.640
[Guest 1]: between China and the US becomes deeper and friction becomes far more intensified, you will

02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:43.040
[Guest 1]: end up seeing China becoming increasingly more sensitive to anything that India does. So just to

02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:48.800
[Guest 1]: sort of simple example, in the last 10 days, you've seen India impose some sort of restrictions

02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:53.200
[Guest 1]: on FDI essentially from China, although the notification talks about countries sharing

02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:57.840
[Guest 1]: land borders with India, but it's basically China. At the same time, you've seen a deal

02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:02.960
[Guest 1]: that's happened between Jio and Facebook. And that's sort of stuff that you will see. You saw

02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:08.880
[Guest 1]: the outrage in India over HDFC, sort of People's Bank of China's increase of stake in HDFC. Even

02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:14.240
[Guest 1]: that sort of a shift, how that gets perceived in Beijing would be largely in the context of,

02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:19.600
[Guest 1]: well, okay, India is picking sides. And the sensitivity to all that will increase. And

02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:25.040
[Guest 1]: that then creates volatility in that relationship. So that's how some bit of the geopolitics I sort

02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:31.280
[Amit Varma]: of see playing out going forward. And sort of leaving these major powers aside for a while,

02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:35.920
[Amit Varma]: which is the USA, the Middle Kingdom and the middle power, as you put it, how does one look at

02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:43.920
[Amit Varma]: those institutions, like the the United Nations and like WHO, those international institutions,

02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:50.080
[Amit Varma]: which sort of straddle geopolitical boundaries? How are they impacted? Is their influence and

02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:56.000
[Amit Varma]: credibility diminished by what has just happened? You know, how will that change going forward?

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:04.960
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I mean, on the UN side, already, the UN was a project which was quite on its death row,

02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:13.680
[Guest 2]: sort of so. And with this, and the whole role of World Health Organization and how it sort of

02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:20.480
[Guest 2]: played quite a disturbing role in all this in the initial phase has sort of taken the sheen of some

02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:26.800
[Guest 2]: of these multilateral organizations. But that does not mean that multilateral institutions will end.

02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:32.720
[Guest 2]: Probably what we might see is that we might see a new kind of multilateralism, which means that

02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:39.040
[Guest 2]: we won't have one global body, but we might have some multilateral institutions which are

02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:43.440
[Guest 2]: centered around China. And we might have some other multilateral institutions which continue

02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:50.320
[Guest 2]: to be centered around the US. So those sort of become the more important organizations for

02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:56.560
[Guest 2]: transnational cooperation, rather than one body like the UN and UN as a world government,

02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:01.920
[Guest 2]: all those ideas sort of go away when we are talking about so much of economic nationalism,

02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:06.400
[Guest 2]: and we are talking about a world in which labor mobility and all will decrease.

02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:12.320
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I think, so I agree with Pranay. I mean, I think, so John Mearsham sort of captures that

02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:16.640
[Guest 1]: when he says things like you're likely to see bounded orders, which are led by either the US,

02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:21.200
[Guest 1]: China or somebody else. So you'll see some of these other groupings. But at the same time,

02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:26.480
[Guest 1]: my sense is that you won't necessarily see, there are some challenges which even transcend some of

02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:33.440
[Guest 1]: these bounded orders. COVID is one such challenge. So is climate change. And I think you're going to

02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:39.360
[Guest 1]: see greater diversity. So you're going to see more of these multilateral organizations headed

02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:44.160
[Guest 1]: by certain, largely led by certain countries, but also you're going to see certain organizations

02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:50.000
[Guest 1]: which will require something greater than these bounded orders for people to work together on.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:56.160
[Guest 1]: I don't know how that plays out. But that's my sense that you will still, given the nature of

02:28:56.160 --> 02:29:03.840
[Guest 1]: this particular challenge, my hope is that states gradually sort of look past and say, okay, look,

02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:09.760
[Guest 1]: on the economy, I might need to have the circle of trust. And therefore that is bounded by certain

02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:15.040
[Guest 1]: things. So the WTO might not be as effective, as opposed to another sort of bounded institution,

02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:20.560
[Guest 1]: which has say, trust states that have greater trust among each other, or whether it's say the

02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:27.520
[Guest 1]: Western States, Western Europe, US, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand. But on climate

02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:31.440
[Guest 1]: change, I need something greater. So therefore, some of these broader institutions might actually

02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:38.160
[Guest 1]: survive and thrive, but their mandate might shift. Yeah, I actually think that action on climate

02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:44.000
[Guest 2]: change is going to slow down because of all this more friction. So collaboration on all this

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:51.760
[Guest 2]: building trust is going to become more difficult. So yeah, we require a transnational world

02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:55.360
[Guest 2]: cooperation on that front, but that becomes more difficult with what has happened.

02:29:56.080 --> 02:30:01.920
[Amit Varma]: Right. So my sort of final question to you, you guys is a two part question and perhaps

02:30:01.920 --> 02:30:06.560
[Amit Varma]: predictable, which is that, okay, right now, we are sort of in a fog of war in terms of

02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:12.560
[Amit Varma]: information, there is an epistemic fog, we don't really have a clear sense of what is happening,

02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:18.240
[Amit Varma]: what is happening, which strategy is best to deal with COVID-19, where different countries are

02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:22.960
[Amit Varma]: trying different levels of lockdowns or no lockdown, we don't know what the final impact will

02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:27.280
[Amit Varma]: be, we don't know the mortality rate, we don't know how widespread this will be and when we will

02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:32.640
[Amit Varma]: come out of it, right. So a lot of unknown unknowns ahead as well. So sort of looking to, you

02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:37.120
[Amit Varma]: know, as little as two years in the future, could you articulate what would be your worst case

02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:42.720
[Amit Varma]: scenario and your best case scenarios? And we can start with you, Pranay. Yeah, sort of the

02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:49.840
[Guest 2]: worst case scenario is that we actually end in this world where there is the global recession

02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:58.400
[Guest 2]: sort of continues for a long time. And because of that, you know, there is even more confrontation,

02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:05.360
[Guest 2]: there is less mobility, even COVID-19 sort of continues for a longer time. So that sort of

02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:13.200
[Guest 2]: blocks all our pathways to get back to any sense of normalcy. So that is sort of the worst scenario.

02:31:13.200 --> 02:31:20.080
[Guest 2]: And the accompanying thing would be India actually responds to all this by using more economic

02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:29.040
[Guest 2]: nationalism, by undergoing domestic strife, etc, right. So that is sort of the absolute worst case

02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:35.280
[Guest 2]: scenario that I can think. But the positive scenario would be that maybe we get over this,

02:31:36.160 --> 02:31:42.800
[Guest 2]: not a V-shaped recovery, but even if it is a delayed V-shaped recovery and India is able to

02:31:42.800 --> 02:31:49.440
[Guest 2]: use this opportunity, this moment to do some of the reforms, which it anyways had to do from a

02:31:49.440 --> 02:31:55.760
[Guest 2]: long time. So that might help. You know, so there is a very interesting concept on this called

02:31:55.760 --> 02:32:01.200
[Guest 2]: two level games, the idea being that this was a paper by Robert Putnam, which said that

02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:07.200
[Guest 2]: actually international negotiations don't happen at the level of two negotiators talking itself,

02:32:07.200 --> 02:32:12.400
[Guest 2]: but they also happen at two levels in the sense that the negotiator talks to the other country

02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:18.640
[Guest 2]: and the negotiator also has to talk to their domestic constituency, right. So now the fact

02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:23.920
[Guest 2]: that we had to do all these reforms on the economic side, some of them can't be done now,

02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:28.960
[Guest 2]: for example, the labor reforms can't be done, but land reforms can still be done in these

02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:35.760
[Guest 2]: situations. So we can use this level one situation, which is quite bad to sell the

02:32:35.760 --> 02:32:41.520
[Guest 2]: reforms at level two and to convince people, the domestic stakeholders, that if we don't get things

02:32:42.080 --> 02:32:47.440
[Guest 2]: right at this point of time, we are going to have a really tough time and there's no way out,

02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:53.440
[Guest 2]: right. So this is that moment. And if we are able to utilize that, we might see a more positive

02:32:53.440 --> 02:32:59.760
[Guest 1]: and stronger India coming out of it. From my point of view, the worst case scenario would be,

02:33:00.320 --> 02:33:06.000
[Guest 1]: you know, things open up and you have repeated and recurrent waves of infection, which,

02:33:06.800 --> 02:33:12.320
[Guest 1]: you know, completely stop any sort of social sort of society getting back together and

02:33:13.120 --> 02:33:17.680
[Guest 1]: that then eventually leads to greater, you know, reactionary tendencies among states

02:33:17.680 --> 02:33:22.720
[Guest 1]: within sort of countries. So for example, you see much more economic nationalism,

02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:28.720
[Guest 1]: you see something that's happened in Hungary, where essentially all individual rights,

02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:32.400
[Guest 1]: sort of, you know, systems, democratic systems get sort of completely undermined

02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:37.360
[Guest 1]: and you have dictatorships or you have at least so-called strongmen leaders even consolidating

02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:43.680
[Guest 1]: far greater power and checks and balances get eroded in the name of national sort of revival

02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:48.240
[Guest 1]: and that happening in different parts of the world, including in India. Another thing is that

02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:52.000
[Guest 1]: essentially when something like that happens, you end up seeing a complete erosion of this

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:59.040
[Guest 1]: concept of individual rights where states sort of continue to sort of overstretch into private lives.

02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:03.600
[Guest 1]: You see an erosion of privacy through technology interventions. At the moment, all of us are

02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:08.560
[Guest 1]: talking about the use of apps and things like that and the use of technology to do contact

02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:14.080
[Guest 1]: tracing, to track people and do all of that. But where does this leave the idea of privacy

02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:18.400
[Guest 1]: and individual privacy going forward? Do these sort of, how is this data stored and all of that?

02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:24.320
[Guest 1]: And all of those sorts of things continue to become the new normal for individuals and eventually

02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:28.880
[Guest 1]: sort of conflict, so conflict between states, conflict between the U.S. and China. At the moment,

02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:33.440
[Guest 1]: I mean, when you hear the narrative of somebody like Lindsey Graham in the U.S. saying things like

02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:40.000
[Guest 1]: China is responsible for 30-40,000 American deaths, directly responsible, and as that narrative sort

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:45.760
[Guest 1]: of takes hold, while, you know, there is better sense that exists at the moment, how things shape

02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:50.880
[Guest 1]: up, one doesn't know. So my sense would be that those would be my worst case outcomes.

02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:57.200
[Guest 1]: In terms of the best case outcomes, you know, part of it is nature. Hopefully, you know,

02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:04.080
[Guest 1]: we develop the kind of immunity that is needed. Hopefully, you know, the nature of the virus is

02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:08.320
[Guest 1]: actually not as bad. Data right now tells us that, you know, a large majority of cases are

02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:13.760
[Guest 1]: asymptomatic and they don't necessarily, you know, have any sort of adverse impacts on people.

02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:19.920
[Guest 1]: So actually, you know, the actual death toll and case load is not as bad. And people can get back

02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:24.240
[Guest 1]: to work as quickly as possible. Life can get back to some degree of normalcy as quickly as possible.

02:35:24.240 --> 02:35:28.880
[Guest 1]: We hopefully develop a vaccine within the next year. So people have been saying 12 to 18 months

02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:32.880
[Guest 1]: for now, three, four months. So hopefully, within the time frame, you actually get a vaccine and it

02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:38.240
[Guest 1]: can be administered mass-based. So things can get back to some degree of normalcy within a year and

02:35:38.240 --> 02:35:42.960
[Guest 1]: a half or so. And that, you know, the international order doesn't necessarily get as undermined. I

02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:49.200
[Guest 1]: mean, de-globalization, perhaps it will happen, but it happens in a sense that select sectors are

02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:54.960
[Guest 1]: seen as far more important from national security point of view. But otherwise, you have trade,

02:35:54.960 --> 02:36:00.400
[Guest 1]: which assumes, you know, those ideas of free trade don't necessarily go away. So that would be my

02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:05.600
[Guest 1]: first, that would be my best case scenario where at least things come back to somewhat normalcy.

02:36:05.600 --> 02:36:11.200
[Guest 1]: There's a new normal, but the new normal is not as bad as it can be. And the idea of international

02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:17.440
[Guest 1]: institutions still being needed and states still needing to work together sort of survives this

02:36:17.440 --> 02:36:22.480
[Amit Varma]: pandemic. On that hopeful note, thanks so much guys for joining me again. I mean, this of course

02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:28.400
[Amit Varma]: was remote and I hope at some point we can again sit in the same studio and record together. So

02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:42.240
[Amit Varma]: have a good lockdown. Thank you. Thanks Amit.
