00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Guest]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
[Amit Varma]: This, however, is only half the story.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
[Unknown]: politics and behavioral science.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is a brilliant historian,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
[Amit Varma]: Ira Mukherjee, and we'll be talking

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
[Amit Varma]: about her book, Daughters of the Sun,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Empresses, Queens and Begums of the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Mughal Empire, which was an

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
[Amit Varma]: eye-opening read for me, demolishing

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
[Amit Varma]: all my notions of what women of the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Mughal era would have been like, with their

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
[Amit Varma]: opulence and their harems and their

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
[Amit Varma]: subservience to all-powerful emperors.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
[Amit Varma]: On the contrary, I discovered a complex

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
[Amit Varma]: world in which women were major players,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
[Amit Varma]: jostling for power, shaping

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
[Amit Varma]: major events, and many in ways that

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
[Amit Varma]: would be invisible to foreign

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
[Amit Varma]: historians or even male historians

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
[Amit Varma]: from India. Ira's previous

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
[Amit Varma]: book, Heroines, was

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
[Amit Varma]: also about powerful women either

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
[Amit Varma]: forgotten or reshaped by historians.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
[Amit Varma]: But it's Daughters of the Sun

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
[Amit Varma]: and its remarkable Mughal women that

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
[Amit Varma]: we'll be focusing on today, after

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
[Amit Varma]: a quick commercial break.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Hey, I want to thank Intel

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
[Amit Varma]: for supporting The Seen and the Unseen.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
[Amit Varma]: If you haven't already, I recommend you

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
[Amit Varma]: check out Intel vPro. Intel

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
[Amit Varma]: vPro is a business platform that maximizes

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
[Amit Varma]: the performance of your company's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
[Amit Varma]: computers. One of the ways in which it

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
[Amit Varma]: does this is by maximizing stability

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
[Amit Varma]: through the Intel Stable Image

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Platform Program, or SIPP.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, I get pretty upset when

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
[Amit Varma]: some software that was working perfectly

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
[Amit Varma]: well starts acting up because

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
[Amit Varma]: an update went wrong somewhere. The SIPP,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
[Amit Varma]: the Intel Stable Image

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
[Amit Varma]: Platform Program, avoids

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
[Amit Varma]: this by ensuring stability of your

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
[Amit Varma]: infrastructure. A minimum number of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
[Amit Varma]: software or hardware updates and predictable

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
[Amit Varma]: transitions from one generation

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
[Amit Varma]: of technology to the next.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
[Amit Varma]: Your moody machine ain't gonna hang on

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
[Amit Varma]: you no more. For more details,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
[Amit Varma]: head on over to Intel.in

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
[Amit Varma]: slash vPro. That's V-P-R-O.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
[Amit Varma]: Intel.in slash vPro

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
[Amit Varma]: because stability is everything.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Ira, welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for having me here. Ira, tell me

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
[Amit Varma]: a little bit about yourself. How did you, sort of,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
[Amit Varma]: where did you study? What did you do?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
[Amit Varma]: How did you get to where you are?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
[Guest]: So, I'm a little bit of an

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
[Guest]: accidental writer of history

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
[Guest]: because I'm not an historian.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
[Guest]: I'm actually a

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
[Guest]: scientist by training, all those

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
[Guest]: many years ago. And it was just

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
[Guest]: something that, you know, I did

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
[Guest]: because in those days, when

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
[Guest]: you were a capable student, you were kind of

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
[Guest]: and you were alright in the sciences, you were

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
[Guest]: pushed towards that. And literature,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
[Guest]: which I was also interested in, was not

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
[Guest]: considered a suitable or serious

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
[Guest]: enough career option.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
[Guest]: So I did sciences, I did it for quite a while

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
[Guest]: and then it just so happened that

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
[Guest]: nothing in it really interested me as a career

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
[Guest]: to continue in. And then

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
[Guest]: as is the case, I think,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
[Guest]: for many women, especially, and

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
[Guest]: especially of my generation,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
[Guest]: things took maybe a backseat

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
[Guest]: and other things take over. Your life, you know,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
[Guest]: family responsibilities and

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
[Guest]: just other things that you have to do.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
[Guest]: And I didn't work for a while.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
[Guest]: And then when my children were born and they were

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
[Guest]: slowly growing up, I had this idea of

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
[Guest]: getting back to literature because I had always really loved

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
[Guest]: writing. So I wrote a

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
[Guest]: manuscript, which was

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
[Guest]: on mythology. And I

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
[Guest]: approached a publisher who was at that time more

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
[Guest]: interested in writing history. So though he liked

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
[Guest]: my writing a lot, he

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
[Guest]: suggested that I write a book on history.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
[Guest]: And that is completely

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
[Guest]: how it happened, completely accidentally.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
[Guest]: And I found out that it was something that

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
[Guest]: I enjoyed doing. And strangely

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
[Guest]: enough, it's something in which I can use

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
[Guest]: both my skills, my scientific

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
[Guest]: background, because it requires a lot of research,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
[Guest]: being extremely thorough

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
[Guest]: with things like sources and understanding

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
[Guest]: primary material, and as well

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
[Guest]: as my writing skills and, you know,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
[Guest]: my fondness for literature. So the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
[Guest]: writing of history or narrative history became

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
[Guest]: something that I was very

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
[Guest]: lucky enough to find that I could

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
[Guest]: combine the skills that I had and do

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
[Guest]: something which was so amazingly

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
[Amit Varma]: rewarding for me. And did you also read history

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
[Amit Varma]: at this time? At the time of

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
[Amit Varma]: starting to write, do you mean? Yeah, I mean,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
[Guest]: did you read history for leisure also? I

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
[Guest]: wasn't reading history for

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
[Guest]: leisure per se before I started

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
[Guest]: writing about it, though I was

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
[Guest]: reading around it. You know,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
[Guest]: I suppose what happened

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
[Guest]: is that as you, you know,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
[Guest]: grow up in life, as you go through various

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
[Guest]: changes and various phases

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
[Guest]: of your life, you get interested in various

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
[Guest]: things. So, you know, initially

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
[Guest]: perhaps I would view things

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
[Guest]: as a young woman, and then as a young

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
[Guest]: woman out in the world, and then maybe

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
[Guest]: as a young Asian woman, you know.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
[Guest]: And then things change, and I saw things

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
[Guest]: as a parent, and then as a parent of

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
[Guest]: young girls. And so at each

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
[Guest]: stage of my life, I was interested in different

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
[Guest]: readings. And so one of the things

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
[Guest]: that I started to get interested in, before history

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
[Guest]: even, was the way in

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
[Guest]: which we have been colonized in

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
[Guest]: our imagination, in the way we view the

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
[Guest]: world, in our memories even,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
[Guest]: you know, to the extent where many of

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
[Guest]: my memories, like the way I grew up reading

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
[Guest]: things like Enid Blyton,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
[Guest]: my memories and my nostalgia were

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
[Guest]: for things that I had no physical

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
[Guest]: experience of. So whether it was

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
[Guest]: for soft summer sunshine, or cucumber

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
[Guest]: sandwiches, or Wordsworth's

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
[Guest]: poetry, which I could quote, but I couldn't

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
[Guest]: quote Mir or Ghalib, you know.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
[Guest]: So these were things that started

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
[Guest]: bothering me, and things that I started thinking

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
[Guest]: about. You know, I read Pankaj Mishra,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
[Guest]: Roy Moxton,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
[Guest]: The Theft of India, various things around these

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
[Guest]: issues. And that was something

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
[Guest]: which was in my background as I

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
[Guest]: started to think about writing

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
[Amit Varma]: about history. And who

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
[Amit Varma]: are the sort of thinkers who

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
[Amit Varma]: have been a big influence on you? Like one question

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
[Amit Varma]: I sometimes ask my guests is

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
[Amit Varma]: if they can name books which change the way

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
[Amit Varma]: they look at the world. And not necessarily specific

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
[Amit Varma]: books, but even thinkers, or

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
[Guest]: you know. Well, I would say

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
[Guest]: there has been a three-fold

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
[Guest]: sort of influence on me. So on

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
[Guest]: the one hand, there are

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
[Guest]: as I was saying, the writers who have pointed

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
[Guest]: out the

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
[Guest]: colonization of our history.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
[Guest]: So people like Pankaj Mishra and many others, you know,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
[Guest]: even Naipaul, the way he talks about identity,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
[Guest]: and the way he talks about Indianness

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
[Guest]: outside India,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
[Guest]: rootlessness. These are all things, people who

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
[Guest]: have had an influence on me.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
[Guest]: And then the second sort of phase

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
[Guest]: of influence has been the women

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
[Guest]: writers, the women who talk about gender.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
[Guest]: So whether it's Ira Vethikarve

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
[Guest]: and Uganta, you know, I found her

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
[Guest]: essays startling about the way in which she

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
[Guest]: writes about women of the Mahabharata.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
[Guest]: And one writer who has

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
[Guest]: been extremely influential for

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
[Guest]: me has been Dr. Rubilal,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
[Guest]: who is, she defines herself as a

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
[Guest]: feminist historian. She's a

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
[Guest]: professor and a writer of history. She's written

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
[Guest]: about Noor Jahan, but her

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
[Guest]: most groundbreaking book was about

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
[Guest]: the early Mughal harem,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
[Guest]: domesticity and power.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
[Guest]: And so she, for the first time I came across

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
[Guest]: a woman scholar who was

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
[Guest]: writing about the way in which

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
[Guest]: the harem existed

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
[Guest]: in a completely different way in which

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
[Guest]: I had thought about it. So her

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
[Guest]: writing for me was extremely important.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
[Guest]: I have based a lot of my writing on

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
[Guest]: what she has already discovered.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
[Guest]: And there's also

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
[Guest]: people like Chimamanda Adichie,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
[Guest]: at a different level, the way she talks about

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
[Guest]: the importance of a single

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
[Guest]: narrative, how that can be so harmful

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
[Guest]: for us if we see the world

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
[Guest]: and our past and our present

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
[Guest]: through only one filter.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
[Guest]: So these are some of the people. And then

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
[Guest]: the very third and last aspect, which

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
[Guest]: was useful for me, is stylistic.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
[Guest]: Now we often don't talk about that

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
[Guest]: very much because I suppose writing of

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
[Guest]: history, the material itself is so

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
[Guest]: interesting that people mostly ask

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
[Guest]: me about the material itself, but stylistically

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
[Guest]: speaking, people who have been influential

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
[Guest]: are people like Hilary Mantel, even though she writes

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
[Guest]: fiction, fictionalized

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
[Guest]: history, but still, her style is

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
[Guest]: so arresting that when I read Wolf Hall

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
[Guest]: and her trilogy, I thought

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
[Guest]: this is the way I want to write history for

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
[Guest]: India as well. I want people to

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
[Guest]: feel like they have been caught by the scruff

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
[Guest]: of the neck and thrown into that century,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
[Guest]: whichever century I'm writing about, and to

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
[Guest]: feel the reality of it, the geographical

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
[Guest]: reality, the noises, the smells, everything

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
[Guest]: in three dimensions. So these

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
[Guest]: are some of the influences that have

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
[Amit Varma]: shaped my writing. And one of the things

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
[Amit Varma]: I've sort of realized in the last few years,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
[Amit Varma]: thanks partly to writers like you, is that

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
[Amit Varma]: so much of history

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
[Amit Varma]: has been captive to and

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
[Amit Varma]: colonized by the male gaze,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
[Amit Varma]: which is, you know, the history of humanity

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
[Amit Varma]: has been treated as a history of men who are

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
[Amit Varma]: going out and doing big things,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
[Amit Varma]: invading kingdoms and they're

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
[Amit Varma]: setting up dynasties and all of that,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
[Amit Varma]: and also they've been looked at,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
[Amit Varma]: most of this history has been

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
[Amit Varma]: written by male historians, and that's

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
[Amit Varma]: the perspective you see, and the women are largely

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
[Amit Varma]: invisible. And is that something

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
[Amit Varma]: which sort of influenced,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
[Amit Varma]: because you were already thinking

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
[Amit Varma]: about these issues, like you mentioned,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
[Amit Varma]: is that something that influenced

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
[Amit Varma]: what you chose your subject

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
[Guest]: to be when you actually started writing history?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
[Guest]: Yes, yes, definitely. You know,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
[Guest]: I read a

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
[Guest]: statistic which said that

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
[Guest]: 99.5% of the

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
[Guest]: written history that we see around us,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
[Guest]: starting from 5000 BC

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
[Guest]: onwards, you know, whatever there is,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
[Guest]: the sculptures, the writing,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
[Guest]: the calligraphy, everything,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
[Guest]: 99.5% deals with men,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
[Guest]: and 0.5% tells the

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
[Guest]: stories of women. So that statistic

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
[Guest]: sort of stopped me in my tracks. It was a very

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
[Guest]: startling statistic. And when I

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
[Guest]: stopped to think about what I knew about women's

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
[Guest]: history, I think that's very true.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
[Guest]: So it definitely,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
[Guest]: starting from the fact that I have

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
[Guest]: two, as I said, two daughters,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
[Guest]: I wanted them to see the

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
[Guest]: world around them in a less biased way,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
[Guest]: that history need not

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
[Guest]: necessarily be about the fighting of

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
[Guest]: battles, about the conquest of territories,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
[Guest]: and there are many, many other aspects

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
[Guest]: that form a civilization, maybe

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
[Guest]: so-called soft power, you know,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
[Guest]: the music, the creation of music, the creation

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
[Guest]: of art, architecture, politics,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
[Guest]: behind the scenes, who controls things,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
[Guest]: sexual politics, these are all

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
[Guest]: things that contribute to a culture.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
[Guest]: And very often, women are absolutely

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
[Guest]: instrumental in that aspect of it.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
[Guest]: So for 100%, this was something that

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
[Guest]: I thought that whatever I write,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
[Guest]: even if it's the history of a man, or

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
[Guest]: you know, whichever aspect I'm going to cover,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
[Guest]: I'm going to bring in all the women involved,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
[Guest]: because they really tend to be written out

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
[Guest]: of the stories of men,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
[Guest]: and history ends up being the story of men told

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
[Amit Varma]: by men.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
[Amit Varma]: And how difficult

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
[Amit Varma]: is it then to

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
[Amit Varma]: start researching into that kind of history, because

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
[Amit Varma]: most history is written by male historians

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
[Amit Varma]: who tend to, you know,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
[Amit Varma]: whitewash the women or recast them in

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
[Amit Varma]: acceptable ways, and so, I mean, this is

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
[Amit Varma]: really a dual question, in the sense

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
[Unknown]: as someone who's not a trained historian,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
[Amit Varma]: how, what is it like to do

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
[Amit Varma]: history? How did you learn that?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And also then going beyond that,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
[Amit Varma]: what do you do about this essential limitation

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
[Amit Varma]: that you are broadening the gaze

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
[Amit Varma]: by which you're looking at history, but

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
[Guest]: the voices don't have that same gaze?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
[Guest]: That's right. To answer the first part

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
[Guest]: of your question, I think

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
[Guest]: the way you can teach yourself history is go to

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
[Guest]: the primary sources, you know, that's the most

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
[Guest]: important aspect

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
[Guest]: of writing history.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
[Guest]: And there is a lot of primary sources,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
[Guest]: even, of course, much less

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
[Guest]: where women are concerned, so I always make an

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
[Guest]: effort to find the women's

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
[Guest]: voices. So, for example, in one of, in my first

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
[Guest]: book, I've written the story of

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
[Guest]: Amrapali, who was a Buddhist nun at the time

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
[Guest]: of the Buddha, 6th century BCE.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
[Guest]: And you would think, okay, there's nothing

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
[Guest]: written about women in the 6th century BCE,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
[Guest]: but luckily there is, because she lived

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
[Guest]: at the time of the Buddha, and

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
[Guest]: the Buddhist monks were one of the

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
[Guest]: first great writers

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
[Guest]: of history, you know, and they wrote everything

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
[Guest]: around the Buddha. And so we have the story

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
[Guest]: of the nuns, and their poems,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
[Guest]: they wrote poetry, and very luckily for us,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
[Guest]: we have the voice of this woman from 2000

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
[Guest]: years ago, even today.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
[Guest]: Her story, her longings,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
[Guest]: her desires, the way she talks

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
[Guest]: about the evanescence of her beauty,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
[Guest]: how it has faded, and this is so poignant

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
[Guest]: to us even today. So, there are

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
[Guest]: ways women's voices are there,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
[Guest]: it just takes a little bit more effort,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
[Guest]: a little bit more diligence and searching

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
[Guest]: to get to them. Like, for example,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
[Guest]: if we have Lakshmibai, the story

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
[Guest]: of Lakshmibai has been written by many different

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
[Guest]: men.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
[Guest]: And you have the Europeans who are

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
[Guest]: writing about her, and they're writing from their point

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
[Guest]: of view, with their European gaze,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
[Guest]: so they talk about her as being like an

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
[Guest]: Amazon, and immediately there as well,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
[Guest]: there's a texturing of Rani Lakshmibai,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
[Guest]: which is very different from when

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
[Guest]: a Brahmin writes about her,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
[Guest]: and writes about her as this great

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
[Guest]: widow, this great, you know, almost

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
[Guest]: a holy woman, Mother India. So you have

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
[Guest]: Mother India on one side, the Amazon woman

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
[Guest]: on the other side. You see some men look

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
[Guest]: at the same, very same woman, in many

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
[Guest]: different ways. And then it is my

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
[Guest]: job to sort of see the intersection

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
[Guest]: of these many gazes, and to see

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
[Guest]: where does the humanity

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
[Guest]: of this woman lie. What made

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
[Guest]: her an Amazon? Her fearlessness,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
[Guest]: her amazing bravery, yes.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
[Guest]: What made her Mother India? The fact that

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
[Guest]: she adopted this child, but also

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
[Guest]: the fact that she nurtured her city.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
[Guest]: And for me, that is the crux of this woman.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
[Guest]: This nurturing aspect of her.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
[Guest]: That she didn't want to die in battle.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
[Guest]: We are always told, you know, Lakshmibai, Khob Ladi

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
[Guest]: Madani, you know, that is the line we remember.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
[Guest]: But what makes her a heroine for me

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
[Guest]: is the fact that she wanted to live,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
[Guest]: and she wanted her people to live,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
[Guest]: and she fought very hard for her right

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
[Guest]: to rule her people, and for them to be

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
[Guest]: safe under her care. She eventually

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
[Guest]: lost, and she died in battle. But

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
[Guest]: these are the aspects of women's stories

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
[Guest]: that I want to bring up. Not necessarily the dying

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
[Guest]: in battle, which is, at the end of the

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
[Guest]: day, a very male way of showing heroism.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
[Guest]: But there is a different way of being heroic,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
[Guest]: and that is something that I wanted to

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
[Guest]: look at in my first book.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
[Guest]: So those stories are

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
[Guest]: there, that literature is there.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
[Guest]: It takes maybe a different gaze,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
[Guest]: a different interpretation to get at it.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And one of the interesting things

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned in Heroines,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
[Amit Varma]: we'll talk more about Daughters of the Sun today, but

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
[Amit Varma]: I found Heroines very interesting, and

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
[Amit Varma]: in fact, it actually reminded me

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
[Amit Varma]: of Yogantha, which is why I brought it up

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
[Amit Varma]: in our conversation earlier, and I mean that entirely

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
[Amit Varma]: as a compliment, because I think Yogantha is a masterpiece.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
[Amit Varma]: And one of the interesting things you said

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
[Amit Varma]: at the start of Heroines is

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
[Amit Varma]: you spoke about how

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
[Amit Varma]: there is this sort of interplay

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
[Amit Varma]: between history and myth,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
[Amit Varma]: and how a lot of women in history

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
[Amit Varma]: are recast in convenient

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
[Amit Varma]: ways that are palatable to men,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
[Amit Varma]: like what you just described about

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Lakshmibai, and often they're almost sanitized

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
[Amit Varma]: and they're made to fit into these roles.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
[Amit Varma]: And equally,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
[Amit Varma]: how myths can also, you know,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
[Amit Varma]: the same sort of interplay works the

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
[Amit Varma]: other way, and I was very fascinated by

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
[Amit Varma]: the chapter on Draupadi in that,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
[Amit Varma]: because what we find

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
[Amit Varma]: with many of our myths is

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
[Amit Varma]: that those myths are shaped

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
[Amit Varma]: to fit social norms. So you look at someone like

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Sita, she is the ideal Hindu

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
[Amit Varma]: woman in terms of being pativrata,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
[Amit Varma]: being devoted to her husband,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
[Amit Varma]: virtuous, and so on and so forth.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
[Amit Varma]: But Draupadi is like this

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
[Amit Varma]: incredibly feisty character who just

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
[Amit Varma]: goes against everything you would think

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
[Amit Varma]: of as, you know, the ideal Hindu

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
[Amit Varma]: nari. And

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, why do you think Draupadi was even

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
[Guest]: conceived and imagined?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
[Guest]: Draupadi is

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
[Guest]: one of my all-time favorite characters,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
[Guest]: I have to say, because she's in a way the antithesis

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
[Guest]: of Sita, you know. What I love

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
[Guest]: about her is her fierce

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
[Guest]: erudition and her

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
[Guest]: outspokenness and her anger.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
[Guest]: Now, you know, anger is something that we don't

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
[Guest]: see encouraged in Indian women. You know,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
[Guest]: Indian women are encouraged to be quieter, to keep

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
[Guest]: their anger internalized. And in a way,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
[Guest]: Sita, I feel, internalized her feelings,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
[Guest]: her anger, and she combusts

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
[Guest]: in a way. You know, she dies, she commits suicide.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
[Guest]: Draupadi doesn't do that.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
[Guest]: She externalizes her anger.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
[Guest]: In fact, she carries it on her own body

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
[Guest]: by keeping her hair loose for those 12 years

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
[Guest]: in exile, you know, and said,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
[Guest]: I will not tie up my hair till it is drenched in blood,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
[Guest]: in the blood of my enemy. So I find this

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
[Guest]: a very powerful thing that she

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
[Guest]: has said, which is why I start my book with Draupadi,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
[Guest]: because I want today's women to remember

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
[Guest]: this for their daughters and

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
[Guest]: for themselves. You know, we call our daughters Sita,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
[Guest]: we never call them Draupadi. Why is that?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
[Guest]: You know, I really want to challenge that and say,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
[Guest]: let's go back. So people have imagined

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
[Guest]: this woman all these thousands of years

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
[Guest]: ago. As you say, why did

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
[Guest]: this happen and how did it happen?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
[Guest]: How did it happen that she was allowed to say these

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
[Guest]: things, right? She even challenges Yudhishthira

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
[Guest]: oftentimes. She calls him

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
[Guest]: less than a man, almost a eunuch for not

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
[Guest]: standing up for her, for not fighting for her.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
[Guest]: She says some very damaging things

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
[Guest]: for, you know, as a queen to her husband.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
[Guest]: But she's allowed to say this.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
[Guest]: So what is it

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
[Guest]: in our time in the past

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
[Guest]: that women were given this voice, this agency,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
[Guest]: and in fact, such a powerful

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
[Guest]: woman who is, they say, the cause of the

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
[Guest]: war itself and who brings about, you know,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
[Guest]: the end of that era. What is

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
[Guest]: it that allowed this woman to be the way

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
[Guest]: she is, that society accepted

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
[Guest]: her and loved her in her own time

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
[Guest]: as this woman? But if you, you know,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
[Guest]: when I explain it in my chapter, through the years,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
[Guest]: through the centuries, she has been sanitized

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
[Guest]: progressively.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
[Guest]: So that in the end, finally, she is almost

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
[Guest]: a Sita-like character. If you look at,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
[Guest]: you know, the actors who are playing her today on

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
[Guest]: television, they are the same

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
[Guest]: fair-skinned, you know,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
[Guest]: patirat women, clearly

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
[Guest]: upper-caste, brahminical, you know,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
[Guest]: part of the patriarchy, very much in,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
[Guest]: you know, part of the system.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
[Guest]: So why has that happened? Why are we

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
[Guest]: today almost more regressive

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
[Guest]: and having to make our women conform

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
[Guest]: to certain standards, to

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
[Guest]: shut down their anger, to stamp

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
[Guest]: down their voices? What is it that in us

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
[Guest]: as a society, that so many thousands

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
[Guest]: of years ago, this woman was allowed

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
[Guest]: to be angry, to be fierce

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
[Guest]: and to question the men in her life,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
[Guest]: whereas today, she has been sanitized

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
[Guest]: to such an extent that she is almost

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
[Guest]: indistinguishable. So often when I

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
[Guest]: talk about heroines, I show a slide

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
[Guest]: which shows the eight women

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
[Guest]: as they are portrayed in popular culture today

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
[Guest]: and there's hardly any difference between them.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
[Guest]: They're all the same, very fair-skinned

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
[Guest]: with their, you know, full jewellery.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
[Guest]: And the jewellery is a symbol in Indian society

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
[Guest]: of marriage status, which means that your sexuality

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
[Guest]: is allowed only within

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
[Guest]: this sanctified arena of marriage.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
[Guest]: You know, and the aim is to procreate,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
[Guest]: to have children. Why is it

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
[Guest]: that all these women must

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
[Guest]: conform to this standard, whereas earlier

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
[Guest]: on in their own times, whether it's 2000 years

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
[Guest]: ago, 500 years ago, you know, Mirabai,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
[Guest]: etc., they were allowed to have

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
[Guest]: agency, they were allowed to have

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
[Guest]: freedom of expression. Mirabai too

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
[Guest]: said some very shocking things. If we look

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
[Guest]: at her padas today, she says

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
[Guest]: things like, this

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
[Guest]: habit that we have, I'm just paraphrasing,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
[Guest]: but this habit that we have of sending

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
[Guest]: young women away to get

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
[Guest]: married and severe all connection

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
[Guest]: with their natal homes, so that there's

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
[Guest]: no support structure for them. She questions

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
[Guest]: this. She says, why do we do this? Why do

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
[Guest]: we send young girls so far away?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
[Guest]: Why are they abused by their in-laws? Why do

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
[Guest]: we allow this to happen? These are such

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
[Guest]: powerful things for women to say.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
[Guest]: And yet, with time, what happened

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
[Guest]: to Mirabai was, it was, slowly

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
[Guest]: her story was altered, so that she

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
[Guest]: became this married woman who

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
[Guest]: waited conveniently and

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
[Guest]: quietly, submissively for her husband to die.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
[Guest]: Then once he died, she stepped

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
[Guest]: out of the house as a good widow, and

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
[Guest]: she was allowed to go and sing her songs. Whereas

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
[Guest]: that is probably not what happened. She probably

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
[Guest]: left home because she was fed up of being

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
[Guest]: abused by her in-laws and by her husband.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
[Guest]: She left her husband as a married

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
[Guest]: woman, and as a single married woman

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
[Guest]: she was alone on the roads,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
[Guest]: accompanied by other singers, other devotees,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
[Guest]: by men and women. So she was

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
[Guest]: in a sexually vulnerable position.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
[Guest]: And yet, she went out and she sang

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
[Guest]: these amazing songs, which

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
[Guest]: I think, the single most

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
[Guest]: recognizable

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
[Guest]: figure, maybe the female figure, is Mirabai.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
[Guest]: Everybody knows her songs. So she

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
[Guest]: tapped into a certain longing in

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
[Guest]: people, unlike anybody else

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
[Guest]: before, you know. But yet

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
[Guest]: today, all these 100-500 years later,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
[Guest]: we have made her into this very

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
[Guest]: sanitized figure. And if you ask Rajput ladies

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
[Guest]: today, they will say, yes, Mirabai is a wonderful

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
[Guest]: heroine, but we will not encourage

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
[Guest]: her behavior in our daughters. Again,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
[Guest]: this difference between what we will

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
[Guest]: allow our daughters today, and

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
[Guest]: what the figures have stood for in the past.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
[Guest]: So this is something that I want people to

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
[Guest]: think about, that why is it? Why has

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
[Guest]: that happened? And what can we do?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
[Guest]: Can we look back upon these women as

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
[Guest]: heroic figures for daughters today?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
[Guest]: For young women in India today?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
[Guest]: You know, let us challenge this

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
[Guest]: very fair

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
[Guest]: and sanitized vision that we are being

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
[Guest]: offered time and again, and it sort of force-fed

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
[Guest]: these women's images. Let us challenge that

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
[Guest]: and look back to what we have in our

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
[Guest]: culture. Sometimes I'm told, oh,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
[Guest]: feminism is a Western construct.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
[Guest]: It is not. We have had women who are

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
[Guest]: fiercely feminists, you know, from Gargi

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
[Guest]: onwards, who have spoken their mind.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
[Guest]: So our society has accepted

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
[Guest]: and fostered this spirit. Why has it

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
[Guest]: gone? So these are some of the thoughts that I

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
[Guest]: want people to have and to think about.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
[Amit Varma]: That's a great insight. In fact, I have a

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
[Amit Varma]: couple of digressions, and you know, what you said

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
[Amit Varma]: about what Mirabai said, that why are women

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
[Amit Varma]: sent away to their husbands without anything, blah, blah,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
[Amit Varma]: reminds me of a recent episode

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
[Amit Varma]: I did with the economic

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
[Unknown]: historian Chinmay Tumbe, who wrote a book

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
[Unknown]: called India Moving on Migration.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And one of the points he made, and to my

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
[Amit Varma]: shame, this point had never struck me,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
[Amit Varma]: is that a very large

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
[Amit Varma]: part of migration is simply

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
[Amit Varma]: women getting married and going.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
[Amit Varma]: And we don't think of that. We think of migration as men

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
[Amit Varma]: going, or families going, or whatever, but

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
[Guest]: so much of migration is women getting married and going.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
[Amit Varma]: That's right, yes. And the other thought

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
[Amit Varma]: that sort of struck me was, I'd also done an episode

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
[Amit Varma]: with Tony Joseph, who's written a book

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Early Indians, and one of the points he made

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
[Amit Varma]: in that was that they were, you know,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
[Amit Varma]: a couple of millennia ago, you had

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
[Amit Varma]: competing strands within Hinduism,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
[Amit Varma]: and they were different, and they were competing,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
[Amit Varma]: and not all of them

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
[Amit Varma]: were this particular fixed strand

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
[Amit Varma]: which looks at a woman in a particular way

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
[Amit Varma]: like we look at Sita today.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
[Amit Varma]: And it just so happens that one of those

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
[Amit Varma]: strands kind of won out, and it was a

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
[Amit Varma]: political victory, and that strand then dominated

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
[Amit Varma]: our culture, and all of these women

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
[Amit Varma]: and now this is me speaking,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of got, you know, recast

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
[Amit Varma]: into it. But the fact

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
[Guest]: is that these strands were there. Yes.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
[Guest]: Absolutely. And

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
[Guest]: to come to your first point,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
[Guest]: this whole point

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
[Guest]: about the alienation of women from their natal

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
[Guest]: homes, it's something which we have exoticized

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
[Guest]: and wrongly so. You know, this

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
[Guest]: whole bidai genre which has come up,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
[Guest]: which talks about the saying

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
[Guest]: goodbye to the bride,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
[Guest]: it's a terrible thing. We, you know, we must

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
[Guest]: not exoticize it. It is a terrible thing to cut

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
[Guest]: off a young woman from her

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
[Guest]: family, from her mother, from her

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
[Guest]: natal family, from the support of her brothers, her sisters,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
[Guest]: everything she has known. She's thrown

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
[Guest]: into a new place where she's automatically

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
[Guest]: a second citizen because she doesn't know anything

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
[Guest]: about that new household.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
[Guest]: So this is something that

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
[Guest]: has been, you know, very much praised

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
[Guest]: in folk literature,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
[Guest]: and Mirabai challenges that, and so it is

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
[Guest]: something very refreshing. When I read that, I said,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
[Guest]: yes, this is something, today I can

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
[Guest]: absolutely understand what she's saying

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
[Guest]: and I would say the same thing for my daughters. I would

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
[Guest]: not want them to be cut off from their families,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
[Guest]: you know. So this is an

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
[Guest]: interesting point that women were always,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
[Guest]: endogamy has been practiced for so long,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
[Guest]: sending women upwards and onwards and

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
[Guest]: away from their family, which was in effect

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
[Guest]: in a way almost castrating them

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
[Guest]: because then they have no power to fall back on, right?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
[Guest]: So they have to do what they must do in their

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
[Guest]: in-laws' family. And

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
[Guest]: the second point about them, there have been many

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
[Guest]: different strands, and it is a point that I make

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
[Guest]: as well, is that there are very

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
[Guest]: many different ways of being

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
[Guest]: feminine, of being a woman, and being a

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
[Guest]: heroic woman in India. What does it mean to be

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
[Guest]: a heroic woman, right? There are many

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
[Guest]: many different ways of doing that, and

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
[Guest]: every woman in the book that I have written

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
[Guest]: does it in a different way, whether it is

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
[Guest]: through her music, whether it is

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
[Guest]: in a more manly way, in quotes,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
[Guest]: on the battlefield, whether it is

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
[Guest]: you know, leading men

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
[Guest]: in battle, or whether it is just

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
[Guest]: shaping society around her

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
[Guest]: in whatever way she can. These

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
[Guest]: are all heroic ways, and these were

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
[Guest]: very accepted ways, and there was no one

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
[Guest]: single way. When I came across these, you know,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
[Guest]: the writings on these women, they were never

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
[Guest]: criticized and told, it would be better

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
[Guest]: for you to be this other way, you know,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
[Guest]: rather than being the way you are. They were allowed to be

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
[Guest]: that different way, and it is only in more recent

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
[Guest]: times, I think, that we have

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
[Guest]: drawn these strictures around these women and

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
[Amit Varma]: wanted them to be a certain way.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
[Amit Varma]: And what both your books also demonstrate is that

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
[Amit Varma]: that heroism is something that you

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
[Amit Varma]: have to look in the context of each individual

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, what are the restraints

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
[Amit Varma]: on them and so on. And we often

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
[Amit Varma]: tend to think of heroism as

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
[Amit Varma]: just marching out to battle holding a sword,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
[Amit Varma]: which is why, you know, the point you made earlier about Lakshmi Bai

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
[Unknown]: and, you know, that's a typical

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
[Amit Varma]: image of her, and heroism

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
[Amit Varma]: amounts to a lot more than that.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on to your second book now,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, where did, given

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
[Amit Varma]: that everything that I had read

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
[Amit Varma]: of Mughal history before this,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
[Amit Varma]: most of it was centered around these men

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
[Amit Varma]: and there was this notion that women

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
[Amit Varma]: are just, you know, stuck in their imperial

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
[Amit Varma]: harems or desirannas or whatever and they're not important

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
[Amit Varma]: characters. What brought you

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
[Amit Varma]: to the notion of writing this book? When did you

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
[Amit Varma]: realize that this material is really

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
[Guest]: rich and someone needs to tell this story?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
[Guest]: I think it was, you know, when I wrote Heroines,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
[Guest]: one of the heroines that I write about

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
[Guest]: is Jahanara Begum.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
[Guest]: And it was when I found out how much

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
[Guest]: she had done, you know, and her accomplishments,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
[Guest]: it was a very visceral

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
[Guest]: and personal reaction that I had

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
[Guest]: because I'm a Delhi woman, I was brought up in Delhi.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
[Guest]: Jahanara is a Delhi woman

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
[Guest]: to the extent that she has created great

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
[Guest]: extents of old Delhi, and yet

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
[Guest]: growing up, I was never taught about her.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
[Guest]: So I had this sort of visceral

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
[Guest]: reaction to this, a sort of anger

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
[Guest]: and a sort of, you know,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
[Guest]: feeling that enough is enough

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
[Guest]: and what lies

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
[Guest]: behind all these stories that we have not been

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
[Guest]: told? So there was this questioning

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
[Guest]: of the given sort of history

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
[Guest]: that had been taught, Mughal history,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
[Guest]: in very bullet form, you know, in a very dry

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
[Guest]: way, and about the men, because they have

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
[Guest]: been amazing Mughal men, definitely.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
[Guest]: But where are the women

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
[Guest]: and why were they written out of the stories?

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
[Guest]: Was there possibly more to them?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
[Guest]: And that was when I started researching them

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
[Guest]: and I found Ruby Lal's book, and where I

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
[Guest]: realized that the very idea of the harem,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
[Guest]: which to my mind, like to yours,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
[Guest]: was something very exotic, was

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
[Guest]: actually something that we had inherited from the

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
[Guest]: European gaze, because in parallel

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
[Guest]: there was the, the Europeans were coming

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
[Guest]: to India at the same time, and they wrote extensively

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
[Guest]: about the Mughals, because they were fascinated

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
[Guest]: by this culture. So we

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
[Guest]: have all this writing about the Mughals and the

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
[Guest]: harem, and they were fascinated by the

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
[Guest]: harem because they had no access to it.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
[Guest]: And yet they could sense that the women in the

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
[Guest]: harem had power, they had money,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
[Guest]: and they had influence. So it fascinated

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
[Guest]: them and horrified them in equal measure,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
[Guest]: because at the same time in Europe,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
[Guest]: Victorian Europe, and before that,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
[Guest]: women had no power, they were not allowed

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
[Guest]: to control their own money. They were meant

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
[Guest]: to be rather, you know, quiet and

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
[Guest]: hold their opinions to themselves.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
[Guest]: So this was something very contrary to what the

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
[Guest]: men had experienced in their own country. So they

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
[Guest]: came here with this mixture of abhorrence

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
[Guest]: and excitement. And they created

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
[Guest]: this fantasy world of the harem.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
[Guest]: And it is a fantasy because

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
[Guest]: they had no access to this harem.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
[Guest]: Nor were they physically allowed

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
[Guest]: to enter that space, nor could they speak

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
[Guest]: the language. So there were many layers of

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
[Guest]: obstruction between them and these Mughal women,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
[Guest]: but that did not stop them from fantasizing,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
[Guest]: from listening to bazaar gossip,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
[Guest]: from gleaning bits and pieces of information,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
[Guest]: and bringing out these

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
[Guest]: novels and novellas of exotic

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
[Guest]: life, which became

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
[Guest]: extremely popular back home

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
[Guest]: in Europe, and which in a way

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
[Guest]: then percolated down to us

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
[Guest]: till today, where we sort of have in the

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
[Guest]: back of our mind this idea that

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
[Guest]: women in a Mughal harem, all they did

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
[Guest]: was one woman was there in the middle of

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
[Guest]: the room waiting for the Pacha all day,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
[Guest]: she's trying to attract his attention,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
[Guest]: she's gossiping and bitching about her other co-wives,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
[Guest]: and her whole life is

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
[Guest]: spent in this decadence of

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
[Guest]: beautifying herself and waiting

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
[Guest]: for the sexual favors of

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
[Guest]: the Pacha. And this

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
[Guest]: is an entirely false view,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
[Guest]: which we can see from Rubi Lal's work

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
[Guest]: and from the other readings that I've done around it.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
[Guest]: And the Mughal harem, as I've

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
[Guest]: written in my book, was a place of

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
[Guest]: in fact, it was a place of great solidarity

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
[Guest]: amongst women. Most of the

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
[Guest]: women in a harem were not sexually available

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
[Guest]: to the Pacha at all. It was

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
[Guest]: a huge space, with

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
[Guest]: people like the Pacha's sisters,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
[Guest]: his unmarried cousins, his aunts,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
[Guest]: his grandmothers, his

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
[Guest]: foster mothers, milk mothers, his milk sisters,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
[Guest]: there were so many people, there were

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
[Guest]: visitors, and then there was all the

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
[Guest]: retinue around these individual women.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
[Guest]: His wives brought their retinues with them, so

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
[Guest]: when they came in from a different place, they brought their own

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
[Guest]: cooks, they brought their masseuses, they brought their

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
[Guest]: priests, they brought so many other women,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
[Guest]: none of whom were sexually available

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
[Guest]: to the Pacha. So this idea

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
[Guest]: of all these women being sexually available

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
[Guest]: is something completely false.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
[Guest]: And on the other hand, these women had

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
[Guest]: productive, interesting lives,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
[Guest]: they earned a salary,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
[Guest]: they had jobs, fixed jobs, for which they

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
[Guest]: had a salary. So they were

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
[Guest]: carrying out a function. And the

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
[Guest]: ones at the top, obviously, had

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
[Guest]: an enormous amount of money as

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
[Guest]: the Mughal empire grew richer,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
[Guest]: the individual women grew richer as well.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
[Guest]: And it's very interesting because

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
[Guest]: if you look at the way the men write about

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
[Guest]: it, like the way I was telling you, the Jesuit

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
[Guest]: missionaries, for example, they had

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
[Guest]: only one idea, which was to proselytize

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
[Guest]: and to convert. So obviously for them

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
[Guest]: all these women were just in the

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
[Guest]: way of the Pacha and trying to lure him into

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
[Guest]: temptation, and they write about them like that.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
[Guest]: On the other hand, if you look at

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
[Guest]: the writings of women, there are some women who have written

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
[Guest]: about the harem, and they write about it

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
[Guest]: very differently. For example,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
[Guest]: if you look at Lady Molly Montague,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
[Guest]: she was the wife of the ambassador to

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
[Guest]: the Ottomans in Turkey

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
[Guest]: in the 18th century.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
[Guest]: And she writes about them

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
[Guest]: and she says, you know, she had access to the

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
[Guest]: harem, obviously, as being a woman, and she

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
[Guest]: goes with them to their baths.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
[Guest]: And she writes about this incident in

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
[Guest]: which she is taken to the baths and the women want

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
[Guest]: to help her remove her clothes.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
[Guest]: So they remove her clothes and then

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
[Guest]: all those Turkish ladies step back in horror

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
[Guest]: and they gasp and they say, what are you

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
[Guest]: wearing? Because she was wearing stays.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
[Guest]: You know, those are made out of whale bones and they were

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
[Guest]: made to keep women's waist very tiny

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
[Guest]: and narrow so that you could barely breathe.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
[Guest]: And they told her, you tell us that

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
[Guest]: our husbands are cruel with us, but look how

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
[Guest]: cruel your husband is with you and making you

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
[Guest]: wear these horrible clothes where you cannot even

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
[Guest]: move and breathe. So it's a very

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
[Guest]: interesting, you know, view we

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
[Guest]: have into this harem of how

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
[Guest]: the other women were viewing her and

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
[Guest]: how she was viewing those other women, you know.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
[Guest]: So she had come with her

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
[Guest]: preconception that these women are all debased and

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
[Guest]: they're degraded and she writes saying actually

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
[Guest]: no, they have this freedom, they don't

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
[Guest]: have to wear stays like I do.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
[Guest]: They have money. She says, who in England

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
[Guest]: controls, which woman controls her own

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
[Guest]: money? They don't. When they get married

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
[Guest]: they hand over their money to their husband. So she

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
[Guest]: was amazed that these women,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
[Guest]: Muslim women, were able to control,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
[Guest]: they were financially independent, which was a huge

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
[Guest]: thing. She writes about this to her friends.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
[Guest]: So there are these many ways

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
[Guest]: where the voices of the women

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
[Guest]: writing about the harem completely

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
[Guest]: contradicts the voices of the men.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
[Guest]: And so when you put the two together

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
[Guest]: you get a very different picture

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
[Guest]: of the harem and how it really was.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, reading about the harems, it just kind

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
[Amit Varma]: of struck me that, my God,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
[Amit Varma]: not only is it not the simplistic

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
[Amit Varma]: notion of a harem that I had in my head,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
[Amit Varma]: but the term that

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
[Amit Varma]: struck me was political economy. It's so deeply

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
[Amit Varma]: complex, you know, they have

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
[Amit Varma]: money, they have power, they have

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
[Amit Varma]: webs of influence and

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
[Amit Varma]: it's a question that I

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
[Amit Varma]: often ask the historians on my show

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
[Amit Varma]: and I'll ask a more

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
[Amit Varma]: elongated version of it to you.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
[Amit Varma]: The question I ask is that

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
[Amit Varma]: given that we tend to suffer

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
[Unknown]: from the hindsight bias, because

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
[Amit Varma]: everything that has happened seems inevitable.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Number one, how do we

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
[Amit Varma]: remove our knowledge of what has already

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
[Amit Varma]: happened to look at a specific event

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
[Amit Varma]: at a current time in a fresh way?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
[Amit Varma]: And the question is even more

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
[Amit Varma]: complicated for someone like you who's writing about

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
[Amit Varma]: this period, being that

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
[Amit Varma]: one also has all those

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
[Amit Varma]: prior impressions and biases

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
[Amit Varma]: that have come from firstly the European

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
[Amit Varma]: gaze which you spoke about

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
[Amit Varma]: and also even the male local

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
[Amit Varma]: gaze, like you've mentioned that Abu Fazal

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
[Amit Varma]: for example, wrote very

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
[Amit Varma]: very differently about the same

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
[Unknown]: emperor and the same happenings and someone like

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
[Unknown]: Gulbadan did, who is bringing

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
[Amit Varma]: in all those nuances and the rounded picture.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
[Amit Varma]: So mentally, did you have to

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
[Amit Varma]: take that step back and recast

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
[Guest]: everything and look, how do you do that?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
[Guest]: Yes, that's an interesting point

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
[Guest]: and

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
[Guest]: I think the only way

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
[Guest]: to do that is

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
[Guest]: like you said for Abu al-Fazal

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
[Guest]: Abu al-Fazal in a way

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
[Guest]: does as much harm to the

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
[Guest]: women as the Europeans do

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
[Guest]: because even though his idea and

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
[Guest]: his motivation was very different. He wanted

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
[Guest]: to create in Akbar the semi-divine

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
[Guest]: king, you know, who was above

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
[Guest]: all reproach and so his women

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
[Guest]: had to be also above all reproach

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
[Guest]: and therefore they had to be completely chased

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
[Guest]: and to be completely chased you had to

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
[Guest]: be completely hidden. So he hides them

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
[Guest]: away in this elaborate

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
[Guest]: framework and he says they are all, he gives

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
[Guest]: them titles and they are all chased, whether they are

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
[Guest]: newborn babies or whether they are

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
[Guest]: old ladies, everybody is the same, they

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
[Guest]: are all chased, you know, and they have

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
[Guest]: no individuality, they are completely hidden. So

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
[Guest]: in a way he does as much disservice

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
[Guest]: to us today trying

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
[Guest]: to find out about women as the European

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
[Guest]: men did. But luckily

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
[Guest]: as always happens in history

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
[Guest]: you know, you cannot control things no matter

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
[Guest]: how hard or how much money you have at your disposal

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
[Guest]: and luckily for us there is somebody like Badawni

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
[Guest]: who wrote an illicit biography

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
[Guest]: of Akbar who was very critical, who

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
[Guest]: was an extremely erudite and learned

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
[Guest]: man himself but he was just critical of

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
[Guest]: Akbar's religious policies, that's

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
[Guest]: the only thing he held against Akbar and

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
[Guest]: so he wrote this illicit biography of

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
[Guest]: Akbar and through his words

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
[Guest]: inadvertently we find out

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
[Guest]: so much about the women because he blames

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
[Guest]: the Hindu wives of Akbar

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
[Guest]: for all these terrible changes that

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
[Guest]: he is seeing in his beloved Muslim Padshah

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
[Guest]: and he says, you know, Akbar is like this

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
[Guest]: today, he is worshipping the sun,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
[Guest]: he is wearing a tilak, he is wearing a rakhi

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
[Guest]: these terrible customs, he has

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
[Guest]: brought dogs into the place, you know

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
[Guest]: he is horrified and he clearly says

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
[Guest]: it is because from his early

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
[Guest]: age he has been in the company

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
[Guest]: of lousy Hindus, Brahmins

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
[Guest]: and Hindu women, his wives.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
[Guest]: So we have here in black and white

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
[Guest]: and writing, we see the influence

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
[Guest]: of people like Harkabai, the Rajput

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
[Guest]: woman that Akbar married, so

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
[Guest]: it is very interesting for me because

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
[Guest]: I am setting out to find this connection

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
[Guest]: now perhaps if somebody had not set out

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
[Guest]: to look for this, you would just slip over it

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
[Guest]: and you would be like, okay, there is nothing on the women

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
[Guest]: but because I am always looking

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
[Guest]: out for any reference which

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
[Guest]: ties in the women to influence, which

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
[Guest]: ties in the women to the way the men

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
[Guest]: thought and what the men did, so

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
[Guest]: that is how I am able to pick out these things

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
[Guest]: I think because I am looking at it

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
[Guest]: in a way from my own filter.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
[Guest]: So then I have Badawni, then I have Gulbadan

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
[Guest]: luckily, as you know I was telling you

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
[Guest]: earlier, we could so easily have

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
[Guest]: lost Gulbadan's voice because Akbar

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
[Guest]: when he was, when the empire was

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
[Guest]: finally settled and he said okay now

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
[Guest]: I must create a history for myself

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
[Guest]: because that was how Mughal emperors

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
[Guest]: you know sort of created legitimacy

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
[Guest]: for themselves. He asked Abul Fazal

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
[Guest]: to write a biography but wonderfully

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
[Guest]: for us he also asked the people who

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
[Guest]: had first hand knowledge of Humayun

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
[Guest]: and Babur to write about their memories

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
[Guest]: so he asked Johar, the

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
[Guest]: water carrier for Humayun

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
[Guest]: he asked other people and he asked his aunt

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
[Guest]: for whom he had a great deal of respect

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
[Amit Varma]: and Gulbadan wrote her wonderful biography

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and she is of course Babur's daughter, Humayun's sister

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
[Amit Varma]: that's right, Humayun's sister

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
[Guest]: she has experience, she came to India

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
[Guest]: at the age of six with Babur

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
[Guest]: then Babur died, she was with

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
[Guest]: Humayun through all his travails

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
[Guest]: you know when he was thrown out of India

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
[Guest]: by Sikandar Lodi, she was with him

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
[Guest]: in Kabul for all those years, she was

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
[Guest]: with him back when he came to India, she was

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
[Guest]: here when he finally died, she was in

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
[Guest]: India when Akbar became Padshah and then

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
[Guest]: for the rest of her very long life

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
[Guest]: she saw Akbar become a king

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
[Guest]: establish himself and establish the Mughal Empire

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
[Guest]: so an extraordinary woman who lived through

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
[Guest]: three different Padshahs

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
[Guest]: so we have her wonderful first hand account

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
[Guest]: of what all this

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
[Guest]: peripatetic journeying, what this

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
[Guest]: adventure, what this adventure

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
[Guest]: of forming the Mughal Empire

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
[Guest]: in India with these timid people

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
[Guest]: what it was like, we have through her eyes

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
[Guest]: and we could easily have lost that

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
[Guest]: because there was one copy of it

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
[Guest]: only one copy made, yes, 500

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
[Guest]: years ago and immediately

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
[Guest]: after she had written it, it was lost

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
[Guest]: nobody referred to it,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
[Guest]: nobody else, no further biographer

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
[Guest]: later in time ever referred to this

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
[Guest]: book so it disappeared from even our

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
[Guest]: memory, then sometime in the 19th

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
[Guest]: century, an Englishman with the

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
[Guest]: East India Company was buying up

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
[Guest]: manuscripts like you do in the local kabaddi

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
[Guest]: bazaar, you go and you buy whatever old objects

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
[Guest]: you like, so he had a collection of a thousand

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
[Guest]: manuscripts, some worthless, some

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
[Guest]: interesting, when he died his widow

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
[Guest]: went back to England and she had all

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
[Guest]: these manuscripts, she needed to raise money, she was a

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000
[Guest]: widow, she sold them to the British Library

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
[Guest]: the British Library early in

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
[Guest]: the 20th century had some of these

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
[Guest]: translated into English by Beveridge

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
[Guest]: and she discovered that one

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
[Guest]: of these manuscripts was actually the

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
[Guest]: biography of Barber's daughter

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
[Guest]: herself, Gulbadan's biography, so that's

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
[Guest]: how 500 years later it came

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
[Guest]: back into India, into our public

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
[Guest]: consciousness and we realized that we have

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
[Guest]: this first hand account, but

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
[Guest]: so you see, it takes a little bit of putting

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
[Guest]: all these stories together

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
[Guest]: to get an idea of what I want to talk about

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
[Amit Varma]: which is what the women were up to

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
[Amit Varma]: And while there's sheer luck, it also strikes me that there must be

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
[Guest]: so much else that is lost

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
[Guest]: Exactly, I think, and this is only half

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
[Guest]: of the book, Gulbadan's biography

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
[Guest]: was broken into two, torn into two pieces

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
[Guest]: and we only have the first section

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
[Guest]: so I'm always thinking, wow, who knows

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
[Guest]: in which Kabadi Bazaar, there may be the second section

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
[Guest]: somewhere lying around, the second half

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
[Guest]: of Humayun's life and that's still

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
[Guest]: undiscovered, maybe it's there somewhere, who knows

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Maybe one of the listeners of this show

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
[Guest]: will go to the nearest Kabadi Bazaar and find it

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
[Amit Varma]: I hope so! Make an attempt

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
[Amit Varma]: please tag us if you do find it

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
[Amit Varma]: look now at the start

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
[Amit Varma]: of your book, Daughters of the Sun, and the start

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
[Amit Varma]: of the Mughal dynasty

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
[Amit Varma]: itself, though of course as you point out that

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Babur would have been very upset

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
[Unknown]: that it was called the Mughal dynasty

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Yes

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Because obviously it's a hug back to the Mongol

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
[Amit Varma]: part of his legacy and he was more proud

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
[Unknown]: of the Timurid side of it

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
[Amit Varma]: And you'd spoken earlier about, you know

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
[Amit Varma]: peripatetic early Mughals

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
[Amit Varma]: but what really struck me was that it's not

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
[Amit Varma]: just the men

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
[Amit Varma]: who are peripatetic, wherever they go

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
[Amit Varma]: you know this Haraman

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
[Unknown]: is that the correct pronunciation? Yes, yes

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
[Unknown]: Wherever they go, this Haraman is travelling with them

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
[Amit Varma]: which is this retinue of women

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
[Amit Varma]: and these are not retinue of necessarily

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
[Guest]: wives or mistresses or whatever

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
[Guest]: these are aunts, grandmothers

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
[Amit Varma]: these are serious people who are making

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
[Amit Varma]: serious decisions

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
[Amit Varma]: and one of the really interesting characters

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
[Amit Varma]: his father of course died when he was 13

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
[Amit Varma]: I think, right? That's right

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
[Amit Varma]: And you point out about how a lot of his

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
[Amit Varma]: guidance in terms of politics

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
[Amit Varma]: strategy and all that came from his grandmother

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
[Amit Varma]: Ehsan Daulat Begum

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
[Amit Varma]: and she also has a very interesting story

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
[Guest]: from her youth which reveals a lot of character

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
[Guest]: Yes, there's just one episode

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
[Guest]: that describes her

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
[Guest]: Babur is very scathing when he writes

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
[Guest]: about his own father, you know, he writes about how

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
[Guest]: he drank too much and he was overweight because of

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
[Guest]: that, you know, so he writes with a pretty

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
[Guest]: jaundiced view about his father

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
[Guest]: but never about the women in his life

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
[Guest]: he writes only with respect and love about the women

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
[Guest]: in his life, whether it is his mother, his

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
[Guest]: grandmother, his elder sister Khanzada

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
[Guest]: these three women who were extremely

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
[Guest]: influential in his life and he writes about

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
[Guest]: Ehsan Daulat Begum that at one

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
[Guest]: point when she was a much younger woman

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
[Guest]: she was travelling with her husband and at

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
[Guest]: some point in some conflict

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
[Guest]: she was captured by a chieftain

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
[Guest]: and the chieftain was very happy and he

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
[Guest]: said, I'm going to offer you to one of my

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
[Guest]: amirs and that is

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
[Guest]: your fate and so she is like, okay, she

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
[Guest]: pretends to be very happy with the decision and she

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
[Guest]: says, fine, no problem and she gets ready to

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
[Guest]: receive this amir at night

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
[Guest]: but actually what happens is that when the

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
[Guest]: amir enters her quarters, she has posted

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
[Guest]: her women around the door and

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
[Guest]: they pounce upon him, they catch him and they throw him

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
[Guest]: out of the window and he breaks his neck and he dies

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
[Guest]: and so the next morning the chieftain

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
[Guest]: comes to her and says, what have you done, how dare you, you know

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
[Guest]: and she says, I am already

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
[Guest]: married and I have a husband and if this is

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
[Guest]: the way you treat honourable women then do with me

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
[Guest]: as you will and the man is so

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
[Guest]: impressed that obviously he sends her

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
[Guest]: back to her husband with honour

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
[Guest]: and these are the sort of

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
[Guest]: you know, brave

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
[Guest]: resolute women that Babur

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
[Guest]: luckily has around him

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
[Guest]: to show them the way when he is only a 13

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
[Guest]: year old boy really, you know

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
[Guest]: trying to find his way in the world, surrounded

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
[Guest]: by his bloodthirsty uncles who would

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
[Guest]: kill him in an instant for the throne themselves

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
[Guest]: and it is because he has his mother and his

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
[Guest]: grandmother and Khanzada Begum around him

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
[Guest]: that he survives at all, you know, never mind

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
[Guest]: becomes the founder of the Mughal Empire

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
[Guest]: and he writes about this and he writes

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
[Guest]: eloquently about Khanzada

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
[Guest]: Begum, how much he owes to her because

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
[Guest]: when he is surrounded by Shabani Khan

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
[Guest]: Uzbek, who is his great foe

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
[Guest]: in Samarkand

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
[Guest]: Shabani Khan makes an offer

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
[Guest]: to Babur and he says

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
[Guest]: I will let you go, you can go with your

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
[Guest]: life and your small retinue but you leave

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
[Guest]: your sister with me and you know, leave her

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
[Guest]: as my captive and Babur is

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
[Guest]: forced to do that and it is a shameful thing

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
[Guest]: for him to do because it shows that he has

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
[Guest]: no power and he has to leave

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
[Guest]: Khanzada Begum but Khanzada Begum

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
[Guest]: herself is never blamed or any

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
[Guest]: way demeaned for having to become the

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
[Guest]: wife of an enemy. She lives there

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
[Guest]: for 10 years after Shabani Khan

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
[Guest]: Uzbek eventually divorces her because he gets

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
[Guest]: fed up of how much she keeps talking about her own

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
[Guest]: family which I find really

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
[Guest]: evocative and amazing which means even

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
[Guest]: in confinement, even as a prisoner

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
[Guest]: of the lord's enemy

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
[Guest]: she must have kept on

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
[Guest]: talking about Babur and the Timurids, you know

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
[Guest]: so he gets fed up of her and he

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
[Guest]: gives her to a more lowly person as that

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
[Guest]: person's wife. So you can imagine

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
[Guest]: how it must have been very

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
[Guest]: humiliating for Khanzada Begum but she never

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
[Guest]: loses her spirit and after 10 years

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
[Guest]: when Shabani Khan Uzbek is defeated

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
[Guest]: she is sent back to Babur

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
[Guest]: and Babur is delighted to have

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
[Guest]: her back and he makes her Patsha Begum

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
[Guest]: which is the most respected

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
[Guest]: woman of the harem

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
[Guest]: and all his descendants

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
[Guest]: equally respect her and

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
[Guest]: she is never in any way

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
[Guest]: maimed or made to feel guilty

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
[Guest]: for the fact that she was the wife of two other

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
[Guest]: men before she came to Babur's

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
[Guest]: court which I found so refreshing

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
[Guest]: when we think about her exact contemporaries

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
[Guest]: the Rajputs, you know who put

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
[Guest]: so much worth on a woman's sexual

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
[Guest]: chastity that they would prefer

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
[Guest]: them to commit sati and johar

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
[Guest]: at the time of facing an enemy

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
[Guest]: rather than you know to

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
[Guest]: take a chance on what might happen to their life

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
[Guest]: so their sexual chastity is placed above

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
[Guest]: everything else, above them being

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
[Guest]: brothers, above them being human beings, above them being

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
[Guest]: wives, it is about being sexually chaste

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
[Guest]: so it is the control of a

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
[Guest]: woman's sexuality which is so important

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
[Guest]: whereas the Timurids are very

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
[Guest]: pragmatic about the fact that they are constantly

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
[Guest]: travelling, they are constantly warring

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
[Guest]: therefore their women are sometimes captured

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
[Guest]: it is not their fault, indeed when they

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
[Guest]: are brought back they are always honoured

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
[Guest]: so this was something that I thought people might not

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
[Guest]: know about and that it's worth talking about

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
[Amit Varma]: This took me by surprise and what also took me

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
[Amit Varma]: by surprise about Khanzada was that

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
[Guest]: she marries again and you contrast

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
[Amit Varma]: that with the stigma on widow remarriage

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
[Amit Varma]: in India where once you are widowed

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
[Amit Varma]: if you don't immolate yourself

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
[Guest]: you basically wear white and you are pretty much done

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
[Guest]: Correct, in fact

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
[Guest]: the Timurids regularly encouraged

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
[Guest]: remarriage and many of the women we find

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
[Guest]: were remarried and Anbar

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
[Guest]: even talks about it clearly

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
[Guest]: and says you know I don't understand

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
[Guest]: why amongst the Hindus a woman

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
[Guest]: when she is widowed

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
[Guest]: she is not allowed to go to another man

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
[Guest]: he says I don't understand this

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
[Guest]: and I don't understand that a man

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
[Guest]: finds virtue in making

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
[Guest]: his wife die when he dies

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
[Guest]: so he was actually puzzled by this

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
[Guest]: he could not understand this whole concept

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
[Guest]: of sexual chastity and he

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
[Guest]: finally forbade it and he said

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
[Guest]: especially if the woman is young when she gets

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
[Guest]: widowed and if she has

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
[Guest]: perhaps not even lain

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
[Guest]: with her husband because he died so young

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
[Guest]: she is absolutely not to

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
[Guest]: commit sati and in any case

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
[Guest]: she is never to be forced so you know

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
[Guest]: he sent ministers out

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
[Guest]: into his empire to make sure that no woman

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
[Guest]: now how much that happened on the ground

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
[Guest]: I don't know but they were to check

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
[Guest]: every case of sati and make sure

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
[Guest]: that if the woman was determined only

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
[Guest]: then would she be allowed to commit sati

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
[Guest]: and no one was to force her so he was

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
[Guest]: very puzzled so clearly this was

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
[Guest]: a deeply entrenched aspect

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
[Guest]: of the Timurids or the Mughals

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
[Guest]: that there was no shame

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
[Guest]: in remarrying if you

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
[Guest]: are widowed it was not your fault unlike

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
[Guest]: the Hindus who thought it is your fate if you are

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
[Guest]: widowed that means it is something you have

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
[Guest]: perhaps some crime or punishment for

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
[Guest]: some past life misdeed and therefore

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
[Guest]: you lose your husband and you

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
[Guest]: must die. They felt they didn't

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
[Guest]: see things in the same way at all so a woman's

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
[Guest]: chastity was not valued

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
[Guest]: above everything else about above

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
[Guest]: her abilities above her

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
[Guest]: capacity to form a new relationship

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
[Guest]: so I found that very interesting

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
[Guest]: right from the time of Khandzada so that means

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
[Guest]: 500 years ago you know from the time

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
[Guest]: of Babur itself there was no

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
[Guest]: undue importance laid on a woman's

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
[Guest]: honor being related to her chastity

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
[Amit Varma]: no and you know we often sort

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
[Amit Varma]: of in our popular conception

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
[Amit Varma]: of those times today we think

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
[Amit Varma]: of them as invading barbarians

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
[Amit Varma]: who came into our very evolved

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
[Amit Varma]: culture and all of that and

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of spoilt it

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
[Amit Varma]: but here it strikes to me and even

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
[Amit Varma]: you know lot of what else is in your book

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
[Amit Varma]: also points out that they were actually fairly enlightened

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
[Guest]: in many ways towards their women

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
[Guest]: not as much as we would like today

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
[Guest]: of course but no but even

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
[Guest]: so for those times I find

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
[Guest]: that it was quite

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
[Guest]: refreshingly honest the way they

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
[Guest]: viewed their women that we always think

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
[Guest]: of them in purdah there was a very light

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
[Guest]: very porous purdah in fact

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
[Guest]: you know we forget that they are descendants

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
[Guest]: of Timur and that is whom they claim

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
[Guest]: as their forefather and if we look

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
[Guest]: at Timur's court for example there is the

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
[Guest]: writings of the

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
[Guest]: Spanish ambassador I think Rui Gonzalez

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
[Guest]: who writes about his encounters at

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
[Guest]: the Timur court he goes there as an ambassador he is

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
[Guest]: received very well he attends all these parties

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
[Guest]: and he writes about Timur's

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
[Guest]: wife and he can

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
[Guest]: the fact that he writes about her physically

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
[Guest]: he describes her that means he can see her

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
[Guest]: and her veil is very very light

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
[Guest]: so she can be easily seen by all the men

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
[Guest]: who are sitting there he describes

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
[Guest]: her complexion her hair everything so she is

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
[Guest]: clearly visible she comes and sits

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
[Guest]: between them there are men with her

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
[Guest]: there are women with her it is a mixed gathering

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
[Guest]: and she drinks and her friends the women

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
[Guest]: all drink and in fact he writes that they drink

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
[Guest]: sometimes a little too much so you see

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
[Guest]: this is a very different idea

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
[Guest]: of what we think a harem

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
[Guest]: may have been like here is a mixed company

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
[Guest]: they are singing and dancing he says for days

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
[Guest]: so this is something very different

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
[Guest]: the Timurs of course

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
[Guest]: they were conquerors also

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
[Guest]: and I am not going to gloss over that but they

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
[Guest]: were also great builders of city

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
[Guest]: they were great admirers of

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
[Guest]: culture of poetry of

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
[Guest]: language of literature Babur wrote his own biography

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
[Guest]: as you know a very entertaining biography

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
[Guest]: so there are these other aspects

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
[Guest]: they were not at all just

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
[Guest]: this marauding entity that

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
[Guest]: we have been made to believe

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
[Guest]: that they were they brought with them

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
[Guest]: a lot of other influences which remain

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
[Guest]: with us too which is very much part of our

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
[Guest]: DNA I think it is in the molecule of

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
[Guest]: every at least North Indian today

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
[Guest]: whether it is the food the clothes the language

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
[Guest]: the etiquette the adab that we have

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
[Guest]: it is all Timurid and it has

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
[Guest]: filtered down through us because these were

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
[Guest]: things that were valued in that time

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
[Guest]: when they came here they brought this all the

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
[Guest]: minor courts as they integrated

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
[Guest]: wanted to absorb this culture and they did

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
[Guest]: whether it was the Rajasthani courts

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
[Guest]: Jaisalmer, Amir all these courts

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
[Guest]: they took part of this culture and they

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
[Guest]: made it uniquely Indian

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
[Guest]: in that genius way that we have

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
[Guest]: but the root of it is

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
[Guest]: Timurid and it survived because it

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
[Guest]: was buoyant and it was vibrant

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
[Guest]: and it was something worth

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
[Amit Varma]: keeping. And what

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
[Amit Varma]: also kind of struck me you know while

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
[Amit Varma]: reading about Babur's adventures like

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
[Amit Varma]: you know after he lost Samarkand he was

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of travelling for a long time

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
[Amit Varma]: and then he finally goes to Kabul

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
[Amit Varma]: and he stays in Kabul for 20 years and then

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
[Amit Varma]: he you know goes to Hindustan

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
[Amit Varma]: where for the first time he really a lot of the

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
[Amit Varma]: women just stay behind and it kind of

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
[Amit Varma]: struck me that in all of this constant travel

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
[Amit Varma]: the sense of rootedness that he

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
[Unknown]: gets is from these women

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
[Amit Varma]: who you know

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
[Amit Varma]: and they are not just wives and mistresses

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
[Amit Varma]: they are aunts and his mother

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
[Amit Varma]: was his mother part of it?

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
[Guest]: Yes yes of course

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Hamida Banu Vega

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
[Amit Varma]: At one point you said that is where the sense of home

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
[Amit Varma]: comes from for these constant travellers

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
[Amit Varma]: and then he goes to Agra

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
[Amit Varma]: and you know

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
[Amit Varma]: when he finally wins his battle against Lodhi

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
[Amit Varma]: and he is sacking Agra and he

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
[Amit Varma]: sends so many jewels and riches

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
[Amit Varma]: and all of that which you have described in detail

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
[Amit Varma]: specifically for the women back to

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Kabul and one of the sort of threads

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
[Amit Varma]: running through the stories

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
[Amit Varma]: of Babur Humayun and all the way to Akbar

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
[Amit Varma]: is the love and reverence they have

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
[Guest]: for these women

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
[Guest]: Yes and in fact this list that you are talking

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
[Guest]: about of jewels and clothes

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
[Guest]: and dancing girls and all this that he

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
[Guest]: sends back is only listed

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
[Guest]: by Gulbadan no other biographer writes

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
[Guest]: about this so this again

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
[Guest]: if we didn't have a woman's voice we would

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
[Guest]: not see this aspect of their culture

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
[Guest]: of how they showed appreciation

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
[Guest]: of how wealth was distributed

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
[Guest]: so she writes in great detail about who was given

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
[Guest]: what so yes they

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
[Guest]: revere these women these women are

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
[Guest]: very important to them because they are

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
[Guest]: carriers of their culture

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
[Guest]: they are carriers of their language

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
[Guest]: of the stories they tell each other

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
[Guest]: of the stories they will tell the children so that the

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
[Guest]: children know where they come from who these

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
[Guest]: Timurids are you know so

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
[Guest]: they are very very essential

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
[Guest]: to the creation of a Timurid

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
[Guest]: legacy in India and one of the

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
[Guest]: very first thing where the Babur after Panipat

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
[Guest]: he says my generals

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
[Guest]: even though these are battle hardened

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
[Guest]: great men who are used to all

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
[Guest]: kinds of tribulations in the

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
[Guest]: heat of Hindustan they were like ok we have

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
[Guest]: won this battle for you now we are heading back to

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
[Guest]: Kabul so he realizes what's happening

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000
[Guest]: and he calls for the women because he knows that

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
[Guest]: it is the women which will anchor the men

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000
[Guest]: to a country it is not even riches

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
[Guest]: it is not even the

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
[Guest]: idea of future grandeur

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
[Guest]: it is the women because they bring with them a way

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
[Guest]: of life and it is this way of

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
[Guest]: life that can only be transmitted

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
[Guest]: the men are too busy doing their

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
[Guest]: battles and their you know interactions

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
[Guest]: with the

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
[Guest]: aggrandizing their territories it is the

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
[Guest]: women who bring their culture Akbar

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
[Guest]: does the same thing when he becomes king

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
[Guest]: so young and he starts

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
[Guest]: to found his empire one of the

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
[Guest]: first thing because at that point

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
[Guest]: Humayun died so early that he hadn't yet called

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
[Guest]: for his harem to come

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
[Guest]: from Kabul so one of the first thing

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
[Guest]: after he wins a few battles Akbar

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
[Guest]: similarly almost identically to Babur

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
[Guest]: realizes that his men will not stay

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
[Guest]: carry on like this because

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
[Guest]: you know they are feeling a little bit

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000
[Guest]: orphaned in India now

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
[Guest]: you know and they are attacked by all

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
[Guest]: kinds of people who are trying to make their own

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
[Guest]: claims for the throne and they are ready

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
[Guest]: to leave and he does the same thing he calls

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
[Guest]: for the women and he writes and he

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000
[Guest]: says these women are required

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
[Guest]: to have the men stay and for the men

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
[Guest]: to feel that this is a place that they

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000
[Guest]: can call home that this is a place that one

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000
[Guest]: day can be theirs and can be

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
[Guest]: you know part of their life so it's

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
[Guest]: very interesting and right till the later

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000
[Guest]: stages the women are some of the last

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
[Guest]: to speak the Turkish language and

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
[Guest]: you know obviously your language is so

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
[Guest]: much part of your identity so

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
[Guest]: Gulbadan and Hamida Banu

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
[Guest]: all these women who spoke Turkish

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000
[Guest]: as they die out we slowly

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
[Guest]: see that Turkish you know completely

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
[Guest]: loses its hold over these over

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
[Guest]: the men over the Pasha and they say

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
[Guest]: Jahangir I think says proudly

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
[Guest]: I can speak a few lines of Turkish

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
[Guest]: but clearly by then it is only

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
[Guest]: you know a sort of a flourish but it

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
[Guest]: is not their mother tongue anymore

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
[Guest]: it is the women who carry language

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
[Guest]: and who carry that sort of

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
[Guest]: the culture of memories and

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
[Amit Varma]: of stories. Yeah I mean home is

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
[Amit Varma]: where the women are and it also kind

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000
[Amit Varma]: of strikes me while reading this book that you know looking

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
[Amit Varma]: back we know what happened again

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
[Amit Varma]: hindsight so you can you know we

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
[Unknown]: look as the Mughals okay they've been here for so many

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
[Amit Varma]: hundred years and blah blah blah but if you think

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
[Amit Varma]: about them at the time they've just

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
[Amit Varma]: landed up in this strange land they don't

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
[Amit Varma]: speak that language they have no roots

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
[Amit Varma]: there everyone is a foreigner

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000
[Amit Varma]: and therefore suspicious and we

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
[Amit Varma]: think of the Mughal dynasty as a given and

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
[Amit Varma]: it's such a strong solid monolithic

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000
[Amit Varma]: thing but after Humayun loses

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
[Amit Varma]: to Sher Shah Suri and he's just being

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000
[Amit Varma]: chased all over the place you

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000
[Amit Varma]: have absolutely I mean at that

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
[Amit Varma]: moment he has absolutely no idea how

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
[Guest]: he's going to end up. No not at all and in fact

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
[Guest]: at that time it seems like you know

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
[Guest]: the Mughals are only perhaps

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
[Guest]: you know an aberration of

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
[Guest]: a few years a few decades maybe you know with

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
[Guest]: Babur and that is all they will ever be

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
[Guest]: because the Sher Shah Suri

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
[Guest]: is a very talented man and it looks like

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
[Guest]: you know he will prosper

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000
[Guest]: but

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
[Guest]: so it is true

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
[Guest]: that these

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
[Guest]: women I think without their presence

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
[Guest]: one almost feels

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
[Guest]: that perhaps the men would have also

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
[Guest]: lost hope at some point you know

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
[Guest]: and maybe not found it worth

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
[Guest]: their while because so many of their

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
[Guest]: generals were ready to leave at many

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
[Guest]: times you know of the empire

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
[Guest]: and it is only after Akbar really

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
[Guest]: that Akbar

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
[Guest]: begins to feel like a truly Hindustani

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
[Guest]: king you know his he spends

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
[Guest]: so much time with the locals from a very

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
[Guest]: young age he is always he has

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000
[Guest]: this great ability to communicate with people

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
[Guest]: of all classes and he spends a

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
[Guest]: lot of time with all his animal keepers

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
[Guest]: and he learns the language very quickly

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
[Guest]: and it is with Akbar that we really feel that

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
[Guest]: these kings are here to stay and they are Hindustani

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
[Guest]: kings now you know and that they have

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
[Guest]: brought in this culture but Akbar often

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
[Guest]: puts on this timid culture

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
[Guest]: for show to impress an ambassador

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000
[Guest]: or to impress some other

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000
[Guest]: visiting timid but it is not who

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000
[Guest]: he is he feels comfortable in

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
[Guest]: the culture of the country and you know

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000
[Guest]: in the people that surround him

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
[Amit Varma]: who are now Hindustani. The most

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
[Amit Varma]: fascinating character in your book I found was

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
[Unknown]: Gulbadan herself and you write

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000
[Amit Varma]: about how you know she saw Babur writing

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
[Amit Varma]: the Baburnama and then perhaps

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000
[Amit Varma]: that's how she got inspired to write it

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
[Amit Varma]: and it strikes me that

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
[Amit Varma]: it is only through Gulbadan in fact

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
[Amit Varma]: you're right I'll quote you it is

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000
[Amit Varma]: through Gulbadan's account and only

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
[Amit Varma]: hers that we can see Babur as a loving

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
[Amit Varma]: father a tempestuous family man

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
[Amit Varma]: and a devoted husband stop

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
[Amit Varma]: quote and how different is

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
[Amit Varma]: her portrayal of those times from other

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
[Amit Varma]: you know contemporary accounts that you read

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
[Guest]: well it's completely

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
[Guest]: different you know because especially when men are

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
[Guest]: writing about somebody

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
[Guest]: like Babur then they will focus on his battles

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
[Guest]: on his charisma certainly

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
[Guest]: you know his magnetic ability

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
[Guest]: to

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
[Guest]: interact with other men because he had this

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
[Guest]: majlis of men that he was very comfortable with

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
[Guest]: so those men wrote about those gatherings

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
[Guest]: of men you know where they drank all night

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
[Guest]: and you know sang songs and

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
[Guest]: tried out different mixtures of

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
[Guest]: drugs and so on

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
[Guest]: so we have Babur the

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
[Guest]: amazing strategist because he was a

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
[Guest]: wonderful strategist and you know how many

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
[Guest]: battles he won the battle of Panipat

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
[Guest]: how it was he won

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
[Guest]: it amazingly against all odds

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
[Guest]: so we see only that side of it

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
[Guest]: which is wonderful but it is one side

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
[Guest]: of it with Gulbadan we see

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
[Guest]: how much he loves his family

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
[Guest]: how he prefers one wife over

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
[Guest]: another his first wife his main wife

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
[Guest]: he calls her by her name

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
[Guest]: which I find very moving because by the time of Akbar

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
[Guest]: you can no longer

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
[Guest]: pronounce a woman's name

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000
[Guest]: and so therefore a certain part of their

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000
[Guest]: identity is lost a name is so important

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000
[Guest]: isn't it the way in which you are called

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
[Guest]: if you are only called by a title that somehow

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000
[Guest]: it is meant to aggrandize you but on a

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
[Guest]: human level it reduces you because you

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
[Guest]: no longer have your own separate identity

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000
[Guest]: but Babur calls her Maham Begum

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
[Guest]: so he always calls her by her name

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000
[Guest]: and Gulbadan writes that oh he calls out to Maham

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
[Guest]: and when she is coming from Kabul

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
[Guest]: after an absence of I think

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
[Guest]: a year and a half he pushes aside

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
[Guest]: his attendant he pushes aside his horse and goes

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
[Guest]: running you know so this image of

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
[Guest]: this amazing conqueror but he is running

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
[Guest]: to meet his wife whom he hasn't met for one and a half

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
[Guest]: years and he takes Gulbadan in his

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
[Guest]: arms also you know six year old daughter

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
[Guest]: whom he hasn't seen and he makes her eat

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
[Guest]: does this wonderful feast which is prepared

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
[Guest]: so yes it is through Gulbadan that

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
[Guest]: we see a different aspect

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
[Guest]: of this man you know so that he is not just

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
[Guest]: one dimensional we see him more as a

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
[Guest]: complete human being so the accounts

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
[Guest]: of women in no way

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
[Guest]: do they denigrate a man

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
[Guest]: on the contrary you know they give a more

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
[Guest]: complex and nuanced understanding of the men

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
[Guest]: too so to understand women's

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
[Guest]: history to talk about them to explore them

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000
[Guest]: is also to increase our understanding

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
[Guest]: of the men too it's not that it's in

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
[Guest]: any way making them less manly

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
[Amit Varma]: another of the interesting aspects of and

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
[Amit Varma]: this again goes back to the whole political economy

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000
[Amit Varma]: angle of these harems so to say

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
[Amit Varma]: is how all of these women

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
[Amit Varma]: especially the senior women like

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Khanzada and Dildar Begum

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
[Amit Varma]: are you know playing this part

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
[Amit Varma]: in almost

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
[Amit Varma]: ruffling feathers you know bringing

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
[Amit Varma]: sons together making peace

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
[Amit Varma]: between brothers you know Khanzada goes on

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
[Amit Varma]: a number of missions and in fact dies on one

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
[Guest]: of those so called diplomatic missions to bring

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
[Guest]: brothers together that's right

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
[Guest]: tell me a little bit about that so in fact

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
[Guest]: one of the missions that she sent

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000
[Guest]: on Humayun had to

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
[Guest]: fight with all of his brothers at one point

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
[Guest]: of or another three of his brothers

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
[Guest]: and the most resolute

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000
[Guest]: of his brothers against him was Kamran

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
[Guest]: who never came round to him the other two did

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
[Guest]: so Kamran never came round to his side

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000
[Guest]: and things were pretty hairy for him

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
[Guest]: at some times you know because he was being

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
[Guest]: chased by the Afghans by the Lodis

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
[Guest]: by the local chieftains the Rajput

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
[Guest]: chieftains and he can't even count on his own

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
[Guest]: brothers you know so in desperation

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000
[Guest]: at one point you would think okay who is he

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000
[Guest]: going to send to parlay with Kamran

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
[Guest]: maybe it is some you know

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
[Guest]: grizzled warrior maybe some you know

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
[Guest]: old man who holds a lot of respect

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
[Guest]: no he sends this elderly lady

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
[Guest]: Khansada Begum who is you know

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
[Guest]: who doesn't have independent status

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
[Guest]: of her own it's not that she has a

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
[Guest]: famous husband or famous son you know as

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
[Guest]: you know she was twice widowed and then married to

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
[Guest]: somebody not terribly

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
[Guest]: consequential but she

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
[Guest]: has this standing of her own

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
[Guest]: because they respect her so much you know because

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
[Guest]: she is a timid who is clearly

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
[Guest]: very intelligent they all look up to

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000
[Guest]: her she is sensible and she is

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
[Guest]: this woman who is sent on a very dangerous

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
[Guest]: mission across icy passes

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000
[Guest]: and mountains and you know she could have died

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
[Guest]: at any moment and she goes to Kamran

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
[Guest]: and she tells him do what Babur

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
[Guest]: would have wanted you to do so

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
[Guest]: she stands in lieu of Babur

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000
[Guest]: the founder himself and says remember

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
[Guest]: what Babur would have wanted you to do

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
[Guest]: that Humayun is like your Patshah now he is

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
[Guest]: like your elder brother he is like your king you must

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
[Guest]: obey him now

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
[Guest]: the fact that Kamran doesn't really do that is

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
[Guest]: neither here nor there because he was intent

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
[Guest]: on getting the throne for himself

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
[Guest]: but he listens to her with respect you know

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
[Guest]: and then he keeps her with him and says

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
[Guest]: you stay with me because you are

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
[Guest]: symbolically very important but the

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
[Guest]: fact that she is sent on these missions shows

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
[Guest]: that when all else fails when there is nothing

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
[Guest]: left they still believe in the

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000
[Guest]: power of somebody like Khanzada

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
[Guest]: on the power that she has through her charisma

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
[Guest]: of being a timid woman

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
[Guest]: you know independent of any man really

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
[Guest]: and I find that really just

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
[Amit Varma]: startling and amazing

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
[Guest]: just a moral authority she carries

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000
[Amit Varma]: that's right

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000
[Amit Varma]: does it strike you sometimes when you are studying history or writing history

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
[Amit Varma]: how important and

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
[Amit Varma]: consequential happenstance can become

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
[Amit Varma]: like not just for example the happenstance of

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
[Amit Varma]: that we happen to find the only

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
[Amit Varma]: biography of Gulbadan but

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
[Amit Varma]: even happenstance in history for example

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000
[Amit Varma]: you write about

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
[Amit Varma]: how Humayun falls in love with this young

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000
[Amit Varma]: girl called Hamida Banu Begum

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and she is really not interested

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
[Amit Varma]: and one of his foster mothers

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000
[Amit Varma]: Dildar Begum is then playing its part

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
[Amit Varma]: trying to get her to convince and saying

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000
[Amit Varma]: what better than you know marrying a

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
[Amit Varma]: king and he is not really a king at the moment

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
[Unknown]: he is a fugitive he is kind of running around

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
[Unknown]: with this small retinue and she is like

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
[Unknown]: you know trying to politely turn

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
[Unknown]: it down and it's all very interesting but

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
[Amit Varma]: it actually happens

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
[Amit Varma]: and you know and from there

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
[Amit Varma]: even when they are sort of

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
[Amit Varma]: going back to the present day

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
[Unknown]: Afghanistan side and

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
[Amit Varma]: it's news that another of his brothers

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
[Amit Varma]: might kill him and Humayun and

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
[Amit Varma]: Hamida go off and they leave little baby

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Akbar with wet nurses

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
[Amit Varma]: and somehow he survives all of that and

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
[Amit Varma]: if these things don't happen we don't have Akbar

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
[Amit Varma]: we don't have I mean the

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
[Amit Varma]: history of the subcontinent is completely

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
[Guest]: different completely different of course

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
[Guest]: if you read again if you read Abu Al-Fazl

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
[Guest]: and the male biographers then you will be told

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
[Guest]: that this is all predetermined and this

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
[Guest]: was meant to be and it is because Akbar

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
[Guest]: is a semi-divine king and it is all

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
[Guest]: stars you know so they go back to astrology

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
[Guest]: and they say that

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
[Guest]: the stars were aligned in just such a manner

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
[Guest]: that this would happen but of course

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
[Guest]: we know that it is as you

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
[Guest]: say happenstance and it is fortuitous

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
[Guest]: incidents like this you know and

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
[Guest]: in fact the fact that Hamida Banu

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
[Guest]: went with Humayun for two years they were

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
[Guest]: in Persia and you know they were almost

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
[Guest]: like itinerant backpackers because

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
[Guest]: they had nothing much at all you know they

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
[Guest]: had 40 total the retinue

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
[Guest]: when they went left India was 40

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
[Guest]: so that is not a very impressive cavalcade

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
[Guest]: you know when you are coming as the Badshah of

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
[Guest]: Hindustan and of course they are received

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
[Guest]: in Persia and

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
[Guest]: they are treated as kings

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
[Guest]: and queens but

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
[Guest]: the fact is that they spend most of those

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
[Guest]: two years just sightseeing

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
[Guest]: and they visit all these wonderful, Humayun is

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
[Guest]: an interesting character himself and

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
[Guest]: he visits all these interesting

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
[Guest]: you know sites and all this amazing

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
[Guest]: architecture, Persia is an amazing place

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
[Guest]: at that time

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
[Guest]: one of the you know cauldrons of

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
[Guest]: culture really in the world

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
[Guest]: and so they see all this amazing site

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
[Guest]: and Hamida Banu with him, they see carpets

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
[Guest]: they see architecture

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
[Guest]: they eat food which is amazing

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
[Guest]: also you know they talk about sharbat

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
[Guest]: cooled with ice water and you know this amazing

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
[Guest]: white linen and white bread which is made for

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
[Guest]: them and it is so evocative

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
[Guest]: and one wonders when they come back two years

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
[Guest]: later how much Hamida Banu

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
[Guest]: brings with her because she has seen all this

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
[Guest]: she has eaten all this, she has experienced all this

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
[Guest]: and when Gulbadan writes that

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
[Guest]: a new fashion of making tents

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
[Guest]: of arranging quarters

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
[Guest]: was introduced, then you think

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
[Guest]: okay maybe Hamida Banu Begum

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
[Guest]: introduced certain Persian

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
[Guest]: ways into Hindustan

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
[Guest]: and that is the way through which

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
[Guest]: it came, it's not just Humayun

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
[Guest]: it's not just the Persian immigrants

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
[Guest]: who then followed, it is Hamida Banu herself

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
[Guest]: and in fact

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
[Guest]: one of the

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
[Guest]: questions I bring up is the whole

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
[Guest]: question of who built Humayun's tomb

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
[Guest]: for something which became such an important

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
[Guest]: mausoleum, the mausoleum of the

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
[Guest]: Mughals themselves, it was

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
[Guest]: very little written about in its own time

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
[Guest]: I think people were too busy establishing

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
[Guest]: the empire, Akbar was very young at that time

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
[Guest]: he was still fighting for the throne when Humayun

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
[Guest]: died and the

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
[Guest]: Humayun's tomb was only begun several years

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
[Guest]: after his death, much later

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
[Guest]: and Akbar then moved to Agra

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
[Guest]: and then Fatehpur Sikhi and that became

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
[Guest]: the focus of his attention, so

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
[Guest]: Humayun's tomb in Delhi was not much

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
[Guest]: written about, so there's quite a lot of

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
[Guest]: question mark about who built Humayun's

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
[Guest]: tomb, you know, and

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
[Guest]: contemporary writers say

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
[Guest]: that it was his widow, so his

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
[Guest]: widow being Bega Begum who's also another

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
[Guest]: very interesting woman

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
[Guest]: and I wonder if the very

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
[Guest]: shape of Humayun's tomb which shows so much

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
[Guest]: Persian influence, perhaps

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
[Guest]: some of it comes from the fact that Bega Begum

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
[Guest]: would have talked to Hamida Banu Begum

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
[Guest]: her wife who she was very friendly with, they had

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
[Guest]: a very good relationship according to

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
[Guest]: how Gulbuddin writes about it, they may

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
[Guest]: have compared notes, she may have talked about the

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
[Guest]: mausoleums that she visited in her two years

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
[Guest]: in Persia and some of them, of course this

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
[Guest]: is all far-fetched and this is again, you know

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
[Guest]: wondering, but it's a wondering

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
[Guest]: which is worth doing, that perhaps

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
[Guest]: they talked about it, she talked about these things

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
[Guest]: and then along with the Persian architect, there was

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
[Guest]: a Persian architect, this wonderful

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
[Guest]: tomb was built and Bega Begum

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
[Guest]: then looked after it for the rest of her life

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
[Guest]: and yet certain people now

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
[Guest]: certain scholars will say that Akbar built it

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
[Guest]: I think what the question is

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
[Guest]: is who determines ownership

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
[Guest]: how do you determine ownership of a

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
[Guest]: thing, a monument? It may be

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
[Guest]: money, Akbar must have supplied most of the money

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
[Guest]: he was the emperor and he had a lot of money

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
[Guest]: certainly, but isn't it also

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
[Guest]: the person who has loved it

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
[Guest]: who has loved it into being

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
[Guest]: who has brought in some of the ideas, who

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
[Guest]: spent the rest of her life looking after it

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
[Guest]: and who has devoted herself

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
[Guest]: to that tomb, so in my chapter

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
[Guest]: on that, I say, let us not

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
[Guest]: take away ownership, people in

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
[Guest]: that time said, Bega Begum built

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
[Guest]: Humayun's tomb, you see, so let us not

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
[Guest]: take it away so easily because

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
[Guest]: these examples are not lying thick on the ground

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
[Guest]: of women doing things, so we must hang on

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
[Guest]: to each instance that we have and fight

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
[Amit Varma]: for it. And it's very tempting for male historians

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
[Amit Varma]: to just imagine that if anything

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
[Amit Varma]: great exists, like a great monument

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
[Unknown]: it's obviously a man

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
[Amit Varma]: and one of the concrete things

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
[Amit Varma]: which did come

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
[Amit Varma]: from Persia is of course

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
[Amit Varma]: the whole art of the Mughal miniature

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
[Amit Varma]: really originated there because

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
[Amit Varma]: they got painters back from there

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
[Amit Varma]: and they were completely enthralled

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
[Amit Varma]: by the work that happened there

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
[Amit Varma]: and that cultural influence came in

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
[Amit Varma]: from there. We'll take a quick commercial

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
[Amit Varma]: break and when we come back, we move

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
[Amit Varma]: on to the second period of

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:28.000
[Unknown]: The Great Mughal Era.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
[Unknown]: We're just trying to get some additional information

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
[Unknown]: that will help us get more advertisers

01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:20.000
[Unknown]: on board.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
[Unknown]: Speaking of shows, on Mr. & Mrs. Binge Watch

[Unknown]: new teen drama series, Euphoria

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
[Unknown]: Utsav talks about his trip to Turkey with his

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
[Unknown]: friends and how you can curate your travel

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
[Unknown]: to make them the most fun and memorable experiences.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
[Unknown]: On our Kannada Podcast, Thalle Harate

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
[Unknown]: Satya Sankaran joins Pawan Srinath

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
[Unknown]: to talk about how non-motorized transport

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
[Unknown]: needs new thinking, behavior, policy,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
[Unknown]: infrastructure, action and more.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
[Unknown]: On The Origin of Things, Chuck narrates an interesting story

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
[Unknown]: about a Brazilian company that struggled its way

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
[Unknown]: through World War II and the Great Depression.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
[Unknown]: And with that, let's get you on with your show.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Seen and The Unseen.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Ira Mukherjee

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
[Amit Varma]: about her wonderful book Daughters of the Sun

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
[Amit Varma]: and we've just finished talking

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
[Amit Varma]: about the ladies and the

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
[Amit Varma]: lives of Babur and Humayun.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
[Amit Varma]: And I'm almost feeling embarrassed

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
[Amit Varma]: having to say the ladies and the lives of Babur

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
[Guest]: and Humayun, you know, making the same mistake

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
[Guest]: that historians... Good, good.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
[Guest]: Self-awareness is the beginning.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I guess.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Early on in your book, you say that

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, when you look at the women in this period,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
[Amit Varma]: it can sort of be divided

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
[Amit Varma]: into three phases. That with the

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
[Amit Varma]: early Mughals, you have the older

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
[Amit Varma]: matriarchs who are really powerful

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
[Amit Varma]: people like Khanzada and I guess Zildar

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
[Amit Varma]: and so on. And Akbar

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
[Amit Varma]: onwards, the focus shifts first

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
[Amit Varma]: to foster mothers, I guess, in that

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
[Amit Varma]: immediate period where he's settling down.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And then to wives. Yes. And then

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
[Amit Varma]: with the later Mughals, it shifts to

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
[Amit Varma]: like unmarried daughters. That's right.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
[Amit Varma]: And is it sort of just happenstance or are there

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
[Amit Varma]: deeper reasons behind this kind of a

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
[Amit Varma]: shift and the kind of women

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
[Guest]: who are becoming dominant? Well,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
[Guest]: I think initially the

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
[Guest]: matriarchs were important because

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
[Guest]: they were the ones carrying that culture.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
[Guest]: So they were the ones who had the moral authority.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
[Guest]: They were the ones who had that clout. They were the

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
[Guest]: ones who had that influence, you know, and respect.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
[Guest]: The younger women were not

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
[Guest]: at that point that needed,

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
[Guest]: you know, you needed the older women who had that

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
[Guest]: authority with them, which the younger women

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
[Guest]: didn't have. And therefore, the

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
[Guest]: Babur and Humayun were particularly

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
[Guest]: respectful of these older women.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
[Guest]: All the Mughals were right down the line,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
[Guest]: but the ones who had that visibility,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
[Guest]: let us say, are the older women.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
[Guest]: Because I think they, at a time of very

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
[Guest]: great uncertainty, of vulnerability of the

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
[Guest]: empire, they are the ones who brought

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
[Guest]: that sort of counterpart

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
[Guest]: and that weight and that culture

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
[Guest]: with them. Then

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
[Guest]: Akbar, in his early years,

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
[Guest]: because as we know, he was abandoned as a

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
[Guest]: baby, and I think probably that is one reason

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
[Guest]: for those few years before his parents

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
[Guest]: came back, but the entire time of 10 years

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
[Guest]: in Kabul, he was surrounded

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
[Guest]: by his foster families.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
[Guest]: And I think that possibly shaped

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
[Guest]: him very deeply.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
[Guest]: He may have somewhere

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
[Guest]: felt that whereas his parents had

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
[Guest]: abandoned him, his foster families

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
[Guest]: stood by him, protected him

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
[Guest]: physically, from his uncle Kamran,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
[Guest]: who was always a slightly volatile

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
[Guest]: character, from Askari,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
[Guest]: and from all the dangers around

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
[Guest]: a child, a baby, you know.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
[Guest]: So I have a feeling that these years shaped

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
[Guest]: him so that he had this love,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
[Guest]: this affection, and

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
[Guest]: this gratitude to his foster families

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
[Guest]: throughout his life, so that his

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
[Guest]: foster brothers could get

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
[Guest]: away almost with murder and he forgave

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
[Guest]: them, like Aziz Koka could say all kinds

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
[Guest]: of cheeky and disrespectful things to him in the

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
[Guest]: open court, and Akbar would

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
[Guest]: mostly laugh it off or shrug it off, you know,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
[Amit Varma]: make light of it. In fact, he very memorably

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
[Guest]: said that there is a river of milk between

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
[Amit Varma]: us. That is right. He so poetically said that.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
[Guest]: Such a beautiful phrase. Such a beautiful phrase, exactly right.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
[Guest]: And so, you know,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
[Guest]: he was very, very grateful

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
[Guest]: I think to his foster families and his foster

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
[Guest]: mothers, therefore. And the

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
[Guest]: one who

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
[Guest]: was most ambitious, let us say,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
[Guest]: was Mahamanga. There were

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
[Guest]: others that he loved perhaps more, like Jiji

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
[Guest]: Anga, Aziz Koka's mother,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
[Guest]: but she was not ambitious in that sense.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
[Guest]: She was always there with Akbar, but

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
[Guest]: I don't find any records of her

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
[Guest]: doing anything of her own

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
[Guest]: in terms of architecture or commissioning

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
[Guest]: anything, but Mahamanga was.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
[Guest]: She was an ambitious woman, she was a talented woman,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
[Guest]: so was her son, but he was again very volatile,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
[Guest]: Adham Khan. And

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
[Guest]: Mahamanga, so therefore at the

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
[Guest]: time of the early years of

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
[Guest]: Akbar, when he hasn't yet come into his

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
[Guest]: own, when he is in the force of nature that

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
[Guest]: we later know him to be, Mahamanga

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
[Guest]: is very, very powerful and

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
[Guest]: it is written that she practically

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
[Guest]: ran the empire for those two years

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
[Guest]: until Adham Khan

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
[Guest]: oversteps the boundaries and therefore

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
[Guest]: Mahamanga also falls.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
[Guest]: So, we have that short period of time

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
[Guest]: in which there are the foster mothers

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
[Guest]: and it is short, but it is not inconsequential

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
[Guest]: because she carries out many orders,

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
[Guest]: she runs the empire and she builds

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
[Guest]: one of the first great mosques,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
[Guest]: Mughal mosques of Delhi, which is today

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
[Guest]: completely forgotten. It's the Kherul Manazil

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
[Guest]: Madrasa and mosque complex

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
[Guest]: which is opposite Old Fort

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
[Guest]: and today it is in ruins sadly,

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
[Guest]: but it is a wonderful testament of a

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
[Guest]: non-royal Mughal woman

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
[Guest]: and it is clearly written, there's a

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
[Guest]: writing on it in Persian

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
[Guest]: saying that this has been commissioned by

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
[Guest]: Mahamanga. So, she's put her name to it.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
[Guest]: You see her ambition, you see her desire

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
[Guest]: for her name to continue

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
[Guest]: in posterity. And so,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
[Guest]: after these short years, once the

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
[Guest]: matriarchs die out, they stay out

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
[Guest]: for quite a long time, Hamida Banu and

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
[Guest]: Gulbadan, Bega Begum dies

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
[Guest]: first, but there's Gulbadan and there's Hamida Banu,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
[Guest]: they continue. Because Hamida Banu

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
[Guest]: was so young when she got

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
[Guest]: married and she had Akbar, she died

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
[Guest]: only a couple of years before her son.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
[Guest]: So, almost his entire life, he

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
[Guest]: had these matriarchs who remained very

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
[Guest]: powerful and visible

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
[Guest]: despite Abu Al-Fazl's attempt

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
[Guest]: to make them invisible. So, Gulbadan

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
[Guest]: goes on this wonderful all-women's hajj

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
[Guest]: which is a remarkable thing for a

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
[Guest]: 16th century Muslim woman to do. And

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
[Guest]: she spends a full seven years

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
[Guest]: before she comes back to Fatehpur Sikhi.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
[Guest]: So, one imagines the kind of adventure that

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
[Guest]: she goes through and how much she must have

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
[Guest]: enjoyed herself to have stayed away from

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
[Amit Varma]: this opulent court. And you described

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
[Amit Varma]: even when they came back, she didn't go directly

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
[Amit Varma]: from the shore to the, you know, she's

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
[Guest]: going everywhere and really chilling with her.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
[Guest]: Exactly. You would think if she really wanted to get

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
[Guest]: back, she'd rush back home. But she first goes

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
[Guest]: to Ajmer to see the Dargah, you know, she does

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
[Guest]: all the other minor pilgrimages.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
[Guest]: So, she's clearly having the time of her

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
[Guest]: life, you know. And what a pity that she

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
[Guest]: hasn't written about that.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
[Guest]: So, yes. So, there are these

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
[Guest]: matriarchs who remain influential

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
[Guest]: almost till the end of Akbar's

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
[Guest]: life. So, we don't hear

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
[Guest]: a great deal about the other

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
[Guest]: women at this time. It is only after he

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
[Guest]: passes away that one hears more

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
[Guest]: about the power of his mother,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
[Guest]: Harkabai, the Rajput princess of

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
[Guest]: Ajmer, who is, of course, in popular

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
[Guest]: literature misrepresented as

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
[Guest]: Jodhabai in Jodha Akbar. That is completely

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
[Guest]: untrue. She was not from Jodhpur. She was

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
[Guest]: from Ajmer, which became Jaipur later

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
[Guest]: on. So,

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
[Guest]: it is only after Akbar passes away that

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
[Guest]: you see that Harkabai is a very

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
[Guest]: powerful, financially independent woman.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
[Guest]: She has her own trading ships. She's

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
[Guest]: very interested in trade.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
[Guest]: In fact, it even brings her up against the Portuguese

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
[Guest]: who are a real menace and whom she loathes.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
[Guest]: And so did all the women. In fact, the

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
[Guest]: harem was very anti the Jesuit

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
[Guest]: missionaries. They found them

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
[Guest]: a nefarious and toxic influence

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
[Guest]: and they hated, obviously,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
[Guest]: the things that they said against

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
[Guest]: both the Muslims and the Hindus.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
[Guest]: In that way, they were quite democratic. They would criticize

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
[Guest]: both the Hindus and the Muslims.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
[Guest]: So, both Harkabai and her retinue of Rajput

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
[Guest]: women hated them and so did the Muslim

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
[Guest]: ladies. They were like, who are these men

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
[Guest]: telling us

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
[Guest]: how to live our life?

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
[Guest]: So, it is only after Akbar died that

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
[Guest]: you see the power of Harkabai.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
[Guest]: So, she trades and she has

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
[Guest]: interactions with the Portuguese

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
[Guest]: and she has even

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
[Guest]: a proxy fight with them.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
[Guest]: But she's a powerful woman. We only

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
[Guest]: see that later on, for that short period

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
[Guest]: of time until she passes away.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
[Guest]: And then the wives come into their own with

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
[Guest]: Nur Jahan, of course, famously.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
[Guest]: And it is later, in the time of

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
[Guest]: Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, that the

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
[Guest]: daughters become more powerful.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
[Guest]: And I think it's because the daughters

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
[Guest]: now are carrying that bloodline.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
[Guest]: They are the timid women because the wives are local

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
[Guest]: wives now. They are Hindustani wives, non-timid

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
[Guest]: wives. So, they do not carry that

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
[Guest]: charisma of the timid

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
[Guest]: which is necessary to perpetuate this

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
[Guest]: legacy. So, it is the daughters who take on

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
[Guest]: that role. Jahanara Begum is a timid

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
[Guest]: woman and she claims that legacy

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
[Guest]: very forcefully. And I found that is

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
[Guest]: what attracted me to her.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
[Guest]: Just like the men did. In fact, almost

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
[Guest]: more than the men did. She said, I am a timid

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
[Guest]: woman. I will build these

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
[Guest]: buildings. She built so many structures

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
[Guest]: in Old Delhi.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
[Guest]: She wrote biographies.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
[Guest]: She was a Sufi peer. She had

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
[Guest]: a Sufi journey. She wrote about that in her

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
[Guest]: biography. And she does all this

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
[Guest]: claiming that she is blessed

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
[Guest]: and is perpetuating the timid lamp,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
[Guest]: the knowledge of the timid. So, that

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
[Guest]: is very important. It is because of her bloodline

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
[Guest]: that she is able to claim this

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
[Guest]: sort of descendants and legacy.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
[Guest]: So, that is why the daughters then become

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
[Guest]: important. As does Roshanara.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
[Guest]: But she is just...

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
[Guest]: One of the Europeans, I forget, Bernier,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
[Guest]: somebody wrote acutely but cruelly

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
[Guest]: that she is also very beautiful but

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
[Guest]: less beautiful than Jahanara. She is also talented

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
[Guest]: but less than Jahanara. So, she was always

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
[Guest]: second best. But these

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
[Guest]: women were powerful. They were incredibly

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
[Guest]: wealthy. All the Europeans who wanted

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
[Guest]: to trade at court had to

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
[Guest]: parlay with them

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
[Guest]: and had to interact with them and they

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
[Guest]: ignored them at their own peril.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
[Guest]: I think one of them, Thomas Rowe, first thought

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
[Guest]: that he would do without Jahanara Begum

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
[Guest]: and it worked out

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
[Guest]: very badly and he had to scramble later on

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
[Guest]: to make up for that. So, these women,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
[Guest]: Noor Jahan, Jahanara and Roshanara

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
[Guest]: were very influential later on.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
[Amit Varma]: One of the things that struck me about

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
[Amit Varma]: Akbar's times,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
[Amit Varma]: in fact, two of the fundamental shifts that happened

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
[Amit Varma]: and one was sort of a cultural shift

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that he was marrying a lot of

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Rajput women in alliances

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
[Amit Varma]: And that had an influence. Like in just one

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
[Amit Varma]: context, you write, quote,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
[Amit Varma]: In just a few years, this Rajasthani

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
[Amit Varma]: style will irrevocably

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
[Amit Varma]: influence Mughal court dress and etiquette.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
[Amit Varma]: Tight jackets and tunics and diaphanous

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
[Amit Varma]: materials elaborately printed

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
[Amit Varma]: will replace the more pragmatic flowing

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
[Amit Varma]: kabhas of the Mughal women.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
[Amit Varma]: But it's not just in dress.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
[Amit Varma]: In every possible way,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
[Guest]: it had an influence on the court.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
[Guest]: It did. It had an influence

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
[Guest]: which was, I think, both ways.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
[Guest]: More than we acknowledge.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
[Guest]: The Rajputs

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
[Guest]: obviously adopted a great deal

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
[Guest]: from the Mughals, from their culture.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
[Guest]: The miniature paintings went to the minor courts

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
[Guest]: of Rajasthan and they flourished

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
[Guest]: when Akbar commissioned the

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
[Guest]: Razam Namas, which was a translation of the Mahabharata.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
[Guest]: This extraordinary document which

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
[Guest]: required Brahmin priests

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
[Guest]: sitting together with Persian theologians

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
[Guest]: and writers and translators

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
[Guest]: and all this amazing intellectual work

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
[Guest]: going on so that the Mahabharata, this

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
[Guest]: amazing Sanskrit script was translated

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
[Guest]: into Persian.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
[Guest]: When the Rajputs saw this, they also commissioned one.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
[Guest]: They said we will be no less and they commissioned one

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
[Guest]: which had twice the number of paintings that the Mughals had.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
[Guest]: So you see, they were very much influenced

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
[Guest]: as well and they took all these

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
[Guest]: elements back to their court, whether it was

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
[Guest]: in architecture, the paintings

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
[Guest]: and of course the Mughals were completely

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
[Guest]: altered by the interaction with the Rajputs.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
[Guest]: Definitely in art,

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
[Guest]: and you can see in Fatehpur Sikri

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
[Guest]: this mixing of styles, Gujarati, Rajasthani,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
[Guest]: you know, Timurid of course.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
[Guest]: It was very much because

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
[Guest]: of Rajasthan, but the interesting thing

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
[Guest]: that I have also

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
[Guest]: talked about and I'm talking about more in my

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
[Guest]: next book is the way

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
[Guest]: they were influenced in terms of the

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
[Guest]: women's life and the purdah

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
[Guest]: specifically. We normally tend to assume

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
[Guest]: that the purdah came with the Mughals,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
[Guest]: that they brought it with them from Central Asia

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
[Guest]: into India and I'm wondering

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
[Guest]: if it is not more a sort of

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
[Guest]: a two-way thing

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
[Guest]: that when they came in, they seemed to

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
[Guest]: have, as I said, a very porous purdah

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
[Guest]: indeed. Many of the women were visible, they had a very

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
[Guest]: light purdah, they were on horseback, they travelled

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
[Guest]: everywhere, they talked to the men openly,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
[Guest]: you know, they interacted with them in mixed gatherings.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
[Guest]: But this purdah that happened

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
[Guest]: happened more at Akbar's time

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
[Guest]: and we know that Rajasthani

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
[Guest]: Rajput society at this time

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
[Guest]: had a purdah system which

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
[Guest]: was extremely intransigent

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
[Guest]: and their women were very much cloistered

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
[Guest]: in fact the higher up in the echelon

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
[Guest]: they were, the higher were the walls

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
[Guest]: physically of their, you know, of their zanana.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
[Guest]: So even light could not enter.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
[Guest]: Their purdah

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
[Guest]: was so restrictive that they were meant to cover

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
[Guest]: their heads even in front of senior women.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
[Guest]: So their mothers-in-law, for many years a young

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
[Guest]: bride could not cover, uncover her face

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
[Guest]: whereas the Mughals never had any such thing,

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
[Guest]: they interacted freely with other women.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
[Guest]: So I am wondering whether

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
[Guest]: this is not also something which the Rajputs

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
[Guest]: brought with them which became

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
[Guest]: something that Akbar then thought would be

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
[Guest]: good to emulate because these are high caste

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
[Guest]: Rajput men who are introducing this system

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
[Guest]: therefore it is something that he

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
[Guest]: as a Mughal emperor should also bring

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
[Guest]: into his harem, you know, as Patshah of India.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
[Guest]: And perhaps a two-way thing,

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
[Guest]: perhaps the Rajasthanis then saw

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
[Guest]: how the empire was

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
[Guest]: forming, how the court was becoming more

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
[Guest]: ossified and more stratified,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
[Guest]: how the harem was becoming tighter, the zanana

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
[Guest]: was higher and they brought even more

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
[Guest]: restriction to their women so that

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
[Guest]: by the end of it both societies

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
[Guest]: have their women tightly cloistered

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
[Guest]: and invisible in a way.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
[Guest]: So yes, the interaction with

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
[Guest]: Rajasthan, with the Rajput culture

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
[Guest]: is something which I think has become

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
[Guest]: so organic that it would be difficult

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
[Guest]: to say where the Mughal starts and where the Rajput ends.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
[Amit Varma]: And what you also pointed out in your book,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
[Amit Varma]: the second big shift perhaps is that

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
[Amit Varma]: now the zanana becomes something

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of separate

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
[Amit Varma]: where Akbar starts spending more and more time

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
[Amit Varma]: with men whether they are, you know,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
[Unknown]: theologians or artists or whatever

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
[Amit Varma]: and the zanana becomes a separate thing

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
[Amit Varma]: and it raises a management problem. Again, to quote

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
[Amit Varma]: from your book, you write, quote

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
[Amit Varma]: the very large number of women now in Akbar

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
[Amit Varma]: zanana has brought up a very

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
[Amit Varma]: vexatious question even for a great statesman

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
[Amit Varma]: such as Akbar. This troublesome question

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
[Amit Varma]: is though it is only through

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
[Amit Varma]: order that the world becomes a meadow of

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
[Amit Varma]: truth and reality, this order

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
[Amit Varma]: yearningly aspired to by Abu al-Fazl

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
[Amit Varma]: for Akbar is hard to maintain in the

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
[Amit Varma]: raucous community of women, children,

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
[Amit Varma]: staff, relatives, guards, tutors

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
[Amit Varma]: and assorted entourage

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
[Amit Varma]: that Akbar zanana has become.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
[Guest]: Stop quote.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
[Guest]: How does he handle this?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
[Guest]: Well, first we have to

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
[Guest]: consider what Abu al-Fazl is saying.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
[Guest]: Abu al-Fazl states

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
[Guest]: that Akbar has 5000 women

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
[Guest]: in his zanana. Now anybody who has visited

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
[Guest]: Fatehpur Sikri will know that this is a gross

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
[Guest]: exaggeration. You would be

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
[Guest]: absolutely like sardines in a can if there were

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
[Guest]: 5000 women in what were

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
[Guest]: pretty modest

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
[Guest]: quarters if you're talking about

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
[Guest]: a sum like 5000. He says

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
[Guest]: 5000 to aggrandize Akbar.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
[Guest]: He says 5000 to show

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
[Guest]: how mighty Akbar is, that he can

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
[Guest]: provide for and protect 5000

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
[Guest]: women, that he requires 5000 women

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
[Guest]: around him in his zanana.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
[Guest]: So it is a gross exaggeration.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
[Guest]: The Europeans talk about

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
[Guest]: 300 women. Even there we're not

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
[Guest]: talking about 300 wives at all.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
[Guest]: So there's always this

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
[Guest]: assumption that these 5000 women are

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
[Guest]: sexually available to Akbar. They're his wives.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
[Guest]: This is complete nonsense.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
[Guest]: If you do the calculations, Akbar would

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
[Guest]: have done nothing but spend time with his wives

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
[Guest]: if he had 5000 women. How would he have

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
[Guest]: founded this amazing empire?

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
[Guest]: Firstly, one has to look at

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
[Guest]: what Abu al-Fazl is saying.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
[Guest]: Even considering the fact that there were not

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
[Guest]: 5000 women, there were a lot of women

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
[Guest]: because now all these Rajasthani ladies

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
[Guest]: brought their retinues

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
[Guest]: with them. And this is one thing that the Rajputs

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
[Guest]: did is that when they sent out their daughters,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
[Guest]: they didn't just send them alone to

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
[Guest]: their in-laws. They sent them completely accompanied

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
[Guest]: because they did not trust the food,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
[Guest]: what they would get in their in-law

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
[Guest]: family. So they brought in all

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
[Guest]: their infrastructure with them.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
[Guest]: Whether they were priests, whether they were

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
[Guest]: masseuse, whether they were teachers, whether they were

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
[Guest]: pandits, these were all women. Interesting to know

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
[Guest]: the women were carrying on all these roles.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
[Guest]: So this structure that Abu al-Fazl

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
[Guest]: tries to create as being

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
[Guest]: extremely ordered must have been

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
[Guest]: something which was quite rambunctious and out of

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
[Guest]: control in a way if he has to keep saying that it was

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
[Guest]: a very chaste place and a very ordered place.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
[Guest]: But the fact is that it was managed.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
[Guest]: It was like a city in miniature.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
[Guest]: It was like a government in miniature. You had a daroga,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
[Guest]: you had somebody taking notes, somebody

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
[Guest]: who took accounts, somebody who

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
[Guest]: showed those accounts to the Patsha,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
[Guest]: who presented to the Patsha

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
[Guest]: all the requirements of the women. The women

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
[Guest]: would also make requests every day

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
[Guest]: for charity for poor women

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
[Guest]: they would support. Those requests

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
[Guest]: were made before the emperor every afternoon.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
[Guest]: So there was this very complicated

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
[Guest]: and intrinsic bureaucracy and

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
[Guest]: life which was going on in the Zainana

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
[Guest]: which was not at all

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
[Guest]: the one that Abu al-Fazl was

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
[Guest]: hoping to create. It was something

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
[Guest]: that we have forgotten because of the sanitized way

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
[Guest]: that he talks about it. But it was

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
[Guest]: a very lively place. It was a place

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
[Guest]: where a great deal

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
[Guest]: of power was exercised by the women

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
[Guest]: and where they managed in many

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
[Guest]: ways to escape this veil

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
[Guest]: in one way or the other, you know,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
[Guest]: despite the attempts by Abu al-Fazl

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
[Amit Varma]: to keep them constrained.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, at one point you write after Gulbadan comes back

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
[Amit Varma]: from the Hajj, you write, stop quote,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
[Amit Varma]: the Zainana at Fatehpur secreted Gulbadan

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
[Amit Varma]: returns to in 1582 is very

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
[Amit Varma]: different from the Haramana for wandering with Humayun.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
[Amit Varma]: The great tented mobile cities

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
[Amit Varma]: have disappeared, replaced by the

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
[Amit Varma]: sandstone and marble walls and palaces

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
[Amit Varma]: of Akbar Zainana. Stop quote.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
[Amit Varma]: But what is happening here, interestingly,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
[Amit Varma]: is that even though these women are

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
[Amit Varma]: largely being kept separate and the whole

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
[Amit Varma]: management has changed that

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
[Amit Varma]: the matriarchs that remain are still

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
[Amit Varma]: very influential in politics

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
[Amit Varma]: and political manners

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
[Amit Varma]: matters, for example, how they help

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
[Unknown]: Saleem, whom we later

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
[Guest]: know as Jahangir come to power.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
[Guest]: Tell me a little bit. So it's

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
[Guest]: interesting that though on the one

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
[Guest]: hand we are told by many writers and

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
[Guest]: many Europeans that this was a place of gossip

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
[Guest]: and intrigue and backbiting and you know

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
[Guest]: jealousies among the women.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
[Guest]: I find that actually they were very

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
[Guest]: united in their cause, these women.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
[Guest]: And when they supported a prince, it was usually

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
[Guest]: everyone together. When they

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
[Guest]: tried to get somebody

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
[Guest]: thrown out of court or out of

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
[Guest]: favor, it was all together. Whether it was

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
[Guest]: the Jesuit missionaries who eventually had to go

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
[Guest]: and they attribute their fault

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
[Guest]: to the fact that the wives

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
[Guest]: and women of Akbar were against them.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
[Guest]: So they were very powerful and they

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
[Guest]: seemed very united in their cause.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
[Guest]: And Saleem was a great example

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
[Guest]: of that. He was a complicated

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
[Guest]: prince who had a complicated

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
[Guest]: relationship with a very

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
[Guest]: powerful father. So this father-son

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
[Guest]: dynamic was something which was difficult to

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
[Guest]: navigate for him, you know. And I think

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
[Guest]: he often relied on the support of the

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
[Guest]: women. And at one point, I think in

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
[Guest]: open court, I think it was Salima Sultan

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
[Guest]: Begum from behind the jali, she says

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
[Guest]: you know Pacha, we have something to say to you

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
[Guest]: and if you don't come to us, we will

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
[Guest]: come to you. So I found that really

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
[Guest]: funny. I was like, this is a threat. They are saying

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
[Guest]: that they are going to come out in open court

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
[Guest]: and create a scene if he doesn't come to them

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
[Guest]: and listen to their woes or whatever

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
[Guest]: a farmaish they want to make.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
[Guest]: And he goes. So

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
[Guest]: they were very united in their cause and

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
[Guest]: when they supported a prince, princes

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
[Guest]: really relied on this support

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
[Guest]: to get further and to get

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
[Guest]: gain of cause for whatever they

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
[Amit Varma]: wanted to achieve. And in the case of Saleem

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
[Amit Varma]: in fact, you know his estrangement

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
[Amit Varma]: was so severe that when Akbar sent

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Abu al-Fazl, he got Abu al-Fazl

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
[Amit Varma]: beheaded, which would not have made

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
[Amit Varma]: some of the women so unhappy, I imagine

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
[Amit Varma]: going by the histories

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
[Amit Varma]: that he eventually wrote.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
[Amit Varma]: But then Salima Sultan Begum

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
[Amit Varma]: steps in and she helps her father and the

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
[Guest]: son come together and then eventually

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
[Guest]: there is a rapprochement despite the one beheaded

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
[Guest]: friend of Akbar. Yes, one beheaded

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
[Guest]: friend, exactly. And it is

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
[Guest]: of course they wrote that we can only

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
[Guest]: imagine Akbar's, you know, great

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
[Guest]: disarray and distress at the death of

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
[Guest]: his great friend. So, to have

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
[Guest]: brought about this rapprochement when

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
[Guest]: Saleem has crossed such a

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
[Guest]: line and committed such a grave

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
[Guest]: error shows the influence of the

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
[Guest]: women that they were, despite that

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
[Guest]: and Salima Sultan Begum is sent out

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
[Guest]: to do this job, which is interesting because

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
[Guest]: on her own, well, Akbar

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
[Guest]: marries her but it almost seems to be

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
[Guest]: a marriage of convenience. They have no children

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
[Guest]: together and she is older to Akbar so maybe

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
[Guest]: he views her more as an older relative.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
[Guest]: But, so despite the fact that she has

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
[Guest]: no son of her own, no, you know,

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
[Guest]: independent status of her own,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
[Guest]: she has this respect and she is sent

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
[Guest]: to bring Saleem back

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
[Guest]: to influence Saleem also because he is

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
[Guest]: also of a mind to just create trouble

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
[Guest]: and to create his own court and

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
[Guest]: to challenge his father. She talks to him

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
[Guest]: and she brings gifts from his father and says, look

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
[Guest]: this elephant I am bringing from your

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
[Guest]: father that means, he means well

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
[Guest]: he is not out to harm you. And she

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
[Guest]: brings him to court and finally there is a

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
[Guest]: rapprochement between the two and Akbar does

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
[Amit Varma]: forgive Saleem for this heinous crime.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
[Amit Varma]: And besides all the remarkable women

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
[Amit Varma]: in your story, there is also a

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
[Amit Varma]: remarkable ship, which of course is

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
[Amit Varma]: Rahimi, which is

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Harkabai's ship or Maryam Uzmani

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
[Amit Varma]: as she was known. And I found this whole

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
[Amit Varma]: episode with Maryam Uzmani

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
[Amit Varma]: and Rahimi and what happens to Rahimi

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
[Amit Varma]: very fascinating because this

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
[Amit Varma]: is again one of those happenstance things that

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
[Amit Varma]: it kind of almost causes

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
[Amit Varma]: a decline in the fortunes of

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
[Unknown]: Portuguese colonialism.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
[Amit Varma]: This is a fascinating episode and Rahimi

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
[Amit Varma]: of course is described in this

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
[Amit Varma]: sentence that I found just

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
[Amit Varma]: lovely, which was described

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
[Amit Varma]: it as a Hindu Queen's Muslim ship

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
[Amit Varma]: carrying hutch pilgrims in Christian

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
[Amit Varma]: waters patrolled by the Portuguese

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
[Guest]: armada. Stop Guru. Yes.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
[Guest]: Tell me what happened here. Well, you know

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
[Guest]: it's amazing and it just shows the polyphony

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
[Guest]: and you know the multiplicity

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
[Guest]: of the court at this

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
[Guest]: time is that, so as I said

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
[Guest]: after Akbar passed away

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
[Guest]: we see more visibly that Harkabai is

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
[Guest]: a very powerful woman and she has

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
[Guest]: a ship in her own name who sails under

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
[Guest]: her colors, the Rahimi.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
[Guest]: So this is a hud ship

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
[Guest]: but the hud ships at the same time also

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
[Guest]: conducted trade.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
[Guest]: There was a lot of trade in the Indian

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
[Guest]: Ocean between India and the Middle

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
[Guest]: East and further still

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
[Guest]: from way back and it was the Portuguese who

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
[Guest]: started controlling this and they introduced

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
[Guest]: piracy and rapacity and you know they were

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
[Guest]: pretty brutal in their dealings with the Indian

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
[Guest]: ships. So they were loathed

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
[Guest]: by everybody. You know everybody was

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
[Guest]: agreed that the Portuguese we need to find

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
[Guest]: a way to get them out of Indian waters

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
[Guest]: because they only create trouble and

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
[Guest]: they also since their hutch pilgrims have been

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
[Guest]: carried there they used to also look for any

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
[Guest]: chance to trouble the

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
[Guest]: pilgrims you know and to torture them if they could.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
[Guest]: So Harkabai has

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
[Guest]: this ship called the Rahimi and

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
[Guest]: the Portuguese have introduced this system

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
[Guest]: because they do control the waters because of

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
[Guest]: superior naval power and they've brought

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
[Guest]: this system of the Kartaz which is

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
[Guest]: a pass that you have to have obtained

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
[Guest]: from the Portuguese authority to have your

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
[Guest]: ship sail. Now the Mughals

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
[Guest]: hate this because the Kartaz has a

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
[Guest]: picture of the Holy Mary

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
[Guest]: and they really hate the fact that

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
[Guest]: their pilgrims they're going to Mecca

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
[Guest]: having to carry this pass with you know Christian

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
[Guest]: symbols on it. So it is in many ways

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
[Guest]: you know a flexing of muscles

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
[Guest]: and showing strength and who must

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
[Guest]: obey which laws and

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
[Guest]: so Harkabai detests the

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
[Guest]: idea that she has to you know kowtow to them

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
[Guest]: and obtain this pass but they do

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
[Guest]: and despite that

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
[Guest]: the ship is seized and

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
[Guest]: Harkabai is really furious at this

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
[Guest]: and she says we must

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
[Guest]: stop all trade with the Portuguese if this is

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
[Guest]: the way that they're going to treat our ships

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
[Guest]: and until this point really

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
[Guest]: none of the Mughals had really

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
[Guest]: confronted the Portuguese. The Mughals

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
[Guest]: their vision was more turned to

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
[Guest]: the land. It was more to the agricultural

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
[Guest]: hinterland where all the money was

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
[Guest]: the produce was you know where the great harvests

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
[Guest]: of India were. They were not looking

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
[Guest]: so much outwards towards the

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
[Guest]: seas. They did have a navy

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
[Guest]: it was largely a river navy

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
[Guest]: you know so they sailed the rivers

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
[Guest]: not so much the high seas.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
[Guest]: So they had not really come into confrontation

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
[Guest]: not that they particularly want to

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
[Guest]: but when Harkabai made this demand

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
[Guest]: it effectively, now she never did

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
[Guest]: recover the Rahimi but it

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
[Guest]: effectively brought to an end

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
[Guest]: the great control that the Portuguese

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
[Guest]: had over the Indian waters and the English

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
[Guest]: are delighted because

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
[Guest]: they know that if the Portuguese are out and they've been

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
[Guest]: controlling the waters maybe it is the time of

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
[Guest]: the English finally and they write

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
[Guest]: with great delight and say the

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
[Guest]: Queen Mother is furious at the Portuguese

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
[Guest]: and this will spell the end

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
[Guest]: and in a way it did and so

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
[Guest]: happenstance again as you say

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
[Guest]: brought about this

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
[Guest]: this amazing

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
[Guest]: you know change in the politics

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
[Amit Varma]: of the waters. Do you sometimes get tempted

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
[Amit Varma]: just to forget about history's history

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
[Guest]: and write counterfactuals?

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's not even go there.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
[Guest]: That would also take you back to literature right?

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
[Guest]: That's right. Which you said was your first love.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
[Amit Varma]: The next character I want to talk about is

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Noor Jahan and she is

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
[Amit Varma]: really interesting because she has got

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
[Amit Varma]: really humble beginnings. Yes. She

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
[Amit Varma]: rises to great wealth even more than

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
[Unknown]: the emperor himself perhaps as you point out.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Yes. But she has a kind of an

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
[Guest]: enormous end. Yes.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
[Guest]: So Noor Jahan is a fascinating

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
[Guest]: character you know again

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
[Guest]: pretty poorly served by the

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
[Guest]: Europeans who always

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
[Guest]: imply that she holds the

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
[Guest]: emperor in sexual thrall so

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
[Guest]: it is a way a debasement of Jahangir

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
[Guest]: also and it is

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
[Guest]: you know they are showing her as this manipulative

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
[Guest]: sort of

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
[Guest]: virago type person you know which is doing her

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
[Guest]: a great disservice. As you say she

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
[Guest]: came as a refugee. Her family came as refugees

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
[Guest]: from Persia and they

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
[Guest]: came to Akbar's court and then they rose slowly

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
[Guest]: through the ranks. They were all very talented

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
[Guest]: whether it's her father who was prime minister, her

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
[Guest]: brother who controlled, who was very very

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
[Guest]: powerful, Noor Jahan herself.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
[Guest]: Not just powerful, very very

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
[Guest]: talented people. They did things in all

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
[Guest]: fields. Her mother developed attar of

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
[Guest]: roses for example you know. She just

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
[Guest]: collected the skum after boiling roses and

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
[Guest]: found this amazing fragrance.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
[Guest]: So they were a talented family

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
[Guest]: and she achieved a great deal

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
[Guest]: which Rubilal talks with

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
[Guest]: a great deal of authority. So I have not

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
[Guest]: written a great deal on

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
[Guest]: Noor Jahan because it is all there

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
[Guest]: in Rubilal's amazing book Empress

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
[Guest]: but what she says which is of interest to

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
[Guest]: me is the fact that we have

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
[Guest]: to see what Noor Jahan did

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
[Guest]: and see it in context

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
[Guest]: because in India we have a you know

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
[Guest]: history is taught in a sort of bullet point form

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
[Guest]: so we are told she shot lions,

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
[Guest]: she minted coins, she did this that and the

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
[Guest]: other. You learn all these four or five facts and you move

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
[Guest]: on to the next thing. But what you have to

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
[Guest]: realize is put in context

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
[Guest]: who shoots lions? Only

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
[Guest]: the Padshah. Nobody else is allowed to shoot

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
[Guest]: lions. It is a royal prerogative.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
[Guest]: Who mints coins? Only the Padshah.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
[Guest]: The Jharoka Darshan. Who sits

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
[Guest]: at the Jharoka and allows themselves

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
[Guest]: to be painted and represented as

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
[Guest]: sitting at the Jharoka? It is the

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
[Guest]: emperor. So if you put all these

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
[Guest]: points together that she does and she

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
[Guest]: does do all these things and put it in the

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
[Guest]: context of the time, it means as

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
[Guest]: Shubilal has said that she is co-empress.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
[Guest]: She shares power

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
[Guest]: equally with Jahangir who shares that

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
[Guest]: power with her. He is not doing it because he is

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
[Guest]: debased or because he is in the throes

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
[Guest]: of alcohol or anything else.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
[Guest]: He does it because he is happy to share

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
[Guest]: power with a very talented woman

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
[Guest]: at a time when he is poorly, his health

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
[Guest]: is failing and this woman

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
[Guest]: has the vision and the

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
[Guest]: aesthetic vision to carry his

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
[Guest]: legacy forward which she does

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
[Guest]: you know when we look at the tomb that she

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
[Guest]: builds for Itmad-ud-Daulah's tomb

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
[Guest]: outside Agra. If you look at that

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
[Guest]: tomb, it is the culmination

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
[Guest]: for me. That's why I have focused more on Itmad-ud-Daulah's

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
[Guest]: tomb and less the other aspects which

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
[Guest]: Shubilal has covered so well.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
[Guest]: Itmad-ud-Daulah's tomb is the culmination

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
[Guest]: of Noor Jahan's talent and we look

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
[Guest]: at that building built years

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
[Guest]: before the Taj Mahal. It is in pure

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
[Guest]: white marble which had never been done before

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
[Guest]: and which Shah Jahan did because he saw

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
[Guest]: Itmad-ud-Daulah's tomb. It has got inlay

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
[Guest]: work which had never been done before which was later

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
[Guest]: copied in the Taj Mahal. So it is

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
[Guest]: a trailblazing monument. It is a

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
[Guest]: beautiful, exquisite monument

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
[Guest]: and if you look at, so she builds this for her parents.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
[Guest]: She is very dedicated to her parents

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
[Guest]: who are both, as I said, very talented people.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
[Guest]: When they die, she is heartbroken

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
[Guest]: and they die within three months of each other

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
[Guest]: which I also find very moving.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
[Guest]: The wife dies

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
[Guest]: and Jahangir writes in his biography

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
[Guest]: that you know the poor man, Itmad-ud-Daulah

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
[Guest]: is heartbroken. I am trying to cheer him up

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
[Guest]: but I fear for his life and within three

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
[Guest]: months of his wife's death, he passes away

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
[Guest]: too. He is so, you know

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
[Guest]: he and his wife are so close

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
[Guest]: and then Nur Jahan builds this

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
[Guest]: beautiful tomb for them. At the same

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
[Guest]: time, Jahangir

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
[Guest]: is building a tomb for his mother, you know

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
[Guest]: not long after. Maryam

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
[Guest]: Uzzomani's tomb which you can see today also

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
[Guest]: outside Agra and it is a

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
[Guest]: thing of very little beauty

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
[Guest]: and very little grace and it is actually

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
[Guest]: a reconfigured Lodhi

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
[Guest]: Biradri. So he has just taken an existing

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
[Guest]: structure, added two, three things to it

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
[Guest]: and said I will bury my mother here.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
[Guest]: So I talked about this once, you know

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
[Guest]: at a talk I was giving and I was saying

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
[Guest]: I think the lesson to be learnt here is that if you are

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
[Guest]: planning to build a mausoleum for yourself

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
[Guest]: give the task to your daughter not to

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
[Guest]: your son, you know because they take more

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
[Guest]: care with things like legacy and

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
[Guest]: memory and you know eternal

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of. Which some would say applies to more

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
[Guest]: things than just mausoleums.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
[Amit Varma]: Digressing slightly, you know you said

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
[Amit Varma]: you have grown up in Delhi and you are surrounded by all these

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
[Amit Varma]: great historical monuments and buildings

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
[Amit Varma]: and tombs and so on. Do you look

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
[Guest]: at them differently now? I do.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
[Guest]: I do, I do. That's a very

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
[Guest]: pertinent point that you have raised and I do

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
[Guest]: look at them very differently

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
[Guest]: and it's sad that we don't all do that

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
[Guest]: because we are surrounded by such treasures

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
[Guest]: in Delhi and many many other

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
[Amit Varma]: cities which we take for granted

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
[Guest]: all the time. Not only do we take

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
[Guest]: it for granted, we let them fall to ruin

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
[Guest]: to disrepair

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
[Guest]: and there are so many good people trying to

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
[Guest]: work against that and trying

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
[Guest]: to get us more aware of these amazing things

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
[Guest]: that we have just in our life

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
[Guest]: around us. If you compare with other

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
[Guest]: cities who don't have that

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
[Guest]: you know you feel bereft without all

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
[Guest]: this history. Here we take it for granted but it is

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
[Guest]: such a wonderful thing to have.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
[Guest]: Now when I look at them, I look at the stones

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
[Guest]: and I see what they have to say

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
[Guest]: I know I can figure out what influence

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
[Guest]: is there, who came later, what they

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
[Guest]: tried to change. You can see

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
[Guest]: a Mughal building with a bit of a temple statue

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
[Guest]: element in it, you know that some temple

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
[Guest]: must have been broken and this

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
[Guest]: bit was taken because this was the

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
[Guest]: pragmatic reality. We used

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
[Guest]: materials whether one way or the other. You found

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
[Guest]: materials lying around, you used it

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
[Guest]: but if you are not told these things

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
[Guest]: and you don't have the eyes to see it

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
[Guest]: then you know it just gets wasted in a way

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
[Amit Varma]: and it's such a shame.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
[Guest]: So do you go often to... I do.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
[Guest]: So I go for a lot of heritage walks

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
[Guest]: part of my research

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
[Guest]: I call it part of my research though I love it immensely

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
[Guest]: is going for these walks because

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
[Guest]: we haven't talked a great deal about the

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
[Guest]: research process but there is the primary sources

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
[Guest]: there is the written material but there is also

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
[Guest]: this intangible thing around us

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
[Guest]: which is these heritage walks

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
[Guest]: where these people who are not

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
[Guest]: sometimes historians but sometimes amateurs

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
[Guest]: and enthusiasts, they are able to create

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
[Guest]: a sense of those times when you go on

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
[Guest]: these walks with them. They'll tell you

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
[Guest]: what music was playing perhaps

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
[Guest]: or what pan you were supposed to have

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
[Guest]: at this location or whether there was a well

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
[Guest]: there so you heard the trickling water

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
[Guest]: so these people are also part of my research

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
[Guest]: you know and I get a great deal of

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
[Guest]: knowledge from going on these historical

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
[Guest]: walks. So going on these walks has

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
[Guest]: really opened my eyes to a lot of

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
[Guest]: these monuments that are just lying around

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
[Amit Varma]: you know. So much wealth

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
[Amit Varma]: all around us, all my Bombay friends who

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
[Amit Varma]: mock Delhi for the pollution

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
[Guest]: and the people that is a lot more than that.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Oh please.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about a

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
[Amit Varma]: character you've written about more than just

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
[Amit Varma]: in this book which is Jahanara

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
[Unknown]: who is sort of the daughter of

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
[Amit Varma]: Shah Jahan and she is unmarried

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
[Amit Varma]: and you know she is a Padshah Begum

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
[Amit Varma]: she is known as Begum Sahab

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
[Amit Varma]: and her history

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
[Amit Varma]: is kind of tragic and almost

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
[Amit Varma]: a counterpoint to her younger sister Roshanara

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
[Guest]: You know I'll challenge you on that Amit

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
[Guest]: and say that

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
[Guest]: I think it is later people who have

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
[Guest]: inferred that it was tragic

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
[Guest]: perhaps because she was unmarried

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
[Guest]: I wonder if she didn't actually prefer

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
[Guest]: it that way because she was

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
[Guest]: Shah Jahan's favourite daughter, eldest daughter

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
[Guest]: also. She was 17 when Mumtaz Mahal

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
[Guest]: died and half of Mumtaz

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
[Guest]: Mahal's wealth which was a substantial

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
[Guest]: amount, half of it went to Jahanara

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
[Guest]: Begum. So you can see

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
[Guest]: the way in the

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
[Guest]: matriarchies carry on this

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
[Guest]: tradition of giving wealth to their daughters

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
[Guest]: so she has this enormous wealth at the age of 17

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
[Guest]: already and she only accumulates

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
[Guest]: wealth because she becomes more and more

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
[Guest]: powerful. Shah Jahan

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
[Guest]: gives her villagers in her name, he gives her

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
[Guest]: trading ship, all the noblemen keep

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
[Guest]: gifting her jewels and then she becomes an immensely

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
[Guest]: powerful woman. Wealthy

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
[Guest]: and powerful and she has the talent and ambition

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
[Guest]: to do something with it. And I wonder

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
[Guest]: if she was married to somebody

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
[Guest]: it would be an inconsequential man because all

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
[Guest]: who do we have left?

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
[Guest]: In the wars of succession all the uncles have been

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
[Guest]: killed off, the cousins have been killed off

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
[Guest]: no powerful timid men remain

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
[Guest]: for her to exist. Who would she have married?

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
[Guest]: What kind of life would she have had? She would have had to

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
[Guest]: bow out of the Mughal court

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
[Guest]: which her younger sisters did, the ones who

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
[Guest]: married, they bow out of Mughal history

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
[Guest]: we don't hear about them ever again.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
[Guest]: I think Jahanara with her ambition

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
[Guest]: was very happy to be the

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
[Guest]: unmarried daughter of the greatest

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
[Guest]: emperor on earth at that time.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
[Guest]: You must remember that we put this in context

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
[Guest]: we must put it in global context. This was

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
[Guest]: the most powerful and financially

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
[Amit Varma]: wealthy empire on earth.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
[Amit Varma]: So she was basically like Ivanka Trump

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Oh dear, where have we come to?

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
[Amit Varma]: I shouldn't have said that.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
[Guest]: So you know

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
[Guest]: I don't think she was that unhappy

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
[Guest]: she had personal tragedies

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
[Guest]: which of us doesn't. Her beloved

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
[Guest]: Dara Shikoh, her brother

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
[Guest]: is of course killed by Aurangzeb. She loses

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
[Guest]: in that sense because she supported

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
[Guest]: Dara Shikoh so she lost that battle

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
[Guest]: but she won the war because Aurangzeb

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
[Guest]: after the death of Shah Jahan brings her

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
[Guest]: back to court, reinstates her as

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
[Guest]: Padshah Begum. Not only that

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
[Guest]: he allows her a home

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
[Guest]: outside of the Zanana

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
[Guest]: of the Red Fort. So she has an independent

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
[Guest]: luxurious lifestyle where

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
[Guest]: she can now create a court

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
[Guest]: of music. So she starts to patronize

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
[Guest]: musicians and poets. So

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
[Guest]: in the end of her life this is what she has.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
[Guest]: So I don't think she is such

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
[Guest]: an unhappy woman at the end of the day after all.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
[Amit Varma]: But in this activity, in living

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
[Amit Varma]: separately, in building this house of music

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
[Amit Varma]: she is in a microcosm doing

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
[Amit Varma]: what could have happened if her brother

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
[Guest]: Dara Shikoh had actually...

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
[Guest]: Well, you know Dara Shikoh is one of the great

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
[Guest]: what ifs of history, right?

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
[Guest]: But to be very honest

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
[Guest]: he was not a very competent ruler.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
[Guest]: I don't think he would have made a very competent ruler

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
[Guest]: though we are instinctively drawn

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
[Guest]: to him because of his history

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
[Guest]: because of his interest in the

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
[Guest]: Indian literature and his

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
[Guest]: translating all those documents

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
[Guest]: and him wanting to understand

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
[Guest]: Indian, Hindustani literature better.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
[Guest]: So we want the

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
[Guest]: goofy prince to have been king

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
[Guest]: and to have created something wonderful.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
[Guest]: But I am sorry to say that he was

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
[Guest]: a bit of a weakling, a bit

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
[Guest]: of a vain man who had a tendency to

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
[Guest]: listen to the sycophants around him

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
[Guest]: who believed all that, who had

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
[Guest]: a rather inflated idea of what he could do

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
[Guest]: and could not do it. When push came to

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
[Guest]: shove he could not fight his brother. He

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
[Guest]: lost every battle against Aurangzeb.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
[Guest]: So if he had won somehow

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
[Guest]: or the other, I am not sure the empire

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
[Amit Varma]: would have progressed the way it did.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
[Amit Varma]: You know the reason they were fighting in the first

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
[Amit Varma]: place is of course the Timurid line of succession

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
[Amit Varma]: where it's not necessarily

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
[Amit Varma]: the eldest son who ascends to the throne

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
[Unknown]: but it's a meritocracy, you

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
[Amit Varma]: fight for it and whoever is left standing at the end

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
[Amit Varma]: of it and I don't know if that's a feature or a bug

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
[Amit Varma]: because the good part of it is that

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
[Amit Varma]: the able ruler will eventually

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
[Amit Varma]: in theory get there but the bad part

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
[Amit Varma]: of it is that you have all this politics

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
[Unknown]: and intrigue and mistrust

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
[Amit Varma]: And once Aurangzeb comes on the scene

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
[Amit Varma]: even though he

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
[Amit Varma]: rehabilitates Jahanara and all of that

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
[Amit Varma]: women start being

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
[Guest]: a little less consequential.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
[Guest]: Yes, even Jahanara Begum

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
[Guest]: we hear much less of her

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
[Guest]: she is Patsha Begum

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
[Guest]: but I was not able to find

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
[Guest]: very much about her

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
[Guest]: about what she had accomplished post the

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
[Guest]: death of Shah Jahan apart from the fact that

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
[Guest]: she arranges for some grand weddings

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
[Guest]: which was very much a role that the women carried out

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
[Guest]: grand weddings for her nieces.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
[Guest]: So she continued that nurturing

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
[Guest]: of the women

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
[Guest]: the line of the women and looking after

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
[Guest]: the marriages

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
[Guest]: so she did do that and as I said she had

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
[Guest]: a home of culture, of music and poetry

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
[Guest]: but all the great buildings

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
[Guest]: have now died up. There is none of this

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
[Guest]: commissioning of amazing grand projects

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
[Guest]: and Aurangzeb's daughters

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
[Guest]: also, we must also

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
[Guest]: remember that for most of their life

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
[Guest]: Aurangzeb is in the Deccan so it's a very different

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
[Guest]: atmosphere. It is not

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
[Guest]: the court of Delhi

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
[Guest]: which has been emptied now

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
[Guest]: out of its great musicians, its great

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
[Guest]: architects and its great

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
[Guest]: gentlemen, they have all gone away

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
[Guest]: so it is a very different court

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
[Guest]: and definitely it is not a court in which

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
[Guest]: the women are much in the limelight

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
[Guest]: I think I am not an expert on

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
[Guest]: Aurangzeb but it is my

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
[Guest]: feeling that later on he has been

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
[Guest]: he is so suspicious of all those around him

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
[Guest]: because he has been betrayed

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
[Guest]: this happens all the time, one daughter

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
[Guest]: would support another brother thinking

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
[Guest]: that Aurangzeb will surely now

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
[Guest]: pass away, he lives to the age of 90

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
[Guest]: but all along people think ok at 50

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
[Guest]: he will die, at 60 he will die, at 70

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
[Guest]: so the daughters support other brothers

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
[Guest]: in their bid for the throne. Aurangzeb

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
[Guest]: finds out about this and imprisons them

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
[Guest]: so he is shackled

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
[Guest]: by this great suspicion

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
[Guest]: of all those around him and he doesn't let

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
[Guest]: anybody else shine in the light the way

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
[Amit Varma]: Jahanara did. So in a sense they are all

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
[Amit Varma]: also in a manner imprisoned by

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
[Amit Varma]: this great opportunity that the Timurid

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
[Amit Varma]: line of succession also is.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
[Guest]: Yes, the women

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
[Guest]: definitely were also

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
[Guest]: because in a way

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
[Guest]: they die out, they are not allowed

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
[Guest]: they don't marry, they aren't Timurid

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
[Guest]: contenders so they can't marry anymore

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
[Guest]: and so the women

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
[Guest]: after Aurangzeb, it would be

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
[Guest]: interesting to write a Daughters of the Sun part 2

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
[Guest]: because after that you find

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
[Guest]: a very different sort of woman coming to the

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
[Guest]: limelight, it is no longer these Timurid

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
[Guest]: royal women, it is

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
[Guest]: lower caste women who get married, concubines

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
[Guest]: who rise up because they are no longer

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
[Guest]: any more Timurid women so it goes

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
[Guest]: in a different direction post Aurangzeb

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
[Guest]: which is also interesting but yes the Timurids

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
[Guest]: that hold that they have over these women

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
[Guest]: actually ended up in a certain way

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
[Amit Varma]: in them dying out.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
[Amit Varma]: And speaking of those books waiting to be written

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
[Amit Varma]: do you find that what

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
[Amit Varma]: you are a part of in a small way

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
[Amit Varma]: which is this changing of this gaze

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, going away

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
[Amit Varma]: from the traditional gaze, going away from the

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
[Amit Varma]: male gaze, looking at it, looking at

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
[Amit Varma]: history differently, looking at heroism

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
[Amit Varma]: differently, looking at the role that

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
[Amit Varma]: women played in politics and all of it differently

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
[Amit Varma]: do you find

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
[Amit Varma]: that you are like one of a handful

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
[Amit Varma]: of voices in the wilderness or the way history

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
[Amit Varma]: is being practiced itself is gradually

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
[Guest]: changing?

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
[Guest]: I hope that it's changing Amit

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
[Guest]: it's definitely being practiced differently

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
[Guest]: at least with narrative history

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
[Guest]: I find that in the past few

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
[Guest]: years there have been a slew of books

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
[Guest]: mine is just one amongst many

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
[Guest]: books, amazing books have been written whether

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
[Guest]: Parvati Sharma's Jahangir, you know

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
[Guest]: Manu Pillai who's been writing, Rana Safdie who's been

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
[Guest]: writing, Rubilal

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
[Guest]: there are a number of books which are pitched

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
[Guest]: at the layperson so that's

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
[Guest]: a wonderful new thing. These are, early on we had

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
[Guest]: we've always had great history writers but

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
[Guest]: they've been academics and they've been pitched

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
[Guest]: at other academics you know so it hasn't

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
[Guest]: filtered down to the layperson

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
[Guest]: to the degree that I find now

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
[Guest]: it seems to be doing

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
[Guest]: whether at the academic and scholarly level

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
[Guest]: it is also going in a certain direction, I hope so

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
[Guest]: with people like Rubilal doing

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
[Guest]: the work she's doing, I hope so

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
[Guest]: you know I hope that the scholars

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
[Guest]: certainly people like the art historians

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
[Guest]: are setting the history world on

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
[Guest]: fire and we haven't talked so much

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
[Guest]: about miniatures but art history is something

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
[Guest]: that I use a lot when I'm researching

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
[Guest]: because you know we always

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
[Guest]: think that this physical evidence is static

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
[Guest]: that it's there and you can look at it

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
[Guest]: but it's always been the same, that's not true

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
[Guest]: and art historians

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
[Guest]: are at the vanguard of this change

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
[Guest]: because they are looking at these same miniatures

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
[Guest]: from say 500 years ago, 400 years ago

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
[Guest]: and they're reinterpreting them

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
[Guest]: in completely new ways, completely

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
[Guest]: novel ways which is changing then the way somebody

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
[Guest]: like I would write about history

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
[Guest]: so for example there's a miniature from the time

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
[Guest]: of Humayun which used to be called

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
[Guest]: Humayun and his brothers

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
[Guest]: just a very general one, if you look at it

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
[Guest]: it looks like a painting of somebody

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
[Guest]: you know who has taken a lot of

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
[Guest]: hallucinatory drugs

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
[Guest]: because it's full of colors and wild colors

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
[Guest]: and there are lots of figures

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
[Guest]: but art historians, I think it is

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
[Guest]: Dr. Laura Parodi has had a close look

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
[Guest]: at this painting which is of Humayun

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
[Guest]: and somebody who looks like his brother

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
[Guest]: Hindal next to him and

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
[Guest]: other gentlemen also but groups

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
[Guest]: of women as well and she has looked

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
[Guest]: at these groups of women and she has individually

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
[Guest]: identified them and said

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
[Guest]: that one group of women is clearly

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
[Guest]: Hamida Banu Begum, Gulbadan

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
[Guest]: Begum, I think Bega Begum

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
[Guest]: and a fourth sister and another

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
[Guest]: set of women is the milk mothers, perhaps

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
[Guest]: Mahamanga and Jidiyanga

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
[Guest]: so now we are looking at this

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
[Guest]: in a completely different light, this is not Humayun

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
[Guest]: and his brothers, this is a place

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
[Guest]: where women were very very important

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
[Guest]: and they have said this is probably

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
[Guest]: a place associated with fertility

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
[Guest]: rights, therefore it is probably the

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
[Guest]: circumcision ceremony of Akbar

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
[Guest]: so it is telling us a great deal about

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
[Guest]: what happened during circumcision ceremonies, how

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
[Guest]: important the women were, how important

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
[Guest]: fertility rights were, which was something that we had

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
[Guest]: not talked about at all before

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
[Guest]: and will completely now change the way that I

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
[Guest]: will write about episodes like

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
[Guest]: this. So yes

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
[Guest]: art historians are definitely

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
[Guest]: pushing those boundaries and

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
[Guest]: bringing in new ways, new interpretations

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
[Amit Varma]: all the time. This sounds really fascinating

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
[Amit Varma]: though a young millennial today

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
[Amit Varma]: would think oh it's like Facebook tagging, you go

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
[Amit Varma]: back to the past and you take a miniature

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
[Amit Varma]: and you tag everybody and you give

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
[Unknown]: the location and all that. Exactly

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of like that. So you know

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
[Amit Varma]: my listeners keep asking me on social media

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
[Amit Varma]: that you talk to such interesting guests, why don't you

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
[Amit Varma]: get some book recommendations for us

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
[Amit Varma]: because we want to read more on this subject

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
[Amit Varma]: so you know for example art history

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
[Amit Varma]: what do you recommend people read

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
[Amit Varma]: or even just history in general

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
[Amit Varma]: what are the books in the last few years

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
[Guest]: which you just thought everybody must read

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
[Guest]: I think for anybody

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
[Guest]: who is interested in gendered history

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
[Guest]: even Empress you know

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
[Guest]: the biography of Noor Jehan will change

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
[Guest]: the way you look at Noor Jehan. Rubilal

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
[Guest]: Rubilal will change the way you look at Jahangir

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
[Guest]: you know. So that's an important

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
[Guest]: book. I very much

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
[Guest]: enjoyed Rebel Sultans by you know

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
[Guest]: Manu.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
[Guest]: What else would I recommend? You know I read some pretty

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
[Guest]: dry stuff so I don't know if I would recommend it

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
[Guest]: to all your listeners

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
[Guest]: but anything that's coming out of

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
[Guest]: on you know any of these coffee table books

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
[Guest]: on the art history, on miniatures

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
[Guest]: is changing all the time so it's

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
[Guest]: absolutely fascinating even for a lay person

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
[Guest]: to read because A you have the

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
[Guest]: images which sometimes seem

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
[Guest]: dull and repetitive if you just look at it

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
[Guest]: you know without the knowledge behind it

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
[Guest]: but when you are told certain details

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
[Guest]: you know about the

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
[Guest]: miniatures then you look at it

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
[Guest]: completely differently. For example there's a

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
[Guest]: painting which is used

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
[Guest]: constantly called Birth of a Prince

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
[Guest]: it's probably the birth of Salim

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
[Guest]: the future Jahangir and

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
[Guest]: when you look and I've looked at it many times and I've used

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
[Guest]: it in my books, in the middle is the mother

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
[Guest]: and all around her are what are

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
[Guest]: timorous looking women and some

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
[Guest]: Rajasthani looking women but she

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
[Guest]: herself is dusky you know

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
[Guest]: and she's clearly Rajasthani and this is her

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
[Guest]: Kabai herself and I think

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
[Guest]: you know my god the makers of Jodha Akbar

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
[Guest]: should have looked at this before casting Aishwarya Rai

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
[Guest]: because she looks nothing like this you know

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
[Guest]: so books on art

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
[Guest]: history today are amazing

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
[Guest]: and they will open your eyes to something

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
[Guest]: completely novel and a new way of seeing the past

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
[Amit Varma]: It's really exciting I'm going to go to

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
[Guest]: Amazon right after this. Can we now ask

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
[Guest]: what are you working on now?

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
[Guest]: So now I'm still in the Mughal period

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
[Guest]: and I'm writing

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
[Guest]: a history of Akbar, a biography

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
[Guest]: of Akbar and

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
[Guest]: it's very exciting for me because

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
[Guest]: so far I've only seen Akbar really

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
[Guest]: through his women so now I'm seeing

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
[Guest]: Akbar but with his women

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
[Guest]: alongside him because I think they're often written

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
[Guest]: out of histories of Akbar

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
[Guest]: you know it has as we have been

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
[Guest]: discussing this entire time

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
[Guest]: scholars tend to scrunch up

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
[Guest]: the history of Mughal women into one chapter

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
[Guest]: so you have 200 years of existence

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
[Guest]: changing, dynamic existence

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
[Guest]: scrunched up into one way

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
[Guest]: of being as if there is a one way in

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
[Guest]: 200 years things won't change you know as if food

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
[Guest]: won't change, etiquette won't change

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
[Guest]: so with Akbar I'm hoping to

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
[Guest]: show not just his

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
[Guest]: life but how from his very birth

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
[Guest]: from the time of you know his milk mothers

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
[Guest]: how all these women entered his life

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
[Guest]: changed him, influenced him

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
[Guest]: how he changed them like the

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
[Guest]: Rajput women and how

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
[Guest]: Akbar and build a I hope

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
[Guest]: a more complex and nuanced

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
[Guest]: image of this

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
[Amit Varma]: great Badshah. I urge you

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
[Amit Varma]: to leave the studio and

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
[Guest]: write the book fast because I cannot wait

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
[Guest]: to read it. Thanks so much for coming on this season.
