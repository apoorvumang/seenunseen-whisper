00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.880
[Amit Varma]: I had a strange dream the other night.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.240
[Amit Varma]: I dreamed I was at a party and I was surrounded by rich industrialists.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.280
[Amit Varma]: They were dressed in the finest clothes, drinking the best alcohol, talking in fancy accents

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.120
[Amit Varma]: and doing mua mua mua to people around them as they distributed air kisses like government

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.120
[Amit Varma]: loans.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.880
[Amit Varma]: I went to the bar to get a cocktail for myself and bumped into a man there who was bare chested

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.920
[Amit Varma]: and wore just a dirty dhoti.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.920
[Amit Varma]: It was Vijay Mallya.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.200
[Amit Varma]: Mr. Mallya, I said surprised, what are you doing back in India?

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.360
[Amit Varma]: Oh, hi Amit, he said, call me Vijay.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.200
[Amit Varma]: It's so good to finally meet you.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.120
[Amit Varma]: I really love your podcast, The Seen and the Unseen.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.600
[Amit Varma]: I used to be unseen and now I am seen again.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.520
[Amit Varma]: Arre bro, answer my question, I said.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.000
[Amit Varma]: How did you come back to India?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.560
[Amit Varma]: I thought you defaulted on your loans.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.480
[Amit Varma]: I thought you were on the run, Mr. Mallya said.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.920
[Amit Varma]: I was.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.640
[Amit Varma]: Now I am not.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:20.240
[Amit Varma]: I simply got myself declared as a farmer and then my loans were waived, muhahahahaha, muhahahaha.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.680
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.760
[Unknown]: Your weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.080
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.800
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.760
[Amit Varma]: Today's episode is on a chronic disease that is once again sweeping through India like

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.680
[Amit Varma]: an epidemic, farm loan waivers.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.280
[Amit Varma]: My first guest today is Vivek Kaul, a columnist for Equity Master who has written the Easy

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.600
[Amit Varma]: Money Trilogy.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.400
[Amit Varma]: Do check out his fine book, India's Big Government, which is on Amazon right now.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.920
[Amit Varma]: My second guest is Kumar Anand, an economist based in Mumbai.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.880
[Amit Varma]: Vivek and Kumar, welcome to the show.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Thanks Amit.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.040
[Amit Varma]: Thanks Amit.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.280
[Amit Varma]: Kumar, I remember you once told me a fascinating story about your dad who works in a bank.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.440
[Amit Varma]: Can you tell us about it again?

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.760
[Guest 1]: My dad is retired now, but yeah, the story goes back in 2008.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.960
[Guest 1]: So early 2008, this was just before Manmohan Singh government announced a farm loan waiver

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.320
[Guest 1]: of about 60,000 crore, if I'm not mistaken.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.760
[Guest 1]: So my father, he was a bank manager for a regional rural bank in a small town in Bihar

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.520
[Guest 1]: and as part of his day-to-day job, he has given and disbursed a lot of loans.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.280
[Guest 1]: And one particular kind of loan was something under which is disbursed to farmers called

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.020
[Guest 1]: Kisan Credit Cards.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.440
[Guest 1]: So this is a small sum of money which is given to farmers to meet their daily production,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.480
[Guest 1]: you know, expenses.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.220
[Guest 1]: So it was a small sum of money for 50,000 rupees.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.640
[Guest 1]: So this guy who the money was given to, he comes to my father with 40,000 rupees with

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:59.640
[Guest 1]: the intention of returning as a lump sum payment back to the bank and says that before depositing

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.080
[Guest 1]: the money, he says to my dad that, sir, I have been listening to the stories, a lot

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.920
[Guest 1]: of murmurs and chatter that there is going to be a farm loan waiver, you know, politicians

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.320
[Guest 1]: are talking about it, probably something is going to come.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.280
[Guest 1]: And then my father convinces him that, you know, why you should still deposit because

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.880
[Guest 1]: it was the job of my father to convince him and so that, you know, the banks continue

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.920
[Guest 1]: to do good business.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.280
[Guest 1]: And overall, basically, he agrees and he deposits the money.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.280
[Guest 1]: And just about a few days later, Manmohan Singh government comes and announces the farm

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.560
[Guest 1]: loan waiver.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.400
[Guest 1]: So a few days later, he comes back to see my dad in the bank and says, sir, my neighbor

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.440
[Guest 1]: who has taken the loan with no intention of returning the money is now going to get the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.400
[Guest 1]: entire, you know, his loan waived off, while just because I made the mistake of being an

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.800
[Guest 1]: honest borrower and paying back on time, I am stuck with getting no relief.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.760
[Amit Varma]: So essentially what the farm loan waiver did was that farm loan waivers incentivize the

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.600
[Amit Varma]: dishonest people who don't mean to return and it punishes the honest people who are

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.560
[Amit Varma]: actually making an effort to return the money on time.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.760
[Amit Varma]: And economists, of course, as you know, call this a moral hazard.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.040
[Amit Varma]: The same principle, for example, applies to the bailouts of banks, big banks too big to

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.280
[Amit Varma]: fail that happened after the 2008 crisis, that if you know you're going to get bailed

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.960
[Amit Varma]: out, if you know you're going to get a waiver, then you don't have to behave responsibly

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.560
[Amit Varma]: because the consequences of that are not what they otherwise would be.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.120
[Guest 1]: Yeah, underlying there are different issues in case of bankers getting bailed out.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.240
[Guest 1]: They knew it was they are too big to fail.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.480
[Guest 1]: So definitely the politicians will come and bail them out, or at least this euphoria is

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.480
[Guest 1]: being created that we are too big to fail, so we have to bail them out.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.400
[Guest 1]: In the case of farmers, it is that, you know, there's a big chunk of votes to be gained

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.560
[Amit Varma]: from there.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.640
[Amit Varma]: So and so and we'd written a piece on this for all the listeners.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.280
[Amit Varma]: If you just go over to Pragati at thinkpragati.com, Kumar and I wrote a piece about the Joint

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.040
[Amit Varma]: League, which essentially had the headline politics is equal to bribery, which we believe

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.840
[Amit Varma]: almost all politics is.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.680
[Amit Varma]: It amounts to a redistribution of wealth from common voters to either specific interest

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.200
[Amit Varma]: groups who fund the parties or to specific vote banks.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.000
[Amit Varma]: This is farm loan waivers, of course, a very overt case of this kind of redistribution

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.440
[Amit Varma]: because the money doesn't come from nowhere.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.920
[Amit Varma]: And farmers, of course, are a valuable vote bank.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.900
[Amit Varma]: And you can support this with the rhetoric of, oh, you know, the farmers are the backbone

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.360
[Amit Varma]: of our country and they need our support and they are suffering and so on and so forth.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.360
[Amit Varma]: Where the point here to be noted is that in the long run, this doesn't really help the

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.360
[Amit Varma]: farmers either.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.360
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.120
[Guest 1]: Just to complete the story, what stood out for me in the episode with my father and the

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.920
[Guest 1]: loanee was my father was very disheartened because in future, anyone who he gives out

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.120
[Guest 1]: loan to, it will be very hard for him to say, you know, that you should come and return

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.560
[Guest 1]: back your loan on time.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.240
[Amit Varma]: Because he knows that the rational course of action for the other guy is to not return

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.240
[Guest 1]: his loan.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.600
[Guest 1]: That is the system we've created.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.100
[Amit Varma]: That is the incentive that we have put in place.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.520
[Amit Varma]: And in a manner of speaking, the guy who returned the loan subsidized the guy who didn't return

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.520
[Guest 2]: the loan.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.520
[Guest 2]: Absolutely.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.520
[Amit Varma]: Can I just butt in here?

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.520
[Guest 2]: Sure.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.560
[Guest 2]: So, you know, you know, the various state governments have been waiving off farm loans

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.360
[Guest 2]: over the past few weeks.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.520
[Guest 2]: So the government of Maharashtra has waived off farm loans and what they've done is they've

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:32.040
[Guest 2]: also provided an incentive of rupees 25,000 to people who haven't, you know, defaulted

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.360
[Guest 2]: on their farm loan.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.360
[Guest 2]: So this is like, you know, rubbing salt on their wounds.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.280
[Guest 2]: And how much are the people who actually?

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.880
[Guest 2]: I think that number is around one and a half lakh.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.880
[Guest 2]: So essentially, anybody who's defaulted gets a benefit, you know, of six times, you know,

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.800
[Guest 2]: more than someone who's not defaulted.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.520
[Guest 2]: So anyone who's not defaulted ends up looking very, very stupid.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.880
[Guest 2]: And the next time, you know, it's more or less sure that he's going to default.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.880
[Amit Varma]: Which is crazy.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.620
[Amit Varma]: I mean, and farm loan waivers just perpetuate this nonsense, because then you have this

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.400
[Amit Varma]: whole cycle playing out all over again for the next election season.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.280
[Amit Varma]: So tell me something, Vivek, since, you know, we can all be agreed that farm loan waivers

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.000
[Amit Varma]: are not a solution at all.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.680
[Amit Varma]: What are the problems that ail our agriculture?

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.880
[Amit Varma]: Like why are like our farmers' grievances are genuine?

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.000
[Amit Varma]: There is a serious agricultural crisis in this country.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.800
[Amit Varma]: Why is that crisis there?

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.640
[Amit Varma]: And while, you know, it's just too deep and complex a problem, what are some of the possible

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.800
[Amit Varma]: directions in which the solutions lie?

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:40.840
[Guest 2]: Okay, I mean, that's a topic for a book, but I'll just try summarizing a few points here.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.800
[Guest 2]: So one of the things that has happened, you know, during the course of this year is that

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:52.920
[Guest 2]: farmers have ended up producing more of, you know, products like pulses, onions, etc.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.160
[Guest 2]: Now, what has happened is that because of that, the prices have crashed.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:05.400
[Guest 2]: Now, the government declares a minimum support price for 23 crops, but it buys only, primarily

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.600
[Guest 2]: buys only two crops at the MSP, rice and wheat.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.480
[Guest 2]: It has also started buying pulses over the last couple of years.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:19.360
[Guest 2]: And, you know, during the course of the last financial year, only around 5% of pulses were

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.520
[Guest 2]: bought at the MSP.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:28.640
[Guest 2]: So what has happened because of that is that, you know, farmers have not been able to sell

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.360
[Guest 2]: their pulses even at the MSP.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.680
[Guest 2]: So prices have gone below the MSP.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.480
[Guest 2]: Why did they grow so many pulses?

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.120
[Guest 2]: Because what has happened is one is, you know, they look at the past prices where in, you

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.960
[Guest 2]: know, over the last two years, dal prices have gone through the roof, and in particular

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.360
[Guest 2]: urad dal, no, in particular, toor dal, not urad.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.840
[Guest 2]: So toor dal prices crossed 200 rupees per kg.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:58.040
[Guest 2]: And because of that, the production went up by close to 80% this year.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:04.440
[Guest 2]: Now, the problem is that, you know, there is no buying mechanism in place as far as

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.520
[Guest 2]: the government and the MSP pricing is concerned.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:15.920
[Guest 2]: So the prices have crashed, particularly in Maharashtra, where a lot of toor dal is grown.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.880
[Guest 2]: And so farmers are protesting, at least in Maharashtra, because of, you know, dal prices,

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.180
[Guest 2]: they're also protesting because onion prices have crashed this year.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:32.520
[Guest 2]: So we don't have, you know, a good storage mechanism in place.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.240
[Guest 2]: So that's one major reason why there is an agriculture crisis.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if I may just interject that kind of what your story reminds me is of my good

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.720
[Amit Varma]: friend Mohit Satyanand, who's also been a guest on the show, once told me that, because

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.600
[Amit Varma]: of MSPs being introduced in the late 1960s, one of the unseen effects of that was because

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.480
[Amit Varma]: the MSPs were for certain kinds of crop, I forget which ones now, but certain crops and

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.480
[Guest 2]: food grains.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.480
[Guest 2]: It started with wheat, and then rice and wheat.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.480
[Guest 2]: Sure.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.000
[Amit Varma]: And because of the MSPs, because of the security that farmers felt that, oh, iska toh MSP hai,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.080
[Amit Varma]: ye toh milega hai, ye toh minimum support price.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.720
[Amit Varma]: They put their energies into growing those, instead of things like pulses and so on, which

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:16.640
[Amit Varma]: led to massive protein deficiencies in India, especially, you know, the poorer you go, the

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.680
[Amit Varma]: greater the protein deficiency, which was and what you're now saying is very interesting

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.000
[Amit Varma]: that now, you know, that again happened because the government did not allow the market mechanism

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.640
[Amit Varma]: and people's actual demand to express itself and guide the supply.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.200
[Amit Varma]: And even if it's now swinging in the other direction, where farmers are screwed, because

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.640
[Amit Varma]: they've made too many pulses and whatever, again, this overproduction is partly because

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.760
[Amit Varma]: of government not allowing those market signals to accurately reach the farmers.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:48.320
[Amit Varma]: And it's a broader problem that goes beyond just setting the MSPs, it goes into, you know,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.320
[Amit Varma]: the entire trading mechanism being controlled, farmers aren't allowed to just sell the crops

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.320
[Guest 2]: as they want.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.280
[Guest 2]: Basically, you know, as far as the agriculture market in India is concerned, the market mechanism

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.520
[Guest 2]: doesn't really work now, which is true about pulses as well.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.920
[Guest 2]: Now, what has happened is this year, there has been an overproduction, which has led

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.920
[Guest 2]: to a crash in prices.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.960
[Guest 2]: Next year, the production will fall and the prices will rise again, will go up.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.160
[Guest 2]: The other thing that new needs point that needs to be made here is in the case of pulses

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.560
[Guest 2]: is that, you know, this year, the production of pulses has grown by around 37%.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.600
[Guest 2]: And you know, we produced around 22.4 million tons of pulses in total, which is the highest

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.200
[Guest 2]: ever production that has happened.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.280
[Guest 2]: Now, this is this should have been good news.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.800
[Guest 2]: But one reason why it's turned out to be a bad news is because, you know, export of pulses

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.760
[Guest 2]: is banned, whereas imports are allowed.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.960
[Guest 2]: So you know, in a year when the maximum production of pulses has happened, the maximum import

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.960
[Guest 2]: of pulses has also happened, which is crazy, which is sort of crazy.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.560
[Guest 2]: So you know, these are the ways why, you know, through which you do not allow the market

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.560
[Amit Varma]: mechanism.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:00.480
[Amit Varma]: In the case in the trend to understand the specific crisis, two questions one in the

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.880
[Amit Varma]: case of pulses and onions, is it partly because the government wanted to give this rhetoric

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.800
[Amit Varma]: of oh, we have brought the prices down because the prices of onions were an election issue

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.640
[Amit Varma]: once upon a time, and they overreached without understanding the unseen effect.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:20.760
[Guest 2]: So in case of pulses, you know, you can surely say that, given the fact that, you know, imports

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.640
[Guest 2]: continue to be allowed, while exports are not allowed, I mean, it seems I mean, you

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.040
[Guest 2]: can say that the conspiracy theory is that the government essentially wanted to sort

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.400
[Guest 2]: of, you know, ensure that prices of pulses crash.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.080
[Guest 2]: In case of onions, the story is a little more, you know, interesting.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:44.080
[Guest 2]: So the one of the biggest onion markets in India is in Rasalgaon near Nashik.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.040
[Guest 2]: And I looked at data for the month of January.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:55.120
[Guest 2]: And if you looked at, you know, compared data between 2017 and 2016, for the month of January,

00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.880
[Guest 2]: the supply of onions coming to the market increased by around 22%, whereas the prices

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.880
[Guest 2]: crashed by close to 46%.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.560
[Guest 2]: Now, one reason for that is, is the fact that, you know, demonetization sucked out a lot

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.960
[Guest 2]: of working capital out of agriculture.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.760
[Amit Varma]: That was going to be my second question.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.040
[Guest 2]: Yes, so demonetization has had, you know, interestingly, demonetization did not have

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.560
[Guest 2]: an impact on agriculture production.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:29.000
[Guest 2]: You know, this year, the food grain production went up by close to 8%, and horticulture production

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.920
[Guest 2]: went up by 3%.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:36.040
[Guest 2]: But it has had an impact on the prices that farmers are getting for their produce, because

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:42.040
[Guest 2]: the working capital was sucked out, out of agriculture markets, and that still hasn't

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.120
[Guest 2]: been replaced.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.720
[Amit Varma]: So you know, besides this, like I've heard previous episodes of The Seen and The Unseen,

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.080
[Amit Varma]: which you know, listeners can browse at seenunseen.in talking about agricultural issues, and the

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.680
[Amit Varma]: fact of the matter is that farmers aren't allowed to sell their agricultural land for

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.320
[Amit Varma]: non agricultural purposes, you aren't allowed to set up corporations that do farming.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.080
[Amit Varma]: So farmers are essentially not just forced to be farmers, they're also forced to be entrepreneurs

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.640
[Amit Varma]: and they're two completely separate skills.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.040
[Amit Varma]: And farmers are therefore trapped in agriculture and farm loan waivers, which you know, is

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.080
[Amit Varma]: a subject of this episode, essentially just perpetuates that it's like, you know, the

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.080
[Amit Varma]: problems of agriculture go so deep and so far.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:26.520
[Amit Varma]: And to just give a farm loan waiver to farmers is essentially like applying an ice pack to

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.800
[Amit Varma]: the head of someone who's had persistent fever, doing nothing at all to address the underlying

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.800
[Guest 2]: causes.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.920
[Guest 2]: I mean, there are too many underlying causes which go unaddressed, I mean, right to the

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:44.360
[Guest 2]: fact that, you know, the plot sizes in agriculture have come down dramatically over the years.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:50.480
[Guest 2]: And now, you know, in states like, you know, Bihar and Kerala, the plot sizes are too small

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.360
[Guest 2]: for, you know, any agriculture to be viable within that plot.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, this is a great point you'd made in our episode where we spoke about jobs where

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.680
[Amit Varma]: you said that a lot of these agitations, partidars in Gujarat, Jats in Haryana, are coming from

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.080
[Amit Varma]: landowning class, because the land holdings over the years have been divided so much and

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.760
[Amit Varma]: gotten, you know, so small.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.520
[Amit Varma]: And next week, we're going to have an episode where I talk with Shruti Rajagopalan about

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.760
[Amit Varma]: the right to the right to property, how it's happened over the years.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.320
[Amit Varma]: And one of the points she makes is that because of these laws around not being able to sell

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.720
[Amit Varma]: agricultural land for non agricultural purposes, you've essentially destroyed the value of

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.720
[Amit Varma]: that land.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.960
[Amit Varma]: If not completely dead capital, it's become really close to it, I'd call it comatose capital.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.800
[Amit Varma]: And that's also hit farmers hard, there is just simply no exit for them.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.480
[Guest 1]: I have just a question to add, and probably both of you can take a shot at it.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:46.120
[Guest 1]: Is there an agriculture market, so to speak, you know, is there a market at all?

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.960
[Guest 1]: So for example, if you look at all the ingredients, you know, electricity is not provided the

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.840
[Guest 1]: market price, there's heavily subsidized water, the same story, same stories with fertilizer.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.720
[Guest 1]: And then of course, agricultural labor also has now with NREGA, the prices has been, you

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.160
[Guest 1]: know, kind of distorted.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:08.680
[Guest 1]: So all the inputs if you look at, so whether it is labor, electricity, water, fertilizer,

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.240
[Guest 1]: the prices have been distorted.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.640
[Guest 1]: On the output, now there is MSP at which the procurement happens, and APMC, which is now

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.360
[Guest 1]: slowly and gradually probably some sort of reforms are happening on that front.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.280
[Guest 1]: But even then there is sort of monopsony.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.740
[Guest 1]: So there is a single buyer to some extent.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:28.520
[Guest 1]: So what that does, so I don't see a market agriculture market, so to speak, because both

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.720
[Guest 2]: on the buy side, on the sell side, it's all, it's a market, you know, in the not a market

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.600
[Guest 2]: in the conventional sense of the term.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.800
[Amit Varma]: But yes, I mean, you know, the kind of market you have in Soviet Russia, I mean, some place

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.680
[Guest 1]: where they probably go sell.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.600
[Guest 1]: So of course, then this huge misallocation of resources, also farmers running huge amount

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.000
[Guest 1]: of debts, or over production and under production of cycle happening is should not be a big

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
[Guest 1]: surprise for policy.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, like I often say that India lives in the cake, I often often often say India

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.080
[Amit Varma]: lives in different centuries, you know, 1920 or 21st and you know, we are probably privileged

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.080
[Amit Varma]: enough to have most of our existence in the 21st.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.080
[Amit Varma]: But farmers seem to be in the 19th and it can equally be therefore said that India lives

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.240
[Amit Varma]: under different systems.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.800
[Amit Varma]: So while we think our daily existence seems to be reasonably capitalist, but as you just

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.240
[Amit Varma]: described this, there doesn't seem to be any element of the market that actually affects

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.240
[Amit Varma]: agriculture.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.600
[Amit Varma]: Our agriculture is in such a mess for the same reasons that Soviet Russia collapsed

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:28.480
[Amit Varma]: and their economy was in such bad shape, because every element the state tries to control it.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.240
[Amit Varma]: And as we now know, through the lessons of history, the state cannot do that.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:37.520
[Guest 1]: Just to add to add to the point, I've done some background work on in economic history,

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.840
[Guest 1]: looking into the episodes, particularly post independence, and I've looked into the some

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:48.440
[Guest 1]: of the work by the great Sara Joshi, the late Sara Joshi, who led farmers revolution movements

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.680
[Guest 1]: around the country, starting with Maharashtra.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.440
[Guest 1]: Recently, I think it was Ajit Ranade who wrote about him.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:18:00.640
[Guest 1]: So it all started with the after independence, India wanted to focus on industries, to wanted

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.280
[Guest 1]: to promote industries.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:08.480
[Guest 1]: Now that you want to do it, you want to depress the prices of agriculture produced so that

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.040
[Guest 1]: laborers could be, you know, could access them at a very cost effective manner.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.360
[Guest 1]: So now to do that, you have to subsidize all those inputs.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.640
[Guest 1]: So just we talked about, you know, whether fertilizer, electricity, water, all those

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.040
[Guest 1]: subsidies happen.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.680
[Guest 1]: And when you're doing that, then you have to provide the right amount of price for the

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680
[Guest 1]: output.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.600
[Guest 1]: So for that, you started doing MSP.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:34.360
[Guest 1]: So in some ways, it's a cascade of policies, you know, I mean, bad policy one after another,

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.820
[Guest 1]: and we have not been able to diagnose the problem.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.240
[Guest 1]: And definitely, occasional farm loan waiver is not the solution.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:46.600
[Guest 1]: It's someone has said, it's like, it's a PPP model the government is planning, you know,

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.600
[Guest 1]: working on.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.920
[Amit Varma]: They don't actually plan poverty.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.360
[Amit Varma]: Here's my question for you, Vivek.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.520
[Amit Varma]: Since you've studied the finances of these farm loan waivers in some detail, the central

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.600
[Amit Varma]: government is now saying that look, all of these farm loan waivers are being done by

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.960
[Amit Varma]: the states, you know, the states will raise the finances for it, it doesn't affect us.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.960
[Amit Varma]: Is that really true?

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.960
[Guest 2]: No, not really.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:10.820
[Guest 2]: I mean, see, now, if you look at the state of Maharashtra, their original fiscal deficit

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:17.440
[Guest 2]: for this year was supposed to be around 37,289 crore with the farm loan waiver coming in,

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.440
[Guest 2]: it'll double.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.560
[Guest 2]: Now, that money has to be raised from somewhere.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.400
[Guest 2]: Now, one way is obviously you sort of raise some sort of taxes.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:31.680
[Guest 2]: I mean, you tax petrol more, you know, you know, right now, in Mumbai, when you buy petrol,

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.640
[Guest 2]: you pay a drought charge.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.080
[Guest 2]: So there is a per litre drought charge.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.240
[Guest 2]: Now, you know, this year, as far as we understand, there has been no drought.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.800
[Guest 2]: So why are we still paying a drought charge?

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.440
[Guest 2]: The other point is, obviously, most of these state governments, in fact, most of the money

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:54.600
[Guest 2]: which is waived off, will have to be borrowed, it will have to be borrowed because, you know,

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.240
[Guest 2]: banks cannot face these losses.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.280
[Guest 2]: So the state governments will have to compensate these banks.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:07.360
[Guest 2]: Now, when the state government borrows, you know, what it does is, it's the fiscal deficit

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.760
[Guest 2]: of the state government goes up, when the fiscal deficit of the state government goes

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:16.840
[Guest 2]: up, the fiscal deficit of the nation as a whole also goes up.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.680
[Guest 2]: State governments are ultimately able to borrow because their debt is guaranteed by the central

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.680
[Guest 2]: government.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.760
[Guest 2]: So in that sense, you know, ultimately, it's, you know, the debt of the central government

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:33.320
[Guest 2]: may not be going up, but the liability definitely is going up.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:39.400
[Guest 2]: Also, one needs to, you know, realize the fact that there are only, you know, so much

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.120
[Guest 2]: savings going around, which can be borrowed.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.320
[Guest 2]: And when the government borrows more, there is less for, you know, the private parties

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.320
[Guest 2]: to borrow.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.880
[Guest 2]: Now, at this point of time, it may not matter much because the private parties are also

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.160
[Guest 2]: not borrowing much.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.640
[Guest 2]: So the state governments will be able to borrow easily.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.360
[Guest 2]: But let's say, you know, six months down the line or a year down the line, you know, once

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:08.720
[Guest 2]: the demonetization effects start to ebb, and the economy starts to grow again, and private

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.600
[Guest 2]: sector borrowing picks up, I mean, then we will definitely, you know, have an impact.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:20.000
[Guest 2]: And, you know, you need to remember that we are still not done with all these wave offs.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.280
[Guest 2]: You know, only four states have waived off loans up until now, now till 2019, many more

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.800
[Guest 2]: states are supposed to go to the polls.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.720
[Guest 2]: And every time a state goes to, you know, polls, this will be the major issue.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.920
[Guest 2]: I mean, even if, you know, the BJP does not raise it, the opposition party in that particular

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.720
[Guest 2]: state definitely will.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.520
[Guest 2]: I mean, look at, you know, look at Karnataka, which is not really a BJP state right now,

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:50.680
[Guest 2]: it's governed by the Congress, they have already, you know, waived off farm loans worth around

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.720
[Guest 1]: 8000-9000 crores.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.720
[Amit Varma]: If I'm not wrong, the agitation was started by the BJP.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.720
[Guest 2]: So regardless, I mean, such populist policies really cut across parties.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:05.080
[Guest 2]: It's easy, you know, all you have to do is just decide, I mean, there is no, I mean,

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.720
[Guest 2]: you know that, you know, you will be able to borrow because the central government is

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.720
[Amit Varma]: backing you.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.760
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, you know, it's competitive populism.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.560
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that drives it is that, you know, in the popular narrative, you can

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.840
[Amit Varma]: easily have people asking you that, bhaiya ki jab corporate itne NPAs hai, if you can

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:25.280
[Amit Varma]: give 5000 crore to say Ambani, I'm just picking a figure off the top of my head, then why

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.080
[Amit Varma]: not these poor farmers, they are suffering after all.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.080
[Guest 2]: What do you feel about that logic?

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:33.400
[Guest 2]: I mean, I mean, it's, I mean, the logic doesn't make any sense.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.520
[Guest 2]: I mean, at the end of the day, you know, you're basically distorting the credit culture.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:45.440
[Guest 2]: I mean, the moment, you know, all these big industrialists are helped through, you know,

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.600
[Guest 2]: write offs, I mean, waive off is not the right word there.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:54.080
[Guest 2]: They also understand that, you know, next time when they go to borrow, the government

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:59.040
[Guest 2]: will ultimately come to their, not the government, but the bank will ultimately come to their

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.200
[Guest 2]: rescue because they're too big to fail.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:07.320
[Guest 2]: I mean, at the same level, it's, you know, when you sort of waive off farm loans, you

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.000
[Guest 2]: end up spoiling the credit culture.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.200
[Guest 2]: I mean, as Kumar's father's story sort of, you know, explained, yeah.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, my reply to the whataboutery always is that, you know, both are wrong.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, we're not saying that you should waive off corporate loans, you should, you

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.240
[Amit Varma]: know, we have an NPA problem, which we will discuss in a future episode, but you have

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:31.000
[Amit Varma]: to bring those guys to book, but A, not only are both wrong, but B, farm loan waivers don't

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
[Amit Varma]: even help farmers.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
[Guest 2]: No, they don't.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.760
[Guest 2]: I mean, you know, and the funny thing is, there are, there are solutions.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:44.240
[Guest 2]: It's just that, you know, nobody sort of has even bothered to look at them in a serious

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.240
[Guest 2]: way.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:50.440
[Guest 2]: I mean, you know, look at the fact that you have all these retail chains coming up.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:55.880
[Guest 2]: Now, why shouldn't they be allowed to deal directly with farmers or if not farmers, at

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.840
[Guest 2]: least with farmer cooperatives?

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:04.680
[Guest 2]: I mean, that is a solution which brings the farmer closer to the end consumer.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.640
[Guest 2]: And it wouldn't be a monopsony then as, you know, Kumar pointed out.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.920
[Guest 2]: I mean, you know, recently I came across a great story.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.360
[Guest 2]: So for a period of around six months, you know, there has been a farmer's market which

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.080
[Guest 2]: happens every Friday close to where I live.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:26.040
[Guest 2]: And these guys, you know, drive down with their vegetables from as far as, you know,

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.000
[Guest 2]: Satara and Pune and Nashik.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.560
[Guest 2]: And these vegetables are very fresh.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:35.560
[Guest 2]: And normally what happens is the vegetables you get in the normal market are chemically

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.820
[Guest 2]: aged.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.500
[Guest 2]: That doesn't happen there.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.760
[Guest 2]: And these farmers are very, you know, they're happy to drive down five hours to sell their

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.200
[Guest 2]: stuff because they get a good price for what they produce.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.800
[Guest 2]: So you know, I spoke to some of them and the point that came out was that for the first

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:55.840
[Guest 2]: time they have been able to set a price for what they are producing now, which was a great

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.480
[Guest 2]: thing for them.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:03.480
[Guest 2]: But then this is really not a solution because, you know, driving down five hours every week

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.920
[Guest 2]: and you cannot move a lot of green vegetables because by the time they sort of land up in

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.880
[Guest 2]: Bombay, they've already gone bad.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:14.840
[Guest 2]: So ultimately, you know, the solution is to bring the farmer closer to the consumer.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.560
[Guest 2]: And this has to happen in various ways.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.400
[Amit Varma]: Let me just clarify something for my listeners.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.760
[Amit Varma]: We've been using the term monopsony and so what monopsony basically means is just as

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.880
[Amit Varma]: in a monopoly, there is only one seller.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.640
[Amit Varma]: In a monopsony, there is only one buyer.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.280
[Amit Varma]: So the thing with agriculture here today is there's no free market when it comes to the

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.520
[Amit Varma]: farmer selling his produce.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.320
[Amit Varma]: You can't just go anywhere and set up shop and to any market or give your goods to any

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.320
[Amit Varma]: supplier.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.080
[Amit Varma]: It's all government controlled, it's all area control.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.960
[Amit Varma]: You can only sell at a specific place to a specific whatever and as you were just pointing

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.460
[Amit Varma]: out Vivek, the Maharashtra government, you know, loosened that up a little bit.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:55.520
[Guest 2]: Last year, they loosened it and this is a very good impact of that.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.360
[Guest 2]: But having said that, again, you know, a farmer, you know, growing stuff in Nasik shouldn't

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.800
[Amit Varma]: have to come all the way to Bombay.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.600
[Amit Varma]: And one interesting story again, which you, you know, told me when we were having coffee

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.000
[Amit Varma]: last was about how the big box retailers like Reliance and so on have actually tried to

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.720
[Amit Varma]: go to the farmers and buy produce directly from them.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:19.080
[Amit Varma]: But each of these territories are covered by each of these sort of local government

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.560
[Amit Varma]: markets are sort of controlled by different political parties.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.200
[Guest 2]: So it becomes very difficult.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.080
[Amit Varma]: It becomes simply very difficult in the same nonsense.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.320
[Guest 1]: So the reason that farmer has to drive from six hours from Nasik to, you know, a market

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.160
[Guest 1]: in Prabhadevi.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:40.080
[Guest 1]: So it's that that reason does not exist because of, you know, they are irrational, so to say,

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.080
[Unknown]: they want to drive down.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's just because you haven't allowed the market, you know, there's no choice for

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.040
[Guest 1]: them but to drive down, you know, if they want to get a better price.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.680
[Guest 1]: In fact, you know, they will drive down to Ahmedabad if someone is buying at a good price.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.400
[Guest 2]: And you know, the funny thing is, so I also happened to ask them as to whether they are

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.000
[Guest 2]: able to sell all their produce through these markets.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.280
[Guest 2]: And they said no, I mean, you know, only a very small part of the produce is sold, you

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.720
[Guest 2]: know, through these farmers markets and they have to ultimately go back to the, you know,

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.080
[Guest 2]: the agent who deals with the APMC.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:17.080
[Guest 2]: So it's not, you know, I mean, this is a solution at a very, very small level.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.600
[Guest 2]: You know, the other point I wanted to make was that, you know, instead of promoting farm

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.200
[Guest 2]: loan waivers, we should be promoting crop insurance, which is also, I mean, if you look

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:35.600
[Guest 2]: at data, you know, over the last three years, I think crop insurance as a portion of, you

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:42.240
[Guest 2]: know, what has been farmed, the area that is under, which has been sown is around 26%.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:48.440
[Guest 2]: Now, this is a very extremely low number, I mean, it's gone up from some 20 to 23% to

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.440
[Guest 2]: 26%.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:56.040
[Guest 2]: Now, crop insurance is something which needs to be, you know, promoted, and farmers need

00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.000
[Guest 2]: to be made aware of this concept, which is…

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.160
[Amit Varma]: And what are the barriers which stop it from happening?

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.160
[Guest 2]: I really don't know.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:10.680
[Guest 2]: I mean, I guess it's a matter of communication, getting the communication right and, you know,

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.440
[Guest 2]: having the institutions to push it through.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.080
[Amit Varma]: I mean, interestingly, like a few episodes ago, I spoke to Karthik Shashidhar on futures

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.000
[Amit Varma]: markets in agriculture, which either they are not allowed to trade in future markets

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.440
[Guest 2]: or all kinds of restrictions and the whole point was that is again another way of a farmer

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.680
[Guest 2]: being able to hedge his risk.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:35.360
[Guest 2]: So in fact, if you look at the entire agri-derivative market in India, it is not for the farmer,

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.040
[Guest 2]: it is basically for the speculator and, you know, there are no farmers there.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:44.440
[Guest 2]: I mean, any market needs its, you know, there, I mean, obviously, every market needs speculators

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.600
[Guest 2]: for it to operate efficiently, but you need the genuine guys as well.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.600
[Guest 1]: So…

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.840
[Guest 1]: And here the farmers as a speculator are not participating.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.720
[Guest 1]: The farmers are also speculators, except they are not, the real, the ones who should be

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.880
[Amit Varma]: participating are the ones who are not, you know, left out of the, out of this.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.840
[Amit Varma]: So to get back to the subject of the episode, which is farm loan waivers, let me, let me

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.280
[Amit Varma]: just try to sum up some of the unseen effects, which you've discussed and tell me if I missed

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.280
[Amit Varma]: anything.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.280
[Amit Varma]: Sure.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.280
[Amit Varma]: Unseen effect number one is moral hazard.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:18.520
[Amit Varma]: It basically incentivizes people to not pay back their loans, and it punishes those who

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.520
[Amit Varma]: pay.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.760
[Amit Varma]: So essentially, and because it continues every election cycle, it's just…

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.440
[Guest 1]: It destroys the credit discipline of the market.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:30.880
[Amit Varma]: Number two, it is essentially a redistribution of wealth from the people at large to farmers.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.680
[Amit Varma]: And it's a redistribution, not just directly, but in a number of different ways.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:39.080
[Amit Varma]: So as you pointed out, Vivek, that it might well be the case now that our fiscal deficit

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.720
[Amit Varma]: goes up and the government, because it is funding these waivers, has to borrow more.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.340
[Amit Varma]: But that also, down the line, affects the borrowing rate for private parties.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:51.400
[Amit Varma]: And if they borrow at a higher rate, that cost is then passed on to consumers.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.520
[Amit Varma]: It's just that it's not very clearly measurable.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.520
[Amit Varma]: It's not measurable.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.520
[Amit Varma]: It's an unseen effect.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.800
[Amit Varma]: And at the margins, there might be businesses which don't open up or run at all because

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.800
[Amit Varma]: of that.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.760
[Amit Varma]: So it has an impact all the way down the line.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.180
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, it's a negative sum game, you could say.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.100
[Amit Varma]: These are the two main unseen effects.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.600
[Amit Varma]: Any others that you can think of?

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.600
[Guest 2]: No.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I guess that sort of summarizes it.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.200
[Amit Varma]: Which is pretty huge, actually.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.200
[Amit Varma]: It's all-encompassing.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.800
[Amit Varma]: One final question.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.160
[Amit Varma]: So farm loan waivers have happened.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.640
[Amit Varma]: Farmers have got waivers.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.640
[Guest 2]: What's next?

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.220
[Guest 2]: Okay, so I recently wrote this piece on how, I mean, this was a very speculative piece

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:31.560
[Guest 2]: on how mudra loan waivers should be the next big thing.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.560
[Amit Varma]: What is a mudra loan?

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:37.360
[Guest 2]: So mudra loan are these, you know, small loans, you know, given by banks.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:45.100
[Guest 2]: And over the last two financial years, around 7.46 crore borrowers have been given loans

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.200
[Guest 2]: close to 3.2 lakh crore.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:53.760
[Guest 2]: And I guess this year, the target is to sort of give loans of around 2.44 lakh crore.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:59.880
[Guest 2]: So if you add by 2019, this should easily be, you know, 7 to 8 lakh crore.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:05.120
[Guest 2]: So any politician, you know, willing to sort of, you know, stick his neck out and, you

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:11.720
[Guest 2]: know, gain popularity, he should essentially be sort of promising, you know, weaving off

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.880
[Guest 2]: of mudra loans.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:19.400
[Guest 2]: Because it will, you know, benefit if, I mean, for a lack of a better word, a lot of people

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.400
[Amit Varma]: quote, unquote benefit.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.400
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.400
[Guest 1]: Benefit.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.200
[Guest 1]: That would be like committing a suicide for the economy.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.200
[Guest 2]: But then, you know, if you're willing to weave off, I mean, let's say, you know, you may

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:34.120
[Guest 2]: not weave off the entire amount, you can weave off 25%, 50% or what.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.760
[Amit Varma]: Once I really hope that if they haven't got this idea already, none of them are listening

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.040
[Amit Varma]: to this podcast.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:43.400
[Amit Varma]: And in case they're listening in, I'd like to tell them that dudes, include me in this

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.000
[Amit Varma]: Ponzi scheme, you will have my vote for sure.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.400
[Amit Varma]: If you include podcaster loan waivers, that's the next big idea.
