00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.940
[Amit Varma]: It is said that shared experiences can bring us closer. By the same token, can shared suffering

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.740
[Amit Varma]: make us more empathetic? There has never been a period of time in our history when so many

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.760
[Amit Varma]: have suffered together. At some point in the last few months, and perhaps in just the last

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.540
[Amit Varma]: few weeks, every family in India has known of loss or grief or anger in some form or

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.160
[Amit Varma]: the other. Every day, anodyne phrases that one just said reflexively have taken on deeper

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.500
[Amit Varma]: meaning. These days, when I say, how are you? Or is everything okay? Or take care? I mean

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.980
[Amit Varma]: those words. There is so much bad news around me that I should be numb by now. But I am

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.120
[Amit Varma]: the opposite of numb. Every loss I hear about makes all other losses blaze within me. And

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.040
[Amit Varma]: I see that most people I speak to feel the same. We are alive to the pain of other people.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.960
[Amit Varma]: We are not islands anymore. And here I must ask the question, what will we do with this

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.280
[Amit Varma]: outpouring of empathy? Instead of just feeling bad for others, is there any way that we can

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.720
[Unknown]: help them?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.920
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.000
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.480
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is one of my favorite thinkers in this

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.520
[Amit Varma]: country, Ashwin Mahesh. But Ashwin is not just a thinker, he's also a doer. Listeners

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.880
[Amit Varma]: of the show will remember him from episode 160, where we spoke about participatory democracy.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.180
[Amit Varma]: And Ashwin outlined the many different ways in which citizens can empower themselves by

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.600
[Amit Varma]: working with the state. He himself has been at the forefront of much civic activism and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.160
[Amit Varma]: action and he kicked it into a new gear in this pandemic. There were immediate problems

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.700
[Amit Varma]: that needed to be addressed, people needing food, medicine, oxygen. And there were deeper

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.880
[Amit Varma]: problems behind them that Ashwin has already been working to solve for many years now.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.200
[Amit Varma]: I spoke a few months ago with Ashwin's colleague in Mumbai, Ruben Mascarenhas, one of the founders

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.280
[Amit Varma]: of the Khana Chahiye movement that fed hungry people during the lockdown last year, especially

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.560
[Amit Varma]: the migrant workers abandoned by both their employers and the state. Ruben's been active

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.880
[Amit Varma]: helping people in Mumbai with medicines and beds during the second wave. And Ashwin's

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.120
[Amit Varma]: been organising that kind of relief work at scale, so much so that even governments have

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.400
[Amit Varma]: reached out to his network to get things done. I was delighted to have Ashwin on the show

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.800
[Amit Varma]: to chat about his experiences and learnings. And as it happens, there are also threads

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.040
[Amit Varma]: of a continuing discussion here. In my last wildly popular episode with Karthik Muralidharan

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.520
[Amit Varma]: on India's healthcare, you might have heard my scepticism about getting the state to do

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.760
[Amit Varma]: the few things it should do. To me, society will have to solve its own problems. We cannot

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.360
[Amit Varma]: rely on the dysfunctional state. Karthik argued with me then on the importance of working

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.680
[Amit Varma]: with the state and cited Ashwin's words from previous episodes to back up his argument.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.120
[Amit Varma]: And in this episode, Ashwin carries that argument forward. I love the work both of them do.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.480
[Amit Varma]: I think it's important. I hope many young people get inspired by them. But before we

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.960
[Amit Varma]: get to my conversation with Ashwin, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.960
[Amit Varma]: The Second Coming by William Butler Yeats

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.840
[Amit Varma]: Turning and turning in the widening jaya, the falcon cannot hear the falconer. Things

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.880
[Amit Varma]: fall apart, the centre cannot hold. Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. The blood-drenched

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.120
[Amit Varma]: tide is loosed, and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned. The best lack all

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.120
[Amit Varma]: conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.040
[Amit Varma]: This poem by Yeats could be about so many things. And most of all, it can be about revolution.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.960
[Amit Varma]: The centre cannot hold, the people rise up. What was once taken for granted is now washed

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.960
[Amit Varma]: away. Revolutions, both good and bad, have always

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.360
[Amit Varma]: fascinated me. And if you feel that way as well, I have a recommendation for you. Head

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.560
[Amit Varma]: on over to the sponsors of this episode, The Great Courses Plus at thegreatcoursesplus.com

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.180
[Amit Varma]: and check out a course called The Great Revolutions of Modern History taught by Lynn Ann Hartnett.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.520
[Amit Varma]: and democracy and gives you an in-depth look at the various revolutions in America, Russia,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.680
[Amit Varma]: France, China and so on. There's lots to learn from this history, not just from the way events

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.140
[Amit Varma]: unfolded, not just from the ideas that inspired them, but also from what they reveal about

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.080
[Amit Varma]: both society and human nature. And this is just one of the many great courses on this

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.040
[Amit Varma]: Ashwin, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.200
[Guest]: Amit, always good to be back with you.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.680
[Amit Varma]: So you know, before we get down to the subject at hand, we spoke last three or four months

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.840
[Amit Varma]: ago. And at that point in time, I asked you how the pandemic was for you. And we almost

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.360
[Amit Varma]: spoke of it in the past tense, it felt like it was getting over and the worst is behind

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.920
[Amit Varma]: us. And now here we are. And these have been like incredibly difficult times for all of

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.200
[Amit Varma]: us in various different ways. I'll ask you the same question again, that I think I started

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.680
[Amit Varma]: that episode with, how have the last few months been for you?

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.680
[Guest]: It's hard to say, obviously, it goes up and down based on what is happening in any one

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.320
[Guest]: geography, right? I live in this city. So the experience of it is really what's happening

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:56.200
[Guest]: in this city. The rest of it is what you hear and read and things like that. And then the

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.840
[Guest]: second kind of experience is whether you yourself have had COVID or your family members have

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.000
[Guest]: had COVID. And therefore, it comes close to you and your friends have had COVID. And then

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.480
[Guest]: as the months go on and on, inevitably, someone, you know, has died. And clearly, that has

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.120
[Guest]: been a sad thing. It's sad when anyone dies. And it's sad when so many people die on such

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.680
[Guest]: a scale. But it's sad when someone you know, in a different way, you know what I mean?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.400
[Guest]: Someone you know, personally, when they decide in a different way, not because you know them,

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.320
[Guest]: but because you know more about them. That's all it is. I really was sad about Sunil Jain's

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.560
[Guest]: death, for example, the other day, I think he was just one of those nice guys. And things

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.520
[Guest]: like that, some of my friends went through near miss experience, you know, when it came

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:55.040
[Guest]: very close. Some of my friends have had multiple family members who have died. There's no good

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.280
[Guest]: way to think about it. My wife and mother-in-law had COVID. And that was kind of an interesting

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:08.880
[Guest]: experience isolation, quarantine. Fortunately, they had a mild case of it. And I think, I

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.960
[Guest]: just, I feel like I already had COVID several times. So I haven't figured out that part.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.000
[Guest]: There's no proper diagnosis of it by anybody yet. But just the way we went through the

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.520
[Guest]: last 15 months, there were many, many times when I told myself, this must be it. And I'm

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.760
[Guest]: sure all of us have that kind of experience as well. It's been sad, to tell you the truth.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:36.560
[Guest]: It's also been hectic. Because as the thing started to get out of hand, you can't stand

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.120
[Guest]: and watch, you have to do something. And getting into it means that there's no getting into

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.840
[Guest]: it in a small way. I mean, if you get into it in a small way, every little bit helps,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:52.340
[Guest]: I don't deny that. But from certain vantage points, there's no way of getting into it

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:59.720
[Guest]: in a small way. So I've sort of dived headfirst into it, knowing fully well that it was the

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:06.120
[Guest]: shallow end of the pool. For all of us, it is the shallow end of the pool. And diving

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:12.080
[Guest]: is the only way to get in, in some way. It is what it is. I know I say that a lot. But

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.880
[Guest]: it's tragic. It's sad. But it's necessary now to just get on with it, whatever is needed

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.000
[Guest]: for intervention. And at some level, in the last two weeks in particular, I've just clouded

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.200
[Guest]: out my mind, saying, I don't want to know anything else. I don't want to know the news.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.040
[Guest]: I don't want to know even the things that I would normally follow. There's a certain

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:40.000
[Guest]: kind of silence even in the house. You know what I mean? Everybody is in WFH mode. The

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.240
[Guest]: kids are schooling from home, obviously. But there's still a kind of silence in the house.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:53.240
[Guest]: It's the silence of getting on with doing what needs to be done, and just choosing and

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:59.520
[Guest]: not choosing not to be able to look at anything else in some way. It's sort of personal in

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:08.240
[Guest]: a way that I can't really explain. It's scary. It's, it's odd. But you know, these are not

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:15.600
[Guest]: normal times, clearly. But I think even emotionally, these are not normal times.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, one way and you know, we'll explore different angles of this today, like how we

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.560
[Amit Varma]: look differently at the state or society or markets or whatever. But what has kind of

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.000
[Amit Varma]: struck me just thinking aloud is that people have been forced to look inwards a little

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.480
[Amit Varma]: bit more in a number of different facets. And I think aloud here, for example, for example,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.160
[Amit Varma]: life and death, where we almost live under the illusion that we will live forever, almost

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.920
[Amit Varma]: an illusion of mortality at a rational level, we know we will die. But we behave as if you're

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.320
[Amit Varma]: going to live forever. And equally for our loved ones and the people around us, we behave

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.840
[Amit Varma]: as if they're going to be there till one day somebody is not and that's a shock, but you

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.920
[Amit Varma]: get over it, you get on with it. And for most of us, the frequency of that happening is

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.840
[Amit Varma]: low enough that we can cope that it just seems and a break from normalcy instead of normalcy

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.760
[Amit Varma]: itself. And I think that's one of the ways in which we which we have been forced to reexamine

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.520
[Amit Varma]: like I've heard people in their 30s discussing how they're going to make a will and all of

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.860
[Amit Varma]: that and these are not things that one normally thinks about, you know. Another aspect in

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.520
[Amit Varma]: which I think it has changed is in the way that we look at relationships, maybe relationships

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.280
[Amit Varma]: with the ones who are gone, maybe relationships with the ones who are still here, where you

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.720
[Amit Varma]: realize that you cannot take anything for granted. And of course, the pandemic throws

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.080
[Amit Varma]: families together because of the lockdown forcing them to sort of stick around. And

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, that can be unpleasant for some people, especially, you know, I keep hearing

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.600
[Amit Varma]: horror stories of women who are already in bad marriages, but it's okay, they don't have

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.080
[Amit Varma]: to spend so much time. And suddenly, you're at home with the other person and there's

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.760
[Amit Varma]: no escape, you have to face up to what's not good about that. And equally, there are many

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.280
[Amit Varma]: cases where you come to appreciate the other person so much more. For those of us who are

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.200
[Amit Varma]: fortunate, that's great. Another way is not just reexamining your relationship with other

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.720
[Amit Varma]: people, but your relationship with the world around you. You know, you kind of look a little

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.880
[Amit Varma]: closer at that. And by the world around you, I mean other people outside your immediate

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.280
[Amit Varma]: circles who you might not have noticed, you know, in your bubble, and you notice them

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.800
[Amit Varma]: a bit more. And then finally, your relationship with life where you question the things that

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.600
[Amit Varma]: you do. And you wonder about the reasons why you do them. Like so much of ambition seems

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.640
[Amit Varma]: so shallow and meaningless, because the question is, you know, even if I get that, so what?

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.760
[Amit Varma]: So then I think the larger questions come up of how do you live your life? How do you

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:40.640
[Amit Varma]: how do you find meaning and maximize what there is? Is any of this stuff that you've

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.440
[Amit Varma]: thought about as well?

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.440
[Guest]: I don't agree with the last part. I'm going to come back to that. But I also wanted to

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.800
[Guest]: say it's not only about the people that you know, it's even the people that you hear of.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.320
[Guest]: For instance, you know, when I heard about your loss, I said, well, I don't know. I don't

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.280
[Guest]: know your father. I never knew him. But it's still your loss. And in some ways, even your

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.680
[Guest]: loss is my loss. You know what I mean? Because it's a kind of extended kinship. So it's not

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.200
[Guest]: always people that you know, you just hear about it. It's really sad. It's just one of

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:19.600
[Guest]: those things. But I also have come to the conclusion that if we are going to get through

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:26.120
[Guest]: this, I don't think in the short term, we can count on a different kind of behavior

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:32.200
[Guest]: from people to get through this. It's not going to happen again and again and again.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:38.480
[Guest]: I think what you were saying, if I can put it in a more sort of, I won't call it layman,

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:46.160
[Guest]: in more direct language, you would think, in the face of a pandemic, will you change

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.720
[Guest]: your behavior? That's the question you're asking. And if that thing is not going to

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.840
[Guest]: make you change your behavior and rethink the meaning of life and the purpose of life

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:06.840
[Guest]: and all that, is that not enough to tip you over into a different way of thinking? And

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:15.360
[Guest]: I'm terrified that the answer is no. For most people, it's not. I'll give you an example.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:21.720
[Guest]: During the last couple of weeks in particular, when it's really been a scramble to say, do

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:27.520
[Guest]: what you can, where you can, round up as many people to do what is possible, and we'll discuss

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:36.880
[Guest]: all that. It's not really a simple thing. But you know, especially in this last two

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.840
[Guest]: weeks when it's been such a scramble, you come into many, many conversations where you're

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:49.120
[Guest]: talking to people about the urgency of the intervention. I have a helicopter swirling

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.120
[Guest]: overhead.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I can hear that. In a previous episode with Gautam Menon, there were ambulances outside

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:00.160
[Amit Varma]: which readers commented on. I think a helicopter is a less sad sound. No, no, no worries. Continue.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.360
[Amit Varma]: I think it's fine.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.120
[Guest]: So there have been many instances where you're sort of sitting in front of a person, you've

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:13.480
[Guest]: spent whatever time explaining the phenomenal urgency of what needs to be done today. And

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:22.000
[Guest]: you hear an answer, which is completely like, you know, they've not heard you at all. Right?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.640
[Guest]: I mean, our executive committee meets every 15 days. We'll come back with a decision and

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:34.640
[Guest]: then you'll have an answer by the end of the month. I understand the processes that organizations

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:41.440
[Guest]: set up. But I'm just, you know, especially among people with the capacity to help, I

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.400
[Guest]: feel if they were not already the helpful type to begin with, I don't think they're

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:53.520
[Guest]: going to change pandemic or not. And that's actually the saddest part of it. And what

00:14:53.520 --> 00:15:00.760
[Guest]: that tells me that the problem is not only the pandemic. The problem is that we have

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:09.160
[Guest]: allowed a certain kind of society to emerge in which even in the face of a pandemic, you

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:17.560
[Guest]: would not fundamentally do too much different. And I think whatever be the nature of the

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:24.200
[Guest]: response, you have to weave this knowledge into that response and build some kind of

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:30.880
[Guest]: a strategy for addressing that as well. I think it has become too easy to accept that

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:36.560
[Guest]: the world is screwed up. Other people are screwed up. Zamana karav hai. And everybody

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:42.920
[Guest]: else is part of that true, but it doesn't apply to me. And because zamana karav hai,

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:50.720
[Guest]: I really can't expect much, nor do I have to give anything into that. It's a kind of,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:56.840
[Guest]: I think it's a dissonance of some kind, partly, but it's also, I think it's scary in different

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:02.200
[Guest]: ways. And as we go along, I think some of the anecdotes that I'll give you will give

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:09.960
[Guest]: you that sense of it. But I've seen people give extraordinary efforts in response to

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:19.680
[Guest]: the crisis around them. And the only thing I can say is that they were always heroes.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:26.840
[Guest]: It's just more people are seeing them as heroes now, but even around them, if people were

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:34.120
[Guest]: not inclined to be heroic or even compassionate and do something to help, they're not going

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:41.440
[Guest]: to do that even in a pandemic, number one. But there is one group of people who are inclined

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:50.120
[Guest]: to do the right things for the right reasons. And for whatever reason, their connections

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:57.480
[Guest]: to doing things for the right reasons, for various outcomes, were never very good. So

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:03.400
[Guest]: they did what they could locally. If they had a domestic helper, they would pay them

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.600
[Guest]: a decent wage. If they knew somebody in the neighborhood who was on hard times, they would

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:13.200
[Guest]: help them out. They were inclined to help, but they were inclined to help at a very personal

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:21.080
[Guest]: level. And while that is genuinely a good thing, they had never sort of had the opportunity

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:27.080
[Guest]: or the capacity, I'm going to say, partly out of benefit of doubt, that they weren't

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:34.400
[Guest]: part of a larger system of helping. I think that's what it is, that if more people get

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:41.320
[Guest]: connected to a larger system of helping, because we are now trying to help in such a large

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:50.120
[Guest]: way, I would see that as the most powerful outcome. And that is also why we are being

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:55.040
[Guest]: very careful in a lot of the relief work that I'm sort of part of, at least, to say that

00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:02.680
[Guest]: the system of people helping each other has to be at the heart of how we respond. It is

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:09.080
[Guest]: not a techno-managerial problem. It is a socio-political problem. And therefore, you have to respond

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:15.560
[Guest]: like it's a socio-political problem. You have to accept that we are like them and they are

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:24.600
[Guest]: like us, both ways. And I think that has to be in the middle of any response. And genuinely,

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:32.560
[Guest]: I feel a lot of people are inspired to take that extra step. They are inclined to be helpful.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:38.640
[Guest]: They've done it in small ways in the past. But when they see the opportunity to do something

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:44.800
[Guest]: really big, and when it clicks in their mind that this is not just a linear extension of

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:53.000
[Guest]: what I've been doing, but really, it sort of helps me do more, and also sort of cements

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.880
[Guest]: in my mind an imagination of what I could be and how I should be living, they do make

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.960
[Guest]: that effort. But they were already inclined to do some good things in their own ways and

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:12.960
[Guest]: were doing it quietly. Those who are trapped, either individually or procedurally, in disinclination,

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:18.200
[Guest]: it's very hard to yank them out of that space. And therefore, one of the really important

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.040
[Guest]: things in any relief mission is to be able to spot that in the first five minutes.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:30.360
[Guest]: I mean, if the guy is not going to do anything, you have to move on as quickly as possible.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:36.440
[Guest]: And I should also say, for this reason, because it's so socio-political, and let's leave the

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:42.800
[Guest]: political, we'll come to the political, because it's so social as well, we sort of broke it

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:51.080
[Guest]: down into channels of social connection. There is one channel from the development sector

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:59.520
[Guest]: itself, people whose lives anyway reflect an ongoing commitment to helping others in

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:06.960
[Guest]: some way. Then there's a second set of people who have capacity to do something at an individual

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:12.640
[Guest]: level. I'm a professional in some company. Yes, I could talk to my boss about doing something

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.520
[Guest]: from the company, but I could also talk to the CSR team and do some other things. But

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.200
[Guest]: you know what? Before all that, right now, this minute, I can write a check for three

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.320
[Guest]: lakh rupees or whatever. There's a limit to that, but it's my capacity. I can decide right

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.640
[Guest]: now, I can do it right away. There's one set of people who are doing a very interesting

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:37.440
[Guest]: exercise of reaching out to others in that capacity and trying to build that network.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:45.160
[Guest]: Leave the rest, just get on with this business of building this channel and just do it, talk

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.880
[Guest]: to others like you, who you think will do it. And many of these people are also in middle

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.960
[Guest]: management and other leadership roles in companies. So they can organize other kinds of support.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.720
[Guest]: They can find tech volunteers. They can find, you know, some of them are in companies with

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.880
[Guest]: multiple offices in multiple cities. They can get people from different offices to be

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.800
[Guest]: part of what you are doing. They have some other capacity as a result of their professional

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:14.720
[Guest]: role play. And when they make the decision to do something themselves first, there's

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.680
[Guest]: a way in which it naturally extends to the ecosystem around them. So that's a second

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:25.000
[Guest]: channel. So you have the development channel and then you have the individual empathetic

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.560
[Guest]: professional channel. These are both really good if you ask me. And then you can always

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.440
[Guest]: build a crowdsourcing fundraising strategy on both of these channels fairly easily. It's

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.920
[Guest]: not that difficult. And for something like this, you don't have to explain the problem

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:45.040
[Guest]: very much. So it's manageable in that sense. Then there is the larger money, which is coming

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:51.600
[Guest]: from institutions in the form of, you know, organized support. It could be CSR money.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.960
[Guest]: It could be, you know, procurement of some things that are needed. There's a lot of equipment

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:05.440
[Guest]: that needs to be procured. That is almost as slow or as quick as it has always been.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:11.200
[Guest]: That's not moving any faster as far as I can tell. A lot of them will tell you that we

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:16.640
[Guest]: are doing something for COVID relief. And I think that's true also. I'm not going to

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.240
[Guest]: say that they are lying, but they're not doing it any faster than they would have done it

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:28.560
[Guest]: for any other development proposal that was sitting in front of you. The turnaround of

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.720
[Guest]: that is not anywhere close to what it could be, given the potential of that money to make

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:40.320
[Guest]: a difference. There is, however, one group within that, I wouldn't call it the professional

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.720
[Guest]: corporate sector, but there's another set of people who are owners of their businesses.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:50.900
[Guest]: Or they are effectively, de facto, they are owners of their businesses and can therefore

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:56.220
[Guest]: make decisions on money a lot faster. These actually tend to be more industrial companies

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:02.640
[Guest]: rather than the service companies in some sense. Those guys tend to make decisions much

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.080
[Guest]: faster. And it's also a lot easier for them because they connect with this welfare of

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:14.040
[Guest]: my workers logic a little more directly. Some of their focus and preference is to help locally

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:19.240
[Guest]: where they are, which is understandable. But also some of them are saying, look, I don't

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:25.640
[Guest]: mind if you want to distribute some of my capacity more widely. So that's one part of

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:31.280
[Guest]: the professional industrial type thing. But the last one that I'll talk about in this

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.720
[Guest]: sequence is the larger donors who are essentially saying, we need to solve the procurement channels

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:43.200
[Guest]: here. We've got to figure out how to get 4,000 oxygen plants into the country or get them

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.920
[Guest]: built in the country. We have to figure out how to connect the zeolite supplies. We have

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:53.160
[Guest]: to figure out how to have enhanced vaccine production capacity inside the country. We

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:59.120
[Guest]: have to figure out how testing and genome sequencing can keep pace with what's actually

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:04.080
[Guest]: happening on the ground. And there are weaknesses in all of this. And the weaknesses are not

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.760
[Guest]: small. The weaknesses are like, the need is 100 and we are doing three or something like

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:15.800
[Guest]: that. It's like massive gaps. So the big donors are looking at that, but they're also trying

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.920
[Guest]: to figure out what is a spectrum of allocation that makes sense when you have a lot of money.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.320
[Guest]: Because they realize that if you have a lot of money to, let's say, buy oxygen plants,

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.800
[Guest]: yes, it does fill one part of the need if you say, I'll commit to buying 500 oxygen

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.280
[Guest]: plants. But there are lots and lots of things around. You don't really have the technicians

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.640
[Guest]: in place to support 500 oxygen plants. So at the very least, you'd have to make investments

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:46.600
[Guest]: in a manpower strategy. Who can crack this manpower strategy? Then you start to ask around

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:52.720
[Guest]: and you say, OK, can Manish help? Can Urban Company help? You start to ask the questions

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:58.360
[Guest]: that are these complementary things. The good news about these large pools of capital for

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:05.080
[Guest]: this relief work is that they're reasonably well-connected across multiple sectors, partly

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:11.840
[Guest]: through the investment firms, but even otherwise. And there's a reasonable age group in which

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:17.360
[Guest]: a lot of them are. Some would say, I should really be saying a lot of us are. But in a

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:24.560
[Guest]: way, it's easier to say, look, we've all run companies. Therefore, we know A, B, C, D.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.440
[Guest]: We know which kind of capacity connects to another kind of capacity. Lots of people have

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.680
[Guest]: raised money from investors. You know who those investors have also raised money from.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.760
[Guest]: Tap those channels, figure out how to move the conversations along, and figure out what

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:43.400
[Guest]: the deployment strategy for money should be in a way that gives you some confidence in

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.640
[Guest]: what you know. But there are also important differences in that. Some are doing it this

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.760
[Guest]: way. Some are saying, in all of this, we have to work with the government. And therefore,

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:59.880
[Guest]: we'll go through with the government channels. Some are saying both things, that it's complicated

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.680
[Guest]: to work with the government channels. Also, there's a certain amount of worry that the

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.160
[Guest]: outcomes that you're pursuing may be compromised if you go through some of those channels.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.640
[Guest]: And some are saying, look, yes, you have to sort of accept that because the channel is

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:18.240
[Guest]: large if you work with the government. And some inefficiency, some loss even, is acceptable

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:23.480
[Guest]: if you're going to work with that. It's better to get something done in scale than to look

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:28.440
[Guest]: for the ideal there. There are details, and there are details in these types of things.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:33.680
[Guest]: So this is the other category. There's one other category, which is the government itself.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.280
[Guest]: I mean, let's think of the government as money for the moment. You know what I mean? Government

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:45.560
[Guest]: as capital or government as intervener. And we separate that from government as government.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.160
[Guest]: Government as money has its own challenges, because in theory, they have a fair amount

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:54.360
[Guest]: of capital, but of money. But in practice, that money, there's a lot of pressure on that

00:26:54.360 --> 00:27:01.520
[Guest]: money to do so many other things, even within the framework of a pandemic, protect livelihoods,

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:07.080
[Guest]: figure out the vaccine strategy. There's a lot of stuff. There's a pressure on that money.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:12.360
[Guest]: And the health care system in particular is overwhelmed. And most people, when they hear

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:18.720
[Guest]: this word overwhelmed, they think the hospital normally can take 50 people, but it's getting

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:24.400
[Guest]: 18. That's actually not the level of overwhelming that's going on. The hospital can take 50,

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:35.280
[Guest]: they're getting 350. It's not 2x. It's 7x and 8x in many places. There are PHCs, primary

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:41.120
[Guest]: health centers, where people call to say, in my jurisdiction, there are 2,500 positive

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:49.440
[Guest]: cases of COVID. And I'm the only worker in this health center for a variety of reasons.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.720
[Guest]: And typically, that last worker is a woman. It's only going to be a few days before her

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.760
[Guest]: husband, her father says, you can't go. That's all there is. If this is the situation out

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:06.840
[Guest]: there, you can't go to work, right? Or you're going to get COVID anyway. It's better you

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:13.160
[Guest]: get fake COVID. These kinds of realities will start to emerge if you're not careful in this

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:19.040
[Guest]: stuff. And some of it, we are seeing that. I'm not making up those realities. These are

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:25.480
[Guest]: not just possibilities. You see them. So the government's money is slow to execute because

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:33.160
[Guest]: of the procurement rules in government. And when you bypass them also, it's not easy.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:39.320
[Guest]: The government's procurement of what is needed, whether it's people or anything else, it works

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:45.760
[Guest]: on the assumption that people always want to sell to you. Because you're a bulk buyer.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.560
[Guest]: You know what I mean? You put out a tender for something. Typically, you'll find somebody

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:56.280
[Guest]: bidding. But in a situation like this, when the thing you're trying to bid a buyer, whether

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:02.120
[Guest]: it's an oxygen plant or a concentrator or whatever it is, or a ventilator, that thing

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.880
[Guest]: is in such demand, not just in India. The Brazilians want it. The Peruvians want it.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:12.160
[Guest]: The Africans want it. Everybody wants the thing that you're trying to buy in scale,

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.680
[Guest]: massive volumes, right? So if you put out a tender, nothing will happen. Nobody will

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:22.720
[Guest]: even bother, right? Sometimes you have to put out a really large tender. For example,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.880
[Guest]: there are districts now where they're saying, we'll hire pulmonologists on short-term 11-month

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:34.920
[Guest]: contracts at four lakhs a month, which is, you know, in the government sector, that's

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:40.680
[Guest]: pretty decent money. It's impressive money, I would even say, in the government sector.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.400
[Guest]: But in many scenarios, you're not actually going to see it. Maybe people will respond.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.240
[Guest]: Maybe the doctor making a lakh and a half, two lakh at a private hospital will think,

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.960
[Guest]: why not? Eleven months, I can do some stuff in a government hospital and make twice that

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.240
[Guest]: money. That might happen. But that's not going to add fundamental capacity. It's either he's

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.760
[Guest]: doing something in the private sector hospital or he's doing it in the public sector hospital.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:05.880
[Guest]: It's not an extra doctor. It's the same doctor. So this kind of money doesn't create rapid

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.800
[Guest]: manpower. That's a different problem. But in equipment, you can certainly do that. You

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:16.040
[Guest]: can certainly hire ten more things produced. But the bidding and tendering process is just

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:21.720
[Guest]: simply not there. You can even say, I will allow no-bid contracts to happen. I will allow

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.740
[Guest]: procurement to happen. But there's nobody in government who's gone out and procured

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:31.560
[Guest]: in that way, in a competitive way, by calling up a vendor, having that conversation, negotiating

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:37.680
[Guest]: the details. You will do this other part, all of that stuff. That's why their procurement

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:44.480
[Guest]: is slow. And so they need a little bit of handholding in that for the large purchases.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:49.200
[Guest]: So one of the ways in which you can make up for slow procurement is through bulk purchasing.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.880
[Guest]: So you say, look, it'll take me three weeks to figure out how to execute the thing, but

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:58.500
[Guest]: let's buy 300 of the things that we are buying instead of 10. So therefore, TKI makes up.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:04.000
[Guest]: Maybe some guy can do it really faster than me, but he can only buy 10 at a time. So you

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.320
[Guest]: catch up in the long run. But it also means that in the immediate term, you can't do anything.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:14.640
[Guest]: And if people are dying 4,000 a day, the reports are 4,000 a day. The actuals, I'm certain,

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.880
[Guest]: are not that number. You can't do anything in the near term because it takes you three

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:28.440
[Guest]: weeks to get organized. So these are the role players in how the response needs to be organized.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:35.800
[Guest]: And then there are these people creating new solutions. How do you create a 10-bed ICU

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:41.960
[Guest]: in a small geography? How do you create a new oxygen-generating plant? It'll take you

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:48.360
[Guest]: three months, but after that, you'll be able to produce five a day. And then the Maruti's

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.320
[Guest]: and the Linde's of the world who are trying to fix key pieces of the infrastructure. How

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.680
[Guest]: do you get the tankers in place, the supply in place? How do you create oxygen hubs? I

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:03.400
[Guest]: mean, the number of things that need to be done here is spectacular. I'll send you a

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:09.920
[Guest]: list of how we are bucketing the things that need to be done, right? What needs to be done

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.240
[Guest]: in the hospital? What needs to be done outside the hospital? What needs to be done in the

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.840
[Guest]: supply chain? What needs to be done for baseline healthcare itself? What needs to be done in

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:23.280
[Guest]: the genome companies? What needs to be done on the fundraising side? I mean, it's just,

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:29.000
[Guest]: it's a very, very large number of things that need to be done. And it's impossible really

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.360
[Guest]: from any vantage point to have a full picture of it, but it is possible to immerse yourself

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:41.920
[Guest]: in that effort and give yourself a chance to let that full picture fly past you, if

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.160
[Guest]: nothing else. So that every once in a while you see one piece of it and you say, okay,

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.560
[Guest]: here's something that I can do personally, because either I know how to make that connection

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.560
[Guest]: or somebody in this ecosystem knows how to make this connection.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:33:00.080
[Guest]: So this morning, for example, I talked to someone who was trying to build a large volunteer

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.280
[Guest]: organization, right? So look, one way of building a really large volunteer organization is to

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:09.280
[Guest]: pick a first problem for which people are naturally inclined to volunteer anyway. And

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:16.720
[Guest]: COVID is frankly a great jumping off point, if that's your goal. And so you say, okay,

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.400
[Guest]: you're trying to build a national volunteer organization, COVID or no COVID, that's what

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:27.280
[Guest]: you're trying to do. Here's a way of getting that started. Do this first for COVID relief,

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:32.920
[Guest]: right? And if you're interested, their goal now marries with the immediate goal of providing

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:38.560
[Guest]: relief for COVID. So you have to find the pieces that are naturally

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:45.720
[Guest]: inclined to do something that forms part of the total picture anyway, and get them neatly

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:50.320
[Guest]: hooked into something that they can do immediately in a way that provides strength to the immediate

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.560
[Guest]: effort and actually gives them a greater chance of doing what they want to do in the long

00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:00.600
[Guest]: run. If you pull that exercise off, you can build the channels much faster.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.020
[Amit Varma]: So in the context of COVID, you've laid out a very fascinating look at all the different

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.960
[Amit Varma]: categories of people who are helping, whether it's development sector, whether it's large

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:14.640
[Amit Varma]: donors, whether it's individuals and corporations, middle management, who can, you know, leverage

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.920
[Amit Varma]: capacities in their companies, besides contributing individually, it's business owners, it's a

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.680
[Amit Varma]: government, it's all of that. And equally, these are the people who are doing something.

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.880
[Amit Varma]: And there are many people who you're saying are outside of this, who are not really doing

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.440
[Amit Varma]: much and who won't, you know, before we go into the weeds, and I want to kind of spend

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.240
[Amit Varma]: the rest of the episode in the weeds with you talking about specifics and particulars,

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:39.800
[Amit Varma]: I first want to kind of ask a general question, which is sparked by something you said earlier,

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.600
[Amit Varma]: when you know, you were speaking about how you don't believe that how there are people

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.540
[Amit Varma]: who are inclined to help, and they will help anyway, but many people may not change their

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:52.680
[Amit Varma]: approach to helping. Now, I was looking back at some of the writing I had done during a

00:34:52.680 --> 00:35:00.000
[Amit Varma]: previous natural disaster, which was a tsunami in 2004, at the end of 2004. And at that time,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.560
[Amit Varma]: I traveled across the coast of Tamil Nadu with a friend of mine after it happened with

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.960
[Amit Varma]: a bunch of friends, we'd gone with a group trying to help out and I was kind of live

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.440
[Amit Varma]: blogging from there. And I was calling my series dispatches, the way Michael Hurr called

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:18.320
[Amit Varma]: his Vietnam thing dispatches. And my dispatch number 36 is titled the broader continuing

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:22.240
[Amit Varma]: disaster. And my main point there was that look, this is a disaster, the tsunami is a

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:28.920
[Amit Varma]: disaster. But a lot of the things that we are trying to sort of help out with our problems

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:33.520
[Amit Varma]: that have been with us forever, for example, a cyclone just hit Bombay, right? Now a cyclone

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.800
[Amit Varma]: will come, it will make some people homeless, and immediately there'll be relief for the

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.760
[Amit Varma]: homeless people. But the point is, millions of Indians are homeless anyway. For example,

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.720
[Amit Varma]: a migrant labor crisis will happen when the lockdown is called. And some really fine people

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:52.160
[Amit Varma]: will go out there sort of feeding people. But the point is that we've always had problem

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.640
[Amit Varma]: of hunger. In fact, we still do like in a column I wrote last year, I pointed out a

00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:01.480
[Amit Varma]: 3,000 children die every day in India, from starvation, one in four Indian children are

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:07.000
[Amit Varma]: malnourished. My point being that we notice these things, the homelessness, the deaths,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.320
[Amit Varma]: the hunger, when there is something like COVID-19 or something like a tsunami or something like

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:17.000
[Amit Varma]: a cyclone approximate event brings it into relief. But these have always been with us.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.560
[Amit Varma]: And I have some questions here. And one of my questions is that, could we then say that,

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:27.720
[Amit Varma]: by and large, the apathy that most people display towards this is a natural defense

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.800
[Amit Varma]: mechanism? Because most of us will think that, hey, I can't do something about such a big

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.640
[Amit Varma]: problem, or I don't want to, or hey, screw it, I need to get on with my own life. And

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.680
[Amit Varma]: therefore, this becomes a defense mechanism. And another added narrative element to the

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.600
[Amit Varma]: defense mechanism is we rant against the state. We say the state should be doing all of this.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Why isn't the state doing anything? And that kind of becomes an approach that keeps us

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.360
[Amit Varma]: trapped in apathy. Like even now, I see many people like yourself and your colleagues like

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:02.920
[Amit Varma]: Ruben Mascarenhas and so on, who are out there every day, obsessed with helping others. And

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:09.000
[Amit Varma]: I see a lot of people just outraging on social media, but not actually doing anything themselves.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.160
[Amit Varma]: And I don't want this just to be a rant. But I just wonder, like, for example, there's

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.880
[Amit Varma]: almost an ecosystem of relief that has happened, partly including people who were doing things

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:23.160
[Amit Varma]: to help society before, partly including a lot of people who weren't, who now suddenly

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.800
[Amit Varma]: see the pain around them, feel the loss, and they say, hey, I want to help, I want to donate,

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.880
[Amit Varma]: I want to organize something, I want to do this. How much of that will remain after this

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:35.720
[Amit Varma]: pandemic? What is it that, you know, needs to be done for people to realize that shit,

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:41.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, this has caused a lot of pain, but we live with a lot of pain on a daily basis.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:45.920
[Amit Varma]: 3000 people dying every day of starvation is, you know, how is it not comparable with

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.480
[Amit Varma]: the people who are dying of COVID? That's a solvable problem. You know, and you can't

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:54.040
[Amit Varma]: just take the cop out and say that, hey, the, you know, the state has failed us, which is

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.680
[Amit Varma]: fine. But, you know, like in my last episode with Karthik, for example, we had that discussion

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:03.240
[Amit Varma]: on, you know, my growing feeling that we cannot depend just on the state, I'm okay that we

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:07.740
[Amit Varma]: should try to work with the state, we should be stakeholders. But a lot of these solutions

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:12.040
[Amit Varma]: have to come from private people just going out there and saying that there are problems,

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.640
[Amit Varma]: I want to solve them, whether you're doing it in a non-profit way, or whether some of

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.760
[Amit Varma]: these problems, you say that I will build a business out of it, but there are problems

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.020
[Amit Varma]: that need to be solved. What is your sort of thinking on all of this? And is it something

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:29.840
[Amit Varma]: that has evolved or gained detail over the last few months?

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.440
[Guest]: It is a defense mechanism, but it's not a natural defense mechanism. So I'd make that

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:42.640
[Guest]: distinction first. It's a, it's a cultivated defense mechanism. And really, to understand

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:47.880
[Guest]: it correctly, in my mind, at least, you have to ask yourself, what is the difference between

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:54.320
[Guest]: a community and a campus? If you answer that question, you will be able to figure out the

00:38:54.320 --> 00:39:01.880
[Guest]: rest of it easily. Every community is a campus, but not every campus is a community. Right?

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:07.120
[Guest]: People say my apartment community or in my whatever, office community. A lot of the things

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.560
[Guest]: that we call communities are only campuses. They're not really communities.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.040
[Guest]: Can you define campus for me in this context?

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:19.240
[Guest]: Something that has a wall and a gate and a way of living and using it within that space,

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:25.760
[Guest]: which is it could be even a BSNL housing society. It could be your apartment community or mine

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:31.240
[Guest]: or a corporate office block built by some, you know, construction company. It could be

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:36.760
[Guest]: any of these kinds of things. These are campuses. If you don't have a natural way of belonging

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:42.680
[Guest]: in that space, you can't be there. There are lots of ways of ensuring, in fact, that you

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:47.560
[Guest]: are not there. If you want to walk on 25 streets in Bombay, or if I want to walk on 50 streets

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:54.360
[Guest]: in Bangalore, I really don't need to ask anybody, right? I have a natural way of being there,

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:59.240
[Guest]: which is not challenged in any way. Right? That doesn't make those people my community.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:04.680
[Guest]: But I'm saying space is one part of understanding the difference between a campus and a community.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:10.320
[Guest]: I mean, think about a community in this way. Even in a closed community, somebody has to

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:15.040
[Guest]: live on the edge of the community. So let's say you have the plot at the edge of the community

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.600
[Guest]: or the apartment at the edge of the community. What you're really saying is that my neighbor

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.920
[Unknown]: on my left is my neighbor, and he's part of my community. My neighbor on my right is not

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:29.600
[Guest]: even part of my community. Imagine living on a street of houses, on a public street

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:36.160
[Guest]: of houses, and saying the guy on my right is not my neighbor. You would not do that.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:43.120
[Guest]: First of all, it's ridiculous. Second, it's a cultivated thing. It's that wall that's

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.880
[Guest]: making you think he's not your neighbor. You pay a certain maintenance fee every month,

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:53.640
[Guest]: he doesn't do that. You have certain services inside your community that you've organized

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.640
[Guest]: for yourself, he's not part of that. He might, in fact, be part of another set of such services

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.320
[Guest]: in his community. So it's not like you're excluding him, you're hoping that he's got

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:07.920
[Guest]: his own setup in some way. But I'm saying there is a cultivated difference.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.840
[Guest]: So I think earlier also we spoke about this. Everybody has got security guards. What are

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:19.960
[Guest]: these security guards doing? People are just standing at some standpost, really, and doing

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:25.040
[Guest]: some bizarre things, writing things on notebooks that nobody even looks at. In fact, I've tried

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:31.640
[Guest]: one exercise a lot. When I get this notification on some app that the community has to say,

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:38.240
[Guest]: oh, so-and-so has come to see you. Should we let them in? And I always say no. Right?

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:44.480
[Guest]: And they let them in anyway. It's a process. Somebody has to ask whether this person should

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:50.000
[Guest]: be let in. Somebody has to note down that there has to be a response. And after that,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.400
[Guest]: the person can be let in. Actually, if the response is no, what you should do is not

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.840
[Guest]: written down anywhere in most of these places. Maybe in the companies, it's a little different

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:02.880
[Guest]: because you're going into somebody's office to see. But you can try all these little experiments

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:08.240
[Guest]: that teach you that these are processes that exist for the sake of having a process. They

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:13.520
[Guest]: have the illusion of a community. They're actually nothing more than some silly campus

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:19.720
[Guest]: thing. Right? And Peter Block is the guy who really, in my mind, wrote about this in the

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:27.880
[Guest]: most impactful way. He wrote a book called Community. And the essence of that is that

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:34.960
[Guest]: communities work on trust. And they try to enable the gifts of each person in that community.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:40.280
[Guest]: Right? Amit Verma has a gift for communication. Whether he's a four-year-old child or a 45-year-old

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:47.880
[Guest]: man is not different. With this gift for communication, what can we do that really is powerful for

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:53.560
[Guest]: so many other people in this space, whether there's a wall or not a wall? And maybe, like,

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:59.360
[Guest]: what can you do even outside this space like you're doing? That's one way of thinking about

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:06.520
[Guest]: people. Another way of thinking about people is out of fear and distrust. That you believe

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:12.040
[Guest]: the person who is coming to visit your neighbor in your apartment community could potentially

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:17.880
[Guest]: come to your house and rob you, could potentially assault your teenage daughter. You start with

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:25.920
[Guest]: believing that. And therefore, you say, well, we need a system that protects us from that.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.280
[Guest]: People have lived on the street for the longest time without that system. Right? I mean, on

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.640
[Guest]: street side houses for the longest time without that system. The system does not come from

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:39.440
[Guest]: the security guard or the MyGate application. It actually comes from something else. It's

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:47.480
[Guest]: a cultivated way of thinking that fear and distrust are necessary parts of how you respond

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:52.960
[Guest]: to large, complex problems, which you think you cannot grapple with. You refer to people

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:58.520
[Guest]: saying I can't deal with this. But their response to I can't deal with this is sometimes to

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:03.800
[Guest]: say I need somebody to help me deal with this. And they choose the wrong guy. They really

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:08.000
[Guest]: should be going to people who teach them how to help build strong communities. They shouldn't

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.360
[Guest]: be going to people who teach them how to hire security guards. And frankly, those same security

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:18.240
[Guest]: guards can be used in very different ways. You teach them to work like an usher. You

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.000
[Guest]: teach them to work like a receiving agent for materials that need to be dispatched.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.840
[Guest]: There's a million things you can do that give them also more dignity than to just stand

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:31.920
[Guest]: around in the sun or in the rain and give them actually some competence that they can

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:36.520
[Guest]: take into another job if they want to, that frees them from the bondage into which they

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:41.160
[Guest]: have come into your large city from Jharkhand or Orissa or whatever kind of thing.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:47.960
[Guest]: I'm saying we have to think of different groups of people in the society in a way that enables

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:55.040
[Guest]: that, that gives to the guy standing at the gate, he has to be part of your community.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.800
[Guest]: How can you say that somebody who is a service provider to your community is not a member

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:05.760
[Guest]: of your community? I just don't accept that. But we have a cultivated way of coming to

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:11.240
[Guest]: this stuff, which is just mind-numbing. And I think it's happening in the schools, it's

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:17.160
[Guest]: happening in the companies, it's happening in the workplaces in a way that you have to

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.680
[Guest]: beat this socially.

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:24.400
[Guest]: I mean, during the previous campaigns, the India Against Corruption campaign or even

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:29.800
[Guest]: the election campaigns, I've observed this, but people would say, sir, you can't trust

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:36.920
[Guest]: anybody. But if you go and talk to his neighbor, he'll say the same thing. So Amit says he

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:42.120
[Guest]: can't trust his neighbor. Amit's neighbor says you can't trust Amit. And the funny part

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:46.880
[Guest]: is both Amit and his neighbor will say to me, you and I know each other, therefore we

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:51.000
[Guest]: can trust each other. You are trustworthy, I know, but my neighbor may not. And my neighbor

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.680
[Guest]: also says the same thing, Ashwin sir, you are trustworthy, you and I know each other,

00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:00.360
[Guest]: but therefore you cannot trust everybody. You know what I mean? I think we have to crack

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:07.200
[Guest]: this in a different way. I remember an old article I wrote about the importance of wanting

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:14.000
[Guest]: to do the right thing, even if you can't do it. You ask kids, what do you want to do when

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.400
[Guest]: you grow up? And every once in a while, there'll be a girl who says, I want to change the world.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:25.920
[Guest]: I think it's important to help young people in particular believe that they should want

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:32.360
[Guest]: to change the world for the better. They may not be able to, but I think it's extraordinarily

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:38.920
[Guest]: important to teach a child, you should change the world for the better. Because other people

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:42.360
[Guest]: before you have tried to change the world for the better, and you are a beneficiary

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:48.720
[Guest]: of that, number one. Second, this is what distinguishes you as a human from many other

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:54.400
[Guest]: species that you could have been members of. And it's a decent thing to do. There's a contractual

00:46:54.400 --> 00:47:00.200
[Guest]: social arrangement built into this thing. And most importantly, if you believe this,

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:04.920
[Guest]: you will spend your life in the company of people that you will respect, and people who

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:10.280
[Guest]: will inspire you. And I think, you know, that's really important. At some level, I mean, I'm

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.880
[Guest]: much older than I am when I started doing all this stuff. But at some level, I've always

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:20.360
[Guest]: said, I'm a child of the development experience in this country, right? I have a family, because

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:25.280
[Guest]: I'm a child of that development experience. And that family includes all sorts of people

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:29.960
[Guest]: in the development sector, it includes people like you, it includes people that you come

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:38.480
[Guest]: into contact with, whose collective intent represents some larger public good, which

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:45.840
[Guest]: I may not always be able to contour correctly. But that intent itself nourishes my life.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:52.120
[Guest]: And that intent really can shape a lot of young lives. And I really think that's important

00:47:52.120 --> 00:48:00.840
[Guest]: to be able to hold on to the idea that to live in an empathetic and decent way is something

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:08.360
[Guest]: we should expect of our neighbor, not be content with saying, well, Bhagwan jane, who can believe

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:14.080
[Guest]: him? Or who can trust him? Well, and also, I think people would trust each other a little

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:18.560
[Guest]: bit more if they just know each other. I don't know if I did this seven four letter words

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.520
[Guest]: thing with you the last time. I think I did that.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.520
[Guest]: You did.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.720
[Guest]: I always tell people go and meet new people, right? And they will say, it's not, it's not

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:30.200
[Guest]: easy to meet new people. What nonsense, go on the street, all kinds of people that you

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:34.960
[Guest]: don't know, just go up to them and say hello. And they think that's really odd. But actually,

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:39.360
[Guest]: if you did that for 10 days, it'll stop being odd. And then you'll start to think, why don't

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.640
[Guest]: I know all these people? They're around me all the time, this shopkeeper, this laundryman,

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.040
[Guest]: you know, you know, the laundryman who comes to your house, you don't know the laundryman

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:51.440
[Guest]: who comes to your neighbor's house. So there's all of these bizarre things that there's a

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:57.560
[Guest]: lot of neighborliness without neighborhood. There's a lot of campus without community.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.640
[Guest]: There's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of that. It's that small nuance. And it makes

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:06.040
[Guest]: all the difference. And even about relief, I've been saying, relief is not a logistics

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:11.440
[Guest]: problem. Aid is not a logistics issue. You must get in the aid thing because you believe

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:19.600
[Guest]: in the fundamental dignity of other people to live in a way that with at least a minimum

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:25.400
[Guest]: standard of protection for their lives and livelihoods, and to be able to count on each

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:31.360
[Guest]: other in times like this. That's why you go and do aid, not because it's technomanagerially

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:36.640
[Guest]: needed on the day the pandemic or the cyclone or the tsunamis hits you. Incidentally, about

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.920
[Guest]: the tsunami, one of the very first things I did with Mapunity was mapping out tsunami

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:47.520
[Guest]: relief stuff. So I remember that, you know, starting point quite well.

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:51.720
[Amit Varma]: So a lot of strands to pick up from and first of all, for my listeners, you mentioned all

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:56.000
[Amit Varma]: those four letter words, I recommend all the listeners to check out episode 160 of the

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.840
[Amit Varma]: scene and the unseen, which was where Ashwin first appeared and it remains a favorite episode

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:04.040
[Amit Varma]: for many people. And the first half of that was not so much about his work, but his philosophy

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:08.200
[Amit Varma]: towards life. And there's a lot that I found very inspiring there. So do check that out.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.200
[Amit Varma]: I'll link it from the show notes.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.520
[Guest]: I want to go back to what Karthik said in the last episode. You asked me about that.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:18.760
[Guest]: I don't remember the exact question that you asked, but I felt like for part of that conversation,

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:24.000
[Guest]: you were continuing a debate that we had in my second episode with you, which was, you

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.040
[Guest]: know, some people even wrote to me about it and said, I noticed it was quite, you know,

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:34.120
[Guest]: back and forth at the end. It was really a contrast between two ways of thinking. And

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.480
[Guest]: this whole state, you are the state kind of thing.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:41.520
[Amit Varma]: Let's come to that. I want to respond to what you just said. So before we lose the thread,

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.880
[Amit Varma]: and then I'll come back to that question. You know, I agree with the conclusion that

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:51.480
[Amit Varma]: you came to, which is that we need to beat this socially, this problem of apathy. And

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:57.240
[Amit Varma]: I also kind of agree with a lot of your diagnosis, but not with some of the terms. For example,

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:03.160
[Amit Varma]: you spoke about how this kind of apathy is cultivated. And I would actually say that

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:08.120
[Amit Varma]: it's the opposite, that this apathy is evolved and the way that we beat it, that is what

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:12.360
[Amit Varma]: we have to cultivate. For example, you know, evolutionary psychologists will often talk

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:17.440
[Amit Varma]: about how there is a circle of 150 people that we can really remember by face, we can't

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:23.040
[Amit Varma]: remember more people than that by face. So we divide the world into this is our tribe,

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:28.160
[Amit Varma]: and everything else is the other in the sense that our brains evolved in prehistoric times.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.960
[Amit Varma]: That is how we are wired to think we are of course wired to think in contradictory ways,

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:37.120
[Amit Varma]: but this is a core way. Now, a concept that I found that influenced me profoundly came

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:42.400
[Amit Varma]: from a book written in I think 1900. It's about the history of morals by W.E.H. Leckie,

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:47.680
[Amit Varma]: where he talks about something called the expanding circle. And his point there is that

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:52.040
[Amit Varma]: he doesn't pick up on this 150 people concept, but he says that look, who are the people

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:56.640
[Amit Varma]: we consider worthy of a moral consideration? Initially, it is a very small circle, maybe

00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:01.040
[Amit Varma]: it's just a family, then it expands to our tribe. And initially, it's very few people

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:04.960
[Amit Varma]: because our brains have evolved in times of scarcity, you know, daily survival is almost

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:10.240
[Amit Varma]: like a zero sum fight with others. But gradually as society evolves, and it's no longer zero

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:15.600
[Amit Varma]: sum from your family, your circle will expand to maybe your tribe, then maybe your neighborhood,

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.480
[Amit Varma]: it will become a country, it will become your people, your race, your species. And Leckie's

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:24.920
[Amit Varma]: point was that through history, we found that circle moving to a point that, you know, for

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:29.600
[Amit Varma]: many people, it includes all human beings. And Peter Singer, I think, wrote a book called

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:34.240
[Amit Varma]: The Utilitarian Philosopher, who was also an animal rights activist, wrote a book called

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.560
[Amit Varma]: The Expanding Circle, in fact, I think where his argument was that one day the circle will

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:43.840
[Amit Varma]: expand enough to include animals in it, which is actually a powerful argument. I don't see

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:48.240
[Amit Varma]: why not. And we could easily, you know, three centuries later, be judging all the people

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:53.080
[Amit Varma]: who live today, saying that, Oh, my God, what savages they ate meat in the same way that,

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.600
[Amit Varma]: you know, people today will judge people two centuries ago and say, Oh, my God, they had

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:01.360
[Amit Varma]: slaves, women couldn't vote. So a circle is expanding. And this is a good thing. But my

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:07.400
[Amit Varma]: argument would be that what is natural to us, what has evolved is this sense of dividing

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:13.880
[Amit Varma]: the world into us versus the other. And what has been cultivated, perhaps since the Enlightenment

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:19.360
[Amit Varma]: in an organized way, is this sense that no, the circle is expanding, it involves all of

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:25.720
[Amit Varma]: us. And in a sense, we are fighting this sort of tribalistic hardwiring. And one modern

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:32.320
[Amit Varma]: problem that we face is that a lot of our politics is going straight into that old hardwiring

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:36.640
[Amit Varma]: that we are trying to fight, where a lot of our politics is thinking in tribalistic term

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:41.680
[Amit Varma]: is painting others, like the German political theorist, Carl Schmitt spoke about how to

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:46.400
[Amit Varma]: be successful in politics, you need to have an enemy, or you need to construct an enemy,

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:52.000
[Amit Varma]: there is no politics without an enemy. And this seems to feed again, to that tribal instinct.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.480
[Amit Varma]: And even within this pandemic, instead of, you know, all of us are united by our suffering

00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:01.120
[Amit Varma]: by what we are going through. And yet, you still see the same political tropes happen

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:05.640
[Amit Varma]: where one side will take, you know, one narrative line, another side will take another narrative

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:11.360
[Amit Varma]: line. But my point is the same as yours, that we need to continue the cultivation of the

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:16.520
[Amit Varma]: expansion of that circle, that expanding circle, we needed to expand. And that, to me, is a

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:21.880
[Amit Varma]: social battle, more than anything else. So one, do you have any thoughts to add to this?

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:26.640
[Amit Varma]: And two, we can then move on to the question I asked about the state versus, you know,

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.800
[Amit Varma]: that we need to not do the cop out of saying the state will do it, or we need to work with

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:36.400
[Amit Varma]: the state, but actually say that, look, we got to get down and dirty much as you are,

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:42.960
[Guest]: and we need to solve these problems ourselves. Yeah, I mean, I mean, there's a temporal element

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:48.560
[Guest]: to it. I promised myself I wouldn't talk like Karthik. So let me tell you what I mean. I

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:54.440
[Guest]: can't also. I mean, the guy is great. He can use words with such precise meanings at breakneck

00:54:54.440 --> 00:55:00.640
[Guest]: speed without making even a mistake in how he delivers it. I can't even believe that.

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:11.000
[Guest]: But to come back to it, what do I mean is, this expanding circle thing is not a sequence.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.640
[Guest]: That's all it is. I care about my children because they are my children. But it is possible

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:22.120
[Guest]: at the same time to care about children because they are children too, right? They're just

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:27.040
[Guest]: not my children, right? In fact, you know, if you didn't know in the universe of children

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:33.480
[Guest]: which child was yours, you would actually have a very different way of treating children,

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:37.640
[Guest]: right? There is an element, I think what you're saying and all these philosophers have been

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:41.320
[Guest]: saying is that knowing who is your child, who is your brother, who is your neighbor

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:49.280
[Guest]: itself has a certain boundary in how you behave. And then you start to say, therefore, I behave

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:53.600
[Guest]: in a certain way inside this boundary, in a certain way outside that boundary. And maybe

00:55:53.600 --> 00:56:00.200
[Guest]: this campus is just a reflection of that. But I actually think the way to beat that

00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:04.360
[Guest]: is not to say, let's all build 10 campuses or 10 boundaries, and then we'll figure out

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:10.160
[Guest]: how to transact and interact across boundaries. You could do that. But I think it's not that

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:18.920
[Guest]: necessary to tell you the truth. You could say, because I care about my children anyway,

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:24.960
[Guest]: there's no reason not to care about other children also now. Even if you thought about

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:29.520
[Guest]: a sequence, you already care about your children. So what does sequence mean at that point?

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:35.360
[Guest]: So you ought to be caring about all children now. So you may not be able to do all things

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:41.880
[Guest]: for all children, or like you would for your own. But I think there is a reasonable way

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:48.960
[Guest]: of saying, even if I have these boundaries, these boundaries reflect capacity. If there

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:54.360
[Guest]: is a boundary, it's the boundary of my capacity. It's not the boundary of my empathy. It's

00:56:54.360 --> 00:57:01.840
[Guest]: not the boundary of my preferred intent for why I live the way I do. I think it is possible

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:06.040
[Guest]: for people to say that. And they will still have the boundaries that come from capacity.

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:12.960
[Guest]: You can't do everything. That's life. In fact, that's just reality. But also, I think there's

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:19.240
[Guest]: a way to think of this, which is just that little bit. It's like watching the tail of

00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:23.800
[Guest]: a tiger when you're walking in a forest behind a tree. You see the tail of the tiger and

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:27.440
[Guest]: you ask yourself, what should I think now? That the rest of the tiger is attached to

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:33.280
[Guest]: it or that this is some discarded tail from an old tiger carcass? You can think all sorts

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.760
[Guest]: of things. Francis Crick wrote a book about all this stuff. It's called The Astonishing

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:43.240
[Guest]: Hypothesis. We should talk about that someday. But I think there's a lot that we don't see.

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:47.200
[Guest]: And that's really the point. We believe what we see actually can mean lots of things. We

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:51.080
[Guest]: believe what the brain is telling us about what we see. We believe it only when we see

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:55.800
[Guest]: it. But we believe it when we hear it from other people. Hearing it is actually a kind

00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:00.320
[Guest]: of seeing it if you hear it from trusted sources. So there's lots of these kinds of nuances.

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:06.880
[Guest]: I think it's possible to treat this boundary that you're referring to, the circle, wherever

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:11.160
[Guest]: you draw that circle. If that circle is a circle of capacity rather than a circle of

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.840
[Guest]: intent, there's nothing wrong with it. But if it's a circle of intent, then there's a

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:19.120
[Amit Varma]: problem. Fair enough. Moving on now to Karthik's questions,

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:23.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, or what I discussed with him, where I don't want to take the stand that the state

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:26.600
[Amit Varma]: has no role to play. I mean, of course it does. We know what it should do. This is and

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:30.360
[Amit Varma]: has failed in many of them. And we should work with the state to make it work. But the

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:35.400
[Amit Varma]: sense increasingly grows upon me that at some point, we can't just say that the solution

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:39.200
[Amit Varma]: lies to the state, you know, we have to step up, we have to try to solve these problems

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:43.120
[Guest]: ourselves. Yes, I mean, and it goes to this idea of

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:49.160
[Guest]: you are the state that, you know, I had chats with you about, and Karthik sort of, I think

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:56.600
[Guest]: he's starting to lean that way a little bit as well. But I think I don't mean to dismiss

00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:00.560
[Guest]: what you said earlier, which is, hey, I've done my part of what I should be doing. I'm

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:05.320
[Guest]: not indifferent. I certainly have cared about lots of people. I've done what I could in

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:10.560
[Guest]: my spheres of influence. I've even paid my taxes on top of that, right? So the state,

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:15.960
[Guest]: I have a reasonable right to expect the state should do its job. And I think it's fair.

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:20.600
[Guest]: I think the state should do its job. I believe the state should do its job. It does have

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:25.200
[Guest]: a capacity problem in addition to everything else that is true. And then actually, if I

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:31.160
[Guest]: help the state do its job, it would be easier for me to demand that it does its job. Today,

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:37.320
[Guest]: there's a lot of people who don't help the state do its job. That's one of the reasons

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:42.120
[Guest]: why they're not able to demand that the state should do the job. That's what I mean. That

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:49.000
[Guest]: is the sociopolitical element. What I mean, I'll give you a transactional example, right?

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.000
[Guest]: What I mean by a transactional example is what you are aware of some problem. There

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.240
[Guest]: is an engineer or a public health official or somebody in the state who should do something

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:09.720
[Guest]: about it. One very small part of moving that line is to draw the attention of that person

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:14.760
[Guest]: to something that has happened. If a water main breaks on your street, yeah, you could

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:19.000
[Guest]: say the state should be putting detection technologies and IOTS platforms everywhere

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.200
[Guest]: to figure out if the water main is breaking and having a dashboard from which they can

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:29.960
[Guest]: tell that. That's true. But even before these things became possible, somehow somebody in

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.200
[Guest]: the state needs to know that this water main is broken. If it's not, you can't put IOTS

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:41.560
[Guest]: machines on everything. There is an element of knowing, and the element of knowing that

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:48.280
[Guest]: is possible from the population itself at large can never be mimicked by the state.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:53.240
[Guest]: It just cannot. There are just too many things that can go wrong that nobody can actually

01:00:53.240 --> 01:01:02.400
[Guest]: mimic. No state can mimic that. The velocity of the state's response depends on the state

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:08.760
[Guest]: getting to know these things. Also, among other things, right? If you know the state,

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:17.080
[Guest]: you can solve that part of the puzzle. I know my local BESCOM engineer, my BWSSB water manager,

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:21.400
[Guest]: some five, six guys like that, right? If I see something wrong, even if it's not actually

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.240
[Guest]: in my house, I'm driving down the street, I'm walking down the street, I see something

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:29.160
[Guest]: wrong, I could call the guy up and say, do something about it. You could say he might

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.880
[Guest]: do something about it because I'm calling him. But you could also say he's doing something

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.200
[Guest]: about it because that's the first time he's hearing about it. He's operating in a world

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:42.160
[Guest]: that he doesn't really have knowledge of. So I think there are elements of what you

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.840
[Guest]: are seeing which are certainly true. But there are also elements of what I'm saying that

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.760
[Guest]: are necessary. That is, after I have told him that there is something wrong, that he

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.840
[Guest]: should do something about it, I'm actually in a much better position to say, I told you.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:01.800
[Guest]: Why the hell didn't you do something about it? Whereas the guys who are completely outside

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:06.480
[Guest]: the system, it is true that they don't bring it to the attention of the system, but they

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.080
[Guest]: also don't have the ability, the capacity to ask that second question.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:16.480
[Guest]: So I think if our expectation is that the state should deliver on the things that we

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:23.680
[Guest]: expect from it, I think that expectation is actually benefited by my assisting the state.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:33.480
[Guest]: It's not substituted by my assisting the state. And it's a debatable point. I'm sure you can

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:38.000
[Guest]: think of seven examples of that. But I'm saying there is an element of that.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.520
[Amit Varma]: So we've debated this in our previous episodes. So I'll just direct the listeners to that.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:47.500
[Amit Varma]: I won't go back to that. But a quick kind of example comes to mind, sort of illustrating

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.400
[Amit Varma]: what this means. I mean, first of all, my fundamental point is that, look, the whole

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.380
[Amit Varma]: point of the state being there is that there are certain things I should be able to rely

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:58.560
[Amit Varma]: on it to do. That's why I pay my taxes. That I don't want to have to go and do the rule

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.640
[Amit Varma]: of law myself. I don't have to go and do the drainage myself.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:05.840
[Amit Varma]: I buy your point that if my drainage is overflowing outside my house, I have to first bring it

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:10.680
[Amit Varma]: to their attention as a citizen. You know, that I have to do. But if they are not fixing

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:16.000
[Amit Varma]: it for many days and people are falling ill, then at some point I have to say that, okay,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.120
[Amit Varma]: me and my immediate neighbors need to sort this out because it's affecting us.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.520
[Amit Varma]: The other kind of thought that strikes me is, let's do a thought experiment. Let's say

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:29.840
[Amit Varma]: that from where I am sitting, I can look outside and I can see that someone is beating a little

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.600
[Amit Varma]: girl on the road. Now, the first informational thing about, I mean, the state can't be everywhere.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.560
[Amit Varma]: So one thing I could do is let the state know, call a cop and immediately tell him. That's

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:44.080
[Amit Varma]: obviously not all. What I should do is I should go out there myself and I should stop that

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.660
[Amit Varma]: immediate beating happening. The other question that then comes up is what if the person doing

01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:52.240
[Amit Varma]: the beating is the state? What if it is the policeman who's beating a little girl, which

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.760
[Amit Varma]: is kind of a separate problem, but a relevant one in terms of COVID as well, because in

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.680
[Amit Varma]: terms of misinformation and a lot of the things that the state has done in terms of getting

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:05.780
[Amit Varma]: in the way of private enterprise, it's not just sins of omission, there are sins of commission

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:09.680
[Amit Varma]: as well. And you know, I've done an episode with Jason Brennan, the philosopher on that

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.520
[Amit Varma]: about that if the state does something wrong, does it have some extra leeway or is it is

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.200
[Amit Varma]: wrong wrong. And I agree with him that wrong is wrong, regardless of who does it. But that's

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.180
[Amit Varma]: a separate issue. I just think that there are certain moments where individuals have

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:27.500
[Amit Varma]: to come in and we'll drill a little bit deeper in that in the context of COVID because I'm

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:32.220
[Amit Varma]: certain that, you know, a lot of the things that are wrong with healthcare today are wrong

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.420
[Amit Varma]: with the kind of lives which people live in the context of how healthy they are and how

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:41.380
[Amit Varma]: they take care of it. A lot of it simply cannot be solved by the state because capacity issues

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:45.860
[Amit Varma]: to begin with, let's leave the other structural issues out of the way. Let's let's move on

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:50.220
[Amit Varma]: to the immediate now to the main subject of this episode. And I think a simple way to

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:55.940
[Amit Varma]: sort of dive into it rather than just talk at the level of ideas is a chronological sense.

01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:00.340
[Amit Varma]: Like I did an episode with your colleague Ruben Mascarenas, who did such amazing work

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:04.380
[Amit Varma]: last year during the lockdown when the migrant labor crisis happened and he and his group

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:09.060
[Amit Varma]: Khana Chahiye, you know, went around and fed so many people and Ruben in his individual

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:13.900
[Amit Varma]: capacity in the second wave has been helping people with beds and medicines and all of

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:19.180
[Amit Varma]: that and Khana Chahiye have also started an oxygen ambulance thing, all of which is incredible.

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:22.740
[Amit Varma]: And I know that you're involved at a socio political level in getting things done at

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:26.300
[Amit Varma]: the level of a city. We've discussed that in detail in the last two episodes. But in

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:31.020
[Amit Varma]: terms of immediate COVID relief, I think the easiest way to dive in is through the chronology

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:37.700
[Amit Varma]: where tell me a little bit about how your kind of thinking about this began, what are

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:41.540
[Amit Varma]: the moments where you began to say, no, I got to do something here. I got to do something

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:45.740
[Amit Varma]: here and here and here. And how does your vision deepen? Therefore, equally at the same

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:49.700
[Amit Varma]: time, how does your spheres of activity widen?

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:57.700
[Guest]: So it doesn't begin like that. That's I mean, if you take the Khana Chahiye example itself.

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:06.060
[Guest]: Yes, Neerajan, Ruben and all those guys did extraordinary stuff on the ground. But what

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:11.140
[Guest]: happens is when you start to do that kind of stuff, you say, we need to raise more money,

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:16.660
[Guest]: for example, or we can't really see this properly. We're not able to present it to the municipal

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:20.820
[Guest]: corporation in a way that convinces them that they should be looking at it in a different

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:26.180
[Guest]: way. So typically, what will happen, you're trying to solve that problem. Someone will

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:30.140
[Guest]: call you and say, can you help a little bit round up some more money to feed people? Can

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:34.820
[Guest]: you can map unity help map all these things so that we can actually look at it on a spatial

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:38.620
[Guest]: platform? Do you have a tool that will help us gather this information? Because you have

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:42.260
[Guest]: volunteers on the ground doing 27 different things. They're all related activity, but

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:48.340
[Guest]: you don't have a way to gather them. So what happens is that your first involvement with

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:57.700
[Guest]: any problem is techno managing it. But it is happening in a world that is already sociopolitical.

01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:02.580
[Guest]: The Ruben Maskar and associates of the world are already my friends, already my allies,

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:08.380
[Guest]: already my whatever, family, extended family in some way. So it's you're only asking questions

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:13.900
[Guest]: within that family. So for you, if the question doesn't come to you as something that creates

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:18.300
[Guest]: a tipping point, it comes to you as something that creates capacity. First, right, we can

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:22.620
[Guest]: do more of this, if all of us pull together. And this is the same thing. Even if you look

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:28.260
[Guest]: at COVID, right, the first set of things don't come to you as in this way of deciding that

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:34.580
[Guest]: we must do something. You never actually make that decision. You come to that point because

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:40.500
[Guest]: you are transactionally, and what I mean by that is at an activity level, involved in

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:45.820
[Guest]: the bits and pieces of that response, right? Whether I'm inside the state or outside the

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:50.980
[Guest]: state, whether through technology or not, in all sorts of ways, right? Somebody needs

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:56.860
[Guest]: to get something delivered in Chitradurga, right? So people say, you know what, let me

01:07:56.860 --> 01:08:01.580
[Guest]: ask Ashwin, he's bound to know somebody in Chitradurga. So I'm asking somebody in Chitradurga,

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:04.820
[Guest]: there's some medicine that needs to reach some family, there's some difficulty in getting

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:09.700
[Guest]: this delivered. You know Chitradurga well, help this guy get this delivered. So it's

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:15.860
[Guest]: transactional, it's activity at that level. But in the process of doing that, you are

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:23.140
[Guest]: now in the medical relief supply chain in some way, right? And then you recognize patterns

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.900
[Guest]: in it. You say, oh, I did this in Chitradurga yesterday, I'm doing this in Anekal today,

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:31.460
[Guest]: I'm doing this in Karwar tomorrow. And then you start to tell yourself, this is not going

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:37.460
[Guest]: to scale if we do it like this. We need somebody in the system who can take all these requests,

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:41.940
[Guest]: contact all the people that we know in all of these different geographies, and build

01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:48.940
[Guest]: velocity to be able to respond to these things better. And if there's one thing that distinguishes

01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:54.780
[Guest]: how we have set about doing relief work in this particular ecosystem, and this is not

01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:59.980
[Guest]: just a development family ecosystem, I'm going to say that too. In this approach, you can

01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:04.340
[Guest]: round up participation from all sorts of people in all those buckets that I listed earlier,

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:08.820
[Guest]: the corporate guys, the executives, even the CSR guys, and even the industrialists and

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:14.220
[Guest]: the big donors. You can round up all this. But the thing that rounds them up is this

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:19.340
[Guest]: notion of expanding capacity, right? That it can be done, I can do it, I know other

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:23.820
[Guest]: people that can do it. Therefore, if you have additional capacity, it's natural that other

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:30.900
[Guest]: people come to it. And I feel building it in this way has been useful, because it has

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:35.980
[Guest]: left a large number of people with the impression that you can actually do this differently.

01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:39.740
[Guest]: I said this a couple of days ago on social media, and a lot of people sort of wrote back

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:46.260
[Guest]: on that. Every state has a government-to-people response to the pandemic. The government is

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:49.740
[Guest]: doing something. You may not always agree with what they're doing, or you may not always

01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:53.740
[Guest]: think it's enough, but they're doing something. No government is doing nothing. I mean, no

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:59.260
[Guest]: government is doing even a half-baked job, if you ask me. They're doing something. The

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:05.860
[Guest]: state governments, I make a distinction between government at various levels. And then in

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:13.860
[Guest]: many places, there is also businesses and large people with the capacity to help doing

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:16.940
[Guest]: something because the governments have reached out to them, or they themselves had those

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.660
[Guest]: connections anyway, and they're helping in some way.

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:25.780
[Guest]: I think what we've set out to try in Karnataka is distinguished by two other things. We're

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:30.940
[Guest]: doing a people-to-state program. We're saying, we're going to round up people to help the

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:36.460
[Guest]: government. That's one part. It's not a philosophical thing. It's not a position thing. It's just

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:41.140
[Guest]: basically that's what we're going to add this piece. The people are going to help the government.

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:45.860
[Guest]: That's number one. And the fourth piece is the people are going to help each other. Not

01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:51.100
[Guest]: in this neighborly scale of, I can do it in my neighborhood kind of thing. I, living in

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:55.660
[Guest]: the southeastern corner of the state, accept responsibility for every last person living

01:10:55.660 --> 01:11:02.700
[Guest]: within the state's boundary in Karwar. And therefore, this people-people thing, it has

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:09.460
[Guest]: great potential because now you're saying, let us all of us together in this state, build

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:15.700
[Guest]: these two additional capacities, the people-to-government capacity and the people-to-people capacity.

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:20.340
[Guest]: And I genuinely believe that the velocity of the response depends on these two things

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:26.340
[Guest]: for a very simple reason. There are lots of people. The Sarkar has few people. Businesses

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:31.460
[Guest]: have even fewer people. Communities don't even have what most businesses do. But the

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:37.900
[Guest]: general population, you can never out-compete the general population for sheer numbers.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:42.060
[Guest]: So the question is, can you tap into the general population? Can you build a response strategy

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:48.540
[Guest]: that taps for sheer volume into that general population? If you build that strategy, it's

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:53.700
[Guest]: effectively, then you're at war with the virus. Everybody's involved. It's like a war at that

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:58.340
[Guest]: point. The virus is everywhere. You have to be everywhere too.

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:02.180
[Amit Varma]: So that's fascinating that there are different sort of questions that come to mind based

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:06.420
[Amit Varma]: on this. And I'll quickly outline them and then you can kind of go through them one by

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:10.500
[Amit Varma]: one. Like one aspect of this, of course, is that you're saying there's a proximate problem,

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:14.460
[Amit Varma]: right? Somewhere people can't get food, they're getting food. Somewhere somebody is not getting

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:20.660
[Amit Varma]: some medicine, you can help them get medicine. Now, initially, you obviously begin by solving

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:24.820
[Amit Varma]: the proximate problems in a piecemeal way that you call up your friend in Chitradurga

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:27.940
[Amit Varma]: and you say, hey, can you get medicine to this guy? Then you realize, no, let's scale

01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:32.620
[Amit Varma]: it. Let's build a system of response that is scalable. So now what you're doing is you're

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:38.260
[Amit Varma]: scaling a system of responding to these proximate problems. Now, the other thought that comes

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:43.420
[Amit Varma]: up here is that these are proximate problems that are really symptoms of a deeper problem.

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:48.100
[Amit Varma]: Like if there are scarcities of medicines, or if there was a scarcity of oxygen, for

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:52.220
[Amit Varma]: example, in so many places in the country, why is that there? What is the problem with

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:57.140
[Amit Varma]: migrant labor that they suffer such incredible shocks in terms of not even being able to

01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:00.940
[Amit Varma]: feed themselves when something goes wrong. And there are deeper structural problems with

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:04.860
[Amit Varma]: that. And part of the question is identifying those problems and saying, hey, in the long

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:09.660
[Amit Varma]: term, we got to solve those problems. And my intermediate question sort of is that while

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:13.700
[Amit Varma]: scaling up your response to the proximate problems, and I'll ask you to kind of go into

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:16.860
[Amit Varma]: the concrete details of that, because I find that really fascinating. But while saying

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:21.980
[Amit Varma]: that TK, we want to now scale it up so that we can get oxygen to wherever it's required,

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:27.620
[Amit Varma]: we can get food to wherever is required, you scale that up. But how much of that infrastructure

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:32.020
[Amit Varma]: or that ecosystem that you've built to tackle these proximate problems is something that

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:37.900
[Amit Varma]: then is relevant for the future? Like, are we always going to fight symptoms? Or are

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:43.940
[Amit Varma]: these things that we've set up also useful in fighting the sort of bigger problems? And

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:48.940
[Amit Varma]: I've kind of stated my whole set of questions here. But I'm happy if you kind of take them

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:52.900
[Amit Varma]: one by one, like, first of all, do you agree with the characterizations that there are

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:56.220
[Amit Varma]: these proximate problems, and then there are bigger structural issues that are with us

01:13:56.220 --> 01:14:01.060
[Amit Varma]: forever. And the proximate problem tomorrow in the next crisis might be some other different

01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:05.660
[Amit Varma]: detail, but the structural issues are the same. And moving on from that, maybe we can

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:09.540
[Amit Varma]: talk about how you set about scaling the response, as you said.

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:15.380
[Guest]: So I'll start with this last question, because frankly, it answers most of the others leading

01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:19.780
[Guest]: up to you're essentially leading up to a question. And if I answer that question, the rest of

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:26.380
[Guest]: the question, the stuff is built into the answer. One is that the very act of involving

01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:35.500
[Guest]: lots more people in a transactional response also gives you the potential to call upon

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:43.420
[Guest]: a much larger ecosystem for more things in the future. Because I know people in Chitradurga,

01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:49.180
[Guest]: as a result of doing what we are doing now, I can do something in Chitradurga all the

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:56.020
[Guest]: time in the future. Not always at this intensity, not always at this scale. And it's not just

01:14:56.020 --> 01:15:00.500
[Guest]: me, right? It's hundreds of people, thousands of people now know each other in multiple

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:05.020
[Guest]: geographies. And sometimes it's multiple geographies, even in their own cities, in large cities,

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.660
[Guest]: that's also important, right?

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:13.820
[Guest]: So the very act of constructing the response in this way builds one part of the social

01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:19.300
[Guest]: capacity for responding to further things. The things that they respond to in the future

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:24.620
[Guest]: need not be pandemics and catastrophes, it could be ongoing baseline problems. So that's

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:30.580
[Guest]: one part of it, that 10 people who know each other, because they came together in this

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:35.340
[Guest]: way, now have the capacity to do slightly more, because they know slightly more. So

01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:39.700
[Guest]: I'll give you this example. Let's say I do something with UrbanClap. And we'd set up

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:46.740
[Guest]: some kind of infrastructure mechanics training program or service system for public hospitals

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:52.600
[Guest]: as a result of that. The reality is that the result of having had that connection and that

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:59.060
[Guest]: experience is that tomorrow you can say, look, what are the potential of this for some other

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:02.340
[Guest]: problem that you want to take on? So that, I think, is one part of it.

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:09.420
[Guest]: The second part of it is, I think, velocity, right? I make a distinction between velocity

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:14.060
[Guest]: and speed. A lot of things can be done with speed. And governments sometimes have been

01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:18.420
[Guest]: doing lots of things in the wrong direction. And therefore, all the speed in the world

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.500
[Guest]: is not going to help governments that do those things in the wrong direction, right? So velocity

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:28.220
[Guest]: is important. And velocity is better informed by visibility to the outcome. And that visibility

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:33.900
[Guest]: to the outcome really depends on having multiple eyes and ears in multiple geographies. So

01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:39.940
[Guest]: I think that's also a lasting thing. But the third thing is also important. The

01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:43.340
[Guest]: question that you're asking is nonetheless important. If you take all of the things that

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:49.740
[Guest]: you want to do and do it only in this transactional way, yes, there is some ongoing social value

01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:54.900
[Guest]: because of the connections that evolve, but it's not very great. Which is why in my conversations

01:16:54.900 --> 01:17:00.140
[Guest]: in particular with the donor community, the thing that I have been saying is, let's break

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:04.220
[Guest]: this down into all the things that need to be done. And I'll send you that list. I don't

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:08.380
[Guest]: even mind if you put that on your show notes or something. Here are the seven or eight

01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:13.020
[Guest]: things that need to be done. This is what needs to be done in terms of in-hospital infrastructure.

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:17.300
[Guest]: This is what needs to be done in terms of long-term care, post-care COVID. This is what

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:20.460
[Guest]: needs to be done in terms of testing. This is what needs to be done in terms of genome

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:25.220
[Guest]: sequencing. This is what needs to be done in terms of ensuring continuing oxygen supply.

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:29.860
[Guest]: This is what needs to be done in terms of ensuring production of oxygen synthesizing

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:34.220
[Guest]: machines in India. This is what needs to be done to get the vaccine production things.

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:42.100
[Guest]: So if you can direct the donor money in particular to things that create greater internal capacity,

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:47.220
[Guest]: it's actually, it's a kind of make in India, if you think about it. And I think that's

01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:51.900
[Guest]: important. Actually, make in India has always been important. It's just that the Sarkari

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:57.820
[Guest]: definition of make in India has no place for sell in India. In fact, if you allow people

01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.340
[Guest]: to sell in India, they would make in India. That's pretty obvious. Anything that you allow

01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:04.260
[Guest]: to sell in India, people will eventually make in India. There are 1 billion people here

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:07.740
[Guest]: who can buy, who wouldn't want to make it if they were allowed to sell it. It's because

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:11.900
[Guest]: you don't allow them to sell it, so they don't make it here. So in some way, if you get this

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:16.780
[Guest]: capacity for consumption going, you can actually correct a lot of other problems.

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:22.220
[Guest]: So that's a lasting outcome that the money in particular can enable. And even the relationships

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:27.740
[Guest]: with governments at different levels are things that you can take forward. So I think if you

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:34.740
[Guest]: construct the response in a way that is people-to-people, people-to-government, then what happens, and

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:41.660
[Guest]: I would even go so far as to say that some of the donor money is aligning to this approach

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:46.820
[Guest]: precisely because it now sees this as having potential lasting value, not proven lasting

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:52.620
[Guest]: value. I'd be the first to concede that. But certainly, if you do this through this channel

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:58.260
[Guest]: in certain neighborhoods with local awareness, there's a much greater sense that these things

01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:02.460
[Guest]: are being used properly, and the guy's writing checks, not just the big donors, the guy's

01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:07.380
[Guest]: writing even CSR checks, want to be assured that their money is being used well. Who can

01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:11.940
[Guest]: provide that assurance better than a consumer of the actual thing that you're, if you're

01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:16.460
[Guest]: putting up an oxygen plant in Chitradurga? Well, you'd like somebody in Chitradurga other

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:22.380
[Guest]: than the divisional commissioner to sign off on that, right? So I'll get you that connect.

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:26.860
[Guest]: And then you, as the guy who actually gave that plant, can have that connect directly.

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:32.340
[Guest]: So in a way, I think these are the ways to construct that lasting thing. But I'll also

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:37.980
[Guest]: concede that these don't naturally lead to asking, how can you do this in housing and

01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:43.380
[Guest]: how can you do this in water supply and sanitation and all of that, and education in particular.

01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:48.500
[Guest]: It doesn't naturally lead to that, but it gives you a larger number of connections to

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:53.020
[Guest]: tap into. And if you choose to, you can begin to ask that question too.

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:58.220
[Guest]: Even in this thing itself, I've had, in the middle of a conversation about the response

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:01.660
[Guest]: to a pandemic, there have been people who say, I should separately, I want to talk to

01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:07.020
[Guest]: you about what we're doing in education. And I've said separately for now means temporarily.

01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:12.140
[Guest]: Separately means four weeks later, when actually when you're out of this stuff. But clearly

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:16.100
[Guest]: it's happening, right? People who are talking to me about delivering oxygen concentrators

01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:19.900
[Guest]: are saying, I want to show you what we're doing in this or that. And I'm sure they're

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:24.820
[Guest]: saying that to many others in that conversation as well. It has the potential. If you want

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:28.900
[Guest]: to be deliberate about that, you can do that. I started working with people for finally,

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:33.500
[Guest]: for the first time in India, we are seeing the emergence of a built to rent market for

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:38.140
[Guest]: housing, right? Almost all housing in this India is built to sell. We've never had built

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:42.860
[Guest]: to rent market. The emergence of a built to rent market has great potential for tackling

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:49.220
[Guest]: the affordable housing shortage. So now I know what to do with that if I have bandwidth

01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:52.860
[Guest]: for that. And the way to construct bandwidth is to tap into this large ecosystem and say

01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:55.140
[Guest]: three guys from that chase this problem.

01:20:55.140 --> 01:21:00.780
[Guest]: It's an interesting thing. It's certainly that what you're raising is an important thing.

01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:03.260
[Guest]: But I think there's a way to be deliberate about it.

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:07.740
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I agree with you entirely. You know, in my question, I didn't want there to be

01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:12.940
[Amit Varma]: an implication that I'm minimizing the importance of, you know, solving the proximate problems.

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:16.860
[Amit Varma]: And I just think that like you said that the long term effects, the unseen effects, as

01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:21.700
[Amit Varma]: it were, of building these networks and having people with good intent and a lot of money

01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:26.260
[Amit Varma]: actually get to know each other and all of that, I think the spin off effects are fantastic.

01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:30.260
[Amit Varma]: And maybe in the future, we'll solve some of our deeper problems. And speaking of deeper,

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:34.500
[Amit Varma]: we got to get deeper into many of the concrete things that you've been doing. But before

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:38.180
[Amit Varma]: that, let's take a quick commercial break. And on the other side of it, we'll get down

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:40.660
[Amit Varma]: to brass tacks.

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:44.380
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it? Well, I'd love

01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:48.540
[Amit Varma]: to help you. Over the last year, I've enjoyed teaching my online course, the art of clear

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:53.980
[Amit Varma]: writing, and an online community has now sprung up of all my past students. We have workshops,

01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:58.620
[Amit Varma]: a newsletter to showcase the work of students and vibrant community interaction that offers

01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:04.060
[Amit Varma]: much stimulation, and even some comfort in these difficult times. In the course itself,

01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:09.020
[Amit Varma]: through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know about the craft and practice

01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:14.060
[Amit Varma]: of clear writing. There are many exercises, much interaction and a lovely and lively community

01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:20.580
[Amit Varma]: at the end of it. The course cost rupees 10,000 plus GST, or about $150. And the June classes

01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:26.460
[Amit Varma]: begin on June 5. So if you're interested, head on over to register at India uncut.com

01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:32.340
[Amit Varma]: slash clear writing. That's India uncut.com slash clear writing. Being a good writer doesn't

01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:37.500
[Amit Varma]: require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard and a clear idea of what you

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:43.140
[Amit Varma]: need to do to refine your skills. I can help you.

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:48.060
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen. I'm chatting with Ashwin Mahesh about COVID-19

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:53.100
[Amit Varma]: and relief operations around COVID-19, where so many people surrounded by the pain and

01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:57.740
[Amit Varma]: misfortune that they saw all around them and often experienced stepped in to actually help

01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:02.820
[Amit Varma]: in whatever way they could. But before we get there, Ashwin wants to talk a little bit

01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:07.260
[Amit Varma]: about how we talk to each other, like not in the general idea sense of how we talk to

01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:12.540
[Amit Varma]: each other, communication has changed and all that. But down and dirty talk about apps.

01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:16.940
[Amit Varma]: He has, Ashwin, I am told has become a fan of telegram, which he forced me to download

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:22.800
[Amit Varma]: a coercive measure I did not resist surprise, surprise. So Ashwin, tell us about telegram

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.500
[Amit Varma]: and what's so special about it?

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:30.980
[Guest]: Well, you know, everybody has WhatsApp, right? So that's what the general population is like.

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:37.060
[Guest]: Everybody has WhatsApp. Some people also have telegram. And some people also have signal.

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:40.340
[Unknown]: They have it for a variety of reasons. But some people also have telegram and some people

01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:45.940
[Guest]: don't. In the development community, telegram is more common, simply because it's a way

01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:50.380
[Guest]: of separating certain conversations from the rest of the thing. And I'm sure I've seen

01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:55.020
[Guest]: this even with the bureaucracy, the telegram or signal is a channel in which they communicate

01:23:55.020 --> 01:24:00.860
[Guest]: among each other. And remember what I said about people do care, but they have a baseline

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:06.020
[Guest]: of caring that is proximate. And then there is a stuff that is above and beyond that they

01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:11.660
[Guest]: can get into. So the people who can get into the other realm are the guys who will say,

01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:17.940
[Guest]: if you say to them, download telegram, they'll do it. Right. And it's not coercive. I mean,

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:22.740
[Guest]: but it's they see the point. So one of the interesting things that has happened in the

01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:28.220
[Guest]: last two weeks is that a large number of my contacts and networks and lots of other people

01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:34.780
[Guest]: are now on telegram. And the reason they're on telegram is that the relief effort is running

01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:38.500
[Guest]: on telegram in some ways. I mean, at least the ones that I have great visibility into

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:43.220
[Guest]: the stronger ones are all running on telegram. And every once in a while, people will ask

01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:49.220
[Guest]: me, what's your WhatsApp? I say, well, I don't have WhatsApp. I tried it for a day. It didn't

01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:54.500
[Guest]: work for me. So I said, this is not for me. So I don't have WhatsApp. And people kind

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:59.420
[Guest]: of find that odd. How can you not have a WhatsApp number? I said, why should it be odd? Because

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:05.060
[Guest]: I never ask you for your Outlook ID or your Gmail ID. I ask you for your email ID. You

01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:09.860
[Guest]: can ask me if I have a messaging application and I can tell you that. They don't have interoperability.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:14.980
[Guest]: So you're asking about individual ones. But in general, you know, I mean, I've got telegram,

01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:18.940
[Guest]: I've got signal, I've got Skype, I've got a few other things, but I don't have WhatsApp.

01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:23.540
[Guest]: And what is interesting is that all these people at various levels in the last few days

01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:27.700
[Guest]: have heard people say, oh, you have telegram. What is that? I mean, I've heard about it.

01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:32.260
[Guest]: I know it's like a development. It's like Mozilla for the messaging world. And more

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:35.420
[Guest]: and more people are getting on to it. And that's really what's happening. And then there's

01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:40.860
[Guest]: a set of people who never had WhatsApp. And those are extremes, right? Like, whatever.

01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:45.100
[Guest]: But there's also a set of people who, even after they've heard about telegram, are not

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:51.660
[Guest]: going to do it. Right? They know that telegram is developed by a messaging, you know, Mozilla

01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:59.300
[Guest]: like community. It actually, their goal as a community is partly to build a certain kind

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:03.900
[Guest]: of technology with certain values built into it. And these values are different from what

01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:09.340
[Guest]: a Facebook or a Jack Ma would build into their products. But they still think, yeah, but

01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:12.860
[Guest]: I really want to be able to talk to lots of people. Because lots of people have WhatsApp.

01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:16.900
[Guest]: I know I want to have WhatsApp. And I can't have more than one app. Therefore, really,

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:20.620
[Guest]: I want to have WhatsApp. And really, that's the analogy that I see.

01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:26.820
[Guest]: There's a general population. There is a tippable population. There's an extreme population

01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:31.500
[Guest]: that didn't even need tipping because they've sort of grown up this way. And then there's

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:37.300
[Guest]: a large sort of, you know, distributions around the median of each of these kinds of things.

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:42.740
[Guest]: And definitely what I'm seeing in the last two weeks is a significant number of people

01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:48.140
[Guest]: getting on to telegram for the first time and joining lots and lots of groups on that.

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:56.020
[Guest]: So it was kind of in my mind, a kind of analogy to what you see in the larger space as well.

01:26:56.020 --> 01:27:01.020
[Guest]: And every day, I sort of encounter people making these choices for the first time. It's

01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:05.460
[Guest]: not about telegram, joining the larger relief effort for the first time. It's the first

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:10.380
[Guest]: time they've been tipped over into joining this community. It's kind of interesting to

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:15.900
[Guest]: see how enthusiastic they are about it and how they jump into connecting in ways that

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:20.500
[Guest]: they always knew were possible. But it's now real for them that they've actually tried

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:24.020
[Guest]: it. Okay, now we can sort of continue with that.

01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:29.180
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, I'll just kind of quickly respond to this and say that I don't know how permanent

01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:32.900
[Amit Varma]: this is. Because you know, a while back, there was this move where everybody wanted to move

01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:37.700
[Amit Varma]: from WhatsApp and I downloaded Signal for that. So I face this dilemma that I run this

01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:42.540
[Amit Varma]: online writing course, and I'm now in my 13th month. I started it last year when lockdown

01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:49.500
[Amit Varma]: began. And I've had more than like 1100 students so far, and out of which about 650 are part

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:54.780
[Amit Varma]: of this writing community that kind of continued and it's a volunteer community, it runs itself,

01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:59.140
[Amit Varma]: we do workshops, they give each other prompts, there are reading groups for fiction and nonfiction,

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:02.660
[Amit Varma]: a lot of stuff is happening, and it's completely free of charge for everyone who's done the

01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:07.180
[Amit Varma]: course. So it's about 650 people. Now the big limitation is how do we talk your email

01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:11.260
[Amit Varma]: is like your home base. But WhatsApp is where most of the chatter takes place, but they

01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:16.420
[Amit Varma]: have a limit of 256 people per group. So the 256 who happen to be on are talking all the

01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:21.540
[Amit Varma]: time there are like 200 messages a day they're discussing writing is useful is great. But

01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:26.740
[Amit Varma]: how do you involve everyone and we've tried experiments like, like one medium that I really

01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:31.620
[Amit Varma]: would like to make ubiquitous for the group is discord, which is also a way through which

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:37.660
[Amit Varma]: creators stay in touch with their audiences. And I love it because you can you can do little

01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:42.900
[Amit Varma]: audio rooms that you can do presentations that you can have zoomish kind of sessions

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:47.900
[Amit Varma]: there. It's really an interesting space, you know, I stopped using signal after I downloaded

01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:52.980
[Amit Varma]: it and went on for a bit. And I probably won't use telegram much. And part of the reason

01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:59.140
[Amit Varma]: is that network effects, right, you just you will just end up having more people available

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:04.060
[Amit Varma]: to you on WhatsApp, although I exited a whole bunch of groups, because, you know, a lot

01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:07.980
[Amit Varma]: of WhatsApp groups, if they're not family WhatsApp groups, which are just sending forwards

01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:13.860
[Amit Varma]: all the time, also disintegrate into kind of shitting on other people, you know, and

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:17.760
[Amit Varma]: nothing productive at all. And people just do that the whole freaking day you're gossiping

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:23.060
[Amit Varma]: about people who aren't there. And which, you know, in a sense also happens on parts

01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:27.340
[Amit Varma]: of social media, which I just hate. But anyway, data side apart, I mean, I don't know who

01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:31.300
[Amit Varma]: will give us relief from that. But I'm not as optimistic as you are about telegram, because

01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:35.460
[Amit Varma]: I know that I got on because you asked me to get on. But I don't think I'll stay on

01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:40.180
[Amit Varma]: to be very honest, because mental bandwidth is limited, which is another reason enough

01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:44.280
[Amit Varma]: people don't participate in relief, like over here, they may be because everything seems

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:49.140
[Amit Varma]: so urgent. But once this has receded, then the old normal will be the new normal again.

01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:54.540
[Amit Varma]: But I hope there are some changes which linger on. But I think listeners must now be a little

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:59.780
[Amit Varma]: exasperated that ye log bahut high level baate kar rahe hain, get down to the point. Let's

01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.460
[Amit Varma]: talk about COVID relief.

01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:07.020
[Guest]: Okay, how shall I begin? So there are, like I said, I sent you that spectrum of things

01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:14.460
[Guest]: that need to be looked at, that covers, you know, a very large number of things. But let's

01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:22.100
[Guest]: start with the stuff that is needed immediately, right? You've got a situation on the ground,

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:30.300
[Guest]: in which decades of deficit in health infrastructure, let's focus on health infrastructure, decades

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:39.300
[Guest]: of deficit in health infrastructure, and weaknesses in how quickly government can do anything

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:48.300
[Guest]: have led to a situation where the virus has overwhelmed you. You don't have 2x demand

01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:55.580
[Guest]: in any facility, you have 10x demand, 20x demand in many facilities. So the immediate

01:30:55.580 --> 01:31:03.740
[Guest]: requirement is, start building that infrastructure back up as quickly as possible. And you identify

01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:07.900
[Guest]: all the pieces of that infrastructure. It is what it is, you know, frankly, I'd never

01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:11.900
[Guest]: heard of like PSA plants and oxygen cylinders and all of these kinds of things being used

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:16.020
[Guest]: in hospital environment, but it is what it is, you make a list of all the stuff, you

01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:19.860
[Guest]: figure out who has what, you figure out who doesn't have what, which is actually a much

01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:26.180
[Guest]: longer list. And you say, okay, look, there's no way you can meet this demand. But you start

01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:31.900
[Guest]: to pick places where you feel you can deliver some of these things reasonably quickly, because

01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:37.100
[Guest]: you know where they are available. You know donors who are willing to pay for it. And

01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:44.260
[Guest]: you know, if you can connect the dots between all of them, stuff will get moving on the

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:50.020
[Guest]: ground. Of course, in due course, large donors will buy even more of this. It is what it

01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:55.300
[Guest]: is. So the first thing you do is you start the supply chain in some way, you enable the

01:31:55.300 --> 01:32:03.300
[Guest]: supply chain to say, we're not going to buy, but we'll help you buy. You don't know anything

01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:08.180
[Guest]: about cylinders. But because we have helped so many people buy cylinders, we know something

01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:12.700
[Guest]: about cylinders, and we know what to ask and how to negotiate and all of that stuff. You

01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:15.900
[Guest]: don't know anything about the government, but because we talk to the government all

01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:20.540
[Guest]: the time, we have some idea of who's asking for what from every district. I have a long

01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:26.300
[Guest]: list of requirements from every district commissioner. So we'll do the best we can in matching money,

01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:35.340
[Guest]: materials, and need. So you start that relay. And you do it for various product lines, oxygen

01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:41.340
[Guest]: cylinders, concentrators, N95 masks, whatever, some seven or eight things like that are there.

01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:47.620
[Guest]: You run that thing for as many product lines as you can. And you say, now I've got a functioning

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:54.580
[Guest]: procurement channel. It's actually interesting. It's a channel in which you don't do anything,

01:32:54.580 --> 01:33:00.460
[Guest]: but other than enable the channel, everybody else does what their individual, the donor

01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:07.580
[Guest]: gives money, the manufacturer makes the product, the public administration receives and indexes.

01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:10.940
[Guest]: You don't do anything, but you are present everywhere. You're present in the conversation

01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:15.740
[Guest]: with the donor. You're present in the premises of the manufacturer to check out what the

01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:19.860
[Guest]: hell that guy is doing, because you can't really start sending the stuff before you

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:24.740
[Guest]: understand what on earth is going on. And you are present in the local office of the

01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:30.420
[Guest]: DC or the Taluk hospital where the thing is actually being handed over. And so you have

01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:36.660
[Guest]: that. You build this thing. And after a while, people start to figure out if you're not working

01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:42.740
[Guest]: with one of the large procurers, there is actually only one way to get materials to

01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:48.540
[Guest]: happen. Either you must know somebody personally who on a private basis can do something, or

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:55.820
[Guest]: you have to reach out to a channel which is enabling this and say, enable my need also.

01:33:55.820 --> 01:34:01.540
[Guest]: So we started getting requests from other states. So Tamil Nadu would say, can you do

01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:06.700
[Guest]: this for us too? And Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, various states start to say, can you do this

01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:11.460
[Guest]: for us too? And we usually say, if you have some people on the ground who will also participate

01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:16.260
[Guest]: in this exercise, and who will also help us identify more places from which procurement

01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:20.860
[Guest]: can happen, and more donors who will cough up money for all of these kinds of things,

01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:27.420
[Guest]: we will keep adding the volunteer teams that will carry out the enabling role for you also,

01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:34.020
[Guest]: and you'll get more and more things. In this, there are two kinds of challenges. One is,

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:39.420
[Guest]: this whole process has lots of, I don't want to say gray areas, but it has lots of uncertainty.

01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:45.460
[Guest]: You don't even really know many things. And sometimes the guys who can do this, I mean,

01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:50.900
[Guest]: these, especially certain products like cylinders and all, they are usable across multiple industries.

01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:54.340
[Guest]: They're not just, you know, there may be oxygen cylinders, but a typical oxygen cylinder is

01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:59.700
[Guest]: usable, not just in a hospital. It's usable in many other settings as well. And the typical

01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:05.300
[Guest]: equipment like that has life of 60 years, 70 years, 80 years, whatever, several decades,

01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:09.380
[Guest]: certainly. The typical business in India doesn't have that kind of life. So they tend to go

01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:15.100
[Guest]: through multiple industries. They tend to have passed between multiple hands. So there's

01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:20.220
[Guest]: a certain system of saying, refurbish them, get them audited, get them tested, put them

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:24.580
[Guest]: back in service, only if you're confident that you can, blah, blah, blah.

01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:31.020
[Guest]: Getting all of this to move suddenly one day is not easy, simply because various guys are

01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:36.540
[Guest]: used to saying, ah, in a month I can do 200 of this. Suddenly the system is going to various

01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:41.340
[Guest]: people like that and say, can you do 2000 this month? Right? Nobody who's been doing

01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:47.020
[Guest]: 100 cylinders a month can suddenly do 2000, not only because of capital, because that's

01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:51.060
[Guest]: all it is, the raw material, the sourcing, the valves, the regulator. By the time you

01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:56.100
[Guest]: get all this stuff and do it, it's just going to take forever. Then there will be some truck

01:35:56.100 --> 01:36:01.620
[Guest]: driver who will have his own constraints. He's a, yehi gadi hai, isme jaayega, itna

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:06.140
[Guest]: hi aa jaayega. I can put only, you may have ordered 200 cylinders, but I can only put

01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:15.740
[Guest]: 180. And then you'll encounter situations which are truly moral problems. Two people

01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:23.380
[Guest]: want the same thing. Both are related to saving lives. Right? You have to do something. You

01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:29.820
[Guest]: can take the view that as a practical matter, I can only do this with one person. And therefore

01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:36.100
[Guest]: I have to let the other person go in some way to say, look, you find some other thing

01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:42.180
[Guest]: that can be helpful to you. We can't do that. You're not exactly playing God at that level,

01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:50.660
[Guest]: but you are sort of making choices that are not easy. It's not easy. Then you have even

01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:56.820
[Guest]: more morally complex problem. You know that the situation is desperate in one place. But

01:36:56.820 --> 01:37:02.100
[Guest]: the intermediary who is representing that desperation and saying, please give us this

01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:07.660
[Guest]: thing. You don't trust the guy. You don't trust the guy. Okay. You think if you give

01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:14.500
[Guest]: this to this guy, he will sell it in the black market. But you know that behind him is this

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:21.300
[Guest]: massively desperate group. You can either say, I'll try to go around the guy and find

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:25.580
[Guest]: the blah, blah, and I'll invest time in that. Or you can say, I can't do this thing. It

01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:31.460
[Guest]: has uncertainty written all over it. Even if this group has higher requirement, it is

01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:36.340
[Guest]: better that we give this stuff to some place where we feel confident that it will be used

01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:42.980
[Guest]: in a hospital facility without getting into some luffa. And also that you want to be accountable

01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:46.820
[Guest]: to the people who are spending this money. They're not giving it to me. They're actually

01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:49.940
[Guest]: giving it to the manufacturers. But still, you know, they're giving it to you because

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:53.380
[Guest]: they trust you. I mean, they're giving it to the manufacturer because they trust you.

01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:58.220
[Guest]: In a situation like that, you have accountability. Whether it is legal accountability or not,

01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:03.340
[Guest]: it's basically your word that is driving the system in some way. So there's a moral accountability

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:08.060
[Guest]: for that. So what happens in a situation, you're making a choice not to send something

01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:14.300
[Guest]: somewhere, even though you know for a fact that it's... And sometimes people in your

01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:20.980
[Guest]: own sort of circle that is trying to sort of help all this, it becomes a conversation

01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:26.980
[Guest]: in that circle. How can we do that? Right? How can we do that? And then you have sometimes

01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:31.180
[Unknown]: what will happen, the manufacturer himself is aware of a much higher need because so

01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:38.620
[Guest]: many people are reaching out to him as well. So there's a moral dilemma at that point.

01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:43.140
[Guest]: And also some things that he will say, you know, I've been working continuously for 28

01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:47.420
[Guest]: hours. I need a break. I can't just go on making stuff just because the need is very

01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:53.620
[Guest]: high. And sometimes the payments won't happen on time. It is what it is. Everybody wants

01:38:53.620 --> 01:39:00.300
[Guest]: advance payment, but sometimes it's just the way it is. So you have to sort of say, you

01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:06.220
[Guest]: have to do like a combination of the Bhagavad Gita and something else. I don't know what

01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:14.860
[Guest]: you'd call it. I sort of reduced it to three sentences. Dharma is subtle. That's all it

01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:21.260
[Guest]: is. Dharma is subtle. Morality is a luxury of peacetime. Shut the fuck up and do it.

01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:25.180
[Guest]: So but that's all it is. The first two are true. You're trying to say to the guy, I don't

01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:31.860
[Guest]: know the answers to these questions any more than you do. I, like you, have been put in

01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:39.620
[Guest]: a difficult situation by the overall catastrophe that all of us find ourselves in and by our

01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:46.540
[Guest]: own voluntary decisions to do something about it. This is not a decision that you can execute

01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:53.780
[Guest]: without a certain degree of, what's the word? Whatever's the opposite of equanimity. I don't

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:58.460
[Guest]: know what that is, right? That gumption is what I would say. If you don't have a degree

01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:04.340
[Guest]: of gumption about doing this kind of thing, you can't do it. That's how it is, right?

01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:10.100
[Guest]: And I think for a lot of people who are joining this stuff, if you do this for four weeks,

01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:15.980
[Guest]: it's more work experience than what you can do, get in a company or a job working for

01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:22.980
[Guest]: two years. And that's actually true because autonomy comes with the responsibility. The

01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:26.820
[Guest]: demand is way more than anywhere the group can meet. So you're all over the place doing

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:31.900
[Guest]: all sorts of things. Ultimately, over a period of time, you're just settling down into a

01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:38.460
[Guest]: rhythm that says, I know who can close what, who I know in a trustable way, not just trust

01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:45.380
[Guest]: as in a probity, but trust as in he's done it before, right? And then lots of challenges

01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:50.340
[Guest]: will come and you'll get reminded of various things that sort of, I mean, sometimes you

01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:54.780
[Guest]: get to a depressing situation where you'll say, should we try to do all these things?

01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:59.460
[Guest]: I'm going to give you an example. I'm not going to tell, sometimes I can't tell you

01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:06.580
[Guest]: the specifics. That's just life. There was a hospital in which some people died because

01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:13.220
[Guest]: of some thing, some equipment just not working. And this is like, I mean, it's not in Karnataka,

01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:19.100
[Guest]: but we were anyway trying to help. But there was also a sense in the administration

01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:27.580
[Guest]: there that we don't want to be seen as accepting private sector help. So it's a calculus inside

01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:32.460
[Guest]: the political leadership in that space. It's whatever it is. I don't want to get into why,

01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:37.620
[Guest]: but that's what you're hearing. You have gone to the trouble of transporting something at

01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:45.580
[Guest]: great combination of effort and expense to the doorstep of that facility. The administrator

01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:53.500
[Guest]: of that facility says to you, off the record, we need it. We just can't take it. Right?

01:41:53.500 --> 01:42:01.220
[Guest]: Now you have to say, put it back on the truck, move it. I'm not in this. I can't solve this

01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:06.380
[Guest]: problem. I can't solve this problem, but it happens. Then there are all these, there's

01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:11.220
[Guest]: a lot of buffoonery also, just complete buffoonery. Lots of people have collected this concentrate,

01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:17.220
[Guest]: kept them in their own properties as insurance. They think that an oxygen concentrator in

01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:20.780
[Guest]: their clubhouse is going to really do something for them. They have no idea this is a post-COVID

01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:25.700
[Guest]: medical device to be used in a hospital facility. Lots of guys have bought five liter. And it's

01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:29.700
[Guest]: not just like ordinary guys who you think will not know enough to distinguish. Some

01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:34.060
[Guest]: of the major donors have bought the wrong thing. And they bought thousands of it. And

01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:39.220
[Guest]: then people go to the government or to somebody who's helping, like me, and say, somebody

01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:43.900
[Guest]: will call me up once and say, I have bought two oxygen plants. They're coming in the next

01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:49.660
[Guest]: two, three days. Well, what should I do with them? I'm like, dude, you bought an oxygen

01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:54.100
[Guest]: plant, right? You didn't buy a cylinder. You didn't buy something that's like, it's not

01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:59.620
[Guest]: off the shelf. You bought something that is actually equipment that needs installation

01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:06.100
[Guest]: in the premises of a facility and integration through piping and other connectivity to the

01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:12.140
[Guest]: service provided. And you didn't think of this thing before you got it, right? And now

01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:16.220
[Guest]: you want to know where it should be put. But there are people like that. There is stuff

01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:21.300
[Guest]: like that in the country. It's just, I think about 10, 15% of the money is just floating

01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:25.340
[Guest]: around in completely useless stuff. And if you channelize, if that had been channelized

01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:29.420
[Guest]: properly, a lot of things could have been done differently. And then there are guys

01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:39.100
[Guest]: who will say, you will have your paying agency, right? I have several who can help because

01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:44.380
[Guest]: many NGOs can help pay many bills. That person will say, you have to fill out some paper.

01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:50.220
[Guest]: You have to become a registered vendor in our system. You have to become, you know,

01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:53.340
[Unknown]: everybody's got a system for registering this country, like this mindless amount of data

01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:57.940
[Guest]: collection, right? I want to know everything about you before I help you, but I'm not going

01:43:57.940 --> 01:44:02.340
[Guest]: to tell you whether I'm going to help you. And in the process, since you're asking so

01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:07.260
[Guest]: much information about me, I'll also ask you similar amounts of information about you.

01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:10.820
[Guest]: So the net result is that we exchange massive amounts of information with each other, but

01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:15.340
[Guest]: the transaction itself might not happen. There's a lot of that kind of stuff too, but the need

01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:19.900
[Guest]: is on the ground all the time right now, right? And some people will go out of their way to

01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:24.900
[Guest]: say, take a badminton. It'll sort itself out. We'll send it. You deal with this later.

01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:32.300
[Guest]: I feel this challenge of deciding what to give where is going to become morally more

01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:38.020
[Guest]: complex as the virus goes into the villages. We have done something in the villages, which

01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:43.100
[Guest]: has many consequences. The first consequence is, I'll tell you also what we have done.

01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:48.220
[Guest]: The first thing that happened is that in many states, there was a wholesale transfer of

01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:54.980
[Guest]: the health staff who are working at these primary levels, you know, PHCs and community

01:44:54.980 --> 01:45:01.820
[Guest]: health centers in particular, to the district and taluk hospitals and to the city hospitals.

01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:06.180
[Guest]: So the thinking I think at that time was, this virus is attacking the cities. We have

01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:10.420
[Guest]: to stop the virus in the cities. If we don't stop it in the cities, you will never be able

01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:16.020
[Guest]: to deal with this thing if it hits the countryside. But the thing is, you didn't stop it in the

01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:20.540
[Guest]: cities, despite all of this. And of course, it was never possible to stop it this way

01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:26.100
[Guest]: in the city anyway. And so while you did all that you thought you were doing to stop it

01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:30.260
[Guest]: in the city, the virus went to the countryside. Now in the countryside, you have all these

01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:37.700
[Guest]: PHCs and CHCs, which have been denuded of their staff. And several of them have thousands

01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:43.580
[Guest]: of COVID positive cases in their jurisdiction. So there are PHCs out there who say, in my

01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:47.700
[Guest]: jurisdiction, about 2,000 people are COVID positive. I mean, like, 2,000 people being

01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:53.580
[Guest]: COVID positive in a jurisdiction is like, we also have roads, we also have pipes. At

01:45:53.580 --> 01:46:00.300
[Guest]: the moment, it's become ubiquitous in some way, right? There are several places like

01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:05.460
[Guest]: that. But there's only one person there. And they don't have anything like the kind of

01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:11.700
[Guest]: equipment that they need, even to do the sorting. And the kind of thing that was organized in

01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:17.100
[Guest]: Mumbai, where ward level committees figured out how to triage and separate various people.

01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:21.500
[Guest]: In theory, a village community could do that. But in practice, they don't know how to do

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:25.580
[Guest]: it. Nobody's actually there to train them, even the first day, to give one day of training

01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:33.980
[Guest]: to get that going. The capacity to intervene in the rural communities, the small communities,

01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:38.580
[Guest]: and the remote communities is just completely not there. As the virus has moved into those

01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:45.660
[Guest]: communities, the sheer terror of... I mean, the biologists will tell you that this is

01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:54.780
[Guest]: not a lethally infectious virus. As viruses go, this thing is manageable. But it's hit

01:46:54.780 --> 01:47:01.300
[Guest]: a very large number of people. And those people are running into a completely missing infrastructure

01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:08.380
[Guest]: for support. And they're doing it in volumes that the system itself is overwhelmed by.

01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:12.460
[Guest]: This is all to one side of the story. And then you're trying to do something really

01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:17.980
[Guest]: quick in the middle of all of this stuff. And then there are these technical issues.

01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:22.020
[Guest]: Not technical issues, reality technical issues. I don't know what you'd call them. I'll give

01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:26.940
[Guest]: you an example. A typical hospital runs on the assumption that the majority of people

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:32.620
[Guest]: in the hospital don't need oxygen support. Some of about, yeah, I don't know, let's say

01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:37.660
[Guest]: 60, 70% of the people can just need general ward level support. There's a bunch of people

01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:42.420
[Guest]: that need oxygen in a highly attentive unit, and maybe a small percentage that need an

01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:50.500
[Guest]: ICU bed. And even if you have an oxygen plant, typically it is set up under that assumption

01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:55.380
[Guest]: that there is a distribution of requirement, therefore you get a plant of a certain capacity.

01:47:55.380 --> 01:48:01.860
[Guest]: Now you're saying we need to buy PSAs and put it in every hospital. Because the hospitals

01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:07.620
[Guest]: are all overwhelmed with people who need ICU beds and high attention beds. But the problem

01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:12.860
[Guest]: is now you need a different kind of plant. The plant that you need is not to cater to

01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:19.420
[Guest]: 15 or 20% of the beds being occupied by these kinds of patients. But then you had two kinds

01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:23.420
[Guest]: of problems. One, the piping infrastructure inside the hospital is not set up for this

01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:29.980
[Guest]: kind of external thing. So there are pressure-related issues in some cases. But equally, this becomes

01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:35.660
[Guest]: a problem for the donor community. The donor community also starts asking, okay, I'm going

01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:40.340
[Guest]: to buy this PSA plant, which can cater to a very large number of whatever. But actually

01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:45.260
[Guest]: this is overkill for what is needed in the post-COVID scenario. So should we really be

01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:51.460
[Guest]: buying this? Shouldn't we be doing something else that is more modular, can be shifted

01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:55.740
[Guest]: somewhere? So essentially you spend time trying to sort the answer to that question. There

01:48:55.740 --> 01:49:00.820
[Guest]: may be a reasonable way to do that, but maybe you can do a sequence of a serial of five

01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:06.940
[Guest]: small plants instead of one large plant. There are things you can do. But this is one part

01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:10.660
[Guest]: of it. What I'm trying to say is that the infrastructure's readiness to absorb what

01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:18.220
[Guest]: you are giving itself is having certain complexities in it. Then in the infrastructure side, there's

01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:23.980
[Guest]: a distinction you have to make between storage infrastructure and the materials that get

01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:28.660
[Guest]: delivered into that storage. So if you have an oxygen cylinder or an oxygen plant, an

01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:34.860
[Guest]: LMO, liquid metal oxygen plant, somebody has to take oxygen to it. The oxygen supply cannot

01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:38.620
[Guest]: suddenly increase. Yes, the government is doing something by saying talk to the steel

01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:44.780
[Guest]: manufacturers, talk to the cement manufacturers and increase the oxygen supply. But what this

01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:50.300
[Guest]: means is until you find a more stable and alternate source of oxygen supply, the steel

01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:57.340
[Guest]: and cement industries are shut down. In some way, you are caught in the choices that you

01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:04.460
[Guest]: have made to address one problem because those very choices have made it impossible to solve

01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:10.260
[Guest]: another problem as well. And there's an undersupply. If you need 10 of something, even with these

01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:14.740
[Guest]: kinds of intervention, you'll only have six. In some sense, the government has been put

01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:18.460
[Guest]: in a very difficult position of saying some people are going to get oxygen, other people

01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:24.180
[Guest]: are not going to get oxygen. That's all it is. And even if you say, well, all hospitals

01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:29.980
[Guest]: are getting oxygen in some level, that is only because the demand at the hospital is

01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:35.660
[Guest]: 300, they're admitting only 25. Those 25 are getting oxygen. You are really about the depth

01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:40.700
[Guest]: of 10 or 15 people in a hospital, 25 people in a hospital. Those are the 25 people that

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:47.020
[Guest]: managed to get into the hospital. The demand at that very hospital was 300. There isn't

01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:51.740
[Guest]: a new story about what happened to the 275 who didn't get into the hospital because they

01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:57.180
[Guest]: died one by one at home, many of them. And that number is probably more than the 25 that

01:50:57.180 --> 01:51:03.940
[Guest]: died in the hospital. So you have a situation in which your record collection about the

01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:11.540
[Guest]: casualties is vastly dependent on the infrastructure, but the infrastructure is rejecting the majority

01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:16.540
[Guest]: of the people that come to it. So your data is all wrong. So when people are like, you

01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:20.740
[Guest]: know, you've seen Shamika's curve, those diagrams and all of those kinds of things, you know,

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:27.780
[Guest]: those bars and charts that keep coming. I think as data analysis, okay, it's a technique.

01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:31.540
[Guest]: If you want to learn some techniques like that, it's not a bad thing to follow that

01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:39.020
[Guest]: and learn some techniques. But as comprehension of reality, I don't even like, you know, I'm

01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:43.380
[Guest]: actually looking to see, is there a nice visualization strategy about data in this thing? I'm not

01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:47.940
[Guest]: even looking at what the data is. I don't believe that data at all. And lots of people

01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:52.380
[Guest]: will tell you, no, no, no, how can you say that? This is all official. And I'm saying,

01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:59.740
[Guest]: of course, everything is official. Have you seen the officials? Right? Right? They themselves

01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:05.340
[Guest]: will tell you, sir, this is what we can put on paper because this is what is on paper.

01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:11.900
[Guest]: This is not the reality, right? So that is, this is all, I mean, I'll pause here. I don't

01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:16.620
[Guest]: know if you want to have any questions to this sort of thing. This is a complex environment

01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:24.220
[Guest]: in which you're first trying to intervene. You as a lay person from the outside, I mean,

01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:29.020
[Guest]: fortunately, in a group like the one that we're constructing, there are hospital administrators

01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:33.460
[Guest]: who have done this job before in their own hospitals. So they have some knowledge like

01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:37.540
[Guest]: Ashwin Naik from Vatsalya, for example. He's done this job before, right? People like that

01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:42.780
[Guest]: who've done some job, someone you know has run a hospital. So you're counting on their

01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:49.420
[Guest]: expertise to say, this can be done, that can be done, and all of that stuff. But the vast

01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:53.700
[Guest]: majority of people doing this stuff have never been anywhere near a hospital. I mean, at

01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:58.260
[Guest]: some level, the generalist leadership of the administrative services have also never generally

01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:02.860
[Guest]: been before in front of a hospital. So it's in that sense, not very different. But it

01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:09.260
[Guest]: also complicates the problem even more. No one really knows what the right thing to be

01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:16.340
[Guest]: done is. You're just learning that on the fly, approximating it, and meeting a small

01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:22.540
[Guest]: portion of even that need while you're doing it. That's the current situation. Meanwhile,

01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:27.380
[Guest]: the thing is flaring out of hand. And the science, I mean, I don't trust what they say

01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:34.100
[Guest]: at the science level at all. Because if you see, the genome guys around the country are

01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:39.500
[Guest]: telling you about 20,000 sequences have been done in India since the pandemic started.

01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:43.420
[Guest]: And in most states, they've not done more than a few hundred, right? How the hell can

01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:48.060
[Guest]: you tell what this virus looks like today if you're not actually doing the genome sequencing

01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:53.460
[Guest]: day in and day out to understand what it's mutating into? But there are also some guys

01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:59.720
[Guest]: who are saying, this has been a remarkably stable virus. It hasn't mutated very much

01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:06.660
[Guest]: in the conventional sense or extent of how much mutations happen. This virus hasn't done

01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:13.100
[Guest]: too much. So there's a hope. It's a reasonable expectation, more than hope, that the vaccines

01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:19.260
[Guest]: that are already out there should continue to work for even the mutations that have already

01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:24.580
[Guest]: happened or the ones that we realistically think could happen. That's a bit of a hope

01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:30.120
[Guest]: in the sense, you really don't know that to be true, but maybe there's a statistical certainty

01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:35.740
[Guest]: of some of that. But I'd still like to see the sequencing done all the time.

01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:40.180
[Guest]: The vaccine rollout is another problem, right? The vaccine rollout is just basic mathematics.

01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:45.380
[Guest]: 1.4 billion people, you know, leave out the children. That gives you, what, 900 million

01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:50.500
[Guest]: people that you need to vaccinate, two doses, 1.8 billion doses. The capacity inside the

01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:55.860
[Guest]: country is not more than 70 million doses per month. Government isn't really giving

01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:59.860
[Guest]: enough money to boost that capacity to these guys. They might get to 100 million doses

01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:05.940
[Guest]: a month by August. At 100 million doses a month, you're going to get to complete vaccination

01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:11.420
[Guest]: only in the middle or late part of 2022. Of course, you could introduce more vaccines

01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:16.420
[Guest]: into that thing, but that itself is a process. And the process of saying this is approved,

01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:21.420
[Guest]: not approved, I can buy, you can buy, states can buy. And also the reporting of this has

01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:26.420
[Guest]: been really bad. There have been many, many, many reports saying we are running the world's

01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:33.420
[Guest]: largest vaccination program. Of course, we'll run the world's largest anything. You've got

01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:37.820
[Guest]: the world's largest number of people. Anything that has to do with people count, you will

01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:41.940
[Guest]: be running the world's largest number of that, right? And then by some indications, actually,

01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:46.860
[Guest]: the Chinese population is already either close to or lower than our population. So we might

01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:50.820
[Guest]: actually have a situation where the population is bigger than the Chinese population. To

01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:56.100
[Guest]: say that you're the world's largest program for this or that makes no sense. What percentage

01:55:56.100 --> 01:56:00.420
[Guest]: of the people that need to receive this have received it? That makes sense. If you have

01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:03.940
[Guest]: the world's largest program for something, how is it that so many other countries are

01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:07.580
[Guest]: finishing their vaccinations before you are? Because you have a lot more people. That's

01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:13.060
[Guest]: all it is. But the second level reporting is not happening in the media at all. The

01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:20.180
[Guest]: media is quite happy to report the headline. The headline is often coming from a press

01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:27.180
[Guest]: release. And in fact, I've seen one other thing, which is that the first three paragraphs

01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:35.100
[Guest]: of any news article are simply restatements of each other. Amit Verma said today that

01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:41.700
[Guest]: 70,000 vaccines will be available by the middle of September. In only a short period of four

01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:48.540
[Guest]: months, this means that India will have increased its capacity. There's no real content there

01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:52.780
[Guest]: except what's in the first sentence, but you can write that for three and a half paragraphs.

01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:57.660
[Guest]: There's a lot of that because they're just doing their 300 words or 400 words in the

01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:05.060
[Guest]: newspaper alone. So I think I should stop. I'm telling you a very large number of complex

01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:10.460
[Guest]: cities to deal with. But I can do this for three hours.

01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:17.500
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you should. I wish I could make you do this for three more hours. So lots to process

01:57:17.500 --> 01:57:23.140
[Amit Varma]: here. But let me sort of come to sort of restate a theoretical condition that you spoke about

01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:28.980
[Amit Varma]: and ask you to sort of get more concrete about it to aid our understanding, which is, of

01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:32.580
[Amit Varma]: course, a problem of triaging, where you said that, look, we're making moral choices all

01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:37.140
[Amit Varma]: the time. We are surrounded by incredible scarcity, not a little scarcity, but an incredible

01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:42.300
[Amit Varma]: scarcity. If there are 25 beds in a hospital, you have 300 people who are fighting for those.

01:57:42.300 --> 01:57:46.060
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, the data will only capture to which of those 25 died when they did not

01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:51.820
[Amit Varma]: get oxygen, not about the 275 left out. That's a great point. Now, the thing with this triaging

01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:57.220
[Amit Varma]: is I completely get it that, let's say that you get a donor, donor gives you money to

01:57:57.220 --> 01:58:02.780
[Amit Varma]: get cylinders made and to have oxygen put in them. But you have X number of cylinders,

01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:07.460
[Amit Varma]: you know, A wants him, B wants him, C wants him, maybe you can save more lives in C, but

01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:12.340
[Amit Varma]: probabilistic estimates come in because your interface with C is not so reliable, you don't

01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:17.060
[Amit Varma]: know how much likely it is to get there. So you have to take all of that into account.

01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:22.820
[Amit Varma]: Plus, what you don't always realize is that, you know, what is useful information in the

01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:27.340
[Amit Varma]: fog of war, there is so much information flowing around, like in the early part of the second

01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:31.660
[Amit Varma]: wave, there were all these calls being amplified on social media for say plasma, which we know

01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:36.300
[Amit Varma]: does not work for remdesivir, which most of the time does not work. It's a very limited

01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:42.180
[Amit Varma]: use case. And in no use case does it even delay fatalities or seriousness, for example.

01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:47.700
[Amit Varma]: And you know, it's possible that there is misdirection of effort and resources over

01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:52.860
[Amit Varma]: there. So my question is about, you know, I mean, obviously, you need to think probabilistically

01:58:52.860 --> 01:58:57.080
[Amit Varma]: and think about where you can get, I won't say bang for the buck, but the most positive

01:58:57.080 --> 01:59:01.720
[Amit Varma]: impact in terms of being able to save lives for whatever effort you can put in. But before

01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:06.100
[Amit Varma]: you do that, you need information. There is this fog of information. So two questions

01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:11.260
[Amit Varma]: really, one is, how does that evolve? Like do you develop what economists will call fast

01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:16.180
[Amit Varma]: and frugal heuristics for guiding decision making? It's on the basis of these things

01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:21.420
[Amit Varma]: that I make these decisions. How much does that fog of war in terms of information affect

01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:26.180
[Amit Varma]: you? And secondly, I'd really like you to get concrete without taking names of people

01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:32.140
[Amit Varma]: or institutions, perhaps, but just to give us a better sense of actual choices that you

01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:37.380
[Amit Varma]: have faced in the field and how you've resolved them. And, you know, the dilemmas contained

01:59:37.380 --> 01:59:40.460
[Amit Varma]: within. Can you can you bring that alive for us?

01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:49.700
[Guest]: OK, so let's take the first one, the question about information. So we have a system of

01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:55.100
[Guest]: saying there are needs and there are verified needs. Every need has the potential to be

01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:59.380
[Guest]: a verified need. And just because you have not verified them doesn't mean it's not a

01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:04.700
[Guest]: legitimate need. But one of the moral choices you have to make is that you're only going

02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:13.340
[Guest]: to respond to verified needs. So those are very real. You have asked for something. Someone

02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:18.460
[Guest]: else has asked for something else. I know for a fact that your ask is legitimate. I

02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:22.860
[Guest]: have only one of those things anyway. So I would say, look, I don't need to ask the other

02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:27.580
[Guest]: guy if his need is legitimate. I only have one. I know Amit's need is legitimate. I have

02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:34.380
[Guest]: verified it. So give the thing to Amit. So that happens all the time because you're dealing

02:00:34.380 --> 02:00:43.940
[Guest]: only with verifiable needs. The second thing is, you know somebody on the ground who is

02:00:43.940 --> 02:00:49.380
[Guest]: telling you the situation on the ground is different from what the administration is

02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:54.740
[Guest]: telling you. This happens too. It's not because the administration is misleading you. Sometimes

02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:58.460
[Guest]: there's a risk of that. But by and large, that's not the issue. The administration is

02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:02.380
[Guest]: telling you something. Typically, what will happen in a state government is if you say,

02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:05.740
[Guest]: what do you need? If you go to Andhra Pradesh state government and say, what do you need?

02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:11.140
[Guest]: They will give you a list of requirements from every district commissioner. If you need

02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:17.900
[Guest]: 10 cylinders or 15 concentrators or 10 ventilators, when you fill out that document asking for

02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:23.500
[Guest]: those things, you will add a zero to every one of them. I guarantee it. Nobody will ask

02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:29.140
[Guest]: for exactly what they need. They'll always ask for a lot more than what they need. And

02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:32.900
[Guest]: of course, now the donor community is chasing very large numbers of these kinds of things

02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:37.660
[Guest]: being asked for because those are the official requests. The official requests are for things

02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:43.180
[Guest]: that are in some cases far in excess of what is actually needed. But in some cases, that

02:01:43.180 --> 02:01:48.220
[Guest]: many will not be needed because everybody's chasing that same list. I have seen that there's

02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:54.820
[Guest]: one list that's floating around, which is this global sourcing of PSA plants. The guys

02:01:54.820 --> 02:02:01.780
[Guest]: who wrote that list, I got that list directly from them. But the number of people who have

02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:05.780
[Guest]: incidentally brought that list to my attention saying, I got it from so-and-so, I got it

02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:11.900
[Guest]: from so-and-so, and who genuinely believe they've found another set of sources from

02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:15.580
[Guest]: which you can buy, it's very high. So you're spending a lot of time just comparing some

02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:18.820
[Guest]: small things and saying, this is the same thing, this is the same thing. And then the

02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:25.900
[Guest]: strategy, here's the thing. You're trying to buy something from a certain plant in Korea.

02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:32.300
[Guest]: I'm giving you an example. I know for a fact that somebody is trying to buy the plant itself.

02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:37.980
[Guest]: You understand? I can tell you that, but I have no certainty that the person is actually

02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:42.860
[Guest]: going to complete buying that plant either. But if I tell you that, you're going to say,

02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:46.780
[Guest]: oh, maybe I shouldn't follow this lead because if somebody else is going to buy out the whole

02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:49.900
[Guest]: plant, when am I going to get anything done over here?

02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:56.620
[Guest]: So what I'm trying to say is there are these kinds of dilemmas, which are not quite gray

02:02:56.620 --> 02:03:04.820
[Guest]: areas, but which are simply choices at various points. But there are also gray areas. The

02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:11.860
[Guest]: reality is that nothing is without a gray area. And in those, you really have to ask

02:03:11.860 --> 02:03:17.580
[Guest]: yourself, are you willing to go through the gray area because it is necessary? Or is there

02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:23.020
[Guest]: a way of beating down the extent of the gray so that, frankly, instead of 60% gray, it's

02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:28.380
[Guest]: only 10% gray? At some level, Amit, I can't really talk about that. And you can understand

02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:34.980
[Guest]: why it's not, because it's a lot of other people making choices like that as well.

02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:41.900
[Guest]: But in some ways, it is necessary. That's all it is. It's necessary that when you are

02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:50.340
[Guest]: buying a scarce product or a service, it is again and again necessary to say only some

02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:59.900
[Guest]: people will get it. When the process of making that thing itself has 10 steps. But I'll put

02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:04.420
[Guest]: it to you like this. If one of those steps will take seven days and the rest of the steps

02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:11.780
[Guest]: can be done in seven hours. And if somebody says to you, sir, that one step that takes

02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:18.900
[Guest]: seven days, it's not necessary. And you also know for a fact that the center at which that

02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:25.580
[Guest]: seventh step is doing something can only do a very, very small subset of what is brought

02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:29.620
[Guest]: to it. So you have a situation on the ground where very large numbers of people are doing

02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:35.380
[Guest]: what it takes to save lives. There is no standard operating procedure to save lives. This is

02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:40.140
[Guest]: the reality. Since there is no standard operating procedure to save lives, you have to do what

02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:45.460
[Guest]: you think is helpful to save lives. Is it possible for people to turn around and say

02:04:45.460 --> 02:04:50.540
[Guest]: you did not follow the standard operating procedure? Yes, it is possible. Would you

02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:54.140
[Guest]: save more lives if you did not follow the standard operating procedure? Who knows? I

02:04:54.140 --> 02:04:59.060
[Guest]: have no idea of knowing that. I'm not the expert in these things. It's not even my job.

02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:03.540
[Guest]: I mean, the number of times in which within the group, we have said to each other, we

02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:10.220
[Guest]: shouldn't be doing this. We are not the people to do this is very high. And that's really

02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:19.900
[Guest]: an odd thing because, you know, you are procuring an oximeter or an oxygen concentrator. Frankly,

02:05:19.900 --> 02:05:24.820
[Guest]: I couldn't have recognized that thing for several days after we got started on this

02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:30.380
[Guest]: thing. I was only hoping that the guys doing the actual procurement had seen that thing

02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:37.500
[Guest]: in some way. But what I'm saying is, you're carrying out a lot of stuff of which you have

02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:44.660
[Guest]: only limited knowledge. And you are completely aware that this could lead, at the very least,

02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:49.980
[Guest]: to loss of money. And I'll give you another example of stuff. There are guys who have

02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:56.860
[Guest]: bought equipment, thinking that it serves a certain capacity, a certain purpose, and

02:05:56.860 --> 02:06:02.900
[Guest]: they have kept it for that purpose. This equipment is not at all for that purpose. In fact, if

02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:07.540
[Guest]: you leave it there, their building probably will blow up in a little while.

02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:08.540
[Guest]: For example?

02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:15.540
[Guest]: A liquid oxygen tank in your basement, right? Okay, I'm not going to say who has, but there

02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:23.140
[Guest]: are people who bought a liquid oxygen tank. I think they were not ill-meaning or stupid

02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:30.220
[Guest]: or anything like that. Somebody somewhere is telling you this can provide value. And

02:06:30.220 --> 02:06:34.580
[Guest]: even if that is true, actually, look at it the other side. Let's say that it is true

02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:40.740
[Guest]: that there is a way to safely keep a liquid oxygen tank in your basement and give yourself

02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:46.940
[Guest]: some capacity for oxygen if necessary. Even if that were true, I'm willing to bet that

02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:53.300
[Guest]: the procedure for keeping a liquid oxygen tank in your basement does not exist. Frankly,

02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:57.500
[Guest]: there's no procedure for saying I'm going to keep this in my basement. And certainly

02:06:57.500 --> 02:07:04.860
[Guest]: the health department has not, quote unquote, sanctioned this. But you know it's happening.

02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:08.620
[Guest]: And you know people are handling certain equipment who have not been certified to handle that

02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:14.340
[Guest]: equipment. You know that, right? But there's nobody else to handle that equipment. So should

02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:18.740
[Guest]: you stop it? Should you say, well, I'm not going to give you, should you give equipment

02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:24.940
[Guest]: to people who have had no certification at all to handle that equipment? That's a real

02:07:24.940 --> 02:07:29.340
[Guest]: choice, right? Because you don't know the number of people, the number of people who

02:07:29.340 --> 02:07:33.060
[Guest]: are certified to use that equipment is vastly smaller than the number of people needed to

02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:36.620
[Guest]: handle the equipment today. So should you be buying and giving equipment to people who

02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:42.540
[Guest]: have no certification to handle it? If the answer is yes, you can't fight the pandemic.

02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:46.700
[Guest]: I'm giving you a sense of the kind of choices that you're making, that you're having to

02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:52.980
[Guest]: make. The other thing is some districts have greater capacity than other districts. So

02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:57.140
[Guest]: this is an interesting question in the whole spectrum. Should you do things where you have

02:07:57.140 --> 02:08:03.140
[Guest]: the capacity to do them well? Or should you do things where the need is the greatest?

02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:08.500
[Guest]: Because these are very different geographies, actually. And if you do it where you have

02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:15.740
[Guest]: the capacity to do them well, typically you end up worsening an already bad historical

02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:20.220
[Guest]: deficit of infrastructure in some parts of the state or some parts of the country. So

02:08:20.220 --> 02:08:26.680
[Guest]: everybody knows, for example, that Northeast Karnataka has had certain deficits of infrastructure.

02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:30.300
[Guest]: So that makes it harder to do some things in that thing. So you can say, well, what's

02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:35.460
[Guest]: the point? There isn't enough capacity to roll this out over here. But that's also the

02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:42.660
[Guest]: point that the need is greatest over there. So you have to make those choices. And sometimes

02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:50.660
[Guest]: the administrators will tell you, sir, you are arranging the donation. You decide. And

02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:57.100
[Guest]: you're thinking neither I nor the donor nor the manufacturer wants to decide this. The

02:08:57.100 --> 02:09:02.820
[Guest]: public authority to do these things should actually decide. But the public authority

02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:09.260
[Guest]: is telling you, you decide. Because the public authority has its own challenges in coming

02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:14.140
[Guest]: to the right decision. I mean, like I said, I don't want to keep getting into the nitty

02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:21.800
[Guest]: gritty of this too much because there are these kinds of realities that can go on endlessly.

02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:28.460
[Guest]: So in one case, for example, we bought some equipment without some regulator that is needed

02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:33.460
[Guest]: to run that damn equipment. Unfortunately, the procurement process from the donor to

02:09:33.460 --> 02:09:39.900
[Guest]: buy that thing exhausted the money that was available to buy the thing. The guy on the

02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:44.380
[Guest]: truck, the guy who's doing the dispatch says, parva nahi sir, main isi ko bhi isi way bil

02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:48.700
[Guest]: mein a tax karke, I will send it to you. And you can say, well, I don't want to do that.

02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:52.460
[Guest]: Like we'll raise a new invoice, we'll create the proper record, you create a way bill for

02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:56.300
[Guest]: that thing, and then we'll deal with all of these kinds of things. Another set of people

02:09:56.300 --> 02:10:00.340
[Guest]: are the guys who need that are saying, why are you mad? This thing is coming, put it

02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:04.700
[Guest]: on this thing, get it over here. And then there's another set of people, like one guy

02:10:04.700 --> 02:10:09.540
[Guest]: called me and said, sir, you know, people like you, you have the network to be able

02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:17.180
[Guest]: to sort of surround yourself with six other people to make these decisions. I'm an accountant

02:10:17.180 --> 02:10:23.660
[Guest]: in this processing entity. Six months from now, eight months from now, when people start

02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:28.780
[Guest]: to ask questions about how this happened and how that happened, it's very likely that a

02:10:28.780 --> 02:10:32.980
[Guest]: very large number of the people who are here representing the need today are not going

02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:38.740
[Guest]: to be there at that time. Right? And you have to sometimes tell accountants to spend, I

02:10:38.740 --> 02:10:45.340
[Guest]: have told accountants to spend money that they do not have. Okay, I'm giving you that

02:10:45.340 --> 02:10:51.940
[Guest]: I know that in their organizations, sort of reserves against the ledger that we have created,

02:10:51.940 --> 02:10:56.060
[Guest]: there isn't enough money to actually execute the transaction. But I have told them you

02:10:56.060 --> 02:11:01.300
[Guest]: do it. The guy will say, how can I do that? There isn't enough inflow for you. He's not

02:11:01.300 --> 02:11:06.660
[Guest]: just making a technical point. So I tell him, okay, the inflow will be there, just do it.

02:11:06.660 --> 02:11:11.580
[Guest]: You juggle money from somebody else's account in your own organization, use it for now,

02:11:11.580 --> 02:11:18.380
[Guest]: we will put it back. He says, I have no authority from my boss to do that. I said, yeah, but

02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:24.900
[Guest]: there are two kinds of authority. Right? You first decide whether this is true, whether

02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:29.300
[Guest]: this can be pulled off, whether more money can be raised to cover the thing for a little

02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:33.780
[Guest]: while. And if the answer to that is yes, you have to first decide whether you feel comfortable

02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:37.660
[Guest]: doing that. Whether your boss feels comfortable, we'll come to that. Whether your boss is given

02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:42.020
[Guest]: the authority, we'll come to that. But first, do you feel comfortable doing that based on

02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:47.980
[Guest]: what you know about the cash flow itself? It just goes on and on and on.

02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:52.740
[Amit Varma]: I want to sort of continue on the data line, but on a separate this thing where, what is

02:11:52.740 --> 02:11:58.100
[Amit Varma]: the flow of discovery where you figure out what actual needs are, and the nuances of

02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:03.820
[Amit Varma]: those needs, so that you can fulfill them, for example, or at the very basic level, you

02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:08.100
[Amit Varma]: might know that these people need oxygen. And therefore, you're the obvious solution

02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:12.500
[Amit Varma]: for a donor will be by oxygen plants. But then the question is that you have oxygen

02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:16.580
[Amit Varma]: plants, how do you set them up? What are the processes? Then the question and I read that

02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:20.860
[Amit Varma]: this is a problem somewhere that there is actually excess oxygen in some places, but

02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:25.540
[Amit Varma]: the scarcity is of cylinders. And why are cylinders not being manufactured because of

02:12:25.540 --> 02:12:30.540
[Amit Varma]: people who manufacture the cylinders are not being able to run the factories because the

02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:35.140
[Amit Varma]: government has said oxygen is only for medical use. It's not for manufacturing this stuff.

02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:39.760
[Amit Varma]: And it goes round and round. Now, my thing is that therefore, there is a danger that

02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:45.380
[Amit Varma]: in this process, there is a lot of wastage in terms of effort and resources. One is there

02:12:45.380 --> 02:12:51.860
[Amit Varma]: a way of codifying this developing knowledge as it, you know, forms so that you are able

02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:58.400
[Amit Varma]: to direct resources more and more sharply and more and more usefully as time goes by.

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:03.340
[Amit Varma]: And is there then on the part of some donors or some people who are in this, just the desire

02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:08.820
[Amit Varma]: to do something because they want to do something. And solving the problem actually requires

02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:14.140
[Amit Varma]: a kind of a deeper application in this sense of kind of give me a sense of the practical

02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:19.180
[Amit Varma]: flow of discovery. If you have any example to share where you go down one rabbit hole

02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:23.580
[Amit Varma]: and all these nuances crop up, that would be great and sort of understanding at a practical

02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:29.540
[Guest]: level what it involves. So, I have a sheet of requirements from every

02:13:29.540 --> 02:13:36.140
[Guest]: district from the government officially. So, this is what is needed. In some cases, it

02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:41.420
[Guest]: has come from the secretariat inside the government. In some cases, it comes from directly from

02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:44.460
[Amit Varma]: the district. You are saying Karnataka or India?

02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:49.860
[Guest]: Karnataka. Karnataka for now. We have this from some other districts as well outside

02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:56.780
[Guest]: Karnataka as well. But inside Karnataka, we have this for every district, right? And also

02:13:56.780 --> 02:14:03.780
[Guest]: there is a system of continuous contact with the leadership of the response effort in Karnataka,

02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:08.500
[Guest]: the senior secretaries who are in charge of various things. You have to keep in touch

02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:13.140
[Guest]: with them all the time and let them guide you a little bit about what they are hearing

02:14:13.140 --> 02:14:19.460
[Guest]: in their system, right? But that cannot be the only source of information because that

02:14:19.460 --> 02:14:26.340
[Guest]: hearing channel itself has its own deficits. So, what you do is you also create other channels

02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:31.620
[Guest]: of information from your external sources and you also feed that back into the government

02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:38.680
[Guest]: to say now you are in effect a floating system of information providers to the government.

02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:42.260
[Guest]: And sometimes those sheets of paper that the government generates may even be benefited

02:14:42.260 --> 02:14:46.420
[Guest]: by the information that you have given because you actually know the thing that needs to

02:14:46.420 --> 02:14:52.340
[Guest]: be done. Many people on the ground in the administrative space do not know what is actually

02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:56.620
[Guest]: needed in each of the facilities. You actually need somebody who has done hospital administration

02:14:56.620 --> 02:15:00.940
[Guest]: to crack that. But in many of the smaller places, no, there isn't anybody to make this

02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:07.020
[Guest]: assessment at all. So, there are three pieces of it. One is the official record that comes

02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:12.180
[Guest]: out. You try to influence the official record by giving it input about what you are seeing

02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:17.660
[Guest]: on the ground so that it improves. The second is there are certain things that anyway nothing

02:15:17.660 --> 02:15:23.860
[Guest]: is being delivered only by the official machinery. Whether you want oxygen cylinders or concentrators

02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:29.100
[Guest]: or ventilators or ICU beds or whatever, we do not have a situation where all of this

02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:32.460
[Guest]: is being delivered only by the government. Some of it is being delivered by the government,

02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:36.620
[Guest]: some of it is delivered by the private sector. Some ad hoc arrangements are going on for

02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:41.020
[Guest]: all of that stuff. So, effectively, you are running a parallel channel. In fact, if you

02:15:41.020 --> 02:15:46.380
[Guest]: are smart, you should tell the government what you propose to do. And if you tell the

02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:49.140
[Guest]: government what you propose to do, they can write that down and say, okay, this piece

02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:53.260
[Guest]: will be done by so-and-so, that piece will be done by so-and-so. And they can sort of

02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:59.860
[Guest]: factor all of that into it. So, it is absolutely essential number one to have continuous contact

02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:05.980
[Guest]: with the government to do this kind of thing. Second, you have to look for complementarity.

02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:12.660
[Guest]: That is, some devices only work if one or two other things are also there in that person.

02:16:12.660 --> 02:16:18.420
[Guest]: But the needs documents are not always written up in that way. The needs document also in

02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:22.980
[Guest]: some cases, I haven't seen this much in Karnataka, but I've seen this elsewhere. The needs document

02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:28.540
[Guest]: will tell you what they want. They don't tell you what they have. And if they don't tell

02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:33.420
[Guest]: you what they have, you have no way of knowing whether the thing that they want is going

02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:38.180
[Guest]: to work because it needs one more thing. And that thing is not on this list. So, you don't

02:16:38.180 --> 02:16:41.740
[Guest]: know whether you should add that to that list or not. So, what you do, this is where that

02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:45.700
[Guest]: verifiable needs thing comes in. You call the guy and say, I noticed that your list

02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:51.220
[Guest]: has A, B, and C, but A will not work without D. Do you have D? So, you have to convert

02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:56.220
[Guest]: need into verifiable need. And you have to do that whether you are the government or

02:16:56.220 --> 02:17:00.180
[Guest]: whether you are the outside channel kind of thing. So, what you try to do again and again

02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:04.900
[Guest]: and again is convert need into verifiable need and keep complete transparency between

02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:09.140
[Guest]: what you know and what you are letting the government know because that's the best chance

02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:10.140
[Guest]: of doing this.

02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:14.940
[Guest]: There's another kind of problem. Some donors will say, we want a request letter from the

02:17:14.940 --> 02:17:21.980
[Guest]: government. I don't mind saying this, but you can say to the government, please sign

02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:29.380
[Guest]: this letter. And the government also, I am sure is getting dozens of such letters, not

02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:33.700
[Guest]: just from the donors that are known to me, but many others that are known to me because

02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:40.420
[Guest]: everybody wants to do CYA, right? I did this because the government asked me to do it.

02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:47.420
[Guest]: It's not that I did it without any sanction for doing it. But one, the process of getting

02:17:47.420 --> 02:17:52.100
[Guest]: that letter itself slows down the thing. In some places, you have really good connects,

02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:57.180
[Guest]: you can do it fast. But in a very large number of cases, you can't even do that quickly.

02:17:57.180 --> 02:18:03.700
[Guest]: The second thing is, in many cases, even if they gave you that letter, they don't actually

02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:09.380
[Guest]: know that what they're saying in that letter is true. They're also going on faith, right?

02:18:09.380 --> 02:18:15.580
[Guest]: So now you have to craft the language of that letter so that it includes some ambiguity.

02:18:15.580 --> 02:18:23.020
[Guest]: The third thing is, it's kind of odd and I've seen this in some cases, where you need something

02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:31.580
[Guest]: from me, okay? I come to you and say, here, take it. But for a variety of reasons, on

02:18:31.580 --> 02:18:39.740
[Guest]: the official record, you cannot say, I need this. Instead, you say, well, I'm doing whatever

02:18:39.740 --> 02:18:45.060
[Guest]: I can at full tilt to make all the things possible that I can, but we recognize that

02:18:45.060 --> 02:18:53.060
[Guest]: this is inadequate. We would therefore be willing to accept support from you, okay?

02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:58.380
[Guest]: This is what the letter will say in the end, right? And the donor will come back and say,

02:18:58.380 --> 02:19:05.260
[Guest]: yeh kya utha hai? Right? And so you have to talk to the donor and say, what is your problem?

02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:11.380
[Guest]: Just that's the line number three, shut the fuck up and do it, right? You have to say

02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:16.060
[Guest]: that six times a day, I'm telling you, and I've not even told you the worst of it. There

02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:20.340
[Guest]: are things I can't tell you. That's just life. You have to tell people again and again and

02:19:20.340 --> 02:19:27.300
[Guest]: again, just do it, yeah? Right? Don't ask so many questions. And of course, I recognize

02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:33.620
[Guest]: the questions that you are asking add health. But you have the luxury of discounting the

02:19:33.620 --> 02:19:38.940
[Guest]: fact that people are dying. And the reason you have that luxury is that you are not standing

02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:42.740
[Guest]: on this side of that problem. If you're standing on this side of the problem, even you would

02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:46.820
[Guest]: sign it, I know that. But if you're going to stand on that side of the problem, at least

02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:51.500
[Guest]: do the thing that you can, as fast as the guys want you to do it on this side of the

02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:55.180
[Guest]: problem, whether it's coming from government or not, whether it's coming from the private

02:19:55.180 --> 02:19:58.740
[Guest]: sector or whether it's the gray areas or not.

02:19:58.740 --> 02:20:06.420
[Guest]: If you cannot act fast enough to enable the relief effort to go really quickly, you simply

02:20:06.420 --> 02:20:12.300
[Guest]: cannot be adding value. And a lot of people in institutional spaces especially simply

02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:17.340
[Guest]: don't get that. Or they get it and they say, yeah, but what, six months from now you won't

02:20:17.340 --> 02:20:21.620
[Guest]: be around and people will be asking me questions in my organization. Well, that's true, but

02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:24.980
[Guest]: that's your moral choice. Imagine I'm having the moral choice of deciding who lives and

02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:28.660
[Guest]: who dies. And you're saying that you don't want to deal with the choice of having to

02:20:28.660 --> 02:20:33.020
[Guest]: explain to your boss why you spent money without the right authorization.

02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:36.660
[Guest]: And so you have to sort of educate the guy that, come on, if some other one set of people

02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:42.460
[Guest]: are taking risks that are far greater than this, why can't you take three risks like

02:20:42.460 --> 02:20:49.380
[Guest]: this? Some will, very few will. That's the sad part. Very few will.

02:20:49.380 --> 02:20:53.300
[Amit Varma]: So to whatever extent you can, tell me a little bit about the kind of relief work you guys

02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:58.380
[Amit Varma]: have been doing. Like one thing I noticed randomly on Twitter was where you were getting

02:20:58.380 --> 02:21:03.180
[Amit Varma]: oxygen cylinders supplied to someplace in Karnataka and Ruben in Bombay had managed

02:21:03.180 --> 02:21:07.020
[Amit Varma]: to organize for that. And when the trucks were flagged off, he tweeted the photographs

02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:10.860
[Amit Varma]: and you know that this is going from this place to that place. And I assume that that's

02:21:10.860 --> 02:21:16.220
[Amit Varma]: just one minor detail among the things that you do. So to whatever extent you can without

02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:20.780
[Amit Varma]: giving any details that you don't want to give, tell me about the kind of things that

02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:25.780
[Amit Varma]: you did and also tell me about how that fructified. Like I suppose at this moment, let's say you

02:21:25.780 --> 02:21:30.980
[Amit Varma]: do X, Y, Z, but you know, when you get into relief, it's a bouquet of options you can

02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:35.500
[Amit Varma]: do anywhere from A to Z, but eventually you narrow down to X, Y, Z, and you say that these

02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:40.420
[Amit Varma]: are the places where we are most useful because obviously there are resources of time, attention,

02:21:40.420 --> 02:21:43.900
[Amit Varma]: money, all of those things. So it'd be great if you can give me some insight.

02:21:43.900 --> 02:21:48.900
[Guest]: There's also geography. You're sourcing the resource from a certain direction.

02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:50.580
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:21:50.580 --> 02:21:55.900
[Guest]: Okay, so you can get it to places that are closer to that direction. So if you're sourcing

02:21:55.900 --> 02:21:58.860
[Guest]: it from Maharashtra, you can get it into North Karnataka faster. If you're sourcing it from

02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:04.300
[Guest]: Tamil Nadu, you can get it into South Karnataka faster. There's that also, which is a limit.

02:22:04.300 --> 02:22:10.940
[Guest]: So in the case of the stuff that happened with, you know, this, that Ruben did, so we

02:22:10.940 --> 02:22:16.900
[Guest]: couldn't really find the guy, I mean, who said he could make these cylinders. And so

02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:22.700
[Guest]: what Ruben did is sort of, it's a useful kind of example, right? So you're trying to buy

02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:29.740
[Guest]: something. Some guy says he can sell it, right? So you have no idea whether he can sell it

02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:34.780
[Guest]: or not, whether he's even legit or not. So the first thing you have to do is like, okay,

02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:38.860
[Guest]: talk to the guy on the phone, try to see what he tells you and all that. Then you say, okay,

02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:43.580
[Guest]: I have some sense of it. Then you say, okay, I'm going to go there and take a look because

02:22:43.580 --> 02:22:49.300
[Guest]: that's the only way to be sure. Then Ruben went to see one guy, right? Like that. The

02:22:49.300 --> 02:22:54.020
[Guest]: place he went to see him was somewhere in the middle of Dharavi, right? And Ruben's

02:22:54.020 --> 02:22:58.860
[Guest]: thinking, even if the guy's here, I hope the facility where he's making the damn things

02:22:58.860 --> 02:23:04.180
[Guest]: isn't here in some way, because this requires a proper setup to make all of these kinds

02:23:04.180 --> 02:23:08.380
[Guest]: of things. You're making, you know, concentrators, oxygen cylinders, things that don't really

02:23:08.380 --> 02:23:15.020
[Guest]: get put together in, it's not like making shirts in your house for the textile industry.

02:23:15.020 --> 02:23:19.220
[Guest]: So he goes there, and then obviously he can't find the place. There's so many by-lanes and

02:23:19.220 --> 02:23:23.300
[Guest]: lanes inside the place that he's like totally, and Ruben actually knows those places well,

02:23:23.300 --> 02:23:28.220
[Guest]: right? He can't find the place, imagine. And then he goes and says, okay, I'll get a cop.

02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:31.060
[Guest]: And there's also a little bit of a concern. You're just kind of going around looking for

02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:34.620
[Guest]: some random guy. You're not from there. So he took one cop and he went inside and he

02:23:34.620 --> 02:23:39.180
[Guest]: goes, somehow he dug out the guy, right? And that guy's, you know, he just went all this

02:23:39.180 --> 02:23:43.340
[Guest]: turn left here, turn right there and finally found the guy. Then it turns out that guy's

02:23:43.340 --> 02:23:49.140
[Guest]: facility is in Navi Mumbai. Then we say, okay, what we came to check was not you. We came

02:23:49.140 --> 02:23:53.260
[Guest]: to check whether you could actually make the damn thing. So now we are going to Navi Mumbai.

02:23:53.260 --> 02:24:00.300
[Guest]: And the guy will say, you see the grey areas, right? So in some way you have to say, I want

02:24:00.300 --> 02:24:04.700
[Guest]: to see this thing. This is the only way to get it done quickly. Just do the damn thing

02:24:04.700 --> 02:24:09.620
[Guest]: quickly. People are helping. You also very well help. And then you go there, he has a

02:24:09.620 --> 02:24:14.460
[Guest]: nice facility, he's got some seven things done and all of that. So you sort of work

02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:19.140
[Guest]: with that process and get good. But he's not done this in scale. He's never needed to do

02:24:19.140 --> 02:24:26.620
[Guest]: this in scale. And his sourcing for actually doing this is weak. So you've got to find

02:24:26.620 --> 02:24:31.220
[Guest]: out who are all the guys who are part of his sourcing. And you've got to figure out whether

02:24:31.220 --> 02:24:35.700
[Guest]: you can do something to enable that sourcing to work properly. Three of those guys will

02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:41.780
[Guest]: demand something. So many guys will say, I want to under-invoice you. Lots of guys have

02:24:41.780 --> 02:24:46.060
[Guest]: said, I want to under-invoice you. Because there are lots of problems out there. The

02:24:46.060 --> 02:24:51.780
[Guest]: government put a cap on some things. You know, the cap, the price cap on some things. So

02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:56.100
[Guest]: some people get worried. They say, well, you know what, I want to under-invoice you because

02:24:56.100 --> 02:25:01.540
[Guest]: there's a price cap on this thing. But in the market, there are only two choices. The

02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:06.380
[Guest]: price caps have actually created a problem. The price cap creates a situation in which

02:25:06.380 --> 02:25:12.340
[Guest]: the seller says, I have to either under-invoice you and you pay the rest in cash or bugger

02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:18.500
[Guest]: off. I don't even want to sell to you. So your choices are not getting it or getting

02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:25.940
[Guest]: into a legal tangle. You have to resolve that choice if you want the thing, right? There

02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:31.420
[Guest]: is no easy way to resolve that choice, right? He will say, okay, sir, I do this, I do that,

02:25:31.420 --> 02:25:36.260
[Guest]: some nonsense, he will say and do something. And then you have to say to the government,

02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:41.340
[Guest]: please remove this price cap or shift the effective date for this price cap. The states

02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:45.740
[Guest]: in the center have very different positions on some of these kinds of things. It's all

02:25:45.740 --> 02:25:53.500
[Guest]: one big mess out there. And because policy is a mess, action can never be, there are

02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:59.940
[Guest]: contradictory policies out there. There is simply no way to follow all the policies.

02:25:59.940 --> 02:26:01.980
[Guest]: Give me an example.

02:26:01.980 --> 02:26:10.380
[Guest]: Like they will say only such and such a person can do this, right? In the manufacturing,

02:26:10.380 --> 02:26:19.220
[Guest]: like oxygen. So only such and such a person can import something. That person will have

02:26:19.220 --> 02:26:25.900
[Guest]: already imported it. After he's imported it, they will say only such and such a person

02:26:25.900 --> 02:26:33.260
[Guest]: can transport it. But the guy who has sort of imported it doesn't have that actual relationship.

02:26:33.260 --> 02:26:38.060
[Guest]: He's just using his import-export license to carry out an activity that he has never

02:26:38.060 --> 02:26:44.020
[Guest]: previously carried out, right? So somehow you have to figure out how to transfer the

02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:49.940
[Guest]: responsibility for the movement of the thing inside the country to a guy who is not the

02:26:49.940 --> 02:26:55.540
[Guest]: guy who imported it into the country. There's lots of paperwork. It can be done, but there's

02:26:55.540 --> 02:27:00.700
[Guest]: lots of paperwork and it'll take time, right? But the thing is needed now. If you are going

02:27:00.700 --> 02:27:05.060
[Guest]: to do it after seven days, what's the point? The thing is needed now. And sometimes you

02:27:05.060 --> 02:27:11.180
[Guest]: have various, you know, the superintendent of police will say, we need this now, right?

02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:16.820
[Guest]: He has to take that call as to whether to use it now or wait for the paperwork. So what

02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:22.220
[Guest]: you do is you keep the administration informed. This has to be done, right? It has been done

02:27:22.220 --> 02:27:25.460
[Guest]: with your knowledge. You even document that it has been done with their knowledge, but

02:27:25.460 --> 02:27:33.500
[Guest]: you do it. So what I would say is there is no good way to tackle the pandemic because

02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:41.300
[Guest]: many things that are needed to tackle the pandemic are not possible to do under the

02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:48.460
[Guest]: current legal framework at all. And until there is a more liberal framework that says,

02:27:48.460 --> 02:27:52.780
[Guest]: and you know what will happen under emergency provisions, this framework doesn't actually

02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:58.380
[Guest]: become more liberal. It becomes more, you know what I mean, centralized.

02:27:58.380 --> 02:28:00.380
[Guest]: More restrictions, more rules.

02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:08.660
[Guest]: So yeah, the emergency should mean you can do more things that were not previously possible.

02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:14.220
[Guest]: But in an emergency, you'll actually say, we are not going to allow seven other things.

02:28:14.220 --> 02:28:20.820
[Guest]: We are going to allow only three things that we think are necessary to solve the problem.

02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:25.980
[Guest]: But if those three things do not form a complete set of what is needed to solve the problem,

02:28:25.980 --> 02:28:30.380
[Guest]: and a fourth thing is needed, because of the emergency power, you can't solve the problem

02:28:30.380 --> 02:28:35.500
[Guest]: until you sort of do the fourth thing anyway, whether there is a legal provision for it

02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:39.540
[Guest]: or not. So a lot of people are dealing with that dilemma. There are not enough provisions

02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:44.780
[Guest]: in law that understand the situation on the ground and enable it.

02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:49.820
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, this is worth pointing out because this, to a large extent, is dead by bureaucracy

02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:53.980
[Amit Varma]: because every delay literally costs you lives. And the point is that you see the consequences

02:28:53.980 --> 02:28:59.860
[Amit Varma]: now starkly, where you can say that, okay, this law conflicts with this law, or this

02:28:59.860 --> 02:29:03.940
[Amit Varma]: particular law doesn't allow this action to be taken, and therefore lives will be lost.

02:29:03.940 --> 02:29:08.860
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, this whole framework of, you know, the center controlling everything

02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:14.340
[Amit Varma]: and all this red tapism and rent seeking has been with us for over 70 years and has hobbled

02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:19.440
[Amit Varma]: the nation. In fact, I would argue has probably cost many multiples of lives and COVID can

02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:24.020
[Amit Varma]: happen in all kinds of unseen ways in a slow drip, drip, drip kind of way where you are

02:29:24.020 --> 02:29:29.620
[Amit Varma]: just not letting society solve its own problems. I keep saying that COVID-19 has made the dysfunctional

02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:34.380
[Amit Varma]: state stark. Earlier we were in denial of it. It's shown us how dysfunctional it is

02:29:34.380 --> 02:29:39.100
[Amit Varma]: in a similar sense. It's shown us how evil this kind of bureaucracy is. You know that

02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:43.900
[Amit Varma]: of course it is resulting in lives lost now. But the costs have been immense anyway over

02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:49.620
[Amit Varma]: the last seven and a half decades, and no one's done anything about it. But I'm sorry,

02:29:49.620 --> 02:29:54.780
[Amit Varma]: so that that rant aside, what would you say are, you know, during this period in sort

02:29:54.780 --> 02:29:58.860
[Amit Varma]: of the things that you've done in the areas that you worked in? What are kind of your

02:29:58.860 --> 02:30:04.020
[Amit Varma]: big learnings? Like, if you were to speak to the Ashwin Mahesh of say, before the second

02:30:04.020 --> 02:30:08.500
[Amit Varma]: wave began, maybe the Ashwin Mahesh of February, what quick learnings would you give him so

02:30:08.500 --> 02:30:11.500
[Amit Varma]: that he doesn't have to learn them the hard way?

02:30:11.500 --> 02:30:18.620
[Guest]: I think we should have put together the capacity to keep ourselves informed earlier. And we

02:30:18.620 --> 02:30:22.860
[Guest]: should have put together that capacity to keep informed, not only in the government,

02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:26.980
[Guest]: but outside the government, which is really the thing that is finally starting to happen.

02:30:26.980 --> 02:30:32.900
[Guest]: I think as long as the government is the only one that knows something, it's not really

02:30:32.900 --> 02:30:40.540
[Guest]: known. You know, for something to be known in a meaningful way, it has to be known across

02:30:40.540 --> 02:30:46.540
[Guest]: state market and society. If it is known only to one of them, it's not a useful way of knowing

02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:52.220
[Guest]: anything to tackle a problem. But if you look at government policy, government policy is

02:30:52.220 --> 02:30:57.420
[Guest]: based on the idea that it's better for the people to be terrified in ignorance than for

02:30:57.420 --> 02:31:02.580
[Guest]: them to be terrified in an informed way. Right? So there's this thing called the Communicable

02:31:02.580 --> 02:31:07.780
[Guest]: Diseases Act. I don't know if you know that. The Communicable Diseases Act sort of has

02:31:07.780 --> 02:31:11.980
[Guest]: certain provisions, which, you know, if you properly implement them, if you go to a hospital

02:31:11.980 --> 02:31:15.940
[Guest]: and say, check me out for dengue, check me out for chikungunya, and all of that stuff,

02:31:15.940 --> 02:31:23.620
[Guest]: they'll say, haan tk, we'll figure it out and go home. Right? And they're not, the hospital

02:31:23.620 --> 02:31:27.900
[Guest]: that actually knows that you have dengue or chikungunya is not in a position to tell you

02:31:27.900 --> 02:31:32.860
[Guest]: that. I'm giving you an example, this particular provision, I'm giving you an example from

02:31:32.860 --> 02:31:37.500
[Guest]: some two, three years ago, certainly. So there is one National Institute of Virology, only

02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:43.980
[Guest]: this National Institute of Virology can tell whether something is reliably true. And conceptually

02:31:43.980 --> 02:31:48.180
[Guest]: there's nothing wrong with that. You want these things to be done by somebody who has

02:31:48.180 --> 02:31:53.180
[Guest]: the actual capability to do that. But all of these things were set up at a time when

02:31:53.180 --> 02:31:59.980
[Guest]: state capacity was much higher than private capacity. 1950s, 1960s, whatever. But today

02:31:59.980 --> 02:32:04.180
[Guest]: state capacity is nowhere near private capacity. So what ends up happening, the guy in the

02:32:04.180 --> 02:32:09.620
[Guest]: hospital will tell you, you have chikungunya, okay, and therefore you should be doing A,

02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:14.820
[Guest]: B, C, D, E, but I didn't tell you that. Wait for your report. So there's a lot of stuff

02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:21.580
[Guest]: that is told orally, which is very different from what is told on paper. Now there are

02:32:21.580 --> 02:32:27.380
[Guest]: two kinds of problems. One is that you start to do stuff before you got that official thing,

02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:32.260
[Guest]: which you really should not have known. So all the doctors and the pharmacists who cooperate

02:32:32.260 --> 02:32:37.580
[Guest]: with you in doing that stuff are actually breaking the law. But if you want to be cured,

02:32:37.580 --> 02:32:42.700
[Guest]: that's the only way to do it, right? Now there's another kind of problem. The Institute of

02:32:42.700 --> 02:32:48.020
[Guest]: Virology might come back and say you don't have chikungunya. And meanwhile for three

02:32:48.020 --> 02:32:52.380
[Guest]: days you've been taking chikungunya medicine, whatever that medicine is, right? So you've

02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:58.780
[Guest]: got another kind of moral paradox, right? If you tell the guy, he has a chance of getting

02:32:58.780 --> 02:33:03.340
[Guest]: better. But even as you tell the guy, you have no way of knowing that the thing that

02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:09.380
[Guest]: you are telling the guy is what the official paperwork is going to say even later. So what's

02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:16.220
[Guest]: the solution? There's no solution. That's all it is. It is a set of rules for which

02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:19.740
[Guest]: there is no solution because they contradict each other.

02:33:19.740 --> 02:33:25.780
[Amit Varma]: Okay, I can't, this is causing severe dissonance. I can't kind of wrap my head around this.

02:33:25.780 --> 02:33:29.820
[Amit Varma]: So tell me, part of it, of course, is that you coordinate with donors, you coordinate

02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:34.700
[Amit Varma]: with volunteers, you get all of it together. But a significant part of it is coordinating

02:33:34.700 --> 02:33:40.620
[Amit Varma]: with the state. Sometimes it's understanding what their needs are. And sometimes it is

02:33:40.620 --> 02:33:45.620
[Amit Varma]: kind of getting these workarounds. So now, one, this interface with government, how does

02:33:45.620 --> 02:33:50.220
[Amit Varma]: it work in the short term? Does it become more responsive and so on? And two, is there

02:33:50.220 --> 02:33:54.740
[Amit Varma]: a chance through this of solving any of the longer term structural problems? Because that

02:33:54.740 --> 02:33:57.420
[Amit Varma]: broader disaster is still with us, right?

02:33:57.420 --> 02:34:03.460
[Guest]: Yes, there is. Look, I think one good thing that has happened in many state governments

02:34:03.460 --> 02:34:11.820
[Guest]: is that because of the scale of the problem, they have moved fairly competent people into

02:34:11.820 --> 02:34:17.700
[Guest]: the particular parts of government that deal with this problem. You understand, you can't

02:34:17.700 --> 02:34:23.420
[Guest]: take the guy who was underperforming for the last 20 years in his career anyway, and give

02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:28.460
[Guest]: him any job in this chain of command, because then that's it. That's pretty much, he is

02:34:28.460 --> 02:34:33.260
[Guest]: the pandemic at that point, right? So you can't do that. So most governments have figured

02:34:33.260 --> 02:34:39.180
[Guest]: out, if I do that, then these things are going to blow up in my face anyway. So I might as

02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:44.140
[Guest]: well start to put people in the chain of command who I know at least will do the job with a

02:34:44.140 --> 02:34:49.660
[Guest]: fair amount of integrity and a fair amount of industriousness about just moving on the

02:34:49.660 --> 02:34:50.660
[Guest]: thing.

02:34:50.660 --> 02:34:55.260
[Guest]: And that's one of the good things, that the health departments throughout the country

02:34:55.260 --> 02:35:03.380
[Guest]: have reasonably responded to the whole thing by migrating their officials, the stronger

02:35:03.380 --> 02:35:10.500
[Guest]: officials to the health-related focus. That's one part of it. But I don't know if you can

02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:15.340
[Guest]: count on that to be permanent, because it's quite likely that they form only a one-third

02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:20.460
[Guest]: subset of the total thing. Many of these people are in transferable jobs anyway. So at some

02:35:20.460 --> 02:35:22.660
[Guest]: point that could dissipate again.

02:35:22.660 --> 02:35:26.500
[Guest]: Somebody told me a couple of days ago, the government does not successively appoint good

02:35:26.500 --> 02:35:31.940
[Guest]: officers to the same position, right? So basically, at the very least, if someone is good now,

02:35:31.940 --> 02:35:36.300
[Guest]: you can sort of reasonably be sure the next person is not going to be asked. I don't know.

02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:40.380
[Guest]: All that is statistical at some level. But what I'm trying to say is the government interface

02:35:40.380 --> 02:35:47.420
[Guest]: works like this. You have to help. They have to believe that you are there only to help

02:35:47.420 --> 02:35:53.660
[Guest]: and that there is no other reason that you are there. And that you have to help them

02:35:53.660 --> 02:36:04.500
[Guest]: in a way that works with their system. Even if their system is not the way you would like

02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:09.820
[Guest]: to help, or even if you believe that this is not the way to help, you have to at least

02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:17.300
[Guest]: help them make it work inside their system in a way that this is the way that it is being

02:36:17.300 --> 02:36:18.300
[Guest]: organized.

02:36:18.300 --> 02:36:24.980
[Guest]: Because if you don't do that, so for example, let's say you want to represent something

02:36:24.980 --> 02:36:30.420
[Guest]: to the government of Kerala, just to pick one random state, and say, I would like this.

02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:36.580
[Guest]: Even if a private person who is playing a supporting role with the government of Kerala

02:36:36.580 --> 02:36:41.220
[Guest]: were to go to the government and say, okay, this is a good thing, you should do it, you

02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:45.700
[Guest]: should help, let Amit do this kind of thing, that government will come back and say, okay,

02:36:45.700 --> 02:36:50.500
[Guest]: based on the authority or the influence that guy has, the government will say yes, not

02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:55.060
[Guest]: because anything that you say is convincing enough to, they have no capacity to figure

02:36:55.060 --> 02:36:56.940
[Guest]: that out in the short run anyway.

02:36:56.940 --> 02:37:02.780
[Guest]: So somebody is saying sign here, right? So the government of any state has to sign because

02:37:02.780 --> 02:37:06.220
[Guest]: somebody is saying sign here, number one, and not because anything that is said on that

02:37:06.220 --> 02:37:12.060
[Guest]: piece of paper is true. But more importantly, they also need to be able to represent that

02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:17.140
[Guest]: with sufficient ambiguity. So they recraft the language of what you are asking in a way

02:37:17.140 --> 02:37:23.700
[Guest]: that makes it look like, Amit, you're being allowed to help me, right? There are health

02:37:23.700 --> 02:37:29.940
[Guest]: secretaries around the country who have told me, okay, okay, you can go ahead. And it's

02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:35.420
[Guest]: at the tip of my tongue to say, what do you mean you can go ahead? I'm trying to help

02:37:35.420 --> 02:37:42.580
[Guest]: you, right? And all your body language says you are giving me permission. If it was not

02:37:42.580 --> 02:37:47.140
[Guest]: for the fact that behind you, there are millions of people who actually need this help, I would

02:37:47.140 --> 02:37:51.380
[Guest]: have told you to just get lost and say there are enough people that want my help and will

02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:53.140
[Guest]: take it with grace.

02:37:53.140 --> 02:37:58.380
[Guest]: And the people that are volunteering their time to make all of this happen for you, they

02:37:58.380 --> 02:38:03.380
[Guest]: don't deserve to hear this body language or actual words from you. But you have to think

02:38:03.380 --> 02:38:07.940
[Guest]: about the people standing behind that guy. And every instinct in your body says he's

02:38:07.940 --> 02:38:12.740
[Guest]: not going to protect them. But, you know, then what do you do? So the government has

02:38:12.740 --> 02:38:16.460
[Guest]: also done certain things. The government's in many, not just Canada, many governments

02:38:16.460 --> 02:38:20.980
[Guest]: have done, they have various kinds of companies inside the government. Every department has

02:38:20.980 --> 02:38:26.740
[Guest]: a company, right? In some departments, this is basically managing director plus peon.

02:38:26.740 --> 02:38:34.380
[Guest]: Because the company is a shell thing. And what it means is that there are lots of procurement

02:38:34.380 --> 02:38:41.100
[Guest]: in government that can, that needs to be tendered as per the rules. But if you tender to a government

02:38:41.100 --> 02:38:47.260
[Guest]: company, you don't need to follow that rule. You can just like award it to them. And they

02:38:47.260 --> 02:38:55.220
[Guest]: in turn can structurally award it to a subcontractor without a tender. So I've seen, not just now,

02:38:55.220 --> 02:39:00.020
[Guest]: in the past, I mean, some four years ago, I had a situation where somebody was saying

02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:04.660
[Guest]: this contract should be given to whatever some, some, I'm going to say, Connecticut

02:39:04.660 --> 02:39:10.060
[Guest]: Road Development Corporation or some such organization. So I said, okay, I was on some

02:39:10.060 --> 02:39:14.020
[Guest]: committee at that time. And I said, in my judgment, this organization cannot do what

02:39:14.020 --> 02:39:21.780
[Guest]: they're saying it's proposing to do. I would like to see their presentation on what it

02:39:21.780 --> 02:39:27.100
[Guest]: is. So they scheduled a presentation. And some guy from one of the multinational companies

02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:31.500
[Guest]: came to make that presentation. So I asked him, what company are you from? I mean, you

02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:36.620
[Guest]: don't sound like the kind of guy that would work for KRDL in any case. And he said, no,

02:39:36.620 --> 02:39:37.620
[Guest]: I'm from whatever.

02:39:37.620 --> 02:39:38.620
[Guest]: Big company. Big private company.

02:39:38.620 --> 02:39:50.220
[Guest]: Big Korean company. So I said, what are you doing here? He said, no, no, we are the subcontractors

02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:56.580
[Guest]: who will be executing it. I said, do you realize the contract itself has not been awarded?

02:39:56.580 --> 02:40:04.580
[Guest]: This notion of a government company as an internal capacity building organization is

02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:10.640
[Guest]: a dodge. It doesn't have anything like the kind of capacity for that service that exists

02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:12.980
[Amit Varma]: in the private sector.

02:40:12.980 --> 02:40:17.140
[Amit Varma]: But is it kind of then a necessary jugaad to get past their own red tape?

02:40:17.140 --> 02:40:21.900
[Guest]: No, it is not a necessary jugaad to get past their own red tape. If they want, they can

02:40:21.900 --> 02:40:22.900
[Guest]: cut the red tape.

02:40:22.900 --> 02:40:28.740
[Amit Varma]: But they won't do that, because that diminishes their power.

02:40:28.740 --> 02:40:36.780
[Guest]: So it is then not a necessary jugaad. It is a jugaad, but it is not a necessary jugaad.

02:40:36.780 --> 02:40:40.700
[Guest]: That's what I'm trying to say. So every time you ask this, you know, bad things, I'm always

02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:46.140
[Guest]: saying, so there's one more thing in government, which is useful. Among the senior bureaucracies,

02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:50.540
[Guest]: there's a lot of people who are married to other senior bureaucrats. That's actually

02:40:50.540 --> 02:40:56.620
[Guest]: a useful thing. You know what I mean? Because if you have an ally, you have actually two

02:40:56.620 --> 02:41:03.340
[Guest]: allies in getting something done. And often they're posted in slightly different things.

02:41:03.340 --> 02:41:08.540
[Guest]: So actually, you can get into some complementarity as well. And the government does one thing.

02:41:08.540 --> 02:41:13.540
[Guest]: I think the government does make an effort to post you together in the same job. I mean,

02:41:13.540 --> 02:41:16.700
[Guest]: you can go and ask, even if the government doesn't, you can sort of, you know, put in

02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:21.140
[Guest]: a request. And if you know where to put the request in, it'll be met. And all of those

02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:23.060
[Guest]: kinds of things are true.

02:41:23.060 --> 02:41:29.260
[Guest]: And therefore, in a field operation, like a relief operation, that's very useful. Because

02:41:29.260 --> 02:41:37.860
[Guest]: now you've got two people who can chase this stuff, right? And I've even, I had a situation

02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:44.380
[Guest]: some years ago, I'm not going to say who, in which somebody told me, either I or my

02:41:44.380 --> 02:41:50.620
[Guest]: spouse will become chief secretary three years from now, four years from now. You know, just

02:41:50.620 --> 02:41:54.020
[Guest]: you can figure out, if you look at the civil list, you can figure out who's going to become

02:41:54.020 --> 02:42:00.140
[Guest]: what. In fact, that system is so harmful, I'll tell you. In institutions like ISRO,

02:42:00.140 --> 02:42:06.180
[Guest]: I've seen this in ISRO, where people will look at the likelihood of them getting to

02:42:06.180 --> 02:42:12.500
[Guest]: the top one or two jobs based on an internal system of calibrating this. And they will

02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:18.140
[Guest]: actually say, I should take the last five years of my life and just go. I go and join

02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:22.780
[Guest]: Orbital Sciences Corporation, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, whatever it is globally. I have

02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:27.180
[Guest]: the necessary expertise. I'm not going to make it to the top. I might as well find a

02:42:27.180 --> 02:42:28.580
[Guest]: secure retirement.

02:42:28.580 --> 02:42:34.300
[Guest]: I feel the system should be relooked at. I think, I know nowadays some state governments

02:42:34.300 --> 02:42:39.980
[Guest]: feel it's all right to pick whoever for the top job, especially the chief secretary's

02:42:39.980 --> 02:42:44.740
[Guest]: job or the DGP's job, based on one or two eligible persons. I know there are even procedures

02:42:44.740 --> 02:42:51.340
[Guest]: for that nowadays. But I think it's actually a fairly deeply rooted system. And the media

02:42:51.340 --> 02:42:56.180
[Guest]: actually doesn't even know this well enough. The media will say, for example, Amit Verma

02:42:56.180 --> 02:43:00.900
[Guest]: has been promoted to the rank of additional DGP. It's got nothing to do with what Amit

02:43:00.900 --> 02:43:05.500
[Guest]: Verma did or did not do. There is a timetable. On that timetable there is an additional DGP.

02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:06.500
[Guest]: That's all.

02:43:06.500 --> 02:43:10.180
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it's kind of perverse that just by where you finish in the IAS rank and your

02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:13.380
[Amit Varma]: year of birth, you can basically predict how far you'll get in the system.

02:43:13.380 --> 02:43:17.260
[Guest]: So you have to do like a Malcolm Gladwell kind of thing on that and figure out if there's

02:43:17.260 --> 02:43:22.660
[Guest]: a January bias or something like that. But, you know, there might be such stuff. I would

02:43:22.660 --> 02:43:27.980
[Guest]: say something else that the civil list does get distorted from time to time because some

02:43:27.980 --> 02:43:34.180
[Guest]: people leave to go to the center. If you leave to go to the center, that's another set of

02:43:34.180 --> 02:43:40.300
[Guest]: distortion of that stuff. But I think it's important to keep in touch with the senior

02:43:40.300 --> 02:43:48.180
[Guest]: bureaucracy in particular, because genuinely they can move mountains inside the system.

02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:51.900
[Amit Varma]: Finish your anecdote, by the way, about what this person told you that in three years me

02:43:51.900 --> 02:43:53.380
[Guest]: or my spouse will be chief secretary.

02:43:53.380 --> 02:44:00.460
[Guest]: Yeah. So the advantage of that is the way that people cooperate with each other is actually

02:44:00.460 --> 02:44:07.020
[Guest]: based on some calculus like that. Right. I'm not talking about the political class. I'm

02:44:07.020 --> 02:44:13.340
[Guest]: saying the rest of the bureaucracy below them. And there's also the system, right? Bureaucrats

02:44:13.340 --> 02:44:16.980
[Guest]: behave a certain way in their 30s, a different way in their 40s, and a different way in their

02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:23.220
[Guest]: 50s. And the 30s are fairly uniform. The 40s are fairly uniform. The first half of the

02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:28.820
[Guest]: 50s are also fairly uniform. The second half of the 50s really depends on your batch here.

02:44:28.820 --> 02:44:32.540
[Guest]: Whether you're going to retire as principal secretary, whether you're going to retire

02:44:32.540 --> 02:44:36.420
[Guest]: as additional chief secretary, whether you're going to retire as chief secretary, and whether

02:44:36.420 --> 02:44:41.180
[Guest]: you're looking for post retirement continuity in government positions or not. There is a

02:44:41.180 --> 02:44:48.860
[Guest]: lot of variability in that last five years. And in some way, I think it's a useful thing

02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:55.020
[Guest]: to keep an eye on. Because a very large number of people with good networks are retiring

02:44:55.020 --> 02:45:03.180
[Guest]: every year. And among that group, there is a subset whose service to the country even

02:45:03.180 --> 02:45:08.740
[Guest]: after their retirement is desirable. But by and large, the government will not appoint

02:45:08.740 --> 02:45:15.380
[Guest]: them to any post retirement service if they are useful. I'm being quite blunt about this

02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:21.100
[Guest]: thing that you cannot become an election commissioner in this country, for example, if you're actually

02:45:21.100 --> 02:45:25.860
[Guest]: going to do anything to reform the commission. The very premise is that you're going to do

02:45:25.860 --> 02:45:33.980
[Guest]: exactly what was done in 1971 with half the people. So people get jaded about all of this

02:45:33.980 --> 02:45:39.780
[Guest]: stuff and start to say, go away. But I'll tell you one other thing. Many couples are

02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:44.380
[Guest]: like that, A or B being chief secretary kind of thing. I mean, Karnataka certainly has

02:45:44.380 --> 02:45:49.660
[Guest]: had at least seven, eight officers that I can just recall off the top of my head who

02:45:49.660 --> 02:45:52.860
[Guest]: meet that definition. Sometimes one of them will be in the police and the other one will

02:45:52.860 --> 02:45:59.660
[Guest]: be in the administrative services. But the thing is, there was one protest rally that

02:45:59.660 --> 02:46:06.660
[Guest]: I went to, I'm going to say seven or eight years ago, right? And I met somebody who had

02:46:06.660 --> 02:46:09.660
[Guest]: been married to a chief secretary. I mean, he was still married to the chief secretary.

02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:19.780
[Guest]: But when his spouse, his wife was in service, she was chief secretary. And I met him at

02:46:19.780 --> 02:46:25.580
[Guest]: this sort of protest rally, but something, some local civic issue. And I asked him, what

02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:29.420
[Guest]: on earth are you doing here? You know what, you were like a central government secretary,

02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:36.020
[Guest]: your wife used to be chief secretary. You shouldn't have to protest here on the street

02:46:36.020 --> 02:46:41.540
[Guest]: to do something like this. The street protest is for guys like me and others who really

02:46:41.540 --> 02:46:48.540
[Guest]: have to move the system without any authority at all. And he said, that's the cliff that

02:46:48.540 --> 02:46:53.860
[Guest]: you are facing in government. That when you're out of it, you're out of it. You're out of

02:46:53.860 --> 02:46:58.060
[Guest]: it, you're out of it. That's all it is. There is something that can be done to reform that.

02:46:58.060 --> 02:47:06.100
[Guest]: In my judgment, we need to have more officers come into the IAS from the states. You know

02:47:06.100 --> 02:47:14.020
[Guest]: what I mean? The unfortunate part is the way state officers get promoted into the IAS is

02:47:14.020 --> 02:47:19.420
[Guest]: set up in such a way that it is fairly late in their professional lives that they get

02:47:19.420 --> 02:47:26.500
[Guest]: inducted into the IAS. And they do not get what I would consider an age appropriate batch

02:47:26.500 --> 02:47:33.580
[Guest]: at that point. You know what I mean? You will get inducted into the IAS when you are 50,

02:47:33.580 --> 02:47:39.700
[Guest]: but in batch terms, in grade you will be, or rank you will be roughly where the 42-year-olds

02:47:39.700 --> 02:47:46.260
[Guest]: are. So you're never going to end up as one of the really top guys. I've seen that happen

02:47:46.260 --> 02:47:51.540
[Guest]: once or twice, but that was for political reasons. But you're not going to end up close

02:47:51.540 --> 02:47:56.020
[Guest]: enough. Most, in fact, don't even become additional chief secretaries. They only become principals

02:47:56.020 --> 02:48:03.060
[Guest]: secretaries. So I think, but the advantage of the guys inside the state system is that

02:48:03.060 --> 02:48:09.620
[Guest]: they have spent long years in the same departments. So they actually know something really well.

02:48:09.620 --> 02:48:15.140
[Guest]: That if you go to even a parastate, you go to BMTC or your best type thing in Mumbai,

02:48:15.140 --> 02:48:22.820
[Guest]: the guy who is number two in best knows the best inside out. If the guy who's number one

02:48:22.820 --> 02:48:26.900
[Guest]: can never know it the way the guy who's number two does, but the guy who was number two can

02:48:26.900 --> 02:48:33.300
[Guest]: never become number one in that system. It's theoretically possible, but for all practical

02:48:33.300 --> 02:48:38.740
[Guest]: reasons it doesn't happen. So we've set up a system of administration in which these

02:48:38.740 --> 02:48:46.940
[Guest]: things that are desirable are actually forbidden in practice. So this is what I meant by saying

02:48:46.940 --> 02:48:53.940
[Guest]: that you actually have a set of rules and laws and policies, which forbid good outcomes,

02:48:53.940 --> 02:48:59.700
[Guest]: except that they are written in the name of creating good outcomes.

02:48:59.700 --> 02:49:04.220
[Amit Varma]: It's so revelatory, all of this sort of discussion of the internal government structure. And

02:49:04.220 --> 02:49:07.820
[Amit Varma]: you know what you said about what that gentleman told you when he met you at the protest rally

02:49:07.820 --> 02:49:11.620
[Amit Varma]: that you just fall off a cliff when you're no longer in government. And I think one of

02:49:11.620 --> 02:49:15.020
[Amit Varma]: the key problems there is government just has too much power. And one question I'm not

02:49:15.020 --> 02:49:19.180
[Amit Varma]: going to ask you, because I feel it would be unfair to put you on the spot, is whether

02:49:19.180 --> 02:49:25.220
[Amit Varma]: in situations like this, what is a proportion out of 100 to which government is a help and

02:49:25.220 --> 02:49:28.980
[Amit Varma]: what is a proportion to which it is a hindrance? Because you work with government, so your

02:49:28.980 --> 02:49:32.780
[Amit Varma]: incentives will be tailored towards sort of emphasising the health of the people.

02:49:32.780 --> 02:49:36.140
[Guest]: No, no, I'm quite happy to answer that question. I'm quite happy to answer that question.

02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:38.780
[Amit Varma]: Go ahead. Okay, go ahead then.

02:49:38.780 --> 02:49:46.500
[Guest]: Because there's a certain interesting nuance to it. I'm going to say it's 15% that will

02:49:46.500 --> 02:49:57.980
[Guest]: help you. Yeah. Okay. 50% would be hostile. And about 30 odd percent will be all right.

02:49:57.980 --> 02:50:00.940
[Guest]: They need the help, but they're not hostile either.

02:50:00.940 --> 02:50:03.940
[Amit Varma]: This is about the people. What about the structures of government?

02:50:03.940 --> 02:50:07.500
[Guest]: The structure actually has no meaning, because there's a way of doing this. Let's say only

02:50:07.500 --> 02:50:14.540
[Guest]: 10%, 15% of the people will be helpful and even, frankly, in any worth keeping in government.

02:50:14.540 --> 02:50:21.860
[Guest]: Let me go to the extent of sort of saying something like that. But the thing is, every

02:50:21.860 --> 02:50:31.060
[Guest]: officer that you engage with is comfortable with that engagement in a way that assumes

02:50:31.060 --> 02:50:37.580
[Guest]: throughout that engagement that he or she is in that 15%. So that's really what it is.

02:50:37.580 --> 02:50:40.700
[Unknown]: Therefore, it's not really a big thing to say only 10% of the people are good or 15%

02:50:40.700 --> 02:50:44.300
[Guest]: of the people are good. It doesn't really create any, it doesn't burn any bridges, it

02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:50.260
[Guest]: doesn't ruffle anybody's feathers. And also, they themselves know it in a way.

02:50:50.260 --> 02:50:57.060
[Guest]: But there's a way. And there's another interesting thing about government. Let's say I am an

02:50:57.060 --> 02:51:03.900
[Guest]: emcee at an event, and you're one of the panelists. And I want to say to the audience, this is

02:51:03.900 --> 02:51:14.620
[Guest]: Amit Verma. He's held 23 jobs in the last 15 years. And therefore, he has a wide range

02:51:14.620 --> 02:51:20.020
[Guest]: of experience, rich experience in many different fields. But the audience is going to look

02:51:20.020 --> 02:51:30.180
[Guest]: at that and say, what crap. But you can go to any event where a senior public official

02:51:30.180 --> 02:51:42.380
[Guest]: is introduced, and I guarantee you that the spread of their postings is referred to and

02:51:42.380 --> 02:51:52.260
[Guest]: sort of hailed as a wide and important experience. And that, I think, is actually not because

02:51:52.260 --> 02:51:57.980
[Guest]: they, many of them are not even expecting it. Many of them will say this is just something,

02:51:57.980 --> 02:52:03.620
[Guest]: they're dismissive of the whole thing, they think this is just procedural. But for some

02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:11.780
[Guest]: reason, maybe it's just a hangover from the way power was derived and is exercised today.

02:52:11.780 --> 02:52:17.860
[Guest]: For some reason, we have too many people in the audience who are ready to clap before

02:52:17.860 --> 02:52:27.980
[Guest]: the batsman has scored. You know what I mean? Our spectators are hailing lots of play and

02:52:27.980 --> 02:52:34.740
[Guest]: miss, lots of dog balls, lots of hit on the helmet. But no matter what happens to the

02:52:34.740 --> 02:52:44.180
[Guest]: battle, there's a very large part of the spectator group that is cheering. And I actually don't

02:52:44.180 --> 02:52:51.220
[Guest]: know why it is, because if you ask me, I don't think the officers expect them to cheer.

02:52:51.220 --> 02:52:56.580
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean, it's a religion of government, firstly, and that's a lovely sort of very

02:52:56.580 --> 02:53:01.340
[Amit Varma]: illuminative thing you said about only 15% help, but 100% will think they are part of

02:53:01.340 --> 02:53:05.780
[Amit Varma]: that 15%. It's like Garrison Keillor's famous Lake Wobegon effect. Garrison Keillor was

02:53:05.780 --> 02:53:10.340
[Amit Varma]: a novelist who created this place called Lake Wobegon, where everybody was above average.

02:53:10.340 --> 02:53:14.820
[Guest]: And all the children are smart, all the women are good looking. I forgot that phrase that

02:53:14.820 --> 02:53:15.820
[Amit Varma]: he used.

02:53:15.820 --> 02:53:20.020
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. But the idea is the absurdity of everybody being above average, which you know, and in

02:53:20.020 --> 02:53:23.940
[Amit Varma]: fact, surveys have shown that everyone who drives thinks they are an above average driver,

02:53:23.940 --> 02:53:28.740
[Amit Varma]: which of course is not possible, right? Because what is even the meaning of average? So Ashwin,

02:53:28.740 --> 02:53:32.780
[Amit Varma]: you know, we have another 15 minutes of talking left, and I'm extremely grateful and feeling

02:53:32.780 --> 02:53:36.820
[Amit Varma]: a little guilty that I took so much of your time, because I think there are far more important

02:53:36.820 --> 02:53:41.020
[Amit Varma]: things you should be doing. So thank you for that. But my final question is really, in

02:53:41.020 --> 02:53:45.340
[Amit Varma]: a sense, a two part question, which is a question of where is this going? And I mean this in

02:53:45.340 --> 02:53:50.580
[Amit Varma]: two parts. One part is with reference to this immediate COVID-19 crisis, where is all of

02:53:50.580 --> 02:53:55.660
[Amit Varma]: this going? You've had a very close look at administration. In fact, one could say that

02:53:55.660 --> 02:54:01.180
[Amit Varma]: you've, you know, I think by and large, society solves its own problems, because in India,

02:54:01.180 --> 02:54:04.620
[Amit Varma]: especially the state is abdicated. And you've been a part of that. But you've also been

02:54:04.620 --> 02:54:09.460
[Amit Varma]: a part of getting the state to work. And you've seen that process close up. So in the immediate

02:54:09.460 --> 02:54:13.940
[Amit Varma]: sort of short to medium term, where do you see this going? And my other question is,

02:54:13.940 --> 02:54:18.140
[Amit Varma]: in the longer term, what will remain of this? Like, it is true that there are people who

02:54:18.140 --> 02:54:22.780
[Amit Varma]: are apathetic who will remain apathetic, but many people have felt connected to others

02:54:22.780 --> 02:54:27.580
[Amit Varma]: because of the shared experience of community suffering, and they've come out and they're

02:54:27.580 --> 02:54:31.340
[Amit Varma]: helping and all of that. Will that remain? Or will it be back to the old normal after

02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:35.900
[Amit Varma]: this is over? You know, how hopeful are you about that? What do you what do you see happening?

02:54:35.900 --> 02:54:46.220
[Guest]: So on that last question, there is now a deliberate effort to build those networks emerging from

02:54:46.220 --> 02:54:54.820
[Guest]: the relief effort, and create a structure for persistence out of them that can you create

02:54:54.820 --> 02:55:02.460
[Guest]: in some effect, a national volunteer organization that is not always it's about being standby

02:55:02.460 --> 02:55:10.620
[Guest]: to do relief work, but is active across a spectrum of activity, covering, you know,

02:55:10.620 --> 02:55:17.940
[Guest]: poverty, ecology, and maybe the economy. And therefore, it has many, many tentacles from

02:55:17.940 --> 02:55:23.420
[Guest]: which you can sort of emerge. And can you even link it to education, not only in the

02:55:23.420 --> 02:55:28.780
[Guest]: schools, but even other kinds of education, post, post schooling and post college. So

02:55:28.780 --> 02:55:35.420
[Guest]: definitely, there is thinking going on to say, we have to build this organization, the

02:55:35.420 --> 02:55:40.420
[Guest]: national, you know, a kind of a national volunteer organization, which I also think has a reasonable

02:55:40.420 --> 02:55:47.940
[Guest]: chance of representing or being another symbol of patriotism, even which is to say that there

02:55:47.940 --> 02:55:54.820
[Guest]: is another way to wave the flag, and in a way that is inclusive in a way that is progressive

02:55:54.820 --> 02:56:01.220
[Guest]: and all of that. And I think that so definitely, that is, as we speak, we're trying to construct

02:56:01.220 --> 02:56:08.740
[Guest]: that and see how that can emerge from something like this over time. Number one. Second thing

02:56:08.740 --> 02:56:15.500
[Guest]: is, I really believe that officials at different levels, not everybody, but you know, because

02:56:15.500 --> 02:56:20.500
[Guest]: especially because of the concentration of the competent that I referred to earlier,

02:56:20.500 --> 02:56:25.540
[Guest]: there is a set of officials who will come into contact with very large numbers of people

02:56:25.540 --> 02:56:31.300
[Guest]: in civil society, on whom they can count on for in some way to be able to do more things,

02:56:31.300 --> 02:56:36.500
[Guest]: no matter where they go in their careers. And that's a useful outcome as well, as far

02:56:36.500 --> 02:56:42.900
[Guest]: as the pandemic itself goes. I think almost certainly everybody now believes that wave

02:56:42.900 --> 02:56:47.540
[Guest]: three is coming, that it's going to hurt the children disproportionately, and there are

02:56:47.540 --> 02:56:53.380
[Guest]: a set of things that need to be done. I feel that the big cities will get to manageable

02:56:53.380 --> 02:56:58.820
[Guest]: levels of, when I say manageable, these are all terrible words, because manageable really

02:56:58.820 --> 02:57:06.220
[Guest]: in this context means acceptable losses, right? It's almost the language of war. The big cities

02:57:06.220 --> 02:57:14.660
[Guest]: will get to acceptable losses in a few weeks. The next set of cities could in some cases

02:57:14.660 --> 02:57:19.460
[Guest]: get there faster, but in some cases get there at least a few weeks later, but not much later

02:57:19.460 --> 02:57:26.420
[Guest]: than that. The thing that is giving everybody great cause for concern is the rural healthcare

02:57:26.420 --> 02:57:31.900
[Guest]: infrastructure, really the third tier of healthcare infrastructure, which historically has been

02:57:31.900 --> 02:57:39.460
[Guest]: so weak, has to be nothing more than a referral point, right? You say you've got a problem,

02:57:39.460 --> 02:57:43.140
[Guest]: so there's nothing really in your village, so you go to the PHC, which is itself one

02:57:43.140 --> 02:57:47.700
[Guest]: out of three villages, right, has a PHC. So then you go to the PHC, the PHC is basically,

02:57:47.700 --> 02:57:53.220
[Guest]: you know, I don't know, a pulse thermometer and a few other things. But so, you know,

02:57:53.220 --> 02:57:57.780
[Guest]: and maybe it had four people, and three of them had other jobs as well. So now you kind

02:57:57.780 --> 02:58:03.460
[Guest]: of, at the most, a referral center. And that also meant that if you had to go to some higher

02:58:03.460 --> 02:58:10.020
[Guest]: level of capability in the healthcare infrastructure, you really had to do that at your own cost

02:58:10.020 --> 02:58:13.460
[Guest]: and your own whatever. You know, you have to go somewhere, take care of yourself in

02:58:13.460 --> 02:58:18.140
[Guest]: another place, blah, blah, blah, all of that stuff, in addition to needing the care. But

02:58:18.140 --> 02:58:21.340
[Guest]: now you've got a situation where if you go to that facility, there are a thousand people

02:58:21.340 --> 02:58:27.700
[Guest]: like you at that facility. So that facility can reach a degree of self-sufficiency for

02:58:27.700 --> 02:58:32.740
[Guest]: the people that it was originally intended to serve. But it is continuing to be overwhelmed

02:58:32.740 --> 02:58:38.260
[Guest]: from the people who are from other jurisdictions that should have been served by anybody else.

02:58:38.260 --> 02:58:44.420
[Guest]: What historically has been a three-layer system for care, with different levels of healthcare

02:58:44.420 --> 02:58:49.740
[Guest]: capacity at each level. So the tertiary hospital needed to have capabilities that the secondary

02:58:49.740 --> 02:58:54.500
[Guest]: hospital did not, and the primary health center did not, right? Today, you have a situation

02:58:54.500 --> 02:59:00.820
[Guest]: in which the tertiary capability is needed in the village in some cases. And merely referring

02:59:00.820 --> 02:59:06.620
[Guest]: the person from the village to the district hospital is inadequate. That hospital is already

02:59:06.620 --> 02:59:14.100
[Guest]: swamped with serving the tertiary capacity that it is supposed to take care of. So, you

02:59:14.100 --> 02:59:20.300
[Guest]: know, I hate to say this. So far, I've not heard from any of the chatter, any of the

02:59:20.300 --> 02:59:28.060
[Guest]: groups looking at this problem, what the solution to this is. There is talk of one thing, which

02:59:28.060 --> 02:59:34.020
[Guest]: I find interesting, the idea of a small cluster of ICU beds, 10 beds at a time, 15 beds at

02:59:34.020 --> 02:59:39.700
[Guest]: a time that would go into the PHCs itself. And then, you know, some people are optimistic

02:59:39.700 --> 02:59:43.500
[Guest]: about telemedicine and teleconsulting and all of those kinds of things. I think it is

02:59:43.500 --> 02:59:49.460
[Guest]: possible for an NGO that is sufficiently organized to pull off 10 of this, 15 of this, 20 of

02:59:49.460 --> 02:59:56.820
[Guest]: this, whether all of us together can pull off, you know, 4,000 of that, 6,000 of that

02:59:56.820 --> 03:00:07.900
[Guest]: in large states. I have my doubts about that. I think we're in for a time of really difficult

03:00:07.900 --> 03:00:13.900
[Guest]: choices for a long time. And it's not simply a question of whether people live or die.

03:00:13.900 --> 03:00:20.180
[Guest]: Even if they're incapacitated a little. I had a situation reported to me a few days

03:00:20.180 --> 03:00:27.340
[Guest]: ago about somebody who, you know, his grandfather or somebody died of COVID. His uncle and aunt

03:00:27.340 --> 03:00:32.700
[Guest]: died of COVID. His mother had COVID, did not have COVID, or she had COVID, she went into

03:00:32.700 --> 03:00:36.340
[Guest]: the hospital. She recovered from the thing and then the ventilator failed or some, you

03:00:36.340 --> 03:00:45.180
[Guest]: know, some bizarre thing. And absolutely horrible, horrible stuff, that if the sum of all these

03:00:45.180 --> 03:00:53.820
[Guest]: stories doesn't tell even half of what is going on out there. And that is the scary

03:00:53.820 --> 03:01:01.500
[Guest]: part that I think it is only if you get involved that you'll actually know what is going on,

03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:08.460
[Guest]: that the media isn't a sufficiently useful source of information now.

03:01:08.460 --> 03:01:12.660
[Amit Varma]: So I have an observation for my listeners, really, and a final question for you. And

03:01:12.660 --> 03:01:18.220
[Amit Varma]: the observation is this, that I think almost everyone who listens to the show is part of

03:01:18.220 --> 03:01:22.780
[Amit Varma]: an English speaking elite. We live in a bubble. Some of us are outside India. Most of us are

03:01:22.780 --> 03:01:27.120
[Amit Varma]: inside India, but we are in our bubbles. And we miss the severity of the first wave because

03:01:27.120 --> 03:01:31.500
[Amit Varma]: it didn't happen to PLU, it didn't happen to people like us. Like a friend of mine told

03:01:31.500 --> 03:01:36.420
[Amit Varma]: me about this seroprevalence study that he had gotten done in Mumbai in December, I don't

03:01:36.420 --> 03:01:40.820
[Amit Varma]: know if the results were public, which found that 55% of people in the slums already had

03:01:40.820 --> 03:01:45.920
[Amit Varma]: had COVID, but only 11% of the people in the high rises. And one of the reasons that people

03:01:45.920 --> 03:01:51.060
[Amit Varma]: like us are noticing the second wave so much is that it has hit us. You know, earlier,

03:01:51.060 --> 03:01:54.980
[Amit Varma]: it was unseen because it didn't happen to us because we were safe in lockdown in our

03:01:54.980 --> 03:01:59.460
[Amit Varma]: high rises. Now it has hit us, we see it. And now what is going to happen moving forward

03:01:59.460 --> 03:02:04.440
[Amit Varma]: is as it recedes from the cities, it will devastate rural India. I mean, the magnitude

03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:10.880
[Amit Varma]: of the damage it could do is, my mind just boggles, it's incalculable. And it might again

03:02:10.880 --> 03:02:15.220
[Amit Varma]: be unseen to us. And that's my worry. So my final question to you, Ashwin, is this, that

03:02:15.220 --> 03:02:19.460
[Amit Varma]: if people listening to this say that I want to get involved, I want to help, but I want

03:02:19.460 --> 03:02:23.300
[Amit Varma]: to do it in a practical way. I don't want to be a pest. I don't want to just sort of

03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:27.700
[Amit Varma]: be a burden on the system. I actually want to help. What should I do with or without

03:02:27.700 --> 03:02:32.500
[Amit Varma]: you? Like, can I, you know, then the question to them would be that, how can I help you,

03:02:32.500 --> 03:02:36.660
[Amit Varma]: Ashwin? Or what else can a citizen do? So, you know, two-pronged question.

03:02:36.660 --> 03:02:40.700
[Guest]: I want to say one thing in response to what you observed. Certainly, it is true that people

03:02:40.700 --> 03:02:47.100
[Guest]: are responding because it is hitting them. I had a conversation with the head of a very

03:02:47.100 --> 03:02:52.420
[Guest]: large nonprofit organization, which is used to receiving lots of donations from, you know,

03:02:52.420 --> 03:02:58.260
[Guest]: major donors. And he said they are willing to donate more money because their executives

03:02:58.260 --> 03:03:03.780
[Guest]: are dying. That's really all it is, right? So there is some of that, that it is hitting

03:03:03.780 --> 03:03:08.660
[Guest]: us and therefore it's stirring some, you know, action in that thing. That's actually not

03:03:08.660 --> 03:03:13.540
[Guest]: very sustainable. It'll die off fairly quickly. In response to, I mean, die off is the wrong

03:03:13.540 --> 03:03:19.780
[Guest]: word to use, but in response to what you asked, I think there is a very simple thing. No matter

03:03:19.780 --> 03:03:27.980
[Guest]: where you live, there is a system of public health care for the area that you live in.

03:03:27.980 --> 03:03:35.940
[Guest]: If you are not able to do anything more than this, become aware of what that public health

03:03:35.940 --> 03:03:43.420
[Guest]: care facility is able to do and become supportive of it in whatever little way you can. Forget

03:03:43.420 --> 03:03:48.380
[Guest]: about, I'm not saying ignore the private thing, but no matter where you go, there's a public

03:03:48.380 --> 03:03:53.420
[Guest]: health facility that is supposed to serve you. Figure out how you can support it. If

03:03:53.420 --> 03:03:57.700
[Guest]: all you can do is figure out what it needs and surface that, do that. If you're able

03:03:57.700 --> 03:04:03.740
[Guest]: to meet some of those needs, either yourself or in collaboration with others, do that.

03:04:03.740 --> 03:04:11.980
[Guest]: But I think that if we do not resolve to engage with our public health institutions and infrastructure,

03:04:11.980 --> 03:04:16.460
[Guest]: no idea of development that we are thinking about is going to emerge. Keep in mind that

03:04:16.460 --> 03:04:21.740
[Guest]: in developed economies, developed societies, nearly a third of all public expenditure is

03:04:21.740 --> 03:04:30.900
[Guest]: on health. So really government equal to health for a lot of developed societies. If you say

03:04:30.900 --> 03:04:37.060
[Guest]: that the majority of the truth is the truth, then health is government. But if you really

03:04:37.060 --> 03:04:42.580
[Guest]: care about better governance, there's a very simple way. Go to your local PHC and improve

03:04:42.580 --> 03:04:45.900
[Guest]: it. You'll get the better governance that you're looking for.

03:04:45.900 --> 03:04:49.020
[Amit Varma]: Ashwin, more power to you. And thanks so much for your time and your insights.

03:04:49.020 --> 03:04:55.460
[Guest]: Good luck. I enjoy being on this program. I think it's adding a lot of value to people.

03:04:55.460 --> 03:05:02.540
[Guest]: I've said that before as well. And I'm thankful for what you're doing as well.
