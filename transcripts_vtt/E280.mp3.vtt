00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880
[Amit Varma]: Iris Murdoch once said, quote, Love is the extremely difficult realisation that something

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.260
[Amit Varma]: other than oneself is real, stop quote. I won't pontificate on love here, but I like

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.360
[Amit Varma]: the phrasing of something other than oneself is real. If you've heard recent episodes

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.920
[Amit Varma]: of the show, you might have heard me musing about our tendency to treat all other people

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.520
[Amit Varma]: like minor characters in a play or props in a scene in which we are the star and everyone

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.760
[Amit Varma]: else is there just to fulfil this function or that role. I think about this more and

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.800
[Amit Varma]: more these days, how reflexive it is to behave like the centre of the universe. And while

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.020
[Amit Varma]: this is something I grapple with at an individual level, where I try to be mindful of treating

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.400
[Amit Varma]: people as well, actual people. This is also something that plays out between groups. And

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.200
[Amit Varma]: indeed, if you look at how men have treated women through the ages, you'll find that

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.120
[Amit Varma]: a lot of it is based on function. Women have been forced into different roles and stereotypes.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.360
[Amit Varma]: And anything outside of that has been treated as surplus to requirement. And at one level,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.120
[Amit Varma]: the roles women have been pushed into may seem to fall between the extremes of those

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.600
[Amit Varma]: cliches of the whore and the Madonna. A book called Intimate City written by my guest today

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.520
[Amit Varma]: shows that in some ways, those extremes are not opposites, but even the same thing. For

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.520
[Amit Varma]: example, both sex workers and housewives are assumed to have given their consent away once

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.440
[Amit Varma]: they choose those roles. Marital rape is still not considered a crime in India. And lawyers

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.920
[Amit Varma]: have argued in court that the rape of a sex worker cannot be a big deal because well,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.840
[Amit Varma]: they're used to sex as sex workers. In a different context, my guest spoke about how at different

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.320
[Amit Varma]: points in time, quote, life outside marriage or prostitution has been impossible for women.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.120
[Amit Varma]: Stop good. You'll have to listen to this full conversation to hear the full argument. But

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.520
[Amit Varma]: for now, I'll share a third commonality between a sex worker and a housewife, as they have

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.960
[Amit Varma]: typically existed, that they are both instrumental to the needs of the men in their lives, their

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.920
[Amit Varma]: autonomy, their personal needs and desires. The interior lives don't matter. They fulfill

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.520
[Amit Varma]: a role. That's all that matters. And I think you'll agree with me that to reduce human

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:14.040
[Amit Varma]: beings to this is a terrible crime. And we do it in many contexts other than this.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.240
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:28.240
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma. Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.200
[Amit Varma]: today is a sociologist Manjima Bhattacharya, author of a book called Intimate City, which

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.960
[Amit Varma]: I loved and recommend to all of you. Intimate City is about the changing face of sex work

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.960
[Amit Varma]: across the world. And in India, it looks at how globalization and technology have transformed

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.120
[Amit Varma]: sex work. And I found many things here in common with the way the creator economy has

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.520
[Amit Varma]: evolved. The book also takes a close look at the way in which feminism has evolved in

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.480
[Amit Varma]: how it looks at sex work. At first, appalled by the objectification and the presumed lack

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.240
[Amit Varma]: of consent, but later accepting that all sex work does not arise out of trafficking. And

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.800
[Amit Varma]: sometimes women exercise their agency in choosing sex work over other available ways to make

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.360
[Amit Varma]: a living. At first, I thought this episode would be mainly about this book, and perhaps

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.160
[Amit Varma]: touch on Manjima's previous book, Manequin, which looked at the women who worked in India's

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.320
[Amit Varma]: glamour industry. But as we got talking, I got more and more fascinated by Manjima's

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.560
[Amit Varma]: journey into feminism, activism, sociology, and just by the way her thinking evolved with

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.080
[Amit Varma]: all the work and the writing she did. So the first half of this episode is about her journey

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.120
[Amit Varma]: as a feminist. And then we talk about the changing face of sex work. There are many

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.200
[Amit Varma]: sharp insights in this conversation. And while listening to the edit, I found myself forced

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.360
[Amit Varma]: to stop and process some of them. I think you'll enjoy it as well. But before we get

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.800
[Amit Varma]: there, let's take a quick commercial break. Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.600
[Amit Varma]: of work in recent years in building a reading habit. This means that I read more books,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.840
[Amit Varma]: but I also read more long form articles and essays. There's a world of knowledge available

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.560
[Amit Varma]: through the internet. But the problem we all face is how do we navigate this knowledge?

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.280
[Amit Varma]: How do we know what to read? How do we put the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.320
[Amit Varma]: one way. A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.480
[Amit Varma]: Which aims to help people up level themselves by reading more. A few months ago, I signed

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.880
[Amit Varma]: up for one of their programs called the Daily Reader. Every day for six months, they sent

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.760
[Amit Varma]: me a long form article to read. The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.280
[Amit Varma]: to mental models and marmalade. This helped me build a habit of reading. At the end of

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.200
[Amit Varma]: every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before. So if you want to

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.200
[Amit Varma]: build your reading habit, head on over to CTQ Compounds and check out their Daily Reader.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.920
[Amit Varma]: New batches start every month. They also have a great program called Future Stack, which

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.120
[Amit Varma]: helps you stay up to date with ideas, skills, and mental models that will help you stay

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.160
[Amit Varma]: relevant in the future. Future Stack batches start every Saturday. What's more, you get

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.160
[Amit Varma]: Manjima, welcome to the scene in the unseen. Thank you, Amit.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.440
[Amit Varma]: So you know, before we start, and I've completely been fascinated by the sort of work you've

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.760
[Amit Varma]: done and both your books, Manequin and Intimacy, particularly Intimacy, because in so many

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.960
[Amit Varma]: ways, the changes that are reflected in that book are changes, I think taking place not

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.840
[Amit Varma]: just in that industry, or not just regarding sexual relations, but pretty much all around

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.120
[Amit Varma]: us in many different ways. But before we get to kind of talking about that, I'm keen on

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.560
[Amit Varma]: knowing more about you, like, where did you grow up? You know, what was your childhood

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.560
[Guest]: like?

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.560
[Guest]: This is one of those very difficult questions to answer, as always. And I'm glad you have

00:05:52.560 --> 00:06:00.160
[Guest]: a long interview lined up for it. I grew up in the Middle East in Kuwait. I was born in

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.680
[Guest]: a place called Dig Boy in Assam. And it's a really interesting name, because they say

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.480
[Guest]: the legend goes that British person said, Dig Boy, and they dug and they found oil.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:19.560
[Guest]: And so, you know, it was one of those oil townships that I was born in. And from there,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:27.120
[Guest]: in the 80s, in 80, actually, there was a flight of many engineers when the conflict started

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.960
[Guest]: in Assam, actually, that a lot of people moved to the Middle East, because the oil industry

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:41.520
[Guest]: there was booming at the time. So my father was part of that flight. And so I grew up

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:51.400
[Guest]: through the 80s, I lived in Kuwait. And until the first Gulf War 1990, which is when Saddam

00:06:51.400 --> 00:07:02.480
[Guest]: Hussein invaded Kuwait. So till then, I grew up in Kuwait, a life of a quiet life, a very

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:10.800
[Guest]: an expat life, one would say, very conscious of being South Asian. So the South Asian community

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.960
[Guest]: was really close. I think it was very unusual. I mean, there is the universal experience

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:24.880
[Guest]: of the NRI, which you see in Jhumpa Lahiri's novels and so on. So that emotional thread

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.960
[Guest]: was very much there in our lives of being away from home and so on. But it was also

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:37.840
[Guest]: very distinct because the Gulf is a very different place. It is, you know, there's no lot of

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.880
[Guest]: people talk about being from small towns versus being from big cities. But in the Middle East

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.200
[Guest]: or in Kuwait, at least, it wasn't like that. There was no small town and there was no big

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.000
[Guest]: city. There was only one big city, Kuwait City, which is the capital. Otherwise, there

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.120
[Guest]: was small townships, like there was housing societies in a sense, you know, localities

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:03.880
[Guest]: where you stayed. So you never felt, you know, there was neither the small town nor was there

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:11.360
[Guest]: a big city. So your community was for us, it was the Bengali, the Bengalis create a

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.960
[Guest]: cultural society wherever they go. So the Bengali cultural society was basically, I

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:22.080
[Guest]: would say, the community that we were part of. And then there was school and it was very,

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:30.320
[Guest]: if I were to put a color to it, it was a very sandy, sort of a yellow, dusty brown, serene

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.960
[Guest]: sort of a landscape. And then there's the blue of the sea. And it was very, very quiet,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:43.400
[Guest]: almost as quiet as this room, even quieter than this room that we're sitting in. And

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.280
[Guest]: I mean, the only only the hum of the AC. So it was a very quiet life and one with a rhythm

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:56.320
[Guest]: of its own going to school. And I went to an English school and we had, you know, it

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:03.280
[Guest]: was sort of you went to play in the desert kind of area. We had small sheds where libraries

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:11.280
[Guest]: were there. I was chief librarian at age nine or something. Yeah, it was quite idyllic in

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.720
[Guest]: its own way, but very specific to to a certain group of people who lived in Kuwait in the

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.280
[Guest]: 80s. I'm sure people who live in Kuwait now would not have the same experience. I think

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.760
[Guest]: the South Asian identity was also very important. Bollywood was a big influence. That's how

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:38.280
[Guest]: we connected to India. That's how I learned Hindi. I mean, you know, we had in our building

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.880
[Guest]: there was a culture of videocassette borrowing. So and there was also a culture of really

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:50.560
[Guest]: stretching your, you know, whatever you paid. So if one family hired a videocassette for

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.040
[Guest]: a week, everybody in the building had to watch that because, you know, that's the only way

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:03.740
[Guest]: that we would be in solidarity with one another. But it was also actually fun. So that one

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:10.200
[Guest]: video would traverse every single flat in that building. And so in that, so I've watched

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:17.920
[Guest]: all kinds of rubbish through the 80s. But it was it had a function of connecting us

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:26.640
[Guest]: to each other and also to connect us to back home. The second phase, I would say I was

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:33.320
[Guest]: Delhi actually, which is where I went after the first Gulf War, then after the invasion.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:39.800
[Guest]: And that was then exciting. You know, you're in your teens. This is Delhi, which is Delhi

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:49.800
[Guest]: in the 90s. Very disposed globalization, India, you have channels, TV channels of all kinds

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:57.240
[Guest]: and you know, the really changing landscape. But still something about, you know, Delhi

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:02.800
[Guest]: doesn't change also still, even in that time. So then finished school there, I finished

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:10.760
[Guest]: college, I went to, you know, I did my post grad there, etc. And then moved to Bombay

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:17.840
[Guest]: in the mid 2000s, 2007. And since then, I've been living here. In the middle one, for one

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:27.640
[Guest]: year I lived in Geneva, which was a brief foray into really working with an international

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.960
[Guest]: organization called WILF. It was one of the first women's organizations in the world.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:39.720
[Guest]: 1916, it was started after the First World War to sort of make sure women have a seat

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:48.640
[Guest]: at the peace negotiations. And it was a really good experience. It was a year in WILF's office

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.040
[Guest]: in Geneva and where a lot of the work was really being at the United Nations office

00:11:53.040 --> 00:12:00.240
[Guest]: and monitoring all kinds of gender related issues. So, have I gone off your question

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.240
[Guest]: completely?

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.480
[Amit Varma]: No, this is lovely. These are the kind of sort of, you've given me many things to double

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.560
[Amit Varma]: click on. And it's kind of lovely for that reason. And one of them that strikes me is

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:18.000
[Amit Varma]: this that you described these specific things about Kuwait, like it was so silent and you

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.200
[Amit Varma]: know, the colors sandy and sandy slash brown and the sea was blue and all that. And I remembered

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.800
[Amit Varma]: this scene from a scene from a film I saw in my childhood, Steven Spielberg's Empire

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.760
[Amit Varma]: of the Sun, where, and I've completely forgotten the plot, I've forgotten everything about

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.560
[Amit Varma]: it. But I remember there's a scene where there's this kid at a dining table, I think it's a

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.920
[Amit Varma]: kid and the house is being emptied because they're moving away. And everything is silent,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.240
[Amit Varma]: right? This complete silent on the screen. And then suddenly it becomes more silent.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.720
[Amit Varma]: And it becomes more silent because I've taken the clock down. So the tick tick which you

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:56.960
[Amit Varma]: had normalized of the clock, that's gone. And that's when you realize that the clock

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.600
[Amit Varma]: was there, even though it was there earlier, but that's when you notice it. And I'm thinking

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.320
[Amit Varma]: that these impressions that therefore that you have of Kuwait that it was so silent and

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:12.440
[Amit Varma]: this was the color, are these things that you thought about in retrospect, because at

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.920
[Amit Varma]: the time, I'm guessing would not have had a frame of reference to compare it with, like

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.040
[Amit Varma]: the hustle bustle of Bombay or, you know, the sounds of Delhi and you know, those reference

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:27.920
[Amit Varma]: points wouldn't have been there. And so is this something that you've kind of done looking

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:33.440
[Amit Varma]: back? And is that looking back something that, you know, you do once in a while, like in

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:40.480
[Amit Varma]: the sense that I often think about how non self aware I was at that time. So whatever

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.600
[Amit Varma]: awareness I have of myself as a person in that time as a boy, almost like you're looking

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.080
[Amit Varma]: through a prism when you're looking at someone else, right? Is that awareness was not there

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.520
[Amit Varma]: in that boy then that that's it's kind of looking back that you're aware of what was

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.640
[Amit Varma]: going on. So, you know, so when has it come through looking back and when you look back

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.920
[Amit Varma]: at yourself in Kuwait and the texture of your days and what are you doing and all of that?

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.920
[Amit Varma]: What do you feel?

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:11.960
[Guest]: It's an interesting question. I'm not sure it's entirely in retrospect. I think even

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:18.360
[Guest]: at that time, you know, we would come on holiday to India maybe once in two years and and it

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:27.120
[Guest]: was really it's one of the most obvious sort of experiences, right? Also, I feel it's interesting

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:34.560
[Guest]: you mentioned the clock because I mean, I have had to make my dad take off the wall,

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.680
[Guest]: the clock in in a bedroom when I once went to stay over at their place because the ticking

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:46.800
[Guest]: of a clock sounds really loud to me to me. So it was both I would say it's you know,

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.560
[Guest]: we realized it while growing up that this was silent and it was a it was now I realized

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:59.360
[Guest]: it was a luxury, you know, in in in the context of living in Bombay, particularly. So part

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:04.360
[Guest]: of it is when you think back and it may be these are the things that you know, these

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:09.920
[Guest]: are the cherries on top that you're actually remembering. So you're not remembering the

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:15.760
[Guest]: other kinds of cacophony or problems that may have been there. But, you know, that's

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:23.280
[Guest]: the the pleasant taste that you want to carry with you that you're actually, you know, emulsifying

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.640
[Amit Varma]: in a sense in your mind.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:31.200
[Amit Varma]: Like the other strand I've also want to explore in this is that whole thing of video cassettes

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.920
[Amit Varma]: being passed around in one family as a video cassette, everyone watches it in a week. And

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.760
[Amit Varma]: that's, you know, familiar, because it was like that for everyone here as well. Obviously,

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.200
[Amit Varma]: there's a scarcity of things as scarcity of entertainment, you can't, there's no smartphone

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.160
[Amit Varma]: that you can whip out and watch what you want. So you know, if like Doordarshan would show

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.800
[Amit Varma]: one foreign film a week at 10pm at night or whatever. So, you know, there's this people

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.720
[Amit Varma]: like to say that in which Annie gives it those ones, Pradeep Kishan film, which Arundhati

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:03.160
[Amit Varma]: Roy wrote, it aired only once on Doordarshan. But the fact is, everybody from my generation

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.480
[Amit Varma]: saw it that one time that it aired, right? Because that was the only thing that you had

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.520
[Amit Varma]: to look forward to. And now when I look back on that, it's interesting. And I don't know

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.920
[Amit Varma]: if I can put a finger on it. But here's the thing, we are obviously shaped by all these

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.720
[Amit Varma]: influences when we are children, it's the people around us, the little communities,

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.400
[Amit Varma]: they might be part of or we might be part of and so on. And the films we watch the books

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:32.640
[Amit Varma]: we read, and so on and so forth. And in those days, a lot of that reading was indiscriminate,

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.920
[Amit Varma]: you read whatever you could get your hands on and so on and so forth, ditto with films.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.240
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of it was also cliched, because you'd have the same set of reading kind of

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.480
[Amit Varma]: go around all kids would read and Ed Blighton and Hardy Boys and then, you know, get a little

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:52.800
[Amit Varma]: older and read another set of books, Woodhouse and so on. Similarly, with, you know, with

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.120
[Amit Varma]: music, you know, you'd go to college and it would be the same rites of ritual, the same

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.720
[Amit Varma]: 70s classic rock and all of that would kind of happen. So in that sense, there is this

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:08.520
[Amit Varma]: common layer that binds all of us in a manner of speaking. And today, since you're a mother

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.960
[Amit Varma]: with two growing kids, also, you would have seen them grow up as well. And today one,

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.720
[Amit Varma]: I think that that common layer isn't necessarily there, because across fields across cinema,

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.720
[Amit Varma]: music, the mainstream is dissipated, there are so many niches and so on. So that common

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:29.720
[Amit Varma]: layer isn't there. And also, I wonder whether serendipity then plays a greater role in how

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:35.000
[Amit Varma]: they are formed. Like, you know, looking back, I can see two things about myself. And one

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.720
[Amit Varma]: thing is that I have changed enormously to the extent that I was just a completely different

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:45.560
[Amit Varma]: person then. But there is something that was essential to the way that I was formed, which

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.860
[Amit Varma]: would could be the kind of music I like or the kind of reading I like, which is sort

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:55.640
[Amit Varma]: of stayed the same, and which was, in a sense, almost shaped by accident as it were. So what

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.240
[Amit Varma]: are sort of your thoughts on this as someone looking back at yourself and also looking

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.920
[Amit Varma]: at your kids today, where the whole world is sort of, in a sense, open to them. It's

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:10.080
[Amit Varma]: not just one video cassette circulating through society.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:16.120
[Guest]: I mean, it's interesting you say that because in Kuwait, Kuwait also had two channels, right?

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:25.760
[Guest]: There was KTV1 and there was KTV2. So and there also you waited to watch English films.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.220
[Guest]: There was used to be a show hosted by called Cine Club, which was hosted by an Egyptian

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:37.360
[Guest]: critic called Farooq Abdul Aziz. And so Thursday night and my parents would allow me to stay

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.480
[Guest]: up and watch that they were not interested themselves. But I was that was one thing I

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:47.240
[Guest]: was allowed to stay up and watch these, you know, world films that used to come on Thursday

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:52.280
[Guest]: night and used to be presented by Farooq Abdul Aziz. And so I used to wait, I used to listen

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:59.700
[Guest]: to his whole analysis in Arabic of the film and then, you know, sort of watch the film.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:06.600
[Guest]: And one of those films that I saw, I feel in retrospect really shaped me. And I don't

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:12.200
[Guest]: remember what the film was, but it was a young woman who decides to become a nun, goes to

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:19.560
[Guest]: Nicaragua, goes to, I think, a Latin American country. And she's driven to actually serve

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:27.720
[Guest]: people and she's driven to resist violence. And she's very young. She becomes a nun, goes

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:34.520
[Guest]: there and and then gets murdered by those very by people while she's in the process

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:42.880
[Guest]: of helping them. And for some reason, that film and really the sincerity of the protagonist

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:52.840
[Guest]: stayed with me. And really, if I think back, it really made me channel, you know, a lot

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:59.560
[Guest]: of my energy and my later decisions, I feel, were guided some way through what the emotion

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.880
[Guest]: that I experienced while watching that film. And so similarly, you know, when you talk

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:09.880
[Guest]: about cultural journeys, it's a lot of things, you know, I mean, I feel like, yeah, we do

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:16.440
[Guest]: read similar stuff, etc, etc. But there are many factors that facilitate that, you know,

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:22.120
[Guest]: Kuwait did not have many bookshops. And you were always dependent on a parent to take

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:28.280
[Guest]: you to a library, etc. So, you know, it was my luck that my father would, he never said

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.520
[Guest]: no. If I said, okay, he would come back from office and I would say, I need to go to the

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.720
[Guest]: library, he would go back and it was a long drive back, etc. And take me patiently go

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:43.600
[Guest]: to the library, wait with me and bring things back. So, you know, there are those, those

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.120
[Guest]: kind of nurturing of interest, which and when you talk about my children, I realize how

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:55.800
[Guest]: important facilitating is having a facilitated journey. And I think it's also what you sort

00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:03.440
[Guest]: of pick up in today's day and age, for example, you're saying there's so many various streams

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:09.000
[Guest]: you could sort of go down, right? It's not the same big, thick channel that you're everybody

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.720
[Guest]: swimming in. But I realize now more and more that actually, they're very, very individual

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.500
[Guest]: choices. So my son is very different from my daughter. There was a period where everybody

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:26.680
[Guest]: read Harry Potter, right? But now it's not like that anymore. And you're right in that.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.640
[Guest]: But there still are, there still are those who will pick up Harry Potter. There are also

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:38.240
[Guest]: many forms that I feel we were not, you know, we read the Enid Blyton's and, you know, and

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.760
[Guest]: I'm very conventional reader, you know, I grew up reading Nancy Drew's and she was,

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:50.200
[Guest]: I would say my first big influence in terms of feminism was probably Nancy Drew. She was

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.240
[Guest]: this independent girl going about doing everything on her own with a very supportive father and,

00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:02.200
[Guest]: you know, the whole doing detective work and driving around. It was like a dream to be

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:14.120
[Guest]: Nancy Drew, you know. But in, so there was one sort of form that we found. Now I find

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:21.400
[Guest]: that there are so many different, even games or gaming, I would say, you know, is actually

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:28.880
[Guest]: a way to explore, to have a cultural journey of your own. And I think those options perhaps

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:36.720
[Guest]: we didn't have. Now you're right. My kids do have them and many children have them.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.600
[Guest]: But I would hesitate to say that it's very, very different. There are still, there's still

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:46.440
[Guest]: a values framework, you know, when you think in terms of a framework, there's still a certain

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:54.000
[Guest]: set of values that each of these are constructed on. So there will be some element of racism,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.400
[Guest]: you know, there will be some sexism. They're embedded into all of these kinds of narratives,

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:12.120
[Guest]: even YA stories and so on. But there is, but kids are able to now see those things in a

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.960
[Guest]: better way, which is like the debates on Enid Blyton and the Gollywogs, for example. In

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.200
[Guest]: our time, we never thought twice about it in that sense, right? Now kids are talking

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:28.480
[Guest]: about it. They talk about representation in very serious ways. And I see that especially

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:34.440
[Guest]: in my daughter's case where she's 16. And so there is so much conversation on representation,

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:41.320
[Guest]: on expression, on gender identity, sexual identity. Not so much for my son yet, but

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:47.880
[Guest]: definitely for her. So there's a lens which is now different also, which we have to account

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:53.760
[Guest]: for, which wasn't there in our time. Again, I feel I've gone off topic.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.680
[Amit Varma]: No, you can't possibly go off topic as long as you're talking about yourself. So, you

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:04.520
[Amit Varma]: know, I did an episode with Mrinal Pandey, where she told me about this period of time

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:10.880
[Amit Varma]: in her childhood when she realized that her mother is not only cooking meals for her husband

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.200
[Amit Varma]: every day, but is actually stressing out over them, trying really hard to make food that

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.760
[Amit Varma]: he likes. And she, I think Mrinal must have been 15 or 16 at the time, and she completely

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.520
[Amit Varma]: lost it. And she told her mother that how can you do this? Why are you wasting so much

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.760
[Amit Varma]: mental energy and emotion and all this over what a man is eating? And I was really struck

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.640
[Amit Varma]: by that, because at the time that this would have happened, perhaps in the 1960s, I was

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.800
[Amit Varma]: wondering that all of this is purely instinctive on her part. The frames came later. And as

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.680
[Amit Varma]: she pointed out also, as her reading expanded, the frames came later through which you begin

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.040
[Amit Varma]: to understand all of these and see these hidden structures, as you called it. And you mentioned

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.800
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, in your daughter's case, of course, because we are open to the world and

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.720
[Amit Varma]: everything is so global, and we are influenced to thought from everywhere, that these frames

00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:01.160
[Amit Varma]: are there, so she can see that. In your case, how did that awareness kind of come about?

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:06.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there is, I would imagine at one level, there is that instinctive thing that no, this

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.600
[Amit Varma]: is unfair. And then at another level over a period of time, one builds a frame where

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:15.720
[Amit Varma]: you then look at it and say that no, this is unfair, because and then you kind of go

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:21.120
[Amit Varma]: further. And obviously, when you're educated, you might be learning those in a formal way.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:26.680
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise, what was that period of formation like? Like in my case, I remember and you

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.600
[Amit Varma]: know, the show is called the scene in the unseen. This is a classic case of the scene

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:36.080
[Amit Varma]: in the unseen that, you know, most men don't realize that there is an invisible layer that,

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, an invisible layer of awareness that women carry with them and everything

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:44.000
[Amit Varma]: they do. I can go for a walk at midnight, and there's no issue. But women have to think

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.160
[Amit Varma]: twice, you get into a lift, you look you look around at all the other people who are there.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.600
[Amit Varma]: And it took me well into adulthood to even realize that there was this extra layer, right.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.440
[Amit Varma]: But women obviously figure it out earlier. And I guess the options then would be that

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:01.520
[Amit Varma]: you normalize it, that this is the way things are, or you get pissed off, and you start

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:07.240
[Amit Varma]: thinking deeper about it. So what was that process for you of finding the feminist in

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.400
[Amit Varma]: yourself and shaping the feminist in yourself?

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:22.720
[Guest]: I would say, really, the experience of violence is the most obvious, even in a household where

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:28.360
[Guest]: one doesn't face discrimination. You know, I didn't realize that gender discrimination

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:35.920
[Guest]: was not really part of my, I didn't realize it until I was in college, in a sense, you

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:41.920
[Guest]: know. And I'm sure that's the case for many people of my generation, class, caste, etc.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.720
[Guest]: Because you're going to school, you're not deprived of anything, you don't face that

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:55.020
[Guest]: kind of discrimination at home, in terms of food, etc. But I think the experience of violence,

00:26:55.020 --> 00:27:01.840
[Guest]: so sexual violence, harassment, I realized very early on that, okay, this is something

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.800
[Guest]: that's wrong, you instinctively realize, you know, that this is wrong, that I have to fight

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:12.200
[Guest]: against it, that I have to, you know, either hit back or elbow jab or whatever it is. But

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:17.520
[Guest]: I cannot tell my parents, you know, because I don't want them to stop me from going out

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:25.240
[Guest]: on my cycle, etc. So I have to hide it, it has to be a secret. But I also can't let it

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:32.480
[Guest]: get me down, you know, that's also there. So I have to, whatever, resolve it in my head.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:37.800
[Guest]: And I have to keep doing what I'm doing. So I think for me, that was the, that's the unseen

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:45.120
[Guest]: that I experienced, but I kept unseen from everyone around me. And it's a recurring thing

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:51.640
[Guest]: that, you know, would keep happening at different ages, at six, at eight, at whatever, 12, you

00:27:51.640 --> 00:28:00.720
[Guest]: know, and then in buses in Delhi. So actually, sexual harassment is the primary experience

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:09.280
[Guest]: that makes you really realize that something is amiss and very rotten, something is rotten.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:18.880
[Guest]: But the real sense of that something is even more off, structurally off, I think happened

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.760
[Guest]: when I was doing my, did my graduation in economics at the Sriram College of Commerce

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:29.560
[Guest]: in Delhi University. And there was a professor there, Professor Bose, Professor AJC Bose,

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.440
[Guest]: and he used to have this famous thing called the Bose notes, you know, which you used to

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:38.740
[Guest]: buy in the cyclo style shop. And he used to have these notes for developmental economics.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:44.640
[Guest]: But in between, he used to have lyrics of Pink Floyd songs or Springsteen songs and

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:51.600
[Guest]: so on. And he was like a bit of a dude, you know, legend at that time. But he, he told

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.920
[Guest]: me when I asked him once, it was a BA in economics was very classical at the time, I don't know

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.640
[Guest]: if it still is. And I asked him, I said, you know, all this is all about men. What about

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:10.200
[Guest]: the work and labor that my mum does, my grandmum does? Nothing is showing up in all these in

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.600
[Guest]: the last three years that we've been studying economics, you know, it's just been abstract

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:22.280
[Guest]: and about the world, the male world, you know. And he told me that, you know, there is a

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:29.320
[Guest]: women's movement out there. Why don't you go and find it? You know, and they'll give

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:35.840
[Guest]: you the answer to this question. And that was the first time I then I went looking,

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:42.360
[Guest]: he asked me to go and visit Brinda Bose, who was a professor at Hindu College then. I went

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:49.240
[Guest]: to her, she told me, you know, Kali for Women, the publisher, they have a diary that they

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.800
[Guest]: bring out every year. And at the back of that there is a list of women's organizations.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.520
[Guest]: So why don't you go in? And I went to the people tree, which used to be this shop next

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:03.200
[Guest]: to Regal in Delhi, and they used to have the Kali for Women diary. So I bought the diary

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.720
[Guest]: for that year. And then I looked at the back. And my best friend, Anvita and I, we went,

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:14.760
[Guest]: I said, let's go and visit these places. So one by one, we went to visit them. And I think

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:21.160
[Guest]: the third organization I went to, which was Jagori, which is a feminist group in Delhi.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:27.280
[Guest]: I went there and said, you know, I want to work here. And Abha who was running that place

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:33.600
[Guest]: at the time, she said, okay, come from tomorrow. So I said, okay, fine. It was a really hot

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:39.320
[Guest]: day in April in Delhi. And she said, yeah, come, come from tomorrow. So then I started

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:45.360
[Guest]: working in Jagori. This was my third year in college. And I'm still with Jagori in a

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:53.440
[Guest]: sense I'm on their board now. But so that started me on a line of questioning that I

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:58.960
[Guest]: hadn't asked before. And I realized that okay, so, you know, this whole question of women's

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:04.160
[Guest]: why is it? Why is housework women's work? I hadn't thought about it. I thought it was

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:09.520
[Guest]: some accident of fate that you know, my mom was just doing that. It is so naive, you know,

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:16.080
[Guest]: really. And it shows showed me like how privileged we are and the blinkers we wear really, you

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:24.720
[Guest]: know, in in the world we live in. So anyway, that was sort of my how I found the women's

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:30.720
[Guest]: movement and today in today's day. I mean, that's an even now I'm, you know, I had not

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:36.480
[Guest]: yet found feminism even when I joined Jagori. I think as part of Jagori, then I went to

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:43.320
[Guest]: a workshop where I was given the task of doing the English report. And it was a workshop

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:50.080
[Guest]: with rural women in UP of the Mahila Samakhya program. Mahila Samakhya was a adult literacy

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.640
[Guest]: women's literacy program that the government had started. And it was being sort of it was

00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:00.320
[Guest]: taken up with a lot of enthusiasm by lots of feminist groups who were working with the

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:05.440
[Guest]: state for the first time in a sense, you know, otherwise they had mostly worked sort of against

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:11.120
[Guest]: the state or demanding that they make laws and so on and so forth. So they were providing

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:18.480
[Guest]: the perspective building to this generation of, you know, adult women who were learning

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:25.120
[Guest]: to read and write and creating collectives and so on. It was a women's empowerment program.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:30.320
[Guest]: So in that, I think that was the training in which I'd gone just to write the report

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:34.640
[Guest]: that I realized it was a gender training. And that was where I was introduced formally

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:41.160
[Guest]: to the idea of feminism. And feminism and it was like a third eye open for me, you know,

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:49.820
[Guest]: it all everything fell into place, how gender roles and in the idea of what was expected

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:56.140
[Guest]: from women and men, how different it was, and how it was actually not the same across

00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:02.440
[Guest]: the world, which meant it was fluid. I mean, it was it was socially constructed. And that

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:08.640
[Guest]: got me really thinking about these kinds of things and explained to me a lot of my own

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:15.960
[Guest]: experiences of violence and explained to me why the context of say my mum or my grandmum

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.720
[Guest]: and my aunts and so on and the world around me, I could just could understand everything

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:26.960
[Guest]: clearly, you know, after that. And I think there was one moment in that in particular

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:36.040
[Guest]: that I'd like to say that was a we took all the participants went to watch a show of Mrityudand,

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:45.560
[Guest]: which was a film by Prakash Jha. And in that, there's a scene in which Shabana Azmi plays

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:53.320
[Guest]: the role of the of one of the sort of protagonists and she she gets pregnant. And the younger

00:33:53.320 --> 00:34:02.480
[Guest]: sister-in-law asks her, whose baby is it? And she says, it's my baby. And it was such

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.880
[Guest]: a powerful statement. And the next day, people couldn't stop talking about that particular

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:14.360
[Guest]: moment where we, you know, just the understanding that this child could be mine. It doesn't

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.920
[Guest]: it's not you don't have to name the father. It's not the father's really our bodies

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:26.920
[Guest]: are our own, our wombs are our own. So that it was such a radical idea. So I think moments

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:36.640
[Guest]: like that, you know, built one on top of the other stacked up to really create, for me,

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:42.080
[Guest]: an understanding of feminism that became a lens through which then I actually then proceeded

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:47.840
[Guest]: with my activism as well as my academic work and so on. And, yeah.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:54.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And again, sort of the accidents of life that, you know, Professor Bose happened

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.000
[Amit Varma]: to be your economics teacher. And had you asked some other economics teacher, you might

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.080
[Amit Varma]: not have been told go and, you know, maybe some other chain of events gets you there,

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.280
[Amit Varma]: but not this. So, you know, like before this, what is it that you wanted to do? Like, what

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.400
[Amit Varma]: was your image of yourself that these are the things I will do in the world? Like, like

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.160
[Amit Varma]: many of us in our generation, whatever we studied was kind of by accident, you just

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:19.000
[Amit Varma]: drift into something and inertia and you kind of go along and it has no relevance with what

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.960
[Amit Varma]: you end up doing. So were you also drifting or were there specific things you wanted to

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:27.160
[Amit Varma]: do? And then when this sort of light bulb moment happens, and this third eye opens,

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.520
[Amit Varma]: as it were, do you, you know, how did that change things? And how did that shape the

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.680
[Amit Varma]: direction that you sort of went in after that?

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:41.600
[Guest]: I'll have to go a little bit further back to answer that, because I, my daughter asked

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:48.600
[Guest]: me recently, what did you want to be when you were young? And then it got me thinking

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:54.920
[Guest]: and I realized that, you know, until the Gulf War, I did have dreams. I did think that,

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.680
[Guest]: you know, I wanted to be a surgeon, which is, I mean, you know, these are not really,

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.960
[Guest]: I suppose, our own dreams. But you hear, you think that you'll do something, you'll save

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:09.360
[Guest]: people or whatever. But so I wanted to be a surgeon. And I realized that actually, since

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:19.400
[Guest]: the invasion, and the way life changed overnight, I stopped having dreams for myself. I stopped

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.880
[Guest]: thinking that, okay, when I grow up, I want to be this, I want to be that. And I actually

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:29.040
[Guest]: hadn't realized it until she asked me that. Yes, I mean, until then, I had wanted to be

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:35.840
[Guest]: a doctor. But then, since then, I never thought I want to be this, I want to be that. I drifted.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:40.800
[Guest]: I went by what I thought interested me at the moment. And I think I had the maybe luxury

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:46.720
[Guest]: of doing that, because maybe there you have gender, you know, a gender role sort of here

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.140
[Guest]: where nobody's telling you to be an engineer or doctor, maybe that that's not the case

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:58.880
[Guest]: for many boys of that time, or, you know, socioeconomic class. So I didn't, I didn't

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:04.880
[Guest]: know much about sociology. But after then, I once I'd finished my graduation, I realized

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:11.240
[Guest]: that actually the questions I was asking, fitted much more into the stream of sociology.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:18.360
[Guest]: And so then I thought, okay, I let me try to do sociology. And then I just loved, I

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.840
[Guest]: loved the subject. And I loved sociology, I never thought that I would be and one doesn't

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:29.040
[Guest]: dream I grew up and be a sociologist, something like that. Not a very glamorous occupation.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:34.200
[Guest]: But I also feel you don't have to be one thing in a lifetime, you know, I really find that

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:43.520
[Guest]: I mean, and now I am a writer. So one can say that, yes. I always knew that writing

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:53.000
[Guest]: was something I would always do. But, but yeah, I mean, you know, it's that dream that

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.560
[Guest]: you know, the Marx has this thing, right? You want to go fishing in the morning, you

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:01.920
[Guest]: want to do your writing in the afternoon or whatever, there are three things that he says

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:12.280
[Guest]: that, you know, you can do many things in a day. And in your life, I feel as you as

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:18.520
[Guest]: you age, and as you discover yourself more and more and more, you realize what you want

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:23.600
[Guest]: to do. So I feel like you should have one career in a decade, like every decade, you

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:30.480
[Guest]: should change your career. I work in the development sector. So that is, that's an important thing

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:37.280
[Guest]: that I carry with me. But alongside I do several things. So I have multiple, actually interests

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.480
[Guest]: and therefore, careers in a sense.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.840
[Amit Varma]: What was it about leaving Kuwait that made you stop having dreams? Or is it maybe you

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.840
[Amit Varma]: can't put your finger on why or looking back? Do you think you know, because the way you

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:56.280
[Amit Varma]: kind of, it almost seems like a defining moment that something happened and you just stopped

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.280
[Amit Varma]: thinking?

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:02.480
[Guest]: And this is in retrospect completely. And one didn't, one went along with the flow at

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:10.480
[Guest]: that time. It was because, you know, I never saw my, the house that we left when, I mean,

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.720
[Guest]: we left just the night of the invasion. And that was by accident, because we didn't, we

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.960
[Guest]: were coming on holiday. And so we were never able to go back to that house when my father

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:26.400
[Guest]: was able to go back. You know, you one heard that there was, you know, so it's very visual

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:33.160
[Guest]: actually what he found when he went back. We used to have a green carpet. It used to

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:40.840
[Guest]: be wall to wall carpeting all the houses. And after the invasion, when the oil wells

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:45.640
[Guest]: were all burning, right, you would have seen those images of that time, fantastic images

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:52.280
[Guest]: of just black skies and just blazing fires from the oil wells. And what happened was

00:39:52.280 --> 00:40:01.520
[Guest]: that crude condensed, these were air conditioned homes. So when the crude went inside the flats,

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:07.040
[Guest]: they would condense and they would sink into the carpets. So actually, when you step into

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:12.120
[Guest]: the carpet, you squelch. So you're going into like little lakes of crude oil, essentially,

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:20.640
[Guest]: you know, and you have black stained walls. And so this is the kind of image I heard from

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:25.840
[Guest]: my father when he did go back after the war was over. But essentially, I never went back

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:31.400
[Guest]: to that house. I never went back to that school. I never went back to that life. And many years

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:39.120
[Guest]: later, only when Facebook came around, did one reconnect with, you know, my classmates

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:49.000
[Guest]: from around the world over there. So it was like, I think it demonstrated that things

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:56.600
[Guest]: can change completely. You cannot, you can make all the plans you want in the world.

00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:04.320
[Guest]: But I mean, who knows what will happen. So subconsciously, I think that's the message.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:09.800
[Guest]: That's the big headline, you know, like in neon mounted that, you know, that was like

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:22.360
[Guest]: blinking in my head. And so, you know, that's the reason I think why one stopped having

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.080
[Guest]: very fixed plans.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.800
[Amit Varma]: I'm also interested by something you said a while back about showing that film, where

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:36.400
[Amit Varma]: the Shabana Azmi character says ki yeh mera beta hai, yeh mera bacha hai and how the women

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:42.080
[Amit Varma]: reacted to that. And it just strikes me as a lightbulb moment. Like what I sometimes,

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.760
[Amit Varma]: like the phrase I use while talking about ideas is that sometimes in life, people have

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.760
[Amit Varma]: a lightbulb moment and it goes off and you can't turn it back off. It's always on. Right.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.880
[Amit Varma]: And this is such a good example of that. What was it like that? Because, you know, I would

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.500
[Amit Varma]: assume that at that event, then what you've done is you facilitated a lightbulb moment

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:05.680
[Amit Varma]: for so many people. And I presume over your over the time you worked in that field, you

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.280
[Amit Varma]: know, there have been those lightbulb moments and so on and so forth. So what are those

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.880
[Amit Varma]: like? Because each of those must be so mind blowing to witness someone's third eye going

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:19.280
[Amit Varma]: on, as it were, to go back to the description that you used. So what was that like? And

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:25.360
[Amit Varma]: was there something to hope for in that, in the sense that in general, I am a pessimistic

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.760
[Amit Varma]: person when I look around me, because we can see what is happening around us. You know,

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:35.800
[Amit Varma]: we can, we haven't made all that much progress, if at all, in so many areas like gender, caste,

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.480
[Amit Varma]: and the religious othering, of course, is now particularly out of whack. But in all

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:44.720
[Amit Varma]: of these areas, we haven't made that much progress. So there is at one level, this sort

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.600
[Amit Varma]: of deep sinking feeling that, hey, this is who we are, and we're never going to get out

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:52.960
[Amit Varma]: of this mess. But at the same time, what you're describing is that it is possible to light

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.960
[Amit Varma]: off these lightbulb moments to make things happen to make people see the world differently,

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.760
[Amit Varma]: especially to make women see the world differently. You know, I had a guest on the show a while

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.000
[Amit Varma]: back, Shruti Kapila, who was talking about how tragic it is that women in India don't

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.520
[Amit Varma]: form a vote bank, because if they did, then you know, they could set so many things right.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.400
[Amit Varma]: And almost as a counter to that, a few weeks ago, I had the journalist Rukmini S on the

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:20.200
[Amit Varma]: show. And she pointed out that there is no such thing as a women vote bank, because like

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:24.240
[Amit Varma]: all of us women contain multitudes, right? So you've got your own priorities, just as

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:30.120
[Amit Varma]: your family does. And it's not that all women everywhere will work as one. I know this is

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.120
[Amit Varma]: a bit rambly, but I'm intrigued by that, that the fact is that there can be lightbulb moments

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:39.800
[Amit Varma]: that they are lightbulbs, as it were. So, you know, these same women whom you see react

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:45.240
[Amit Varma]: like this, do they then go back to their lives, and they just live lives of quiet desperation

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:51.560
[Amit Varma]: as Thoreau would put it or is social change actually happening on the margins at a glacial

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.440
[Amit Varma]: incremental pace, but it's real.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:59.840
[Guest]: I have now been part of the women's movement for 25 years. So I can tell you that change

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:06.920
[Guest]: is happening. You know, I feel in the everyday, it's very hard to see. So this is the thing

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:13.600
[Guest]: about change, right? It is incremental. It's not linear, it goes back and forth. And it's

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:20.320
[Guest]: in, I mean, some things that we think are, what we might not define as success, may actually

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:27.320
[Guest]: be defined by others as success. And I can give you some examples of that. But before

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:36.480
[Guest]: that, I'll say that, you know, everything is a bargain, right? There's this scholar

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:41.920
[Guest]: called Denise Gandiotti, and she has a term called bargaining with patriarchy. And how

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:46.040
[Guest]: actually across the world in different cultures, we have different kinds of patriarchy where

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:51.120
[Guest]: some things are valued more than others. So in the case of India, Middle East, etc, there

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:56.120
[Guest]: is very classic patriarchy where shame and honor, for example, is the most important

00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:02.440
[Guest]: framework, right? So it's inexplicable why a family would murder their daughter, right?

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:10.040
[Guest]: It doesn't make sense. But in their context of classic patriarchy, where shame and honor

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:18.520
[Guest]: are the most valued social currency, you have to understand it in that context, really understand.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:26.600
[Guest]: Now everything that women's wins have always been through small, small bargains with patriarchy.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:35.560
[Guest]: So okay, I will, you know, it's like I will go to school, but I will wear a certain kind

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:42.160
[Guest]: of clothing or I will, you know, do all the housework, then I will go out for paid work.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:50.720
[Guest]: You know, everything is actually small bargains with patriarchy through which you make, come,

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:57.240
[Guest]: move ahead. For us, we do see change happening over generations, right? We know that our

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:01.640
[Guest]: mother's lives, my grandmother's life, my mother's life, my life, my daughter's life,

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:07.080
[Guest]: very, very different. And they are, that's the visible change. So over generations, you

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:14.160
[Guest]: see change happening. In my work, not for us, we see it in generations, but in some

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:20.440
[Guest]: places. So for example, in places in rural India, even a small change will be very conspicuous

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:28.040
[Guest]: and very big. So a young girl talking to a young boy, you know, it will be seen as something

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:39.760
[Guest]: very huge. It might lead to a dangerous situation and so on. So it depends from context to context.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:46.560
[Guest]: So I am so hopeful because I never, when I joined the feminist movement, people didn't

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:54.280
[Guest]: know what feminism was. It's unthinkable that today a 21 year old as I was then doesn't

00:46:54.280 --> 00:47:00.640
[Guest]: know what feminism is, right? Now, everybody knows what feminism, feminism is so mainstreamed,

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:07.720
[Guest]: even though it's sometimes I feel it's oversimplified. And it's fashionable, etc. So in a sense,

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:12.700
[Guest]: I mean, even I've dropped, I've stopped calling myself feminist researcher and writer because

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:14.640
[Amit Varma]: it doesn't make sense anymore.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:17.200
[Guest]: Everybody's posturing and all of that.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.960
[Guest]: And I'm, and actually, when I say feminist researcher and writer, it's because I'm a

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:28.520
[Guest]: scholar of feminism. So it's not exactly the same thing. But the point is that now nobody

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:34.480
[Guest]: has to buy the Kali diary and go hunting for a women's organization and work in institutional

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:40.220
[Guest]: feminism to experience, to be a feminist, to practice activism because of the internet,

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:45.040
[Guest]: they can do it, you know, they don't have to be in a women's group to be an activist.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:50.960
[Guest]: So it's a completely different scenario, the quality of conversation Amit has changed. So

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:58.640
[Guest]: I used to work on violence against women when I joined Jagori. Even today, the issues that

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:03.840
[Guest]: say a Jagori or any other women's organization works on might be the same. But the quality

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.780
[Guest]: of conversation has changed. For example, the conversation on victim blaming, on claiming

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:14.520
[Guest]: public spaces on the right to be out and about on the right to mobility to wear what women

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:20.560
[Guest]: want to wear. These kinds of conversations have now become mainstream, which wasn't the

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.000
[Amit Varma]: case 20 years back.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.040
[Amit Varma]: Just thinking aloud, like I often, you know, transplant this saying about futurists and

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:35.600
[Amit Varma]: science fiction writers to the creative economy. And I talk about how creators often overestimate

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:40.120
[Amit Varma]: the short term and underestimate the long term. And it seems to me that maybe that is

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:46.360
[Amit Varma]: what social workers should be wary of as well, of overestimating the short term, and imagining

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.920
[Amit Varma]: that they'll see dramatic changes, and of underestimating the long term and giving up

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.720
[Amit Varma]: hope because they don't see anything happening immediately. And what you seem to be describing

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:59.400
[Amit Varma]: is that yeah, you know, if you're zoomed into the present moment, it may seem that nothing

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:03.920
[Amit Varma]: is changing or is too slow and you might be frustrated and why should I bargain with patriarchy

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.840
[Amit Varma]: and blah, blah, blah. But if you zoom out, then you see that yeah, you know, our lives

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:13.720
[Amit Varma]: are different from our mothers and their mothers and so on and so forth. And that's really

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:19.440
[Amit Varma]: interesting. And I, you know, just speaking of sort of shifting ways of thinking in your

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:24.600
[Amit Varma]: book Manik, when you speak about the influence of the Mathura case from 1979 on the women's

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:28.720
[Amit Varma]: movement, which again, seems like a light bulb moment for my listeners, what really

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.760
[Amit Varma]: happened there was this, this girl was raped by these two cops, and they got acquitted

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:39.400
[Amit Varma]: because the argument of the acquittal was that she was habituated to sex and therefore

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:46.920
[Amit Varma]: it was kind of okay. And you speak about how that created a Philip, in a sense for the

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.920
[Amit Varma]: feminist movement and, you know, set a chain of events and people could kind of organize

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:58.200
[Amit Varma]: about that. And there's a passage from your book Intimacy, which also I'll read out where

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:03.160
[Amit Varma]: towards the end when you speak about interviews with sex workers, you write, quote, we see

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:07.680
[Amit Varma]: from the interviews that once someone consents to enter the occupation of escorting, further

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:12.440
[Amit Varma]: consent is not deemed necessary. There is a sense that wives and sex workers don't have

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:17.160
[Amit Varma]: a right to consent, because they have already offered lifelong consent simply through participating

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:22.440
[Amit Varma]: in their respective institutions. Mugdha's experience of rape is akin to marital rape.

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:27.280
[Amit Varma]: In this sense, escorting is a lot like housewifery in its vulnerabilities and the emotional labor

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:32.840
[Amit Varma]: involved. And this really struck me because you speak about how, you know, even sex workers

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:39.160
[Amit Varma]: complain about the binaries of the whore and Madonna that that kind of and the false binaries,

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:43.040
[Amit Varma]: of course, that exist. But here you actually see an example of where whether you're from

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:48.160
[Amit Varma]: this extreme or that extreme and quote, unquote, around extremes, of course, consent is simply

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:52.320
[Amit Varma]: not given importance. I mean, you look at the current debates around marital rape, you

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:59.880
[Amit Varma]: kind of feel that at some conceptual levels, there is still a glacial pace of at least

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:04.680
[Amit Varma]: the way that the law operates in society at large operates, even if the discourse has

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:11.280
[Amit Varma]: changed that many more people can talk about consent and sort of voice all of this. And

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:16.520
[Amit Varma]: this was in fact, one of the most striking passages from your book for me, because it's

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:21.080
[Amit Varma]: quite a revelation to realize that whether you're a sex worker or a housewife, the Madonna

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:26.040
[Amit Varma]: or the whore, you still are not supposed to have consent in this in this country, which

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:30.240
[Amit Varma]: is just crazy, which, you know, and I completely understand that your big picture view is that

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:34.540
[Amit Varma]: you take a zoom back and things have gotten better and it's incremental and it's glacial.

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:37.200
[Amit Varma]: But all this stuff is still there.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:45.120
[Guest]: Yeah, I think consent is a little complicated. And I know it's one of the principles. I was

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:53.960
[Guest]: telling you, I watched your show with Kavita yesterday and with Kavita Krishnan, which

00:51:53.960 --> 00:52:01.360
[Guest]: is a documentary, the video thing. And I, you know, I know consent is one of the principles

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:09.600
[Guest]: that I've understood you sort of really honor. I feel in and you're right. I mean, the point

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:17.800
[Guest]: I was trying to make in the passage that you read out is that actually for sex workers

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:25.520
[Guest]: and for in this case for escorts and for wives, while most clients find consent to be a very

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:32.160
[Guest]: important value, they have explicitly stated in all the interviews I did that they would

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:37.840
[Guest]: not want to actually be with someone who has been coerced. And so consent and consent on

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:47.520
[Guest]: the Internet is actually verbalized, you know, which is not so clearly done in the everyday.

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:56.360
[Guest]: But their understanding was that once a woman has consented to being an escort, then further

00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:02.080
[Guest]: consent is not required. So, you know, within that, then anything can, you know, she's open

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.520
[Guest]: to anything. That's their assumption that no further thing is required. If she's consented

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:11.880
[Guest]: to be in the vocation, that's enough. And so I make a parallel that it's the same for

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:19.040
[Guest]: many housewives in a sense, because once you have agreed to be a wife, then your marital

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:24.720
[Guest]: duties, which is how the, you know, which is a commonly used term in law, actually,

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:29.280
[Guest]: you are expected to fulfill your marital duties. There's no further consent required in that.

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:36.040
[Guest]: And that is one of the blocks or obstacles to conceiving of marital rape in the eyes

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:42.560
[Guest]: of the law. So this is that's the context in which that quote is sort of talked about.

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:47.280
[Guest]: But I want to complicate this idea of consent and agency a little bit, because I don't know

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:53.000
[Guest]: if you'll remember, there was this video that went viral, you know, people trying to explain

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.080
[Guest]: consent and there's this cup of tea, like if someone, you know, there's basically tea

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:03.400
[Guest]: and if you say no to tea, to having that cup of tea, then nobody can force you to have

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:06.920
[Guest]: that cup of tea. So this was a video that went viral trying to explain this idea of

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:12.240
[Guest]: consent. So if you haven't consented to drinking that tea, you can't, you shouldn't be, you

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:16.680
[Guest]: shouldn't have to have that tea. And I, when I watched it, I was like, you know, this is

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:21.160
[Guest]: not true in India, because consent is much more complicated than that, right? You have

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:27.080
[Guest]: tea for various reasons. I cannot imagine going to do my fieldwork in rural India and

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:31.360
[Guest]: not having tea in some even though I'm not much of a tea drinker, and I'm very specific

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:41.480
[Guest]: about my tea. But it means that I am not practicing casteism. It means that I am comfortable in

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:46.320
[Guest]: a rural location. It communicates so many things. I mean, can you imagine going to some

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:52.360
[Guest]: my aunt's house or someone and refusing to have tea or a mithai or, you know, lunch or

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:58.480
[Guest]: dinner or whatever, you know, you, you can't do it. So even if I don't want to do it, one

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:06.840
[Guest]: has to do it for the various meanings that are there in that surrounding it. And so I

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:11.680
[Guest]: feel sometimes we get stuck in this idea of consent as being very black and white, but

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:17.120
[Guest]: it isn't. And yeah.

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:22.760
[Amit Varma]: You know, it also reminded me of, and this is something Rukmini pointed me to in the

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:27.800
[Amit Varma]: episode I did with her, where we were discussing, actually, where we were discussing sex workers

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:34.120
[Amit Varma]: and why sex workers throughout Southeast Asia are wary of Indians, because Indians apparently

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:38.680
[Amit Varma]: are especially brutal and so on. And she pointed me to this book by Srinath Perur called If

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:43.400
[Amit Varma]: It's Monday, It Must Be Madurai, which is a travelogue. And he goes to Thailand with

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:47.800
[Amit Varma]: a bunch of tourists. He's basically going on these tourist trips to different places

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:52.400
[Amit Varma]: and seeing what happens. So is it Thailand or is it one of the ex Soviet Republic countries,

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.800
[Amit Varma]: but wherever he goes to this place, people go for sex tourism and he describes the people

00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:00.440
[Amit Varma]: who are with him and how they are treating sex workers. And there's one particular scene

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.400
[Amit Varma]: where, you know, to the effect of that, once a sex worker has consented to come with you,

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:10.680
[Amit Varma]: you can do whatever, you know. And this notion of women sort of as a property of men requiring

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:16.480
[Amit Varma]: the permission of men, which is much worse than even this, because at least before agreeing

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:21.120
[Amit Varma]: to this, the sex worker is her own person, but is enshrined in our laws. I mean, even

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:27.360
[Amit Varma]: if the adultery law went, for example, you know, 497, which was the adultery law, spoke

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:32.240
[Amit Varma]: about how if a person has sex with the wife of another man, quote, without the consent

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:37.200
[Amit Varma]: or connivence of that man, as if she is a man's property, then he is guilty. And one

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.640
[Amit Varma]: law that is still there is 498, which is enticing or taking away or detaining with criminal

00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:47.320
[Amit Varma]: intent a married woman, where again, you know, if somebody entices away a woman who he knows

00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:51.360
[Amit Varma]: to be the wife of another man, now quote, from that man or from any other person having

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:56.520
[Amit Varma]: the care of her on behalf of that man, and blah, blah, blah. So it's not treating the

00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:01.200
[Amit Varma]: woman as someone with agency, it's treating her as sort of the property of a man. And

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:05.360
[Amit Varma]: this is enshrined in our laws. And luckily, I think what is happening is I agree with

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.440
[Amit Varma]: you on the broader point that social change is happening, even if it's slow, because I

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:15.240
[Amit Varma]: remember that if, for example, 377 was struck down in 1988, it wouldn't have gone quietly,

00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:20.080
[Amit Varma]: and it wouldn't have been greeted with such public celebration as it was when the law

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:24.080
[Amit Varma]: against homosexuality went. And some of these laws are still there, and hopefully they will

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:29.480
[Amit Varma]: go in time. But given your circles, there is, to some extent, I guess a little bit of

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:34.040
[Amit Varma]: selection bias, because you would be moving around with other feminists and activists

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:38.600
[Amit Varma]: and people who are involved in the field. But when you sort of look around, are there

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:43.000
[Amit Varma]: moments where you pause, are there moments through these years, in fact, where you've

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.040
[Amit Varma]: said, is there any point to this? And I am perhaps sounding a bit bleaker than I should

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:52.680
[Amit Varma]: be. But I'm looking around at what is happening on other margins in our society. And wondering

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:57.760
[Amit Varma]: if in certain other areas, we're actually slipping backwards. You know, for example,

00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:01.600
[Amit Varma]: women's participation in the workforce has gone down drastically over the last 15 years.

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:06.720
[Amit Varma]: I've had a bunch of episodes on this, most recently with Shrena Bhattacharya. So I mean,

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.520
[Amit Varma]: I'm not even pushing back against what you're saying, because I agree with it. I think if

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:15.040
[Amit Varma]: you zoom in, you can see that, you know, we do tend to overestimate the short term and

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:20.840
[Amit Varma]: a lot of progress is possible. But you know, are there moments where you've doubted this?

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.240
[Amit Varma]: What's that journey sort of been like?

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:30.160
[Guest]: Every day, every day, one wonders, you know, what, what this world is coming to, what this

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:36.200
[Guest]: country is coming to? Should one move to Canada? All these questions.

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.200
[Amit Varma]: Why Canada?

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:46.560
[Guest]: I mean, anywhere, but you know, why not Canada? Yes, I think so. So it's not, when I said

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:53.420
[Guest]: that yes, change is happening, it's certainly in a certain field. There's also regressive

00:58:53.420 --> 00:59:01.040
[Guest]: changes happening, say in another field. So like in the case of definitely in the situation

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:09.960
[Guest]: of Muslim, you know, communities in the country, it's unimaginable what they must be going

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:17.320
[Guest]: through right, right now. So it is, things have become in terms of free speech and expression,

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:25.560
[Guest]: what we're facing. It's really and really impoverishment and economic precarity, which

00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:32.760
[Guest]: is the context of, of countries around the world, I feel, but especially India, there

00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:38.000
[Guest]: is a certain return to poverty, which we can see, which may not be reported in our, you

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:45.560
[Guest]: know, but we see it around us every day. Young boys just digging sides of roads as that's

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:54.960
[Guest]: their future or I have seen a return to street sex work like last eight years in the area

00:59:54.960 --> 01:00:00.880
[Guest]: where I live. One didn't really see soliciting happening, but now one sees it's back and

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:07.040
[Guest]: it's there in many other parts of the world as well now. So definitely the situation and

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.160
[Guest]: women's workforce participation, I mean, we can talk about that separately, because I

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:21.640
[Guest]: think Mannequin was very connected to that. I think there are very much such, such moments,

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:26.440
[Guest]: but there's also resistance to it, right? There's also, I mean, we've had the CAA protest,

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:32.520
[Guest]: we've had the farmers protest, we've had student protests, we have the emergence of a range

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:38.000
[Guest]: of feminism. So like you said, there are multitudes even of feminisms, right? There's, you know,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:45.200
[Guest]: Dalit feminism, Muslim feminism, there is, these are emerging as very strong conceptual

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:52.640
[Guest]: frameworks with their own histories, their own origin stories and their own, I hesitate

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:59.720
[Guest]: to say cadre, but you know what I mean, like a strong network of people who are actually

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:07.000
[Guest]: taking that agenda forward. So the struggles are continuing and then there's hope in that,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.560
[Guest]: you know, that's the, that's the hope that we'll keep fighting, we'll keep resisting

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:21.440
[Guest]: and you know, there'll be more and more people joining that, that sort of stream of resistance.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.840
[Guest]: And it's unfortunate that we could be spending our time really discovering new things, thinking

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:33.200
[Guest]: new things, like just doing amazing things. And instead, we are having to protect these

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:39.040
[Guest]: gains that we have made that we are now going back on. Yeah, I think that, so that's one

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:47.680
[Guest]: part of the answer. The other part is actually being wary of moves that appear progressive,

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:56.520
[Guest]: but are actually regressive. So for example, laws like, and you spoke of laws, laws like

01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:01.600
[Guest]: the one against triple talaq that was created, that seemed to be, that was promoted as being

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.480
[Guest]: or projected as being something for Muslim women. But actually what it does is demonize

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:13.880
[Guest]: Muslim men or say raising the age at marriage, which nobody's stopping anyone from marrying

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:21.920
[Guest]: at 21. But this actually increases that 18 to 21, the vulnerable age where young people's

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:27.280
[Guest]: sexuality is criminalized. And you know that our laws criminalize and you know, parents

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:31.240
[Guest]: are constantly using different kinds of laws to prevent daughters from marrying of their

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:38.880
[Guest]: own choice or having intercaste relations and so on. So that increases that the captivity

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:48.240
[Guest]: of actually girls in between 18 and 21. So, you know, these kinds of legislation that

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:53.920
[Guest]: profess to be progressive, and actually nobody will say no, right? Nobody will say that no,

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:57.720
[Guest]: I don't think that 21 is the right age to marry. I don't even think 21 is the right

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:03.320
[Guest]: age to marry. But who gets affected by a law like that? Actually, it is poor people who

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:12.480
[Guest]: are marginalized groups for whom getting their girls married at 18 is a way of survival.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:18.960
[Guest]: It has its own logic. And it is a way for many young girls to actually escape violent

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:28.560
[Guest]: homes and to try and, you know, have an adult life. Because for us, we don't have an either

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:35.560
[Guest]: you're married or you're a child and then you're married. I mean, there's no in between

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.600
[Guest]: sort of phase which is allowed to majority of women, you know, to live an independent

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:45.920
[Guest]: life. There's no imagination. Like you said, you know, the adultery law and so on. So many

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:55.360
[Guest]: laws are framed around a wifehood, right? So everything is the family is like the family

01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:02.800
[Guest]: unit. It's like the fulcrum around which many of our laws operate. So where do we see single

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:11.840
[Guest]: women? It's really hard. There's no imagination of women outside either marriage or prostitution.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:17.520
[Guest]: These are the two institutions within which people can imagine. Even the state can imagine

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:25.600
[Guest]: women. And that is changing now because there are more single women, but they are marginalized

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:33.640
[Guest]: also. They don't have access to so many kinds of, you know, citizenship rights. Really,

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.720
[Guest]: it's hard to find a house. It's hard. It's so difficult to do so many things as a single

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:47.840
[Guest]: woman in this country. So there are, yeah, multiple issues working here that make progress

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:53.360
[Guest]: very difficult. So I agree with you there. But my hope is really that there are also

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.840
[Guest]: people who are resisting constantly.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:01.040
[Amit Varma]: So I have a complicated question. But before that, a quick observation that as far as the

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:07.240
[Amit Varma]: economy is concerned, I think one reason that people refuse to acknowledge or leave unseen

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:11.000
[Amit Varma]: what is happening to the economy is that so much of the damage has happened in the unorganized

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.200
[Amit Varma]: sector, especially demonetization onwards. There is absolutely no reckoning of that.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:21.160
[Amit Varma]: Earlier we used to kind of try and figure out what's happening in the informal sector,

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, with proxies and so on and so forth. But I think the damage after demon and the

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:30.920
[Amit Varma]: botched implementation of GST already was sending us on a downward trajectory, which

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:36.720
[Amit Varma]: of course COVID contributed to. And I'm really glad you brought up that question of laws

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:42.360
[Amit Varma]: and I'll cite a couple of other sort of similar laws with unintended consequences, including

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:47.560
[Amit Varma]: one from your book. And then we can, and then I'll segue to this sort of larger question

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:51.040
[Amit Varma]: I want to ask. And, you know, as far as similar laws are concerned, I remember when I was

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:56.000
[Amit Varma]: editing Pragati, the policy magazine, three or four years ago, I'd carried a piece where

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.960
[Amit Varma]: an economist, I think she'd written about how it actually hurt women in terms of getting

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:05.160
[Amit Varma]: jobs after the maternity law was passed, the maternity leave law was passed because the

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:11.080
[Amit Varma]: incentives for employers now changed drastically. So you had the classic example of a law with

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:17.200
[Amit Varma]: good intentions and, you know, bad outcomes. And, you know, similarly, I had once, you

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.400
[Amit Varma]: know, written a piece on child labor where everyone can agree, and I think I'd written

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:25.400
[Amit Varma]: this in 2007, but it was still hold true. It's a universal thing that everybody would

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.880
[Amit Varma]: agree that child labor is terrible, and you need to eliminate it. But how do you do it?

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:34.800
[Amit Varma]: You can't just pass a law and hope it goes away. And I cited this Oxfam study, where

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:40.520
[Amit Varma]: they spoke about how international outrage forced factories to lay off 30,000 child workers,

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:44.920
[Amit Varma]: and they followed these 30,000 child workers, many of them starved to death, many became

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:51.080
[Amit Varma]: prostitutes. Similarly, a 1995 UNICEF study described how a boycott of carpets made in

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.240
[Amit Varma]: Nepal using child labor, right? And you'd imagine that such a boycott is a good thing.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.960
[Amit Varma]: You're fighting child labor, but it led to between 5000 to 7000 Nepali girls turning

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:05.480
[Amit Varma]: to prostitution, because a better option was now denied to them. And similarly, in your

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:11.160
[Amit Varma]: book, you talk about the ban on dance bars, where you write to quote you, the ban allegedly

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:18.400
[Amit Varma]: left over 75,000 women without a job overnight, and 2500 establishments in the lurch. And

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:22.800
[Amit Varma]: later you add, you know, by the time it was going through the courts, you add, quote,

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.920
[Amit Varma]: bar dancers entered penury and were displaced, many moving to smaller towns, some pushed

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.680
[Amit Varma]: underground into sex work, reports occasionally came out of former bar girls taking their

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:38.200
[Amit Varma]: own life, stop code. And in all of these cases, you have people identifying what is what appears

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:43.460
[Amit Varma]: to be a great social problem, you have them with the best of intentions, framing laws

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:49.960
[Amit Varma]: to fight it. And then you have these unintended consequences, which hurt those who are supposed

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:55.120
[Amit Varma]: to help the most. And my larger question here is this, that I think that when it comes to

01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:00.140
[Amit Varma]: social movements and to activism, there is a danger that some of that activism becomes

01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:04.400
[Amit Varma]: activism for the sake of activism, in the sense that when I look around me, you are

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:08.280
[Amit Varma]: right that it's a wonderful thing that many more people including men are more aware of

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:13.880
[Amit Varma]: what feminism is and can identify it. But equally, you have a lot of posturing, including

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:20.000
[Amit Varma]: a lot of shrill posturing happening. On the one hand, which which would be social media,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.320
[Amit Varma]: which is not necessarily going in productive directions. And on the other hand, you know,

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.020
[Amit Varma]: you have activism, which is kind of going in these directions, where you have funding,

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.440
[Amit Varma]: you need to show you're doing something with it, or you've passed a law, you need to show

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:39.920
[Amit Varma]: a win, so to say, and you do that. And you may not always be aware of ground realities.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:43.360
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, Kavita Krishnan had done a four hour episode with me where she spoke

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:48.280
[Amit Varma]: eloquently on aspects of this, how, you know, so many feminists, you know, don't have that

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.160
[Amit Varma]: lived experience of working on the ground with victims and people who've actually gone

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:57.520
[Amit Varma]: through all of these, but they forge ahead anyway in search of these sort of wins and

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.680
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth. So now when you look at the movement, and you've been part of the

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:04.440
[Amit Varma]: movement for such a long time and been part of the grassroots and covered so many different

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:12.420
[Amit Varma]: aspects of it, what is your sense of this, especially in the last, say, 10 years, where

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:17.320
[Amit Varma]: social media now allows anyone to become an active to become a quote unquote, activist

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:22.760
[Amit Varma]: with very little effort, you can suddenly go on, and, you know, signal the greatest

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:27.200
[Amit Varma]: virtue by just typing a few words out on Twitter, you don't actually have to go out in the world

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:33.080
[Amit Varma]: and do anything and make people's life better. So is this something that you've seen? Is

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:38.320
[Amit Varma]: it hard to reconcile? Do you look around, for example, at your fellow travelers, and

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:41.720
[Amit Varma]: obviously, many of those fellow travelers would be like you who just want to make a

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:46.680
[Amit Varma]: change who know that they're playing the long game, it's a long haul, so on and so forth.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.040
[Amit Varma]: But it may not be that way for everyone.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:57.160
[Guest]: Alongside that, I'd add the problem of the NGO-ization of social movements. So there

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:05.360
[Guest]: is also that there, there's also the funding, you know, politics at play here, which is

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:13.800
[Guest]: that, you know, there is funding, it's become a sector like anything else, social change

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:20.160
[Guest]: is a sector now, as much as activism or a desire for change in that sense. Yeah, I feel

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:26.720
[Guest]: that despite, I agree that there is a lot of posturing, not, I don't think that's there

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:31.400
[Guest]: in institutional feminism, I think institutional feminism is beset by other problems related

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:39.240
[Guest]: to the NGO-ization of the sector. But in terms of woke feminism, you know, that kind of a

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:46.080
[Guest]: very superficial engagement with issues. I do agree. But I feel that this is a journey

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:50.480
[Guest]: that each individual goes through, honestly, and I've never, I've always felt people find

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.960
[Guest]: their own feminism, and they find it at a moment in time that is relevant to them. And

01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:01.040
[Guest]: it has to have, it has to make sense for them, right? There, it has to ultimately change

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:07.600
[Guest]: something in their life for it to have meaning. That's why I take the term feminist quite

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:14.480
[Guest]: lightly now. One doesn't, one knows that it's not actually very deep understanding of a

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:19.360
[Guest]: certain kind of scholarship around feminism that we're really looking at, or thinking

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:26.200
[Guest]: around feminism. So I do see, I understand what you're saying, but I feel some of these

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:34.160
[Guest]: debates that emerge. So even if it is, for example, the question of the crowdfunded,

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:42.080
[Guest]: the LOSHA, the list of sexual harassment in academia, the LOSHA, the first Me Too basically

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:47.680
[Guest]: in India. Correct, correct. I'm forgetting her name now, but the young woman who had

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:54.120
[Guest]: Raya Sarkar, it was the name of the young woman who had sort of brought, started that

01:11:54.120 --> 01:12:02.080
[Guest]: crowdfunded list. And so, you know, there will be many people who will sort of go along

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:10.040
[Guest]: with it, but it pointed to a real fault line in the movement, which is the question of

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:15.080
[Guest]: caste identity and really what the whole thing that, you know, Raya Sarkar herself being

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:23.720
[Guest]: a young Dalit feminist was really the list, in the list, most of them were upper caste

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:30.360
[Guest]: male academics who were accused. And, you know, there was a letter written by older

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:37.640
[Guest]: feminists challenging the mode of, you know, the way that it was just a public list without

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:45.320
[Guest]: due process. And younger feminists then wrote sort of, wrote a rebuttal against that saying

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:51.080
[Guest]: that look what due process has got us, it's brought us absolutely nothing. And so that

01:12:51.080 --> 01:13:00.360
[Guest]: led to what was a vicious sort of a moment. And, but it pointed for me at many fault lines

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:06.920
[Guest]: that we'd been ignoring, which is really the question of an intergenerational dialogue,

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:12.080
[Guest]: because I don't find that actually they were saying very different things. It's just this

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:16.720
[Guest]: one group had a faith in due process, one group did not have a faith in due process,

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:28.080
[Guest]: but it was caste in caste identity mold. And so it assumed a different shape and form.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:35.040
[Guest]: And the problem I feel is that we move too quickly from one eruption to the next. And

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:43.760
[Guest]: there's not enough time or space or dialogue, actually, a constructive, empathetic and compassionate

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:52.400
[Guest]: dialogue between groups to arrive at a more complete, you won't resolve it, right? You

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:59.160
[Guest]: won't resolve something that is so deep and fundamental, like caste identity and the experience

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:05.120
[Guest]: of being oppressed or being the oppressor or blind privilege and so on. You will not

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:12.640
[Guest]: resolve it, but you will shift something through dialogue if you give it some space. What I

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:19.280
[Guest]: find disturbing is that we quickly, this finishes and then we have, you know, question of, you

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:24.800
[Guest]: know, cis women versus trans women. I mean, there'll be a new debate that will emerge

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:31.320
[Guest]: and people will move so quickly from one to the other without actually having worked through

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:37.120
[Guest]: the important things that came up in that in the first issue to begin with.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:42.440
[Amit Varma]: Three things I'll kind of want to double click here on and one is that, you know, you pointed

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.400
[Amit Varma]: out that people make their own journey, which is, of course, true. You know, we all make

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.640
[Amit Varma]: mistakes in our youth. Sometimes you're impatient, sometimes you're impetuous. Sometimes we flit

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:54.120
[Amit Varma]: from idea to idea, approach to approach, we find out what works. But what people in our

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:59.280
[Amit Varma]: generation have done is that a lot of this has not been in public. A lot of this has

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.320
[Amit Varma]: been in private, where we have space to grow without having to take a position in public

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:08.520
[Amit Varma]: and without being scrutinized all the time. My worry today is that when a young 20 year

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:13.920
[Amit Varma]: old something spends two years taking particular positions, taking hardened lines, castigating

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.720
[Amit Varma]: others for not being pure enough, and so on and so forth, they themselves then get cast

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:24.560
[Amit Varma]: in that mold, as it were, and what they are at a particular point in time, they almost

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.320
[Amit Varma]: become that forever, because they've taken those public positions and they double down

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:32.960
[Amit Varma]: on it and they rationalize whatever holes they might be. Whereas in an earlier generation,

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:37.800
[Amit Varma]: you blunder from this end to that end, and you kind of, you know, you find your way around.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:43.320
[Amit Varma]: The other thing is that this added element of cast is really interesting to me because

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:49.360
[Amit Varma]: you brought it up also during when you're talking about these bands on dance bars, where

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:54.700
[Amit Varma]: you talk about how there is this movement from seasoned feminists who are objecting

01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:58.920
[Amit Varma]: to the band. And they are saying that look, all of these people involved are there of

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:03.840
[Amit Varma]: their own volition. They've consented to be there as it were, you are probably dispatching

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:08.160
[Amit Varma]: them to worse fates, which as you know, the excerpt I read out from your book shows did

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:13.720
[Amit Varma]: happen and therefore they are against the band. But then suddenly you have from the

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:18.920
[Amit Varma]: side Dalit feminists coming up and saying that, no, no, the band is good because understand

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:23.440
[Amit Varma]: that there are these structures and invariably and as you've pointed out throughout your

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:28.060
[Amit Varma]: book, there is a strong element of cast here as well. And invariably many of these sex

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:33.840
[Amit Varma]: workers are, you know, from the lower rungs over there and you have to take that into

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:39.200
[Amit Varma]: account. And there I think like my fundamental sympathy still lies with those who are opposing

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:45.040
[Amit Varma]: the band because it's a question of sort of means not ends that by taking away people's

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:50.000
[Amit Varma]: consent you can't possibly solve the problem that whereas I agree with the Dalit feminists

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:55.920
[Amit Varma]: about the structural issues, the issue becomes one of means of how do you address them? Is

01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:01.880
[Amit Varma]: this the way to address them? Will this have unintended consequences which take these already

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:06.880
[Amit Varma]: unprivileged people to an even worse place as we know happened, you know, but that's

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.420
[Amit Varma]: that's a different matter. It doesn't matter where one is on that. But does that then make

01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:19.620
[Amit Varma]: the task kind of harder where there are people coming up with entirely justified anger across

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:24.040
[Amit Varma]: all of these margins saying that, hey, you've ignored Dalits all this time or you ignore

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:28.880
[Amit Varma]: trans people all the time. And you can see where the anger is coming from. And obviously

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:32.800
[Amit Varma]: they have a point. But then the question becomes of how do you fight this beast that you are

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.560
[Amit Varma]: fighting and you have people within the mainstream feminist movement, institutional feminists

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:42.640
[Amit Varma]: perhaps like from the taking that race from you who have been fighting this for decades.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:47.440
[Amit Varma]: They know the pace of change. They know what works and what doesn't work. They know that,

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:52.180
[Amit Varma]: you know, unintended consequences exist for everything. And there are others in a hurry

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:58.040
[Amit Varma]: because the world is changing so fast. How does one sort of reconcile that think about

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:03.080
[Amit Varma]: this? Is there scope for dialogue? Just, you know, if an outsider was to see those battles

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:07.160
[Amit Varma]: that are happening within the feminist camp at the time of Lohsha, for example, it would

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:11.920
[Amit Varma]: just seem really toxic at one level, the anger and the sort of the infighting that is going

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.720
[Amit Varma]: on where basically you're on the same page.

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:22.240
[Guest]: Yeah, I think there was a sociologist Geeta Chaddha called it a feminist civil war, you

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:27.940
[Guest]: know, in that phase. And the first question you asked, you know, about getting typecast

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:32.900
[Guest]: in a sense, right, you'll always be the if you've said something ignorant,

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:37.040
[Amit Varma]: Not just that you'll be typecast, but you will become that person, you'll solidify yourself,

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.200
[Amit Varma]: you'll stop growing. Because once you've taken that strong position on Twitter, once you

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.200
[Amit Varma]: and your gang have cancelled somebody also from your gang for not being pure enough,

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:51.680
[Amit Varma]: right, then by solid by taking such hard public stands, you almost commit yourself to becoming

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.680
[Amit Varma]: that person. And you're less fluid in a sense, well, otherwise, you would have continued

01:18:55.680 --> 01:19:00.760
[Amit Varma]: to grow, go in different directions, and so on and so forth.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.760
[Guest]: I don't I actually don't agree with that. I think that, you know, we do that when we

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.880
[Guest]: write also, right. So if I look at some of something I would have written 15 years back,

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:14.880
[Guest]: I have a different position, say, from, from what I would have now and mannequin my book

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:20.880
[Guest]: on, which is on women in the modeling industry is an example of that. Because when I, before

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:26.360
[Guest]: I started doing my research on the fashion and modeling industry, I was one of the women

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:31.280
[Guest]: who was against beauty pageants, and I would protest and etc, etc. And by the end, when

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:36.240
[Guest]: I came out the other side, I had a different understanding and view on objectification

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:41.840
[Guest]: and commodification of women. So even when you're writing something, or, you know, you

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:47.600
[Guest]: commit to something and then you can you change, right? I mean, that's the journey of, of anything,

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:55.160
[Guest]: any person who's thinking and studying and or just living through through times. So I

01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:03.080
[Guest]: feel that the, you know, there is the danger I feel is that this leads to silence, right?

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:09.240
[Guest]: Those who do have good points to make and arguments to make, don't say anything, because

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:14.200
[Guest]: they don't want to be hounded. Because that's what it feels like at the end of the day,

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:22.840
[Guest]: right? It on Twitter and so on. It feels it's, it's, you feel wounded by the kind of animosity

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:29.160
[Guest]: and amplified sort of hatred that comes against you. And I think we're still working our way

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:35.000
[Guest]: through this. We don't know what, what will happen, you know, whether we will be able

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:42.400
[Guest]: to be resilient, resilient towards this and become the person who, you know, and stop

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.800
[Guest]: being identified as the person who once said that about that or something like that, you

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:53.560
[Guest]: know, JK Rowling, I don't know if she will ever be able to, to go back to that the standing

01:20:53.560 --> 01:21:01.000
[Guest]: that she had because of her comments. Because she's now identified as what they call a TERF

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:07.480
[Guest]: or a trans exclusionary feminist, radical feminist. So I hope we are, I hope this is

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:12.400
[Guest]: a phase and I hope we are able to actually see that people change, people learn, people

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:16.960
[Guest]: grow. I mean, you know, we don't know so many things. And that's what I would say even for

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:22.600
[Guest]: people who have been in this business of change for so long. There's so much they don't know

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:27.520
[Guest]: and they realize it every single day, you know, every single and I think it was in your

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:33.560
[Guest]: episode, for example, with Rukmini that you had done on where she talks about how these

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:38.760
[Guest]: laws are being used against young people who are eloping. And it's not just that. I mean,

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:45.920
[Guest]: many groups in the movement also have been doing studies and finding that even work like,

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.800
[Guest]: you know, the child marriage law, for example, is used in exactly the same way. It's actually

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:59.840
[Guest]: used by parents to bring back girls who have eloped or against, you know, against such

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:04.920
[Guest]: choice marriages, you know, as we say. So, I mean, every, I mean, there's learning happening

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:12.320
[Guest]: everywhere. Nobody knows enough, honestly. I feel the question of, you know, Dalit sex

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:20.640
[Guest]: work and the Dalit feminists. So, this was again, this is a light bulb moment when this

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:27.840
[Guest]: realization that actually Dalit feminists, and for me, it was a moment at, it was the

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:33.960
[Guest]: National Autonomous Women's Movement Conference that this happened. And I've documented it

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:37.960
[Guest]: in one of the books and there are several books actually that have documented that moment,

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:44.840
[Guest]: which is a walkout by Dalit feminists when some of the bar dancers were part of the conference

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:50.520
[Guest]: and they came in one of the evening shows, they came and they performed on stage. And

01:22:50.520 --> 01:23:01.000
[Guest]: that, and one of the sex workers rights movements, sort of leaders went and offered sort of did

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:13.080
[Guest]: a, you know, like you do in Shadis, you know, that kind of thing. And it just really started,

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:17.640
[Guest]: it pissed off a lot of people and it made it, already there was discomfort in the air

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:20.040
[Amit Varma]: because of the existing tension in the women's movement.

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.400
[Amit Varma]: But the Aarti kind of thing is a Brahmanical thing, right?

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.880
[Amit Varma]: No, it's with the money. It's like the...

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.520
[Amit Varma]: So, it's not got that connotation, the ritualistic connotation.

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:35.160
[Amit Varma]: It's an appreciation and you know, it's like a blessing.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:42.720
[Guest]: But it just visibilized the act of money, giving money for dancing, basically, right?

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:50.920
[Guest]: So it made, it was like in your face and that triggered, already there were debates, etc

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:56.960
[Guest]: happening, right? Because there are divisions within the movement, those who feel that sex

01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:02.960
[Guest]: work is labor versus those who feel that it is actually violence against women. But this

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.320
[Guest]: was like a very simplistic kind of understanding that was a legacy from the Western feminist

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:15.040
[Guest]: sex wars. And, you know, it had its own manifestation in the Indian context. But this was a new

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:22.320
[Guest]: element Dalit feminists saying that, look, this is caste based labor. Women in sex work

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:28.360
[Guest]: are predominantly Dalits and they are there because they are Dalits. And because it is

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:35.160
[Guest]: like manual scavenging or any other caste based occupation, would you be pro manual

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:41.760
[Guest]: scavenging? No, right? So then why are you pro bar dancing as livelihoods or sex work

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:48.560
[Guest]: as livelihoods? Because this is caste based labor. So this position was sort of, I think

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:54.080
[Guest]: it brought many feminists to a standstill because they hadn't seen it through that lens.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:25:00.800
[Guest]: And this is true for many things. Now we see it through the lens of caste that we have

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:06.080
[Guest]: not really looked at before. For example, violence against girls. There are so many

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:13.280
[Guest]: cases of violence of girls in rural India, especially that now we see as caste based

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:21.680
[Guest]: violence, not only as gender based violence. So they are acts which are, you know, targeted

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:28.440
[Guest]: at a certain caste. So it is, these are changing lenses, but the dialogue that is possible,

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:35.720
[Guest]: I mean, honestly, it's a dialogue that I think can only be addressed by sex workers themselves

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:42.040
[Guest]: speaking about their choices, right? I cannot speak for them. Nobody else can speak for

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:48.840
[Guest]: Dalit sex workers who can talk about very matter. And I've heard them say in the most

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:55.800
[Guest]: beautiful ways, matter of factly, how many of them arrive through coercion, through caste

01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:01.520
[Guest]: based exploitation and so on. And many of them don't. Many of them arrive there through

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.960
[Guest]: their own volition, their own journeys. It's only understandable in the context of their

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:13.960
[Guest]: own lives, in their life stories. So it is, I think, only through hearing voices of women

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:22.160
[Guest]: themselves, can we ever be convinced about things as, as emotional and as deep rooted

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:29.080
[Guest]: like child labor, or like sex work, you know, it's impossible otherwise, because we have

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:35.520
[Guest]: such fixed ideas of what is right and what's wrong around these things. Unless one hears

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:43.080
[Guest]: it from them, the people themselves, we're not going to be convinced.

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:46.880
[Amit Varma]: In fact, one of the things that makes Intimate City such a rich book is also that you have

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:51.000
[Amit Varma]: so many of these voices speaking in the book. And at one point, in fact, you write on this

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.280
[Amit Varma]: subject, rather than comparing sex work with manual scavenging or other forms of caste

01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:00.200
[Amit Varma]: based exploitation, sex workers themselves often articulate a closer connection to domestic

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:06.200
[Amit Varma]: labor, placing sex work on the continuum of work that housewives do. And we'll of course

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:11.880
[Amit Varma]: dive deep into this later. But first, I want to kind of double click on that phrase that

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:17.920
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned about NGO-ization. And in your chapter on Kamathipura also, you give different

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:21.880
[Amit Varma]: reasons for the decline of Kamathipura. Of course, one is just real estate pressures

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:26.520
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. Then there is a fear of AIDS and so on. You know, then there is a clientele

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:32.640
[Amit Varma]: changing to sort of a lower class of client, which has less money to pay for that. But

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:37.760
[Amit Varma]: you also sort of talk about the NGO-ization of Kamathipura there, for example, and you

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:43.480
[Amit Varma]: write, quote, this led to hordes of anti-trafficking and HIV AIDS prevention NGOs setting a base

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:48.240
[Amit Varma]: in the area and undertaking programs focused on service delivery and welfare. The joke

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.840
[Amit Varma]: goes that you will find as many health workers and researchers in this area as you will find

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:57.960
[Amit Varma]: sex workers, stop quote. Taking that as an aside and just diving deeper into your point

01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:02.640
[Amit Varma]: of NGO-ization. What did you mean by that? And what is the problem there? Like, I have

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:07.960
[Amit Varma]: obviously no familiarity with NGOs in this space. But the little familiarity I do see

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:14.720
[Amit Varma]: with NGOs in other spaces, my biggest sort of criticism is that when they begin, their

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:18.160
[Amit Varma]: incentives are that there's a problem in the real world, a social problem, and they want

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:23.600
[Amit Varma]: to solve it. But over time, funding becomes a main imperative. And therefore, the incentives

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:28.600
[Amit Varma]: are designed around the funding, they have to get the next round of funding, which therefore

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.960
[Amit Varma]: implies two things. And I'm talking about this in other fields, what I'm familiar with

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:37.280
[Amit Varma]: not your field at all. So and the fact that funding is a main imperative involves takes

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:41.440
[Amit Varma]: them in two directions. One, they have to paint the problem as worse than it actually

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:47.320
[Amit Varma]: is. And two, they have to show that they are making a difference of some sort or the other.

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:51.840
[Amit Varma]: Is that something that would carry through to the sort of NGOs that you've encountered

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:56.580
[Amit Varma]: in the field? And whether yes or no, you know, elaborate on NGO-ization? Because that's such

01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.080
[Amit Varma]: an interesting phrase.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:06.560
[Guest]: Yeah. Well, it's the, it refers to the broader context in which social work happens, or you

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:13.640
[Guest]: know, earlier, it used to be voluntary. But you cannot, you know, you can't expect people

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:19.040
[Guest]: to give their time without paying them also, right. So that's not so it's sort of a shift

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:29.760
[Guest]: from voluntary social work to professionalized services, right. So it's a, it's a, it's a

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:36.840
[Guest]: large shift. And it's, it has various elements to it. Funding is only one of the elements.

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:44.200
[Guest]: We know that NGOs through the pandemic, filled in the gaps where government has not, you

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:52.600
[Guest]: know, could not sort of do anything, or did not do anything. And it's true for all fields.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:58.320
[Guest]: Like I, I cannot imagine if there were no NGOs in many of the places I visit, what people

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:05.280
[Guest]: would do, honestly, there is such infrastructural neglect. Even if, you know, young people are

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:09.960
[Guest]: not going to schools or colleges, they are being, you know, through programs, they're

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:14.960
[Guest]: learning life skills, they're having opportunities to play sports, they're doing all kinds of

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:22.080
[Guest]: things that they would not otherwise. So I mean, this is in addition to I mean, a lot

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:28.160
[Guest]: of the NGOs that I have seen do a lot of perspective building. So really bringing people together

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:34.120
[Guest]: to make sense of their lives, to really improve the quality of people's lives. There are all

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:39.040
[Guest]: kinds of NGOs, of course, there are those that are very service delivery oriented. There

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:44.560
[Guest]: are two to facilitating, you know, access to your entitlements, helping you get on,

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:53.320
[Guest]: you know, your Aadhaar cards, and so on, or NREGA cards. There are those that really enable

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:59.640
[Guest]: people to join the panchayat, women to join the panchayat. So there are, you know, very

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:10.080
[Guest]: specific fields, I feel that we would be bereft without the kinds of contributions that NGOs

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:17.680
[Guest]: do, however, they are quite demonized. And that the history of that is, is really comes

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:24.680
[Guest]: from a long time back from the Congress period, actually, where there's a suspicion of foreign

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:30.080
[Guest]: funding, really supporting anti government activities, and so on. So that has that strain

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:37.160
[Guest]: has continued. I feel that the NGOization also means that there is a, you know, we have

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:45.320
[Guest]: social work schools, we have women's studies centers. Now, we have all kinds of interdisciplinary

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:52.720
[Guest]: centers that train people to work in the development sector. So it is an acknowledgement of the

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:59.840
[Guest]: lack of development. Actually, that's what the NGOization is a response to the entrenched

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:05.680
[Guest]: lack of development, which we have seen in our country and around the world. And the

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:11.920
[Guest]: fact that you need expertise to really handle this challenge, the massiveness of this challenge,

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:20.120
[Guest]: right. So which is why you have developmental professionals now, who are parts of NGOs.

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:24.800
[Guest]: Maybe they should not be called NGOs, maybe they should be called the social sector or

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:33.600
[Guest]: you know, and now increasingly there are models of, you know, social enterprise, for example.

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:39.560
[Guest]: There are models in which there are for profit companies who are doing social oriented, social

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:45.440
[Guest]: change oriented work. So there are shifts happening there as well. I feel that this

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:50.520
[Guest]: idea of having to have funding. Well, what else if you're a non-profit, where will you

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:58.600
[Guest]: get the funds from? It's like, it's a vicious cycle, right? How will you pay your staff?

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:05.920
[Guest]: Why should staff work for such low salaries? And they are really low. I mean, I don't know

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:12.480
[Guest]: how people survive on these salaries and funding organizations often don't pay for and it's

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:18.960
[Guest]: not sustainable because funding cycles are in small, small sort of two-year, three-year

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:26.440
[Guest]: or whatever, sometimes yearly. So you cannot have long-term employment. So in a sense there

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:31.440
[Guest]: is an, and you spoke about the informal sector, but what I was thinking about is that the

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:36.560
[Guest]: informalization of every sector has happened. It is not just the informal sector, the corporate

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:41.220
[Guest]: sector, there are jobs which are not permanent jobs anymore. We don't have the idea of permanent.

01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:46.920
[Guest]: Everything is a temp job, honestly. Everything is contract based. So there is an informalization

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:51.120
[Guest]: across the board, whether it's the corporate sector, whether it's the NGO sector. So there

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:58.400
[Guest]: is an informalization that exists in the sector. But these are problems I feel which are not

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:03.720
[Guest]: only in the NGO sector. You know, they are really across the board. And even if we look

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:10.020
[Guest]: at the gig economy and the kind of low pay that exists, the gig economy has emerged actually

01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:16.880
[Guest]: because of this informalization of the corporate sector. So there is a broader, I mean, economists

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:24.280
[Guest]: must be looking at this. I don't know, but the NGOization is something that I do, I agree

01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:32.280
[Guest]: that NGOs struggle with because it's pushed them to a corner where yes, they have to support

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:36.760
[Guest]: the staff that they have. They cannot withdraw from programs or interventions they have started

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:41.520
[Guest]: on the ground, right? Because that's often the only thing that exists in rural areas,

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:46.440
[Guest]: in the areas and communities they work in. They are the ones people turn to for whatever

01:34:46.440 --> 01:35:00.520
[Guest]: violence, disenfranchisement that they face. So I mean, it seems like unless, you know,

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:07.120
[Guest]: unless they work together to really push for state accountability, to have systems that

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:11.720
[Guest]: work better. There are many systems that work. There are many systems that are pushed to

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:16.840
[Guest]: work and depends, it differs from state to state, district to district. I mean, you know,

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:21.360
[Guest]: if the collector is good and so on, it's the same old story, right? Many changes happen

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:29.600
[Guest]: in districts quickly. But until those systemic changes happen, we're not going to resolve

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:35.360
[Guest]: in a sense this problem. The issue is also that the state and NGOs are often at the local

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.200
[Guest]: level, they work together closely, actually, because they, the state actually can't do

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:45.960
[Guest]: without NGOs in most places. But at the macro level, there is this bit of a standoff and

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.120
[Guest]: so it's actually very nuanced and different at different levels.

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:56.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I didn't mean to imply for a moment that NGOs are a bad thing. I mean,

01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:00.160
[Amit Varma]: as you would have heard in my episode with Kavita, which just released yesterday, which

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:07.240
[Amit Varma]: is why you mentioned it. You know, I'm for anything that civil society does that involves

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.960
[Amit Varma]: voluntary action. It could be through the mechanism of free markets, it could be through

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:17.320
[Amit Varma]: NGOs. The fact is, the state most often is going to let us down. So, you know, whatever

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:23.580
[Amit Varma]: civil society does is great and NGOs are one way. My sort of mention of the imperatives

01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:28.640
[Amit Varma]: of funding and the incentives that they lead to was not to imply something malign but to

01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:33.760
[Amit Varma]: point to something tragic, that therefore you get imprisoned by those imperatives and

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:40.200
[Amit Varma]: they can divert you from whatever your core direction is. Like what would happen for example,

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:45.200
[Amit Varma]: in a marketplace, in a free marketplace where there is no cronyism, is that a company can

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:51.000
[Amit Varma]: only make a profit by fulfilling the need of whoever its customers are. Therefore, it

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.400
[Amit Varma]: is making people in society better off and that's the only way to make money and therefore

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.960
[Amit Varma]: there I see the incentives are completely aligned. In the social sector, it's complicated

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:03.560
[Amit Varma]: because it doesn't work like that. And so this is not something I have an answer to,

01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:08.800
[Amit Varma]: but this is something that can, I sense and with NGOs that I'm familiar with in other

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.960
[Amit Varma]: fields and I won't take names, I see this as a problem that they get into this area

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:17.800
[Amit Varma]: of ticking boxes, that once they become big, like any big company does, they'll have these

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.680
[Amit Varma]: departments, they'll do separate things, each department will take boxes, they'll do this

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:26.800
[Amit Varma]: much on social media, they'll have an Instagram page, they'll do this outreach and so on and

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:31.600
[Amit Varma]: so forth. But in the end, no one's really passionate anymore about, you know, what the

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:35.120
[Amit Varma]: core cause is, that's been forgotten, the founders have probably gone somewhere else

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:40.320
[Amit Varma]: and I kind of see that happening. But otherwise, I totally agree with you, we would be bereft

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:43.560
[Amit Varma]: without them as we would be bereft if people in civil society didn't help each other, that's

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:50.440
[Guest]: what we do. Yeah, I mean, I think what you're referring to is actually bureaucracy. It's

01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:54.920
[Guest]: that we, you know, and it's a way of working that we know, right? So our NGOs are also

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:59.480
[Guest]: just learning from people around us, right? So the institutions and organizations that

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:06.640
[Guest]: we create are not, you know, those fun organizations. I mean, there was a time when there were collectives,

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:12.640
[Guest]: they were small, many of them, you're right, when an organization grows to a certain size,

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:17.960
[Guest]: it becomes a beast of its own, right? And this is the issue with startups as well, I

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:24.400
[Guest]: would say, right? So this is an institutional problem, I feel that this is what happens

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:29.160
[Guest]: when you create an institution, and you have to keep on running it, running it, running

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:37.640
[Guest]: it. And I feel like the problem is that our template is that of a bureaucratic template

01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:44.280
[Guest]: with different departments, this, that and the other. I wonder if we completely, you

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:49.200
[Guest]: know, like, scrapped it all to the ground, and we just gave it to a bunch of young people

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:57.360
[Guest]: and said, here, you do what you want with it. This is the heart. This was the vision

01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:03.760
[Guest]: that we had. And can you, you do what you want with it, you can change, you can have

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:11.840
[Guest]: your own vision, you know, which is why I mean, this question of diversity in, in hiring,

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:19.600
[Guest]: why is it why I feel it's so important, it is important to have Dalits, Muslims, trans

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:27.800
[Guest]: people, young people, people with disabilities, all kinds of really, you know, groups represented

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.360
[Guest]: in an organization, because they bring different visions, and they bring different energies,

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:39.760
[Guest]: of course. But something holds us back. And I hear you on that, you know, that it becomes

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:46.800
[Guest]: something like a stone around your neck, that we are not able to move away from old ways

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:53.800
[Guest]: of building institutions and tending to them. And, you know, so that's the, I agree with

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:54.800
[Amit Varma]: you that.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:59.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, and I agree with you on the diversity bit in the sense that I keep citing these

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:03.800
[Amit Varma]: studies, I first learned about them from Philip Tetlock's book, super forecasting, we showed

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:09.440
[Amit Varma]: that for any firm, the single biggest factor in good decision making is not intelligence,

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.060
[Amit Varma]: however, you measure it or education or whatever it is diversity, the more diverse a group

01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:17.560
[Amit Varma]: you have, the better decisions you'll get. And that's actually commonsensical. And I

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:21.560
[Amit Varma]: remember another study a while back, I don't, I don't remember where I saw this. But if

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:25.280
[Amit Varma]: I find it, I'll link it in the show notes, we showed that companies that are less diverse

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:31.000
[Amit Varma]: actually do worse in the US, this was purely in a US context, they just perform worse in

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.320
[Amit Varma]: the marketplace, which you would expect from the previous study, because hey, after all,

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:39.000
[Amit Varma]: you're taking worse decisions. So I think diversity is something that can come about

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:45.800
[Amit Varma]: that should come about from companies themselves in a voluntary way in their own self interest.

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:51.880
[Amit Varma]: And you know, leaving sort of that aside, you know, before we start talking about your

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:55.640
[Amit Varma]: book, which we'll do after the break, I want to kind of go back on the biographical journey

01:40:55.640 --> 01:41:00.120
[Amit Varma]: that you know, you've sort of your third eye has opened, or you've had your light bulb

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:05.080
[Amit Varma]: moments and you've decided this is what I want to do. At this point in time, in the

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:10.480
[Amit Varma]: mid 90s, who are your models? Who are you looking at? Like I can imagine it being easy

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:15.680
[Amit Varma]: for you to find intellectual models today, great books to read, we show you the way forward

01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:21.160
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth. You can go on YouTube and watch a bazaar discussions between people

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:25.280
[Amit Varma]: who have achieved a lot in these fields. In the mid 90s, you don't really have all that

01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:30.800
[Amit Varma]: and I would assume that some influences would perhaps be local ones, people you see in action,

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:37.280
[Amit Varma]: who you find inspiring. So both in terms of intellectual frameworks, which could be books,

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:42.320
[Amit Varma]: which could be whatever, and in terms of people who you look at and say that I want to live

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:45.480
[Amit Varma]: a life like that, I want to do things like that, that's the kind of person I want to

01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:50.240
[Amit Varma]: be. So who were your models in that sense? And it's almost ironic, I'm asking a question

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:55.480
[Amit Varma]: about models, given that your first book was mannequins.

01:41:55.480 --> 01:42:02.200
[Guest]: So in the 90s, I mean, I would really say books, honestly, there was still old feminist

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:07.840
[Guest]: classics, because I was encountering feminism for the first time. And that time I was, I

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:13.640
[Guest]: mean, everybody in the movement used to smoke. So you know, the smokers area was near the

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:20.760
[Guest]: racks of the library, the library, basically, which was in the outdoors area. And so, you

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:27.720
[Guest]: know, smoking breaks would be like, going up and down the book rack and really sort

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:35.520
[Guest]: of really getting a sense of this ocean of literature, you know, feminist classics, which

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:42.160
[Guest]: were around me. And so really reading those kinds of books, I would say Betty Friedan,

01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:46.600
[Guest]: Betty Friedan's book, especially her essay, The Problem with No Name, where she talks

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:55.140
[Guest]: about housewifery in America, and how women would go to sleep at night after doing the

01:42:55.140 --> 01:43:00.480
[Guest]: day of, you know, taking their kids to school and, you know, preparing their husband's meals

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:05.160
[Guest]: and lying in bed at night and thinking, is this it? Is this the end of the dream? And,

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:09.800
[Guest]: you know, the way she put it, what really was remarkable, the way that she had written

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:16.560
[Guest]: it also. So I think books were very significant, especially feminist classics, I think, around

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:23.000
[Guest]: me, I had feminist greats at that time, Kamla Basin very much, you know, was a part of which

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.280
[Guest]: was one of the founders of Jaggery, there were many others, Abha Bhaiya, there were

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:37.480
[Guest]: many who I would say, influenced my journey. But other than that, I think it was actually

01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:43.840
[Guest]: honestly a sense of just community friendships that you had. And, you know, you saw everybody

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:50.160
[Guest]: struggling. I mean, you met people who had run away from home, who had tried to create

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:56.480
[Guest]: their own lives, you, I did casework where I, where I learned that I'm not cut out for

01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:02.880
[Guest]: casework. So one of my first tasks was actually to help, you know, dowry victims in Safdarjung

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:09.080
[Guest]: Burns Ward, Safdarjung Hospital Burns Ward to actually file their police complaints.

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:16.360
[Guest]: And in another situation, I was, I would go every Tuesday to Dakshinpuri, which was an

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:20.560
[Guest]: urban slum. And there used to be a single women's group there. And they used to have

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:26.840
[Guest]: their meetings on Tuesday nights, where women would come together to talk about their, the

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:31.800
[Guest]: problems and they would resolve cases that had come to them and so on. So I would spend

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:37.560
[Guest]: the night in Dakshinpuri at my colleague's house. And so those kinds of everyday experiences,

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:49.000
[Guest]: I would say was really the, creates that emotional, very strong emotional tapestry, you know,

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:56.960
[Guest]: on which you then start sort of exploring things and you start experiencing what other

01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:02.080
[Guest]: people are experiencing, you know, some empathy, wires of empathy sort of open up and you're

01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:10.120
[Guest]: able to connect to other people through that. So I think that and I think just the practice

01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:17.840
[Guest]: of research, honestly. So for me, that became a very alive wire to connect to other people's

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:26.760
[Guest]: lives, to other conceptual frameworks. And it became sort of a feed, feeding system for

01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:35.760
[Guest]: me to grow. And yeah, I'm trying to think if there were any other people. But no, I

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:42.960
[Guest]: don't think I've been a very role model oriented person, much more drawn to ideas and conceptual

01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:48.280
[Guest]: frameworks than anything else.

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:55.080
[Amit Varma]: And are there any more light bulb moments for yourself that you can remember something

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:59.920
[Amit Varma]: that you believe then which you suddenly stop believing because something went off in your

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:00.920
[Guest]: head?

01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:04.720
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, as you were saying light bulb moment, I actually remember that experience.

01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:14.520
[Guest]: And this is one of my first experiences with sex workers. It was a training in Khandala

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:23.040
[Guest]: with the sex workers group. And they were an anti-trafficking group, actually. And it

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:28.800
[Guest]: was a group of sex workers from there. And I'd gone again, I was not the main trainer,

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:33.760
[Guest]: I was just the assistant, I was going to write the report, etc. And Abha was the main trainer.

01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:39.360
[Guest]: And there you have an exercise, you know, where you, it's a common exercise in feminist

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:44.000
[Guest]: trainings, which is called the pleasure and pain exercise. Basically, you have this massive,

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:49.720
[Guest]: you stick two sheets of chart paper together, and one of the women will lay down on it and

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:54.520
[Guest]: we'll draw her silhouette, we'll draw around her. Someone will draw and leads to a lot

01:46:54.520 --> 01:47:01.160
[Guest]: of giggling because you know, she's getting tickled and all of that. And then once her

01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:06.440
[Guest]: map is sort of drawn on the sheet, she'll get up and everybody will be given two pens.

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:14.320
[Guest]: And it's one, so if it's blue and red, blue will be points of pain, and red, you mark

01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:20.120
[Guest]: points of pleasure on that body map. So everybody will think about it and then they'll mark

01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:26.480
[Guest]: okay, this is a point of pleasure on my body, this is a point of pain on my body. And the

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:32.200
[Guest]: intention is actually to use this exercise and entry point to talk about health, to talk

01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:38.560
[Guest]: about really the body, awareness of the body, and so on, and open up, you know, that sort

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:45.040
[Guest]: of conversation. And when we did this exercise over there with the sex workers, I don't know

01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:51.200
[Guest]: what I had imagined, I had imagined that maybe they will know much more about their bodies.

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:57.640
[Guest]: But the responses were exactly the same as any other rural women, you know, then I realized

01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:03.120
[Guest]: that they know as little about their body and health, sexual health, and so on as anyone

01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:10.680
[Guest]: else. And so for me, that was a light bulb moment about my own presumptions, as well

01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:18.040
[Guest]: as the fact that, hey, hold on, stop looking at them as sex workers. These are single women,

01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:24.160
[Guest]: they are poor women, they are single mothers, many of them are Dalit women, you have to

01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:31.320
[Guest]: see them, you know, beyond this identity that you've come in with as sex workers. And of

01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:37.880
[Guest]: course, there's the realization that the prejudices we carry with us, you know, it was a stupid

01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:44.520
[Guest]: assumption to think that they would know more about their body than any other women.

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:53.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and there's another on the same themes, this profound passage from your book, again,

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:59.200
[Amit Varma]: which points to one of those possible light bulb moments for others where you write, quote,

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:03.240
[Amit Varma]: take for example, this comment by a well known porn star in Wendy Chapkis's book, Life Sex

01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:08.280
[Amit Varma]: Acts, which significantly shifted my own view of sex work. And now the quote begins, work

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:13.160
[Amit Varma]: is work, you have good days and bad days. But my worst day at work is still better than

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:18.360
[Amit Varma]: the best day selling shoes at Kinney's, stop quote, and which is again, so sort of thought

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:22.280
[Amit Varma]: provoking in different ways. And we'll come back to that and to the book after a quick

01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:29.800
[Amit Varma]: commercial break. Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:34.600
[Amit Varma]: many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:40.000
[Amit Varma]: 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:46.160
[Amit Varma]: me and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:50.600
[Amit Varma]: was forced to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things.

01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:55.760
[Amit Varma]: Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it.

01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:00.680
[Amit Varma]: Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter

[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:36.120
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Manjuma Bhattacharya and we've

01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:40.760
[Amit Varma]: kind of gone through a significant chunk of your personal journey. But before we talk

01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:45.600
[Amit Varma]: about your book Intimacy, which I want to talk about at some length because I loved

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:52.680
[Amit Varma]: it so much and it's got so much in it that is thought provoking. I want to continue with

01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:57.440
[Amit Varma]: the personal journey a bit to take you to your first book Mannequin. How did that sort

01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:02.260
[Amit Varma]: of come about? Like take me through then. I imagine it's in the mid 90s, the second

01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:07.480
[Amit Varma]: half of the 90s that you got into activism and feminism and so on and so forth. So what

01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:12.120
[Amit Varma]: was that journey like from reaching a point where you said that, okay, one, I will write

01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:16.480
[Amit Varma]: a book and two, I will write a book about this.

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:25.200
[Guest]: That book came out of my PhD. So it was actually the PhD that that I did on. So the intention

01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:30.000
[Guest]: for the PhD was really to look at globalization, women and work. Because by now I'd been working

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:37.360
[Guest]: with Chaguri, I would go to sort of college in the mornings, I was doing my MA in sociology

01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:43.320
[Guest]: at JNU and then I would go to work in the afternoons at Chaguri. So that was sort of

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:52.960
[Guest]: the rhythm of life. I think in that period, I was working a lot on migration and trafficking

01:51:52.960 --> 01:52:00.960
[Guest]: at that time, which was really trying to understand whether, you know, really trying to understand

01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:06.960
[Guest]: how trafficking was defined, like was it really, women were moving of their own volition, right?

01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:12.160
[Guest]: And they were entering into very unsafe migrations that ultimately ended up being trafficking

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:19.080
[Guest]: in a sense into various kinds of labor, sex work, domestic work, factory work, and so

01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:26.120
[Guest]: on, different kinds of labor. So my interest in women and labor was increasing. And I wanted

01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:30.960
[Guest]: to study that. I wanted to actually study what kinds of work women were doing in post

01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:36.560
[Guest]: globalization India. For example, there were a lot of women who were coming to work in

01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:43.600
[Guest]: export processing zones. It was a huge chunk of young women coming to work in factories

01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:48.120
[Guest]: in export processing zones. There were young women coming from say Jharkhand, etc, to work

01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:52.960
[Guest]: as live in domestic help in Delhi. So there were flows that were happening and there were

01:52:52.960 --> 01:53:00.520
[Guest]: a lot of young women who were participating in beauty pageants and who were becoming models.

01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:05.960
[Guest]: So I think, you know, I wanted to sort of look at these various kinds of flows that

01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:14.400
[Guest]: were happening. And my committee at JNU said it was too much. So I had to choose one. I

01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:20.120
[Guest]: chose women in the modeling industry, finally, as the area I wanted to study because there

01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:31.120
[Guest]: was nothing on it. It was actually completely barren in that sense, academically. And there

01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:38.360
[Guest]: was also an interesting sort of moment, right? Because there was the anti-beauty pageant

01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:45.280
[Guest]: rallies, etc, that had taken place. 1996, when I had joined was when the Miss World

01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:49.720
[Guest]: beauty pageant in Bangalore had seen all these protests. And even though there were three

01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:56.280
[Guest]: different kinds of streams of protest, there was the left protesting against globalization

01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:03.800
[Guest]: primarily, which was, I mean, they were like they protested Kentucky Fried Chicken, they

01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:10.240
[Guest]: were protesting the Miss World pageant. Then you had the right wing, they were protesting

01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:14.640
[Guest]: degradation of Indian culture, breakdown of Indian culture, that kind of thing. And then

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:20.760
[Guest]: the third stream was actually feminists who were objecting to the commodification of women

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:28.640
[Guest]: and they were objecting. So their slogan was, khaane ko nahi roti, dhoondne chale beauty.

01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:32.800
[Guest]: So their issue was that what are the priorities of the government? You know, why is the state

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:36.680
[Guest]: government supporting this and putting money into this, whereas they should be focusing

01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:44.560
[Guest]: on other things and the concern that the middle class did not have a sense of, you know, looking

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:50.760
[Guest]: good was not a priority, etc. And that this would change that. This would bring, open

01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:56.160
[Guest]: up India as a market for beauty and Indian women would be targets of that market, which

01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:02.840
[Guest]: all did happen. But these three different nuanced positions was all brushed, it was

01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:11.680
[Guest]: all made into one broad protest, which was against, actually, it was framed as a protest

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:17.120
[Guest]: against the bikini, bikini round. And the bikini round was moved to the seashells and,

01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:21.880
[Guest]: you know, things continued sort of thing. But for the women's movement, it was an important

01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:28.560
[Guest]: turning point because it made them really reflect on this idea of beauty and so on.

01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:33.600
[Guest]: So I think I was, I joined the movement exactly as you said at that time, when in the shadow

01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:40.040
[Guest]: of this kind of tension, where there were the women inside the, you know, who were participating

01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:44.480
[Guest]: in the patent and there were the women outside who were protesting the patent and I was with

01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:52.960
[Guest]: organizations who have been protesting outside. So for me also, it was a question in my mind,

01:55:52.960 --> 01:56:00.480
[Guest]: why would women participate in something that is not in their interest, in a sense, right?

01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:05.600
[Guest]: So that was my research question. And when you're doing research, you have to, I mean,

01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:11.560
[Guest]: it is hard to actually arrive at a good research question. And for me, this was the one that

01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:18.760
[Guest]: made sense for me. So with this research question, I sort of entered the PhD. So that was the

01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:27.240
[Guest]: PhD. The book came at another point in time, actually, when I had moved from Delhi to here

01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:32.280
[Guest]: to Bombay. And I mean, I had always wanted to write a book, I'd been recommended even

01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:39.080
[Guest]: by the examiners that this should be a book, etc. But then I got, I finally got this amazing

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:44.720
[Guest]: grant from the New India Foundation. It was a fellowship that sort of gives you a salary

01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:52.080
[Guest]: for a year to sit and write a book. This is 2009. I'm talking about 2009, 10, something

01:56:52.080 --> 01:57:01.080
[Guest]: like that. And that's when I realized, okay, I can actually take time, I took a small office

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:08.200
[Guest]: and I shared it with someone with another colleague who was a consultant. And that's

01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:13.720
[Guest]: when I actually started writing the book. And I just had my second child then. And so

01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:19.800
[Guest]: I was, I really needed a space where I could go and write. And I realized when I thought,

01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:25.560
[Guest]: okay, one year, that's good enough, you know, I already have a written PhD. But then when

01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:31.000
[Guest]: I started, I realized that, okay, I cannot use a single word from the PhD, I have to

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.040
[Guest]: rewrite everything from scratch. When you're writing a PhD, you're writing for people who

01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:40.200
[Guest]: know more than you about a subject. When you're writing for the layperson, you're writing

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:45.920
[Guest]: for someone who knows nothing about that issue, actually, you have to assume. It was a completely

01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:49.920
[Guest]: different, it took me six months to realize that actually what I had was unusable, I'd

01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:55.000
[Guest]: have to start again. And that's when I then I started writing in a different way using

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:02.200
[Guest]: a different sort of craft, in a sense, you know, and really, and by then I had learned

01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:07.560
[Guest]: a little bit how to write for a lay audience. Because when I moved to Bombay, I came here

01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:11.320
[Guest]: without, I mean, you know, if you don't know Marathi, it's very difficult to work at the

01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:15.880
[Guest]: community level. So I was doing consultancies, etc. But one of the things I was doing was

01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:23.200
[Guest]: writing. And I was writing, I was lucky that Nonita Kalra at Elle, who was the editor of

01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:29.760
[Guest]: Elle at that time, Satya Saran, who was then doing a magazine called Me for DNA. And Nina

01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:36.080
[Guest]: Martiris, who was with the Sunday Times, Times of India, you know, they would, they gave

01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:42.600
[Guest]: me work, I mean, they gave me opportunities to write pieces that were based in research,

01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:47.560
[Guest]: but for a lay audience. So then I had, I was developing a practice of writing for a lay

01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:56.680
[Guest]: audience. So thanks to that, I had, I had some, I had started a journey. And so then

01:58:56.680 --> 01:59:00.960
[Guest]: I've, you know, that book took a long time, I mean, Mannequin took a long time to write,

01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:05.520
[Guest]: because it wasn't just, I wasn't only doing that, I was doing so many things, I was, you

01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:11.920
[Guest]: know, raising kids, I was finding work, I was all those kinds of things. So that year

01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:19.500
[Guest]: of fellowship was very important. But then there are other sort of practical life coming

01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:25.200
[Guest]: in the way kind of situations also, which meant that it only was published in 2018,

01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:32.760
[Guest]: which is like nine years later. And two of those were with, when it was sort of with

01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:40.400
[Guest]: another, another publishing house, and just sort of lay there, it didn't really move,

01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:46.200
[Guest]: which is when I withdrew it from there. But there are other things that happened that

01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:53.120
[Guest]: made the book really come alive. For example, motivation by Jerry Pinto, who I met through

01:59:53.120 --> 02:00:01.520
[Guest]: my friend and colleague, Bishaka Dutta, who insisted that I write 1000 words a week, I

02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:06.320
[Guest]: think, and send it to him. Whether he read it or not, I don't know. But every week I

02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:13.600
[Guest]: was supposed to send him 1000 words. And that made me, that pushed me to actually develop

02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:20.120
[Guest]: a practice of writing and trot out that first draft, which is the most, it's the hardest

02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:24.720
[Guest]: thing to have that first draft, then you can keep shaping it and, you know, crafting it

02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:34.560
[Guest]: and, and that's the bit I love. But that horrible first draft was really thanks to Jerry's,

02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:42.360
[Guest]: you know, insistence. And so anyway, these are the sort of nitty gritties. But that's

02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:48.480
[Guest]: how that particular book came about. And I think those nine years were important, because

02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:54.200
[Guest]: I initially I started out writing a book about women working in the modeling industry. By

02:00:54.200 --> 02:01:01.160
[Guest]: the end of it, it was a book about fashion and feminism. So the aboutness of that book

02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:08.040
[Guest]: changed as I kept thinking about it, and sort of packing it like, you know, very long, dumb

02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:15.320
[Guest]: biryani kind of thing, you know, it just got it changed in flavor. And I'm, I'm so glad

02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:21.120
[Guest]: it did, you know. And it was also one of those moments, you know, I think I went to the loo

02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:26.920
[Guest]: and I sat down and I was like, it just came to me after all those years that oh my god,

02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:35.400
[Guest]: my book is about me and as most books are, but it's really about me and my journey in

02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:45.280
[Guest]: fashion and feminism. And it is about my changed thinking about these things.

02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:49.000
[Amit Varma]: There's a bunch of places I want to dive in here. And it's interesting, you said that

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.360
[Amit Varma]: the first draft was the hardest and the rest, like one of the blurbs on your book I noticed

02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:59.400
[Amit Varma]: was by Sonia Falero, a good friend of mine, and you know her as well, I'm guessing, right?

02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:04.360
[Amit Varma]: So you know, she'd written Beautiful Thing, which was on the bar dancers of Mumbai. And

02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:08.320
[Amit Varma]: I remember that she wrote some four or five drafts of that, and I saw all of them and

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:11.960
[Amit Varma]: they were all completely different from each other. So it's not like she's done one draft

02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:16.320
[Amit Varma]: and she's, you know, moved paras around and cut things here and there. She just wrote

02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:21.080
[Amit Varma]: every draft from scratch, your main characters change, they were completely different. It

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:26.640
[Amit Varma]: was just an insane kind of work ethic, which I can't quite imagine. And that's sort of

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:31.120
[Amit Varma]: my next question to you. Like many years back, a writer called Mason Curry came out with

02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:36.000
[Amit Varma]: a book called Daily Rituals, and got a tremendous amount of flack because what he covered in

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:42.200
[Amit Varma]: it was a habits of artists and writers, but all of them were male. And the criticism correctly

02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:46.760
[Amit Varma]: was that, listen, there's a different kind of privilege at play here because many men

02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:50.600
[Amit Varma]: are able to shut themselves in a room for four hours in a day and say, don't disturb

02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:55.840
[Amit Varma]: me and do their thing. But women don't really work like that. And then Curry to his credit

02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:00.400
[Amit Varma]: came out with another book called Daily Rituals, Women at Work. What was it like for you? Because

02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:05.120
[Amit Varma]: you've got a couple of kids, you've got guessing your consultancy or daytime gig, whatever

02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:10.160
[Amit Varma]: it is, plus you're writing articles for all of these people. And you're trying to write

02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:14.560
[Amit Varma]: this book 1000 words a week at a time and got Del Sherry Pinto for motivating you to

02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:20.080
[Amit Varma]: do this. So what, how were your processes like? How would you manage to kind of get

02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:24.160
[Amit Varma]: that mind space where you can sit down and actually get some writing done?

02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:31.000
[Guest]: Both my husband and I, our writing happened at the dining table primarily. I mean, that's

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:38.160
[Guest]: just the way it was. I, you know, it's a luxury to imagine that one can go away somewhere

02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:47.120
[Guest]: and write, etc, etc. I will say that it happened only because of the kindness of family, friends,

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:52.080
[Guest]: help and so on. So the reality is that, you know, like even when I went for a writing

02:03:52.080 --> 02:04:01.320
[Guest]: workshop as late as 2016, my in-laws came and, you know, spent two weeks, you know,

02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:08.320
[Guest]: with my kids, so I could go. Even when I was doing my PhD, my mother came and stayed for

02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:15.480
[Guest]: two months to sort of look after my daughter while I would go to Teen Murthy in the day

02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:23.640
[Guest]: and work on my PhD. So finding a space has always been very hard and which is why the

02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:28.080
[Guest]: grant from New India, New India Foundation was so important and that office was so important

02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:34.520
[Guest]: even for just for that one year. So it's, it's extremely challenging and it's not just

02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:41.360
[Guest]: male writers. I think male anthropologists and sociologists, you know, this idea of that

02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:46.960
[Guest]: people can go away for a year and nobody will need them. They can go off to a village and

02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:52.640
[Guest]: do their research and, you know, come back with this genius piece of work. It's like

02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:57.440
[Guest]: quite, it's so gendered, right? Because can you, I can't imagine being away from home

02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:05.800
[Guest]: like, you know, for more than a certain period of time, with no doorbells to answer, etc,

02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:13.440
[Guest]: it's, it has been very hard. And it's, it has been at the cost of many things, a very

02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:18.000
[Guest]: untidy house, you know, really not really caring at some point, you have to drop the

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:29.040
[Guest]: ball on many things, you can't be a super woman. I also realized it's important to,

02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:34.480
[Guest]: to really be honest with everyone that, you know, I have, this is important to me, I want

02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:39.200
[Guest]: to do this. Everybody understands and appreciates that. I think, you know, I have clear channels

02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:45.240
[Guest]: of communication with everyone, including my partner, Saurabh, who's very, who is completely,

02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:56.040
[Guest]: you know, full participant in house care. And I wonder how it is for those who have

02:05:56.040 --> 02:06:04.320
[Guest]: to do everything without the sharing that is possible or needs to happen for real work

02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:14.960
[Guest]: to emerge. I don't know if these books would have been better off if I had gone away somewhere.

02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:22.720
[Guest]: And I did do a workshop for two weeks, where I went to Chamonix, where I was telling you

02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:26.400
[Guest]: about that, you know, for two weeks, I did this writing workshop, and I've never gone

02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:33.520
[Guest]: for a workshop before. But I gave myself permission. And I said, Look, I'm going to, I can do it,

02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:37.080
[Guest]: you know, I don't have to feel guilty about it, I can do it, I can go away for two weeks

02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:42.440
[Guest]: and really try and understand craft differently. Because as academics, we are not really taught

02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:48.680
[Guest]: craft, right? We have expertise in a subject, but not the craft of writing per se, which

02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:53.360
[Guest]: is much more intuitive and something I can do intuitively. But I would like to know more

02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:59.160
[Guest]: about the craft. So it was my first experience. It was a wonderful workshop, where I was with

02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:05.080
[Guest]: other MFA sort of writers, it was in the American tradition of giving very constructive, compassionate

02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:11.240
[Guest]: feedback to each other's chapter. But it was a luxury. And I don't think I can keep doing

02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:15.440
[Guest]: it. I've done it once, I don't know when I would be able to do it again. But the thing

02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:22.240
[Guest]: is that it was very important, because I learned from fiction writers, how to craft a scene,

02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:27.600
[Guest]: for example, how to, I understood from reading their work, how they were approaching their

02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:31.680
[Guest]: work, how dialogue is just written. I mean, you know, on separate lines, such a simple

02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:37.920
[Guest]: thing. But it's something that, as a reader, you don't really notice it sometimes, you

02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:45.880
[Guest]: know, or how you build a character, or, you know, what each sentence, the rhythm of each

02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:55.840
[Guest]: sentence, how each sentence sounds, those kind of things I really realized were important.

02:07:55.840 --> 02:08:02.840
[Guest]: And so when I went back with this fresh eye, I was able to really apply it in a new way

02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:10.360
[Guest]: to my work. But here also, I feel like, you know, I gave myself permission to go out and

02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:16.560
[Guest]: do this. And it was a big leap for me. I came back thinking that, oh, how wonderful it would

02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:21.640
[Guest]: be to have this kind of an opportunity or, you know, to create what I had called the

02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:29.640
[Guest]: XOXO hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses, kind of a workshop for women to write in. And,

02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:33.760
[Guest]: and I shopped it around, I sent it around to a few publishers, but it didn't pick up

02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:43.040
[Guest]: at that time. But, I mean, I would love, I think it's a great opportunity to, if publishers

02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:48.880
[Guest]: could actually create these kinds of spaces for women to come together and read and write.

02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:53.680
[Guest]: I did try one more time when I, when I was writing Intimate City to go away and write

02:08:53.680 --> 02:09:00.320
[Guest]: somewhere. Okay, so, but that was a hilarious, I mean, it was a big flop, I would say. I

02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:05.160
[Guest]: went to Karjat. I thought, let me take a few days and I will go away from everyone and

02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:12.920
[Guest]: I will go and write. Okay. I went. There was nobody there. I was the only person staying

02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:19.240
[Guest]: in that place. There was one woman who would teach me how to do clay work, pottery work,

02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:25.840
[Guest]: etc. And the rest of the time I would have on my own. It was really spooky. And I just

02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:31.520
[Guest]: could not get even one word down, you know. And then it just got worse and worse. And

02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:35.760
[Guest]: then I wonder, I think the second day or third day, I woke up in the morning and I looked

02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:40.760
[Guest]: outside my window and I hadn't put my glasses on yet in the morning, but I could tell that

02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:47.000
[Guest]: there was a dog outside my door. And I could tell just by looking at it that it was not

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:59.600
[Guest]: alive. You know, it was like a, like a sack of fur just laying there. And I was so spooked.

02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:03.680
[Guest]: And I had never seen something like that before. And I realized that, my God, there is some,

02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:09.800
[Guest]: even without my glasses, I could make out that there is no life force in that, you know.

02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:17.200
[Guest]: And I was very, very shaken by that experience. And I thought, okay, this is not happening.

02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:25.520
[Guest]: So I cut it short and I went back home. But it was, what that did do is that I read massively

02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:33.080
[Guest]: in those few days. I couldn't put a word down. But I finished a book and I made a clay crocodile,

02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:40.640
[Guest]: which I called Sultan and I brought that home. And I mean, it was one of those really strange

02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:47.080
[Guest]: experiences which showed me what life, what life force looks like. And I don't know why

02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:56.040
[Guest]: that dog came and, you know, came outside my door and passed away. It was, I can't say

02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:05.360
[Guest]: it gave me some major aha thing, but it really made me experience something called life force.

02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:14.600
[Guest]: And that I came back with a sense of appreciating, you know, the something supernatural. And

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:23.680
[Guest]: I'm, I'm not a believer per se, but I felt that I witnessed something or had a moment

02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:29.680
[Guest]: there that, you know, I'm reading a book, a book called Thin Places, which is about,

02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:33.600
[Guest]: you know, like those moments in life when there's a very thin membrane between one world

02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:39.160
[Guest]: and another, you know, in that sense. And for me, that was like a thin place, you know,

02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:45.880
[Guest]: where I felt like some osmosis was happening at that moment. It sounds odd to say, but

02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:50.480
[Guest]: I mean, if I'm, you know, that was the other time that I tried to find an alone, alone

02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:56.520
[Guest]: time to write. And I went back and I realized that, no, I mean, a room of your own is good

02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:02.080
[Guest]: enough. You don't need to go away. A room of your own is a dream for many of us, especially

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:13.160
[Guest]: in Bombay. Yeah, but writing in the, you know, busyness of everyday life, I think it seeps

02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:22.760
[Guest]: into your work and it has its power and impact also. But yes, I would like there to be spaces

02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:28.520
[Guest]: where I get to think. I mean, it's such a luxury. I would love to be a thinking, you

02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:34.720
[Amit Varma]: know, like a writer that just writes someday. You know, I just think that these five minutes

02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:39.120
[Amit Varma]: where you spoke about that time in Garjat are going to be among my favorite five minutes

02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:44.560
[Amit Varma]: of the show ever. And you should really, I mean, it would make for such a lovely novella,

02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:49.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, just the feeling of things without spelling anything out too much, just this

02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:55.080
[Amit Varma]: notion of this membrane between. And what's Sultan up to these days?

02:12:55.080 --> 02:13:01.280
[Guest]: Sultan has unfortunately lost a limb in onerous dusting that has been done by, but

02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:06.360
[Amit Varma]: I shouldn't have asked that question. Part of the charm is kind of gone. But this was

02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:14.520
[Amit Varma]: this is just such a lovely story in this kind of so much there. You spoke about, you know,

02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:20.800
[Amit Varma]: having to consciously train yourself to come out of an academic way of thinking and about

02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:25.080
[Amit Varma]: taking influences from fiction of how to build narrative, how to get into character, how

02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:28.960
[Amit Varma]: to write dialogue and all of that. Tell me a little bit about this. Tell me a little

02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:35.440
[Amit Varma]: bit of, you know, that journey in finding the voice of the book. Like I'm imagining

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:39.560
[Amit Varma]: that the voice of the book would be very, very different from the voice of the PhD thesis,

02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:47.280
[Amit Varma]: right? So what was that sort of journey like? And do you, did you feel during that journey

02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:55.240
[Amit Varma]: that you are also thinking in different slash better ways about the subject itself? Like

02:13:55.240 --> 02:14:00.160
[Amit Varma]: there is such a close connection between writing and thinking in that sense, that just the

02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:03.880
[Amit Varma]: act of writing, even if you're not, even if you're just daily journaling and you're not

02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:07.560
[Amit Varma]: writing about anything in particular, I mean, this is something Amitav Kumar spoke about

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:12.520
[Amit Varma]: in his episode with me at length, that if you just write every day, you are adding something

02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:18.720
[Amit Varma]: to yourself with that little bit of reflection that happens, and you become a different person.

02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:23.360
[Amit Varma]: And in your case, you're writing about the subject you mentioned before that you would

02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:28.000
[Amit Varma]: once have looked at beauty pageants and the people who participated in them in a particular

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.520
[Amit Varma]: way. And by the end of the book, you looked at them in a completely different way. And

02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:35.640
[Amit Varma]: these are perhaps two different journeys. One is a journey of your writing voice and

02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:40.520
[Amit Varma]: how that evolved and how that changed you, perhaps. And the other is sort of a journey

02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:45.120
[Amit Varma]: of how you think about the content itself. So tell me a little bit about these two and

02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:49.800
[Amit Varma]: are they related in any way? Might not be the case, but tell me a little bit about these

02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:50.800
[Guest]: two.

02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:55.160
[Guest]: Cheryl Streed, who is, you know, she was one of the mentors on the workshop. And I remember

02:14:55.160 --> 02:15:03.720
[Guest]: she said that the voice of a book, I mean, your voice on paper is the most relaxed expression

02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:12.120
[Guest]: of yourself. And I love that term. And the thing in academia is that you're expected

02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:19.120
[Guest]: to keep yourself away from your academic work, right? Because it's supposed to bias your

02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:23.880
[Guest]: work in some way, right? It'll expose your biases and you're supposed to be objective.

02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:33.220
[Guest]: So you try and keep yourself completely away from the text. But I mean, I think what was

02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:39.620
[Guest]: different in Mannequin was that I put myself in the book, you know, and that's a radical

02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:45.840
[Guest]: departure from academia in general, right? When I put myself in the book, the story changed.

02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:49.800
[Guest]: That's when the story became about fashion and feminism, because it became about the

02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:59.600
[Guest]: conflict between me and, you know, the women that who were supposedly on the opposite sort

02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:09.280
[Guest]: of side. So this voice, I think, really comes with allowing yourself into your work. And

02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:15.400
[Guest]: I feel that is, that's a strength that I feel I'm building, whether it was through Mannequin

02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:24.600
[Guest]: and through Intimacy as well. The act of writing, for me, is very important to building theory.

02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:31.280
[Guest]: It is through the act of writing and rewriting that I arrive at theory. As a sociologist,

02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:37.920
[Guest]: actually it's important for me to arrive at theory. Actually, that is the difference between

02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:45.320
[Guest]: a sociologist and an anthropologist who is very into detail and thick description, elements

02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:51.400
[Guest]: of which, of course, are there. But the sociologist is expected to have grand theory. Now, I don't,

02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:58.560
[Guest]: I'm not saying it's necessarily grand theory, but it is a trained, we are trained to search

02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:09.000
[Guest]: for that theory at the end of the day. So, for example, for Mannequin, you know, I realized

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:14.160
[Guest]: as I was writing and rewriting all the stories of the women models that actually what I had

02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:24.480
[Guest]: witnessed or what I was seeing was a new set of women were entering the workforce in this

02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:32.560
[Guest]: period, you know, just like they had, say, post partition Bengal, when a lot of women

02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:37.640
[Guest]: entered the workforce. I don't know if you've seen Mahanagar by Satyajit Ray. And so that,

02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:43.280
[Guest]: you know, sort of shows it was a period when middle class women entered the workforce.

02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:48.400
[Guest]: And so that is it, there was a similar moment, actually, that was happening in that 90s and

02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:54.440
[Guest]: 2000s, when young women were joining the modeling industry, which is, they were the first generation

02:17:54.440 --> 02:18:00.120
[Guest]: of their time to start working in the workflow, to migrate to another city, to live independently

02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:07.360
[Guest]: on their own to find financial independence. So that's the, you know, that was for me,

02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:13.840
[Guest]: that was the big pattern that I felt was being revealed to me. And it was only through the

02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:23.000
[Guest]: act of writing that I find that I get closer and closer and closer to really the bones

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:32.040
[Guest]: of what I'm really saying or thinking. So it's not the same process for every academic

02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:40.280
[Guest]: or sociologist or whatever. But for me, that's how I do arrive at, I arrive at myself. And

02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:45.520
[Guest]: I arrive at theory through the act of writing.

02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:48.840
[Amit Varma]: One of the great TIL moments I had in the show was when I was recording an episode with

02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:55.120
[Amit Varma]: Chinmay Tumbe on his great book, India Moving, where he pointed out that the largest source

02:18:55.120 --> 02:19:00.040
[Amit Varma]: of internal migration in India is women getting married, because women get married and they

02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:04.620
[Amit Varma]: move to move with their husband wherever the husband is. And that's the largest source

02:19:04.620 --> 02:19:09.160
[Amit Varma]: of internal migration in the country where you would imagine in your mind's eye, if you

02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:13.920
[Amit Varma]: think of internal migration, it's like migrants from UP, Bihar, moving to Delhi or Bombay

02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:21.640
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth. And what you're talking about here is also seems like a seismic shift

02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:25.600
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that it is women migrating, but it is not for marriage, it is not following

02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:33.080
[Amit Varma]: a husband. It is for job prospects. It's an incredibly empowering act. Like I did an episode

02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:38.720
[Amit Varma]: with Shrena Bhattacharya on just these subjects. And she was speaking about how one of the

02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:44.400
[Amit Varma]: possible reasons she gave a number of reasons for the decline of women in the workforce

02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:48.920
[Amit Varma]: is that many of the booming industries are, you know, things like construction and all

02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:53.420
[Amit Varma]: of that, where typically you have male laborers, right? Women won't migrate to work at a construction

02:19:53.420 --> 02:19:58.920
[Amit Varma]: site alone unless they're going with a husband. And it seems that industries like these new

02:19:58.920 --> 02:20:04.160
[Amit Varma]: industries like the modeling industry are an industry where, you know, women will come

02:20:04.160 --> 02:20:10.120
[Amit Varma]: from one city to another on their own to look for opportunities there. And therefore, it

02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:16.800
[Amit Varma]: is in almost a very opposite of what the earlier feminist criticism would have been with the

02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:20.960
[Amit Varma]: earlier criticism would have been that women are being objectified and blah, blah, blah.

02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:27.000
[Amit Varma]: But actually, women are really being empowered in a sense by these new sort of opportunities

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:33.760
[Amit Varma]: that they have got. So was this sort of the kind of journey that you made as well? And

02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:38.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, what was this sort of process like? What was it like talking to these young women

02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:42.240
[Amit Varma]: and kind of were there light bulb moments in there as well for you?

02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:47.800
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely. For the first point, you know, this idea that marriage is the most

02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:56.120
[Guest]: prominent migration stream. Actually, this line of thinking invisibilizes a lot of the

02:20:56.120 --> 02:21:02.960
[Guest]: migration that has also happened for work, especially cross-border migration, right?

02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:09.280
[Guest]: I mean, you have domestic workers, you know, from all over the world, you know, sort of

02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:13.960
[Guest]: crisscrossing going here, there, everywhere. There have been women migrating for work for

02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:20.720
[Guest]: decades. Even when women migrate with marriage, they migrate for work because they migrate

02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:26.720
[Guest]: and then they go work. They are also migrant labor in on construction sites or wherever

02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:32.520
[Guest]: they go, right? A lot of the time it is Jodi labor that's happening. So it is a couple

02:21:32.520 --> 02:21:38.480
[Guest]: is contracted, but for wages of one person and a couple gets contracted. And this is

02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:48.640
[Guest]: a common way of actually contracting labor. So, I mean, the absolutely migration for work

02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:54.200
[Guest]: that women have been doing has been present. It has been invisibilized and it has not only

02:21:54.200 --> 02:22:03.000
[Guest]: been for marriage. I, in my work, I found, so, you know, I'm talking about specifically

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:08.520
[Guest]: women in the modeling industry, but I found that there are things that I learned that

02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:15.200
[Guest]: gave me that illuminated realities about women's working lives in general, right? So, for example,

02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:20.400
[Guest]: one of the things and there are three things that I, and I've said it before, three things

02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:26.480
[Guest]: that I realized were common to women's working lives, which is, and I'll say the three of

02:22:26.480 --> 02:22:34.200
[Guest]: them and then I'll explain them. The invisibility of their labor, the condition, the conditionality

02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:40.320
[Guest]: of their work and the cost. What I mean is that like women models, they assume to be

02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:45.240
[Guest]: not really doing work. It's just wearing clothes and sashaying down and I'm like, well, where's

02:22:45.240 --> 02:22:51.360
[Guest]: the labor in that, right? So let's check, but there is work as I've shown in my book.

02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:57.200
[Guest]: It is, modeling is a form of labor. It is a form of informal work. It is gendered labor,

02:22:57.200 --> 02:23:04.320
[Guest]: but it is assumed to be not really work or just women's work. Similarly, what women do

02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:10.360
[Guest]: is always considered, is always invisibilized. Whether it is work in the home, when it's

02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:15.600
[Guest]: paid work, it's more complicated, right? Because it's visible, but women try to stay invisible

02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:21.400
[Guest]: because you don't want to, the premise of middle class respectability is seclusion of

02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:28.040
[Guest]: women. So women who do need to go out and work, they're the ones who go out and work.

02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:32.600
[Guest]: That's the understanding that we have in society, right? Not because it is empowering or it's

02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:38.200
[Guest]: transformative or you want to do it or it's fulfilling, etc. Even when you are in paid

02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:43.960
[Guest]: work, many women try to minimize that, even if they earn more than men, more than their

02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:49.760
[Guest]: parents, they try. And because there is a sense that it's going to create an imbalance,

02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:55.200
[Guest]: it will threaten their relationships. We don't have an imagination of a good relationship

02:23:55.200 --> 02:24:05.120
[Guest]: where women are earning more than men or they are visibly in the public eye. I mean, even

02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:12.440
[Guest]: we have films like Abhiman and there are ample cultural references where this is a source

02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:20.720
[Guest]: of tension. So it's best to, it is either invisibilized or you try and manage the visibility.

02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:24.920
[Guest]: You don't want to be too visible. The second thing, the conditionality. So models would

02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:30.280
[Guest]: be told, okay, you can work by their parents, they would, okay, but you can't wear a bikini.

02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:34.300
[Guest]: You can't do this kind of work. You can work until you get married. You can do modeling

02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:41.800
[Guest]: until you get married off, etc. Similarly, women generally in paid work, they have conditions.

02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:48.080
[Guest]: Finish housework and then go to work. Come home, make sure all care work is done. Right?

02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:53.800
[Guest]: So you can work if you don't travel too much. You can't go on tours. You can't come home

02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:59.320
[Guest]: too late. Everything is under this, within this framework of conditions. The third is

02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:06.520
[Guest]: the cost. In the case of models, it's stigma. In the case of others, it can be, I mean,

02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:11.880
[Guest]: you know, the relationships as we were talking about, stigma is always there. You leave the

02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:18.560
[Guest]: house, the possibility of stigma is always there. So there is definitely a cost to being

02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:26.000
[Guest]: part of the paid labor workforce. And I feel that these three define the experiences of

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:34.320
[Guest]: women in paid work, you know, and perhaps that's the reason also for such low female

02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:41.840
[Guest]: workforce participation. You know, it is the other, I mean, I realized, for example, that

02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:48.360
[Guest]: when I would, when I did a comparison between a woman who came from, say, an upper class

02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:55.400
[Guest]: house and a young girl who came from a more lower middle class family, and both of them

02:25:55.400 --> 02:26:02.840
[Guest]: were working with the same modeling agency. The woman who came from the upper class household,

02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:08.560
[Guest]: she faced like a lowering of her status when she joined the modeling industry and she won.

02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:14.720
[Guest]: She said, you know, do I have to just for 10,000 bucks, I have to do all this. So it's

02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:24.080
[Guest]: like, you know, there is, it's not a fulfilling experience because of these reasons. On the

02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:30.120
[Guest]: other hand, it is also a transformative experience, you know, for those who are in paid work and

02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:36.440
[Guest]: so on. So it's not difficult to understand why there is reduced female workforce participation,

02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:42.600
[Guest]: in a sense, even because I mean, there's no effort to actually create the conditions for

02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:53.520
[Guest]: which women can imagine their lives as free to be ambitious, you know, or really dream

02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:59.840
[Guest]: and want to be anything they want to be. There's so many hurdles in front of them.

02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:04.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, earlier when you were talking about your own process of finding the space and

02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:09.480
[Amit Varma]: the time to write, the phrase you use two or three times is I gave myself permission.

02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:14.280
[Amit Varma]: And is it then the case that, you know, the way you said it, it's as if it is unusual,

02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:18.380
[Amit Varma]: it is a big step, it is a big leap, I gave myself permission. Is it then a ubiquitous

02:27:18.380 --> 02:27:22.680
[Amit Varma]: problem that women don't give themselves permission enough?

02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:30.840
[Guest]: Yes, I think so. I think even the best of us operate with very deeply ingrained ideas

02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:38.760
[Guest]: of duty and, you know, a sense of responsibility towards our roles. And I think parenting is

02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:44.700
[Guest]: one of those parenting, caregiving, those kinds of ones are very deeply ingrained. So

02:27:44.700 --> 02:27:53.240
[Guest]: it is about giving yourself permission. It's also, I mean, it's not just in this scenario,

02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:58.560
[Guest]: but even giving yourself permission to tell the truth, right? Giving yourself permission

02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:05.920
[Guest]: to write personal things, to write about the violence you've experienced, to talk about

02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:13.160
[Guest]: problems in your relationships, to write about parents, to write about your children, which

02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:20.120
[Guest]: must be even more complicated. So, as writers also, we have to give ourselves, that's why

02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:25.080
[Guest]: memoirs are so interesting, because how do you arrive at a place where you're actually

02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:33.120
[Guest]: able to open the doors and really let yourself bleed on the page in that sense, you know,

02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:40.060
[Guest]: which is why I admire Natasha Badwar so much, you know, because she's able to actually,

02:28:40.060 --> 02:28:45.120
[Guest]: you know, open paths of herself to people, which is why I feel that people also respond

02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:51.280
[Guest]: to her in a certain way. So that's, so there are different levels of permission and we

02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:59.320
[Guest]: arrive again, we get there differently at our own pace, you know, and it's like being

02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:03.600
[Guest]: able to, like I was saying, talking about violence that we've experienced. And I feel

02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:11.320
[Guest]: like many women have arrived at that place of talking about violence or the Me Too, for

02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:18.200
[Guest]: example, that took so long to happen, really. But even for men, their experiences of violence,

02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:22.560
[Guest]: their experience of bullying, something, they have not, we have not arrived there, I feel.

02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:29.760
[Guest]: And that's where I feel, for example, in this case of this young man in the cricket, you

02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:34.960
[Guest]: know, there was recently that case of bullying and being hung from the 15th floor by one

02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:44.580
[Guest]: of the IPL league teams many years back. But that kind of revelation, I think, should open

02:29:44.580 --> 02:29:51.640
[Guest]: up a conversation on experiences of bullying and the kind of violence that we have not

02:29:51.640 --> 02:29:54.680
[Guest]: heard about. And we should.

02:29:54.680 --> 02:29:58.880
[Amit Varma]: And you know, as a cricket journalist, I can tell you that that kind of bullying was actually

02:29:58.880 --> 02:30:04.440
[Amit Varma]: much more common back in the day, within the team. I think Irfan Pathan, for example, got

02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:07.720
[Amit Varma]: bullied very badly like that. I won't take the names of the people who did it. There's

02:30:07.720 --> 02:30:13.880
[Amit Varma]: no point to it now. But what happened to Yuzvindra Chahal, for example, is, you know, even before

02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:17.520
[Amit Varma]: this, there was an incident where during a party, these people just for fun, they tied

02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:20.880
[Amit Varma]: him up with a rope and they put a thing on his mouth and then they forgot. And he was

02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:25.800
[Amit Varma]: like that all night and discovered by the cleaner the next day. And my, you know, default

02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:30.320
[Amit Varma]: thought here would be that those people should, their career should be over. Whoever did this

02:30:30.320 --> 02:30:34.640
[Amit Varma]: just on the spot over, right? There's not even something you want to discuss, you want

02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:39.360
[Amit Varma]: to, but it doesn't happen. No, I mean, and going back to that thing of giving yourself

02:30:39.360 --> 02:30:43.520
[Amit Varma]: permission, you know, I think that can be a light bulb moment for someone listening

02:30:43.520 --> 02:30:47.680
[Amit Varma]: to this to realize that you can give yourself permission, not just in the sense of the word

02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:52.080
[Amit Varma]: permission, that you're holding back from things because you don't have permission,

02:30:52.080 --> 02:30:57.160
[Amit Varma]: but also from the point of view of agency, that you can give yourself permission, you

02:30:57.160 --> 02:31:01.600
[Amit Varma]: know. And I think perhaps some of us who are more fortunate take it for granted that we

02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:06.980
[Amit Varma]: are able to give ourselves permission, but that it's a conceptual leap that anyone can

02:31:06.980 --> 02:31:14.600
[Amit Varma]: make at some level. We hold ourselves back too much. Let's now sort of come to Intimacy,

02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:21.760
[Amit Varma]: that you've done Mannequin and you've, I think, looked at the people within that book, not

02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:27.840
[Amit Varma]: just as, you know, subjects to whom you are applying a particular large sociological theory,

02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:32.120
[Amit Varma]: but as actual real people you've spoken to, you've captured their voices, you've told

02:31:32.120 --> 02:31:36.440
[Amit Varma]: their stories, and you've arrived at this very different understanding of them as people

02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:41.140
[Amit Varma]: with free will and agency, and they're doing what they're doing, and a much better understanding

02:31:41.140 --> 02:31:48.280
[Amit Varma]: of that. How did then that next step to Intimacy sort of come about? Like you mentioned that

02:31:48.280 --> 02:31:54.040
[Amit Varma]: when you were coming up with a plan for a PhD thesis, you know, the scope of your original

02:31:54.040 --> 02:32:00.400
[Amit Varma]: proposal included what is an Intimacy that you also look at. So what was it always on

02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:04.320
[Amit Varma]: the cards that after Mannequin, this is like a natural progression or is it something that?

02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:12.960
[Guest]: No, not at all. Actually, this was a completely different moment. And it was connected. So,

02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:18.920
[Guest]: you know, I'm not in academia per se. So, I have, you know, I have a regular job, etc,

02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:25.800
[Guest]: etc. I work in the development sector. So there is, I think I was at a time and place

02:32:25.800 --> 02:32:31.360
[Guest]: where an opportunity arose to apply for this postdoctoral fellowship at the Tata Institute

02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:38.120
[Guest]: of Social Sciences for something called the Urban Aspirations Project. And I think I had

02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:45.200
[Guest]: just been, it had just been in my mind, this question of middle class women, and sex work,

02:32:45.200 --> 02:32:50.920
[Guest]: you know, where were the voices of middle class women or middle class men as clients?

02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:57.360
[Guest]: And what was the internet doing? You know, I had just finished a study called Erotics,

02:32:57.360 --> 02:33:02.880
[Guest]: which was a multi country study. And we, myself and Maya Indira Ganesh, my colleague and friend,

02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:08.200
[Guest]: we had done the bit on India. And we looked at how young women in Mumbai were using the

02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:14.080
[Guest]: internet to explore their sexual rights to express themselves and to find information

02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:19.200
[Guest]: on sexual health, and to really, you know, have relationships and so on. And this was

02:33:19.200 --> 02:33:26.280
[Guest]: in 2000 and around then 9, 10, you know, that was the time period. So, I was interested

02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:31.280
[Guest]: in the internet and sexuality rights. I had already been working on sex work, sex workers

02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:36.320
[Guest]: rights movements, I consider myself an ally to the sex workers rights movements. So, I

02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:43.360
[Guest]: had been working on this field. But I hadn't, but I had this question, like what, what about

02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:50.000
[Guest]: middle class women? We talk a lot about choices and consent and the majburi of poor women

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:53.880
[Guest]: who are in sex work. But what about middle class women? What about escorts? What's happening

02:33:53.880 --> 02:33:59.040
[Guest]: with the internet? So, with those questions in mind, I applied for the postdoc fellowship,

02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:05.640
[Guest]: and I got it. And it was again, a year at TIS. It was in, it got me a room of my own

02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:14.080
[Guest]: very far away, I had to travel, this is very far from where I stay. So, it was a stretch.

02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:21.480
[Guest]: And it gave me access to journals of all kinds. And it gave me an ID, an email ID, through

02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:28.520
[Guest]: which a TIS.edu email ID through which I could actually work from an institution. Institutions

02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:33.280
[Guest]: are really important when you're doing work, sex, sex work research, because it gives you

02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:40.480
[Guest]: a credibility, it gives you a sort of a safety net, actually, you know, you feel safer somehow

02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:44.560
[Guest]: when you're working within an institutional framework, especially on something like sex

02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:52.160
[Guest]: work. So, it was just an opportunity to answer a question that had been buzzing in my head.

02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:57.960
[Guest]: And so I took the year to do that, to do the research to devise this research to carry

02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:05.160
[Guest]: it out. And then, you know, as I sort of, when I finished Mannequin, I think I went

02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:10.600
[Guest]: back to it. And I thought that, okay, no, this also needs to be out there, it needs

02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:16.760
[Guest]: to be in some shape and form. And so then I, my publisher was already very keen on it.

02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:23.160
[Guest]: Even before Mannequin, they were keen on this book. So, and so then I think I finished it

02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:30.000
[Amit Varma]: during the pandemic. And had you already arrived at the way one

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:33.800
[Amit Varma]: thinks about this, like one of the things you've described in the book at great length

02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:40.240
[Amit Varma]: and very eloquently is on the different feminist perspectives on sex work and the battles that

02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:46.480
[Amit Varma]: have raged around it, like one perspective, obviously, is that it's basically coercion,

02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:51.880
[Amit Varma]: it's a patriarchy, it's, you know, and therefore sex work just by default is wrong. And the

02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:56.360
[Amit Varma]: other point of view is that no, it's like any other work, it's like selling shoes, like

02:35:56.360 --> 02:36:02.200
[Amit Varma]: from that, you know, that earlier quote, and therefore, any work that is done with agency,

02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:07.320
[Amit Varma]: you have to dignify it, you can't, you know, criminalize it, or you can't cast moral judgment

02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:10.680
[Amit Varma]: on it. And these are sort of the different points of views. And there are all kinds of

02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:16.080
[Amit Varma]: nuances in between, and so on and so forth. So what was your journey in terms of thinking

02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:21.640
[Amit Varma]: about this? And how much of that was shaped by the actual interactions you had with, you

02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:25.400
[Amit Varma]: know, other activists or sex workers themselves?

02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:32.440
[Guest]: It's completely shaped by my interactions with both sex workers as well as other activists.

02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:39.160
[Guest]: And it's emerged over time. So there are different positions, the positions have shifted. And,

02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:42.880
[Guest]: and as I said, you know, there's nothing more important than actually hearing sex workers

02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:51.680
[Guest]: themselves talk about the context of their lives. And in intimate city, you know, there

02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:58.320
[Guest]: are some portions, which I would say are more recent. So, for example, there are some voices

02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:05.520
[Guest]: of, you know, sex workers who have heard on podcasts, for example. And so they're much

02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:12.920
[Guest]: more recent. And you're in or there are, you know, some voices who are on Twitter. So,

02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:20.400
[Guest]: you know, one hears of their experiences firsthand from those sources. These are not Indian sex

02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:28.080
[Guest]: workers, who are not on Twitter and on doing podcasts, etc. I wish there were, but there

02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:36.120
[Guest]: aren't at the moment. And so they are informed by current voices that one hears as well as

02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:39.360
[Guest]: those accumulated over the years.

02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:45.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and you also, I'll read out another passage from your book, where at one point

02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:49.520
[Amit Varma]: you write, quote, this is a new landscape for feminists. Here the question of sexual

02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:54.040
[Amit Varma]: commerce has moved beyond the old debate of whether it is work or violence. It is a livelihood

02:37:54.040 --> 02:37:58.620
[Amit Varma]: and form of work and enterprise and business linked to global flows and local realities.

02:37:58.620 --> 02:38:02.360
[Amit Varma]: It is a real and discursive space that is contested in which labor rights and human

02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:07.040
[Amit Varma]: rights are sought. Solidarity is built even as violence and oppression is experienced.

02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:12.920
[Amit Varma]: There is simultaneously a powerful rescue industry out there that dismisses these discursive

02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:17.640
[Amit Varma]: advances, obsessed with containing the movement of adult women, believing it to be a form

02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:22.560
[Amit Varma]: of protection for women's own good. Sex work has divided feminists like no other issue

02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:27.720
[Amit Varma]: in India as much as elsewhere. And there have been many pages devoted to exploring the relationship

02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:32.680
[Amit Varma]: between feminists and sex workers. This is because sex work gets at the heart of several

02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:39.240
[Amit Varma]: important feminist areas of debate, agency, choice, consent, and bodily autonomy, stop

02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:45.800
[Amit Varma]: quote. And are these debates some things that then rage even within the circles that you're

02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:51.080
[Amit Varma]: part of, even within your fellow activists, where you discuss these things, like within

02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:56.560
[Amit Varma]: these in-groups also, would there be different attitudes to the sex workers themselves? And

02:38:56.560 --> 02:38:59.800
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to come to the law later because the attitude of the law is a whole different

02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:06.000
[Amit Varma]: subject here. But, you know, within the movement itself, are these things that have to be sort

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:12.140
[Amit Varma]: of negotiated? And in your own case, what was your evolution like, you know, actually

02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:17.260
[Amit Varma]: encountering sex workers, talking to them? In what ways did that increase your understanding

02:39:17.260 --> 02:39:29.120
[Guest]: of what's going on there? Definitely, there is debate. I think it's hard to have one position

02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:36.200
[Guest]: on any issue. But these issues in particular, sex work is a particularly divisive issue,

02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:41.720
[Guest]: right? And in the initial years, I don't hear this as much anymore. But in the initial years,

02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:47.280
[Guest]: people would ask even to each other that, are you saying you would allow your daughter

02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:51.760
[Guest]: to do sex work, for example, you know, what would you, is that what you're saying, you

02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:58.400
[Guest]: know, when you say that women can consent or do have a choice and to do sex work? And

02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:02.560
[Guest]: actually, there's no answer to that, right? Like, how can you, that's, it's a conversation

02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:09.520
[Guest]: stopper. I feel that because really would, I mean, it's such a foolish question to ask.

02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:16.160
[Guest]: It's not like there are special courses in doing sex work at university, etc. Choices

02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:24.520
[Guest]: are not made in a vacuum, right? As they are determined by caste, class, etc. So we would,

02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:30.560
[Guest]: for example, not be, I mean, where is the choice to be a domestic worker or to do or

02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:34.480
[Guest]: to, you know, there is a certain framework within which you make that choice, right?

02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:41.960
[Guest]: You wouldn't be a car mechanic or a car salesman. I mean, it's not a, they're the result, they're

02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:50.160
[Guest]: the outcomes of a certain caste, class, socio-economic background. And so these kind of questions

02:40:50.160 --> 02:41:00.440
[Guest]: I feel are, they just prevent an understanding from evolving of why people do certain things

02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:10.680
[Guest]: in life. And I've, I find that more and more there, you know, there is one of the questions,

02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:16.480
[Guest]: for example, when Intimacy was being released, one of the questions that came to me and this

02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:21.600
[Guest]: question has come up in other places as well. People asking me that, what would you recommend

02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:28.580
[Guest]: to someone who wants to do sex work or who wants to be an escort? And I take this question

02:41:28.580 --> 02:41:35.560
[Guest]: very seriously, because, and I answer with great seriousness, because I really feel that

02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:40.880
[Guest]: if you want to do escort work, it's an, you know, if you feel that that is something that

02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:51.360
[Guest]: you want to engage in, you must find a community, even if it is an online community, because

02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:55.880
[Guest]: that's the way to be safe. To be a solitary worker is very vulnerable, puts you in a very

02:41:55.880 --> 02:42:01.680
[Guest]: vulnerable spot. So I see it as a serious question of someone who is considering it.

02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:08.640
[Guest]: And I find that there must be many, many young people who would have done some sort of sexual

02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:14.440
[Guest]: service provision in the pandemic to make ends meet, etc. I feel it is the outcome of

02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:19.880
[Guest]: precarity and it's not a career option or a vocation or something like that. But it

02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:28.080
[Guest]: is a form of a transaction that just because we don't like it, perhaps, or it doesn't fit

02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:34.900
[Guest]: into a certain moral framework we have grown up with, that we can remove the possibility

02:42:34.900 --> 02:42:38.500
[Guest]: of it actually happening, whether it is to our children, whether it is to our family

02:42:38.500 --> 02:42:49.320
[Guest]: members or to us. We cannot really never say never, you know, in that sense. So I mean,

02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:57.200
[Guest]: some of these conversations are very rhetorical. They're not rooted in reality. I find this

02:42:57.200 --> 02:43:03.880
[Guest]: also this idea of the shifts that you were talking about, that's important. So this idea

02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:11.520
[Guest]: that sex work is work, right, that was very powerful in the 90s. And it is work, it is

02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:18.120
[Guest]: labour, it does increase people's self-confidence. But so what, right? It's remained at the discursive

02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:23.920
[Guest]: level. It hasn't resulted in better working conditions, etc, etc. That is achieved only

02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:29.320
[Guest]: if the, I mean, it's related to the sector that actually if the sector improves the informal

02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:36.360
[Guest]: sector within which sex work is located, if that is supported in some way, then perhaps

02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:43.780
[Guest]: rights of sex workers are going to be similar to rights of other workers. Sex workers being

02:43:43.780 --> 02:43:49.920
[Guest]: organised has been their most important strength. And actually that is what feminists have appreciated.

02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:55.960
[Guest]: And that's something I write about. I ask that, is that why feminists are allies of

02:43:55.960 --> 02:44:01.640
[Guest]: sex workers groups? You know, where is the solitary sex worker? Would we be supporting

02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:08.960
[Guest]: solitary sex workers? It is really their mobilisation and their strength as a movement with a very

02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:15.680
[Guest]: strong feminist politics that have created this alliance. And they support one another's

02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:23.640
[Guest]: agendas for the most part. But there's the other shift, I think. Now, okay, sex workers

02:44:23.640 --> 02:44:29.760
[Guest]: work now, we are also hearing about sex work as service provision, which is the term that

02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:36.800
[Guest]: most of my, the interview is used, you know, we are service providers. Okay, now, we understand

02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:41.920
[Guest]: that now, now the economy is a service economy. So this understanding of service provision

02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:50.640
[Guest]: is sort of fits in very nicely with that. And it also, this is the new part that I realised

02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:57.360
[Guest]: while thinking about it, that actually escorts perhaps are not the same as sex work as I

02:44:57.360 --> 02:45:03.800
[Guest]: had understood it all along. Sex work, the escort, you know, these, the people I interviewed

02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:08.240
[Guest]: kept saying that we're not standing under a lamppost. This is not sex work. You think

02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:13.080
[Guest]: this is sex work? I don't think so. This is service provision. And I kept thinking, I

02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:17.440
[Guest]: thought that, okay, no, they're actually just trying to distance themselves from the stigma.

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:21.560
[Guest]: But then I realised that no, actually, there is something a little different in what they're

02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:26.560
[Guest]: doing. In fact, the difference is that they are part of the gig economy, you know. So

02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:32.760
[Guest]: escort service provision, that kind of transactional sex, we can say is part of the gig economy,

02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:38.120
[Guest]: which is different from the informal economy in which traditional sex work is located.

02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:43.600
[Guest]: Again the question, so what, right? So what if escort service is part of the gig economy?

02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:49.360
[Guest]: And that's a question that I struggle with. Yes, it can also lead to a different self-perception.

02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:55.180
[Guest]: You can call yourself a gig economy worker, you can align yourself with several demands.

02:45:55.180 --> 02:46:00.120
[Guest]: But can you organise? Will you be able to organise, which is so central to collective

02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:08.440
[Guest]: bargaining? Is it going to draw attention to the precarious lives that people in the

02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:13.440
[Guest]: gig economy are leading? You know, the precarious wider economic context within which the gig

02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:21.840
[Guest]: economy has emerged? So these kind of questions do arise for me. And these are the kind of

02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:28.520
[Guest]: shifts that are happening while I'm writing and while I'm listening to the voices that

02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:34.120
[Guest]: my interviewees are bringing. The third thing that I really wanted to talk about is this

02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:43.440
[Guest]: thing you said about, you know, trafficking and prostitution, right? What is the shift

02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:51.280
[Guest]: that really is important for me? And for me, it is really, I mean, initially one saw that

02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:56.760
[Guest]: trafficking is equal to prostitution, even in our laws, they are equated and made the

02:46:56.760 --> 02:47:01.920
[Guest]: same, which means that there is a belief that every single woman in sex work has been trafficked

02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:09.360
[Guest]: and she needs to be rescued, rehabilitated and sent back home. And there's a saying,

02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:15.680
[Guest]: which goes, save us from the saviours, which is what the sex workers movement says, which

02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:21.440
[Guest]: is that basically this assumption is false, that all of us want to be rescued and taken

02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:27.840
[Guest]: away. Many women arrive there because of violence, because of trafficking and trafficking is

02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:34.800
[Guest]: a reality. There is definitely a concern there. All prostitution is not trafficking. All women

02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:40.880
[Guest]: in sex work have not been trafficked. Women have the ability to consent and be there.

02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:47.160
[Guest]: These are adult women for the most part. But adult women are not given agency, which was

02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:53.080
[Guest]: saying there is this assumption that adult women cannot be trusted on their own. And

02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:57.920
[Guest]: I saw that in the courts and the kind of judgments that courts gave when there were raids and

02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:05.480
[Guest]: women, even women who had been brought by families, by husbands and so on, the court

02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:11.200
[Guest]: mandated that they be returned to those very families, those very husbands, because it's

02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:17.560
[Guest]: like they don't believe that it is possible for a woman to be outside the family system

02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:22.920
[Guest]: or the courts. So if a woman vehemently says, you know, I'm not going to go back, then they

02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:26.960
[Guest]: will put her in a shelter home and they will keep her until she signs, until a guardian

02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:35.120
[Guest]: comes and sort of releases. And these are adult women. So I mean, I have seen the harm

02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:43.420
[Guest]: that this blanket trafficking architecture of laws and this belief that every this conflation

02:48:43.420 --> 02:48:50.400
[Guest]: of trafficking and prostitution has done. And so I find it, I find that position to

02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:57.920
[Guest]: be extremely problematic. This idea that women cannot consent to practicing sex work.

02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:01.940
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, in fact, you know, you write early in your book, quote, the bogey of trafficking

02:49:01.940 --> 02:49:07.400
[Amit Varma]: has resulted in several hardcore anti-trafficking laws and task forces that have been critiqued

02:49:07.400 --> 02:49:12.540
[Amit Varma]: as essentially ploys to push back against migration, especially of women, and pursue

02:49:12.540 --> 02:49:17.840
[Amit Varma]: abolitionist motives that in practice infringe on human rights. And you give a demonstration

02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:22.320
[Amit Varma]: of this in this great chapter where you talk about raids and rescues, often involving savior

02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:26.760
[Amit Varma]: NGO members, as you put it. And in that you write, several organizations reported that

02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:32.120
[Amit Varma]: the police use violence during these raids, arbitrarily detained women found in the raid

02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:36.520
[Amit Varma]: locations, mistook children of prostitutes for minors in prostitution and took them away

02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:41.120
[Amit Varma]: and continued the raid, even in the absence of minors or cross border girls. In fact,

02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:45.840
[Amit Varma]: raids became part of everyday life in the red light area, a terrible occupational hazard,

02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:50.440
[Amit Varma]: which left many of the girls in police lockups for a day or two in court for another, and

02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:55.240
[Amit Varma]: then back to work as usual, once someone came to bail them out or once assigned an undertaking

02:49:55.240 --> 02:50:00.160
[Amit Varma]: or paid the local police to let them go. And there's a TIL here which is similar to a TIL

02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:05.880
[Amit Varma]: Rukmini gave me in my episode with her, where Rukmini pointed out that many of these so

02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:10.560
[Amit Varma]: called rape cases that are filed are actually, you know, where the boy has run away with

02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:14.400
[Amit Varma]: the girl and the family is against it for caste reasons or whatever reasons and they

02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:19.760
[Amit Varma]: file a case. And actually it is a family that is a problem. It is not the boy or the girl.

02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:26.800
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, the TIL that I got from here is that when there are cases of actual coercion

02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:31.760
[Amit Varma]: putting you know, throwing women into prostitution, it is not from so called criminal networks

02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:36.880
[Amit Varma]: or gangs. It is from the family themselves, from the parents or the husband or whatever.

02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:42.460
[Amit Varma]: So this whole notion that we rescue a woman and we send her back to the family is compounding

02:50:42.460 --> 02:50:47.200
[Amit Varma]: the crime in a massive way, doesn't help the women. And what you point out that adult women

02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:54.120
[Amit Varma]: being forced to stay in shelter homes until a guardian comes and signs, that's equal to

02:50:54.120 --> 02:51:01.040
[Amit Varma]: abduction, imprisonment, whatever you call it. It's just, you know, it's incredibly horrifying.

02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:07.320
[Amit Varma]: So that was sort of one of the TILs I got out of this. And I'm just thinking aloud here

02:51:07.320 --> 02:51:13.120
[Amit Varma]: of morality, you know, when it comes to ethics, there are a number of questions which are

02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:17.560
[Amit Varma]: known as icky questions, icky thought experiments, which I'm sure you must have heard of, like

02:51:17.560 --> 02:51:21.880
[Amit Varma]: for example, here's a thought experiment. There's a man, he's going to eat a chicken.

02:51:21.880 --> 02:51:26.120
[Amit Varma]: So he kills a chicken, and he's going to cut it up and cook it for dinner. But before that,

02:51:26.120 --> 02:51:30.880
[Amit Varma]: he has sex with the chicken. Is it morally wrong or right? And most people will intuitively

02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:35.680
[Amit Varma]: say that of course it is wrong. But if you try to rationally explain why it is wrong,

02:51:35.680 --> 02:51:39.040
[Amit Varma]: if it's okay to kill the chicken, okay to cut it up and eat it, why not do whatever

02:51:39.040 --> 02:51:44.620
[Amit Varma]: he's doing? There's no answer to that. Another category of icky problem is that, let us say

02:51:44.620 --> 02:51:49.560
[Amit Varma]: that there is a brother and a sister and they're both adults. And they don't want to have kids,

02:51:49.560 --> 02:51:53.320
[Amit Varma]: but they want to have sex with each other. Is it right or wrong? And again, the instinctive

02:51:53.320 --> 02:51:58.080
[Amit Varma]: response is to say, of course it is wrong. But if you are rationally asked to justify

02:51:58.080 --> 02:52:02.960
[Amit Varma]: it, you know, it's very difficult to do so. And I think this whole stigmatization of sex

02:52:02.960 --> 02:52:08.480
[Amit Varma]: work seems to fall in that category that there is this instinctive repulsion to the thought,

02:52:08.480 --> 02:52:14.000
[Amit Varma]: maybe it's an instinct that we've evolved to have for whatever reasons. But, you know,

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:18.720
[Amit Varma]: rationally, I think it is really impossible to explain why sex work should be wrong. Like

02:52:18.720 --> 02:52:23.040
[Amit Varma]: even what you pointed out about escort saying that, hey, but we are not sex workers. And

02:52:23.040 --> 02:52:27.440
[Amit Varma]: I think even that is kind of unjustified. They're looking down on sex workers. Why?

02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:31.880
[Amit Varma]: Why would you need to say that we are not them? There's nothing wrong with them in that

02:52:31.880 --> 02:52:36.960
[Amit Varma]: sense. So I'm just sorry, I'm just thinking aloud. And what are your sort of thoughts

02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:41.600
[Amit Varma]: on the morality of this? Because obviously, the obvious reason for why sex workers are

02:52:41.600 --> 02:52:45.680
[Amit Varma]: looked down on is because men want to control women's sexuality, because it is a threat

02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:51.520
[Amit Varma]: to them. What are your thoughts on, you know, just our social outlook on this?

02:52:51.520 --> 02:53:01.320
[Guest]: Yeah, the moral framework is. So it's the same moral framework that says that, you know,

02:53:01.320 --> 02:53:08.280
[Guest]: men should not wear certain kinds of clothes or, you know, it's the, as you said, the,

02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:14.920
[Guest]: you know, the aim is to control women's sexuality or find it threatening, etc, etc. It's on

02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:20.400
[Guest]: that continuum, this moral framework. And in fact, in Mannequin, I have a device called

02:53:20.400 --> 02:53:27.960
[Guest]: a stigmometer that I use to, which is like basically put, you know, the nun at one end

02:53:27.960 --> 02:53:32.680
[Guest]: and the sex worker at the other, and then see the various levels of stigma that are

02:53:32.680 --> 02:53:43.640
[Guest]: related to actually sexuality. So stigma and sexuality being related completely. I find

02:53:43.640 --> 02:53:53.720
[Guest]: that in reality, so this is a narrative, right, that society has. But within that narrative,

02:53:53.720 --> 02:53:58.960
[Guest]: there are nuances. And within that narrative, there are humanizing of those experiences.

02:53:58.960 --> 02:54:05.600
[Guest]: So all our films, all our literature, we have the humane sex worker with the heart of gold,

02:54:05.600 --> 02:54:12.240
[Guest]: who sacrifices for the hero or whatever, you know. So we have enough depictions around

02:54:12.240 --> 02:54:21.480
[Guest]: us to actually humanize and make it possible to have empathy and to accommodate different

02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:28.880
[Guest]: kinds of moralities, understanding the circumstances and contexts where people are coming from.

02:54:28.880 --> 02:54:33.920
[Guest]: So in the reality, I mean, so this is the broader narrative. But then when you go into

02:54:33.920 --> 02:54:40.320
[Guest]: the real stories of people, these hardcore positions are not there, I find, you know.

02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:47.560
[Guest]: So there is, you know, those who, this gentleman who is a service provider and he said, you

02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:53.400
[Guest]: know, when I entered, when I started, I never thought that I would find such nice people,

02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:58.040
[Guest]: you know, this gentleman in one of my interviews said to me. And I thought that was such a

02:54:58.040 --> 02:55:07.640
[Guest]: nice reflection from him that, you know, he was really being honest and saying that, look,

02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:14.040
[Guest]: I never thought that there'll be such nice people who will be doing transactional sex.

02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:21.160
[Guest]: So when it comes to real people, then these narratives don't really apply. And that's

02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:27.160
[Guest]: our only hope, actually, that one person at a time and in all the interviews, you'll find

02:55:27.160 --> 02:55:35.480
[Guest]: that these are the transactions that take place are driven by fantasy, by desire, by

02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:45.440
[Guest]: an appreciation of, by giving themselves permission to do something that society does not really

02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:52.040
[Guest]: allow them to do, whether it is they're seeking loneliness, they're seeking friendships. Sometimes

02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:57.800
[Guest]: it's a financial decision, they're seeking money, they're seeking travel companions,

02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:04.400
[Guest]: you know, it's not always the transactions are not always in cash. There are travels,

02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:09.120
[Guest]: there are like, you know, people paying for each other's tickets, there is networks, which

02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:14.920
[Guest]: in Bombay for people who come to Bombay, it's very important to have networks, friendships

02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:22.720
[Guest]: that are sort of no, no strings attached. And they are a place where you can see, you

02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:27.320
[Guest]: can discover your sexuality, explore your sexuality and discover yourself a third domain,

02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:32.200
[Guest]: you know, which is the personal, which Paramita Vohra actually, she talks about the private,

02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:38.440
[Guest]: the public and the personal, which is separate from the private and the public. And if I

02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:43.680
[Guest]: take that a little further, then, you know, we all have public personas, we have our private,

02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:50.520
[Guest]: which is our private selves. But even that private self is performing a social persona,

02:56:50.520 --> 02:56:55.680
[Guest]: right? So we are in marriages, we have children, we have relationships, we have families and

02:56:55.680 --> 02:57:01.200
[Guest]: so on and so forth. And there's a third domain, which is what our fantasies, our desires,

02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:07.520
[Guest]: what we what we want for ourselves, you know, and that's the space. That's the third axis,

02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:13.720
[Guest]: I think, that a lot of my interviewees, I feel place their seeking or providing sexual

02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:22.000
[Guest]: services in, you know, trying to fulfil the fantasies and their desires. And this is a,

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:28.880
[Guest]: this one here, one has heard of in, in discourses around men who have sex with men, MSM, which

02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:35.360
[Guest]: is a category, you know, which in HIV AIDS sort of parlance. And here we have men who

02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:41.720
[Guest]: don't identify as gay. And they have their lives, their social personas as married men,

02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:48.240
[Guest]: heterosexual men living, you know, regular straight lives. But they also have sex with

02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:53.160
[Guest]: men, which is that their personal domain. And then it doesn't contradict each other.

02:57:53.160 --> 02:58:01.640
[Guest]: Their identity is, as MSM does not contradict their identity as householder, you know, so

02:58:01.640 --> 02:58:09.920
[Guest]: it's a, yeah, I think my big headline point is that when it comes to macro individual

02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:13.160
[Guest]: lives, these narratives don't necessarily work.

02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:18.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, I love that point. And, you know, one thought that I've, that first struck me

02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:23.080
[Amit Varma]: when I did an episode with Anshul Malhotra, who had written that book on partition and

02:58:23.080 --> 02:58:28.520
[Amit Varma]: she's out with a new one now, but I'm referring to the older one where she had sort of interviewed

02:58:28.520 --> 02:58:34.200
[Amit Varma]: people who'd carried objects with them. But as an aside, she spoke about how one of the

02:58:34.200 --> 02:58:39.520
[Amit Varma]: stories that a person told, a Hindu who had come from Pakistan, if I remember correctly,

02:58:39.520 --> 02:58:44.320
[Amit Varma]: perhaps from Baluchistan, was that every day before partition, these people would gather

02:58:44.320 --> 02:58:47.680
[Amit Varma]: in the village square and they were all friends and they were all a community and they were

02:58:47.680 --> 02:58:52.280
[Amit Varma]: all good with each other and so on and so forth. And they would listen to the radio.

02:58:52.280 --> 02:58:57.360
[Amit Varma]: And as more and more news came of the impending partition and of the horrors being committed,

02:58:57.360 --> 02:59:03.040
[Amit Varma]: they began to treat each other sort of differently. And there were two forces playing out and

02:59:03.040 --> 02:59:07.080
[Amit Varma]: one is the concrete that you see these people around you in the flesh and blood. And the

02:59:07.080 --> 02:59:11.960
[Amit Varma]: other is the power of the abstract idea. In this case, the dangerous, toxic one of that

02:59:11.960 --> 02:59:17.000
[Amit Varma]: particular kind of nationalism. And another illustration Anshul gave of this was, though

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:21.960
[Amit Varma]: the formulation is sort of something that I came up with. So she didn't put it in this

02:59:21.960 --> 02:59:27.840
[Amit Varma]: way. But it was interesting that she was interviewing a couple in Pakistan about their journey that

02:59:27.840 --> 02:59:32.320
[Amit Varma]: they had made from India. And they were ranting against Hindus. And after a while, one of

02:59:32.320 --> 02:59:36.880
[Amit Varma]: them realized she's Hindu. And he said, bete aap aise nahi ho, aap theek ho. You know,

02:59:36.880 --> 02:59:41.560
[Amit Varma]: so in the concrete, it's okay. But in the abstract, it's a problem. And this is something

02:59:41.560 --> 02:59:47.960
[Amit Varma]: I think about a bit that a lot of India's problems are because of dangerous abstract

02:59:47.960 --> 02:59:54.560
[Amit Varma]: notions like nationalism, or tradition, or religious purity, or whatever the case might

02:59:54.560 --> 02:59:59.880
[Amit Varma]: be, which drive us away from each other. But in the concrete, very often, when we come

02:59:59.880 --> 03:00:04.960
[Amit Varma]: across the other, we are perfectly happy to be good with them to be friendly with them.

03:00:04.960 --> 03:00:08.680
[Amit Varma]: Like so often, it's so common to find a Hindu bigot say something like, but I have Muslim

03:00:08.680 --> 03:00:15.800
[Amit Varma]: friends. And, you know, just illustrating that. So what you spoke about, you know, that

03:00:15.800 --> 03:00:20.800
[Amit Varma]: these notions might be there that it is immoral, or it is corrupting our culture. But if you

03:00:20.800 --> 03:00:26.280
[Amit Varma]: actually, you know, if you concretize it, in a sense, you know, you'd get a different

03:00:26.280 --> 03:00:31.560
[Amit Varma]: notion of it. If you come across these people in the flesh and realize that here, they just,

03:00:31.560 --> 03:00:38.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, it's no different from someone selling a shoe as you put it elsewhere. And just thinking

03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:46.000
[Amit Varma]: aloud, I'm also wondering, you mentioned transactions. And I'm just wondering that if all relationships

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:51.440
[Amit Varma]: are transactional in some way or the other. And the problem people have with sex work

03:00:51.440 --> 03:00:56.720
[Amit Varma]: is that it commits a vulgarity of making this overt. You're revealing to people a part of

03:00:56.720 --> 03:01:01.880
[Amit Varma]: themselves and a part of human nature that they would rather elide over and gloss over

03:01:01.880 --> 03:01:07.400
[Amit Varma]: with some kind of covering. So that's, I mean, I'm just thinking aloud. What are your thoughts

03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:21.560
[Guest]: on that? Yeah, I think that's a good observation. And I think I allude to it when I talk about

03:01:21.560 --> 03:01:27.320
[Guest]: the comparison with the housewife, the labor that housewives do. And you know, a lot of

03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:33.600
[Guest]: attention that's been given to unpaid care work, etc. But not so much to the sexual labor

03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:42.680
[Guest]: that housewives are expected to perform. And it's an unpopular thing to say honestly, right?

03:01:42.680 --> 03:01:49.440
[Guest]: It's not nice to say that lovemaking within marriage can be a chore. You know, you don't

03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:57.000
[Guest]: want to say that because marriage is also wanted as something that is, it's idealized

03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:05.240
[Guest]: and it's idolized. And critiquing marriage is dangerous also because it challenges, it

03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:12.760
[Guest]: shows a mirror to ourselves. I think that's the danger. It's really we're putting a mirror

03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:16.960
[Guest]: up to ourselves and our relationships. And then we are forced to really think of our

03:02:16.960 --> 03:02:25.720
[Guest]: relationships in those terms. But it is also if we think with the scholarship, with the

03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:33.160
[Guest]: lens of scholarship, then it is an extension of the labor. If we are thinking of paid labor,

03:02:33.160 --> 03:02:43.800
[Guest]: etc. as you know, as household labor being, you know, chores, then all kinds of work that

03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:52.680
[Guest]: can be contracted out. We see it as, it can be labor, right? In terms of scholarship.

03:02:52.680 --> 03:02:59.920
[Guest]: The girlfriend experience, which is what, you know, Elizabeth Bernstein, who's a scholar,

03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:06.760
[Guest]: what she calls the girlfriend experience that has revealed more explicitly how scripts of

03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:14.480
[Guest]: transactional sex are mimicking romantic relationships. You know, that has, I think, brought these

03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:22.800
[Guest]: ideas out even more that the girl, you can buy the girlfriend experience, which means

03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:28.680
[Guest]: that everything is for sale. I think there's, it's also to do with the broader commodification

03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:36.160
[Guest]: of everything in the current economic framework, right? There is a sense that everything can

03:03:36.160 --> 03:03:45.280
[Guest]: be, has a monetary value attached to it. And so in that context, it doesn't seem much of

03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:54.120
[Guest]: a stretch to think of everything in those terms. The harm that it causes to not think

03:03:54.120 --> 03:03:59.240
[Guest]: of it in these terms is that, you know, then it becomes a duty, right? Then what we were

03:03:59.240 --> 03:04:06.240
[Guest]: talking about at the beginning, this idea of marital duties, then becomes solidified,

03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:13.440
[Guest]: right? Then it becomes like, it's a duty rather than labor. Also, what do you do with that

03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:20.120
[Guest]: insight? Honestly, you know, what, how is it going to help our relationships or is it

03:04:20.120 --> 03:04:27.400
[Guest]: going to, what's the point of coming up with this point? Is something that I would ask

03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:32.400
[Guest]: myself, even though I've come up with a point, I'm like now, okay, now what do I do with

03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:36.960
[Guest]: this? And maybe it will take me some time. I cannot answer you right now, but it'll take

03:04:36.960 --> 03:04:46.160
[Guest]: me some time to really think about it and understand that will this enable people to

03:04:46.160 --> 03:04:53.440
[Guest]: have more respect, say for the escort or for the sex worker? Will they be able to associate

03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:58.920
[Guest]: themselves? Will they be able to then have some empathy? Will it open some bridge between

03:04:58.920 --> 03:05:04.520
[Guest]: each person and a sex worker when they realize that, okay, this is not so far from my life

03:05:04.520 --> 03:05:10.400
[Guest]: at all. It's not something that happens in red light areas in Kamathipura or Sonagachi,

03:05:10.400 --> 03:05:17.240
[Guest]: but you know, there is a nuance here that is applicable to relations between partners

03:05:17.240 --> 03:05:22.400
[Guest]: everywhere that transactional sex happens, not just in those areas, but you know, there

03:05:22.400 --> 03:05:26.160
[Guest]: is something like transactional sex that is happening and we should start speaking about

03:05:26.160 --> 03:05:34.160
[Guest]: it so that we really open up the contours, the inequality that maybe it's an opportunity

03:05:34.160 --> 03:05:39.960
[Guest]: to actually have more equal conversations, equal relationships, talk about consent, talk

03:05:39.960 --> 03:05:44.400
[Guest]: about better relations.

03:05:44.400 --> 03:05:48.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, the part of your book that I was really struck by and you mentioned fantasies

03:05:48.160 --> 03:05:53.800
[Amit Varma]: is this excellent passage where you speak about, in your chapter called the cruisers,

03:05:53.800 --> 03:05:58.720
[Amit Varma]: about this guy called Vijay, where you write, quote, Vijay's best experience was when he

03:05:58.720 --> 03:06:03.360
[Amit Varma]: was asked to play out the fantasy of a woman who responded to his ad around the mythical

03:06:03.360 --> 03:06:07.400
[Amit Varma]: romantic first night after marriage or the suhaag raat in which they dressed up as groom

03:06:07.400 --> 03:06:11.840
[Amit Varma]: and bride. We went out of town. This is him talking now. We went out of town. She wore

03:06:11.840 --> 03:06:16.680
[Amit Varma]: a red saree. The bed was decorated like that with flowers and all. I wore a kurta pajama.

03:06:16.680 --> 03:06:22.080
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote. And I found this both charming, interesting, poignant, a whole bunch of things.

03:06:22.080 --> 03:06:26.400
[Amit Varma]: Even the girlfriend experience is an acting out of that kind of fantasy. In a separate

03:06:26.400 --> 03:06:31.240
[Amit Varma]: place, you've spoken about how escorts advertise themselves and how the two or three lines

03:06:31.240 --> 03:06:35.160
[Amit Varma]: they'll write about themselves will have both the whore and the Madonna included, you know,

03:06:35.160 --> 03:06:41.200
[Amit Varma]: both sides of that. And it just struck me that there is actually a deep kind of honesty

03:06:41.200 --> 03:06:46.960
[Amit Varma]: to this, where both people know exactly what the other wants from them. And that is a deep

03:06:46.960 --> 03:06:52.660
[Amit Varma]: kind of honesty, perhaps absent in most relationships. Again, I'm not insisting that all relationships

03:06:52.660 --> 03:06:59.040
[Amit Varma]: are necessarily transactional. But at one level, it might well be the case and is worth

03:06:59.040 --> 03:07:06.440
[Amit Varma]: thinking about whether only we exist for ourselves. And everyone else is a character in a play

03:07:06.440 --> 03:07:11.200
[Amit Varma]: or a prop in a play. And we are the central character and we are everything. But we are

03:07:11.200 --> 03:07:17.300
[Amit Varma]: always sort of in denial of this. And in every relationship, therefore, two people are never

03:07:17.300 --> 03:07:21.800
[Amit Varma]: completely honest with each other about what they may want or what they may expect, except

03:07:21.800 --> 03:07:26.920
[Amit Varma]: in the most healthy relationships, obviously. And conventional forms of relationships like

03:07:26.920 --> 03:07:32.520
[Amit Varma]: marriages, for example, get in the way of these honest, this kind of honesty, where,

03:07:32.520 --> 03:07:38.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, you kind of live a life of denial of all your life. So in that sense, in a sort

03:07:38.640 --> 03:07:43.480
[Amit Varma]: of a relationship between an escort or a cruiser and their client or whatever, there is that

03:07:43.480 --> 03:07:49.440
[Amit Varma]: sense that there is no facade, as it were, that this is the most honest kind of relationship

03:07:49.440 --> 03:07:54.200
[Amit Varma]: that you can find. And therefore, that is something almost to be admired rather than

03:07:54.200 --> 03:07:58.200
[Amit Varma]: looked down upon. And again, I'm totally thinking aloud, but just throwing these thoughts out

03:07:58.200 --> 03:08:07.680
[Guest]: there for you. In the example that you offered, it should be clear that this was a male service

03:08:07.680 --> 03:08:13.240
[Guest]: provider and the client was a woman. Exactly. And this is a really new and interesting finding,

03:08:13.240 --> 03:08:18.720
[Guest]: you know, that there are women who are paying for certain kinds of services. It's also interesting.

03:08:18.720 --> 03:08:24.680
[Guest]: I also love that example, that her fantasy was to have a Suhagrath as a single woman.

03:08:24.680 --> 03:08:29.840
[Guest]: She wanted to experience a Suhagrath, which shows how deeply culturally coded our desires

03:08:29.840 --> 03:08:43.000
[Guest]: are and how we imagine romance to be in a certain way. So I love that example, too.

03:08:43.000 --> 03:09:04.880
[Guest]: I find that it is honest, but it is also secret. So then how do you reconcile these two things?

03:09:04.880 --> 03:09:08.300
[Amit Varma]: Have you read this book called Everybody Lies, Big Data, New Data and What the Internet Can

03:09:08.300 --> 03:09:14.560
[Amit Varma]: Tell Us About Who We Really Are by Seth Stevens-Davidowitz? So it's a book where this researcher basically

03:09:14.560 --> 03:09:18.520
[Amit Varma]: got access to a whole bunch of data from Google and several others about what people are searching

03:09:18.520 --> 03:09:23.400
[Amit Varma]: for. And his premise, and I agree with it completely, and it's a brilliant thought,

03:09:23.400 --> 03:09:27.640
[Amit Varma]: is that people are most themselves when they think no one is looking. And when you're searching

03:09:27.640 --> 03:09:32.400
[Amit Varma]: for something on Google, perhaps in an incognito window, you think no one is looking and therefore

03:09:32.400 --> 03:09:36.720
[Amit Varma]: you are most yourself. And the searches are very revealing. Like the most bizarre thing

03:09:36.720 --> 03:09:41.560
[Amit Varma]: about India, for example, is that India and Bangladesh, and in particular India, more

03:09:41.560 --> 03:09:46.680
[Amit Varma]: than any other country in the world, adult males have this breastfeeding fantasy, which

03:09:46.680 --> 03:09:53.400
[Amit Varma]: is like completely out of whack and insane. And there are a ton of sort of other insights

03:09:53.400 --> 03:09:59.560
[Amit Varma]: like this about what people are really like. And you know, even in the context of fantasies,

03:09:59.560 --> 03:10:04.440
[Amit Varma]: for example, I was reading what you had written about it and I recognized that there are certain

03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:09.400
[Amit Varma]: categories in just what you describe and what the people you speak to chat with you about.

03:10:09.400 --> 03:10:14.160
[Amit Varma]: There are categories. If you look at erotic fiction, for example, on sites like Late Erotica

03:10:14.160 --> 03:10:19.240
[Amit Varma]: or if you look at the categories of porn there, for example, there's the cuckolding fantasy

03:10:19.240 --> 03:10:24.160
[Amit Varma]: where, you know, this male escort goes to a couple and while the husband watches TV,

03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:28.640
[Amit Varma]: he has sex with the wife and after that he's worried about whether she really wanted it.

03:10:28.640 --> 03:10:32.840
[Amit Varma]: And he asked, so was it good for you? And she says, yeah, kind of, but he's happy. So,

03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:38.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, and this is a whole category of erotic story out there. And, you know, and

03:10:38.480 --> 03:10:43.360
[Amit Varma]: the other categories of, and I don't know how they would play out in this kind of context,

03:10:43.360 --> 03:10:48.360
[Amit Varma]: but one in this kind of context, but one huge category out there, which according to Stephens

03:10:48.360 --> 03:10:54.700
[Amit Varma]: Davidowitz is actually, you know, more popular with women than with men is non-consent. Right.

03:10:54.700 --> 03:10:59.680
[Amit Varma]: And that completely blew me away because I know the category exists, both in terms of

03:10:59.680 --> 03:11:03.800
[Amit Varma]: stories and videos and all of that. But the fact that more women would be searching for

03:11:03.800 --> 03:11:09.920
[Amit Varma]: that category than men also blew me away and so on and so forth. So it's just interesting

03:11:09.920 --> 03:11:17.680
[Amit Varma]: how, you know, in modern times, people can actually play out on their fantasies first

03:11:17.680 --> 03:11:22.200
[Amit Varma]: by getting material on it. Like in 1990, if you have some random fantasy, you're not going

03:11:22.200 --> 03:11:28.040
[Amit Varma]: to be, there's no internet, you have absolutely no access, you don't get to explore it, you

03:11:28.040 --> 03:11:32.760
[Amit Varma]: don't get to go deeper. Here, number one, at one level, you get to go deeper in terms

03:11:32.760 --> 03:11:36.920
[Amit Varma]: of searching for it, finding stories and videos on it, and realizing with a shock that there

03:11:36.920 --> 03:11:42.540
[Amit Varma]: are millions of people like you who might have whatever specific fetish that you do.

03:11:42.540 --> 03:11:46.720
[Amit Varma]: And at another level, which I discovered, which I read about in your book, is that you

03:11:46.720 --> 03:11:51.400
[Amit Varma]: can also act out on these fantasies. And it's also very sad at one level, like at another

03:11:51.400 --> 03:11:55.440
[Amit Varma]: place you have sex workers talking about quote unquote, the game of love, where they say

03:11:55.440 --> 03:12:00.360
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, they keep coming back because they think we love them. And that's also so

03:12:00.360 --> 03:12:05.920
[Amit Varma]: kind of poignant and tragic at a human level that I just think that there's kind of so

03:12:05.920 --> 03:12:12.760
[Amit Varma]: much going on here. So what was it like for you to speak to all of these people and have

03:12:12.760 --> 03:12:17.640
[Amit Varma]: those TILs in real time in the first person as they, you know, talk about all of this

03:12:17.640 --> 03:12:21.680
[Amit Varma]: to you? You know, what was that experience like? And what are the other TILs that you

03:12:21.680 --> 03:12:27.600
[Amit Varma]: have, which you, you know, I may not have noticed or may not be in the book?

03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:34.240
[Guest]: I will paraphrase the gentleman who I interviewed that I didn't think they'd be such nice people.

03:12:34.240 --> 03:12:43.160
[Guest]: But yeah, they were all, I think I, you know, the locations where I met many of the men

03:12:43.160 --> 03:12:49.280
[Guest]: I interviewed was interesting. So there were some in BKC, and they came in corporate blues.

03:12:49.280 --> 03:12:56.480
[Guest]: And, you know, there were some in, you know, coffee shops, there were, you know, men who

03:12:56.480 --> 03:13:02.480
[Guest]: worked in say, you know, shops, etc, who I would meet at maybe say, a McDonald's next

03:13:02.480 --> 03:13:09.660
[Guest]: to a station, you know, some places like that, young college, just out of college, maybe

03:13:09.660 --> 03:13:14.040
[Guest]: working boys, there would be these are the people I met, and there would be those who

03:13:14.040 --> 03:13:23.320
[Guest]: I had email interviews with. So there were really a range, a range of men, I wish I had

03:13:23.320 --> 03:13:27.520
[Guest]: been able to interview more women escorts, it was a really hard experience getting access

03:13:27.520 --> 03:13:32.440
[Guest]: to women escorts for various reasons. And I think I detailed that in the book. But,

03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:37.000
[Guest]: you know, the interview that I did do with a very long interview over two days, which

03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:43.320
[Guest]: was also a really wonderful experience. And it sort of showed me, you know, like she would

03:13:43.320 --> 03:13:47.640
[Guest]: take a break to have lunch with her mother, I would take a break to have lunch with my

03:13:47.640 --> 03:13:55.920
[Guest]: kids. And just the whole domestic domesticity of life was always interwoven with the conversations

03:13:55.920 --> 03:14:02.280
[Guest]: we were having, which were very explicit, and quite challenging also, you know, whereas,

03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:08.880
[Guest]: where she would also say things to provoke and challenge me. I would also be a bit disturbed

03:14:08.880 --> 03:14:16.760
[Guest]: by her casual acceptance that rape happens in our work lives, it's occupational hazard.

03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:21.440
[Guest]: And you know, we, the best thing to do is to calm a man down and continue, because nobody's

03:14:21.440 --> 03:14:26.480
[Guest]: no policeman is going to believe me if I, if I call them, and it's just going to threaten

03:14:26.480 --> 03:14:35.720
[Guest]: my life. So better to actually just handle it and move on. And so there were, I think,

03:14:35.720 --> 03:14:47.280
[Guest]: a range of, of sort of experiences that I had. I think sex work research is, is already

03:14:47.280 --> 03:14:55.680
[Guest]: a little difficult, because it's, it's what we call shadow research, right? It's difficult

03:14:55.680 --> 03:15:03.160
[Guest]: to access both sex workers as well as clients. And the, because of I mean, for sex workers,

03:15:03.160 --> 03:15:07.640
[Guest]: it's usually because of what we what I say are the three axes of their marginalization,

03:15:07.640 --> 03:15:13.240
[Guest]: which is the illegality of their work or the perceived illegality of their work, the informality

03:15:13.240 --> 03:15:19.700
[Guest]: of the labor, which makes it difficult to actually find them because informal work is

03:15:19.700 --> 03:15:26.840
[Guest]: always in a flow. And the third is the morality. So these three axes are sort of this is the

03:15:26.840 --> 03:15:35.200
[Guest]: triangle within which you do sex work research. And so it is hard to do sex work research.

03:15:35.200 --> 03:15:39.560
[Guest]: There's also other things like how can you expect people to talk about their lives if

03:15:39.560 --> 03:15:45.920
[Guest]: you yourself don't open yourself up and make yourself vulnerable also to thinking about

03:15:45.920 --> 03:15:50.200
[Guest]: these things and to sharing parts of your life also. So there's always a moment where

03:15:50.200 --> 03:15:54.520
[Guest]: you ask, do you want to ask me any questions? And they ask you a lot of questions about

03:15:54.520 --> 03:16:02.000
[Guest]: your life. And there is an exchange that really makes it possible for us to arrive at a place

03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:09.320
[Guest]: of comfort and an equal level of vulnerability, you know, that both of us have then. So these

03:16:09.320 --> 03:16:17.480
[Guest]: are things you learn over time. So that's not that you learn, you know, you learn how

03:16:17.480 --> 03:16:23.080
[Guest]: to handle tensions, how to handle questions, how to make people feel at ease. And you know

03:16:23.080 --> 03:16:28.080
[Guest]: that really well, you're an interviewer yourself and your interviews are so personal. So there

03:16:28.080 --> 03:16:37.120
[Guest]: is a process to arrive there. I think in this case, I had I built on several years of experience

03:16:37.120 --> 03:16:43.680
[Guest]: and I was also much older. So I have done interviews with clients in my 20s. And at

03:16:43.680 --> 03:16:49.040
[Guest]: that time, I, you know, the strategy was that go with an older woman, as a younger woman,

03:16:49.040 --> 03:16:55.960
[Guest]: go with an older woman. And but this, I mean, so many years later as an older woman, I felt

03:16:55.960 --> 03:17:04.680
[Guest]: I could sort of go into these on my own. There's also often, you know, a sexual tension, right?

03:17:04.680 --> 03:17:11.280
[Guest]: Because it's like there, they will think that you or you imagine that maybe they're looking

03:17:11.280 --> 03:17:17.040
[Guest]: at you in a sexualized manner, which may be so, but you know what, where does that not

03:17:17.040 --> 03:17:23.440
[Guest]: happen, honestly. So those are little hurdles you get, which are related to doing research

03:17:23.440 --> 03:17:28.680
[Guest]: on sexuality. And you learn over time.

03:17:28.680 --> 03:17:34.080
[Amit Varma]: You know, we discussed about how there are feminist debates on it. And, you know, that

03:17:34.080 --> 03:17:39.720
[Amit Varma]: debate is progressing in different directions. But the law seems to sort of look at prostitution

03:17:39.720 --> 03:17:45.200
[Amit Varma]: always in the worst possible ways. You know, we've spoken about the bogey of trafficking

03:17:45.200 --> 03:17:51.400
[Amit Varma]: as you eloquently put it and, you know, the result of criminalizing prostitution and I've

03:17:51.400 --> 03:17:56.000
[Amit Varma]: in fact written before about how we should decriminalize victimless crimes of which sex

03:17:56.000 --> 03:18:01.400
[Amit Varma]: work certainly is one. And you've written in your book, and I'll read this passage out.

03:18:01.400 --> 03:18:06.120
[Amit Varma]: Priscilla Pyatt and Deborah Ward's study in Australia looks at violence against sex workers

03:18:06.120 --> 03:18:10.520
[Amit Varma]: in different locations and the risks they face from a public health perspective. They

03:18:10.520 --> 03:18:15.480
[Amit Varma]: find that a legal brothel provides the safest environment for sex workers and that an organized

03:18:15.480 --> 03:18:20.160
[Amit Varma]: sex industry worker has a positive attitude to their work and workplace and reports consistent

03:18:20.160 --> 03:18:24.920
[Amit Varma]: condom use. The main risks identified by the study are client violence and client resistance

03:18:24.920 --> 03:18:30.800
[Amit Varma]: to condom use. For some, the problems associated with homelessness, drug use and extreme social

03:18:30.800 --> 03:18:38.680
[Amit Varma]: isolation far outweighed the risks associated with sex work, stop quote. And, you know,

03:18:38.680 --> 03:18:43.680
[Amit Varma]: and in India, especially, you've spoken at described at length in this book, how police

03:18:43.680 --> 03:18:49.400
[Amit Varma]: will typically treat sex workers as quote, either victims or criminals. So just in terms

03:18:49.400 --> 03:18:55.200
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, the law always is one step behind society in this sense, right? So even if social

03:18:55.200 --> 03:18:59.320
[Amit Varma]: attitudes are gradually changing, and I'm not sure they're anywhere close to where there

03:18:59.320 --> 03:19:03.200
[Amit Varma]: should be, I think those stigmas attached to sex workers are still there. But the law

03:19:03.200 --> 03:19:09.680
[Amit Varma]: is a step further behind in this particular case. How much of an impediment is that to

03:19:09.680 --> 03:19:14.560
[Amit Varma]: actually getting things to change on the ground? Like you describe this raid on the Simplex

03:19:14.560 --> 03:19:20.680
[Amit Varma]: mansion, for example, where, you know, the cops raided this place, arrested everyone,

03:19:20.680 --> 03:19:25.560
[Amit Varma]: including alleged customers. And then they went to the police station and they made these

03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:30.280
[Amit Varma]: alleged customers, many of them stripped to their underwear, which reminded me of this

03:19:30.280 --> 03:19:34.360
[Amit Varma]: recent incident that happened with journalists, if you read about that a couple of days ago,

03:19:34.360 --> 03:19:38.680
[Amit Varma]: where these journalists had gone to the police station to protest against an activist's arrest,

03:19:38.680 --> 03:19:41.520
[Amit Varma]: and they were all taken and stripped to their underwear, and the photo was made viral on

03:19:41.520 --> 03:19:47.560
[Amit Varma]: social media, which is again, an illustration of how the state treats us as subjects and

03:19:47.560 --> 03:19:52.680
[Amit Varma]: not citizens. You know, in terms of what the police is like, we're really not even forget

03:19:52.680 --> 03:19:57.520
[Amit Varma]: 20th century, we're in the 19th century, you know, 19th century, we are following the spirit

03:19:57.520 --> 03:20:03.880
[Amit Varma]: of the first penal code that the British set for us. It's just outrageous. So what's kind

03:20:03.880 --> 03:20:08.080
[Amit Varma]: of your thought on that? Because it is not just society and social attitudes towards

03:20:08.080 --> 03:20:14.560
[Amit Varma]: sex workers. It's a law and this law is often a greater danger to them than the alleged

03:20:14.560 --> 03:20:18.240
[Amit Varma]: criminal gangs who, you know, might be involved.

03:20:18.240 --> 03:20:28.880
[Guest]: Honestly, I feel a little empathetic towards the police. I mean, I and Bishakha went to

03:20:28.880 --> 03:20:33.200
[Guest]: do a little fact finding mission of our own when we read about the Simplex raid in October

03:20:33.200 --> 03:20:40.600
[Guest]: 2011 or 2012 that took place. And Simplex building is this huge building, it was known

03:20:40.600 --> 03:20:49.640
[Guest]: as a brothel near Lamington Road and sort of the edge of Kamathipura. And overnight

03:20:49.640 --> 03:20:58.280
[Guest]: 400 women were removed from that building. So that building was essentially hallowed

03:20:58.280 --> 03:21:07.240
[Guest]: and it was clearly the, I mean, there's some real estate, there's some conspiracy there,

03:21:07.240 --> 03:21:13.760
[Guest]: which led to this decision to raid that building and hollow it out completely. And when we

03:21:13.760 --> 03:21:20.480
[Guest]: went to actually visit the police and ask about the raid, the inspector talked about

03:21:20.480 --> 03:21:25.200
[Guest]: how, you know, for three days they were, he didn't sleep for three days. He was working

03:21:25.200 --> 03:21:30.360
[Guest]: nonstop for three days. He himself did not really know where the order had come from.

03:21:30.360 --> 03:21:35.280
[Guest]: You know, he was carrying out orders and they were, they came with media and the police

03:21:35.280 --> 03:21:40.080
[Guest]: came with media. It was, they didn't have enough cars to take the girls. So there would

03:21:40.080 --> 03:21:45.120
[Guest]: be one batch going and depositing girls in this police station. Then there would be,

03:21:45.120 --> 03:21:51.360
[Guest]: the car would come back, vans would be sent to carry girls to another police station.

03:21:51.360 --> 03:21:56.360
[Guest]: So it was like a, it was a massive operation, which they were ill-equipped to carry out

03:21:56.360 --> 03:22:02.840
[Guest]: actually. And they were exhausted by the end of it. And it was, I mean, if you ask them,

03:22:02.840 --> 03:22:10.320
[Guest]: why did you do it? They say, what's wrong is wrong. You know, that's their classic answer.

03:22:10.320 --> 03:22:16.240
[Guest]: But you know, they also did not have much agency in that sense. Yes, that stripping

03:22:16.240 --> 03:22:24.000
[Guest]: and, you know, stripping them to their underwear, etc. I mean, at local level, police have practices

03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:31.760
[Guest]: which are, you know, a form of just violence, right? And that's there everywhere. So I feel

03:22:31.760 --> 03:22:38.680
[Guest]: that that is very much, we have to account for those kinds of practices. Those are dependent

03:22:38.680 --> 03:22:43.080
[Guest]: on broader police reforms, really trying and understanding what is the role of police in

03:22:43.080 --> 03:22:49.520
[Guest]: society? You know, is it to do this kind of stuff? Is it, can there be a more productive

03:22:49.520 --> 03:22:57.440
[Guest]: way of policing? Right? There are those kinds of things we need to have debates about in

03:22:57.440 --> 03:23:02.640
[Guest]: our country. So it's not only specific to the issue of sex work. What is specific, I

03:23:02.640 --> 03:23:07.960
[Guest]: think, is this what you'd mentioned decriminalizing versus legalizing, which is a question that

03:23:07.960 --> 03:23:16.200
[Guest]: comes up often, you know, should prostitution be legalized? And people ask me that and I,

03:23:16.200 --> 03:23:20.280
[Guest]: and sex workers themselves feel that they don't want sex work to be legalized, because

03:23:20.280 --> 03:23:26.040
[Guest]: all that means is more surveillance by the state, you know, licenses and this and that.

03:23:26.040 --> 03:23:34.280
[Guest]: So that's not what they want. But decriminalization is very important. Because if sex work is

03:23:34.280 --> 03:23:41.680
[Guest]: decriminalized, then they can, so we have an ambiguous law where soliciting is criminalized,

03:23:41.680 --> 03:23:47.440
[Guest]: sex work per se, there's no opinion on it, because it is conflated with trafficking.

03:23:47.440 --> 03:23:53.520
[Guest]: Generally, it's not acknowledged that there are sex workers per se in law, in practice,

03:23:53.520 --> 03:23:59.760
[Guest]: of course, police know and you know, I mean, there are arrangements there are even during

03:23:59.760 --> 03:24:04.360
[Guest]: the pandemic, we had police stations offering relief to sex workers groups and so on. We

03:24:04.360 --> 03:24:11.360
[Guest]: saw that in several places at the ground level, things work in a different way. But decriminalizing

03:24:11.360 --> 03:24:18.360
[Guest]: sex work clearly would mean that sex workers can approach the police as citizens, when

03:24:18.360 --> 03:24:26.080
[Guest]: they when they experience violence, extortion, and so on. And they have a right to actually

03:24:26.080 --> 03:24:31.920
[Guest]: demand justice. And it would be the same for, for example, I spoke to you about the question

03:24:31.920 --> 03:24:35.840
[Guest]: of the escort who said that why, I mean, you know, I can't say anything, I can't do anything

03:24:35.840 --> 03:24:42.400
[Guest]: if some if a client rapes me. So it gives her the at least some leverage to approach

03:24:42.400 --> 03:24:50.520
[Guest]: a police and say that, look, I'm being violated against so. So that's the value of decriminalizing

03:24:50.520 --> 03:24:58.160
[Guest]: and it's actually a real need I feel so decriminalization I would be completely for. I feel that this

03:24:58.160 --> 03:25:07.640
[Guest]: idea of citizenship is very important. You know, because then we have to account for

03:25:07.640 --> 03:25:14.120
[Guest]: sex workers opinions or their preferences in several other domains, like for example,

03:25:14.120 --> 03:25:21.680
[Guest]: what is a safe city? You know, they should be what what is what can education for their

03:25:21.680 --> 03:25:28.480
[Guest]: children look like? I mean, there are so many areas where, you know, their citizenship is

03:25:28.480 --> 03:25:36.520
[Guest]: being not sort of met, their entitlements are not being met. There's one more thing

03:25:36.520 --> 03:25:41.200
[Guest]: I wanted to add about the comment you made about searches, you know, and what people

03:25:41.200 --> 03:25:46.280
[Guest]: search for and whether that's really who they are. I don't think it's as simple as that.

03:25:46.280 --> 03:25:53.240
[Guest]: And I'm thinking now about, you know, England in the late 90s, 2000s, when there was this

03:25:53.240 --> 03:25:58.600
[Guest]: whole how about pedophilia, you know, and there was this concern that the internet was

03:25:58.600 --> 03:26:06.000
[Guest]: corrupting people and you know, the internet was filled with pedophilics. And there would

03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:11.840
[Guest]: be men who would get arrested for searching for certain things, right? But that's the

03:26:11.840 --> 03:26:17.440
[Guest]: thing. If this if you're searching for something, it doesn't mean you've done it. So can you

03:26:17.440 --> 03:26:24.000
[Guest]: go and arrest someone or say that someone is, you know, is a pedophile, if they have

03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:30.600
[Guest]: searched for something, or if it is a fantasy, you know, there is a difference between fantasy

03:26:30.600 --> 03:26:36.280
[Guest]: and reality. And whether it is law, whether it is one another, we have to realize that

03:26:36.280 --> 03:26:41.600
[Guest]: there is a boundary there, you know, so to fantasize or to think of something, then you'll

03:26:41.600 --> 03:26:47.600
[Guest]: arrest anything you think of, then you know, you can you can't think of anything, you know,

03:26:47.600 --> 03:26:55.280
[Guest]: which is illegitimate or, you know, illegal. I absolutely agree. In fact, the sense in

03:26:55.280 --> 03:27:00.640
[Amit Varma]: which said Davidowitz was talking about all of these searches is more in a descriptive

03:27:00.640 --> 03:27:05.620
[Amit Varma]: way and not in a prescriptive or prescriptive way. So it's not that if somebody is fantasizing

03:27:05.620 --> 03:27:09.120
[Amit Varma]: about something, it is okay to therefore do that, or that person is going to go out and

03:27:09.120 --> 03:27:14.600
[Amit Varma]: do that, or that person even wants to do that. That's not the case at all. It is just that

03:27:14.600 --> 03:27:20.560
[Amit Varma]: it is it's just an interesting look at the way someone's mind is working. And it's often

03:27:20.560 --> 03:27:26.520
[Amit Varma]: more sad, like, I completely agree that we should only judge people by their actions.

03:27:26.520 --> 03:27:31.040
[Amit Varma]: Because a lot of the impulses we have are things we probably can't control. You can't

03:27:31.040 --> 03:27:35.040
[Amit Varma]: hold people responsible for the impulses or their thoughts, you can only hold them responsible

03:27:35.040 --> 03:27:39.320
[Amit Varma]: for what they actually do. So I completely agree there. So the the fascinating aspect

03:27:39.320 --> 03:27:47.260
[Amit Varma]: of your book is that it is more than describing a state of the way things are. Intimacy is

03:27:47.260 --> 03:27:53.480
[Amit Varma]: describing a way in which a particular world, a particular ecosystem has completely changed

03:27:53.480 --> 03:27:58.200
[Amit Varma]: in these times, right? And I keep thinking about how other things have changed. Like

03:27:58.200 --> 03:28:03.480
[Amit Varma]: at the start of the episode, I mentioned that I find many resonances with the way you describe

03:28:03.480 --> 03:28:08.360
[Amit Varma]: the world of sex work changing with the way I've seen other things change. For example,

03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:16.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, one is the fact that the form of so much else was determined by physical restrictions,

03:28:16.760 --> 03:28:22.760
[Amit Varma]: right? So why was a song on radio three minutes because the very first sort of long play record

03:28:22.760 --> 03:28:27.320
[Amit Varma]: that came out right at the start of the year could hold that big a song later on, it expanded

03:28:27.320 --> 03:28:31.840
[Amit Varma]: to holding 40 minutes that became your album length, right? You know, a newspaper is a

03:28:31.840 --> 03:28:36.520
[Amit Varma]: particular way because of particular restrictions. How long should an article be? How many articles

03:28:36.520 --> 03:28:41.160
[Amit Varma]: you want to fit? Everything is a result of a physical restriction, a printed book, it's

03:28:41.160 --> 03:28:44.960
[Amit Varma]: not viable for it to be more than a certain amount of words. So it is a certain amount

03:28:44.960 --> 03:28:51.040
[Amit Varma]: of words. And we had normalized all of these physical restrictions, and they have now kind

03:28:51.040 --> 03:28:55.520
[Amit Varma]: of fallen apart. And that's one way in which I've seen changes in other spaces. The other

03:28:55.520 --> 03:29:01.320
[Amit Varma]: way is the collapse of the mainstream, in the sense that in the media, for example,

03:29:01.320 --> 03:29:06.680
[Amit Varma]: you had big newspapers, and there was a consensus on the truth more or less. And that's where

03:29:06.680 --> 03:29:10.080
[Amit Varma]: you got all the information from and that mainstream has fallen apart and people are

03:29:10.080 --> 03:29:15.000
[Amit Varma]: just getting information plus narratives plus news plus entertainment from all over the

03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:18.200
[Amit Varma]: place in a dispersed way. The same thing has happened to music, the same thing will happen

03:29:18.200 --> 03:29:23.000
[Amit Varma]: to cinema. In the creator economy, you see more and more of this, where more and more

03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:29.080
[Amit Varma]: niches are coming up. And all of this is pretty wonderful. And I was reading your book and

03:29:29.080 --> 03:29:35.560
[Amit Varma]: thinking about the old structures of sex work. For example, typically red light areas would

03:29:35.560 --> 03:29:40.520
[Amit Varma]: come up near ports or near colonies where there were soldiers. And that was sort of

03:29:40.520 --> 03:29:46.000
[Amit Varma]: a physical imperative. And that's where they sort of would be. And where that changed completely

03:29:46.000 --> 03:29:51.680
[Amit Varma]: is and it's changed for a number of reasons. One is that cities have kind of gentrified

03:29:51.680 --> 03:29:57.080
[Amit Varma]: those neighborhoods for a variety of reasons, for zoning reasons, for moral panic reasons,

03:29:57.080 --> 03:30:01.520
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth. And you've described that in your excellent first section where

03:30:01.520 --> 03:30:08.280
[Amit Varma]: you talk about like the four phases in Antwerp, how they gradually shifted. The shift in Oslo,

03:30:08.280 --> 03:30:12.360
[Amit Varma]: which was very fascinating, where street sex shifted to massage parlors. And then there

03:30:12.360 --> 03:30:17.720
[Amit Varma]: were protests against massage parlors because of quote unquote, immoral activities. And

03:30:17.720 --> 03:30:21.440
[Amit Varma]: the sex workers protested back and they called themselves happy hookers to give a different

03:30:21.440 --> 03:30:25.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of impression. And then eventually the massage parlors went and now it's run out

03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:30.880
[Amit Varma]: of flats. And you point out in one place, how your conclusion was that cities are not

03:30:30.880 --> 03:30:38.800
[Amit Varma]: necessarily liberal by default, that liberalism has to be negotiated. And similarly, you know,

03:30:38.800 --> 03:30:43.040
[Amit Varma]: in your great chapter on Kamathipura, you've spoken about how that gradually declined,

03:30:43.040 --> 03:30:47.680
[Amit Varma]: how Kamathipura was a center of so much. There were Mujras, there were these cages where

03:30:47.680 --> 03:30:53.280
[Amit Varma]: people would sort of be displayed as it were, and how that demographic changed from sailors

03:30:53.280 --> 03:30:58.240
[Amit Varma]: to workers. And you've described the decline there. But what has happened in all of these

03:30:58.240 --> 03:31:03.160
[Amit Varma]: cases is something that's happened in these other areas as well, that the old structure

03:31:03.160 --> 03:31:08.280
[Amit Varma]: that sex work is in this particular place, it is a particular kind of person who does

03:31:08.280 --> 03:31:13.920
[Amit Varma]: sex work, it is a particular kind of person who is a client. And all of these have completely

03:31:13.920 --> 03:31:22.240
[Amit Varma]: changed. Now sex work is dispersed. It's not homogenized in any way. Your profile of the

03:31:22.240 --> 03:31:26.040
[Amit Varma]: sex worker has changed completely. You have this great chapter early in the book who sells

03:31:26.040 --> 03:31:31.560
[Amit Varma]: and who buys, which shows how it is no longer straightforward. You know, you talk about

03:31:31.560 --> 03:31:36.200
[Amit Varma]: research from Fortaleza in Brazil, where, you know, the phrase that is used there is

03:31:36.200 --> 03:31:41.400
[Amit Varma]: elegant prostitution on the beach. You talk about the four different types of locations

03:31:41.400 --> 03:31:47.000
[Amit Varma]: for sex work in Spain. It's all really fascinating. You talk about how it's being professionalized.

03:31:47.000 --> 03:31:51.000
[Amit Varma]: Like earlier during this conversation, you spoke about people sometimes ask you for advice.

03:31:51.000 --> 03:31:55.440
[Amit Varma]: And I thought that if you give your book to them, they can just turn to page 2021. And

03:31:55.440 --> 03:31:59.840
[Amit Varma]: just read about what you've written about escorts and the risk management systems that

03:31:59.840 --> 03:32:05.380
[Amit Varma]: they have put in place. It's all laid out there. And this is so incredibly fascinating

03:32:05.380 --> 03:32:11.280
[Amit Varma]: to me that now, you know, almost as the rest of the world, there's a democratization, it's

03:32:11.280 --> 03:32:16.080
[Amit Varma]: dispersed, it's everything has changed so much. And in many ways, like in the rest of

03:32:16.080 --> 03:32:20.960
[Amit Varma]: the world, it's empowered people, it's empowered both people who want to do sex work and people

03:32:20.960 --> 03:32:25.780
[Amit Varma]: who are clients. And sometimes it's very hard to decide which is which also given the kind

03:32:25.780 --> 03:32:31.720
[Amit Varma]: of transactions that go on. So tell me a little bit about this. And were there aspects of

03:32:31.720 --> 03:32:37.200
[Amit Varma]: this which kind of took you by surprise? Because before I read your book, I had never read

03:32:37.200 --> 03:32:41.960
[Amit Varma]: about these changes happening in the context of sex work, though, it kind of should have

03:32:41.960 --> 03:32:47.280
[Amit Varma]: been obvious because what is happening with say something like OnlyFans, you know, OnlyFans

03:32:47.280 --> 03:32:52.320
[Amit Varma]: in a sense did to pornography what I saw happen to people like me in the creator economy,

03:32:52.320 --> 03:32:58.080
[Amit Varma]: where the middleman is cut out and the creators are empowered and you know, so on and so forth.

03:32:58.080 --> 03:33:04.920
[Amit Varma]: It's almost like you're documenting this revolutionary change in this book.

03:33:04.920 --> 03:33:09.960
[Guest]: It's such a rich world. So I really enjoyed reading of transformations in red light areas

03:33:09.960 --> 03:33:14.960
[Guest]: around the world. And they're all saying one thing that globalization has changed the sex

03:33:14.960 --> 03:33:21.200
[Guest]: industry, all with local flavors. And so you know, so in that sense, it's a really rich

03:33:21.200 --> 03:33:26.560
[Guest]: sort of stew of things that that has come about. And you didn't mention, for example,

03:33:26.560 --> 03:33:33.440
[Guest]: the role of regulation, actually, that a place like San Francisco has seen in a period of

03:33:33.440 --> 03:33:39.600
[Guest]: create regulation, we saw the rise of street sex work, because it's easier to run away.

03:33:39.600 --> 03:33:43.760
[Guest]: If you're doing street sex work, rather than being a brothel and definitely be raided and

03:33:43.760 --> 03:33:50.960
[Guest]: you know, taken away, etc. There's also this idea of what is a smart city, what is a world

03:33:50.960 --> 03:33:58.160
[Guest]: city, what is, you know, it is a site of entertainment, it is where sexual entertainment should be

03:33:58.160 --> 03:34:02.840
[Guest]: available. And so then there's a rebranding, basically, prostitution is being rebranded

03:34:02.840 --> 03:34:09.640
[Guest]: as a club good, in a sense, right. So it's integrated with your nightclubs, and your

03:34:09.640 --> 03:34:16.320
[Guest]: other lap dancing and your other kinds of sexual entertainment that any world city is

03:34:16.320 --> 03:34:25.080
[Guest]: expected to offer. So it fits into that kind of imagination of what a world city should

03:34:25.080 --> 03:34:30.720
[Guest]: be. So that's also another change, which is important. Like I said, everything has got

03:34:30.720 --> 03:34:39.320
[Guest]: a very local flavor. So it's not in the case of India, only fans, yes, but it's not again

03:34:39.320 --> 03:34:46.240
[Guest]: an Indian, I mean, the situation is that Indian women are not really online. I mean, the digital

03:34:46.240 --> 03:34:51.680
[Guest]: divide is huge. And those who are online, there are still continued, there are massive

03:34:51.680 --> 03:35:00.320
[Guest]: threats to really publicly doing sex work, right. So there is, it is not as empowering,

03:35:00.320 --> 03:35:04.680
[Guest]: as it would be for might be for women in other countries at this moment, even though they're

03:35:04.680 --> 03:35:10.600
[Guest]: also being threatened with new legislation, like FOSTA, SESTA, there are these new laws

03:35:10.600 --> 03:35:19.680
[Guest]: in the US that make it basically, that criminalize doing sex work online, which has reduced.

03:35:19.680 --> 03:35:24.640
[Guest]: So lots of sex workers have protested against that and said that, look, now we can't screen

03:35:24.640 --> 03:35:31.520
[Guest]: people who are writing to us, etc. And we were, you know, doing, having these online

03:35:31.520 --> 03:35:36.080
[Guest]: advertisements, etc. was important for us, it was a way of increasing our safety. But

03:35:36.080 --> 03:35:42.640
[Guest]: now we can't do that anymore. And you're absolutely right, that those who couldn't access sex

03:35:42.640 --> 03:35:47.600
[Guest]: work earlier, these technological changes have made possible. So the internet has made

03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:52.040
[Guest]: it possible. One of my interviewees said that, you know, earlier, it was only either high

03:35:52.040 --> 03:35:58.320
[Guest]: class men, you know, upper class men, the zamindars, who had access and the or it was

03:35:58.320 --> 03:36:03.120
[Guest]: like laborers. So the middle class men could never really, you know, for many reasons,

03:36:03.120 --> 03:36:06.480
[Guest]: including the moral frameworks they were in, they couldn't access sex work. So this is

03:36:06.480 --> 03:36:11.200
[Guest]: all rooted in this idea that actually, there's a natural entitlement that men actually should

03:36:11.200 --> 03:36:19.800
[Guest]: have to accessing sexual labor. So there is that sort of tinge on these kind of statements.

03:36:19.800 --> 03:36:25.680
[Guest]: But yes, it is true that there is increased access to sex work. The local flavor that

03:36:25.680 --> 03:36:32.080
[Guest]: I talk about means that actually, in India, we have a mix of the old forms and the new

03:36:32.080 --> 03:36:37.960
[Guest]: forms of sex work. So we still have the old traditional forms, we have a red light area,

03:36:37.960 --> 03:36:43.800
[Guest]: which is really reduced from what 100,000 sex workers in the 80s and 90s to 1000 sex

03:36:43.800 --> 03:36:50.640
[Guest]: workers in recent census data. So that's the kind of out flight, that's the kind of flight

03:36:50.640 --> 03:36:56.560
[Guest]: that we have seen away from Kamathipura, from as you said, the different reasons, AIDS raids

03:36:56.560 --> 03:37:03.120
[Guest]: and trades, trades being the fact that Kamathipura is a 24 seven operational area. And so lots

03:37:03.120 --> 03:37:09.840
[Guest]: of small industries are now located there. So, but the changes in that in the physical

03:37:09.840 --> 03:37:16.200
[Guest]: space of Kamathipura are documented through different sources. And the source that I found

03:37:16.200 --> 03:37:22.360
[Guest]: most valuable was the photographs that photographer Sudharak always has taken, you know, and he

03:37:22.360 --> 03:37:26.960
[Guest]: gave me access to his hard drive and I spent a day at his place and he really took me through

03:37:26.960 --> 03:37:33.320
[Guest]: with stories, you know, of the various photographs he's taken. He's been taking photographs since

03:37:33.320 --> 03:37:42.920
[Guest]: I think late 80s of Kamathipura. And above all, I think the images that I saw showed

03:37:42.920 --> 03:37:49.160
[Guest]: to me Kamathipura as a residential locality. It's where people live their lives. It's where

03:37:49.160 --> 03:37:55.080
[Guest]: births happen, marriages happen, deaths happen. And, you know, heartbreaks happen, there's

03:37:55.080 --> 03:38:03.600
[Guest]: violence, there's all kinds of very heartbreaking as well as, you know, moments of celebration.

03:38:03.600 --> 03:38:08.800
[Guest]: I mean, it's a really evocative journey that I experienced looking at those photos and

03:38:08.800 --> 03:38:16.040
[Guest]: they made me really think of what are our sources of data that we actually use to document

03:38:16.040 --> 03:38:22.080
[Guest]: these changes that you're talking about, you know, in a place. And, or, you know, and there

03:38:22.080 --> 03:38:29.520
[Guest]: are actually legislation, important cases. These are the cultural sort of sources that

03:38:29.520 --> 03:38:38.160
[Guest]: one has to look at to understand how the history of sexuality and its regulation in a city.

03:38:38.160 --> 03:38:45.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and you mentioned sort of Kamathipura and there's this excellent passage where you're

03:38:45.520 --> 03:38:51.240
[Amit Varma]: quoting Olwe and I'll read that out where, you know, he's talking about how everything

03:38:51.240 --> 03:38:55.600
[Amit Varma]: is impermanent. And he says, quote, people do their work and go. Population is floating

03:38:55.600 --> 03:38:59.540
[Amit Varma]: and not permanent. Nothing is permanent. You make friends with someone today, she dies

03:38:59.540 --> 03:39:04.360
[Amit Varma]: tomorrow of HIV. Very few have been living there for generations. Those who once lived

03:39:04.360 --> 03:39:08.640
[Amit Varma]: with their mothers or mothers, mothers have been replaced by floating girls from smaller

03:39:08.640 --> 03:39:14.920
[Amit Varma]: towns. So it's a sense of something that is lost in change, just as you know, I had done

03:39:14.920 --> 03:39:20.960
[Amit Varma]: an episode on the wives with Sabadewan. And you've also mentioned that the wives of Lucknow

03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:24.960
[Amit Varma]: how at one point in time, they used to pay more income tax than anybody, you know, there

03:39:24.960 --> 03:39:28.080
[Amit Varma]: was basically the nobility and then there were the wives and then there was everybody

03:39:28.080 --> 03:39:35.040
[Amit Varma]: else. And how over time, they were sort of stigmatized. And that's a whole different

03:39:35.040 --> 03:39:38.400
[Amit Varma]: story. So it's like there's a disappearing world there. And now there's a disappearing

03:39:38.400 --> 03:39:45.440
[Amit Varma]: world here. And now it's a mobile floating gig economy in some ways professionalized,

03:39:45.440 --> 03:39:50.240
[Amit Varma]: and very fluid in the sense that, you know, the binaries don't really apply anymore. It's

03:39:50.240 --> 03:39:54.460
[Amit Varma]: not that you're either a sex worker or you're not, it's just, you know, fluid for so many

03:39:54.460 --> 03:40:00.640
[Amit Varma]: people and all of that. And I kind of found that really fascinating. The other aspect

03:40:00.640 --> 03:40:05.320
[Amit Varma]: of the book, you know, in the section four, you talk about, you've titled your section

03:40:05.320 --> 03:40:11.080
[Amit Varma]: real meets virtual. And you speak about firstly, casual encounter specialists, as you call

03:40:11.080 --> 03:40:16.920
[Amit Varma]: them, and then cruisers, and then you know, men who are servicing female clients, basically.

03:40:16.920 --> 03:40:21.680
[Amit Varma]: And the cruisers bit was also very interesting and cruisers really, where you talk about

03:40:21.680 --> 03:40:28.520
[Amit Varma]: men who are, you know, servicing female clients, and the tropes that emerged there were so

03:40:28.520 --> 03:40:34.000
[Amit Varma]: different from what it would be of the male clients. Like, you know, you quote, one male

03:40:34.000 --> 03:40:38.840
[Amit Varma]: sex worker talking about how the only thing the woman wanted was that he'll sit close

03:40:38.840 --> 03:40:42.200
[Amit Varma]: to her and she'll have a cup of tea with him. And that's all she wanted, which seems just

03:40:42.200 --> 03:40:49.880
[Amit Varma]: this craving for intimacy. And similarly, you know, you talk about how one common thread,

03:40:49.880 --> 03:40:54.640
[Amit Varma]: according to these people, is that these women have been neglected, and they just want company.

03:40:54.640 --> 03:41:01.040
[Amit Varma]: It's not necessarily sex so much. It's just the human touch in a broader sense. And it's

03:41:01.040 --> 03:41:05.320
[Amit Varma]: in this chapter where you also kind of spoke about the Suhagrath fantasy, which is also

03:41:05.320 --> 03:41:10.960
[Amit Varma]: sort of moving in a strange kind of way. And in the next chapter, also where you talk about

03:41:10.960 --> 03:41:15.680
[Amit Varma]: servicing female clients, you point out that when it comes to male escorts, the supply

03:41:15.680 --> 03:41:23.040
[Amit Varma]: is much more than the demand, which is interesting. And this seems to point to inherent differences

03:41:23.040 --> 03:41:28.640
[Amit Varma]: in sex work that while it might well be that more and more women are expressing themselves

03:41:28.640 --> 03:41:33.520
[Amit Varma]: and are kind of giving themselves a permission to, you know, fulfill a need in this way or

03:41:33.520 --> 03:41:39.840
[Amit Varma]: live out a fantasy, it is still very much a case of female sex workers and male clients

03:41:39.840 --> 03:41:49.440
[Amit Varma]: and otherwise, it's kind of outliers. So what's your sort of sense of how all of that is evolving?

03:41:49.440 --> 03:41:55.560
[Guest]: The first thing when you talked about how dispersed everyone has become in Kamathipura

03:41:55.560 --> 03:42:01.160
[Guest]: and you know, the passage you read out about the impermanence of life there is actually

03:42:01.160 --> 03:42:08.960
[Guest]: the root of the fact that there is no organized collective in Kamathipura. And that makes

03:42:08.960 --> 03:42:17.160
[Guest]: it very difficult to organize and have strong movement in Kamathipura. And I wonder if there

03:42:17.160 --> 03:42:23.800
[Guest]: had been a strong collective in Kamathipura, would it have sort of been be such a shadow

03:42:23.800 --> 03:42:29.320
[Guest]: of itself as it is now. I feel there would have been different kind of resistance towards

03:42:29.320 --> 03:42:38.920
[Guest]: its takeover and its decline. Regarding this cruisers, so the cruisers are those who while

03:42:38.920 --> 03:42:43.520
[Guest]: there's, it's really easy to say that these are clients, these are sex workers. In the

03:42:43.520 --> 03:42:47.960
[Guest]: case of cruisers, actually, sometimes they offer sex work services, sometimes they pay

03:42:47.960 --> 03:42:53.360
[Guest]: for sex work services. Sometimes it's not really sex work per se, it's different kinds

03:42:53.360 --> 03:43:00.440
[Guest]: of, you know, sort of intimacies which are being transacted. And so it's very fluid.

03:43:00.440 --> 03:43:05.440
[Guest]: There's no clear cut category that one could put these so which is why they're called sort

03:43:05.440 --> 03:43:12.640
[Guest]: of the cruisers of the internet highways. And their clients and generally the clients,

03:43:12.640 --> 03:43:17.520
[Guest]: the female clients that you've talked about, they are very poignant stories. And I wish

03:43:17.520 --> 03:43:23.480
[Guest]: I had, I mean, these are hard secondhand, right? So this is through the male service

03:43:23.480 --> 03:43:28.080
[Guest]: providers that I heard these stories, I was not able to access the clients themselves.

03:43:28.080 --> 03:43:31.320
[Guest]: And I think that's the thing about research, right? You have to close your research at

03:43:31.320 --> 03:43:35.960
[Guest]: a certain point, and hope that someone will pick up from there and then, you know, take

03:43:35.960 --> 03:43:42.120
[Guest]: it forward and find those clients and the female sex workers and the male sex workers

03:43:42.120 --> 03:43:48.560
[Guest]: and really do more interviews with them really build on that, that opening, go through that

03:43:48.560 --> 03:43:54.920
[Guest]: crack and just widen it, widen it. So there's much more thicker knowledge on it. The thing

03:43:54.920 --> 03:43:59.240
[Guest]: about female clients that I found interesting was that, you know, the service providers

03:43:59.240 --> 03:44:04.400
[Guest]: would keep saying that you have to treat them like a princess. You know, you have to treat

03:44:04.400 --> 03:44:10.760
[Guest]: them, you have to respect them, you have to talk to them, you have to really listen to

03:44:10.760 --> 03:44:15.200
[Guest]: them. So those kinds of things, which are very gendered in a sense, right? Because it's

03:44:15.200 --> 03:44:19.400
[Guest]: like saying that, oh, women don't really they don't really need the sex per se, they want

03:44:19.400 --> 03:44:25.560
[Guest]: the emotional stuff around it. But then, it also seemed to be validated by a lot of the

03:44:25.560 --> 03:44:32.880
[Guest]: stories that they were saying. Whereas the for the men who were, you know, the female

03:44:32.880 --> 03:44:38.600
[Guest]: escort would talk about how you have to make him feel like he's king. So that's its counterpart,

03:44:38.600 --> 03:44:43.120
[Guest]: you have to make the man feel like he's king, he's the best lover in the world. He's like

03:44:43.120 --> 03:44:49.720
[Guest]: amazing. So you just have to feed that ego. And, but I thought it was interesting, you

03:44:49.720 --> 03:44:53.080
[Guest]: know, on one hand, they're saying, you have to make him feel like a king, you have to

03:44:53.080 --> 03:45:01.920
[Guest]: treat her like a princess. So the question of more supply than demand when it comes to

03:45:01.920 --> 03:45:08.320
[Guest]: male escorts. So I came across the male escort service accidentally, actually, because the

03:45:08.320 --> 03:45:16.360
[Guest]: website that I was looking at, they had put up an ad asking to recruit male escorts. So

03:45:16.360 --> 03:45:20.360
[Guest]: I had replied saying that I want to do this interview, etc, etc. So they did, they were

03:45:20.360 --> 03:45:25.480
[Guest]: nice enough to reply. I never found them again, you know, after that, they had sort of, they

03:45:25.480 --> 03:45:32.360
[Guest]: said they don't operate online, because their female clients would not like to go to a website

03:45:32.360 --> 03:45:38.720
[Guest]: and find it. This is absolutely different from what the situation is for male clients

03:45:38.720 --> 03:45:43.080
[Guest]: who want to go to a website who want to click through who want to select and who want to

03:45:43.080 --> 03:45:48.080
[Guest]: for whom it's very legit. It's like a done thing. It's a normalized globalized practice

03:45:48.080 --> 03:45:53.760
[Guest]: to go to an escort services agency and, you know, book a service through them. It's very

03:45:53.760 --> 03:46:01.000
[Guest]: professionalized, it's discrete, etc, etc. The thing for women clients, the male agency

03:46:01.000 --> 03:46:05.640
[Guest]: was like, no, we will not have an internet presence at all. It can only be word of mouth

03:46:05.640 --> 03:46:10.160
[Guest]: because there is a question of safety. There's a question of security. We keep advertising

03:46:10.160 --> 03:46:14.160
[Guest]: for new escorts because we need to have a turnover because we have to think about privacy

03:46:14.160 --> 03:46:19.640
[Guest]: and security of our clients and so on. It was interesting because he said, listen, if

03:46:19.640 --> 03:46:23.080
[Guest]: you I mean, you know, you're coming as a researcher, but if you came as a client, we could give

03:46:23.080 --> 03:46:30.920
[Guest]: you more information. So, I mean, were you tempted? I must say I was not at that time.

03:46:30.920 --> 03:46:36.040
[Guest]: But also that I couldn't find them again. You know, it was a one of those things that

03:46:36.040 --> 03:46:40.320
[Guest]: you know, one is in touch for a while and then they clearly they've changed their numbers

03:46:40.320 --> 03:46:46.520
[Guest]: or their websites or whatever email IDs, all of that. So, then there are the ethics around

03:46:46.520 --> 03:46:51.360
[Guest]: doing research also, right? You can't just skulk around, you can't do sting operation

03:46:51.360 --> 03:46:58.360
[Guest]: kind of methods. You have to state on record that there's an ethics committee, of course.

03:46:58.360 --> 03:47:03.840
[Guest]: And then you have to state on record that you are here, you are doing research. You

03:47:03.840 --> 03:47:10.220
[Guest]: cannot pay for I mean, this is something that is debated often. You don't pay your interviewees

03:47:10.220 --> 03:47:16.320
[Guest]: when you're doing academic research, although you might compensate for travel, etc, etc.

03:47:16.320 --> 03:47:20.600
[Guest]: But here, you know, there was an expectation of payment also in some cases. So, that also

03:47:20.600 --> 03:47:28.400
[Guest]: becomes a bit of a hurdle in actually accessing as many interviewees as you'd like. Yeah,

03:47:28.400 --> 03:47:36.440
[Guest]: the thing with male escort services, I think, is that there's a lot of secrecy around it.

03:47:36.440 --> 03:47:42.160
[Guest]: And so it's difficult to so I've done I've, I did only one agency interview, I wish I'd

03:47:42.160 --> 03:47:47.360
[Guest]: found more. And that's another area where I feel like young researchers or new researchers

03:47:47.360 --> 03:47:56.840
[Guest]: should really look at that site too. I feel that the real edgy thing is women as clients.

03:47:56.840 --> 03:48:02.160
[Guest]: Who is the client? If we are able to really understand women as clients, we I feel that

03:48:02.160 --> 03:48:09.360
[Guest]: we will make some new conceptual headway into really understanding transactional relationships

03:48:09.360 --> 03:48:15.600
[Guest]: and sex. Like what, what is it that motivates women to purchase these services? Is it really

03:48:15.600 --> 03:48:20.200
[Guest]: what you're, you know, the the loneliness aspect, which is very present in all the voices

03:48:20.200 --> 03:48:26.720
[Guest]: that that are there in Intimacy? Or is it desire? Is it fantasy? Is it the need to be

03:48:26.720 --> 03:48:34.640
[Guest]: listened to? Is it just touch? I mean, what is it that that is really their motivation,

03:48:34.640 --> 03:48:40.520
[Guest]: if we heard it from them? So that was, I mean, I would be hungry to read those kinds of stories.

03:48:40.520 --> 03:48:45.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I'd be equally hungry. And I think many of they don't necessarily have

03:48:45.520 --> 03:48:50.080
[Amit Varma]: to emerge from researchers, they can also emerge from fiction writers, novelists, I

03:48:50.080 --> 03:48:53.840
[Amit Varma]: think it's just rich territory. I mean, I was chatting recently with a novelist friend

03:48:53.840 --> 03:48:58.160
[Amit Varma]: of mine and he said, My God, India is the best country in the world to be a novelist

03:48:58.160 --> 03:49:03.200
[Amit Varma]: because you're just surrounded by so many stories and so much complexity and all of

03:49:03.200 --> 03:49:07.440
[Amit Varma]: that. You know, I won't go on about your book anymore, because we could talk for another

03:49:07.440 --> 03:49:11.920
[Amit Varma]: seven hours, I feel a little guilty, I've barely scratched the surface of it. But it's

03:49:11.920 --> 03:49:18.240
[Amit Varma]: such a rich book, and it's got such such vivid descriptions of this new developing ecosystem

03:49:18.240 --> 03:49:23.920
[Amit Varma]: that I think everyone should go out and buy it and read it. And I will certainly read

03:49:23.920 --> 03:49:32.960
[Amit Varma]: it again, at leisure. A couple of sort of final questions. I see two contradictory ways

03:49:32.960 --> 03:49:39.320
[Amit Varma]: in which you can approach and perhaps be changed by writing a book like this. And one approach

03:49:39.320 --> 03:49:44.000
[Amit Varma]: is that all these people that you're meeting or talking to, at some level, the danger that

03:49:44.000 --> 03:49:49.760
[Amit Varma]: a researcher or a nonfiction writer faces is that they become instrumental to that person,

03:49:49.760 --> 03:49:53.920
[Amit Varma]: I have a story to tell, what story can you give me and you become instrumental in that

03:49:53.920 --> 03:49:59.360
[Amit Varma]: sense. And that's obviously something everyone wants to avoid, though it is part of the game,

03:49:59.360 --> 03:50:03.480
[Amit Varma]: they are instrumental, but you don't want to think of them as just that. And the other

03:50:03.480 --> 03:50:08.280
[Amit Varma]: aspect is that I imagine that after writing a book like this, you must be a different

03:50:08.280 --> 03:50:13.520
[Amit Varma]: person and you must be a different person in the opposite direction, where you have

03:50:13.520 --> 03:50:18.320
[Amit Varma]: a little more empathy, where there is a stronger human connection with every single person

03:50:18.320 --> 03:50:24.720
[Amit Varma]: you meet, especially those who otherwise might have been unseen to you or invisible to you,

03:50:24.720 --> 03:50:29.080
[Amit Varma]: just because you've made all these connections, these human connections while writing the

03:50:29.080 --> 03:50:34.040
[Amit Varma]: book. So what's that process been like for you? Like it can't be easy, you know, at the

03:50:34.040 --> 03:50:37.320
[Amit Varma]: end of the day, we have this book, and it's a smooth book, and it's full of great insights

03:50:37.320 --> 03:50:42.640
[Amit Varma]: and great stories. But it can't be easy even at sort of an emotional level to write a book

03:50:42.640 --> 03:50:48.400
[Amit Varma]: like this and negotiate these different kinds of connections that you're making and so on.

03:50:48.400 --> 03:50:57.600
[Guest]: Yeah, I think the question of your participants being instrumental, you know, and sort of

03:50:57.600 --> 03:51:05.760
[Guest]: stepping stones to telling a narrative or a story is always a concern with researchers,

03:51:05.760 --> 03:51:13.440
[Guest]: writers, because research is perceived to be extractive, and in many ways it is. But

03:51:13.440 --> 03:51:24.320
[Guest]: it's also, you know, you can really work around that by having for yourself a framework within

03:51:24.320 --> 03:51:28.840
[Guest]: which you know, you're very transparent and honest with your participants about what it

03:51:28.840 --> 03:51:33.200
[Guest]: is you're seeking, what it is you can offer, because a lot of it, a lot of participants

03:51:33.200 --> 03:51:39.720
[Guest]: will ask you, what can I get out of this, right? And the truth is that actually, I don't

03:51:39.720 --> 03:51:45.960
[Guest]: have anything to offer, except, I mean, you know, reflective space, or, you know, just

03:51:45.960 --> 03:51:50.840
[Guest]: an opportunity to dialogue. And when I was doing the research, I didn't know I was going

03:51:50.840 --> 03:51:56.460
[Guest]: to write a book, right? So the book happened later. One of the questions actually that

03:51:56.460 --> 03:52:02.200
[Guest]: came to me at the launch was that, are you going to share the profits from the book with

03:52:02.200 --> 03:52:09.720
[Guest]: your with the with sex workers who you interviewed? And I understand where that question is coming

03:52:09.720 --> 03:52:13.480
[Guest]: from, because it's asking about authorship, it's asking about this very question that

03:52:13.480 --> 03:52:17.960
[Guest]: it's extractive, you're taking their stories, but what are you giving them in return? And

03:52:17.960 --> 03:52:22.520
[Guest]: the thing is that I have been very upfront and transparent about it. Of course, I'm not

03:52:22.520 --> 03:52:29.360
[Guest]: making any profits. But beyond that, that's not the point. The point is that what is authorship

03:52:29.360 --> 03:52:35.040
[Guest]: and what is co-authorship? You know, when you interview someone, and when you draw on

03:52:35.040 --> 03:52:40.960
[Guest]: their experiences, and your own experiences, and weave several experiences together to

03:52:40.960 --> 03:52:47.880
[Guest]: really think about something and arrive at something, there are different, I feel that

03:52:47.880 --> 03:52:54.120
[Guest]: yes, there are research participants who have contributed to the process. There are other

03:52:54.120 --> 03:52:58.600
[Guest]: situations where there is co-authorship, genuine co-authorship, you know, and one does not

03:52:58.600 --> 03:53:04.200
[Guest]: put one's name to it. For example, one has written so many things about violence, etc,

03:53:04.200 --> 03:53:13.080
[Guest]: etc. But that's the work of many, many minds, you know, which come together to create a

03:53:13.080 --> 03:53:20.920
[Guest]: kind of to create work, to create new knowledge. And so there is that distinction that a writer

03:53:20.920 --> 03:53:28.360
[Guest]: or a researcher is constantly doing, you know, feminist participatory process demands that

03:53:28.360 --> 03:53:35.600
[Guest]: you do that. So I think that is there. It's also true that this, like what, like we were

03:53:35.600 --> 03:53:40.680
[Guest]: saying, you know, do you pay your research participants? Do you not? Why would you not

03:53:40.680 --> 03:53:45.400
[Guest]: pay for someone's time? But then are they going to say what you they think you want

03:53:45.400 --> 03:53:50.680
[Guest]: to hear? What should be the ideal relationship between a researcher and a researchee? Is

03:53:50.680 --> 03:53:56.440
[Guest]: there anything beyond just equality and opening yourself up and being transparent, being honest?

03:53:56.440 --> 03:54:01.520
[Guest]: That is there more that a researcher can do? And I think the research community does think

03:54:01.520 --> 03:54:08.920
[Guest]: about this more and more. But there's the nature of the beast, you know, in a sense.

03:54:08.920 --> 03:54:17.840
[Guest]: So that would be my realization over the last two books, I would say. Am I a different person?

03:54:17.840 --> 03:54:26.400
[Guest]: Certainly. I am a different person after Mannequin, I would say more so, perhaps because it's

03:54:26.400 --> 03:54:31.960
[Guest]: it was it happened at a very impressionable time in life for me. And, you know, it just

03:54:31.960 --> 03:54:41.000
[Guest]: became much more empathetic and able to really see nuance and not feel the need to stick

03:54:41.000 --> 03:54:48.920
[Guest]: to some part of a debate. Really, it liberated me from a lot of archaic feminist thinking

03:54:48.920 --> 03:54:56.880
[Guest]: and enabled me to really have positions of my own, which are very, very based on honest

03:54:56.880 --> 03:55:06.600
[Guest]: interaction with people who I had spoken to. In this particular intimate city, I was changed

03:55:06.600 --> 03:55:12.960
[Guest]: in the sense that I think I appreciated the city much more. I discovered it was a way

03:55:12.960 --> 03:55:21.480
[Guest]: to discover Mumbai. It was a way to discover really an interior life of people and realize

03:55:21.480 --> 03:55:27.480
[Guest]: that there are interior lives that we don't know about. We don't often we don't talk about

03:55:27.480 --> 03:55:34.440
[Guest]: we don't read about. And it just makes me feel really excited for all the research that

03:55:34.440 --> 03:55:40.760
[Guest]: I have yet to do in my life. You know, it just gives you a new understanding that there's

03:55:40.760 --> 03:55:44.840
[Guest]: so much more to learn and know and to ask.

03:55:44.840 --> 03:55:50.560
[Amit Varma]: Wow. Can't wait to, you know, read the research that you go on to do and the questions you

03:55:50.560 --> 03:55:55.720
[Amit Varma]: go on to ask, but also please write that novella about that sack of fur as you eloquently described

03:55:55.720 --> 03:56:02.960
[Amit Varma]: it. Finally, you know, to end, give us, me and my listeners, give us some recommendations

03:56:02.960 --> 03:56:09.120
[Amit Varma]: in terms of books you love, films you love, music you love, you know, Desert Island books

03:56:09.120 --> 03:56:13.960
[Amit Varma]: and films and music for you. I mean, I feel like I've done a disservice to my listeners

03:56:13.960 --> 03:56:18.600
[Amit Varma]: by not going a little deeper into these aspects of you like you're a Bharatnatyam dancer,

03:56:18.600 --> 03:56:24.000
[Amit Varma]: for example, while doing this book, you tried to learn the Lavani and all of that. So this,

03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:28.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, but we'll do a 10 hour episode next time, perhaps and cover those areas. But for

03:56:28.320 --> 03:56:33.440
[Amit Varma]: now, you know, what are the books and films and music that mean a lot to you?

03:56:33.440 --> 03:56:44.640
[Guest]: Amit, I am a conventional consumer of books and films. I love rom-coms. And yeah, I love

03:56:44.640 --> 03:56:50.000
[Guest]: rom-coms. I wish they would make rom-coms like they used to, like a good Notting Hill.

03:56:50.000 --> 03:56:51.800
[Amit Varma]: I'm just waiting for someone to...

03:56:51.800 --> 03:56:55.320
[Amit Varma]: Or like Pretty Woman, which would help you with your book also.

03:56:55.320 --> 03:57:00.480
[Guest]: Pretty Woman, yes. But I mean, you know, there were many, you know, like...

03:57:00.480 --> 03:57:01.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm kidding.

03:57:01.480 --> 03:57:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Problematic things in Pretty Woman too, but I love Pretty Woman also. So I'm very conventional

03:57:06.040 --> 03:57:10.680
[Guest]: in that sense. In terms of books, you know, something I read recently was Arunabha Sinha's

03:57:10.680 --> 03:57:18.480
[Guest]: translated version of Mandadevi's autobiography, An Educated Woman in Prostitution, which I

03:57:18.480 --> 03:57:26.800
[Guest]: loved, which was a translation of a memoir by a Bengali educated woman in prostitution

03:57:26.800 --> 03:57:32.520
[Guest]: as you would have guessed from the title. But it really showed me how, you know, women

03:57:32.520 --> 03:57:38.520
[Guest]: in prostitution have been the only ones who have been financially, a group of women who

03:57:38.520 --> 03:57:43.760
[Guest]: have been financially independent since forever. And like, you know, you said that you talked

03:57:43.760 --> 03:57:47.800
[Guest]: about how they were the highest taxpayers because they were the only group of women

03:57:47.800 --> 03:57:52.520
[Guest]: who were actually financially independent. And that book really revealed to me that things

03:57:52.520 --> 03:57:57.760
[Guest]: have not changed so much between 18th century Bengal and now because life outside either

03:57:57.760 --> 03:58:01.600
[Guest]: marriage or prostitution is impossible for women. It's very challenging. I mean, it's

03:58:01.600 --> 03:58:05.280
[Guest]: possible, but it really, the constraints are huge.

03:58:05.280 --> 03:58:10.120
[Amit Varma]: Such an incredible quote, life outside marriage and prostitution is impossible for women.

03:58:10.120 --> 03:58:11.800
[Guest]: Sorry, carry on.

03:58:11.800 --> 03:58:17.560
[Guest]: I also want to recommend Factory Girls by Leslie T. Chang, which is an oldish book,

03:58:17.560 --> 03:58:23.800
[Guest]: but it really showed me how young women work in terrible conditions in the factories in

03:58:23.800 --> 03:58:28.920
[Guest]: China, but they love every moment of it because it's giving them freedom in different kinds

03:58:28.920 --> 03:58:34.920
[Guest]: of ways. In terms of films, I'm trying to think of.

03:58:34.920 --> 03:58:41.600
[Amit Varma]: You're a regular mommy buff every year. So you can't pretend you don't watch films.

03:58:41.600 --> 03:58:49.280
[Guest]: That's true. I really miss mommy. I needed to come back before I. Someone make a rom

03:58:49.280 --> 03:58:55.600
[Guest]: com quick that I can recommend because I can't think of any amazing films I've seen recently.

03:58:55.600 --> 03:59:04.160
[Guest]: Gangubai Kathiyawadi, which I watched. So I know you're not a fan of Sanjay Leela Bhansali,

03:59:04.160 --> 03:59:10.480
[Guest]: but have you seen Gangubai? I highly recommend you watch Gangubai Kathiyawadi for its emotional

03:59:10.480 --> 03:59:18.160
[Guest]: trope. I love emotional films. And that really is the good old tradition of Bollywood. I

03:59:18.160 --> 03:59:23.280
[Guest]: mean, that would be a video cassette that would have made the rounds twice over in my

03:59:23.280 --> 03:59:29.880
[Guest]: building in Kuwait. I'm sure it was a really. You've been so generous. You've been so generous

03:59:29.880 --> 03:59:34.520
[Amit Varma]: today with your time that I feel I owe it to you then to also spend however long that

03:59:34.520 --> 03:59:38.520
[Amit Varma]: film is in watching it. So I will watch it once for you and I will not mention to you

03:59:38.520 --> 03:59:44.320
[Amit Varma]: what I feel about it, but unless I like it in the unlikely event. I think you'll love

03:59:44.320 --> 03:59:52.840
[Guest]: it. Oh, God. She said with a mischievous glint in her eyes. Oh, and one more film that that

03:59:52.840 --> 04:00:00.200
[Guest]: I think you should watch is it's an old film, a French film called L.E.L.L.E.S., which has

04:00:00.200 --> 04:00:07.480
[Guest]: Juliette Binoche, an actress I love and admire greatly. And it's about she's a journalist

04:00:07.480 --> 04:00:14.360
[Guest]: and she goes out to investigate this story about, you know, students who are doing escorting

04:00:14.360 --> 04:00:19.400
[Guest]: or providing services on the side and the realization and the changes that it brings

04:00:19.400 --> 04:00:24.920
[Guest]: to her life and her relationships. And it's it's quite fantastic. You should watch that.

04:00:24.920 --> 04:00:29.480
[Amit Varma]: I can't wait to watch it. And I have to tell you that Juliette Binoche was my first teenage

04:00:29.480 --> 04:00:34.500
[Amit Varma]: crush in a sense of a major foreign actress when I saw her in The Unbearable Lightness

04:00:34.500 --> 04:00:39.080
[Amit Varma]: of Being. Such a great film directed by Philip Kaufman. And it was co-written by Jean-Claude

04:00:39.080 --> 04:00:43.560
[Amit Varma]: Carrière, who also co-wrote three of my favorite films of all time. I don't know if you've

04:00:43.560 --> 04:00:49.880
[Amit Varma]: seen them made by Louis Buñuel. When he was in his 70s, between 1970 and 1980, he made

04:00:49.880 --> 04:00:55.760
[Amit Varma]: these three films before he died. The Phantom of Liberty, Discrete Charm of the Bourgeoisie

04:00:55.760 --> 04:01:02.720
[Amit Varma]: and one more whose name I forget now because I'm also growing old, but just masterpieces.

04:01:02.720 --> 04:01:07.280
[Guest]: Have you seen The Discrete Charm of the Savarnas? No, what is that? Oh, it's an amazing film.

04:01:07.280 --> 04:01:12.400
[Guest]: You have to see it. I don't remember who made it, but it's modeled on The Discrete Charm

04:01:12.400 --> 04:01:19.040
[Guest]: of the Bourgeoisie. And it's about, you know, what Savarnas think Dalits should look like.

04:01:19.040 --> 04:01:24.800
[Guest]: Wow. It's an amazing film. It's a short film. You should see that as well. I also love Juliette

04:01:24.800 --> 04:01:29.360
[Guest]: Binoche. I've had a crush on her forever. That makes two of us. And so Juliette Binoche,

04:01:29.360 --> 04:01:32.720
[Amit Varma]: if you're listening to this, and I know many people listen to my podcast, but I'm not sure

04:01:32.720 --> 04:01:38.480
[Amit Varma]: it goes quite that far. So Manjima, thank you so much. You've been so generous with
