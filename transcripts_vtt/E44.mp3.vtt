00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: IVM

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:50.680
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen. I live in Mumbai and I feel a mix of sympathy and

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.080
[Amit Varma]: schadenfreude from my friends in Delhi. When they're not complaining about the government,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.800
[Amit Varma]: they complain about the smog. Well, I wanted to dig a little deeper into the causes of

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.280
[Amit Varma]: this Delhi smog and what insights a little economic thinking could give me on it. So

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.640
[Amit Varma]: I've invited my friend and a frequent guest on the show, Vivek Kaul. Vivek has written

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.360
[Amit Varma]: many books and he's a columnist for Equity Master for whom he wrote a newsletter with

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.480
[Amit Varma]: the title, The Economic Cause of the Delhi Smog. That's exactly what I want to get to

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.920
[Amit Varma]: the heart of today. Vivek, welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.600
[Amit Varma]: Thanks Amit for having me over.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.920
[Amit Varma]: So tell me more about the root causes of Delhi's smog.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.280
[Guest]: Okay. So that could take an entire show. So that's the idea. Okay. So you see, basically,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.920
[Guest]: you know, the rice that is grown in Punjab is mechanically harvested. And what that does

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.760
[Guest]: is the harvesters cut and clean the rice from the paddy and leave behind the straws on the

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:57.240
[Guest]: field. Now these straws are six to eight inches in height. Okay. You know, when the rice harvesting

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.560
[Guest]: season ends, the wheat season is about to start and the gap is two to three weeks. So

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.840
[Guest]: the farmers who have been growing rice now need to grow wheat and the time period available

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.560
[Guest]: is not much. So they need to get rid of the straw very, very quickly. Okay. Obviously,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.560
[Guest]: you know, they could hire laborers and, you know, get them to cut the straw, but that

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.320
[Guest]: would involve spending money. There are machines that are available, you know, which sort of

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.840
[Guest]: take care of these straw and also sort of plant the seeds to grow wheat. But that also

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.680
[Guest]: involves, you know, spending a lot of money. So the farmers take the easiest way out, which

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.440
[Guest]: is they just light a match and they burn the straw. And this straw is also, in case my

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.120
[Amit Varma]: listeners are confused, this straw is also referred to as stubble. It is referred to

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.080
[Amit Varma]: as stubble as well. Yes. So essentially the core cause of Delhi's pollution is farmers

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.000
[Amit Varma]: in Punjab who are burning the stubble and not so much the vehicular traffic of Delhi

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.640
[Amit Varma]: per se. And you know, the last time, for example, Arvind Kejriwal did his whole odd even thing,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.680
[Amit Varma]: it had negligible impact on the air of Delhi and I believe he's planning to do it again.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.640
[Guest]: But that's just optics. The root cause, the problem that you have to solve is the stubble.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.120
[Guest]: And you know, what happens is, now obviously, you know, the listeners might want to know

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:30.440
[Guest]: as to why nothing happens when wheat is harvested. Now, the stubble or the straw that wheat leaves

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.800
[Guest]: behind is low on silica content. Or rather the stubble or the straw that rice leaves

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.680
[Guest]: behind is high on silica content. And hence that cannot be cut and fed to animals, okay,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.000
[Guest]: which the wheat straw can be. So hence the farmers really don't have any option other

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.880
[Guest]: than sort of burning it. I mean, there are, you know, I mean, I've read news reports where,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.280
[Guest]: you know, this straw can be used as an input into paperboards, etc. But then, you know,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.920
[Guest]: paperboards are made all through the year. And this straw is available only for a very

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.360
[Guest]: limited period. So that doesn't leave the farmer with many options.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.160
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting insight I got from reading your newsletter for Equity Master on the subject

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.840
[Amit Varma]: was that for Punjab to grow rice is actually not a natural thing. It's an unnatural set

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.920
[Amit Varma]: of circumstances that has made of Punjab one of the leaders in growing rice.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.080
[Guest]: Yes. So Punjab is basically a semi-arid region. And you know, to grow rice, you need a lot

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.880
[Guest]: of water. So Punjab in the first place should not be growing rice. But Punjab grows a lot

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.640
[Guest]: of rice. It's the third largest grower of rice in India after West Bengal and Uttar

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:57.840
[Guest]: Pradesh. In 2015-16, it produced around 11.85 million tons of rice. Now what happens is

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.720
[Guest]: that the government of India procures rice and wheat primarily from the farmers using

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.040
[Guest]: institutions like the Food Corporation of India in order to distribute that rice and

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.360
[Guest]: wheat through the public distribution system, which, you know, is essentially a chain of

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.000
[Guest]: more than 5 lakh ration shops all throughout the country.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.360
[Guest]: Now, the funny bit is that nearly one-fourth of the rice that the government of India procures

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:34.040
[Guest]: all through the country is procured in Punjab. So in 2015-16, around 9.35 million tons of

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.440
[Guest]: the 11.85 million tons which was produced was procured by the government. So the Punjab

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.360
[Guest]: farmer has a ready sort of customer in the government of India. He doesn't have to sort

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.320
[Amit Varma]: of go looking around to sell the rice that he produces.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.000
[Amit Varma]: So he doesn't have to worry about market dynamics. He knows that the rice will be sold. He knows

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.520
[Guest]: at what price it will be sold.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.480
[Guest]: And the funny thing is that the, you know, Punjab as a state is a roti-eating state.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.240
[Guest]: So almost all the rice that they produce is sold. Very little gets consumed within the

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.360
[Guest]: state. What is not bought by the government is bought by the private traders.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.280
[Amit Varma]: So, ghar ki roti, rice parabar.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:19.520
[Guest]: Ghar ki roti, rice parabar. The other thing that is, you know, that sort of essentially

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.880
[Guest]: ensures that the Punjab farmer grows rice is the fact that electricity is free in Punjab.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.680
[Guest]: And this ensures that the farmers can use, you know, can pump a lot of water which is

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.040
[Guest]: needed to produce rice.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.460
[Guest]: So you know, just to give you a sense of comparison, you know, when Punjab is the most productive

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:49.460
[Guest]: state in India when it comes to rice. It produces close to 39.74 quintals of rice per hectare.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.960
[Guest]: Okay. But this calculation does not take the amount of water that it uses to produce that

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.120
[Guest]: rice.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.840
[Guest]: So in a state like West Bengal, you know, you require around 2, 1, 6, 9 litres of water

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.400
[Guest]: to produce 1 kg of rice.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.020
[Guest]: That's a lot of water.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.320
[Guest]: But in a state like Punjab, you require almost double the amount. It's around 4,100 litres

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.680
[Guest]: and a little more than that.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:21.800
[Guest]: So what that tells you is that there are two wrong incentives essentially, which are encouraging

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.520
[Guest]: the Punjabi farmer to produce rice.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.840
[Guest]: One is the fact that there is a ready customer in the government available, you know, buys

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.520
[Guest]: rice and the fact that an unlimited amount of water can be pumped because electricity

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.520
[Guest]: is free.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.280
[Guest]: Okay. So that ensures that Punjab produces a lot of rice. And once Punjab produces a

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:49.080
[Guest]: lot of rice, obviously, you know, it is left with a lot of stubble, which the farmers burn

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.200
[Guest]: so that they can quickly move towards producing wheat.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.240
[Guest]: Over the years, you know, the government has done a few things here and there and there

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:06.200
[Guest]: is a fine which sort of, you know, the farmers who burn the stubble need to pay.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:16.560
[Guest]: And this fine is essentially, you know, it starts at around rupees 2,500 on burning these

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.080
[Guest]: after harvest rice straw on a land of up to two acres.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.600
[Guest]: Then there is 5,000 for land measuring two to five acres, 7,000 fine for a land greater

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.800
[Guest]: than five acres and less than 10 acres.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.720
[Guest]: And beyond that, there's a fine of 15,000 rupees.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.800
[Guest]: So you know, the fine is so low that it essentially makes sense for the farmer to burn the stubble

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.500
[Guest]: rather than hire labor and get the labor to cut that stubble or straw.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.960
[Guest]: So the fine does not work.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.560
[Guest]: And even if the fine was higher, it would just be a rent seeking outlet, you just give

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.560
[Guest]: a bribe to the inspector.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.920
[Guest]: Yes. And more than that, you know, I mean, as I keep saying, the capacity of governments

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.840
[Guest]: in India to do anything is very, very limited.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.520
[Guest]: So, you know, there is no data from satellite imaging, which shows satellite data shows

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:11.680
[Guest]: that there were 40,510 fire incidents in Punjab alone between September 27 and November 9.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.720
[Guest]: Now, you know, 40,000 is a huge number.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.760
[Guest]: You know, how many of those farmers, you know, could the government go and fine?

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.320
[Guest]: It just doesn't make.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.160
[Guest]: So fines don't make any sense.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:30.480
[Guest]: I mean, they do not dissuade the farmers from burning the straw.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:37.280
[Guest]: In fact, you know, one of the one of the news reports I read, and it had quoted a farmer

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.040
[Guest]: and who summarized, you know, the situation very well.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.800
[Guest]: It's, you know, he basically said that, you know, you just need to light one matchstick.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.960
[Guest]: So you're essentially competing against that.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.880
[Guest]: I mean, it's as convenient as just lighting a matchstick.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.000
[Amit Varma]: So in terms of both actual cost and opportunity cost, you can't beat that.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.440
[Amit Varma]: That's the simplest way for them to.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.960
[Amit Varma]: Okay, so now, the political economy of this is interesting, that these are we know the

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.440
[Amit Varma]: two things that the government does wrong, that a there are the MSPs for rice and it

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.320
[Amit Varma]: guarantees that it will procure so much so the procurement system is messed up and doesn't

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.640
[Amit Varma]: go is not aligned with market signals.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.560
[Amit Varma]: And two, there's a free electricity.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is really the Delhi smog is actually an unseen effect of free power to farmers

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:28.520
[Amit Varma]: in Punjab, to a large extent, which is not an obvious connection now, because farmers

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.120
[Amit Varma]: are both an important vote bank and a wealthy vote bank.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, farmers in Punjab, I mean, Kali Dal is a party of large farmers, basically

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.080
[Amit Varma]: of large farmers, and they can afford to buy other parties per se, if the need so requires.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.200
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, politically, the political will to actually do something about this, no matter

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.680
[Amit Varma]: what you might say, becomes sort of problematic.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.160
[Amit Varma]: And much as I am not a fan of KG wallet, then makes me wonder that what is a poor guy to

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.160
[Amit Varma]: do?

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.000
[Amit Varma]: He's got a problem in Delhi, which is caused by something that the farmers of Punjab are

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
[Amit Varma]: doing.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.640
[Amit Varma]: And the farmers of Punjab don't give a shit.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.600
[Amit Varma]: And they've effectively bought, I mean, the Punjab government has to cater to their wishes.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.520
[Guest]: So what is the way out?

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:17.320
[Guest]: I mean, the way out is essentially, I mean, and again, this is a solution, which may not

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:23.800
[Guest]: have political will, but I think this is, you know, one of the solutions going around.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:30.280
[Guest]: So you have to essentially disincentivize the farmers in Punjab from growing as much

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.800
[Guest]: rice as they do.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.600
[Guest]: Now, that can happen.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.600
[Guest]: How can that happen?

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:40.120
[Guest]: It can happen by essentially ensuring that the Food Corporation of India sets up more

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.320
[Guest]: procurement centers in states where it's not buying a lot of rice.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.920
[Guest]: Now take the example of a state like West Bengal.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:53.400
[Guest]: Now West Bengal produces around 15.7, rather it produced in 2015-16 around 15.75 million

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.400
[Guest]: tons of rice.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.680
[Guest]: Of that only around 10% got procured.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.480
[Guest]: Now even though, you know, West Bengal is a rice eating state.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.280
[Guest]: Now so what that does is given that the government procures very little, a lot of that rice ends

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.080
[Guest]: up being sold at a price which is lower than the MSP.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.640
[Guest]: Now this is also true about states like Bihar and Assam.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.520
[Guest]: So obviously, you know, these are states, you know, Bihar, West Bengal, you know, they're

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.760
[Guest]: in the Gangetic plain.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.740
[Guest]: So there is a lot of water going around to grow rice.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:30.960
[Guest]: So more procurement needs to happen in these states and procurement needs to move out from

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.400
[Guest]: a state like Punjab.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400
[Guest]: Number one.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.760
[Guest]: The second thing is, you obviously, you know, once they don't grow rice, they need to grow

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.000
[Guest]: something else.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.760
[Guest]: So one of the options that, you know, a gentleman called Ajayveer Jakhar, who is, you know,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:55.480
[Guest]: sort of, you can call him an agriculture economist, made was that the farmers in Punjab should

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.680
[Guest]: be encouraged to grow maize.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.440
[Guest]: Now which would happen only once the government sort of starts procuring maize.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.520
[Guest]: Now the government of India right now only procures rice and wheat.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.000
[Guest]: And given the fact that our private, you know, the private markets in agriculture are so

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.880
[Guest]: screwed up that expecting a solution from there is, you know, is very difficult.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:23.220
[Guest]: So the procurement needs to move out from Punjab and it needs to go to other states.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:29.920
[Guest]: And once, you know, this, the procurement is spread around, even if there is, you know,

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:37.160
[Guest]: the stubble is burnt, it won't cause so much problem because the production of rice would

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.120
[Guest]: sort of, and procurement of rice would be spread over a larger area.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:49.080
[Guest]: The second part is, you know, in states like Bihar and West Bengal, labor is still cheaper,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.600
[Guest]: you know, vis-a-vis a state like Punjab, which is a fairly rich state.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:58.320
[Guest]: So there, you know, you can still hire people to sort of cut the stubble and get rid of

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.240
[Guest]: it.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.560
[Guest]: So this needs to happen.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.720
[Guest]: Now the question obviously is whether this will happen or not.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:11.560
[Guest]: And the answer is no, because, you know, the rich farmers of Punjab have been used to the

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.840
[Guest]: government buying their rice over the years.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.240
[Guest]: And this is essentially again, one of the things that has happened because of the Green

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.800
[Guest]: Revolution in the state.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:26.760
[Guest]: You know, when initially farmers started, you know, newer varieties of wheat were sort

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:33.280
[Guest]: of imported from Mexico and the farmers were essentially encouraged to grow that wheat.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:38.080
[Guest]: The government, in order to support those farmers, also started to buy that wheat.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.680
[Guest]: And over a period of time, you know, it started to buy rice as well.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:48.240
[Guest]: So this is a system which has been in place for close to, you know, four and a half to

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:53.640
[Guest]: five decades, and it will not be very easy to unravel it.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.480
[Amit Varma]: My slightly skeptical take on the solutions you mentioned, I mean, I know they're not

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.840
[Amit Varma]: your solutions, or the solutions that are generally out there.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.240
[Amit Varma]: But my skeptical take on those two solutions were that they're both coming from a sort

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.680
[Amit Varma]: of a central planning mindset.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, one being that you do more procurement in the Gangetic states like Bengal and so

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.720
[Amit Varma]: on.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.920
[Amit Varma]: And the other being that you also start procuring maize or whatever and try to change the incentives

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.920
[Amit Varma]: that way.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.360
[Amit Varma]: So while I think that the whole central planning mindset rather is fundamentally flawed and

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.640
[Guest]: has led to this problem in the first place, which will bring me to another question.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.640
[Guest]: I'll just elaborate on this.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.640
[Guest]: Yes, if you just let me.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.960
[Guest]: So I mean, I'm not a supporter of central planning in any way.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:37.160
[Guest]: But you know, what happens Amit, when a system is in place, you cannot just automatically,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.800
[Guest]: you know, let it go and move towards another system.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.800
[Guest]: That causes an even bigger, look at what demonetization did.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it essentially demonetization came right out of the central planning mindset.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.480
[Amit Varma]: And that's why it was such a massive disaster.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.480
[Guest]: Yes.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.240
[Guest]: But then, you know, it tried to attack a system which is in place, the black money system,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:01.840
[Guest]: you had, you know, these things of unravelling that system overnight.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:08.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but the idea was an act of mass coercion that led to, it was an act of mass coercion

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.120
[Amit Varma]: and that led to less freedom in that short term that had happened.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.760
[Amit Varma]: Because dismantling agricultural markets slowly would actually remove coercion and would lead

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.760
[Amit Varma]: to more freedom.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.440
[Amit Varma]: My point is not that you do it over time.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.920
[Amit Varma]: My whole point is and my point also has a dilemma.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.000
[Amit Varma]: It's not a panacea and I'll get to that because that's the next question I'm going to ask

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
[Amit Varma]: you.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.800
[Amit Varma]: But I think what happens is that not only are agricultural markets controlled strongly

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.180
[Amit Varma]: by government and thus perverting the incentives for the farmers and leading to situations

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:44.680
[Amit Varma]: like this, but because of that private markets also can't operate and information that spreads

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:49.960
[Amit Varma]: everywhere through market signals like prices don't otherwise get going.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:55.080
[Amit Varma]: But leave that aside, even assume, let's for a moment have a thought experiment where all

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.880
[Amit Varma]: of this doesn't exist.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.600
[Amit Varma]: And we are a libertarian utopia and the market works perfectly.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.480
[Amit Varma]: And let's assume that even in that situation, Punjab happens not to be semi-arid as it actually

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.520
[Amit Varma]: is, but it has enough water and rice is something natural for it to grow.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.160
[Amit Varma]: And there's enough demand for it to grow all of it.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.280
[Amit Varma]: So assume that despite those perverted, if those incentives don't exist, but the conditions

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.720
[Amit Varma]: are different, they're still growing that much rice and they're still burning the struggle

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.240
[Amit Varma]: and the externalities of that, that is the harsh side effects of that are being felt

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.800
[Amit Varma]: by the people of Delhi.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.760
[Amit Varma]: What kind of solutions would then exist in that state of being?

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:38.080
[Guest]: I mean, then you'll have to essentially penalize them for damaging the environment.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.080
[Amit Varma]: And this incentivize them.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.720
[Amit Varma]: So something like the famous carbon tax that people talk about.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:48.640
[Guest]: And then you basically have to ensure that the price of rice that is produced in Punjab

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:54.320
[Guest]: essentially takes the cost of destroying the environment into account as well.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.280
[Guest]: Once that is done, automatically that rice will become more expensive.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.000
[Guest]: And in comparison to rice being produced in a state like West Bengal.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.320
[Amit Varma]: And the demand will go down and they'll have to shift to something else.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:10.280
[Amit Varma]: So the optimal solution is that you a, figure out a penalty on burning struggle and find

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.880
[Amit Varma]: a way to, with given state capacity, find a way to enforce that so that it actually

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.340
[Amit Varma]: becomes unprofitable for the farmers to grow rice because their costs go up and they have

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.340
[Guest]: to shift to wheat.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.920
[Guest]: But then that will never happen essentially because political parties have elections to

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.920
[Amit Varma]: win.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.920
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.920
[Amit Varma]: Which holds true for any solution.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it seems that poor KGV will keep tweeting about this, but there's nothing he can do.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.200
[Amit Varma]: At least, you know, not nothing in the near future.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.160
