00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.540
[Amit Varma]: The philosopher Thomas Nagel once wrote an essay called What is it like to be a bat?

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.960
[Amit Varma]: One of the arguments in that essay was that even if a human could try and imagine what

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.680
[Amit Varma]: it was like to be a bat by taking the bat's point of view, it is impossible to know what

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.600
[Amit Varma]: it is like for a bat to be a bat.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.620
[Amit Varma]: If you wrote an essay called What is it like to be a woman, men would be in a similar situation.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.600
[Amit Varma]: Our powers of empathy and imagination can only get us so far.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.360
[Amit Varma]: We are mostly blind to the many ways in which women have to adapt to live in a world designed

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.200
[Amit Varma]: by men, for men.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.360
[Amit Varma]: And so much have we normalized this, that even many women take it for granted.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.840
[Amit Varma]: What is it like to be a woman in a world where hotel rooms don't have latches on the inside,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.880
[Amit Varma]: where offices don't have enough women's toilets, where workplaces don't account for periods

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.200
[Amit Varma]: or pregnancies, where the men are all raja betas and the women are grocery lists trapped

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.920
[Amit Varma]: in human bodies, as my guest today wrote, where you aren't taken seriously, you are

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.440
[Amit Varma]: interrupted all the time.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.400
[Amit Varma]: And Fufaji is a bigot.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.240
[Amit Varma]: All these extra layers of life that men just don't have to deal with, they need to be documented.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.360
[Amit Varma]: Someone needs to write about what it's like to be womaning in India.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.240
[Amit Varma]: Somebody is.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.760
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.760
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.120
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.680
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.040
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Mahima Vashisht, a former civil servant who runs a phenomenal newsletter,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.040
[Amit Varma]: Womaning in India.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.880
[Amit Varma]: Mahima did my writing course a couple of years ago, and at the end of the course asked for

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.240
[Amit Varma]: my advice on writing.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.080
[Amit Varma]: We did a zoom call and she told me about an idea she had for a book to write about those

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.680
[Amit Varma]: aspects of women's lives that men had no clue about.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.200
[Amit Varma]: I suggested that the best way to get the ball rolling was not to write a book straight away,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.200
[Amit Varma]: for that can be a daunting project, but to start a weekly newsletter.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.440
[Amit Varma]: So she did, and Womaning in India has now gathered a cult following.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.320
[Amit Varma]: She's built a tremendous body of work documenting what women go through in the workplace, in

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.800
[Amit Varma]: public spaces, in their homes and in their own heads.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.560
[Amit Varma]: She's spoken to countless women across this country, gathered their stories and illuminated

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.880
[Amit Varma]: a world that many men, even well-meaning men, would have been clueless about.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.120
[Amit Varma]: So I figured I'd get her on the show to talk about her life, her work and Womaning in India.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.040
[Amit Varma]: But first, let's go to a unique kind of commercial break, Capital Gyaan by Deepak Shannoy.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.360
[Amit Varma]: This is like a show within a commercial from the kind sponsors of this episode, Capital

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.360
[Amit Varma]: Mind.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:51.200
[Unknown]: When my father passed away, he left my mother's shares of over 30 different companies.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.640
[Unknown]: When I look at them now, 23 of these companies are dead or defunct.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.240
[Unknown]: Only 7 have given us a positive return.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.640
[Unknown]: But these 7 have returned 40 times in the entire investment.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.120
[Unknown]: That's a yearly return of 20% plus over 20 years from just one fourth of the stocks.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.680
[Unknown]: Peter Lynch has said that booking profits on your winners to add to your losers is like

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.840
[Unknown]: pulling out the flowers and watering the weeds.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.120
[Unknown]: Letting your winners run and not regretting your losers is one of the hallmarks of great

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.440
[Unknown]: investment returns.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.920
[Unknown]: I'm Deepak Shannoy, CEO at Capital Mind.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.120
[Unknown]: In our portfolio management service, we use both quantitative and qualitative measures

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.600

[Unknown]: cm.social slash seen unseen.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Hey, I want to repeat that URL cm.social slash seen unseen.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.560
[Amit Varma]: Deepak has been a guest on my podcast and he handles my money as well.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.640
[Amit Varma]: My actions are the best endorsement.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.520
[Amit Varma]: Mahima, welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.520
[Guest]: Thanks Amit.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.520
[Amit Varma]: Thanks for having me.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'm so glad to have you on.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.520
[Amit Varma]: I'm so glad you agreed.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.440
[Amit Varma]: I spent last night and today morning kind of going through your newsletter also.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.760
[Amit Varma]: And while in the past I've expressed my admiration, great discipline, you know, I admire it so

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.960
[Amit Varma]: much that week after week, you can just have the discipline to sit down and put it out,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.120
[Amit Varma]: especially because it's not just you sitting and writing, you're talking to people and

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.600
[Amit Varma]: you're constructing those and I really love that.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.240
[Amit Varma]: But while I was aware, it was only when I read all the posts and I was taking notes

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.560
[Amit Varma]: that I thought that this is really a formidable body of work.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.280
[Amit Varma]: So you should be so proud.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.400
[Guest]: Thank you.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.920
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's let's sort of start by talking about you by now, you know, the template of the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
[Amit Varma]: show.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.600
[Amit Varma]: So let's let's start by talking about sort of your personal journey, which is, you know,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.520
[Amit Varma]: a really unconventional sort of route that you've taken to to where you are, where you've

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.440
[Amit Varma]: done your engineering, you've done your MBA, you joined the civil services.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.280
[Amit Varma]: And now while you are, of course, you know, working with the Swachh Bharat program and

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.800
[Amit Varma]: all of that, but at the same time, this newsletter is outstanding.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.800
[Amit Varma]: It's just great.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.800
[Amit Varma]: So you're part of the creator economy in a sense, you're doing a podcast as well.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.120
[Amit Varma]: But take me back to where were you born, where did you grow up?

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.120
[Amit Varma]: How was that like?

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.160
[Guest]: Yeah, I've listened to a lot of episodes of your podcast and always wondered that how

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.160
[Guest]: how are people's lives so interesting, like people are reading books in in beside rivers

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.360
[Guest]: flowing behind their homes and all and I always felt like my upbringing was very, very average

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.040
[Guest]: by those standards.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.760
[Guest]: But but we'll go there anyway.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.400
[Guest]: So I'm basically from a partition refugee family.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.960
[Guest]: My paternal grandparents were children or young adults when partition happened.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.800
[Guest]: And so both of my Dada and Dadi have, they've told us stories about how they went through

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.080
[Guest]: it.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.600
[Guest]: My grandfather was in Xavier's Mumbai when partition happened and he was studying engineering

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.600
[Guest]: there.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:15.360
[Guest]: And so his family was stuck beside beyond the border and he was here in India.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.000
[Guest]: And so there was all of that anxiety in those days with no communication channel, whether

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.240
[Guest]: your loved ones are even okay, whether they're even alive.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:30.040
[Guest]: My grandmother had this very, very, that in Hindi you say dil dehla dene wali story of

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.840
[Guest]: how they were.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.840
[Guest]: She was one of 14 siblings.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.840
[Guest]: They were all children.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.920
[Guest]: They had a house in Lahore and there was a warehouse like go down under their house and

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.440
[Guest]: wahan pe they used to store bade bade bartano mein wheat and rice and things like that.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:52.840
[Guest]: So how they as children hid inside those huge containers because the houses were being homes

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.840
[Guest]: were being raided and there were riots in the streets, of course, and Hindus are not

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.840
[Guest]: safe there.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.400
[Guest]: Muslims are not safe here.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.540
[Guest]: And so they hid in those gigantic containers for a week, 10 days, and they lived on eating

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.320
[Guest]: those raw grains of wheat and rice.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.880
[Guest]: That's how they survived it.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.520
[Guest]: And then, you know, suddenly news would come, ke ek train jaa rahi hai, chalo.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.920
[Guest]: And aadi raat ko some children are going in one batch, some are going in the other.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.760
[Guest]: And again, you don't know whether you're being separated from your siblings.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.080
[Guest]: You don't know whether you'll even see them again.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.240
[Guest]: So so very, very shocking, disturbing stories from there.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:36.120
[Guest]: Then they came to Delhi and they settled here in a in a refugee colony.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.480
[Guest]: I believe my grandmother was elsewhere and later when she got married, she moved in obviously

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.240
[Guest]: with my grandfather.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.080
[Guest]: And my great grandmother was the matriarch of the family at the time.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.840
[Guest]: I remember my dad still tells me the story of how at that time, you know, these refugee

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.600
[Guest]: colonies were being offered and unko koi, I don't know, a defense colony, ya kahin

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.720
[Guest]: Kalka ji kahin pe, she was getting a house.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.120
[Guest]: And at that time, Delhi mein, it was like she, she literally refused that house saying

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.120
[Guest]: wahan jangal mein jaa ke kaun rahega.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.640
[Guest]: And today my dad is like, if she had said yes at that time, our lives would have been

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.120
[Guest]: very different right now.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:19.520
[Guest]: But anyway, so then she, so then she came, moved here with my grandfather who had one

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.800
[Guest]: sibling, my grandmother who had 13 siblings.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.280
[Guest]: And then they got married, they had four sons, one of, third one was my father.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.860
[Guest]: My mother's side again, four siblings, third one was my mother.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:38.760
[Guest]: My mom's side is another interesting story of great struggle, I think.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:45.040
[Guest]: So my mom's mother was again one of just two siblings, because my mom's grandfather passed

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:51.600
[Guest]: away very soon after his marriage to my great grandmother on that side, my great nani on

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.000
[Guest]: that side.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.960
[Guest]: And I think it was a Spanish flu or something at that time, which took a lot of lives and

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.760
[Guest]: many young adults passed away suddenly.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.240
[Guest]: And so many families were left with no parents or single parents.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.200
[Guest]: And so my great nani was suddenly widowed at a very young age, she had two children

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.280
[Guest]: and she self educated herself and became actually a school principal, which at that time did

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.800
[Guest]: not take like a huge amount of education.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.400
[Guest]: But even with basic education, you could become that.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:29.400
[Guest]: And so she was a self made woman in that era, a woman who was in a job earning and raising

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.520
[Guest]: a family on her own, which was very, very admirable.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.080
[Guest]: And then my nani had actually had nine children, which I found out much later in life, that

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.000
[Guest]: my mom had had five siblings who never made it beyond the first year of their life.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.640
[Guest]: So I mean, when I think about it, I can't imagine how a parent, a mother says especially

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.820
[Guest]: goes on after losing five children and then going on to have more children.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.840
[Guest]: But that was I guess the way of those times, you know, it was just a fact of life that

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.480
[Guest]: some children will not make it.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:06.320
[Guest]: I mean, very common diseases like diarrhea and all, which today utterly preventable,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.920
[Guest]: you take ORS, you will be fine.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.920
[Guest]: At that time, children would actually lose lives and parents would lose children to that.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:19.040
[Guest]: Anyway, so then after somehow, luckily after number six, she had four children who made

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.760
[Guest]: it and then my mom was the third of those four.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:30.480
[Guest]: So I much later in life found out that my mom was actually number nine, not nine, seven,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.480
[Guest]: eight.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.880
[Guest]: Yes, we'll have to edit this.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.320
[Guest]: So much later in life, I found out my mom was not the third child, she was actually

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.360
[Guest]: the eighth child in that family.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:46.240
[Guest]: So yeah, then my parents, my dad, I think had his initial years of his education in

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:54.240
[Guest]: Kanpur, and then they moved back to Delhi, because my dadaji was an engineer and he used

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.800
[Guest]: to work in these repair of theatre equipment.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.880
[Guest]: So there was a lot of travelling, because at that time in India, there were only so

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.840
[Guest]: many, single screen obviously, and there were very few of those.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.920
[Guest]: So he used to travel a lot, be on tour a lot.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:15.760
[Guest]: And so my dadi used to stay in Delhi at home with her, with the four boys.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.440
[Guest]: I think both my parents had very humble beginnings, that way, I studied in a government school

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.240
[Guest]: and Hindi medium, they tell me stories of, you know, sitting on the floor in a broken

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:35.080
[Guest]: tent, and teachers are obviously not interested, and very few who would actually have a stake

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.780
[Guest]: in teaching at all, mostly just going through the motions.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:44.360
[Guest]: But then they were, both of them had this very strong work ethic and this strong desire

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.000
[Guest]: to love for education.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.680
[Guest]: So they kind of, again, were self-taught in a way.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.120
[Guest]: My father ended up doing an MA in English, having come from a Hindi medium school, almost

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.400
[Guest]: overnight taught himself English.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.400
[Guest]: By reading the dictionary, like that's how he would tell me that he would read a sentence

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.920
[Guest]: and then come across four new words in that sentence, and then go back to the dictionary

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.360
[Guest]: and look up their meaning and then read the next sentence.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.280
[Guest]: So that's an intense amount of work to put into learning a language, but that's how,

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.280
[Guest]: that's how he did it.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.280
[Guest]: And he went on to do an MA in English.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:21.720
[Guest]: My mom also did a master's later in life and was a BA in the, when they got married.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:27.040
[Guest]: They got married in 1985, and that's the year later that year I was born.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.640
[Guest]: And then two years later, I had a younger brother.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.280
[Guest]: I don't remember much from my early years, but I mostly grew up in Delhi.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.960
[Guest]: And my parents were, like I said, you know, great love for education and despite humble

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.220
[Guest]: beginnings and both of them were bankers for most of my life.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.600
[Guest]: They were in public sector banks and again transferable jobs.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.960
[Guest]: So we used to change schools a lot, even within Delhi.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.800
[Guest]: So in my life, in the 12 years of schooling, I've changed 10 schools.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.920
[Guest]: So that's a significant amount of nomadic lifestyle to have.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:07.320
[Guest]: But that was, I think it was good in hindsight and it was a little tough at that time maybe,

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.320
[Guest]: but it was, it was good.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.240
[Guest]: I mean, it made me very comfortable and adjustable.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.640
[Guest]: I would make friends easily.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.800
[Guest]: I would settle in new circumstances easily.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.760
[Guest]: And they used to, I mean, we went to the best of the schools, my brother and I.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.920
[Guest]: My parents, again, like I said, love for education.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.280
[Guest]: So that was very important to them.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.800
[Guest]: It was a very important ethic that they built into us also that, you know, one is a love

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.800
[Guest]: for education.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.520
[Guest]: And the other thing that they probably didn't teach us consciously, but we picked up was

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.800
[Guest]: value for money.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.240
[Guest]: Because somehow, I don't, they never said it to us, but at least for me, I imbibed it

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.400
[Guest]: quite early in life that they are not, it's not easy for them to send me to this school.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.280
[Guest]: They are making sacrifices and the least I can do is study well.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.760
[Guest]: So I used to be like class topper all through school and everything, very, very boring,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.680
[Guest]: typical Delhi type story.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.840
[Guest]: And we used to have all these holidays, these classes, so we also became a bit of jack of

00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.840
[Guest]: all trades.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:11.560
[Guest]: We learned a bit of dancing, a bit of Bhadrat Natyam, a bit of Kathak, a bit of singing,

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.560
[Guest]: a bit of painting, a bit of this and that.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.560
[Guest]: Like we would be shunted out of the house during summer.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.960
[Guest]: So kind of picked up a lot of things alongside education, alongside academics early in life.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:23.920
[Guest]: And then I think the big, I mean, it must have been skipping a lot of things here, but

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.240
[Guest]: I think the next big milestone happened in our lives when I was in 10th standard.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.640
[Guest]: I mean, in Delhi, it starts after 9th, no more going downstairs to play, less of friends,

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.200
[Guest]: now focus on studies, the year of the board exam is coming, so prepare for 10th in 9th,

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.640
[Guest]: write the board in 10th, then prepare for 12th in 11th, then write the board in 12th.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.760
[Guest]: So that is basically, and the story you were told was that if you study these two years,

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.080
[Guest]: then your life is set.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.200
[Guest]: Of course, that story carries on later also, that if you do this entrance, then your life

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.200
[Guest]: is set.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.200
[Guest]: Then if you write that exam, then your life is set.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.200
[Guest]: That goes on, but at that time, obviously, you are children and you fall for this, fall

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.640
[Guest]: for this pitch.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:09.600
[Guest]: So we, so I was like very hardcore 10th is like, this is the do or die year of life.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:15.040
[Guest]: And in that year, some leadership change happened in my mom's bank.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.520
[Guest]: And until that time, they had a policy of not transferring women, because they were

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.200
[Guest]: like working mothers have it tough enough as it is, let's not make life worse for them.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.240
[Guest]: Already the husbands are moving around, and they have to adjust with that.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.760
[Guest]: A lot of years, I grew up with my dad living in some village in UP, and then commuting

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.320
[Guest]: every week to come see us.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.520
[Guest]: Aisa hota tha bahut.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.440
[Guest]: So my mom was like the one fixture ke theek hai, she is going to be in Delhi, she is going

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.440
[Guest]: to be in this house.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.440
[Guest]: So we don't have to change schools as often.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.920
[Guest]: But then that year, when I was in 10th, there was a leadership change in her organization.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:51.480
[Guest]: And the man who came in was, was for some reason had a bone to pick with women.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.480
[Guest]: He said, transfer all the women, bahut ho gaya, baithi hoon hi hain kap, ek hi jaga pe.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.640
[Guest]: So usne utha ke, sabko, and not even like transfer them locally, from one Delhi office

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.360
[Guest]: to another, or within departments, no, transfer them to other cities, where they've never

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.240
[Guest]: been and don't want to go.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.960
[Guest]: So my mom was transferred to Ahmedabad.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.880
[Guest]: So suddenly, like I said, humara pura plan tha na, ke 9th to 12th, ghar mein cable TV

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.600
[Guest]: kat jayega, baith ke padhai karni hai.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.080
[Guest]: And then the plan got disrupted in the most crucial year.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:27.200
[Guest]: So my dad, to his credit at the time, said that, you know, this is a crucial year for

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.280
[Guest]: Mahima's education, and we need to keep the family together.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.060
[Guest]: Because earlier we went by ourselves, and it was a huge struggle for my mother to manage

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:41.360
[Guest]: the new house, new culture, bachchon ke nahi school, her own new office, her own office

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.420
[Guest]: ka dynamics and politics.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.680
[Guest]: It was just too much for her to do by herself.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.920
[Guest]: And she would every day tell him, when are you coming here?

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:55.640
[Guest]: And so to his huge credit, he took VRS in a year that, it was like quite early in his

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.880
[Guest]: career at that time.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.560
[Guest]: So people would tell him ke, oh, you're making the biggest mistake of your life.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.480
[Guest]: And he was like, nahi, my family needs me, and he prioritized that.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.800
[Guest]: Again, a very, very, very modern take for a, decision for a man to take at that time,

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.800
[Guest]: that I will quit my job and my wife will continue to earn, because she doesn't have the option

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.200
[Guest]: of VRS right now.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.720
[Guest]: So she would have to resign and just sit at home with no pay, I will at least get a pension.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.720
[Guest]: So theek hai.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.520
[Guest]: And I'll do something of my own.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.920
[Guest]: So he did that, which was massive, a huge sacrifice for which I'm indebted forever,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.480
[Guest]: because again, something that could have changed the direction of our lives completely.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:35.480
[Guest]: So he came and joined us in Ahmedabad, and I suffered a lot in terms of academics and

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.320
[Guest]: to the extent that a 10th standard child can suffer, basically.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.400
[Guest]: Huge culture shift, children in my school suddenly speaking Gujarati and telling me

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.400
[Guest]: I have a Punjabi accent, which until that time, no one had pointed out because, well,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.360
[Guest]: I guess all of us had Punjabi accents, so no one points it out.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:57.120
[Guest]: But then when I go there, they say, oh, the way you say this thing, this is very Punjabi,

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.440
[Guest]: this is very Delhi type.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.880
[Guest]: So I would be very conscious about the way I speak.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.360
[Guest]: I was the new kid in a class, in a school where 10th standard was the last class.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.080
[Guest]: Toh wo bachche KG se saath mein padhte hua rahe the, and I am suddenly middle of the

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:14.080
[Guest]: year, airdropped into this classroom where nobody knows me and nobody cares at this stage

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.120
[Guest]: of their life to make new friends.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:23.240
[Guest]: So very difficult adjustment, and I was this cocky class topper, teacher's pet in Delhi

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.800
[Guest]: school, toh Delhi mein my school so far.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:31.360
[Guest]: So I was like completely out of my comfort zone, my marks plummeted and like I said again,

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:37.080
[Guest]: the most life-defining crucial do or die year of my life, and my brother was having his

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.680
[Guest]: own set of issues, he was getting bullied by the boys in his class.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.160
[Guest]: And so we had a very difficult adjustment that year.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:50.000
[Guest]: That year also, there was floods in Gujarat, in Ahmedabad, and our school was in a low-lying

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
[Guest]: area.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.760
[Guest]: So I remember school ka poora ground floor tak paani bhar gaya, we were all moved to the

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.680
[Guest]: first floor, and then first floor mein paani bharne lagya.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.120
[Guest]: So then some army people came and humko utha, waha se rassi baand ke, nikaal ke leke gaye,

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.780
[Guest]: and we were evacuated.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.800
[Guest]: So that was my first brush with natural disasters.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:14.560
[Guest]: So anyway, lot of stuff happened, and by God's grace or hard work, parents, blessings, everything,

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.720
[Guest]: I actually ended up topping West India that year.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.920
[Guest]: From going from like 68% marks ho gaye the meri, I was this always, 95 se upar rahe na

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.920
[Guest]: chahiye.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.920
[Guest]: 90 bhi nahi, 95 se upar aana chahiye.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.240
[Guest]: Maths mein 25 mein se 24 and a half kyun aaye, half mark kahan kata?

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:36.000
[Guest]: That was the big, big pain points of my life were those, until that year.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.880
[Guest]: From that year, I came down to like academics mein kahi nahi, all, everything changed suddenly,

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.560
[Guest]: and which was, again, in hindsight, I think it was a change that I needed.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.160
[Guest]: It was a reality check that I needed, like I said, I was getting rather comfortable and

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.160
[Guest]: cocky in Delhi.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:57.640
[Guest]: Toh 10th hua, phir then 11th mein changed into state board, Gujarat board, went there

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:03.320
[Guest]: for 10 days and decided ke yeh toh bhai, these textbooks are like 100 pages and I'm not going

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.200
[Guest]: to, this is not okay.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.680
[Guest]: I'm not going to fit in here.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:12.960
[Guest]: So then I got to, came back into central board, Kendra Vidyalaya, then 12th mein ek aur school

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.960
[Guest]: badla.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:19.080
[Guest]: I did a bit of IIT prep over there, which again, Ahmedabad had no coaching classes or

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.200
[Guest]: anything at that time.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.760
[Guest]: So there was this one class and I remember I went, I joined there, woh nahi nahi khuli

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:29.160
[Guest]: thi and I went there, first day I sat next to a boy and I was like, you know, looking

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.600
[Guest]: for validation, have I come to the right place even?

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.240
[Guest]: So I asked this guy that, you know, what do you know about this class, why did you choose

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.240
[Guest]: it?

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.040
[Guest]: This, and then he was like, this is the best class in Ahmedabad.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.040
[Guest]: I said, why?

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:46.880
[Guest]: He said, don't you know, Mahima Vashishth comes to this class and I was like, what?

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.240
[Guest]: Because I had topped West India na, akbaar wagar mein naam chhap gaya tha mera.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.560
[Guest]: And then somehow word travelled that I had joined this class.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.200
[Guest]: And then I realised that people are here because I am here, I don't know why I am here.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:04.000
[Guest]: So we are all in one boat, sink or swim and basically we sank, that boat sank because

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
[Guest]: I didn't clear IIT.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.120
[Guest]: Like I cleared and I got some like 6000 rank or something, which at that time would have

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:16.240
[Guest]: given you mining engineering in one, bahut door ka koi college and so that was not it.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:22.520
[Guest]: And then I also gave AIEEE, I also gave medical because I had bio also, lot of, har jagah

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:28.240
[Guest]: haath pyaar maara and finally I got into AIEEE ek exam, ussi saal start hua tha, the All-India

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.560
[Guest]: Engineering Entrance Examination.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.400
[Guest]: And until then, that year you had to apply separately to every college you wanted to

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.400
[Guest]: go into.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.480
[Guest]: So if you, there are 50 colleges, big, big league colleges, you have to fill 50 application

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.480
[Guest]: forms and write 50 exams.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:46.680
[Guest]: So thankfully from my year only it had started and I wrote that exam and I got into an NIT,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.720
[Guest]: National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:54.160
[Guest]: Usse upar rank mein the, uss samay bhi and NIT Surat was local for us, Gujarat mein.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:59.480
[Guest]: And NIT Allahabad, I remember was one of the highest ranked and I could have, with my marks

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.440
[Guest]: and rank, I could have gotten into it and I remember my parents, we went to that counselling

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.960
[Guest]: centre jahan pe yeh diya jata hai, aapko yeh branch aur yeh NIT mil raha hai.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.000
[Guest]: And waha jaa ke we had applied and the counselling centre guy told us ki dekho, NIT Allahabad

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.320
[Guest]: is good, but ladkiyon ke liye theek nahi hai, waha pe pathar chalte hain, waha pe bachche

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.600
[Guest]: exam hall mein chhuri leke aa jaate hain.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.200
[Guest]: So that was enough for my parents, okay, good career but thanks, no thanks.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.680
[Guest]: So they put me in the next best at the time which was NIT Kurukshetra.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.600
[Guest]: So then I went for the first time, left my home and lot of rona dhona in the train I

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:41.040
[Guest]: remember to Kurukshetra and then my dad took me there, dropped me off, got me a hostel

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:47.480
[Guest]: room and everything and then four years of engineering happened there, where it was,

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:52.280
[Guest]: it was nice, it was very nice, at that time at least because academically I was good,

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:58.040
[Guest]: I was sorted because I had had all this rigorous background of studying and I was good at cracking

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.040
[Guest]: exams.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.000
[Guest]: So aa jaate the acche number, I used to be again topper popper in all semesters.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.400
[Guest]: But more than that, what I really liked about that experience was the kind of grooming that

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.600
[Guest]: it was for my personality, I joined a lot of, I was the chief editor of the college

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:19.440
[Guest]: magazine, technical society mein, executive member, matlab aisa extracurricular bahut

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.440
[Guest]: kuch.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.040
[Guest]: I used to play sports, I used to be cultural events, kuch na kuch.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:30.720
[Guest]: So I was always busy, I was always up to something and it was again at that time very uncharacteristic

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.440
[Guest]: for a girl to be this active in these things because it was, you know, quizzing is boys

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:40.360
[Guest]: ka area, literature and debate club is boys ka area, magazine likhna is boys ka area.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:46.720
[Guest]: And so I was this outsider who was, they would select girls in these clubs, but mostly it

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.640
[Guest]: was seen as eye candy, ki chalo thodi ladkiya bhi leke aatein club mein.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:56.440
[Guest]: And then by the time of, by the senior years, most girls would peter out in participation

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.920
[Guest]: because there was no, really no support from the organization, from the institution or

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.640
[Guest]: from the culture within the students also.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.840
[Guest]: It was not very friendly for girls.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.680
[Guest]: So I remember there was, we used to have a girls' hostel and usmein girls' timing was

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.200
[Guest]: like 4.30 ko lectures khatam hua hai, 5.30 tak aapko andar hona hai.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.960
[Guest]: So basically you had one hour to go eat a samosa in the canteen and enjoy campus life

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.080
[Guest]: as it were.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.960
[Guest]: And for boys, obviously, puri raat campus mein yahaan pe daru leke peeke padha hua hain

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.200
[Guest]: and they're like living it up there.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.800
[Guest]: Not that daru is the measure of living it up, but the access to that public space, after

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:37.320
[Guest]: hours to go sit outside college library and, you know, have all those memories, build those

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.200
[Guest]: memories which people look back on.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:45.400
[Guest]: We got no such chances because we were sheep, cattle herded into the hostel at sundown.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.960
[Guest]: So summers ke time thodo zyada time milta tha, winters mein toh bas class khatam hui,

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.800
[Guest]: ek ghante ke andar sunset ho jayega, aap chalo bhaago.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:58.040
[Guest]: That I felt it was very, very restrictive and in hindsight it was quite misogynistic

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:03.200
[Guest]: because the wardens and their attitude was ki yeh jagah safe nahi hai ladkiyon ke liye.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.320
[Guest]: Haryana hai, yahaan pe ladkiyan chhed dete hain, yahaan pe ladkiyon ko utha ke le jate

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.880
[Guest]: hain, hum aapko nahi jaane de sakte bhaar.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:15.800
[Guest]: Aapki betiyaan humari zimmedaari hain and they would tell our parents ki aap socho,

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.400
[Guest]: main inki parent ki tarah soch rahi hu, agar meri beti hoti toh main yeh karti.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.520
[Guest]: And I was like, well, we are living on campus.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.680
[Guest]: This is your area.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.720
[Guest]: If you are not able to protect a student in this area, that's on you.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.720
[Guest]: That's not on the student.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.960
[Guest]: You cannot penalize the student because she happens to be a girl.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:38.160
[Guest]: But anyway, at that time, we didn't have such voice and khudi apne andar itni internalized

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.240
[Guest]: misogyny thi ki hum accept bhi khale the ki haan bhai yeh hi sahi, yeh aise hi life hai.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.400
[Guest]: So I remember for college magazine printing waqara karane ke liye, I used to go aadi raat

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.320
[Guest]: ko printer ki shop pe and tell yahaan pe ki, Karnal mein meri maasi hai, wo bimaar hai,

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:56.040
[Guest]: mujh unke dekhne jaana hai, aise karke I used to write these applications, get it signed

00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.200
[Guest]: by a friend as my aunt or local guardian or something, and then give it to the warden.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.120
[Guest]: And the warden also often would see through it.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.200
[Guest]: She'd be like, haan mujhe pata hai yeh kaunsi maasi hai, Karnal mujhe baar baar bimaar hoti

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.200
[Amit Varma]: hai.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.200
[Amit Varma]: We have a maasi in Karnal.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200
[Amit Varma]: I don't know.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.200
[Amit Varma]: I have no one in Karnal.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.440
[Guest]: It was just the nearest town.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.160
[Guest]: So anyway, I mean, she, I think she thought I was going out with a boy or something, which

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.080
[Guest]: was where their mind always went.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:25.080
[Guest]: So there was a lot of slut shaming, unneedlessly, ki aap, matlab literally, I was a student

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.840
[Guest]: going out to participate in an extracurricular college campus activity, which was benefiting

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.240
[Guest]: me, benefiting the campus.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.760
[Guest]: It is a part of the kind of all round development that you should be offering your students,

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.760
[Guest]: you should be encouraging in your students, but instead you are penalizing them, you're

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.200
[Guest]: slut shaming them, you're telling them ki aadi raat ko ladkiya andher mein jaake kya

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.400
[Guest]: karti hain ladko ke saath humein pata hai.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.760
[Guest]: This is literally a line that the chief warden has told me.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.320
[Guest]: These were the, that was the kind of atmosphere where you had to really, this is also the

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.040
[Guest]: reason why most girls would peter out of clubs and societies and all, right?

00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:00.720
[Guest]: For me, it was just a passion and I was, I found a lot of meaning and joy in that.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.520
[Guest]: So I used to, I used to find my ways around it.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.520
[Guest]: So that, all that happened, four years of college went out that way.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.440
[Guest]: In hindsight, again, much more misogyny that I see there now than I saw at that time, which

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.200
[Guest]: was probably good for my mental health that I didn't see it that time, otherwise, krantikari

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.480
[Guest]: ban jate hoon, chaar saal tak mein moorchai nikalti rehti.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.240
[Guest]: The atmosphere in Gurukshetra was also very, I mean, it had all sorts of other issues also.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:30.360
[Guest]: There's a lot of toxic masculinity also, literally, there were boys in our college who would go

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.560
[Guest]: out in the evening on bikes and, malab ladki jaariya peeche se uske baal kheechke chale

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:40.000
[Guest]: gaye, pen chhen liya, knock off her books or something, you know, just like, it was

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.680
[Guest]: harmless words like, if teasing are used for it, it is sexual harassment.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:49.040
[Guest]: And that was very common on campus, more from the boys who would come from outside than

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:55.480
[Guest]: the boys from within campus, but everyone had access and everyone, Gurukshetra University

00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:01.760
[Guest]: is like a thousand acre campus in which 300 acres is NIT Gurukshetra, within the campus.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.000
[Guest]: So Gurukshetra University, KAU bolte the, KAU ke ladke andar aate the, KAU ke ladko

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.640
[Guest]: ko hamare naam, details, phone number pata hote the, like, men we've never met, don't

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.480
[Guest]: know that they exist, they know everything about our lives.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:20.040
[Guest]: So that was the extent of scrutiny that girls would be under in that surrounding.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.920
[Guest]: And there was, like I said, a lot of toxic masculinity in our third year, I think I was

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.000
[Guest]: in third year, when there was an incident of violence between boys.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.240
[Guest]: So there were gangs of boys there and one gang beat up the other gang or they, somebody

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:39.680
[Guest]: brought a hockey stick and somebody brought a fawda, spade.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.520
[Guest]: And so this was, became famous as the fawda incident on campus, ke ek ladke ne doose ladke

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.880
[Guest]: ka sar khol diya fawda maarke.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:53.680
[Guest]: And basically that boy, I think he later survived, but he had some lifelong paralysis or some

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:59.240
[Guest]: issue, obviously, like literally his head was cracked open by another student.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:03.160
[Guest]: So that was the extent of stuff that the boys on campus were dealing.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.200
[Guest]: So credit to them also where it belongs.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.840
[Guest]: And I remember there was a long break, suddenly humari chhutiyan kar di gayi, we were sent

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:17.920
[Guest]: home and some boys went underground and they had parents who were Haryana ka IPS officer,

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:23.040
[Guest]: uska father hai and then somehow he was bailed out, the guy who did this and all of that

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.840
[Guest]: weird parallel universe also existed while I was working on my magazines and clubs and

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.160
[Guest]: little cute little things.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:36.240
[Guest]: That was a context and general scene in which Kurukshetra happened.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:41.800
[Guest]: Towards the end, in my final year, I got placed into campus placement, say I got two jobs,

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.000
[Guest]: but then I also wrote CAT in that year.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.760
[Guest]: And again, it was very unlikely that I would have cleared it because no, no coaching class

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.240
[Guest]: again in Kurukshetra.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:58.400
[Guest]: So I did this distance wala mock test thing, time ka usam hota tha and lot of my batchmates

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:04.720
[Guest]: used to had just given up on studies and extracurriculars in the final year ke rose train leke weekend

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.480
[Guest]: pe Delhi jaake career launcher ki class mein padha hi karke aayenge and I was here till

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.720
[Guest]: the last day running around organizing fests and everything in college as the final year

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.120
[Guest]: student who was still not given that legitimacy because I was a girl, we'll come back to that

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.120
[Guest]: later.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:25.040
[Guest]: But there was in the final year, yeah, I used to go, I used to do this distance thing for

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:30.000
[Guest]: mock tests, and then I was the surprise candidate who cleared CAT.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.480
[Guest]: And then toh fir isliye I didn't join any job and I went on to IIM Bangalore after that

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.480
[Guest]: right after campus.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.000
[Guest]: IIM Bangalore was a whole other universe because like I said, Kurukshetra mein academically

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.120
[Guest]: I was very, very comfortable.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:48.360
[Guest]: By the end of it, I had a 9.9 CGP out of 10, which was log sunte hain toh aankhe fad jati

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.360
[Guest]: hain.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.720
[Guest]: But for me, I feel like I was actually not that hard because like I said, I had become

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.720
[Guest]: quite good at cracking the Indian education system.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:02.720
[Guest]: Toh mujhe pada tha exam mein kaisa poochenge, how to do smart prep the night before the

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:07.520
[Guest]: exam and then the night after the exam, I would press a reset button, so today I cannot

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.480
[Guest]: tell you what a microprocessor is with a gun to my head.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:16.520
[Guest]: So that was, I am an electronics engineer by the way, so that's quite shameful to admit.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.760
[Guest]: I went into IIM Bangalore after that.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:24.760
[Guest]: Wahape, it was a whole other, academic comfort se coming there was a very different experience

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:29.320
[Guest]: because wahape saare ek topper the, wahape toh yeh tha ki bhai pattar peko topper ko

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.320
[Guest]: lagega.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:36.680
[Guest]: So it was, everybody there was exceptional people academically at least, but probably

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.720
[Guest]: not as diverse.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.140
[Guest]: So we were a batch of 249 people out of which 227 were engineers.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:48.240
[Guest]: So we all, we, different degrees of genius, but all thinking the same way, sabka dimaag

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.560
[Guest]: train ki tarah ek hi line pe chalta hai.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:57.160
[Guest]: So I think there were like less than 20 or so people from arts and yeh sab background

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.520
[Guest]: who were just brought in for diversity, usse mein yeh hota tha ki is cheez ke marks zyada

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.640
[Guest]: milte hain, ki agar aapne CAT kar liya aur aapka arts background hai, toh wo aapko zyada

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.920
[Guest]: marks denge interviewer kyunki they want that diversity on campus, but obviously we were

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:15.240
[Guest]: not doing a good enough job of diversity because we are still very, very engineering dominated.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.920
[Guest]: So I would actually love interacting with those students who came from different backgrounds

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.840
[Guest]: because they brought a very different way of thinking to things.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.920
[Guest]: And I was a fresher, which, what is called a fresher, which is that no work experience,

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.640
[Guest]: directly engineering ke baad MBA.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:35.760
[Guest]: So I also got a lot of different life perspectives from my batchmates who had work experience

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.520
[Guest]: because they would have this attitude of yeh sab se kuch fark nahi padta hai, humne dekha

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:44.200
[Guest]: hai real life mein, whereas the freshers like us were like, areh marks, areh exam, areh

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.200
[Guest]: yeh.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:50.680
[Guest]: So I kind of evolved beyond that because I surrounded myself with friends who didn't

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.560
[Guest]: care as much about academics and about all of that.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:33:00.560
[Guest]: So we did decently well, passably okay in IIM, I was no, no gold medalist there.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.320
[Guest]: I went on in student exchange while there in my, they were, doh saal mein there are

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.720
[Guest]: three trimesters, so, sorry, six trimesters.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.840
[Guest]: So fifth trimester is a student exchange program, which I did in Germany, in a college, B school

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.840
[Guest]: in Germany.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:20.760
[Guest]: So for me, that was the highlight of my MBA, ke I got to travel abroad and live in another

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:28.360
[Guest]: country in a rented apartment with other students and hum log, we were like the only 16 Indians

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.600
[Guest]: in a hundred kilometer radius around there.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:36.400
[Guest]: So hum log milke chole chawal bana rahe hain, raat ko to get a taste of our food and learnt

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:41.720
[Guest]: how to cook, learnt how to manage a household to the extent a student does.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.640
[Guest]: And I was, I did a lot of traveling, I traveled like to like some 11 countries.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.800
[Guest]: So again, academics was the last thing on our mind, ke ye to hoyi jaayega.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.800
[Guest]: And I remember humara jab exam hua tha waha pe, toh Indian students were leaving so fast

00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:00.520
[Guest]: because like we have been conditioned to game the education system so well that the poor

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:05.320
[Guest]: Germans, agar teen mahina pehle project diya hai, toh wo log teen mahine ka ek wo banayenge,

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:10.400
[Guest]: poora timeline chart, ke pehle hafte hum ye karenge, doosra hafta we will visualize,

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.680
[Guest]: teesra hafta we will find data, chautha hafta we will do primary research for this.

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:20.080
[Guest]: And Indians are like, ye deadline kab hai, ek raat pehle baithenge, night out maarenge,

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.080
[Guest]: ho jaayega.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.840
[Guest]: Sounds just like me, I gotta tell you.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.400
[Guest]: I know, you did that right, like last night baithke moomaning padha hai poora.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.400
[Amit Varma]: Siddhi si baat hai, kya karein.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:34.120
[Guest]: So humara culture woh hai, toh we kind of were like, all of us were the worst project

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:39.120
[Guest]: partners, it became like a racist thing almost, ki Indians ko project partner mat banao, they'll

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:44.120
[Guest]: turn up one night before the thing, whereas those, I mean German, French, even Chinese

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.520
[Guest]: sincere students are there slogging for three months, aur hum ek raat pehle prakat hoke

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.280
[Guest]: bolenge, chalo, batao meri kitni slides hai.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.920
[Guest]: Anyway, so we were, the joke was that on that day when we were all writing the exam, the

00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:00.480
[Guest]: Indian students were leaving so fast that the examiner stopped one of us and was like,

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.800
[Guest]: show me your wallet, and you have definitely cheated, how are you leaving so fast?

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.760
[Guest]: And he was like, I haven't, like literally, I know the answers, jutta mujhe pata hai surface

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.240
[Guest]: hai, main lik diya hai, aur mujhe pata hai main pass ho jaunga, itte main.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.200
[Guest]: And pretty much that was the attitude of all of us there, satisficing to the worst level,

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.200
[Guest]: in the worst way possible.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:23.520
[Guest]: So yeah, the education and all was secondary there, but the cross-cultural experience was

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:28.000
[Guest]: very, very, was very interesting, and I think that contributed much more to our growth.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's double click on a few things and then we'll rejoin this journey.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.120
[Amit Varma]: So a whole bunch of things to double click on, I want to go back to when you were talking

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:43.560
[Amit Varma]: at the start about how you learned about, you know, the experiences of your grandparents

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.000
[Amit Varma]: during partition and all of that, and how they came over and what they went through.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.480
[Amit Varma]: And I've also sort of been thinking for a long time, and it's a thought that came up

00:35:53.480 --> 00:36:02.040
[Amit Varma]: again when I read your post, is that women always have this sort of extra layer of obstacles

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.320
[Amit Varma]: to overcome to get to whatever they're doing.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:10.200
[Amit Varma]: I remember I'd done this episode I really enjoyed with Kavita Rao, who'd written about

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.600
[Amit Varma]: the lady doctors of the 19th century.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.400
[Amit Varma]: And some of the stories that are stunning, like the one that moved me a lot, and I keep

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:22.640
[Amit Varma]: going back to is that of Hemabati Sen, who was born in this village somewhere in what

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.480
[Amit Varma]: was then Bangladesh in the 1840s or 1850s, right?

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.600
[Amit Varma]: She was married off to a middle-aged widower at the age of nine.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.560
[Amit Varma]: During the day, she would play with his children.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.400
[Amit Varma]: During the night, she would forget what happened, but basically she would wake up naked and

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.560
[Amit Varma]: bleeding, right?

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.480
[Amit Varma]: This went on for a couple of years until her husband died, his parents died, her parents

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.480
[Amit Varma]: died.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.000
[Amit Varma]: So she's 11 years old, and her family basically kicks her out on the street and she's got

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.040
[Amit Varma]: no money.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:53.080
[Amit Varma]: So parents are dead, both sets of parents, husband is dead, you'd imagine life is over.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:57.160
[Amit Varma]: She's 11 years old, no money, village in Bangladesh, right, 1850s.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.600
[Amit Varma]: She makes her way from there to be one of India's first lady doctors.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.760
[Amit Varma]: And she achieves positions of eminence in terms of the first woman head of a guild or

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.800
[Amit Varma]: whatever I forgot in the details.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.320
[Amit Varma]: She writes a diary about her life.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:14.240
[Amit Varma]: And after she dies, that diary is lost in a trunk, which isn't open for 85 years.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.560
[Amit Varma]: And then in the 1990s or the early 2000s, somebody opens it and it's published as a

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.640
[Amit Varma]: memoirs of Hemabati Sen, you can, you know, read it online.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.080
[Amit Varma]: And not just this story, because one story can be an outlier.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:31.760
[Amit Varma]: But reading about the lady doctors of the 1900s, what struck me was that to be a lady

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.160
[Amit Varma]: doctor at all, forget how good a doctor forget what you achieve, just to be a lady doctor,

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:41.440
[Amit Varma]: you had to be ridiculously outstanding, you had to have immense character, immense strength,

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.840
[Amit Varma]: you had to have overcome a lot.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.880
[Amit Varma]: While to be a male doctor, you simply had to be born into privilege, basically, right

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.560
[Amit Varma]: time, right place, good things happen, you kind of get there, you could be mediocre.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:55.600
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, in your stories, you know, what you've written in your newsletter is that

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:01.080
[Amit Varma]: time and again, you know, I was reading stories of ordinary women, who on the face of it seem

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:05.720
[Amit Varma]: ordinary, that their lives are ordinary, nothing special about them, you know, normal job karte

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.120
[Amit Varma]: hai, ek do bachche hai, ghar chalate hai, whatever.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:15.280
[Amit Varma]: But then you go into one, you go into the interior lives to a fair extent.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:20.520
[Amit Varma]: And two, you make us realize that their existence isn't so ordinary, that they have so many

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.400
[Amit Varma]: more odds to beat than a comparable male.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:29.480
[Amit Varma]: So just going, you know, circling back to your grandparents, for example, and thinking

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.400
[Amit Varma]: aloud over there, how did they cope?

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.320
[Amit Varma]: And is it that the women coped differently, or coped better?

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:41.520
[Amit Varma]: Or, you know, they could kind of, they carried that burden in a different way?

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.480
[Amit Varma]: Were there different kinds of denial that might have set in for the men or the women?

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.280
[Amit Varma]: Because one common way that I can just think for men to deal with it is a certain kind

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:55.160
[Amit Varma]: of macho denial, you know, and some of that could also, you know, involve just running

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:59.480
[Amit Varma]: away from what just happened, or, you know, not facing up to that.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:04.120
[Amit Varma]: So I'm just sort of, I see this, you know, I'm applying this thread that I've seen go

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.120
[Amit Varma]: through.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:09.240
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, so my question, therefore, is that, now looking back in hindsight, do

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.960
[Amit Varma]: you feel that the women coped with it differently?

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:17.360
[Amit Varma]: Do you feel that some of that toughness also rubbed off on you?

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:22.040
[Amit Varma]: Because even a little thing like, you know, inventing a maasi in Karnal, to kind of get

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:28.040
[Amit Varma]: out, is also a way of fighting back, of saying ki nahi, mai nahi loongi, mujhe jaana hai,

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.440
[Amit Varma]: mujhe karna hai, right?

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.600
[Amit Varma]: Did some of it rub off from there as well?

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.980
[Amit Varma]: So what are your sort of observations on that broad subject?

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:40.480
[Amit Varma]: And how much of it, you know, could you see in this particular instance of your grandparents

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:45.760
[Amit Varma]: and your parents and what they kind of, you know, go through to just to just live their

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.720
[Amit Varma]: lives, like even your mother getting transferred like that, obviously, that boss in Delhi would

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.680
[Amit Varma]: have been some toxic asshole.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:56.680
[Amit Varma]: So you know, so what are your observations now, looking back?

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.680
[Guest]: Two things.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:03.240
[Guest]: One, I obviously come from strong women, which is now clear to me in hindsight, which was

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.920
[Guest]: not a recurring, you know, undercurrent of my life that every day I'm waking up and thinking,

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:13.320
[Guest]: wow, what strong women around me, but I mean, strong women was not even a thing that was

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:18.800
[Guest]: even recognized or let alone celebrated in the time that we grew up in.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:24.560
[Guest]: And I mean, let alone the time before that, humare dada, dadi, nana, nani ke time pe toh,

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.560
[Guest]: it wasn't even a thing.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:32.080
[Guest]: It was just a given that, yes, my dadaji will travel across the country, going to all these

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:38.800
[Guest]: theatres and I imagine having a good circle of friends and to meet in every city and hang

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.800
[Guest]: out with.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:46.040
[Guest]: Meanwhile, my dadi is at home raising these four boys by herself and my dad tells me stories

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:51.040
[Guest]: of how, you know, she would have to take, literally, woh jo movie mein nahi dikhate hain, ke woh

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.920
[Guest]: sahookar ke paas aurat jaati hai, ke anaaj de do thoda sa aur woh bolta hai, ke tumhara

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.960
[Guest]: account settle karo pehle.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:02.000
[Guest]: And then that filmy scenes that they show in purane zawaani ki movies, that's what their

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
[Guest]: life was like.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.400
[Guest]: Like she would, by the time my dadaji would come back from tour and he's not in a salary

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:11.200
[Guest]: job that every month money is coming into the account, so by the time he would come

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.160
[Guest]: back from tour, that's when he would bring the money, but by that time, the stocks in

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:20.480
[Guest]: the house were at zero, ke ghar mein ghee khatam hai, tel khatam hai, chawal khatam hai, dhaan

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.480
[Guest]: khatam hai, sab kuch.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:26.320
[Guest]: So, and we're basically, they are living in debt of all the local sahookars and all.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.880
[Guest]: And so, my grandmother was dealing with all of that.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.280
[Guest]: Then my grandfather would come and settle all the debts and then suddenly they would

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.480
[Guest]: live a very happy life for, until the next tour began.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:41.800
[Guest]: Obviously, a very strong woman who was practically single parenting her children while the husband

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.800
[Guest]: is away.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:47.840
[Guest]: Again, like I said about, talked about my nani giving birth to child after child, losing,

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:53.040
[Guest]: despite losing children, an immense amount of pain, trauma, grief, I can't even imagine

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.520
[Guest]: what all she went through.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:42:00.360
[Guest]: My par nani who lost her husband so young and then goes on to become a school principal

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:07.080
[Guest]: and raise her children by herself, doesn't remarry and is a strong independent woman

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.480
[Guest]: in that sense.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:16.560
[Guest]: My par dadi also was widowed early and she also was like, she raised my dada and his

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.040
[Guest]: sister herself for the most part.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:24.320
[Guest]: These are all, obviously, I come from a stock of strength, of strong women.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:29.000
[Guest]: My mother's life, when I think about it, I think I was a very thankless child when

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.720
[Guest]: I was growing up, as most children are, which is, I guess, understandable, forgivable up

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.520
[Guest]: to a certain age.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:41.120
[Guest]: But I was very thankless in hindsight and I didn't appreciate the life she led, you

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.120
[Guest]: know.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:47.840
[Guest]: She would literally get up at 5am, bachchon ka khana, husband ka khana, dabba office

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:52.720
[Guest]: ka, apna dabba office ka, phir then my dad is waking up later and having his morning

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.840
[Guest]: tea and then bachchon ko subah, mallab I would sleep while brushing my teeth, then I would

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.200
[Guest]: sleep in the loo, then I would sleep in the bathroom.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:05.800
[Guest]: So, she had to come and wake me up 20 times in the morning, within the span of one hour.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:11.160
[Guest]: Again, in hindsight, now I know what a thankless and useless liability of a child I was.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.960
[Guest]: But at the time, it feels like natural, ke haan yeh, toh mummi ka kaam hai, mummi kar

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.960
[Guest]: rahi hain.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.160
[Guest]: But now, when you think about it, she's also a working woman.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:23.360
[Guest]: She's also doing her job, going to office, dealing with colleagues and everything.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:27.880
[Guest]: Then shaam ko ghar aa rahi hain, again raat ko dinner wahegar bana rahe mein lagi hain

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.400
[Guest]: and raat ko 12 baje tak, she's on her feet in the kitchen, helping.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:36.160
[Guest]: We had a bit of domestic help, but it wasn't, I mean, there were still these notions of

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.760
[Guest]: which, in my parents' house, it's still true, ke mummi ke haath ka khaana hi banega.

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:44.880
[Guest]: Toh haan, theek hai, they'll be help, but ultimately, khaana toh mummi ke haath ka banega,

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:49.880
[Guest]: roti hain toh garam-garam hone chahiye, jo utarti-utarti roti, those concepts are still

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.880
[Guest]: there.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:55.360
[Guest]: So, she was living in that reality and, I mean, I don't think she was even feeling

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.760
[Guest]: oppressed or anything.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.320
[Guest]: Again, in that age, these were all accepted as facts of life.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.560
[Guest]: This is how life is.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:07.040
[Guest]: And so, her generation, particularly, I felt was very sandwiched because up until then,

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.040
[Guest]: women were mostly housewives.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:12.600
[Guest]: I mean, not to take credit away from stay-at-home mothers who have an incredibly challenging

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:17.920
[Guest]: life of their own, but this was one generation where women said, no, I also want to work.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:22.560
[Guest]: And society said, okay, go and work, but not at the cost of everything else you were already

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.560
[Guest]: doing.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:28.440
[Guest]: So, in my generation, I am, my work or my womaning or whatever I choose to do with my

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.200
[Guest]: life is the primary thing.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:35.360
[Guest]: And then, my house is still, a lot of it is still on me, but I am not physically standing

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.680
[Guest]: in the kitchen cooking rotis every day.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.400
[Guest]: So, in our generation, we have been offloaded some of that burden, at least the physical

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.400
[Guest]: part.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:48.200
[Guest]: I mean, the workload is still large, but the physical part of that labor is of our generation,

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.080
[Guest]: at least in our social economic band.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.840
[Guest]: So, humare liye, that burden has been reduced.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.400
[Guest]: And one generation above, their burden of going to office was not there.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:02.400
[Guest]: But this generation in the middle, my mom's generation and my mother-in-law's generation

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:08.000
[Guest]: and all of our moms, they had to do this double whammy, bahar jao kaam karne, but you have

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.200
[Guest]: to earn that right back by also not letting anything slip at home.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:16.440
[Guest]: So, you are doing the job of the last generation also and the next generation also and together

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.720
[Guest]: as one person, which is, to me, inhuman.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.800
[Guest]: Like, when I think about it now, I feel like my mom's life, I can never live that life.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.360
[Guest]: It was so hard.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:29.320
[Guest]: And we were thankless at that time about it, but now when I think about it, yes, I do come

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:33.920
[Guest]: from strong women and it's a pity that we did not celebrate this sooner and did not

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:38.680
[Guest]: recognize them and not just celebrate them, but, you know, make their life a little easier

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.680
[Guest]: than it was.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.400
[Guest]: It was much harder than it needed to be.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.560
[Amit Varma]: So, my next question, again, sort of goes back to something you said and, in fact, goes

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:50.600
[Amit Varma]: back to something I used to observe about my father and it kind of made me amused and

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:55.760
[Amit Varma]: simultaneously ashamed at myself for being amused, which is that, you know, and he was,

00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.080
[Amit Varma]: of course, lived a privileged life in the sense IAS officer, all of that.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.280
[Amit Varma]: In his old age, I remember whenever he'd visit me in Bombay, I'd take him to the Marriott

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.560
[Amit Varma]: for breakfast because he loved the buffet spread there and he would eat everything.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.800
[Amit Varma]: He would try every single thing, right?

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.520
[Amit Varma]: If anybody is offering anything for free, he wants it.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.520
[Amit Varma]: And I found it amusing.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:20.040
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, at the same time, the rational explanation for it is that our parents grew

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:25.280
[Amit Varma]: up in times of relative scarcity, you know, kuch bhi aasan nahi tha, you know, there wasn't

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.080
[Amit Varma]: an abundance of anything.

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:32.240
[Amit Varma]: So you valued whatever you've got and you had this culture of never wasting anything,

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:36.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, that old cliche of people are starving in China, so finish what you got, right?

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.360
[Guest]: Somalia.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.360
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.480
[Amit Varma]: And there's a lyric from a John Lennon song also, I forget which one was it, Working Class

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.800
[Amit Varma]: Hero or whatever.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:48.120
[Amit Varma]: So it came from that sort of scarcity mindset, whereas we can take all of that stuff for

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.120
[Amit Varma]: granted.

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.720
[Amit Varma]: And if I'm not finishing my food, I can, you know, I can get all rational and say, arre

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.200
[Amit Varma]: sunk cost fallacy and this and that, we can get into that stuff, right?

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:01.120
[Amit Varma]: And you point out, and this is something that many guests of mine have spoken about with

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:06.920
[Amit Varma]: regard to their parents and their grandparents, that hunger for education, ki education karna

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:07.920
[Amit Varma]: hai.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.360
[Amit Varma]: And their parents were so educated, you know, they kind of instilled that in you as well,

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:17.560
[Amit Varma]: that it meant a big deal, ki class mein topper banna hai, 90 nahi chalega, 95 chahiye, mera

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.840
[Amit Varma]: aadha maa kahan gaya, right?

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.200
[Amit Varma]: And you start caring about this stuff.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:28.680
[Amit Varma]: And I'm again, tying it in with another observation I made recently, where I was at a conference

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:34.120
[Amit Varma]: organized by some investors who are investing in very unconventional ways and people around

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:38.880
[Amit Varma]: the country, and they brought together a whole bunch of entrepreneurs, including people who

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.800
[Amit Varma]: were like 17 and 18.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:46.000
[Amit Varma]: And my observation there was that number one, these young people are mind blowing, they're

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.120
[Amit Varma]: a different level.

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:53.940
[Amit Varma]: But number two, and this is something I strongly believe is that real change in India in any

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:58.640
[Amit Varma]: field, you know, will come from the small towns, it will come from hungry young people

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:03.440
[Amit Varma]: in small towns, because they want it more, they have a better work ethic, and they have

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:07.920
[Amit Varma]: bigger dreams, they're not constrained as much by conventional thinking.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:14.320
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just tying all of this together, and wondering if it is, therefore, that background

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:18.400
[Amit Varma]: at last really plays a big part that if you grow up with a certain kind of scarcity, you

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.000
[Amit Varma]: don't take it for granted.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.800
[Amit Varma]: We don't have a scarcity of information out there, there's an abundance of it.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.400
[Amit Varma]: But we take it for granted by spending all our time on Twitter, and, you know, doing

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.060
[Amit Varma]: other matar ghashti or whatever it is, right?

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.920
[Amit Varma]: We are not taking advantage of that.

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:36.400
[Amit Varma]: If you gave the internet to our parents, I think matlab chaar din mein toh daddy poora

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:42.020
[Amit Varma]: internet pad lete, you know, because that hunger was there, which came from scarcity.

00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:47.680
[Amit Varma]: So what are your sort of thoughts on this, in the sense that you came from a background

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.440
[Amit Varma]: where you didn't take this stuff for granted, right?

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.120
[Amit Varma]: You had to work for it.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:57.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, even when you had one bad year in school, you just, you know, got down to it,

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:02.960
[Amit Varma]: topped the West Zone or whatever you topped the next year, you kind of got it done.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:07.360
[Amit Varma]: So in your observation through your own life, and perhaps even through doing this newsletter,

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:11.040
[Amit Varma]: you've met so many people of varied backgrounds and all of that, how much would you say this

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:16.660
[Amit Varma]: matters that, you know, your background matters, your class matters, all of this really shapes

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:20.600
[Amit Varma]: who you are and what you are like, if you were born in a really rich family, and you

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:25.000
[Amit Varma]: were chilling and doing holidays in Switzerland, I suspect you would have been a very different

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000
[Amit Varma]: person.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so so what are sort of your thoughts on this?

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:33.800
[Amit Varma]: Because you meet and talk to many, many more people than I do, you know, from much more

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:34.800
[Amit Varma]: diverse backgrounds.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.800
[Guest]: I mean, I don't know exactly how to answer that.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:43.360
[Guest]: But my thoughts on generally background is that, yeah, we are all a product of our background,

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:50.560
[Guest]: our experiences, to a very large extent, yes, there is free will and choice in there.

00:49:50.560 --> 00:50:00.200
[Guest]: But there's also a lot of, like I said, when I was talking about our IM batch, 249-27 engineers,

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:05.280
[Guest]: you could see that there is a way of thinking that all of these children have, all of these

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.520
[Guest]: students have as compared to the others.

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:12.320
[Guest]: So even, and you could say we were all from different towns and different backgrounds

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.800
[Guest]: and economically, socially, everywhere.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:20.240
[Guest]: But still, there was a way that we were all conditioned in thinking by virtue of just

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.360
[Guest]: those four years of our education.

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:26.840
[Guest]: So obviously, when you talk about the, your entire life and all the generations that came

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:33.680
[Guest]: before you, it is a, it has an undeniable effect on who you turn out to be as a person.

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:38.240
[Guest]: You know, I mean, one of the things that, one of the reasons I was thinking that this

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:45.880
[Guest]: might be the most intellectually low IQ episode of Seen and the Unseen is because I am a Bollywood

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:46.880
[Guest]: fan, right?

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:51.480
[Guest]: So I am coming with that level of intellectual analysis.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:57.520
[Guest]: So for, I'm sure you've had guests who would be able to quote research papers on this from

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:01.960
[Guest]: international research, white papers and intelligent things like that.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:04.920
[Guest]: But my, mujhe, mere dimaag mein literally when you were talking was coming coffee with

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:05.920
[Guest]: Karan.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:11.960
[Guest]: Because I was thinking of all of these, you know, star kids and the entire nepotism debate

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:16.200
[Guest]: and the star kids that come on that show and Karan Johar himself.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:21.840
[Guest]: You see a very, I mean, I love the show, I watch it as soon as an episode drops, but

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:27.240
[Guest]: it's entertaining to me because also sometimes you see how out of touch with reality people

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.560
[Guest]: can get when they are born into privilege.

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:33.880
[Guest]: And you know, there's also sometimes a lack of, extreme lack of self-awareness.

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:39.480
[Guest]: Like if you read Karan Johar's book, which again can be the lowest IQ show note ever

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:45.420
[Guest]: on Seen and the Unseen, but if you read his book, you'll see like there's so much contradiction

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:50.280
[Guest]: of himself within one paragraph, there is like self-awareness bohot kam.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:55.120
[Guest]: So when you're born in that level of privilege and cushion, it obviously doesn't push you

00:51:55.120 --> 00:52:00.880
[Guest]: to question yourself or your place in society or where you're headed beyond a point.

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:05.440
[Guest]: Now as a parent, actually, that's a real concern that my husband and I have about our child

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.520
[Guest]: because we feel like this child is born in full privilege, right?

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:12.080
[Guest]: Like we had what you could still call a middle class upbringing.

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.480
[Guest]: Now we are not middle class.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:20.400
[Guest]: Now we are maybe top 1% or even 0.1% of society with IIM education and civil services and

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.160
[Guest]: all that privilege background.

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.600
[Guest]: This child, our child is born into privilege.

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.760
[Guest]: How do we give him a taste of reality and, you know, obviously you want comforts for

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.840
[Guest]: your child, but at the same time, you don't want him to be so cushioned that he grows

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:37.080
[Guest]: up in living in a fairy land that has no connection to reality.

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:41.240
[Guest]: We want him to grow up to be a contributive citizen of society.

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.360
[Amit Varma]: So you know, I'm going to, as I tend to do, double click on that as well.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:49.760
[Amit Varma]: But before I do, I just want to point out that, you know, you have written one of the

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.880
[Amit Varma]: great posts about imposter syndrome, on womaning in India.

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:58.320
[Amit Varma]: Aur abhi aap yahaan aake khud keh rahe ho ki, I am so this, I am so that and, you know,

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:03.400
[Amit Varma]: lowering the IQ and all that, this is absolutely, I think, ridiculous.

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:07.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, this is one of those episodes I'm excited for people to listen to because they'll

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.720
[Amit Varma]: discover your wonderful newsletter through it.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:14.080
[Amit Varma]: And the other thing regarding what you said about Mr. Johar's book, which will of course

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:18.360
[Amit Varma]: be in the show notes, is that, you know, having done my course, you will also recall how I

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:22.960
[Amit Varma]: tell all the participants that there should be no hierarchy of books in your head.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.880
[Amit Varma]: That yeh high literature hai aur yeh toh bakwaas hai and all of that.

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.720
[Amit Varma]: I really feel strongly about that.

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.840
[Amit Varma]: I think anything that you enjoy reading, you should read.

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:36.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, you should not be hard on yourself ki yeh toh intellectual log nahi padte hai

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.120
[Unknown]: and all of that.

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:42.480
[Amit Varma]: But apart from that, I'm fascinated by what you just said about like, number one, when

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:47.060
[Amit Varma]: you've through your newsletter, you've also like one of the things we we've discussed

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.520
[Amit Varma]: about it in the past.

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:53.540
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things I like about it is how you infused just the right amount of the personal

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:54.540
[Unknown]: in it.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:54:00.040
[Amit Varma]: So you know, there are your own stories, there is your own life makes it so much more relatable.

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:04.480
[Amit Varma]: And there is also that quality of self reflection, which I really like.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:08.520
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting that you're bringing the self reflection to your parenting by consciously

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:13.480
[Amit Varma]: asking ki, as you just did, that how can we make sure that our kid, even though he's born

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:18.080
[Amit Varma]: to privilege, doesn't pick up, you know, the bad attitude that people born to privilege

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.520
[Amit Varma]: sometimes do have.

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.920
[Amit Varma]: So how have you thought about this in concrete terms?

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:27.800
[Amit Varma]: Like, how is your parenting going to be shaped by this?

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:33.560
[Guest]: So there is a, it's a, there's a lot of insulation that privileged kids grow up in, right?

00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:36.160
[Guest]: Like, so we live in a gated colony.

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:41.400
[Guest]: And there's a slum right behind that colony, but it's hidden from view.

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:46.200
[Guest]: And the residents of the colony, we like to pretend that it doesn't exist.

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:51.240
[Guest]: There's a WhatsApp group of the colony RWA.

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:57.320
[Guest]: And often the topics being discussed there are ki, my cleaning lady is asking for 500

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:00.240
[Guest]: rupees more, how dare they, this is extortion.

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:06.040
[Guest]: And there's so much rage against someone who's coming from a much more underprivileged background

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.040
[Guest]: than you.

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:11.560
[Guest]: And for her, 500 rupees means the world, for you, it's not even a coffee.

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:18.480
[Guest]: So I mean, it's very disturbing to see that level of disconnection with reality and empathy.

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:24.640
[Guest]: So for me, it's very important that my child has that empathy and is, you know, aware of

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.520
[Guest]: what privilege is and is very, very conscious of his own.

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:31.760
[Guest]: I mean, already he's just three and I already have explained the word lucky to him, that

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:37.640
[Guest]: you know, you're lucky because, see, I showed him the other day, a lady on a wheelchair.

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:41.080
[Guest]: And I told him that, see that lady, she's on a chair with wheels.

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.080
[Guest]: So he said, why?

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.440
[Guest]: I said, because she can't walk.

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.760
[Guest]: See how lucky we are, because we can.

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.000
[Guest]: So you know, small things like that.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.140
[Guest]: But I feel even at this early age, I'm talking to him about how lucky he is, because he needs

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:58.640
[Guest]: to be very conscious, especially as a male child that too, and born to such privilege,

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.040
[Guest]: that he needs to be conscious at every step.

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:06.120
[Guest]: One thing I really detest is when people give all of the credit for their achievements to

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.120
[Guest]: themselves.

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:09.240
[Guest]: I am here because of my own hard work.

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:15.200
[Guest]: I mean, for a privileged person to say that, it's very tone deaf and black self-awareness.

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:20.720
[Guest]: Because like, for example, even talking about myself, I am here not today on this great

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:25.880
[Guest]: show of yours, not because of my hard work only, but also because of all of these generations

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:31.640
[Guest]: that came before me, and my parents valued my education, and the kind of upbringing I

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:35.320
[Guest]: had, the kind of experiences I was privileged to have, right.

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:41.700
[Guest]: So if you lose that perspective of the debt that you owe to so many people, many of them

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:46.480
[Guest]: you've never even seen, many of them didn't even live in the same time as you did.

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:50.320
[Guest]: But you, this is all the history behind where you are today.

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.360
[Guest]: And that's important for him to realize, that's one thing.

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:58.640
[Guest]: And the other is also more exposure to the real world, like last week was his birthday,

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:02.240
[Guest]: and we celebrated in a shelter for rescue animals.

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:08.040
[Guest]: So he loved feeding the goat, and feeding the donkey, and feeding the duck, and obviously

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:16.600
[Guest]: little kids love animals, and there's a beautiful shelter called Bhan Yad in Delhi, near Saket.

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:22.840
[Guest]: But I chose to take him there instead of throwing him a lavish poolside party like many of his

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:27.720
[Guest]: peers are already getting, because I thought this keeps him more grounded and in touch

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:28.720
[Guest]: with reality.

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:33.120
[Guest]: He'll be as happy, he's a baby at least right now, he doesn't have any notions of what a

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.320
[Guest]: birthday party should look like.

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:41.240
[Guest]: But these are experiences that I want him to have, and obviously he's still a toddler,

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.760
[Guest]: so you still protect him from many of the harsher realities of life, but as he grows

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:49.280
[Guest]: up, more and more of these realities need to be introduced to him in a way that makes

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.280
[Guest]: him a more empathetic person.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.520
[Guest]: So that's my take on parenting.

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:57.000
[Guest]: I also want to circle back to what you said about imposter syndrome.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.360
[Guest]: So I want to tell you, just to increase the IQ of the show notes that I leave behind,

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:07.320
[Guest]: there is a test by Professor Pauline Chance, who was the person who coined the term imposter

00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.320
[Guest]: syndrome.

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.360
[Guest]: Obviously a woman did it.

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.880
[Guest]: And obviously she did it because she saw other women.

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:16.720
[Guest]: That's how she even arrived at the realization that, is there a problem with the way we are

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:17.720
[Guest]: all seeing ourselves?

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:22.840
[Guest]: So she asked that question thankfully, and she came up with a test to diagnose imposter

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.120
[Guest]: syndrome.

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:28.120
[Guest]: And we can link to that test, and I would urge all your listeners, especially women,

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.120
[Guest]: to take that test.

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:33.840
[Guest]: It's a test on which you score from 0 to 100, and the higher your score, the higher is your

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:34.840
[Guest]: imposter syndrome.

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:38.720
[Guest]: And you'll have questions like, do you often think that you don't deserve to be where you

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:39.720
[Guest]: are?

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:44.920
[Guest]: Like, I am literally right now very, in all honesty, been thinking since you invited me

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.480
[Guest]: that I don't deserve to be on the show.

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.120
[Guest]: Why is he inviting me?

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.120
[Guest]: What will I do here?

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.280
[Guest]: What will I say that will add any value?

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:57.800
[Guest]: This is, I know that maybe at some intellectual level, I know that it's not true, but I'm

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.720
[Guest]: programmed to think that it is the way that it is.

00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:05.280
[Guest]: And I was, while writing this piece on imposter syndrome that you talked about, one of the

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.880
[Guest]: women who I had interviewed for the piece, I told her, hey, do me a favor, just take

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:12.320
[Guest]: this test because I took the test and I knew my score.

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:14.520
[Guest]: And I said, tell me what is your score?

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.520
[Guest]: Because I'm covering your story.

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:19.120
[Guest]: I want to know how much of imposter syndrome do you actually have?

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:24.760
[Guest]: And she said, yeah, I have like, the test says I have like a significant amount of imposter

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:25.760
[Guest]: syndrome.

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.160
[Guest]: My score is 35 out of 100.

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.720
[Guest]: And my score was 88.

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:32.080
[Guest]: So you had much more of it.

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:35.080
[Guest]: My score is 88 out of 100 on imposter syndrome.

00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:40.400
[Guest]: So that's how, that's how badly I have held myself back.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:44.560
[Guest]: So I'm sorry for all of the self-deprecatory things I've said so far.

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.480
[Guest]: And I'm going to continue saying, but it's, it's conditioning.

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:51.360
[Guest]: It's a lot of unlearning that I consciously keep trying to do, but it still comes out

00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.360
[Guest]: at times like these.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:57.360
[Amit Varma]: I had a guest at home, and I forget who it is, maybe Shruti Jagirdar, because she's the

00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:01.640
[Amit Varma]: last person I recorded with at home, or maybe before that, but it was a woman.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:06.160
[Amit Varma]: And that woman before the episodes pointed out something to me, which was very true.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.120
[Amit Varma]: She said that a lot of your great episodes are with women.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.200
[Amit Varma]: And they always start by saying, pata nahi mujhe kyu bulaya hai.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, so the imposter syndrome is really like a woman problem.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.800
[Amit Varma]: And I'm going to now double click on the imposter syndrome.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:25.360
[Amit Varma]: But before doing that, I'm very impressed by the awareness which you bring to your parenting.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.600
[Amit Varma]: And I almost feel like I have a stake in this because I know both you and your husband very

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.600
[Amit Varma]: well.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.880
[Amit Varma]: You've been a good friend for much longer.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.280
[Amit Varma]: But one of the great books of social science of the last century was this book called The

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.420
[Amit Varma]: Nurture Assumption by Judith Rich Harris.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:44.440
[Amit Varma]: And it was very controversial, because it showed with great data and all of that, that

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:49.400
[Amit Varma]: the impression that people have that kids are shaped by their parents a lot is actually

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.680
[Amit Varma]: not true, that the influence that parents have on what their kid turns out to be is

01:00:53.680 --> 01:01:00.320
[Amit Varma]: minuscule and the far greater influences is of their peers, you know, so when you said

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.680
[Amit Varma]: that for, you know, your son's friends are already having pool parties thrown for them

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.440
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, you know, that kind of came to mind, but I hope in your case, you guys

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.240
[Amit Varma]: are influential enough to protect him from that.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.360
[Amit Varma]: And there's a contradictory thought here.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.920
[Amit Varma]: And they're both true in their different domains.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.040
[Amit Varma]: And one is a role of luck.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:24.160
[Amit Varma]: Like one of the things my time as a professional poker player taught me is that we underestimate

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:27.760
[Amit Varma]: the role of luck in our lives, like poker is, of course, a game of skill, but the quantum

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:28.860
[Amit Varma]: of luck is very high.

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:33.280
[Amit Varma]: So you need a huge sample size of events for your skill to express itself.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:37.960
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, in life, and I've written about this quite often, we underestimate the role

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.760
[Amit Varma]: of luck to the extent that exactly what you said happens that good things happen to people,

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:46.480
[Amit Varma]: they give credit for it to themselves, and they allow themselves to get arrogant, and

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.920
[Amit Varma]: bad things happen to people.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.360
[Amit Varma]: And they allow it to affect their self esteem, and they get themselves down and they suffer

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.080
[Amit Varma]: from imposter syndrome, and so on and so forth.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.080
[Amit Varma]: And we should sort of watch out for that and sort of try to be equanimous.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.720
[Amit Varma]: I think this understanding of luck and probability almost takes you into a Buddhist direction

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:08.000
[Amit Varma]: where you're kind of, you know, you leave your emotions out of it and you're equanimous,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:15.240
[Amit Varma]: which is, I guess, a sort of a good way to be and, and I would imagine that these different

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.800
[Amit Varma]: directions you go in when you ignore luck, there's a role of gender to it also, it's

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:23.320
[Amit Varma]: a men who are more likely to look at the good that happens to them and get arrogant and

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:27.160
[Amit Varma]: so women who are more likely to have that confidence gap, you know, there was this great

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:31.680
[Amit Varma]: article in the Atlantic called the confidence gap, which also are linked to which, you know,

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.000
[Amit Varma]: reference to a number of these studies showing that, you know, women will not apply for jobs

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.720
[Amit Varma]: that they absolutely deserve, you know, you in your piece on imposter syndrome, you quoted

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.720
[Amit Varma]: this lady called Archana.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.160
[Amit Varma]: So I'll just quote that bit.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.840
[Amit Varma]: And these are her words, because I think they're very sort of, they're applied to a lot of

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.600
[Amit Varma]: people where, you know, a global role was advertised in her company.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.720
[Amit Varma]: And she said, quote, even though the whole world was telling me to apply for it, I wasn't

01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.880
[Amit Varma]: sure I was ready.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.800
[Amit Varma]: It was my classic, I'm getting it because I'm a woman logic.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.720
[Amit Varma]: I didn't want people to question why was I given this role.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.120
[Amit Varma]: So I ended up not applying for it at all.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:12.400
[Amit Varma]: When the position was finally filled, I was shocked to discover that a man who had far

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.840
[Amit Varma]: less relevant experience in me had been selected for it.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.640
[Amit Varma]: The HR leader later told me in confidence that out of the pool of candidates ever considering

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:25.480
[Amit Varma]: for the position, I was the only one who everybody unanimously thought could do the job.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:31.360
[Amit Varma]: And you've got sort of other examples of this as well, including people like Maya Angelou

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:37.200
[Amit Varma]: once saying, quote, I have written 11 books, but each time I think, oh, they're going to

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.200
[Amit Varma]: find out now.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.840
[Amit Varma]: I've run a game on everybody and they're going to find me out, stop quote, and Einstein says

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.120
[Amit Varma]: a similar thing.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:47.800
[Amit Varma]: And this is also known in psychology as a Dunning-Kruger effect, right?

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.400
[Amit Varma]: That I mean, there are two sides to the Dunning-Kruger effect.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:54.680
[Amit Varma]: One side is, you know, people tend to think they are better at something than they actually

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.680
[Amit Varma]: are.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example, Lake Wobegon is a famous example of that.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.280
[Amit Varma]: Lake Wobegon is a fictional town created by the novelist Garrison Keillor, where everybody

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.080
[Amit Varma]: thinks they're better than average, which can obviously not be the case, right?

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.080
[Guest]: It's an island of men.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.080
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.080
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, it's a very man thing, right?

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.760
[Amit Varma]: And so there's a term for it called the Lake Wobegon effect, where everybody thinks they're

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.760
[Amit Varma]: better than average.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.640
[Amit Varma]: So every driver will tell you he's a better driver than average, though obviously it's

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640
[Amit Varma]: not true.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:25.760
[Amit Varma]: And in this case, I'm using the male pronoun deliberately, you know, but the converse of

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:31.720
[Amit Varma]: that is that people who are experts will often downplay their expertise because it is so

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:36.960
[Amit Varma]: easy to them that they will think what is a big deal, anyone can do it, which in a sense,

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.600
[Amit Varma]: I think you're also doing because what you've done with this newsletter, writing 70 something

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.960
[Amit Varma]: posts week after week, week after week.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.160
[Amit Varma]: It's a stunning act of discipline.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.160
[Amit Varma]: And you know, it's it's so consistent and it's so consistently good and you're completely

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.640
[Amit Varma]: underplaying that like it's easy, which anyone can tell you it's not.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:05:02.680
[Guest]: So, you know, you said your score was 85, 88, 88, which means very high imposter syndrome,

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.320
[Guest]: almost reached my 95 target.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:13.520
[Amit Varma]: So how do you fight this in yourself?

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:18.680
[Amit Varma]: Because if you're saying it was 88, it was 88 after you knew that there is such a thing.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.680
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.760
[Guest]: You knew there was a trap, but you still fell into it.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.760
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.400
[Guest]: So I was literally writing a piece on it.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.360
[Guest]: I was researching it for my piece.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:33.920
[Guest]: I was interviewing women and beating them, why did you belittle your own accomplishments,

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.520
[Guest]: your achievements, your capacity so much?

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.160
[Guest]: Why do you think so little of yourself?

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:45.440
[Guest]: And then I took the test myself in all consciousness that this test is designed to highlight this.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:49.320
[Guest]: But then I tried to be as honest as I could and I thought back to actual decisions I've

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:54.000
[Guest]: taken in my life and how I thought about myself, my abilities, potentials, when I took those

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.840
[Guest]: decisions, how I felt when I was given an honor, how I felt when I met with failure.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:04.680
[Guest]: And I wrote it in all honesty and I thought, yes, I will get a good high score, but this

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:09.240
[Guest]: was like beyond my wildest imagination that it's really bad.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.240
[Amit Varma]: Has it changed you?

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.240
[Amit Varma]: In the sense that do you now tell yourself to watch out for it?

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:17.720
[Amit Varma]: Do you stop holding yourself back from doing whatever you want to do?

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:18.720
[Guest]: I do.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.720
[Guest]: Two things have changed.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:23.440
[Guest]: One, which is something I've written in the piece, is about compliments.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:28.640
[Guest]: When people tell me that you've been showering me with these kind compliments about the work

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.640
[Guest]: I've done.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:35.520
[Guest]: Like my earlier pre-writing womaning, my instinct was to deny and argue back and no, no, Amit,

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.800
[Guest]: this is not true.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:41.120
[Guest]: Anyone can write it and see so many people write newsletters and sub-stack numbers, dekho

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.760
[Guest]: kitte writers hai ye wo.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.480
[Guest]: I would have argued back.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:51.040
[Guest]: Now I hold that argument, it's still in my mind, but I force myself to say thank you.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.120
[Guest]: That's for me big.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:58.040
[Guest]: I know it sounds very normal and what's the big deal in it, but I suppose women and even

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:02.360
[Guest]: men who suffer from severe crippling imposter syndrome will realize that that's a big step

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.440
[Guest]: to just graciously accept a compliment.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:11.000
[Guest]: That's one change that I have forced myself, I've consciously made and succeeded in making

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.920
[Guest]: happen.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:20.960
[Guest]: And the second was about how after you said, are you able to go for things?

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:27.120
[Guest]: That has happened a lot more after motherhood because I feel like motherhood kind of is

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:30.640
[Guest]: a transformative experience, that's an understatement for sure.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:36.160
[Guest]: But also for me at least, it gave me the perspective of how little things matter that we think

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.760
[Guest]: so much about.

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:43.880
[Guest]: And when you become responsible for another human life is when you feel that everything

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.860
[Guest]: else I worry about was so inconsequential.

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:51.720
[Guest]: After becoming a mother, when people would talk to me about mera boss, mera deadline,

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:57.160
[Guest]: mera office, I'd be like, yeh kya begar cheezon pe log tension le rahe hain.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:03.080
[Guest]: My own things that would hold me back, which would seem like big things in the past, now

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:11.120
[Guest]: I've become a lot more pragmatic about it and you know, universe is very large, life

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.960
[Guest]: is very long, we are a speck in the universe, it doesn't really matter whether I come on

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.520
[Guest]: a podcast or what be in the larger scheme of things.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:24.520
[Guest]: So let me accept if a friend is inviting me and I know I might feel this primal urge that

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.600
[Guest]: I don't deserve to be here, but forget it, it's okay.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.400
[Guest]: Plenty of undeserving people get what they don't deserve.

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:34.100
[Guest]: Maybe I do deserve it, maybe I don't, either way it doesn't matter in the larger scheme

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.100
[Guest]: of things.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.860
[Guest]: So that kind of attitude of doesn't really matter in the larger scheme of things and

01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:44.280
[Guest]: what really matters is I am responsible for a life, for an individual and that is going

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.720
[Guest]: to be probably my biggest contribution.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:51.920
[Guest]: That kind of also gives you a lot more grounding and you tend to be more, for me at least it

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.280
[Guest]: has made me more adventurous in the decisions I take.

01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:01.960
[Amit Varma]: In your experience, how important are circles of female solidarity and female friendship

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:02.960
[Amit Varma]: in all this?

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.920
[Amit Varma]: Because my assumption is that if people are chronically underconfident, then it really

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.360
[Amit Varma]: helps if somebody tells you, no, you're so good, you are the expert in this, you deserve

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.840
[Amit Varma]: this, you go for it.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.200
[Amit Varma]: And men don't tell women that, right?

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.400
[Unknown]: Men take women in their lives for granted.

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:22.680
[Amit Varma]: Even for all the care work that women do, for example, men won't express it, you know,

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:26.600
[Amit Varma]: the food is great, or, you know, thank you for this or whatever, they kind of take it

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.600
[Amit Varma]: for granted.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.880
[Amit Varma]: So it therefore at one level, and this is something, you know, I didn't recorded an

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.800
[Amit Varma]: episode yesterday with Alice Evans, and she was also speaking about this through countries

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:42.840
[Amit Varma]: that these networks and become really important networks of female solidarity and friendship.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:47.960
[Amit Varma]: And one way in which it strikes me that it certainly would, it's just in terms of giving

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.160
[Amit Varma]: each other courage, and helping you beat this confidence gap.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:10:00.080
[Guest]: Yeah, so that has been a learning over decades for me, because, like I said, I was a full

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:06.480
[Guest]: on misogynist when I was young, as I'm in love school, I was like a proper tomboy, I've

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.480
[Guest]: written about this also.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:18.800
[Guest]: So that that was my ethos also, and it was like a very common undercurrent of the average

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:26.560
[Guest]: young psyche in that in the 90s, that, you know, girls are stupid, they talk about fashion

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.560
[Guest]: and they are always gossiping and I'm above all that.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:36.200
[Guest]: And so I was I genuinely had more male friends in school, because I used to look down upon

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:40.600
[Guest]: women and friendships with women, and I used to think that women are a lot, there's a lot

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:44.280
[Guest]: of politics, there's backstabbing, there's all this stuff happening, which is too much

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.280
[Guest]: to take.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:49.880
[Guest]: Men are simpler, and boys have nothing going on in their brains beyond what they are doing

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.240
[Guest]: at that moment, easier to deal with them.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:57.840
[Guest]: And I used to genuinely feel that male friendships are better and stronger, because I would see

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:04.440
[Guest]: them lasting over years, right, like our fathers would still be friends with their childhood

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.840
[Guest]: male friends, but our mothers, you would never hear of ke meri school mein wo friend thi,

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.800
[Guest]: meri college mein wo friend thi.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.840
[Guest]: Now later in life, I realized that that was also a privilege that men had, right, to stay

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.240
[Guest]: in touch with their peers and their friends.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:21.360
[Guest]: And women were often married off into separate families, surname change, often name also

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:26.120
[Guest]: change in the absence of a social network, how will they even stay in touch?

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:30.520
[Guest]: And they are so busy with everyday life, like I've told you my mom's daily routine, where

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.040
[Guest]: is the space in that for friendships?

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.480
[Guest]: So all of those were things that I didn't see at that time, and I had these notions

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.600
[Guest]: about male friendships versus female friendships.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:45.280
[Guest]: But over the years, I have realized that it's actually the other way around.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:52.400
[Guest]: Female friendships, when with the right people who are, you know, who have that realization

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:57.320
[Guest]: of how the world is designed to hold us back, and we are on our own, we have to build each

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.320
[Guest]: other up.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:03.200
[Guest]: And when you have that kind of a positive female friendship, it can be the best thing

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.840
[Guest]: that you do in your life, just talking to that friend.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:09.600
[Guest]: And like I told you, I used to beat up other women, ke tum kyu apne baar mein itna chota

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.600
[Guest]: soch ro?

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:16.280
[Guest]: And I would not say that to myself ever, because I am thinking, myself thinking less of myself.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:21.400
[Guest]: So then my friend will come and beat me on that, ke yaar tum kyu apne baar mein aisa

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.400
[Guest]: soch ro?

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:26.880
[Guest]: So I mean, the standard trope is talk to yourself the way you would talk to your best friend.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:31.320
[Guest]: But we are not able to do that because we are, as you quoted from the post, we are conditioned

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.760
[Guest]: not to do that.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:38.040
[Guest]: So that's why I think in that context, female friendships, especially with women who have

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.120
[Guest]: that perspective of building each other up, that sort of a female friendship can just

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.880
[Guest]: be a huge, huge boost and support in your life.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.640
[Guest]: And you also have these shared experiences.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:51.520
[Guest]: So that was the whole reason I started writing Womaning when I realized that many things

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.720
[Guest]: I was experiencing were not unique to me.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:57.720
[Guest]: Because up until then, I thought ye mere saath hi ho raha hai, jo ho raha hai.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:03.240
[Guest]: And because I have this great, unique trajectory in life that all of the things that I've done,

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:08.240
[Guest]: which half of them we covered and my career to bhi start bhi nahi hua hai, all of that,

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.360
[Guest]: which I've done, that is the reason why I am having these experiences at work, with

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.360
[Guest]: the family and everything.

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:17.400
[Guest]: But then when you start talking to other women, you realize that a lot of these are shared

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:23.040
[Guest]: experiences and a lot of them are not because I am who I am, but because I'm a woman.

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.760
[Guest]: And when you see that undercurrent and that thread, that's the whole reason I started

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:27.760
[Guest]: writing Womaning.

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.640
[Guest]: Because I was like, this thread needs to be made more obvious to men and women both.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.120
[Guest]: Because women need to realize that my challenges are not unique to me.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:39.440
[Guest]: And they are not something that's happening to me because of something I did.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.520
[Guest]: I don't deserve this.

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.800
[Guest]: This is a gender wide thing.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.240
[Guest]: And men need to realize, be more conscious of them for obvious reasons too.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:51.640
[Amit Varma]: And one point you kind of made here is worth underscoring, which is about, you know, men

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.400
[Amit Varma]: staying in touch, women not staying in touch, but that's because women get so fundamentally

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.240
[Amit Varma]: uprooted in our country so often during marriage.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.640
[Amit Varma]: Like one of the finest books I've read in the last decade is called India Moving by

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.920
[Unknown]: Chinmay Tumbe.

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:06.980
[Amit Varma]: And it's about the history of internal migration in India.

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:11.640
[Amit Varma]: And the big TIL there is that most internal migration happens in India because a woman

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:15.380
[Amit Varma]: gets married, and she's leaving a home and she's going somewhere else.

01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:16.600
[Amit Varma]: And it is a complete uprooting.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:20.520
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes, of course, it's a different city, different state, but even if it is not, it's

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:24.120
[Amit Varma]: a different milieu, it's a different house, it's different expectations.

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:28.840
[Amit Varma]: It's almost like you've gone from, you know, one oppressive environment to another, no

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:33.720
[Guest]: matter how much you change your name changes, so you're just a whole different person.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:39.040
[Guest]: The person who existed one week back before your marriage doesn't exist anymore, your

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.160
[Guest]: entire existence is wiped off.

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.440
[Guest]: So I mean, how do you expect your friendships telling you could be an identity?

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, let's go back to your childhood and we'll do your full biography.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:56.560
[Guest]: Don't worry, I thought I was actually talking too much, I don't want to break records.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.160
[Amit Varma]: No one can talk too much for the same reason that no one is boring.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, all lives are so fascinating.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.200
[Amit Varma]: Earlier, you know, while talking about your childhood, you mentioned and just now again,

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:11.440
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned that you weren't aware of these undercurrents of misogyny for a long time,

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.880
[Amit Varma]: that your mother would do all of this.

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And you would say, she's got to wake me up five times, you know, even though she's got

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.640
[Amit Varma]: so much going on.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:24.280
[Amit Varma]: And equally in college, you said that, again, you weren't aware of this, tell me about that

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.840
[Amit Varma]: process of awareness, like, how did you start becoming aware?

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:30.000
[Amit Varma]: One, how did you start becoming aware?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.640
[Amit Varma]: And two, how did you then start putting a frame to it?

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:40.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, this is the way the world is and, you know, figuring out how to think about

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:46.160
[Amit Varma]: it in terms of, you know, whether it's a certain kind of feminist thinker or writer who began

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:51.200
[Amit Varma]: to influence you first, how did that evolution sort of happen in your own life?

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:56.120
[Guest]: This is a black box for me to I've thought about this a lot often, when was that time?

01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:02.840
[Guest]: Is there any one moment in which I suddenly had a coin dropping moment, oh, this is how

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.000
[Guest]: the world is.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.080
[Guest]: And now I see everything from that lens, like, people close to me accuse me, you're like,

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:13.360
[Guest]: you know, with a person with a hammer to whom everything is a nail now, that's how you are

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.360
[Guest]: with gender.

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:20.360
[Guest]: And that's I am guilty of that to some extent, but it is so overarching and every and just

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:27.000
[Guest]: omnipresent this this lens, but I don't know a particular moment, I, I think the explanation

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.600
[Guest]: I have come to is that it was I was just a part of a larger cultural shift that happened

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:40.680
[Guest]: at some point in the 2000s and early 2010s, which is that we started recognizing some

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:48.160
[Guest]: of these things that we had taken, accepted at face value, to be not the way the world

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.160
[Guest]: necessarily should be.

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.760
[Guest]: And there's something wrong here.

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:57.040
[Guest]: So I think Mrinalji spoke about this on during her, her interview with you.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:02.240
[Guest]: And she said that, aisa lagta tha ke kuch galat ho raha hai, par pata nahi tha kya hai.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.880
[Guest]: So I had that feeling my entire childhood, ke even though, like I said, I was a misogynist

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.520
[Guest]: myself, and I was guilty of all of these tropes, believing them, following them, propagating

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:12.520
[Guest]: them.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.720
[Guest]: But I also had this nagging feeling, especially because I grew up with a brother, right.

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:23.320
[Guest]: So I would see very stark differences in the way everybody and the world treated him, not

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:32.600
[Guest]: just my family, but the institutions around us, the society, public spaces, friends, everything.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:37.200
[Guest]: And this difference became much more stark as we grew older, because as kids, you're

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:43.040
[Guest]: still, I mean, at least, credit to my parents, they never did any discrimination, ke ladki

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.840
[Guest]: hai toh isko do roti kam di jayenge, that didn't happen in my house at all.

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:51.680
[Guest]: It was the other way around, badla, I think I was quite pampered by my dad.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:58.400
[Guest]: But there was a difference, ke haan, tum iti zor se mat haso, aise ladkiya nahi hasti hain.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:03.560
[Guest]: Aur you know, I remember one memory of hum gayi, bus mein kahin ja rahe the and I stood

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:08.560
[Guest]: up and immediately I was told ke baith jao, peeche wale sab dekhenge, ladkiya aise khadi

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.560
[Guest]: nahi hoti hain.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:15.840
[Guest]: And it was, for me, it was such a weird thing, ke ladkiya ka kya hai isme khade hone, I just

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:21.200
[Guest]: want to stretch, I'm standing, but then suddenly it is, there is a new lens that you're introduced

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.080
[Guest]: to, that this is the way the world is going to see you, and so you better not cross the

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.080
[Guest]: line there.

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:31.520
[Guest]: So those faint lines started becoming more clear as I grew older.

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:36.480
[Guest]: When we went to college, suddenly, like I said, I always had more male friends than

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.200
[Guest]: female friends all through school.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:42.480
[Guest]: But suddenly there was a different lens with which my male friendships were seen when I,

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:45.480
[Guest]: once I entered college, because there were a lot of romantic relationships happening

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.160
[Guest]: in batch mates and all.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.880
[Guest]: So my mom always used to call me, koi hai kya, kaun hai, kya hai.

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:55.040
[Guest]: And if I mention a boy's name in passing, then suddenly she wants to double click on

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:59.760
[Guest]: that, as you say, let's double click, ladke ka naam.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:02.080
[Guest]: So I mean, those things never happened with my brother.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:09.280
[Guest]: So going out with friends, something simple for him, very, a thing that he didn't have

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:10.800
[Guest]: to think about twice, I had to.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.600
[Guest]: I had to think about the way I would formulate that application to my parents, is tarah se

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:20.840
[Guest]: bolenge saath mein yeh jaa rahi hai, woh jaa rahi hai, toh itne baje wapas aayenge, yeh

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.240
[Guest]: mode of transport hai.

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.120
[Guest]: So and even beyond that, like sometimes I wouldn't even bother because I would in my

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.080
[Guest]: mind be like, yeh toh is not outside the realm of possibility for me.

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:34.000
[Guest]: Ek Kurukshetra se Shimla ki trip ban rahi hai, friends ki, bhool jao.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.040
[Guest]: I'm sorry, I'm out even before I ask anybody else.

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.800
[Guest]: I know this is not within my realm of possibilities.

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:45.920
[Guest]: So there were things like this, which, especially between me and my brother, because that was

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:51.680
[Guest]: one male figure that I had seen my whole life and us being treated the same our whole life.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.220
[Guest]: And then suddenly now us being treated differently.

01:19:54.220 --> 01:20:00.160
[Guest]: So I think that niggling thing behind my mind of kuch galat hai, started becoming more and

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:04.400
[Guest]: more concrete with age, kuch zyada hi galat hai.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:09.640
[Guest]: And then over time, I think culturally also, like I said, our society, the F word feminism

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:16.160
[Guest]: was introduced, movies mein thoda dikhne laga, ke haan, woh ladkiyan jo, peeche showpiece

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:20.920
[Guest]: hoti thi aur ek woh bachao bachao bachao victim hogi hai, heroa kaise bacha lega, that's,

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.480
[Guest]: aur ek gaane mein dance kar degi.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:27.920
[Guest]: So that's the extent of female representation we saw in pop culture, that began to be questioned

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:31.240
[Guest]: and there were movies that shifted the narrative.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:34.280
[Guest]: So slowly, I think culturally also, the environment was conducive.

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.600
[Guest]: And that's how it was a very, very gradual process.

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:41.280
[Guest]: So I cannot think of any one trigger that led to it.

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:46.480
[Amit Varma]: And what was your conception of yourself through this period, in the sense ki pehle toh apne

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:51.360
[Amit Varma]: engineering kar liya, after topping class, uske baad MBA kar liya, but, you know, are

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.640
[Amit Varma]: you kind of going with the flow and because you're always excelling in academics, you're

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:59.920
[Amit Varma]: just taking the most obvious next step that everybody takes, kyunki 12th ke baad toh engineering

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:04.680
[Amit Varma]: hi main option hoti hai, uske baad MBA is such a great option, you got into IIM Bangalore

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.840
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:08.920
[Amit Varma]: But you know, was, were you sort of going with that flow?

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:12.680
[Amit Varma]: Or was there a plan that, or did you think about it and think about, you know, these

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:16.040
[Amit Varma]: are the things I'm interested in, these are the things I want to do, this is the kind

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.600
[Amit Varma]: of life I want to live.

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:22.360
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about that sort of evolution in your thinking and your understanding of yourself.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:27.160
[Guest]: Yeah, so, at least in the early stages, there was zero thought.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:31.400
[Guest]: The only thought I have, which I've mentioned before, is the ethic of my parents have worked

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.280
[Guest]: very hard to give me an education.

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.440
[Guest]: And so I have one job in life, everything else is provided for me, I have one job, which

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.440
[Guest]: is to study.

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:44.760
[Guest]: So I'm going to do it well, because this is the least I can do to justify my parents efforts

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.080
[Guest]: and sacrifices.

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.880
[Guest]: So that kind of sailed me through school.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:53.120
[Guest]: And like you said, uske baad, doctor engineer do options hoti hain, bio mujhe pasand nahi

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:57.840
[Guest]: aati si toh, ho gaya, physics, chemistry, maths, chalo, engineer.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:04.840
[Guest]: Uske baad bhi, it was, again, MBA was a very obvious and aspirational route for everyone.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.960
[Guest]: I did get a job, but I also got MBA.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:10.200
[Guest]: So nahi hota toh job kar lete, ho gaya toh kar liya.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:17.600
[Guest]: Again it was a very, going with the flow decision, which is just popular wisdom, parents' wisdom,

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.400
[Guest]: sab log yeh kar rahe hain, achi cheez hai, karo.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.800
[Guest]: Even the choice of my branch, electronics and communication, I had no particular love

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:30.000
[Guest]: for that direction, nor do I even today, but sadly.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.880
[Guest]: But that was just a very natural decision, ke best hoti hain, electronics aur computer

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.240
[Guest]: science do best hain, unmein se ek le lo.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.760
[Guest]: Toh jo mil jayega, achche college mein le liya.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:41.480
[Guest]: It was not a very conscious decision on my part.

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:46.800
[Guest]: I think the step where I started thoda sa taking conscious decisions was around the

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:50.160
[Guest]: end of MBA, when the kind of job I went for.

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:56.560
[Guest]: But until that point, it was following the flow, and that said, to this day, I tell people,

01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:02.680
[Guest]: because when you look back at my CV, it looks very, waah kya, bahot decisive steps have

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:05.000
[Guest]: been taken at various junctures.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:11.000
[Guest]: But when people ask me for guidance, I'm like, dekho, for me, I don't, even today, I don't

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
[Guest]: have a plan for this is what I want to do with my life.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.440
[Guest]: But for me, what has always worked is that the next step has been somehow clear to me.

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:21.180
[Guest]: That either it has been, this is what I don't want to do.

01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:25.240
[Guest]: So yeh mujhe nahi karna hai, toh therefore the other alternative is jo mujhe karna hai.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:28.080
[Guest]: Or it is that this is one thing that I really want.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.880
[Guest]: Like womaning was something that was not a push from anywhere, it was a pull from inside

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:32.880
[Guest]: me.

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:33.960
[Guest]: It was literally something that was bursting to come out.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.800
[Guest]: So that was a decision made that way.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.200
[Guest]: But it was only the first step that was clear to me.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:43.820
[Guest]: Even that, until your course, as we'll discuss later, when you shifted it in my mind from

01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:46.480
[Guest]: a book to a newsletter, until that time, even that wasn't clear.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:51.160
[Guest]: So always it's been the first step, or rather the next step that has been clear to me.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.640
[Guest]: Beyond that, I can't see the road where it is going.

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:58.600
[Guest]: But that much clarity and just the courage to take that step, which often, that itself

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:04.160
[Guest]: is something denied to women and to a person who comes from a certain comfort, ab toh I

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:07.920
[Guest]: am bagaira sab ho gaya, ab kaun chhod ke jate hain itni high paying job into government.

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.820
[Guest]: So things like that, there are obstacles even in that taking one step.

01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:15.840
[Guest]: So those, those I have managed to overcome and those have been decisive steps.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:20.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, during the writing course, I like quoting the novelist Riyal Doctoro, who when speaking

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.360
[Amit Varma]: of writing a book says, it's okay to drive by the headlights.

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.600
[Guest]: You know, you can make the whole journey that way.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:32.120
[Amit Varma]: And I think that's sort of my philosophy to life as well, or at least my express philosophy,

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.760
[Amit Varma]: because I don't actually live it myself.

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.520
[Amit Varma]: And I don't really lead by example.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:40.320
[Amit Varma]: But the philosophy being have a bias for action, you know, don't try to plan everything out

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.280
[Amit Varma]: in your head ki pehle yeh hoga, phir wo hoga, phir wo hoga.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:48.920
[Amit Varma]: Just have a bias for action, just go out there, do something, you know, just just keep at

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.320
[Amit Varma]: it, just keep doing stuff.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.080
[Amit Varma]: And I think that's what you've sort of done so well.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.480
[Amit Varma]: So when you sent me a note about the kind of things you could talk about, I noticed

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:02.280
[Amit Varma]: these two were really interesting bullet points, which are life lessons from engineering in

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:06.520
[Amit Varma]: the Haryana hinterlands, and life lessons from IIM Bangalore.

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.280
[Amit Varma]: So we've kind of spoken about both of these places in general.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:17.600
[Amit Varma]: But I'm intrigued by the term you use life lessons, like, how would you kind of sum it

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:21.720
[Amit Varma]: up in terms of what were your life lessons from these two places, and perhaps your lessons

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.720
[Amit Varma]: about yourself?

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:28.000
[Guest]: Yeah, so I think both of these places shaped me, I mean, rather than taking away a lesson

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.320
[Guest]: outside of me, it was things that change inside me.

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:38.520
[Guest]: So like I said, academically coming from a very strong background, I was very confident

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.520
[Guest]: about those aspects.

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:43.560
[Guest]: But I think my personality as a whole had not developed and to some extent, it is also

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:48.440
[Guest]: because 9 to 12 tak cable TV bandh aur khelna bandh aur padh ke padhai karo, right.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.680
[Guest]: So that makes your personality a bit unidimensional, of course.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:56.880
[Guest]: So that I think I really came into my own and I blossomed in Kurukshetra, despite all

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.040
[Guest]: the forces that impeded a woman from doing that on that campus.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:06.600
[Guest]: But I did, I kind of developed a lot more confidence in my abilities and organizational

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:12.720
[Guest]: abilities, managerial abilities, the leadership abilities, things that I could pull together,

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:19.320
[Guest]: juniors of college, inspire them and motivate them to achieve a goal, organize a festival

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.660
[Guest]: or whatever it was, publish a magazine.

01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:26.160
[Guest]: So I think for me, Kurukshetra, the biggest thing I learned from engineering was not engineering,

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.280
[Guest]: but it was this stuff.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:30.920
[Guest]: So for me, it was a personality development course, plus plus.

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:31.920
[Guest]: That was my engineering.

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:35.700
[Guest]: So that was the, not a lesson, but the way it changed me.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:40.400
[Guest]: And then I think in IIM, there was a lot of humility that came with it, because like I

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.840
[Guest]: said, patthar feko, topar palal ko lagayega.

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.200
[Guest]: So that is the environment you are in.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:49.240
[Guest]: And I remember in Ahmedabad, we used to actually live behind IIM Ahmedabad campus.

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:54.760
[Guest]: And we were like young students aur aise afwaa hoti thi ki pata hai IIM ke bachche raat ko

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.800
[Guest]: do ghanta sote hain, pata hai wo kitna padhai karte hain.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:03.360
[Guest]: And then suddenly, I am on that side and I am like, mereko toh needh aati hai, main kaise

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.360
[Guest]: karoon.

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:09.000
[Guest]: So, and then you genuinely see these people who are way above average, like they are another

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
[Guest]: breed.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.440
[Guest]: The amount of discipline they have, the kind of academic drive in them.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:19.560
[Guest]: And then you realize that, oh, I have always thought of myself as an academically accomplished

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:22.000
[Guest]: person, but I actually don't share this drive.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.120
[Guest]: So there were things that to be inspired from, there were also a lot of lessons of what not

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:27.200
[Guest]: to do with life.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:32.480
[Guest]: So there's a lot of, and I'm sure my IIM peers who might be listening will agree with some

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.480
[Guest]: parts of this.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:40.320
[Guest]: There's a lot of cutthroat competition, materialism, a lot of, life is a zero-sum game.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:46.000
[Guest]: That's a huge thing that's kind of drilled into you by the IIM culture, that there is

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.280
[Guest]: a campus mein bolte the something called RG Giri.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.400
[Guest]: So there's a, RG is relative grading.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:56.480
[Guest]: So that's a system where you and I write one exam, you score higher than me, that effectively

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.480
[Guest]: lowers my score.

01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:01.080
[Guest]: So it's not just that you got 10 on 10 and I got 9 on 10.

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.920
[Guest]: It's also that my 9 becomes 8.5 because you got 10.

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:04.920
[Guest]: It's like that.

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:09.680
[Guest]: So, I mean, suppose you, so the higher you score as my peer, the worse it is for me.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:14.400
[Amit Varma]: That feels like such a toxic system because when you're not trying to become good, you're

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:18.880
[Amit Varma]: trying to be better than others, which is just sounds so ugly to me.

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:19.880
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:23.400
[Guest]: And it also, it also initiates this crab mentality, right?

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:25.820
[Guest]: Like your welfare is worse for me.

01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.840
[Guest]: So our incentives are aligned so that I want you to do worse in life.

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:30.120
[Guest]: I want to pull you down.

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.640
[Guest]: If I see you succeeding, I want to put hurdles in your path.

01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:38.880
[Guest]: So it also kind of conditions you in a very toxic kind of mindset.

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:43.760
[Guest]: I was luckily never able to learn any of those tricks, but I did see a lot of that.

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:48.160
[Guest]: Like it was, it was sometimes tragic to the extent that people had imbibed these values

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:54.800
[Guest]: and were able to live them like, um, I don't know if this will be worth airing, but there

01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.480
[Guest]: was a story that comes to mind, which is there was this group of topper guys, okay?

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:04.480
[Guest]: There would be class projects and as they used to say, project group of five, there

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:09.960
[Guest]: would be these guys who will make eye contact across the classroom and they would form a

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:10.960
[Guest]: group in half a second.

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.640
[Guest]: That we are toppers, we are going to stick together because our group will do the best

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:20.560
[Guest]: and then therefore our Jigiri, the others will do worse off and we'll be the best.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:23.800
[Guest]: Fine to make groups with your friends, but there was a lens to it.

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:25.800
[Guest]: It was not a lens of compatibility or friendship.

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.640
[Guest]: It was a lens of success.

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:29.920
[Guest]: Who is going to help me succeed the most?

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:34.760
[Guest]: And then there were these students who would inevitably always be left behind at the end

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:39.360
[Guest]: and who would not be accepted in any of the groups and it was often very heartbreaking.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:44.040
[Guest]: They would send emails later on the class group, ke koi group mein jaga hai, kya I am

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:48.440
[Guest]: still looking and it was always the same kids, same students.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:55.440
[Guest]: I remember there was one classmate, batchmate, he was differently abled and he was always

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.120
[Guest]: one of the last to be picked.

01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:02.080
[Guest]: And then I remember one course we had was business law and in which it was all about

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:07.360
[Guest]: legal stuff and I used to doze off the second that professor would start talking, but usme

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.360
[Guest]: yeh hi hua.

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:12.640
[Guest]: Group bana, the professor said, groups of X and immediately this, I was sitting right

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:17.060
[Guest]: behind one of the topper kids, jinka eye contact mein group ban jata tha.

01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:24.960
[Guest]: And that guy turns to his fellow topper guy and he says ki is group mein usko lete hain.

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:30.520
[Guest]: The student who was always left behind because woh barrister tha pehle, toh isme hume uske

01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:32.200
[Guest]: hone se advantage hoga.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:37.960
[Guest]: And I just felt so evil at that time, I was like ki yaar, this is one guy you systemically

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:39.760
[Guest]: always leave behind.

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:42.760
[Guest]: Even I am guilty of it to some extent because I am making friends with my, groups with my

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:48.280
[Guest]: friends and this guy is being left behind by all of us as a group every time, year after

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:51.200
[Guest]: year, subject after subject, class after class.

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:55.880
[Guest]: And this one time because he is useful to you, you immediately want to go get him first

01:30:55.880 --> 01:31:00.920
[Guest]: because you know that you all are IITians and you don't have that legal background.

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:05.960
[Guest]: So for me it was very, these were lessons of what not to do with life also.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:11.520
[Guest]: I mean and I remember a few years later I met a batchmate who was a good friend on campus

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:16.580
[Guest]: and many of my batchmates have gone on to do extremely well for themselves and a lot

01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:23.080
[Guest]: of well-deserved success, many are entrepreneurs of unicorn startups today and people have

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:28.520
[Guest]: bungalows with indoor heated pools I am told, to which I am never invited.

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:31.320
[Guest]: But people have done really well for themselves.

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:36.480
[Guest]: I have consulted a therapist myself and one of the things my therapist has also told me

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:41.880
[Guest]: is that because I live in Gurgaon, she said that lot of people who consult me in Gurgaon

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:47.880
[Guest]: are from these very high net worth backgrounds and many of them are deeply depressed today

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:52.760
[Guest]: because they find no purpose in what they are doing because they've spent so many years

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:56.440
[Guest]: of their life chasing material wealth and money.

01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:02.880
[Guest]: So nothing against people who do want money, I think it's a very, you can do a lot of good

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:05.160
[Guest]: for the world when you have a lot of money.

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:10.000
[Guest]: But also one of the things that I am taught me about what not to do is that chase.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.240
[Guest]: I saw it very early and I figured out very early that that's not the path for me.

01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:18.520
[Guest]: So that way it kind of strongly molded the person I am.

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:23.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, the zero-sum mentality is weird to me because the real world is a positive something,

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:24.280
[Unknown]: right?

01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.280
[Unknown]: Exactly.

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.440
[Amit Varma]: So you would imagine that if MBA is teaching, then they will teach that mentality, incentives

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.440
[Amit Varma]: will be different.

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:29.440
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:36.360
[Amit Varma]: But if this sounds like incredibly toxic to me and on the point of money and happiness

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:42.080
[Amit Varma]: and again, if I misremember, please forgive me, but I think Arthur Brooks had once written

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:47.520
[Amit Varma]: an essay on this where he pointed out that when people surveyed the happiness of the

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:51.600
[Amit Varma]: USA, he was talking about the, he was talking about America when people surveyed the happiness

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.880
[Amit Varma]: of the USA.

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:57.720
[Amit Varma]: And I think it was of men in USA if I remember correctly, but it certainly applies in my

01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.640
[Amit Varma]: mind best there.

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:05.080
[Amit Varma]: What they found was that you have this curve where you go gradually downwards in terms

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:08.640
[Amit Varma]: of happiness until your mid 40s or late 40s.

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:11.240
[Amit Varma]: And then you suddenly start becoming much happier.

01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:16.400
[Amit Varma]: And his explanation for this is that that is around the time you realize that all your

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:21.440
[Amit Varma]: life you felt you behaved as if your happiness is contingent on money.

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:25.720
[Amit Varma]: And by that time, mid 40s, late 40s, you've made all the money in the world, and you haven't

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:26.720
[Amit Varma]: been happy.

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.160
[Amit Varma]: And then you realize this is not where happiness lies.

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:33.200
[Amit Varma]: And it lies wherever then is for people to define it for themselves where happiness lies,

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:38.000
[Amit Varma]: but at least they know what not to do, as you said, and then they turn elsewhere and

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.320
[Amit Varma]: then true happiness kind of comes and I'm of course in my late 40s, but I've never really

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.880
[Amit Varma]: made much money here.

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:48.600
[Amit Varma]: Heated indoor swimming pool, mere paas hota toh main gareepon pe baad deta, main kya karunga

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:54.680
[Amit Varma]: heated indoor swimming pool, but, but yeah, I mean, so that's, that's, again, the fact

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:59.460
[Amit Varma]: that there's no correlation between money and happiness, toh pata hi hai, but it's kind

01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:04.360
[Amit Varma]: of sad if these sort of mindsets are being propagated.

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:11.080
[Amit Varma]: So after you finished your MBA, you know, you eventually landed up in the civil services,

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:16.640
[Amit Varma]: but take me through that journey of your deciding ki kya karna hai aur waha pe kyu gaye, like,

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:21.600
[Amit Varma]: did you decide while doing your MBA that, you know, you want to go for the civil services

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:27.120
[Amit Varma]: or was the civil services always an attractive option, you know, like when I was growing

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:32.960
[Amit Varma]: up, it was always, you know, doctor medical toh hai hi, but IAS ka exam though, that is

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:37.400
[Amit Varma]: a, you know, the biggest prestige and obviously I grew up in the 70s and 80s where, you know,

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.560
[Amit Varma]: the state was all powerful.

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:43.340
[Amit Varma]: So even more so there, private sector toh zyada tha hi nahi and me being a rebel and

01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:48.080
[Amit Varma]: my father already being in the IAS, I was like mujhe nahi karna, main toh writer banunga,

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:53.920
[Amit Varma]: main attic mein staff karunga and then I will make a lot of money and have an indoor swimming

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.720
[Amit Varma]: pool with my books too, well, none of that happened.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:01.320
[Amit Varma]: But so what was your sort of journey like in that regard?

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:07.080
[Guest]: Yeah, so UPSC karna hai was never a target in life ke yeh toh karna hi hai or even that

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:12.680
[Guest]: early prestige that you spoke about had kind of, I think, dwindled a bit by the 2000s,

01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:17.240
[Guest]: late 2000s is when I finished my MBA.

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:24.200
[Guest]: And at that time, the done thing was Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, BCG, in mein jao, day zero

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:29.120
[Guest]: placement that was a thing in IMK, there was a placement season and day zero is when the

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.880
[Guest]: best firms with the best money and the international postings will come.

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:37.200
[Guest]: Then day ones mein thoda sa desi firms will come, then day two, three pe aayo toh you

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.400
[Guest]: are the leftovers.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:43.520
[Guest]: That was the, it was a very strong hierarchy like that and there was a summer placement

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:48.760
[Guest]: at the end of one year, first semester actually, at the end of the first trimester itself,

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:52.760
[Guest]: there was a summer placement for the end of one year wala summer break mein jaa ke aap

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:57.920
[Guest]: do maheena internship karte ho, toh wo internship mein where you got placed kind of seals your

01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:03.200
[Guest]: fate in terms of where your life will head is, at least that was a popular notion and

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:06.680
[Guest]: also that also seals how your peers see you.

01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:10.480
[Guest]: So your peers are also all trained to see you as yeh day zero person hai, yeh day one

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.520
[Guest]: person hai, yeh day two person hai and that's the caste system in which we will also make

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:15.560
[Guest]: our friendships now.

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:19.040
[Guest]: Like I said, you know, wo jo eye contact groups ban raha hai, wo day zero ke ladko ke beech

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:20.040
[Amit Varma]: mein ban raha hai.

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:21.200
[Guest]: Aap kaunsi thi?

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:25.840
[Guest]: This was interesting because of my 9.9 CGPA na, I got an interview call from pretty much

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:28.120
[Guest]: every company that was coming on day zero.

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:30.620
[Guest]: So I must have given 20 interviews in one day.

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:34.520
[Guest]: It is a crazy process, like there are these people with headsets walking all around ke

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:39.160
[Guest]: Mahima Avashisht is out of the McKinsey interview, now she's next heading towards first floor

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:43.800
[Guest]: Goldman Sachs ke room mein and like you're being shunted from room to room and for me

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:46.640
[Guest]: it was all very blinding and I was very thrown by it.

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:51.440
[Guest]: I was very, I mean, I was totally out of place.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:56.400
[Guest]: I was one of those people who were seen as the biggest promising candidates at the beginning

01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:00.880
[Guest]: of that day and by the end of that day I had failed all the interviews, like 20 interviews

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:02.160
[Guest]: in a row I had failed.

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.320
[Guest]: I mean, you can imagine self-esteem kahan neeche, patal log mein jaa ke girti ansaan

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:10.360
[Guest]: ki, like at the beginning people are seeing you as the rising star of tomorrow and at

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:12.320
[Guest]: the end they're like iski taraf dekho mat zyada.

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:14.320
[Amit Varma]: They didn't deserve you.

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:22.960
[Guest]: No, so by that time I was like, I mean, don't even look at her, she's a panauti, iski taraf

01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:26.480
[Guest]: dekho ke tumhare marks kam ho jaye, tumhare chances kam ho jaye.

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:31.520
[Guest]: So I got placed on what was called day 0.5, they came up with a new thing, which was like

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:36.080
[Guest]: the second day ki subah-subah there were some leftover Indian firms but were offering international

01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:37.080
[Guest]: postings.

01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:38.680
[Guest]: So I got into ICICI in London.

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:45.160
[Guest]: So ICICI was a very tame compared to all the formidable brands that came the day before

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:48.920
[Guest]: but it was a posting in London, so it was, so I often would say that I am the poorest

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:54.680
[Guest]: intern living in London because I literally had to mouth existence given the daily allowance

01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:56.200
[Guest]: I was getting from them.

01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:02.240
[Guest]: But my peers who were all other in the fancy firms of London were all living it up while

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:08.800
[Guest]: I was like yeh sandwich khaya jaye ke na khaya jaye, 2 pound ka hai, always converting to

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:09.800
[Guest]: rupees in my head.

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:13.880
[Guest]: But yeah, so it was like a semi-respectable internship that I got.

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:19.120
[Guest]: And again, at that time it was heartbreaking and shattered your self-esteem, like I said,

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.640
[Guest]: it was very, very depressing, that experience.

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:25.360
[Guest]: But again, in hindsight, I think, like you said, you know, your life would be so different

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:26.640
[Guest]: if you're born in privilege.

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.640
[Guest]: I think my life would also have been very different if on that day I had cracked an

01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:30.640
[Guest]: interview.

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:37.160
[Guest]: So that extreme string of many, many failures was actually, I think, good in the long run

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:43.480
[Guest]: because it gave me some distance from the whole craziness that was going on in that

01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.680
[Guest]: system.

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:47.960
[Guest]: And then that also kind of shaped the friends I made later.

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:52.240
[Guest]: And hum sab day one wale chote log apne-apne friendships banate the.

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:56.960
[Guest]: So we would, and that kind of gave me a lot more reality check of this is what real people

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:57.960
[Guest]: are like.

01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:02.120
[Guest]: I know a lot of people also on this campus, not everyone is success crazy.

01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:05.080
[Guest]: And so, so that was good.

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.960
[Guest]: So we were talking about UPSC, I'm sorry.

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:12.120
[Guest]: So then uske baad, by the time the final placements ka time aaya, it so happened that we were

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:13.280
[Guest]: also the recession year.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:21.160
[Guest]: So the subprime crisis hit in 2009 and 2008-ish and 2009 was the year of my final placements.

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.720
[Guest]: So basically it was like campus pe sanata, day zero pe chaar firms aayi hain, kyuki

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:31.120
[Guest]: baaki toh logon ko Lehman Brothers se PPO holte the, pre-placement offer, ki aapne summer

01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:34.360
[Guest]: internship itni achchi kari, ki we are giving you a job right now.

01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:39.520
[Guest]: So logon ko Lehman Brothers se PPO aaya, unhone partyan di, saara saar aash kiya aur that

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:42.440
[Guest]: day they are realizing it doesn't exist anymore.

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:49.480
[Guest]: So it was a huge shock for our campus and for like all the IMs were struggling and placements

01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.240
[Guest]: were down for everybody.

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:57.080
[Guest]: And for me it was, I thought theek hai, anyway apna toh hona nahi saa, badi firms mein toh

01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.720
[Guest]: kya hi fark padta hai.

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:03.280
[Guest]: But for me by that time, I had kind of made up my mind that I want to join a smaller firm

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:08.720
[Guest]: where first of all, like we said na, headlight fallacy ki itna hi dikh raha hai, toh kya

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:12.720
[Guest]: nahi karna hi dikh raha hai, toh finance nahi karna tha, yeh dikh raha tha, because people

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:16.720
[Guest]: from investment banks would come in their placement talks and tell us with great pride

01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:22.800
[Guest]: about how I used to work 22 hours a day and I slept on a couch in my office on the 36th

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:27.840
[Guest]: floor in New York on so-and-so Avenue, and I'd be like, good for you man, I don't want

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.600
[Guest]: that life for myself.

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:35.000
[Guest]: So finance nahi karna hai, itna clear tha, so I was like, the other option is consulting,

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.280
[Guest]: jaise doctor aur engineer hota hai na, waise finance aur consulting hota hai.

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:42.480
[Guest]: So then I thought, theek hai consulting mein kahin try karenge, maybe in a smaller firm

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:46.000
[Guest]: because like I said, bade wale mein toh apna chance hi nahi hai.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:51.680
[Guest]: So then I was, I got into this small firm which was, I mean they were, I think they

01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:57.280
[Guest]: had 13 employees at that time, and it was the first time they were hiring from IIMs,

01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:02.480
[Guest]: and we were brought in, 7 of us were hired from IIM Ahmedabad in Bangalore.

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:08.200
[Guest]: By the 6th month of joining that company, 6 of them had left, 7 mein se, and I was the

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.200
[Guest]: only one left.

01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:14.520
[Guest]: I think there was a lot also to do with the culture because many of my peers had prior

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:18.280
[Guest]: work experience, so they came with an expectation of what a company should be like, how it should

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:19.280
[Guest]: be run.

01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:24.040
[Guest]: Whereas this was a very small firm, and it was very individual driven.

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:29.920
[Guest]: So the founder, his thoughts, his philosophies were how the company operated.

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:37.320
[Guest]: So and everyone had to basically accept that his way is the right way, and the other way

01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:38.720
[Guest]: is exit.

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:43.040
[Guest]: So by 6th month, I realized everybody else had left, and they had also, the firm had

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:47.800
[Guest]: decided that IIM people ka culture is not for us, ye log bahut they have, they had their

01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:51.680
[Guest]: own rationale for why people quit, and the people who quit are still friends, they had

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.520
[Guest]: their own rationale for why they quit.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:58.920
[Guest]: Anyway, I persevered because I somehow found a middle ground where I was not accepting

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:04.800
[Guest]: complete devotion either, but also not so uncomfortable that I had to move out.

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:07.960
[Guest]: It also helped being a fresher because I had no prior experience, so there was no baseline

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:13.720
[Guest]: with which to compare what a working culture in a professional organization should be.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:18.200
[Guest]: So 3 years I stayed in that firm, and my client was State Bank of India.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:21.800
[Guest]: I can say that was now made public.

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:26.640
[Guest]: So there was a project we were doing there called Citizen SBI, which was how do you,

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:31.560
[Guest]: there are I think 2 lakh employees in State Bank of India, and how do you make them all

01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:36.280
[Guest]: feel like citizens of State Bank of India, how do you make them think like contributors,

01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:40.960
[Guest]: you know, not just like people clocking in and clocking out, but find purpose in their

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.000
[Guest]: work and therefore help communities around them.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.920
[Guest]: So great idea, and I did, I was in what they call the business modeling team, which meant

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:55.240
[Guest]: I, you should travel across the country and take pilot projects in various communities

01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.800
[Guest]: with the SBI branch at the center.

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:06.360
[Guest]: So I traveled to some tapioca farmers in Salem, some petni sari weavers in Nashik, some stone

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:08.840
[Guest]: carvers in Konark in Odisha.

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:13.040
[Guest]: So across the country I would travel to these communities, talk to these people, figure

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:17.720
[Guest]: out what is their value chain, where is the gap, can it be filled with finance or can

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:19.620
[Guest]: it be filled with skill development.

01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:23.680
[Guest]: So like stone carvers for example, their big problem is that all the men have migrated

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:30.120
[Guest]: to Rajasthan for carving and all the women or unskilled people are left behind and they

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:34.600
[Guest]: have to manage somehow and there's a lot of problems, migration, poverty, yes sir.

01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:37.360
[Guest]: So there was a skill development initiative needed there.

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:42.120
[Guest]: So SBI did a partnership with NABARD and Bhola inko theek hai, we'll do this here.

01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:46.240
[Guest]: And I mean there were different inputs that were given, but State Bank kind of was for

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:49.400
[Guest]: the first time thinking from the perspective of the community.

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:54.840
[Guest]: So it was not a sales, typical sales methodology of the calls we get na, madam card lelo, madam

01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:56.000
[Guest]: loan lelo.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.600
[Guest]: So it wasn't like that.

01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:02.240
[Guest]: I mean I got to see a glimpse of real India right, for the first time.

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:06.120
[Guest]: So far I've only seen this IIT, IIM ka posh world and their own first world problems.

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:10.080
[Guest]: So for the first time I'm seeing what real India looks like, what the problems of real

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.720
[Guest]: people of India are.

01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:17.240
[Guest]: And I realized that just a financial institution has this immense potential to change their

01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:18.240
[Guest]: lives.

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:22.520
[Guest]: And I would see that there's like legitimate, tangible transformation happening in their

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:26.920
[Guest]: lives and their quality of living, in their income, because of small, small initiatives

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:29.560
[Guest]: that we made like a training program, zara saag.

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:35.920
[Guest]: To us it's nothing and to them it's the difference between two very different standards of living.

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:41.800
[Guest]: And so my mom and dad had mentioned UPSC before, after MBA or around that time.

01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:45.560
[Guest]: But I kind of dismissed it at that time as, you know, like you said, old world thinking

01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:48.240
[Guest]: ki haan, aapke zamane mein sarkari hota tha, ab nahi hota hai.

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:53.200
[Guest]: And the joke was that somebody from our campus got placed in McKinsey and he told his father

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:57.440
[Guest]: and father said, kya hua, Punjab National Bank hire nahi kar raha tha?

01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:03.240
[Guest]: So that was a joke ke our parents' generation doesn't understand what our aspirations are.

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:07.400
[Guest]: So we were kind of all trained to ignore it.

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:12.520
[Guest]: So UPSC ka, they had put it on the table but I had never given it much thought until I

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:14.040
[Guest]: saw this experience.

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:18.200
[Guest]: I had this experience and then I realized that my dad would tell me that he was also

01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:23.800
[Guest]: a public sector banker and how the collector would hold meetings of 20 bankers, 20 banks

01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:28.480
[Guest]: in front of him or her and tell them ki aap yahaan pe yeh karenge, aap wahaan pe woh karenge,

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:33.360
[Guest]: aap us community ko loan denge, aap ye cheez mein help karenge, yahaan pe disaster hogaya,

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:34.960
[Guest]: yahaan relief mein aap funding karenge.

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:39.720
[Guest]: So like, then I realized that, oh my God, there is an organization behind these financial

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:43.520
[Guest]: institutions which has even more of a transformative power.

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:48.680
[Guest]: So for me, that was the point where I suddenly realized that, you know, this is something

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.760
[Guest]: worth trying at least.

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:54.920
[Guest]: I was told when I started applying ke, haan, bohot lamba process hota hai.

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:55.920
[Guest]: It is.

01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:00.160
[Guest]: UPSC is a very long, one-year-long exam and very few people clear it.

01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.320
[Guest]: And I was working already.

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:06.160
[Guest]: Like, people sit at home for years and years and prepare for it and go to coaching classes

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:09.520
[Guest]: and live away from home in coaching centers.

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:15.600
[Guest]: But and I'm here, I'm like doing a full-time job, traveling around the place and also thinking

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:16.600
[Guest]: ke UPSC kar lenge.

01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:20.960
[Guest]: So, reality check shuru se tha, many people have told me, ke bohot kam chance hai, but

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.360
[Guest]: try kar lo kya harz hai.

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:25.880
[Guest]: Ek baar try kar lena, nahi hoga, agle saal achche se did dina.

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:27.840
[Guest]: So that was the attitude going in.

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:32.640
[Guest]: And so, the format of UPSC, for those who don't know, I'll just explain is, one, there

01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:38.160
[Guest]: is a multiple choice screening test which happens, in my time it used to happen somewhere

01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.160
[Guest]: around June-ish.

01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:43.880
[Guest]: Then around August-September mein uska result aayega, October-November mein there'll be

01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:44.880
[Guest]: a mains exam.

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.080
[Guest]: Mains exam is nine written papers of three hours each.

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:53.720
[Guest]: I don't want to go into details of what all, but general studies, selective subjects, language

01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:59.200
[Guest]: subjects, kar-kar ke nau paper, satta-ees gante ke exams over a week or two weeks.

01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:03.800
[Guest]: And woh clear hua toh, screening clear hua toh, mains aur mains clear hua toh, next year

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:06.720
[Guest]: around the same time, March wagara mein aapka interview call.

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:11.680
[Guest]: Aur phir woh bhi clear hua, toh you are in, otherwise agle June mein firse screening likho.

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:16.600
[Guest]: So that's the cycle which many people are in, and often aspirants end up spending five,

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:18.440
[Guest]: six, seven years in that cycle.

01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:22.960
[Guest]: So for me, it was a very clear thing ki I didn't want to write it again and again.

01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:28.540
[Guest]: I felt like ki yaar, these are my formative youth years, I don't want to spend them preparing

01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:31.200
[Guest]: for some exam that nobody gets through.

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.880
[Guest]: I'm going to give it one shot, hua toh hua, nahi hua toh, thank you, bye-bye.

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:38.960
[Guest]: So luckily for me, maine kuch prepare nahi kiya tha, but usse saal, there was a thing

01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:44.120
[Guest]: introduced called CSAT, which is Civil Services Aptitude Test, which is a cat ka bacha test.

01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:48.840
[Guest]: So because maine cat kiya hua tha, that exam was very easy for me and I sailed through.

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:53.840
[Guest]: And later, if you look back around that time, 2012, there were a lot of protests that this

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:58.800
[Guest]: CSAT gives an advantage to people like me essentially, people who have had the privilege

01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:05.800
[Guest]: of coaching in CAT and MBA and all that and engineers, because most of Indian students

01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:07.160
[Guest]: don't have that.

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:13.200
[Guest]: And for them, cracking a logical aptitude data reasoning exam is, is much harder.

01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:17.840
[Guest]: And so anyway, there was a whole protest about that, but I was in that lucky year, which

01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:19.960
[Guest]: skimmed through because of that.

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:25.560
[Guest]: So woh hogaya and then I got a call for my mains, that was around August and I was like

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:30.400
[Guest]: kya 2 mahine mein exam hai and these are these 27 hours of paper that I have to write with,

01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:32.000
[Guest]: I have zero knowledge right now.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.360
[Guest]: I mean, you have no need to know things like public administration, constitution of India,

01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:40.160
[Guest]: freedom struggle of India, woh sab, was the farthest things from my mind, I was living

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.680
[Guest]: a very different life.

01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:47.440
[Guest]: So I thought ki 2 mahina I'll just take sabbatical and again, thankfully small company, very

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:48.680
[Guest]: personalized culture.

01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:53.000
[Guest]: So I told my boss that aisa aisa hua hai, I've gotten through this exam, I want to

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.240
[Guest]: give it one serious attempt.

01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:57.680
[Guest]: Nahi hua toh I'm coming back to you, can I take 2 months off?

01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:01.120
[Guest]: So they were kind enough to say haan theek hai jao, jeelo apni zindagi.

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:06.040
[Guest]: So I came to Delhi and I, so I used to work in Bombay, by the way, all these 3 years.

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:10.960
[Guest]: So I came to Delhi and ghar pe baith ke padhai wadahi shuru kari, thoda bohot pata kiya coaching

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:15.440
[Guest]: centers and people are like, this was in 2011, and people are like, achha aapko 2013 ki

01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:17.800
[Guest]: preparation kar diya hai na, aaye aaye yeh enrollment.

01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:23.720
[Guest]: So nahi mujhe, 2 mahine baad 11 ki exam ki, they're like, ho hi nahi sakta madam.

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:28.520
[Guest]: People were just on my face, told me ki I don't want to steal your money and then give

01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:29.520
[Guest]: you false hope.

01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:30.520
[Guest]: Nahi hua sakta.

01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:35.320
[Guest]: And then some people did make efforts to steal my money and said, ek lakh rupay de do kar

01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:36.320
[Guest]: denge.

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:37.720
[Guest]: So either way, kuch nahi chal raha tha.

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:42.480
[Guest]: Then I found out there was this group circle of fellow aspirants, all of them studying

01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:44.920
[Guest]: together and doing group study somewhere in Noida.

01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:50.760
[Guest]: So I started, roz apna scooty utha gaye subah ghar se, maha gaye 2-3 ghanta suna baith

01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:56.320
[Guest]: ke, kya baatein chal rahi hain, achha Mahatma Gandhi, Champaran Satyagraha, abhi ye baatein

01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:58.520
[Guest]: chal rahi hain, chalo thoda bahut sun liya.

01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:03.720
[Guest]: And then, I mean, borrow notes from people and someone gave a photocopy of some coaching

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:05.640
[Guest]: class ka notes and wo sab pad liya.

01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:09.280
[Guest]: The two subjects I had to take, I chose public administration and sociology, which was a

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:14.400
[Guest]: very idealistic move on my part because I thought I ideally could have taken an engineering

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:19.200
[Guest]: or logical reasoning subject which would have given me an edge, but I was like, ke dekho,

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:20.200
[Guest]: hona toh hai nahi.

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:24.080
[Guest]: Toh why waste reading, time reading stuff that I already know, let me learn something

01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:28.160
[Guest]: new about the country, this is a good opportunity to do that.

01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:30.800
[Guest]: I'll go back to my job with some value added.

01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:33.880
[Guest]: So that's why I took these two subjects.

01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:39.120
[Guest]: And then I took one, idhar udhar se photocopy notes, Police Act of 1861 mein kya hua tha,

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:43.920
[Guest]: usme ye uske flaws kya hain, aur future mein kya reforms are necessary, so and so committee

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:48.360
[Guest]: iss saal mein baith ki unke ye recommendations the, over 200 years, all the recommendations

01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:53.160
[Guest]: that have been given and ignored by government of India, wo sab pada, things like that, very

01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:59.120
[Guest]: very hardcore stuff which normal people, engineers, MBAs don't know this stuff, right, like I

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:00.120
[Guest]: didn't.

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:03.080
[Guest]: So wo sab I got very familiarized with all that.

01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:08.080
[Guest]: I think my writing really helped because my writing skills are decent and I'm able to

01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:14.600
[Guest]: express complicated thoughts, process them into simpler words and churn out a very understandable,

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:17.600
[Guest]: comprehensible presentation of it.

01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:19.440
[Guest]: So that really helped, I think, with me.

01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:20.440
[Guest]: That was my biggest strength.

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:25.200
[Guest]: So somehow I cleared mains and that was very shocking to everyone, including myself.

01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:28.960
[Guest]: Ki iska kaise ho gaya, ye toh, abhi toh aayi thi.

01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:37.200
[Guest]: And then I remember I had had a minor surgery on my leg and I was like, wo kharke, I was

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:40.960
[Guest]: bedridden and wheelchair chal rahi thi ek hafte tak.

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:46.600
[Guest]: And I was, tab khabar aayi that you've cleared and I was like, days, then I said, acha, and

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:50.240
[Guest]: then I passed out again because I was under a lot of pain medication.

01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:53.240
[Guest]: And then I woke up and I was like, I had this weird dream.

01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:59.040
[Guest]: And my parents were like, nahi sahi me hua hai, it wasn't a dream.

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:03.120
[Guest]: So then within a month I had that interview.

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:10.000
[Guest]: So I took thoda extension of that leave for my surgery and gave the interview and it was

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.960
[Guest]: a very, I mean, luckily I'd heard all these horror stories about stress interviews and

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:17.920
[Guest]: all, woh bahut interview aur uth ke beech mein chala jaata hai, tum pe chillane lagta

01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:22.160
[Guest]: hai, ye sab aisa kuch nahi hua, they were very civil and nice and we had a good conversation

01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:28.320
[Guest]: about my academics, my IIM experience, going to Germany, ye sab baate baate hui, thoda

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:33.520
[Guest]: bahut aaj ki newspaper se ye pada, wo cheez ka reform batao, uske baar mein tumhara, some

01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:35.480
[Guest]: textbook questions that are there.

01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:39.680
[Guest]: For the most part I did well, I thought, and actually I did quite well because ultimately

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:44.120
[Guest]: I cleared it and when the mark sheet came, I realised that I'd only just made it through

01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:49.120
[Guest]: the mains exam with a very small margin, but my interview went really exceedingly well,

01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:51.600
[Guest]: which is why I finally made it to the cut off.

01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:56.840
[Guest]: So interview mein I might have been among the toppers in the country, but because mains

01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:00.240
[Guest]: was very bare minimum passable marks.

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:06.360
[Guest]: So my rank was I think some 601 or something and there's only 1000 civil servants selected

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:10.760
[Guest]: in a year, out of, by the way, 6 lakh applicants in my year.

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:16.280
[Guest]: So I was selected and I got into this animal called the Indian Information Service, which

01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:21.360
[Guest]: I had never heard about, nobody's heard about it, let's be honest, I'll give one toffee

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:25.720
[Guest]: to any listener of Seen and the Unseen who writes back saying mujhe pada tha yeh service

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:26.720
[Amit Varma]: ke baare mein.

01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:30.560
[Amit Varma]: Ab kitne toffee doge, mere listeners ko kaafi kuch pata hai, especially those who've done

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:34.600
[Amit Varma]: my course and rewritten that press release I used to give you guys to rewrite from the

01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.480
[Amit Varma]: Indian Information Services itself.

01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:40.600
[Guest]: I'm so grateful it wasn't one of my press releases that you were giving as an example

01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:41.600
[Amit Varma]: of bad writing.

01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:42.600
[Amit Varma]: Were they really so bad?

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:46.720
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean, just for the benefit of my listeners, to give an example of what a bad sentence

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:51.440
[Amit Varma]: is and what a bad paragraph is, I take, you know, in my course, I take examples from a

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:56.560
[Amit Varma]: particular press release written by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.

01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:01.160
[Amit Varma]: And it so happens that you also work there and wrote press releases for them.

01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:02.160
[Guest]: I did, I did.

01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:06.920
[Guest]: And when you gave us that assignment, I was like, link kholo jaldi se, meri toh nahi kahi

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:11.120
[Guest]: press release, which is being shared as an example of bad writing and people are going

01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:12.120
[Guest]: to rewrite it.

01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:16.280
[Guest]: And luckily, it wasn't and it was a very good example of bad writing, I have to say.

01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:21.760
[Guest]: So, haan, so I got into this service and then it was, ke yaar hua toh hai nahi, aaye is

01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:24.480
[Guest]: kya fark padta hai, chh rahne dete hain, jaane dete hain.

01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:28.560
[Guest]: And then people advised ke nahi, dekho, try toh kar lo, ek baar join toh kar lo, let's

01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:32.120
[Guest]: see, nahi hua toh chhod dena and ho gaya.

01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:36.760
[Guest]: If you find it good, it can be life-changing, which it obviously is.

01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:41.640
[Guest]: And the, I did a little bit of digging into it and found out what, what this service does

01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:43.920
[Guest]: in the first place, hi hota kya hai.

01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:48.960
[Guest]: And I thought that basically it's a service that handles all the media of the government,

01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:53.480
[Guest]: which is Doordarshan News, All India Radio, DEAVP, which was, which is an organization

01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:57.400
[Guest]: now called, I think BOC, which is now, an organization which does all this chhapoing

01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:02.720
[Guest]: of government ads, which you see all over, a bit of community radio or some grassroots

01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:04.400
[Guest]: communication also.

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:06.280
[Guest]: And press releases, of course, PIB.

01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:12.080
[Guest]: So Press Information Bureau is the PR agency of Government of India in a way.

01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:16.660
[Guest]: And that's the agency which organizes press conferences with ministers and you write press

01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:21.600
[Guest]: releases for your ministry and that's how the media gets to know what your ministry

01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:23.040
[Guest]: or what the government is doing.

01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:28.520
[Guest]: So I was like, ek potential, one thing that really attracted me for this service was that,

01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:30.320
[Guest]: you know, making people aware of their rights.

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:34.200
[Guest]: The grassroots communication, which is a very small part of it, was the one that attracted

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:39.480
[Guest]: me the most because I felt like, as an, as an Indian, I don't know what are the schemes

01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:41.160
[Guest]: that the government has.

01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:44.920
[Guest]: And of course, I'm privileged enough to not need many of those benefits also.

01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:48.440
[Guest]: But even people who do need those benefits genuinely are often not aware that these are

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:53.120
[Guest]: the things that are our rights and we can demand these rights from the government, ki

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:57.920
[Guest]: hume ghar mein shochale chahiye, hona chahiye, we need it, we want it, it is our right.

01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:02.240
[Guest]: Something like this, people don't have the awareness to even, let alone demand, the agency

01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:04.960
[Guest]: to demand the right, not even the awareness to know the right.

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:10.080
[Guest]: So for me, that was the big hook and attraction of this service, that I can generate public

01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.840
[Guest]: awareness about rights of citizens.

01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:14.720
[Guest]: And so I thought, theek hai, kar lete hain, join.

01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:20.240
[Guest]: And that's how I got in the long answer to your short question about how UPSC happened.

01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:23.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I won't call it a long answer, because it's a long journey.

01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:25.260
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the journey is like that, what do you do?

01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:27.600
[Amit Varma]: So how was it in the civil services?

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:33.160
[Amit Varma]: Like once you're actually in the machinery, you know, did you feel frustrated that it's

01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:35.440
[Amit Varma]: not making as much of a difference as it can?

01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:38.680
[Amit Varma]: Or did you feel proud of the difference that you were making?

01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:44.640
[Amit Varma]: And what is it that then prompted you to kind of look elsewhere and eventually kind of quit

01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:45.640
[Amit Varma]: the civil services?

01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:48.720
[Guest]: So this is another very long story.

01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:54.840
[Guest]: So basically I get in, September of 2012 is when the training started.

01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:59.160
[Guest]: So first you have to do a three-month foundational course training, which every service has to

01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:00.160
[Guest]: do.

01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:03.700
[Guest]: And after that, depending on what service you are, you do a specialized training.

01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:08.800
[Guest]: So there's IAS, IFS, IPS, un sab ki apni-apni academy, apni-apni training ho rahi hai.

01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:13.920
[Guest]: But shuru mein, everyone congregates in one academy, used to congregate in one academy,

01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:18.120
[Guest]: which was the Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy in Mussoorie.

01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:22.880
[Guest]: Now as the batch, that was when the batch sizes were 200-300 people, your dad's time

01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:23.880
[Guest]: maybe.

01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:27.280
[Guest]: Now as the batch sizes have grown, they are not able to fit everyone in Mussoorie.

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:32.800
[Guest]: IAS, IPS, IFS, fahan jaayenge pahad mein padhne, baaki log jahaan jahaan girenge, maa girenge.

01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:33.800
[Guest]: So I fell in Nagpur.

01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:38.080
[Guest]: There is an academy called National Academy of Direct Taxes, which is the specialized

01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:42.440
[Guest]: academy for IRS, income tax service.

01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:47.640
[Guest]: And wahan pe, they used to do foundation course for some other leftover services, which included

01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:48.960
[Guest]: mine.

01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:52.480
[Guest]: And lot of my batchmates were from Forest Service, which was very interesting because

01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:55.440
[Guest]: they have, they are the only service which has a different exam.

01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:58.960
[Guest]: All the rest of us came from one exam, UPSC ka.

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:05.560
[Guest]: So Forest Service people were, a lot of batchmates were from the Northeast and it was a good

01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:06.560
[Guest]: experience that way.

01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:10.680
[Guest]: Three months we spent together and it's very intensive, they will take you on a trek

01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:17.600
[Guest]: to the Himalayas and then they do one Bharat Darshan, I've traveled to Andaman and Leladakh,

01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:20.840
[Guest]: everything in one, happening in one month, you're traveling here to there.

01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:25.160
[Guest]: So it was very, very intensive and very interesting.

01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:30.240
[Guest]: And then, but yeah, there was one thing that was disillusioning right from the beginning,

01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:36.320
[Guest]: which is when I came in and I came in with these naive idealistic notions of the why

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:41.200
[Guest]: would be the same for everyone, that why is, why do you join civil service, to serve your

01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:43.320
[Guest]: country, to do better for society.

01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:45.160
[Guest]: For me, that was the most obvious answer.

01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:50.280
[Guest]: When I come in, I realize that I am a very small minority, the people who've come in

01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:51.920
[Guest]: with that perspective.

01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:57.320
[Guest]: So a lot of people have come in for power, a lot of people have come in for prestige,

01:58:57.320 --> 01:58:59.280
[Guest]: some people have come for corruption.

01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:04.880
[Guest]: So some people have come just for, ab hum unko dikhayenge, jino ne humein press kiya.

01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:11.000
[Guest]: And I mean, at the outset, obviously, there's this judgmental lens, which I'm already bringing

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.440
[Guest]: in, right, that my way was better than their way.

01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:17.280
[Guest]: But when you talk to people, and you hear their life stories, you realize that you asked

01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:22.000
[Guest]: me earlier about how our upbringing shapes us, you know, and that's, this is a very stark

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000
[Guest]: example of it.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.720
[Guest]: And I think we've discussed this before offline, which is, like one of my batchmates told me

01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:31.040
[Guest]: that he's from what is called the backward caste and wo boltha hamaare gaon mein we were

01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:37.520
[Guest]: always treated as untouchables, humari maa ko khana nahi milta tha, humko itni mushkil

01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:42.960
[Guest]: se bada kiya, and ye caste wali log humko dabate the, ab hum unko dikhayenge, ab hum

01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:46.920
[Guest]: unko dabayenge, ab main gaon jaunga, laal batti ki gaadi mein aur main unko dikhaunga.

01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:53.360
[Guest]: So I mean, like I'm saying, you know, from a very urban and this idealistic mindset of

01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:58.480
[Guest]: all is good with the world, it seems very shady ke arey aap yahan pe power aur dabane

01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:01.960
[Guest]: ek doosre ko aayo, ye petty politics karne aayo, desh ki seva karo.

02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:06.200
[Guest]: But when you get to know their stories, you realize that, well, if you were born in that

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:09.280
[Guest]: place, you might also have grown up thinking like this.

02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:13.040
[Guest]: So it's all logical, but it's also unfortunate.

02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:16.760
[Guest]: So there was a lot of this thing about arey IS ko laal batti ki gaadi milti, humein kyu

02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:20.920
[Guest]: nahi milti hai, hum is service mein hain, hum bhi toh ye kar rahe hain, hum itne senior

02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:25.760
[Guest]: officer hain, humara, jab hum office aayenge toh humara dabba uthane ke liye ek peon aana

02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:30.800
[Guest]: chahiye neeche, humein gaadi ka darwaza koi aur kholega, hum kyu kholege, hum desh ke

02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:32.480
[Guest]: civil servant hain.

02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:37.040
[Guest]: So I mean, there's a lot of that, which is the overwhelming majority.

02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:40.880
[Amit Varma]: Is it literally at that kind of comical level that I want someone to pick up my tiffin box,

02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:43.000
[Guest]: I want someone to open the door of my car?

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.000
[Guest]: It is.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000
[Guest]: It is.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.120
[Guest]: Yeah, those are like real, very tangible, not just benefits, but reasons why people

02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:50.120
[Guest]: come in.

02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:54.680
[Guest]: That I don't want a job where hoga McKenzie bohot bada crorepati, par wo toh khud apna

02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:59.440
[Guest]: darwaza kholta hai gaadi ka, mera darwaza koi aur khodlega aankhe, chahiye I'm earning

02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:01.440
[Guest]: 10% of what that person does.

02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:02.440
[Unknown]: Wow, so sad.

02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:05.960
[Guest]: Yeah, but for the majority of India, that is the aspiration still.

02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:12.000
[Guest]: And even dowry, for example, is a big motivator, ke dowry ka rate card hota hai aadmiyon ka,

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.200
[Guest]: aapko shayad pata hoga.

02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:18.600
[Guest]: Even in IIM, my male batchmates would discuss it, ke IITN ho gaye, ek crore dowry ho gayi,

02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:21.000
[Guest]: ab IIM bhi kar liye, ab do crore dowry ho gayi.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.280
[Guest]: Ab iske upar civil service kar lo, toh soch lo kya ho jayega, hai na?

02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:28.360
[Guest]: Toh phir politician ki beti se shadi kar lo, phir wahan pohat jao, baad mein mantri ban

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.520
[Guest]: jaoge, toh phir life toh take off kar gayi ekdum.

02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:34.920
[Guest]: So all of these are life plans that people come in with.

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:39.400
[Guest]: And genuine, serious life plans, it's not comical to them, it's very serious.

02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:42.320
[Guest]: People live these lives and people see real value in it.

02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:47.440
[Guest]: And again, from their perspective, it makes a bit of sense also, as unfortunate as it

02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:48.800
[Guest]: is for the country.

02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:53.400
[Guest]: So yeah, that's also where I met Salil, my husband, because he was in income tax doing

02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:56.280
[Guest]: his specialized training there, two years senior to me.

02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:00.040
[Guest]: And I think I was talking to him last night about what I'll tell you about how we met

02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:05.400
[Guest]: and I said that, you know what, whether we like it or not, we bonded a lot over this

02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:10.680
[Guest]: solitude that we both felt, you know, that we are like these, I don't want to make it

02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:16.760
[Guest]: sound too dramatic, but we are these people, few hand-picked people, you can count them

02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:20.960
[Guest]: on fingertips, who have genuinely come here with that perspective, who want to learn,

02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:25.600
[Guest]: who want to listen in class, how can I contribute in my service in the future, who are not here,

02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:27.840
[Guest]: let's bunk the class, it's done now.

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:32.760
[Guest]: So you know, that clearing of UPSC, the big difference is, there is a small group of people

02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:36.440
[Guest]: who see it as the beginning of their journey, but there's an overwhelming majority who sees

02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:37.440
[Guest]: that as the culmination.

02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:38.440
[Guest]: Now life is set.

02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:43.160
[Guest]: Now we don't need to study, we don't need to work hard, this is what we were aiming

02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:47.840
[Guest]: for, this is why we slogged for five years, seven years at home, and finally we've made

02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:50.600
[Guest]: it in life and this is it, life has come to a full stop.

02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:53.080
[Guest]: Now we have to enjoy it.

02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:57.480
[Guest]: So as, I'm sorry, I'm sure I sound very ungrateful to the environment.

02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:02.920
[Amit Varma]: No, this is a great frame of looking at it, you know, for some people it's a start, for

02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:06.320
[Amit Varma]: some people it's the end, or you could say for some people it's a means to an end, you

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:10.040
[Amit Varma]: know, you wanted it because you want to make India better, while for some people it's an

02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:14.800
[Amit Varma]: end in themselves, they want it, that someone will open the door of the car.

02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:15.800
[Guest]: Correct.

02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:16.800
[Guest]: Exactly.

02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:23.160
[Guest]: Now, you know, Mr. I think you've interviewed Mr. Jayaprakash Narayan, so the only function

02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:28.160
[Guest]: where I was invited as a for felicitation, because I was in Bombay and there was a college

02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:34.640
[Guest]: in Pune for governance, and they said that the people from Bombay-Pune area will be invited.

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:38.480
[Guest]: I mean, by the way, in real India, people are washed with milk, and they are worshipped,

02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:43.360
[Guest]: and their aarti is performed, and there are big rallies that our boy has cracked UPSC.

02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:49.480
[Guest]: Anyway, I was obviously a very urban, lost in crores of people in Mumbai, one of them,

02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:53.800
[Guest]: so I was surprised that somebody even knew that I lived in Bombay and invited me to this

02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:58.920
[Guest]: thing, and he was there to kind of welcome the youngsters joining the service, and he

02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:02.960
[Guest]: gave an address there, which to this day I remember, he said, there are three things

02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:08.520
[Guest]: that you need as a civil servant, one is integrity, which is basic, he's like, this is hygiene,

02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:14.160
[Guest]: so don't go out being very proud about, I am a very honest officer, this is the bare

02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:18.720
[Guest]: minimum for you, and he's like, I know plenty of honest officers who go to office with their

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:23.920
[Guest]: lunch box and come back home, so they didn't do any work, so what's the point of honesty,

02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:26.920
[Guest]: you're garrowing a huge flag of it.

02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:31.240
[Guest]: Of course, many people don't even meet that criteria, but that is, for you, it should

02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:34.520
[Guest]: be a hygiene, it should not be something to feel pride in.

02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:39.640
[Guest]: Second is competence, which is often very badly lacking, and I want to circle back to

02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:44.640
[Guest]: that, which is the point I sent to you about problem with UPSC and therefore the country.

02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:49.400
[Guest]: Anyway, second is competence, that you should be able to do your job or be willing to pick

02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:51.440
[Guest]: up the skills needed to do it.

02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:53.680
[Guest]: And third was the willingness to contribute.

02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:58.480
[Guest]: So you can be very competent and honest, but still not make an effort, because like I said,

02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:05.480
[Guest]: this job is incentivized to be a culmination, because you'll meet 60-year-old, 65-year-old,

02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:10.280
[Guest]: 70-year-old men who still remember, that 35 years ago, I had written a public administration

02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:14.280
[Guest]: exam, and I had scored this much in that exam, and if I had scored 2 marks more, then my

02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:16.480
[Guest]: rank would have been this, and I would have gotten this service, and I would have gotten

02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:17.480
[Guest]: this carder.

02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:24.680
[Guest]: It's insane to me that I have met 60-65-year-old men who remember their scores from UPSC.

02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:30.360
[Guest]: I have forgotten my score, but people remember, and that too in a sectional, in a subject

02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:34.040
[Guest]: paper, if this mark had come, then this impact in life.

02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:39.800
[Amit Varma]: Because counterfactual is so big, you know, that a person is writing press releases, but

02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:43.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, a little difference, he could have been in the IFS, he could have been chilling

02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:44.840
[Guest]: in London.

02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:45.840
[Guest]: Exactly.

02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:46.840
[Guest]: Correct.

02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:49.200
[Guest]: So this is what I was saying, the incentive is, so this is not the fault of the people

02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:51.680
[Unknown]: in the system, it's the fault of the system, right.

02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:56.800
[Guest]: So you're basically, those marks in that one exam, basically seal your fate till retirement.

02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:01.400
[Guest]: So unless you do something to change your trajectory, like foolish people like me do,

02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:05.400
[Guest]: but if you don't do that, your trajectory is pretty much decided now for the rest of

02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:06.400
[Guest]: your life.

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:10.440
[Guest]: Even your retirement age, at what position you'll retire, what money you'll be making

02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:15.720
[Guest]: at that age, you can all predict everything on day one in the academy when you're in your

02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:16.720
[Guest]: training.

02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:21.480
[Guest]: So because all of that is figured out, and there's going to be time-bound promotions.

02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:25.320
[Guest]: Unless you murder somebody, you might not be, you will not be fired.

02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:27.320
[Guest]: Unless you're too honest, you might be fired.

02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:31.240
[Amit Varma]: Unless you get caught murdering somebody, murder someone tu theek hai na, isme kya hai

02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:32.240
[Guest]: yeh tu.

02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:33.240
[Guest]: Good point.

02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:35.120
[Guest]: Very good, important clarification, unless you get caught.

02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:41.560
[Guest]: There was a guy who sexually harassed a girl in my batch and people saw it also, like she

02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:47.120
[Guest]: was sleeping, we were on our way to the track and he came and he grabbed her from behind

02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:48.680
[Guest]: while she was sleeping.

02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:54.360
[Guest]: And it was sexual harassment, there are eyewitnesses, his own batchmates know it.

02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:59.080
[Guest]: The girl felt it, woke up, caught him, red-handed, no action was taken.

02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:00.080
[Guest]: Why?

02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:04.040
[Guest]: Because kaun karega itna paperwork, agli 20 saal tak hum log ko yaha bulaya jayega Nagpur

02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:05.040
[Guest]: mein gawahiyan dene.

02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:09.920
[Guest]: Even the girl is like, yaar, mera toh poora career yahi ban jayega, isi ke waale me gawahi

02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:10.920
[Guest]: dena.

02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:16.800
[Guest]: So now that person is a civil servant in government of India, getting his dabba picked by somebody.

02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:20.760
[Guest]: So I mean, that's the way the system is designed.

02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:26.600
[Guest]: It is designed for you to be complacent and not want to grow, not want to contribute.

02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:31.600
[Guest]: So that was what Mr. Jayaprakash Narayan had said, those three things which I still remember

02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:34.040
[Guest]: to this day, that model office.

02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:39.320
[Guest]: And I often look at people from that lens also and I find that one of the three or sometimes

02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:43.960
[Guest]: many, more than one of the three are lacking in many officers, sadly.

02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:46.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, JP is one of the wisest people I've met.

02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:51.520
[Amit Varma]: I did a great episode with him, episode 149, and just one of the wisest people.

02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:56.040
[Amit Varma]: But the question I'd therefore throw at you, and I don't remember if I've asked him this,

02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:57.860
[Amit Varma]: but perhaps I will next time.

02:07:57.860 --> 02:08:01.840
[Amit Varma]: But the question I'd throw at you then is that, okay, agreed that these are basic things

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:05.320
[Amit Varma]: that you need integrity, you need to build the ability and the skill and you need to

02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:06.940
[Amit Varma]: have the willingness.

02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:10.960
[Amit Varma]: But all of these, in my view, depend on incentives.

02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:16.440
[Amit Varma]: If the system is designed well, if it is structurally what it should be, then all three of these

02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:21.400
[Amit Varma]: will flow automatically into every single person because you'll be incentivized to be

02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:22.440
[Unknown]: that way.

02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:28.080
[Amit Varma]: And right now, it clearly isn't like, A, there is too much power, which, you know, your incentives

02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:32.680
[Amit Varma]: are therefore for rent seeking, for corruption, for using that power for your own benefit.

02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:36.140
[Amit Varma]: There's too little accountability to kind of stop that.

02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:39.920
[Amit Varma]: And these are just very broad observations I'm making from the outside.

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:43.560
[Amit Varma]: But having actually been an insider within the system and thought about it the way you

02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:48.360
[Amit Varma]: have, you know, what would you say are the fundamental structural things that are wrong

02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:50.920
[Amit Varma]: with the system the way it is?

02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:55.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, what are the, what are the key things you would change in it if you could?

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:00.560
[Guest]: Yeah, so I didn't stay long enough in the system to do an analysis beyond what I have

02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:01.560
[Guest]: so far.

02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:03.240
[Guest]: But I'll tell you what I have so far.

02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:05.680
[Guest]: First step itself is the exam is wrong.

02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:09.560
[Guest]: One exam for a 23 or something services, right?

02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:12.120
[Guest]: So you are all writing the same exam.

02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:17.640
[Guest]: All of you have the same dream, which is IAS, collector banna hai, laal batti, gaon mein

02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:22.400
[Guest]: jaake my baap bannege, log humare pyaar pakdenge, hum unko relief denge.

02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:26.320
[Guest]: And for various other things, somebody wants to contribute as a collector, somebody wants

02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:30.120
[Guest]: to have their dabba picked as a collector, doors open.

02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:33.360
[Guest]: But for various reasons, everyone wants IAS, right?

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:37.960
[Guest]: Or some people want IFS, which is for London mein wine peeenge.

02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:43.720
[Guest]: So again, not to belittle people's drivers, they are genuine, very good civil servants

02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:46.400
[Guest]: I know who have great reasons for wanting these things.

02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:47.400
[Guest]: I was one of them.

02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:50.440
[Guest]: I wanted IAS for that reason, contribution.

02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:54.920
[Guest]: But you have these 25 other services, which nobody else is thinking about, which all of

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:57.860
[Guest]: these people who want one service are going to fall into one of those buckets.

02:09:57.860 --> 02:10:03.040
[Guest]: So shuru mein hi uss job mein ek insaan aa raha hai, jise woh job chahiye hi nahi thi.

02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:06.560
[Guest]: For whom that job was never a dream, it was never a priority.

02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:10.560
[Guest]: And because it was never a dream, then not something that they wanted, they are often

02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:12.640
[Guest]: also not suited for that job.

02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:16.880
[Guest]: So you will have all sorts of people randomly falling in all different buckets.

02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:19.560
[Guest]: And it's a lot of chance, right?

02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:20.560
[Guest]: On that day.

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:24.520
[Guest]: Like I know a senior of mine who likes to say ki us din examiner ghar pe jagda karke

02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:27.880
[Guest]: aaye tha aur uski gobi kacchi bani thi aur uski upar fan nahi chal raha hai, isli tumhare

02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:30.960
[Guest]: marks kam aa gaye, kyuki wo gusse mein usne check kiya tumhara paper.

02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:37.280
[Guest]: Aur tumhara doosre peers ka, usne kisi tumhara peer ne ganda paper likha, but uska exam paper

02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:40.880
[Guest]: went to an evaluator who was in a great mood sitting in an air-conditioned room eating

02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:41.880
[Guest]: a pizza.

02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:43.280
[Guest]: So he's happy and he gave good marks.

02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:45.840
[Guest]: So it's a very, very luck-based system, right?

02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:48.560
[Guest]: Which is fair, theek hai, it's a large-scale exam.

02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:52.720
[Guest]: There will be an element of luck, like you said, in everything in life there is.

02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:57.120
[Guest]: But you have this luck-based system se people randomly falling in random buckets, right?

02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:00.640
[Guest]: And so now an accountant falls in the bucket of police officer.

02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:07.880
[Guest]: The person who didn't want that job is not, is not designed for that job physically, mentally,

02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:12.800
[Guest]: and is just not geared up for the requirements of being a police officer, is randomly put

02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:13.800
[Guest]: in that role now.

02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:18.960
[Guest]: There were people in my service who didn't know what email is, and they are now supposed

02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:20.560
[Guest]: to communicate for Government of India.

02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:25.720
[Guest]: Like I used to literally after hours teach extra classes to my peers ki chalo bhaiyon

02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:30.600
[Guest]: thodi baith jo ek email sikha deti ho, aapko ek cheez hoti hai, kyuki you are going to

02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:34.160
[Guest]: go and handle communication for this country.

02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:39.200
[Guest]: As my contribution in this, at this stage, I can't do much, but at least I can educate

02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:40.880
[Guest]: my peers about something.

02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:45.520
[Guest]: So these are people who never wanted to write, who have no interest to this day in writing,

02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:46.640
[Guest]: in communicating.

02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:52.280
[Guest]: But I was luckily someone who had a communication mindset who fell accidentally in this bucket.

02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:56.680
[Guest]: But plenty of people who had no inclination or desire to do this with their lives have

02:11:56.680 --> 02:11:58.400
[Guest]: fallen into this bucket.

02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:03.000
[Guest]: So that's why I said the forest service peers were a great experience for me because they

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:08.320
[Guest]: were people who wanted forest service, you know, they were zoology, biology, graduates,

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:12.900
[Guest]: they were people from the northeast who had grown up in forests and knew that economy

02:12:12.900 --> 02:12:17.320
[Guest]: of a forest, how that value chain works, how those communities function, what is the importance

02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:21.600
[Guest]: of protecting wildlife, what is a difference between a sandalwood tree and a neem tree,

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.760
[Guest]: which person like me has no idea.

02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:26.680
[Guest]: But I will never accidentally fall in the forest bucket because I didn't write that

02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:27.680
[Guest]: exam.

02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:30.640
[Guest]: They have fallen into that because they consciously chose to write that exam.

02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:34.420
[Guest]: So the first thing that I think this country needs to change big time is have separate

02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:36.420
[Guest]: exams for each service.

02:12:36.420 --> 02:12:41.720
[Guest]: If you are a person who wants to do asset liability, taxation, you should write the

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:42.720
[Guest]: IRS exam.

02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:47.040
[Guest]: If you're an English graduate, then don't write that IRS exam, you're not suited for

02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:50.840
[Guest]: it, you don't even want to do it, you won't be happy doing it and you'll do a bad job.

02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:53.480
[Guest]: So that's number one to me.

02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:57.080
[Guest]: Biggest flaw is this one gateway for multiple entries.

02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:01.800
[Guest]: And which is why people other than IAS, usme bhi log dhukhi hain, but other than IAS, zyadatar

02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:05.800
[Guest]: log are spending their life in grief and what ifs.

02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:11.480
[Guest]: What if I had got two more marks more in geography paper, then I would be there, not here.

02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:16.800
[Guest]: And it's unfair to that office that a person who has no inclination of being there, who

02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:21.440
[Guest]: doesn't take pride in that office, and who doesn't take the potential of that office

02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:25.720
[Guest]: and the responsibilities of that office seriously is sitting in that office for the next 30

02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:28.640
[Guest]: years, mind you, with no way of moving away.

02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:33.760
[Guest]: Skipping forward to the reason I quit was also this because I would see seniors who

02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:38.240
[Guest]: were 30 years, 35 years senior to me and still talking about marks.

02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:42.040
[Guest]: There was a, I remember ek INB secretary ka farewell tha.

02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:44.920
[Guest]: This is the other thing, ke secretary IAS banenge.

02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:49.680
[Guest]: So an IAS person who has spent their life in the INB ministry will never rise to the

02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:51.080
[Guest]: secretary of that ministry.

02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:55.320
[Guest]: The secretary will be someone who's come from rural development agriculture ministry.

02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:57.560
[Amit Varma]: So generalist over specialist always.

02:13:57.560 --> 02:13:58.560
[Guest]: Correct.

02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:02.140
[Guest]: So it's not even about, that's not the lens, the lens is IAS over everything, right.

02:14:02.140 --> 02:14:07.160
[Guest]: So that supremacy, that lobby has been very tightly controlled and will probably not change

02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:09.300
[Guest]: in our lifetimes even, I have low hopes.

02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:10.300
[Guest]: But that needs to change.

02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:14.000
[Guest]: You need to have people who are specialists working in those roles and rising to the top

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.680
[Guest]: in those roles so that they know the issues at the bottom.

02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:21.920
[Guest]: Anyway, so this INB secretary who was an IAS was retiring and I was one of the officers

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:22.920
[Guest]: in the ministry.

02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:24.560
[Guest]: So I was called for the farewell.

02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:29.040
[Guest]: Toh farewell, lunch wa gaira hua and then sir was asked to make a speech and in his

02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:34.920
[Guest]: speech he was basically, wo starts with those words of inspiration, the random stuff, but

02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:35.920
[Guest]: a usual stuff.

02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:40.560
[Guest]: But then ultimately after a while I realized this is a consolation speech he's giving

02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:45.840
[Guest]: because he's telling us that you should have pride in what you do, you should not

02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:50.720
[Guest]: take it to heart that you didn't make it and I was like, make it where for a second

02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:56.120
[Guest]: and then I realized he's talking still about, woh tumhare waha pe marks nahi aaye the acche,

02:14:56.120 --> 02:15:00.000
[Guest]: toh isliye ab is aadmi ko apne retirement ke din pe bhi wahi marks yaad aare hain and

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:06.000
[Guest]: even as an IAS he's giving us consolation and I see my seniors with their heads hanging,

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.200
[Guest]: taking that consolation and thinking haan amare saath hua toh bohot bura but you're

02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:12.080
[Guest]: right, maybe we should take heart in this.

02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:16.560
[Guest]: People who are living with such deep regret should not be in these offices, they are doing

02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:19.760
[Guest]: an injustice, a disservice to the office.

02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:23.880
[Guest]: And so I would see that, I mean I tried to, tried a lot to make change happen, tried a

02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:28.560
[Guest]: lot to reform things, but then reform would happen when it would come from the top.

02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:32.520
[Guest]: Like 2014, Modi government comes and says, social media karna hai, toh suddenly sabko

02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:33.520
[Guest]: karna hai.

02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:37.600
[Guest]: Usse pehle I was putting proposal pe proposal that we should have a more active presence

02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:42.000
[Guest]: on social media, nothing, no change, ye tum bachon ka kuch khel hai, we are not interested,

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.320
[Guest]: you youngsters only know, we don't know what this is.

02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:49.560
[Guest]: And fair point, you don't know, but that's not a good enough reason to not do something

02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:53.020
[Guest]: that is useful for the service for the country.

02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:57.000
[Guest]: But then when it came from the top, it happened and overnight everyone was on Twitter.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:02.680
[Guest]: So that's when I realized ki yaar, I'm just spending a lot of my productive years

02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:07.800
[Guest]: and energy and effort and passion into just pushing against a wall that's not going to

02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:09.240
[Guest]: move because of my push.

02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:18.160
[Guest]: So the job I was also in, after my training ended, I was, around that time was May 2014.

02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:22.560
[Guest]: And during my training itself, I had done these on-the-job training rotations.

02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:26.800
[Guest]: And in DD News, I had launched a campaign on sustainable urban transport, like from

02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:32.360
[Guest]: scratch I read up on the subject, I went and interviewed experts and I would take a camera

02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:34.720
[Guest]: team with me to shoot their interviews.

02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:39.880
[Guest]: And then I got funding from, allocated from DD News to, ki yeh karenge chaar hafte ka

02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:40.880
[Guest]: campaign.

02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:45.000
[Guest]: I personally got like Rahul Bose ko phone kar ko aake uska kahin se manager ka number

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.800
[Guest]: dhoond ke, got him as our host for the show.

02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:51.760
[Guest]: Got all these experts from various fields, talking about non-motorized transport, need

02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:57.520
[Guest]: for bicycle tracks on our roads, need for more buses instead of more metros.

02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:02.080
[Guest]: How highways are not going to solve the problem of traffic jams because that is like trying

02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:03.840
[Guest]: to put out a fire with petrol.

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:09.320
[Guest]: So, all of these concepts which are not obvious to most of us, I educated myself on them and

02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:11.920
[Guest]: then I worked on designing a campaign.

02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:16.360
[Guest]: And that caught the eye of one of my seniors, who was, once the new government came in in

02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:18.880
[Guest]: 2014, he was posted in the PMO.

02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:22.800
[Guest]: So, he said that I want these two-three young officers in my team.

02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:26.240
[Guest]: So, I was one of those people handpicked for this thing.

02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:30.080
[Guest]: And then I got posted in PIB in Prime Minister's office.

02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:34.280
[Guest]: So, basically handling PMO's publicity for PIB.

02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:39.040
[Guest]: So, those press releases I would write would be, Shri Narendra Modi went today to Madison

02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:42.080
[Guest]: Square Garden and delivered an address and yeh wo.

02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:46.960
[Guest]: So, it was a obviously very, very prestigious job and arguably the best job you can have.

02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:51.360
[Guest]: Actually, the best job you can have at that age and stage of your career in that service

02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:53.320
[Guest]: was what I got right out of academy.

02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:56.400
[Guest]: Actually, I wasn't even allowed to finish academy, they said we are picking you out

02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:57.400
[Guest]: of the process.

02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:00.120
[Guest]: Karne toh baaki training poori, tum aajao bahar.

02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:04.440
[Guest]: So, I was pulled out of the academy middle of my training and picked up for this.

02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:09.560
[Guest]: So, it was a huge honor, obviously, very, very prestigious and, but over time, what

02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:14.360
[Guest]: started happening was that I, we used to have this very hectic lifestyle, you know, get

02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:20.000
[Guest]: up at 4 a.m., 3 a.m. kyunki 4 a.m. tak office pohoshna hota hai and then you make a media

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:25.240
[Guest]: report for the Prime Minister, ke subah jab wo uthenge, toh wo kitni akbaare ek insaan

02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:26.720
[Guest]: padhega, unke paas time nahi hai.

02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:31.800
[Guest]: So, I would read 20 newspapers, Hindi, English, vernacular, put together news that is being

02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:36.200
[Guest]: written about the government, about the Prime Minister, about so and so ministry, about

02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:39.960
[Guest]: yesterday's event that happened, what people are saying about his speech, things like that,

02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:45.080
[Guest]: like make a full digest that goes to the PM and with their morning chai, the Prime Minister

02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:46.080
[Guest]: reads this.

02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:50.040
[Guest]: So, this has been happening forever, it's not new to this government, but I was like

02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:51.040
[Amit Varma]: in that.

02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:52.800
[Amit Varma]: Now, it's a physical digest of everything.

02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:56.120
[Guest]: No, it's a like a, it's a word document, you write like 20 pages.

02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:57.560
[Amit Varma]: And then they print it out.

02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:01.000
[Guest]: And then they print it out and serve it to him with his morning chai.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.600
[Amit Varma]: So, you got to be there at 4 in the morning doing this.

02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:04.600
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:06.120
[Guest]: So, by the time he wakes up, it has to be ready.

02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:08.680
[Guest]: So, that was like a very, and shift based system.

02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:13.240
[Guest]: So, there is that morning shift, then there's a day shift, and then there's a evening shift.

02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:15.920
[Guest]: And then with this PM, he did a lot of international travel.

02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:20.680
[Guest]: So, sometimes you're up at 2 a.m. tweeting about something because he's talking in Madison

02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:21.680
[Amit Varma]: Square Garden.

02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:23.200
[Unknown]: Did you write his tweets?

02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:24.200
[Guest]: Not his tweets, PIB.

02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:25.200
[Amit Varma]: PIB tweets.

02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:26.200
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:27.200
[Guest]: So, PIB underscore India.

02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:34.600
[Guest]: I was not in the PM, I was in PIB handling PMO publicity, so some distance was there

02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:35.600
[Guest]: for better or for worse.

02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:37.040
[Guest]: I had that job.

02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:45.880
[Guest]: And so, that job, the analogy I use is like, you know, if you had a nuclear power button,

02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:50.960
[Guest]: nuclear bomb button, and you had to pick a person to be in charge of that button, you

02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:55.320
[Guest]: would pick probably the best person you can think of, the most competent person.

02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:56.760
[Guest]: But think about now their life.

02:19:56.760 --> 02:19:57.760
[Guest]: What is their job description?

02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:02.960
[Guest]: It is very high stress, there is no scope to make a mistake, there has to be immediate

02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:05.680
[Guest]: action to any issues that come up.

02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:08.560
[Guest]: But ultimately, they're just sitting and looking at a button, right?

02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:10.400
[Guest]: So, their life is going to be boring.

02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:14.640
[Amit Varma]: No, I would love that job because I would decide mentally, that I'm never pressing the

02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:15.640
[Guest]: button.

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:20.440
[Amit Varma]: But it's like, you know, sometimes the button gets pressed, then you have to quickly unpress

02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:21.440
[Guest]: it.

02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:22.440
[Guest]: Something like that.

02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:24.320
[Guest]: There is quick action required on multiple fronts.

02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:25.760
[Guest]: So, it's a busy job.

02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:28.240
[Guest]: It's not a job where you're reading a book.

02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:33.520
[Guest]: It is a job which is hectic, but it has the ultimate nuance of it is that you're in charge

02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:36.040
[Guest]: of not letting disaster happen here, right?

02:20:36.040 --> 02:20:39.000
[Guest]: So, speed and accuracy were two things that were needed in that job.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:42.400
[Guest]: So, obviously, they picked the best people they could think of for that job.

02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:46.520
[Guest]: But at the end of the day, the job for me was very, very passive.

02:20:46.520 --> 02:21:02.040
[Guest]: So, after a point, it becomes a job that you can pretty much do on autopilot.

02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:06.880
[Guest]: So, over time, I felt like I'm not really, there's no challenge to it beyond a point.

02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:10.320
[Guest]: My brain is not developing, I'm not learning anything new.

02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:12.600
[Guest]: It's the same thing that I have to do over and over again.

02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:14.360
[Guest]: There is zero scope for mistakes.

02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:20.560
[Guest]: It's always urgent, because always right now, PM is making a statement at 8pm, so it's very

02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:21.560
[Guest]: high stress.

02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:26.040
[Guest]: It is any hour of day or night, 24-7, he's working, so you're working.

02:21:26.040 --> 02:21:29.240
[Guest]: And then ultimately, you're not really learning anything new beyond a point.

02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:34.080
[Guest]: So, I mean, I would get, highs are there that sometimes a call would come from PM, that

02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:38.520
[Guest]: PM has read your report and was praising you, that this is very well written, this is how

02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:39.520
[Guest]: officers should write.

02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:45.320
[Guest]: So, then you get a high that, wow, he praised me personally, I wrote something that was

02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:46.320
[Amit Varma]: in his hands.

02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:47.680
[Amit Varma]: Did you ever meet him?

02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:52.080
[Guest]: I was in the same room as him often because of events and all, but not one-to-one, never

02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:53.080
[Guest]: met him.

02:21:53.080 --> 02:21:57.800
[Guest]: But events and all, every event that he did in Delhi, we would have to attend and immediately

02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:01.040
[Guest]: again write press releases and do media management and all.

02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:07.080
[Guest]: But anyway, so, it was a very, very, like I said, prestigious and honor to be given

02:22:07.080 --> 02:22:08.080
[Guest]: that job.

02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:11.480
[Guest]: So, ultimately, I felt like I was mentally decaying.

02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:17.280
[Guest]: And also, in parallel was this thing happening of me trying to keep my brain alive by pushing

02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:21.000
[Guest]: for these reforms in the system, right, which I said were going nowhere.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:26.720
[Guest]: Because I saw that it's not, self-esteem is so low of the service itself.

02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:31.080
[Guest]: And that's true of many services which are not IAS, I mean, some people have like, thodasa,

02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:36.920
[Guest]: I think IRS IT has a little, police obviously has pride, but beyond a point, other services

02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:42.680
[Guest]: often feel like we are the word that is used, IAS allied service, that we can't say IAS,

02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:45.960
[Guest]: we will say IAS allied to ourselves.

02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:48.720
[Guest]: That itself shows a little bit of, you know, low self-esteem.

02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:53.120
[Amit Varma]: It's like people who live in Juhu, Barsova, Link Road, which is actually Andheri, they'll

02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:57.280
[Guest]: say we live in upper Juhu, so it's like allied Juhu, you could say.

02:22:57.280 --> 02:22:58.280
[Guest]: Correct.

02:22:58.280 --> 02:22:59.280
[Guest]: Exactly.

02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:03.560
[Guest]: So, I mean, that, so that, that itself shows that there is lack of pride in what you are,

02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:06.800
[Guest]: where you are, and that shows in all your work also.

02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:10.280
[Guest]: So ultimately, there was like a corridor in Shastri Bhavan, and I could see my future

02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:13.280
[Guest]: for the next 30 years, that first I am in this room, then I will go to the next room,

02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:17.360
[Guest]: then to the next room, then end of the corridor, there is a palace of the senior boss, my life

02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:18.360
[Guest]: will end there.

02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:20.760
[Guest]: So it was like very depressing, that thought.

02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:24.480
[Amit Varma]: And there are some, there's some intern will come to you saying, let us reform the services

02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:25.480
[Amit Varma]: like this.

02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:30.880
[Guest]: And you will be like, if I had scored more than 2 marks in geography, then I wouldn't

02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:37.000
[Guest]: be in this room, and I wouldn't be listening to that stupid person who says, we'll change

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:38.000
[Guest]: the world by tweeting.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:41.400
[Guest]: So anyway, so yeah, I mean, all of those factors kind of combined, and I felt like it was not

02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:44.520
[Guest]: the best place for me anymore.

02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:49.200
[Guest]: And the interesting thing is that when I decided to quit, most of my seniors were very supportive

02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:51.640
[Guest]: of it, they were even enthusiastic of it.

02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:55.440
[Guest]: Some of them would even message me, to this day, some of them messaged me that you took

02:23:55.440 --> 02:24:00.120
[Guest]: such a courageous step that we could never take, and I wish at your age I had done this.

02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:05.560
[Guest]: And then I had, of course, an exit interview with our MOS, who was Mr. Rajvatar Singh Rathore.

02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:11.000
[Guest]: And then the minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley, he signs off finally on your resignation.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.960
[Guest]: And then, uske baad, bye bye.

02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:16.720
[Guest]: There were some people also who got very offended by my decision.

02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:21.240
[Guest]: And again, I felt like that showed a bit of low self-esteem when you are offended by somebody

02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:26.880
[Guest]: else's life decision about themselves that, you know, it's like, if I say that, I, Amit,

02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:29.360
[Guest]: I started a podcast, now I'm ending it and you feel offended.

02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:32.160
[Guest]: Aise kaise tum podcast end kar doge?

02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:33.440
[Guest]: What does that say about me?

02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:35.240
[Guest]: Are you saying that my life choice is wrong?

02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:38.560
[Guest]: You know, that's the sort of place that this comes from.

02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:43.400
[Guest]: So, I've had also seniors who would make me sit in their room and not sign my file because

02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:47.360
[Guest]: I used to physically go with the file, ki mujhe nikalna hai because I have another job

02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:48.960
[Guest]: lined up to join.

02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:53.040
[Guest]: And please yeh sign kar do, I used to physically go from office to office with my resignation

02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:54.040
[Guest]: file.

02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:56.160
[Guest]: So, I used to get these two extreme opposite reactions.

02:24:56.160 --> 02:25:00.240
[Guest]: One was so much pride, full support, I wish I had done this.

02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:03.640
[Guest]: And the other was, how dare you, tumhain himmat kaise hoi?

02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:04.960
[Guest]: What do you think of yourself?

02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:08.760
[Guest]: And you know, like, really personal stuff like that, I'm like, sir, just sign the file,

02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:12.120
[Guest]: I've never met you before, I don't intend to meet you again.

02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:14.280
[Guest]: Why do I matter to your life so much?

02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:17.480
[Guest]: I am a makhi, just haath maaron, nikalon kamre se baar.

02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:18.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeh kaise log hai?

02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:21.360
[Amit Varma]: Kabhi kabhi mujhe lagta hai ki matlab inke dimaag mein kya chalta hoga?

02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:27.440
[Amit Varma]: What are the sort of narratives brewing in their mind that they can react the way they

02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:28.440
[Amit Varma]: do?

02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:29.440
[Amit Varma]: Great.

02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:32.120
[Amit Varma]: So, we've sort of reached, you know, a critical turning point in your life, where you turn

02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:34.720
[Amit Varma]: your back on the evil Indian state.

02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:36.600
[Guest]: Are evil mat bol raha hai.

02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:41.040
[Guest]: I know I probably come across as really ungrateful and there are probably civil servants listening

02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:45.360
[Amit Varma]: to this who are feeling like, kya, what is this ungrateful, thankless gal?

02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:48.760
[Amit Varma]: Ek toh yeh main bol raha hoon aur doosra main kya bol raha hoon ki whatever my judgment

02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:52.680
[Amit Varma]: on the state is, I never extend that judgment to the people working within it.

02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:58.480
[Amit Varma]: I still have many good friends, Salil included, who are part of the Indian state and they

02:25:58.480 --> 02:25:59.480
[Amit Varma]: are wonderful people.

02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:00.840
[Amit Varma]: But the state is what it is.

02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:06.440
[Amit Varma]: But is baat pe ek choti si break lete hain aur break ke baad we'll talk about writing

02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:11.080
[Amit Varma]: and womaning, the two big Ws.

02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:14.120
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it?

02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:15.440
[Amit Varma]: Well, I'd love to help you.

02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:20.400
[Amit Varma]: Since April 2020, I have taught 20 cohorts of my online course, The Art of Clear Writing.

02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:23.560
[Amit Varma]: An online community has now sprung up of all my past students.

[Amit Varma]: We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students and vibrant community

02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:56.720
[Amit Varma]: Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard

02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:00.280
[Amit Varma]: and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills.

02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:03.000
[Amit Varma]: I can help you.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:04.360
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:08.240
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with the famous Mahima Vashisht once upon a time you'll remember people joined

02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:12.000
[Amit Varma]: coaching classes because Mahima Vashisht yaha aati hai.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.520
[Amit Varma]: Abhi log scene unseen sunenge Mahima Vashisht yaha aati hai.

02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:22.560
[Amit Varma]: So you know, you sort of left government for the reasons you sort of described with great

02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:23.840
[Amit Varma]: eloquence.

02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:29.120
[Amit Varma]: But after that, before you kind of came to where you are, you spent a few years working

02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:30.800
[Amit Varma]: with Swachh Bharat as well.

02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:34.920
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about how you kind of got into that, what that journey was like, and so on

02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:36.760
[Guest]: and so forth.

02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:41.560
[Guest]: So like I said, I joined the government with a certain contributive aim in mind and I was

02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:44.920
[Guest]: somehow feeling that it was not getting fulfilled.

02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:50.120
[Guest]: So at least the results were not proportionate to the efforts and it seemed at some point

02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:53.280
[Guest]: that my efforts were actually meaningless in the larger scheme of things.

02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:56.920
[Guest]: The country was going where it would go, it's not like the civil services were going to

02:27:56.920 --> 02:28:00.400
[Guest]: lose out on a big thing if Mahima Vashisht was there or not.

02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:05.160
[Guest]: So with that, again, the same aim in mind of having an impact, I decided that maybe

02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:08.880
[Guest]: you know, I'll try my luck in the development sector.

02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:14.320
[Guest]: And I fortunately, around the time when I was contemplating and going through that inner

02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:21.240
[Guest]: turmoil of to stay or not to stay, I also, I started talking to friends and peers about

02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:26.360
[Guest]: the development sector and I found out that Tata Trusts was, had just been rebranded as

02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:27.360
[Guest]: Tata Trusts.

02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:33.120
[Guest]: So earlier they were these Jamshedji Trust, JRD Trust, very like some 20-25 trusts left

02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:36.960
[Guest]: by various people in the Tata lineage.

02:28:36.960 --> 02:28:43.400
[Guest]: And Mr. Ratan Tata was, had now recently co-branded them as one umbrella Tata Trusts as the brand

02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:44.800
[Guest]: and everything is under it.

02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:48.640
[Guest]: So there was a lot of reorganization happening because each trust had its own mandate, its

02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:54.240
[Guest]: own leadership and people were brought together, lot of change management happening inside

02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:56.400
[Guest]: and they wanted to bring some young blood also.

02:28:56.400 --> 02:29:01.320
[Guest]: So they were looking for people to hire and coming from a government background also gave

02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:05.160
[Guest]: me a certain edge, so I was offered a position in that team.

02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:10.160
[Guest]: So I literally just, I think my resignation got accepted on 30th November and 1st December

02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:11.800
[Guest]: I joined Tata Trust.

02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:20.000
[Guest]: So for a few months I was still figuring out my place, I was working with some dual leadership,

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.040
[Guest]: one boss in Delhi, one boss in Bombay, it was working, not working, kuch kuch.

02:29:24.040 --> 02:29:31.240
[Guest]: Then one day the CEO of trusts called me and he said that there is a new leadership in

02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:36.400
[Guest]: the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and they work on Swachh Bharat Mission and

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:41.480
[Guest]: they are looking for the, essentially there was a new secretary and he's been brought

02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:45.600
[Guest]: as a lateral hire, he's not come up the IAS ladder.

02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:51.160
[Guest]: Although he was ex-IAS, he left, went out and worked in the World Bank in the US and

02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:55.160
[Guest]: various other countries and now he's been brought in laterally to lead the Swachh Bharat

02:29:55.160 --> 02:30:00.520
[Guest]: Mission and he, because for him coming back to the government is a change, he wants people

02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:04.440
[Guest]: to come manage his office and help him set things up.

02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:08.240
[Guest]: So jao zara ek do hafta unki help kar do because you are familiar with the government system

02:30:08.240 --> 02:30:11.400
[Guest]: and then you can come back and resume what you are doing here.

02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:17.800
[Guest]: So like theek hai, I went, three of us were asked to go and he had said I want some youngsters

02:30:17.800 --> 02:30:24.800
[Guest]: and one was a very young colleague, another was a fresh IIM graduate and third was, I

02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:27.680
[Guest]: was the senior most in that team.

02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:32.080
[Guest]: And the three of us went and we sent our CV and everything to him and I was very impressed

02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:35.280
[Guest]: that this is a secretary who replies to email first of all.

02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:40.000
[Guest]: Literally, a secretary who checks his own email is a very rare species in government

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:41.000
[Guest]: of India.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:44.480
[Guest]: And I remember I emailed him at night and within half an hour I got a response from

02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:48.480
[Guest]: him and he had clearly like got it on his phone, which is an accomplishment again, email

02:30:48.480 --> 02:30:49.800
[Guest]: on their phone.

02:30:49.800 --> 02:30:56.320
[Guest]: Not have a PS jo kamre ke bhaar baithe aur Monday ko print out lekar aaye sir ye email

02:30:56.320 --> 02:30:59.120
[Guest]: ka, not that, so very impressed.

02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:05.360
[Guest]: And then, so we went in and so he was a career sanitation person because he had worked in

02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:10.280
[Guest]: the World Bank as in the sanitation sector and then he was clearly very knowledgeable

02:31:10.280 --> 02:31:16.360
[Guest]: about the sector and he had very clear ideas on where he wanted to take things.

02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:20.840
[Guest]: And basically Swachh Bharat Mission was as we know launched on 2nd October 2014 and this

02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:26.000
[Guest]: is happening in March 2016 and by this time, if you look at the data, the coverage hasn't

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000
[Guest]: moved much.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:31.160
[Guest]: So, the sanitation coverage of India at the time of independence was like 1%.

02:31:31.160 --> 02:31:37.040
[Guest]: So, 1% of Indians used the toilet and had access to a toilet even.

02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:42.600
[Guest]: Then over the years, still various sanitation programs happened in the country, Nirmal Bharat

02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:46.680
[Guest]: Abhyaan, usse pehle Total Sanitation Campaign, usse pehle kuch aur kuch aur.

02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:53.200
[Guest]: And over the years, coverage had come up only to 38% when as of Swachh Bharat launch.

02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:58.760
[Guest]: So, now the mandate given by the Prime Minister is paath saal mein ODF India, which is Open

02:31:58.760 --> 02:32:03.360
[Guest]: Defecation Free India and they had set themselves a very high bar of 100% coverage.

02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:08.800
[Guest]: So, I mean in some countries, ODF, Open Defecation Free is also defined when you achieve 70%

02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:14.640
[Guest]: coverage that okay, not enough people are anymore going out in the open to cause serious

02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:17.360
[Guest]: risk of diseases and infectious diseases.

02:32:17.360 --> 02:32:21.880
[Guest]: So, this is the, some threshold they decide, everybody agrees on ki haan, yahan tak pahunch

02:32:21.880 --> 02:32:23.720
[Guest]: pehle toh we'll call it ODF.

02:32:23.720 --> 02:32:27.680
[Guest]: India mein they went full ke hum dekh lenge, 100%.

02:32:27.680 --> 02:32:29.720
[Amit Varma]: 100 kya, 110% karenge.

02:32:29.720 --> 02:32:30.720
[Guest]: 110 karenge.

02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:35.040
[Guest]: Toh policy likte time na, hum log bahut ambitious ho jate hain, mission launch ho gaye, we'll

02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:37.040
[Guest]: call it a mission not a scheme, right.

02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:41.280
[Guest]: So, these things, uss saam mein hum full josh mein aake 100% bol diye hain.

02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:46.800
[Guest]: Aur ab hum 38 se abhi tak 50 pe bhi nahi paunch paaye, 2 saal nikal gaye hain.

02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:53.040
[Guest]: So, that was the condition in which he had taken over and Mr. Parmeshwar Nair, by the

02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:58.080
[Guest]: way, his name I should have taken before, so he was, so he was very clear ke I am going

02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:04.160
[Guest]: to meet this target and the career bureaucrats before me have not taken this seriously because

02:33:04.160 --> 02:33:07.920
[Guest]: they've been like, dekho, first of all, sanitation is a state subject, toh hum baithe hain haan

02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:11.960
[Guest]: Delhi mein states ko, jab karna hoga kar lenge.

02:33:11.960 --> 02:33:15.560
[Guest]: Jab funding ka request aayega, hum sign kar denge file, toh ho gaya humara kaam.

02:33:15.560 --> 02:33:19.640
[Guest]: So that was the attitude before him, which is why we were where we were.

02:33:19.640 --> 02:33:24.400
[Guest]: So his thing was ke nahi, I have, I have been brought in for, on a contract.

02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:26.440
[Guest]: This is my main aim.

02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:31.560
[Guest]: Even if my contract gets extended, mujhe 2019, 2nd October ko ODF India chahiye hi chahiye,

02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:32.720
[Guest]: karna hi karna hai.

02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:37.000
[Guest]: So then, and he wanted his team to have the same enthusiasm, which is why he brought in

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:41.760
[Guest]: fresh blood from outside because he was like, the current setup is of that mentality and

02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:47.720
[Guest]: so he did a lot of transfers and brought in new people and in the government service also.

02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:53.080
[Guest]: And so over the years, then he was very, we were quite aggressive and like we would call

02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:58.920
[Guest]: up collectors and be like, ye percent pe kyu ho, ye person se aage wo percent ho rachi

02:33:58.920 --> 02:33:59.920
[Guest]: hai.

02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:04.520
[Guest]: And I was working a lot more on the communication side of things because I had that background

02:34:04.520 --> 02:34:06.000
[Guest]: of government communication.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:09.400
[Guest]: So I worked a lot on campaigns for Swachh Bharat Mission.

02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:14.240
[Guest]: So you might have seen Darwaza Bandh, Amitabh Bachchan ka campaign, which is about ke toilet

02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:17.200
[Guest]: ka darwaza bandh karo, essentially.

02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:21.480
[Guest]: And there was a bit of gender that I had brought in in that, lengths that I had brought in

02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:22.480
[Guest]: there also.

02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:27.840
[Guest]: So there was, there is this instance that I want to highlight to kind of like give an

02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:30.840
[Guest]: example of the kind of work I was trying to do.

02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:33.800
[Guest]: So Nirmal Bharat mein, there were these ads, right?

02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:35.640
[Guest]: Ek Vidya Balan ka ad hota tha.

02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:40.240
[Guest]: By the way, full love, I am a big fan of Vidya Balan, but woh jo ad tha, that had some issues.

02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:45.960
[Guest]: Toh ad mein, she was a school teacher type, chashme wali lady, who goes into a village.

02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:49.200
[Guest]: Typical government ad ki gaon wale beb koof hote hain aur shahir wale aa ke unko samjhate

02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:51.120
[Guest]: hain ki jeevan aise jeena chahiye tumhe.

02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:52.120
[Guest]: Right?

02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:56.000
[Guest]: We will impart our urban wisdom and teach them how to live their life.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:59.040
[Guest]: So that was the typical model which all government ads have followed.

02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:00.180
[Guest]: Usme bhi ye hi tha.

02:35:00.180 --> 02:35:03.760
[Guest]: And then this ad is called Dulhan ki Vidai, aisa kuch naam hai iska.

02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:08.800
[Guest]: So the ad mein kya hai ki ek shadi ho rahi hai aur dulha dulhan baitha hu hai mandap

02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:14.640
[Guest]: mein, saas baitha hai side mein, ladke ki maa and ladki bolti hai mujhe paani peena hai.

02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:18.760
[Guest]: Toh koi paani ka glass laata hai aur woh ghoongat pehna hua hai usne, lamba, toh ghoongat utha

02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:20.480
[Guest]: ke paani peeti hai.

02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:25.800
[Guest]: And then the saas is immediately like, ishara karti hai ki neeche karo, ghoongat neeche.

02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:29.800
[Guest]: And then, so Vidya Balan notices this with a critical eye.

02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:35.520
[Guest]: And then later she says ki bahu ko shauchale jaana hai.

02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:40.200
[Guest]: Toh saas bolti ki shauchale kahan humare hain toh hum aisi bahar jaate hain.

02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:46.040
[Guest]: Toh woh bolti ki bahu fir toh tum ghoongat bhi khol do, kyuki ek taraf toh inko tumhara

02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:49.160
[Guest]: paani peene ke ghoongat uthana bhi gawara nahi hai, dusri taraf ye chahate hai ki tum

02:35:49.160 --> 02:35:51.400
[Guest]: bahar jaa ke khule mein shauch karo.

02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:56.640
[Guest]: Toh, I mean, that ad is supposed to say use a toilet obviously, but it's also in a way

02:35:56.640 --> 02:36:01.720
[Guest]: saying that aur toh ka ghoongat pehna is fair as long as there's a toilet at home, rakho

02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:04.320
[Guest]: unhe ghoongat, bandi wana ke, right?

02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:08.640
[Guest]: So it's not thinking that, but it is unintentionally saying that.

02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:12.920
[Guest]: So for me, a big part of it was also that there is this entire narrative about women

02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:13.920
[Guest]: being victims.

02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:20.160
[Guest]: Ke the victimhood of women, hamari mataon aur bhehnaon ko toilet nahi milta hai, bechari

02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:25.960
[Guest]: subhe tak rok ke rakti hain, bahot peeda hoti hai, bahot dukh milta hai unhe, unki izzat

02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:30.720
[Guest]: hume bachani hai, toh this mataon bhehnaon narrative really irritates me, first of all,

02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:34.800
[Guest]: because you should respect people because they're people, not because you have relatives

02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:35.800
[Guest]: of that gender.

02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:36.800
[Guest]: Right?

02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:40.360
[Guest]: Nobody says ki iss aadmi ka murder hone se rakho kyunki humare bhaiyon aur baapon ki

02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:41.360
[Guest]: raksha karne hai.

02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:42.360
[Guest]: No one says that.

02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:45.920
[Guest]: But aur toh yaar, there's always a mataon bhehnaon narrative.

02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:49.960
[Guest]: So that was one thing that I didn't like, and also there was painting of women as these

02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.480
[Guest]: passive victims who are sitting at home waiting to be rescued by the men.

02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:58.640
[Guest]: So I mean, my sense was that rural women have far more agency and they are able to even

02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:03.240
[Guest]: lead this movement because their incentives are aligned, it is in their interest.

02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:07.640
[Guest]: They don't want to go out and get assaulted by men in the dark in the fields because they

02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:08.640
[Guest]: went outside.

02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:13.360
[Guest]: And there's all sorts of things, there's animal attacks, there's children being kidnapped.

02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:21.040
[Guest]: I think there was that rape in one UP district where these girls had gone out basically for

02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:26.000
[Guest]: open defecation and it became a very, there were these very violent images that came out

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:31.040
[Guest]: also later about how their bodies were hung from a tree or something.

02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:34.920
[Amit Varma]: Sonia Falero wrote a book about it called The Good Girls and I had an episode with her

02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:36.680
[Unknown]: on this as well.

02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:37.680
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, absolutely.

02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:38.680
[Guest]: Right.

02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:43.320
[Guest]: So obviously, it is in the interest of women, in greater interest of women, because they

02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:45.680
[Guest]: stand much more to lose their suffering much more.

02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:49.000
[Guest]: But that doesn't mean that they are going to be passive victims sitting at home waiting

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:50.680
[Guest]: to be rescued by their men.

02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:55.480
[Guest]: They can also lead this movement mostly because also they are mothers and they know that when

02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:58.160
[Guest]: their children fall ill, how it affects their children.

02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:04.400
[Guest]: And at this point, as a mother, you have this drive, this agency to protect your child.

02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:07.280
[Guest]: And if nothing else, not to protect themselves, at least to protect their children, they will

02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:10.480
[Guest]: want toilets and they can become champions of the movement.

02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:14.720
[Guest]: So that was the lens with which I wanted to communicate about Swachh Bharat.

02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:17.800
[Guest]: And so we got Anushka Sharma as the brand ambassador.

02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:22.480
[Guest]: So while everybody was very gung-ho about Amitabh Bachchan and very, very cool of Mr.

02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:26.800
[Guest]: Bachchan, he did it for free as he does with most government campaigns, and every brand

02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:29.400
[Guest]: ambassador does it pro bono.

02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:33.120
[Guest]: But then I wanted one woman ambassador who talks about this message also.

02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:38.000
[Guest]: And so there's an ad of Darwaza Band campaign featuring Anushka Sharma where you see women

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:42.600
[Guest]: who are, you know, gheraing around a man who's going with a mug outside in the jungle.

02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:45.880
[Guest]: And there's these wives who have chained the mugs to the toilet.

02:38:45.880 --> 02:38:49.520
[Guest]: So the man tries to yank the mug away to go in the fields and he's not able to.

02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:52.960
[Guest]: And then two men look at each other that both our wives have chained and they're saying,

02:38:52.960 --> 02:38:54.720
[Guest]: please go use the toilet.

02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:58.160
[Guest]: Because we were also finding the data was showing that even once you build a toilet,

02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:01.280
[Guest]: it is the able-bodied young men who are the last to adopt.

02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:05.360
[Guest]: The senior citizens will adopt, the differently abled will adopt, children will do it, women

02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:07.980
[Guest]: will do it, but the young men are the problem area.

02:39:07.980 --> 02:39:12.560
[Guest]: So I said, women are not the problem, men are here the problem, so let's target men

02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:17.360
[Guest]: as the target segment which needs to change their behavior instead of saying, bichari

02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:19.120
[Guest]: aurat ki izzat bachalo.

02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:22.480
[Guest]: Because that messaging also means you build a toilet and then you go out in the jungle

02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:26.320
[Guest]: because you built it for your wife, not for yourself.

02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:28.540
[Guest]: And open defecation is one thing which affects everyone.

02:39:28.540 --> 02:39:33.480
[Guest]: It's not that I went out in the field and so only my health is affected because ultimately

02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:35.960
[Guest]: it's going to spread diseases which will come to everyone's house.

02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:37.660
[Guest]: So it's a community-wide effort.

02:39:37.660 --> 02:39:42.440
[Guest]: If even one person is going out, that was the message at least we said behind 100% coverage

02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:45.640
[Guest]: that even if one person goes out, your health is affected.

02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:48.440
[Guest]: And then there was a lot of learning around this sector.

02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:53.680
[Guest]: I remember the openness with which in that ministry we used to say the word tatti after

02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:54.680
[Guest]: a while.

02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:58.120
[Guest]: For the first time I remember there was this expert brought in who would keep saying the

02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:01.920
[Guest]: word tatti, tatti and I was giggling behind, I had to stand behind a colleague because

02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:05.640
[Guest]: I couldn't stop giggling and I thought it was unprofessional, but then again no one's

02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:09.080
[Guest]: heard of this talk in a boardroom setting.

02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:14.120
[Guest]: But it was a lot of fun, it was a lot of learning about again, you know, real issues of real

02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:20.200
[Guest]: India and how these issues are cross-cutting, they affect your family health, your finances.

02:40:20.200 --> 02:40:25.640
[Guest]: Because for a poor family, if a person who's earning falls ill x times a year, that much

02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:30.920
[Guest]: time of income doesn't come in, plus expenses of healthcare, women's agency to go out and

02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:34.480
[Guest]: work is limited if children are constantly falling ill in the house.

02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:39.200
[Guest]: So all of these things are interlinked with one little cause, which seems very banal at

02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:41.680
[Guest]: the outset, kya hai ek toilet bana do.

02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:45.160
[Guest]: So it was a great learning experience, five years.

02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:51.160
[Guest]: So I was there till 2020 and yeah, I mean, we declared India ODF and all the reality

02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:52.720
[Guest]: is obviously different.

02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:57.200
[Guest]: I mean, the National Family Health Survey recently came out and said it's not ODF, but

02:40:57.200 --> 02:40:58.200
[Guest]: that's beside the point.

02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:02.720
[Guest]: I think a lot of, the mission gets a lot of flack for this because we trapped ourselves

02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:06.880
[Guest]: into the narrative of ODF India karna hai, but that's not really the point.

02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:13.000
[Guest]: The point is that nowhere in the history of mankind, of humankind, has there been a government

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:17.320
[Guest]: program that has led to this much change in sanitation coverage of this many number of

02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:18.320
[Guest]: people.

02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:23.720
[Guest]: So at the time we began, 650 million people, Indians would go out and defecate in the open

02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:25.200
[Guest]: and basically 1 billion in the world.

02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:29.120
[Guest]: So every second person defecating outside in the morning was an Indian.

02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:33.520
[Guest]: So that was the extent of the problem at that time and even if we've not solved it 100%,

02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:39.900
[Guest]: we've solved it 70%, 80%, it's something to be applauded, it's something to be celebrated.

02:41:39.900 --> 02:41:47.560
[Guest]: So the narrative of 100% versus other, well, not 100% is not the point which should be

02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:49.720
[Guest]: debated, but it is worth celebrating.

02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:54.000
[Guest]: I mean, whatever is your politics and I also have opinions on the politics of this government,

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:58.000
[Guest]: but this mission has been an unqualified success in my view.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:03.160
[Guest]: If you look at it that way about the number of lives it has touched and improved forever.

02:42:03.160 --> 02:42:08.680
[Amit Varma]: And one, you know, even if one opposes ODL, we can still support ODF, ODL being audio

02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:09.680
[Amit Varma]: leader of course.

02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:14.480
[Unknown]: Yeah, you looked a little stunned there.

02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:19.120
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, ODL and ODF, but you know, it's also worth underscoring that that little point

02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:24.360
[Amit Varma]: you made that, you know, open defecation affects everyone and an illness can be of great consequence

02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:25.720
[Amit Varma]: to a poor family.

02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:32.680
[Amit Varma]: And I don't think we city elites really understand how devastating a small illness can be, you

02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:37.320
[Amit Varma]: know, I think economists use a term, I think welfare shocks, that essentially, you know,

02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:41.840
[Amit Varma]: an illness can lead to a welfare shock in the sense that you can actually fall back

02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:47.160
[Amit Varma]: into poverty, and then coming out can take another generation, you know, a slow movement

02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:50.240
[Amit Varma]: upwards can suddenly reverse so hard.

02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:54.880
[Amit Varma]: And you know, just so many people in cities, honestly, if they have a medical emergency,

02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:57.600
[Amit Varma]: even they themselves will go broke in a day, right?

02:42:57.600 --> 02:43:01.640
[Amit Varma]: So when you think of the poorest of the poor, it's just way worse, it can be devastating

02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:03.160
[Amit Varma]: and something like this has a great impact.

02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:07.680
[Amit Varma]: I'd done an episode on Swachh Bharat India a long time back with Shruti Rajgopalan, where

02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:12.840
[Amit Varma]: the fundamental point she was making is that some of it was posturing in the sense that

02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:17.600
[Amit Varma]: sure you build the toilets and you put the commodes in, you know, whatever, but the underlying

02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:19.480
[Amit Varma]: drainage system wasn't there.

02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:24.000
[Amit Varma]: And because the underlying drainage system wasn't there, the caste system got perpetuated

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:28.760
[Amit Varma]: because you inevitably have people from the lower caste forced to then come and take the

02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:30.000
[Amit Varma]: refuse away.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:33.520
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, a lot of the change was cosmetic, because people still kept going out.

02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:36.000
[Amit Varma]: I think this episode would have been in 2018 or something.

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.800
[Amit Varma]: So possibly, you know, you were there till 2020.

02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:44.280
[Amit Varma]: So maybe you guys managed to, you know, do something about the deeper underlying issues.

02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:45.280
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:49.200
[Guest]: So, first of all, there is no sewage network in a rural area.

02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:53.180
[Guest]: It's too partially populated to justify the cost of laying down sewage pipelines.

02:43:53.180 --> 02:43:57.520
[Guest]: And it's too dynamic because new households are coming up every now and then, when one

02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:01.120
[Guest]: family, two sons are separated, two houses are built suddenly, right.

02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:03.040
[Guest]: So it's a moving target.

02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:08.160
[Guest]: So building a sewage system is impractical in most rural parts of India.

02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:12.880
[Guest]: So what we did have was a twin-pit toilet system, which is that under the toilet only,

02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:15.160
[Guest]: under the ground, there is a system.

02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:17.120
[Guest]: And the system is that there are two pits.

02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:23.720
[Guest]: So first all the waste flows into one pit, it fills up and the pit has a mitti ka bottom.

02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:29.320
[Guest]: So that pit fills up, you kind of just call your mistri and switch the drainage to the

02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:30.440
[Guest]: other pit.

02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:33.680
[Guest]: And that one pit fills up takes five years.

02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:37.320
[Guest]: And then the second pit filling up will take five years, utti der mein this first pit would

02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:41.660
[Guest]: have leached down into the ground and would have composted.

02:44:41.660 --> 02:44:46.160
[Guest]: And in an ideal well-constructed twin-pit toilet, that compost will become like manure,

02:44:46.160 --> 02:44:47.940
[Guest]: which you can use in the fields.

02:44:47.940 --> 02:44:53.360
[Guest]: So anyone can empty it and in fact, we went to several places, we've got our minister

02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:59.000
[Guest]: at the time, Mr. Narendra Singh Tomar, Akshay Kumar, the CAG of the time, my boss, the secretary

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:03.840
[Guest]: himself, all of them, we've got these iconic people to go into a pit, pick out that waste

02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:08.400
[Guest]: with their hands and just to showcase that it is safe and it can be handled.

02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:13.080
[Guest]: And we even did an ad about that featuring Akshay Kumar and Bhoomi Pednekar later after

02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:15.120
[Guest]: the toilet movie came out.

02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:17.600
[Guest]: So just to highlight this, that this waste is safe to handle.

02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:21.200
[Guest]: So that's the, like I said, it's an ideally constructed, correctly constructed twin-pit,

02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:25.240
[Guest]: which I agree, sometimes the pit is not correctly constructed or people will just construct

02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:30.280
[Guest]: a single pit ke, bahut ghera gadda bana do ji, bhare hi na, agli 20 saal tak na bhare.

02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:34.720
[Guest]: Wo itna ghera gadda banate hain, to then it leaches into the water table, the waste, and

02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:37.560
[Guest]: it can contaminate your water.

02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:40.600
[Guest]: So there's technical issues with it.

02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:45.960
[Guest]: But theoretically, that model exists and was the one that we at least pushed from Delhi

02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:49.480
[Guest]: and most states did adopt it, if not all.

02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:51.520
[Guest]: The second question was about caste.

02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:56.240
[Guest]: Caste is a very real problem that cannot be disentangled from sanitation.

02:45:56.240 --> 02:46:01.400
[Guest]: And it's even worse in urban areas where you see manual scavengers going inside the

02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:03.440
[Guest]: septic tanks and not coming back, right.

02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:09.600
[Guest]: There were so many deaths of sanitation workers in Delhi alone in the recent past.

02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:15.120
[Guest]: So obviously, caste is not an issue that you can ever disassociate from it.

02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:19.880
[Guest]: Having said that, there were critics that, academicians who we worked with at that time

02:46:19.880 --> 02:46:26.360
[Guest]: and we would consult them, but often found their way of doing things to be very idealistic.

02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:31.440
[Guest]: So the purest view is, first you solve caste, then you solve sanitation.

02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:36.000
[Guest]: That is the purest way of approaching it, ke pehle caste system hatao, aur ye bolo ki

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:41.080
[Guest]: koi bhi toilet saaf karega, uske baad toilets banao, so that anyone is actually, you know,

02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:46.520
[Guest]: the way Shruti has perceived the toilets to be cleaned and managed.

02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:50.880
[Amit Varma]: This was not at all her position because you have to tackle all problems simultaneously

02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:53.880
[Guest]: and obviously you're not solving caste in a hurry.

02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:57.280
[Guest]: So that's what, I mean, I haven't heard that episode, so I don't know Shruti's position,

02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:00.600
[Guest]: but she's right about caste being deeply entangled with it.

02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:04.720
[Guest]: But the purest view of caste system ko jab tak solve nahi karenge tab tak India ODF nahi

02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:08.680
[Guest]: hum sakta was like, we don't have 200 years to wait around to do that.

02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:13.840
[Guest]: So we were like, ke dekho, we have a limited frame of window, paanch me se bhi 3 saal bache

02:47:13.840 --> 02:47:16.000
[Guest]: hain, and we have to do this.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:21.600
[Guest]: At least construct the infrastructure for it and do a certain amount of behavior change

02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:25.960
[Guest]: communication to change people's behavior and encourage use of these toilets.

02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:32.600
[Guest]: And beyond that, I think problems like caste are going to get solved as we develop, as

02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:34.240
[Guest]: we get more educated as a society.

02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:38.400
[Guest]: It's going to happen in its course of time and hopefully we'll have some accelerators

02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:39.840
[Guest]: along the way.

02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:45.280
[Guest]: But it was not something that was in our area of control or could have been practically

02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:47.040
[Amit Varma]: been impacted by Swachh Bharat.

02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:49.040
[Amit Varma]: Quiz question for you.

02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:53.200
[Amit Varma]: If David Lynch was making a TV series in India today, what would he call it?

02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:54.200
[Amit Varma]: Twin Pits.

02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:55.200
[Unknown]: Oh.

02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:58.240
[Amit Varma]: He made a famous iconic series called Twin Peaks in 1990.

02:47:58.240 --> 02:47:59.240
[Amit Varma]: Sorry.

02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:00.240
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:03.240
[Guest]: That I should, you know, not do any more of these in this episode.

02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:05.480
[Guest]: So many evolved jokes are lost on me.

02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:07.480
[Guest]: Can I have a DDLJ joke?

02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:08.480
[Guest]: I'll get it.

02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:09.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm sorry.

02:48:09.480 --> 02:48:15.040
[Amit Varma]: I'll do my best to come up with a DDLJ joke by the end of this episode.

02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:17.320
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about your writing.

02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:18.320
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:24.520
[Amit Varma]: So, you've mentioned earlier that you used to write a diary daily from the 3rd standard,

02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:29.440
[Amit Varma]: you used to do journaling, you know, your first published essay was in the 4th standard

02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:33.840
[Amit Varma]: and it was about fake news or advertising and lies and so on.

02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:37.240
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, so tell me a little bit about your writing journey.

02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:38.920
[Amit Varma]: Like what drew you to writing?

02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:40.760
[Amit Varma]: Did you always want to be a writer?

02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:42.880
[Amit Varma]: What kind of writer did you want to be?

02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:47.680
[Amit Varma]: And you know, how fundamental was that a part of what you wanted out of yourself?

02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:52.280
[Amit Varma]: Like, did you always see yourself, at least in part, as a writer?

02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:58.120
[Guest]: So yeah, I told you beforehand about my earliest memories of writing and 3rd standard, my English

02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:03.080
[Guest]: teacher, she used to compulsorily write a page of a diary every day.

02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:07.560
[Guest]: And I was, as the class topper, designated the class monitor who had to check other people's

02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:08.560
[Guest]: diaries.

02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:15.640
[Guest]: I used to have like a lot of, I think that teacher gave me a lot of anxiety because I

02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:18.080
[Guest]: used to wake up in the middle of the night and check whether I had written or not.

02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:21.760
[Guest]: I was like, it was a problem, a serious problem.

02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:27.240
[Guest]: But anyway, so that was my first introduction to disciplined daily writing.

02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:31.680
[Guest]: And like you said, 4th standard, I got published and I was very proud that in the school magazine,

02:49:31.680 --> 02:49:37.000
[Guest]: there was a thing about how, it was a very cute essay, I came across it recently, that's

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:41.560
[Guest]: why I still remember it, which is about how, you know, mom says we should not tell a lie,

02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:47.000
[Guest]: but then how is Colgate also number one toothpaste and Close Up also number one toothpaste.

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:53.560
[Guest]: As a child, I'm seeing on TV, various guys are saying I'm number one, someone is lying.

02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:56.560
[Guest]: So what's going on in the world of adults?

02:49:56.560 --> 02:49:57.560
[Guest]: It was very cute.

02:49:57.560 --> 02:50:02.040
[Guest]: I mean, I mean, I used to get these small encouragements, I think, from my environment

02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:05.640
[Guest]: about, yes, she is good at English, she writes well.

02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:09.680
[Guest]: And then cut directly to college where all those magazines and all those things happened.

02:50:09.680 --> 02:50:13.640
[Guest]: I was a chief editor of an official magazine and an unofficial magazine.

02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:19.360
[Guest]: So a lot of work about collecting, not only writing yourself, but also editing other people's

02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:21.560
[Guest]: work and encouraging others to write.

02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:23.680
[Guest]: So there was a bit of element of that as well.

02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:28.560
[Guest]: And that was, in my memory, it was one of the most fun highlights of my college life.

02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:33.480
[Guest]: So there was a bit of attraction to writing at that point.

02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:38.320
[Guest]: And soon after I left, I think that was when the blogging culture had reached us, which

02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:41.520
[Guest]: is when I set up my first blog.

02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:44.520
[Guest]: And then I wrote probably 100 posts in 10 years.

02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:49.320
[Guest]: It was that intermittent, itna ruk ruk ke kabhi kabhi, kuch idea aaya toh likha aur when

02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:55.120
[Guest]: I've traveled or I've seen something, sounds like my newsletter now, you're being very

02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:56.600
[Guest]: productive other than that, right?

02:50:56.600 --> 02:50:57.920
[Guest]: Creatively, I was doing nothing else.

02:50:57.920 --> 02:51:01.040
[Guest]: I was just doing my padhai, likhai, job, bob, yahi sab.

02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:06.840
[Guest]: So there was not, I mean, I used to feel like when the inspiration strikes, I'm able to

02:51:06.840 --> 02:51:07.840
[Guest]: get up and write.

02:51:07.840 --> 02:51:10.440
[Guest]: And sometimes in the middle of the night, an idea will come and I'll get up and write

02:51:10.440 --> 02:51:13.200
[Guest]: and go back to sleep and it'll be excellent.

02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:18.000
[Guest]: At least from that lens, today, I see them in cringe, but at that time, it used to be

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:19.120
[Guest]: like aacha likha hai.

02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:24.560
[Guest]: But it was very, very few and far between, those writing forays.

02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:28.200
[Guest]: And then it was never a thing ke haan mujhe writer banna hai, like you had probably, ke

02:51:28.200 --> 02:51:30.680
[Guest]: main naukri chod ke writing karungi, aisa nahi tha kabhi.

02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:35.480
[Guest]: Very, like I said, wo middle class work aatha kehna hai, ki naukri toh chahiye, salary toh

02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:36.480
[Guest]: aani chahiye.

02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:40.560
[Guest]: But haan, yeh ek cheez hai jo mujhe, which gives me true joy.

02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:43.120
[Guest]: I mean, it's just like unadulterated joy.

02:51:43.120 --> 02:51:46.280
[Guest]: I'm getting nothing else out of this.

02:51:46.280 --> 02:51:47.280
[Guest]: But I like writing.

02:51:47.280 --> 02:51:51.920
[Guest]: I like it when other people like my writing and when people find it funny or people say

02:51:51.920 --> 02:51:57.680
[Guest]: they, it moved them or it taught them something that they, made them think in a way that they

02:51:57.680 --> 02:51:59.520
[Guest]: hadn't thought before.

02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:07.000
[Guest]: And then in parallel, I was having this whole gender evolution also, right, like coming

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:11.120
[Guest]: to those realizations that kuch toh galat hai, bohot kuch galat hai, sab kuch galat

02:52:11.120 --> 02:52:12.120
[Guest]: hai.

02:52:12.120 --> 02:52:14.480
[Guest]: So that, that was happening separately.

02:52:14.480 --> 02:52:19.120
[Guest]: But then at some point, I think the two got combined and then, then womaning is what happened

02:52:19.120 --> 02:52:20.120
[Amit Varma]: after that.

02:52:20.120 --> 02:52:24.080
[Amit Varma]: In your notes, you've mentioned that we met many years ago at Nilanjana Roy, who's been

02:52:24.080 --> 02:52:27.120
[Amit Varma]: a guest on the show, Nilanjana and her husband DD's house.

02:52:27.120 --> 02:52:28.880
[Amit Varma]: And I gave you some rude writing advice.

02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:33.960
[Amit Varma]: Now, I have no memory of this, except that I must have said something and you later remembered

02:52:33.960 --> 02:52:34.960
[Amit Varma]: it.

02:52:34.960 --> 02:52:35.960
[Amit Varma]: So maine kya bola tha?

02:52:35.960 --> 02:52:36.960
[Guest]: Kya hua tha?

02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:37.960
[Guest]: Yeh tha.

02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:40.440
[Guest]: So I was there as, I was there as Salil's plus one, right?

02:52:40.440 --> 02:52:42.320
[Guest]: Like I was just a person who didn't belong.

02:52:42.320 --> 02:52:46.920
[Guest]: So I felt like I was just, ki main kahan aagayi hoon, yeh kya baatein chal rahi hai, log French

02:52:46.920 --> 02:52:50.320
[Guest]: and Latin mein baat kar rahi hai, for all I can understand.

02:52:50.320 --> 02:52:56.080
[Guest]: Because there's like really very, I mean, refined, cultured people talking about books

02:52:56.080 --> 02:53:01.760
[Guest]: and authors that I have never heard of, very, I felt very, very pedestrian there, which

02:53:01.760 --> 02:53:03.880
[Guest]: I was obviously, still am.

02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:09.880
[Guest]: But so I think I had read your book long back, My Friend Shancho.

02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:14.840
[Guest]: And then I was like a little, kya arey, oh Amitabh is coming there and Salil was like,

02:53:14.840 --> 02:53:15.840
[Guest]: yeah, yeah, he's my friend.

02:53:15.840 --> 02:53:20.880
[Guest]: And I was most impressed that my husband is friends with such illustrious people.

02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:26.080
[Guest]: And so then he said, come, I'll introduce you and we came over to you and I, something

02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:30.480
[Guest]: we got talking about government work, which both of us were babus at the time.

02:53:30.480 --> 02:53:34.400
[Guest]: So we were talking about my work and all, and then I said that I've read your book and

02:53:34.400 --> 02:53:37.580
[Guest]: I said something, I also like to write, I want to write.

02:53:37.580 --> 02:53:40.720
[Guest]: And so you are the first, you said, so why don't you?

02:53:40.720 --> 02:53:49.000
[Guest]: I was like, so offended, how dare he, why don't you, because it was really, truly the

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:54.400
[Guest]: most pragmatic advice and that's to this day, the advice I would give to other people who

02:53:54.400 --> 02:53:59.760
[Guest]: would come to me and say that you write womaning and I also want to write, the very, the truest

02:53:59.760 --> 02:54:03.960
[Guest]: and purest advice is why don't you, because writing is just that, right, it's a verb,

02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:10.320
[Guest]: it's a course, being a writer is like not a noun, it's a verb, it's a thing of doing.

02:54:10.320 --> 02:54:14.360
[Guest]: I did this class before yours, a course in which somebody said that writer is the one

02:54:14.360 --> 02:54:18.720
[Guest]: profession to which most of the people that claim they belong to that profession don't

02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:20.600
[Guest]: actually practice it, right.

02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:24.540
[Guest]: Many people will say I'm a writer, but they don't actually do the verb of writing.

02:54:24.540 --> 02:54:29.120
[Guest]: And that's where the entire secret of good writing or any writing is that you have to

02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:32.960
[Guest]: sit, park your Tashrif in a chair and do it.

02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:35.240
[Guest]: Because I was, I mean, basically, I was not doing it.

02:54:35.240 --> 02:54:36.240
[Guest]: And you told me to do it.

02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:42.520
[Guest]: Obviously, it was not offensive as much as it was very, very pure and I felt like, yeah,

02:54:42.520 --> 02:54:43.520
[Amit Varma]: he's right.

02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:44.520
[Amit Varma]: Why, what is stopping me?

02:54:44.520 --> 02:54:48.300
[Amit Varma]: You know, now that you mention it, and I can see why I might have said that.

02:54:48.300 --> 02:54:50.360
[Amit Varma]: But it is rude.

02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:55.360
[Amit Varma]: Just looking back, because I think it's something you can say from a position of privilege where

02:54:55.360 --> 02:55:00.000
[Amit Varma]: I was a master of my own time, ki mujhe agar routine banani hai ki har rosh 3 ghante mein

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.400
[Amit Varma]: badd ke likhunga, I can make that routine.

02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:06.060
[Amit Varma]: You know, other people necessarily can't, lives are complicated.

02:55:06.060 --> 02:55:09.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, one of the struggles that writers face, especially women face when they're juggling

02:55:09.720 --> 02:55:14.560
[Amit Varma]: so much, is ki time kaha se banaye, mind space kaha se banaye, you know, you have so many

02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:17.720
[Amit Varma]: things going on that you just don't have that.

02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:21.800
[Amit Varma]: And taking that into account, this is not something I should have said.

02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:22.800
[Guest]: So you know, today.

02:55:22.800 --> 02:55:23.800
[Guest]: No, no, no.

02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:24.800
[Guest]: But it was true, right?

02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:29.080
[Guest]: See, if I'm aspiring to be a writer, then it is the purest advice there is.

02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:34.240
[Guest]: Of course, there is context and I had a whole other life, I was a very high stress job at

02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:38.480
[Guest]: the PMO at that time and all, but sach hai, sach toh sach hai.

02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:39.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:42.640
[Amit Varma]: And in case any listeners are surprised that you mentioned a book of mine and why don't

02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:43.640
[Amit Varma]: I talk about it.

02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:47.960
[Amit Varma]: I wrote this book in six weeks in 2009, and I should never have published it.

02:55:47.960 --> 02:55:49.760
[Amit Varma]: I think I embarrassed myself.

02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:53.960
[Amit Varma]: But unfortunately, I showed it to publisher friends and there was a bidding war and it

02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:55.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of it happened.

02:55:55.000 --> 02:56:00.280
[Amit Varma]: I got carried away in the moment, not close enough to sort of see the wood for the trees.

02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:04.800
[Amit Varma]: And I always keep saying that I will redeem myself one day, which I promise you I will.

02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:09.040
[Amit Varma]: But that's not really something that I'm particularly thrilled about.

02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:10.600
[Guest]: No, it was a fun book.

02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:11.600
[Guest]: I liked it a lot.

02:56:11.600 --> 02:56:16.880
[Guest]: Even now, sometimes I see a chhipkali and I think, oh, my friends are there.

02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:18.200
[Amit Varma]: There's a chhipkali in the book.

02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:21.120
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of talk about womaning then.

02:56:21.120 --> 02:56:25.160
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned that these separate things are coming together and that one is that you're

02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:26.960
[Amit Varma]: thinking of all of these issues, right?

02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:31.760
[Amit Varma]: And on the other hand, you're a writer, you write, you like writing, however, your track

02:56:31.760 --> 02:56:34.700
[Amit Varma]: record of writing is 100 posts in 10 years, right?

02:56:34.700 --> 02:56:36.520
[Amit Varma]: So how is it coming together in your mind?

02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:41.520
[Amit Varma]: Is it like one of these hawa mein thoughts ki kisi din mai likhungi or, you know, how

02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:45.680
[Amit Varma]: does when does it start to fructify and become a concrete thing?

02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:54.340
[Amit Varma]: And when does that earth get so much that, you know, the verb takes over from the possibility

02:56:54.340 --> 02:56:57.200
[Amit Varma]: of the noun in terms of writing and writer?

02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:58.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:03.120
[Guest]: So for womaning, the idea came to me at a very particular moment, which I have identified

02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:04.120
[Guest]: and remember.

02:57:04.120 --> 02:57:06.480
[Guest]: So I was Swachh Bharat mein in our office.

02:57:06.480 --> 02:57:09.800
[Guest]: We would do a lot of, like I said, travel to districts and all.

02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:14.560
[Guest]: And a couple of us had gone out to various parts of the country and we had converged

02:57:14.560 --> 02:57:17.280
[Guest]: back in Delhi to report our findings and all.

02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:22.680
[Guest]: And so we were all having lunch and informal conversation was happening, kya kya dekha,

02:57:22.680 --> 02:57:24.880
[Guest]: kaha rahe, kaisa raha, yeh wo.

02:57:24.880 --> 02:57:30.520
[Guest]: And then I had said, I think at that point, that I was put up in, it was a small town

02:57:30.520 --> 02:57:35.440
[Guest]: and I was put up in a hotel room where, you know, there is an auto lock in the door.

02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:37.480
[Guest]: So it's not a kundi.

02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:42.160
[Guest]: It's a lock that just with the, you turn a knob and that's a lock.

02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:45.200
[Guest]: Basically that means it's a lock that can also be opened from outside.

02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:49.480
[Guest]: The kundi is the only thing, the latch is the only thing that is a hardware between

02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:52.440
[Guest]: you and a person outside who has the master key.

02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:58.360
[Guest]: So I said, I was, I was a bit terrified because the hotel was not the most unshady ones out

02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:01.840
[Guest]: there and the staff was, I was a little concerned for safety.

02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:07.320
[Guest]: And so raat ko main, I, maybe I overreacted, but main raat ko table, ek furniture, der

02:58:07.320 --> 02:58:12.200
[Guest]: darwaza ki against laga ke soyi, ke agar koi room mein ghusega toh at least I'll wake up

02:58:12.200 --> 02:58:13.960
[Guest]: with the noise, like that.

02:58:13.960 --> 02:58:18.320
[Guest]: And I thought that I was like, you know, I've said before that women think that these experiences

02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:19.720
[Guest]: are unique to us.

02:58:19.720 --> 02:58:23.760
[Guest]: And I thought I was the only paranoid person out there doing such a thing.

02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:28.040
[Guest]: But then there was another woman at that lunch table and who said, arey yeh same thing happened

02:58:28.040 --> 02:58:29.040
[Guest]: with me also.

02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:30.040
[Guest]: I also do this.

02:58:30.040 --> 02:58:34.760
[Guest]: Often I go to, whenever I'm traveling to these chota, small town mein chota hotel where

02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:39.440
[Guest]: safety is not a big guarantee, I also do this, mujhe bhi kundi pasand, agar kundi na ho toh

02:58:39.440 --> 02:58:44.080
[Guest]: I am also stressed the entire night, I can't sleep and sometimes I put furniture, sometimes

02:58:44.080 --> 02:58:45.880
[Guest]: I just don't sleep and things like that.

02:58:45.880 --> 02:58:50.160
[Guest]: And then ek ek karke two three women said, oh me too, me too.

02:58:50.160 --> 02:58:53.960
[Guest]: And then there was this one guy who was there and he was like, did you guys like plan this

02:58:53.960 --> 02:58:54.960
[Guest]: beforehand?

02:58:54.960 --> 02:58:55.960
[Guest]: Is this a prank on me?

02:58:55.960 --> 02:58:57.680
[Guest]: Because what are you all even talking about?

02:58:57.680 --> 02:59:00.200
[Guest]: I can't relate at all to this.

02:59:00.200 --> 02:59:02.800
[Guest]: If never, this thought has never crossed my mind.

02:59:02.800 --> 02:59:07.520
[Guest]: For me, somehow that moment was a, I mean, obviously there's history behind it.

02:59:07.520 --> 02:59:11.160
[Guest]: But that is when the coin dropped in my mind.

02:59:11.160 --> 02:59:12.800
[Guest]: Is the expression coin dropped or what?

02:59:12.800 --> 02:59:13.800
[Guest]: Pin dropped?

02:59:13.800 --> 02:59:14.800
[Amit Varma]: Something dropped in my mind.

02:59:14.800 --> 02:59:15.800
[Amit Varma]: Listen, we get it.

02:59:15.800 --> 02:59:16.800
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't matter.

02:59:16.800 --> 02:59:17.800
[Amit Varma]: So, kuch chamka mereko.

02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:18.800
[Amit Varma]: Light bulb chamka.

02:59:18.800 --> 02:59:19.800
[Amit Varma]: Basically, haan, kuch chamka.

02:59:19.800 --> 02:59:28.200
[Guest]: So, chamka yeh ki there is this whole life that women are living and we are living so

02:59:28.200 --> 02:59:29.200
[Guest]: close to each other.

02:59:29.200 --> 02:59:34.760
[Guest]: We are sometimes husband and wife cohabiting and father, daughter, brother, sister living

02:59:34.760 --> 02:59:39.520
[Guest]: together in the same house, having such starkly different life experiences or colleagues working

02:59:39.520 --> 02:59:41.000
[Guest]: in the same office.

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:44.640
[Guest]: Having itna different experiences that women are seeing a whole different side of the world

02:59:44.640 --> 02:59:46.600
[Guest]: that men are just not seeing.

02:59:46.600 --> 02:59:51.840
[Guest]: And even the most well-intentioned men out there who are like, oh women, full support,

02:59:51.840 --> 02:59:55.440
[Guest]: feminist, even those men are often just unaware of it.

02:59:55.440 --> 02:59:56.800
[Guest]: It's by no fault of their own.

02:59:56.800 --> 02:59:58.600
[Guest]: They've not had that experience and they're unaware.

02:59:58.600 --> 03:00:03.040
[Guest]: So, for me, that was a bulb moment that I felt ki ispe likhna chahiye.

03:00:03.040 --> 03:00:09.160
[Guest]: I should just talk to women and get these stories about things that women experience

03:00:09.160 --> 03:00:13.760
[Guest]: and it's very common between us and which men probably haven't thought of.

03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:17.960
[Guest]: And so, for me, because I had thought about feminism and I mean, I don't like to use that

03:00:17.960 --> 03:00:21.400
[Guest]: word because that word now means different things to different people and many people

03:00:21.400 --> 03:00:26.240
[Guest]: are all actually aligned to the thought of it, but just don't like the word because they

03:00:26.240 --> 03:00:27.680
[Guest]: interpret it differently.

03:00:27.680 --> 03:00:31.920
[Guest]: But either way, I had thought about writing about gender a lot and I used to think, you

03:00:31.920 --> 03:00:36.400
[Guest]: know, people write either about data, which is not my forte, I'm not a data scientist

03:00:36.400 --> 03:00:39.840
[Guest]: and I'm not the most knowledgeable person on that front.

03:00:39.840 --> 03:00:44.360
[Guest]: Some people write opinion pieces, but opinion mein yahi ho jata hai ki yeh toh is ladki ko

03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:45.360
[Guest]: opinion hai.

03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:46.360
[Guest]: I disagree.

03:00:46.360 --> 03:00:47.360
[Guest]: Baat wahi khatam.

03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:51.680
[Guest]: So, that's why for me, it was that ek toh meri apni writing mein, I feel like I'm more

03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:58.800
[Guest]: of a storyteller than a very concrete opinion writer and otherwise also, I find that stories

03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:00.200
[Guest]: are much more powerful.

03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:05.200
[Guest]: So, there was this documentary, it's on Netflix, Inside Bill's Brain, about Bill Gates.

03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:08.920
[Guest]: Usmein, there's one of the, there are these four episodes, I think, usmein se ek episode

03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:15.640
[Guest]: mein Bill Gates and Melinda, now Melinda French Gates, they're together talking about an issue.

03:01:15.640 --> 03:01:18.520
[Guest]: I think it was malaria in African kids.

03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:22.440
[Guest]: I'd forget the exact issue, but basically what they were saying was that Bill Gates

03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:27.640
[Guest]: would see data, k so many thousands of children losing their lives to malaria or diarrhea

03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:30.880
[Guest]: or whatever it was, and he would get moved by the data.

03:01:30.880 --> 03:01:36.840
[Guest]: But Melinda would say, said that for me, the numbers weren't so real until I traveled to

03:01:36.840 --> 03:01:40.840
[Guest]: Africa and I've met one mother who had lost one child.

03:01:40.840 --> 03:01:44.960
[Guest]: And for me, that moved me so much that it ultimately led to the setup of the Bill and

03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:46.480
[Guest]: Melinda Gates Foundation.

03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:52.480
[Guest]: So, for me, that was another Chamko bulb, light bulb moment because I felt like stories

03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:57.040
[Guest]: have so much more power than data, even though objectively thousands of children dying is

03:01:57.040 --> 03:01:58.800
[Guest]: worse than one child.

03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:04.760
[Guest]: But for a human being, for most of us, stories are what move us much more than data does.

03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:09.600
[Guest]: And so that was the, I decided at that point, it suddenly became quite clear to me the kind

03:02:09.600 --> 03:02:13.400
[Guest]: of writing I'll do, the way I will build these stories and these arguments, how I'll pick

03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:19.360
[Guest]: a theme about a subject that's not obvious to men, but is a lived experience of a majority

03:02:19.360 --> 03:02:20.520
[Guest]: of women.

03:02:20.520 --> 03:02:24.400
[Guest]: And then I'll interview women and real women's real stories I'll write.

03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:26.280
[Guest]: And that's how I will build that argument.

03:02:26.280 --> 03:02:27.800
[Guest]: It was not my personal opinion.

03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:32.000
[Guest]: This is the lived experience of these many women, which by the way, if now you talk to

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.600
[Guest]: the woman sitting next to you, maybe she'll also concur.

03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:39.720
[Guest]: So that I felt might move the needle, at least when it came to individual opinions.

03:02:39.720 --> 03:02:44.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and the importance of storytelling is, you know, really, it's a difference that I

03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:49.760
[Amit Varma]: keep talking about, you know, even in my writing class, or even generally, it's a difference

03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:51.600
[Amit Varma]: between the abstract and the concrete.

03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:57.360
[Amit Varma]: So you know, in Bill Gates's case, or in anybody's case, large numbers are abstract, you know,

03:02:57.360 --> 03:03:01.800
[Amit Varma]: whereas actually a particular story of a particular person is concrete.

03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:06.440
[Amit Varma]: And that has a far greater impact, your mirror neurons line up, as it were, in your head

03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:13.400
[Amit Varma]: and much better chance of sort of empathy and kind of relating.

03:03:13.400 --> 03:03:15.520
[Amit Varma]: And you know, what do you speak about the kundi?

03:03:15.520 --> 03:03:19.280
[Amit Varma]: And you know, kundi not being there, I remember the first person who mentioned this to me

03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:24.080
[Amit Varma]: was I'd done an episode on Me Too around the time Me Too happened with Supriya Nair and

03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:25.080
[Amit Varma]: Nikita Saxena.

03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:28.760
[Amit Varma]: And Nikita, of course, was a caravan journalist who would go around the country everywhere.

03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:33.920
[Amit Varma]: And she pointed this out that men just completely sort of take it for granted.

03:03:33.920 --> 03:03:36.040
[Amit Varma]: It's not something they would even look for.

03:03:36.040 --> 03:03:39.360
[Amit Varma]: But for every woman, it's a real thing.

03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:44.120
[Amit Varma]: It's part of that layer, that added layer of concern that women carry around with them,

03:03:44.120 --> 03:03:49.240
[Amit Varma]: which men simply don't see, like I can go for a walk at midnight, or I can enter a crowded

03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:53.480
[Amit Varma]: lift without having to look around or I can, you know, check into a hotel without caring

03:03:53.480 --> 03:03:55.640
[Amit Varma]: about whether the kundi is there.

03:03:55.640 --> 03:03:57.960
[Amit Varma]: But women carried these layers.

03:03:57.960 --> 03:04:00.920
[Amit Varma]: In fact, when I was going through your posts, I was kind of putting them in different kinds

03:04:00.920 --> 03:04:01.920
[Amit Varma]: of categories.

03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:05.800
[Amit Varma]: And one of those categories was what only women go through, you know, and these are

03:04:05.800 --> 03:04:08.160
[Amit Varma]: all things that are part of this layer, you know.

03:04:08.160 --> 03:04:13.080
[Amit Varma]: So in a post where you actually wrote about this kundi incident, you also quoted someone

03:04:13.080 --> 03:04:18.840
[Amit Varma]: called Natasha, who wrote, quote, every time I enter any public space, I look at the escape

03:04:18.840 --> 03:04:19.840
[Amit Varma]: routes.

03:04:19.840 --> 03:04:23.520
[Amit Varma]: I first look at what in the environment I can use as a weapon in case I'm attacked.

03:04:23.520 --> 03:04:25.160
[Amit Varma]: I'm mentally prepared all the time.

03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:28.520
[Amit Varma]: I have told this to male friends, and men just don't understand it.

03:04:28.520 --> 03:04:32.600
[Amit Varma]: But in our heads, we women are constantly plotting how we can use a metal water bottle

03:04:32.600 --> 03:04:36.680
[Amit Varma]: we are carrying for self-defense, like Shruti did reference to someone else, we are mentally

03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:39.880
[Amit Varma]: practicing how to use it in case we get attacked.

03:04:39.880 --> 03:04:40.880
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:44.160
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, I think if you're a man and listening to this, and you think, oh,

03:04:44.160 --> 03:04:46.880
[Amit Varma]: these are just some women to whom bad things have happened.

03:04:46.880 --> 03:04:47.880
[Amit Varma]: They're really not.

03:04:47.880 --> 03:04:53.360
[Amit Varma]: It's every woman, you know, that you have to learn to think about things in a way that

03:04:53.360 --> 03:04:54.840
[Amit Varma]: men simply don't.

03:04:54.840 --> 03:04:59.960
[Amit Varma]: And this percolates along other fault lines, you know, it's there in caste as well.

03:04:59.960 --> 03:05:04.060
[Amit Varma]: You know, if somebody asked me what my surname is, after I say, Hi, I'm Amit, I don't even

03:05:04.060 --> 03:05:05.480
[Amit Varma]: think twice about it.

03:05:05.480 --> 03:05:10.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, for someone who is, you know, not of the same caste, there is that added layer

03:05:10.840 --> 03:05:15.500
[Amit Varma]: of hostility and weariness that kind of that you sense from the other person.

03:05:15.500 --> 03:05:20.640
[Amit Varma]: So it's interesting just to, you know, think of the kind of life we live in India, think

03:05:20.640 --> 03:05:25.880
[Amit Varma]: of all the different fault lines, and all the different layers that are therefore invisible

03:05:25.880 --> 03:05:26.880
[Amit Varma]: to us.

03:05:26.880 --> 03:05:30.360
[Amit Varma]: And then get back to your narrative, you know, you've thought that you want to tell the stories

03:05:30.360 --> 03:05:34.800
[Amit Varma]: of women to kind of make all of these connections, but you're thinking of it at that point as

03:05:34.800 --> 03:05:35.800
[Guest]: a book.

03:05:35.800 --> 03:05:42.960
[Guest]: So this idea was probably I carried around for two years, or maybe three years, because

03:05:42.960 --> 03:05:48.640
[Guest]: soon after this idea came to me, I was pregnant with this idea and then pregnant with an actual

03:05:48.640 --> 03:05:49.640
[Guest]: child.

03:05:49.640 --> 03:05:50.960
[Guest]: So that that kind of took over.

03:05:50.960 --> 03:05:56.200
[Guest]: And then we had our baby and then COVID happened around the same time.

03:05:56.200 --> 03:06:00.560
[Guest]: And then some, I mean, this idea was constantly with me, I would often go back and think about

03:06:00.560 --> 03:06:01.560
[Guest]: it.

03:06:01.560 --> 03:06:03.400
[Guest]: But I was thinking about it like a book.

03:06:03.400 --> 03:06:08.400
[Guest]: And as I mean, I'm no imposter syndrome here, genuinely, I'm a very undisciplined person,

03:06:08.400 --> 03:06:12.840
[Guest]: because I need a deadline or something to work towards, otherwise, I don't, I don't

03:06:12.840 --> 03:06:18.480
[Guest]: of my own volition will not sit down to do something without an answerability or a deadline

03:06:18.480 --> 03:06:21.980
[Guest]: just programmed that way by our education system.

03:06:21.980 --> 03:06:25.080
[Guest]: So for that reason, I think I never wrote a word about it.

03:06:25.080 --> 03:06:29.160
[Guest]: I mean, I would talk to women and I would note down their stories on my phone in an

03:06:29.160 --> 03:06:35.600
[Guest]: app evernote, I would write them sometimes on on the laptop and paste them there.

03:06:35.600 --> 03:06:40.720
[Guest]: And then, but I had these disparate collection of stories over several months and years of

03:06:40.720 --> 03:06:47.400
[Guest]: talking to women, but I hadn't actually sat sit down to, you know, start writing the book.

03:06:47.400 --> 03:06:53.480
[Guest]: And then around somewhere, I think in September cohort, I was in in your course.

03:06:53.480 --> 03:06:57.680
[Guest]: And so the the course was great, of course, but at the end of the course, I think the

03:06:57.680 --> 03:07:05.680
[Guest]: conversation that I you and I had was for me the big, well, decisive moment.

03:07:05.680 --> 03:07:09.320
[Guest]: After the course ended, I told you that, you know, I have this book idea and can we discuss

03:07:09.320 --> 03:07:13.120
[Guest]: it and then we had a zoom call and I told you the idea.

03:07:13.120 --> 03:07:17.400
[Guest]: And I also had a lot of concerns, I remember at that time about writing it as a privileged

03:07:17.400 --> 03:07:22.960
[Guest]: woman, because, you know, what if people say that you're, if I don't write about women

03:07:22.960 --> 03:07:28.200
[Guest]: who are suffering from many other and much more devastating challenges like poverty and

03:07:28.200 --> 03:07:33.320
[Guest]: caste and all of that, if I don't write about them, then this is a first world woman problem.

03:07:33.320 --> 03:07:36.960
[Guest]: If I write about them, then people say you're appropriating, you don't know what you're

03:07:36.960 --> 03:07:39.040
[Guest]: writing about, which I truly don't.

03:07:39.040 --> 03:07:42.080
[Guest]: I've had all of these concerns and questions in my mind.

03:07:42.080 --> 03:07:45.520
[Guest]: And I remember that conversation with you was very clarifying for me, because you said,

03:07:45.520 --> 03:07:50.040
[Guest]: you know, you write what you think about what you know about and what you feel happy, confident

03:07:50.040 --> 03:07:53.480
[Guest]: writing and don't worry about all of this criticism.

03:07:53.480 --> 03:07:56.240
[Guest]: I'd imagined too many layers of criticism in my mind.

03:07:56.240 --> 03:08:00.800
[Guest]: So for me, it was quite freeing to let go of that, kya hoga toh hoga, dekhenge, but

03:08:00.800 --> 03:08:05.400
[Guest]: for now, let me just write what I feel strongly about, like these things are my lived experiences.

03:08:05.400 --> 03:08:08.200
[Guest]: So at least that I can, that's where I can start.

03:08:08.200 --> 03:08:12.460
[Guest]: And it's not like there's a hierarchy of problems, right?

03:08:12.460 --> 03:08:16.040
[Guest]: Because you have a problem, which is a quote unquote first world problem, so it's not a

03:08:16.040 --> 03:08:17.040
[Guest]: problem anymore.

03:08:17.040 --> 03:08:20.920
[Guest]: Like if you are not able to sleep through the night, because you're worried about your

03:08:20.920 --> 03:08:26.520
[Guest]: safety in a place where you've paid good money to stay be and be safe, then that's a legitimate

03:08:26.520 --> 03:08:27.800
[Guest]: real problem.

03:08:27.800 --> 03:08:33.680
[Guest]: Even if you're not starving, and even if you're, you don't have any of the other multiple multitudes

03:08:33.680 --> 03:08:38.300
[Guest]: of problem that women, other women suffer from, it doesn't diminish that you are still

03:08:38.300 --> 03:08:42.480
[Guest]: facing a challenge that's unfair, and it's totally because of your gender.

03:08:42.480 --> 03:08:43.480
[Guest]: So that was freeing.

03:08:43.480 --> 03:08:46.960
[Guest]: And then you also, the biggest thing was that you said write it as a newsletter, which I

03:08:46.960 --> 03:08:49.240
[Guest]: had never considered up till that point.

03:08:49.240 --> 03:08:53.120
[Guest]: And then you said that, you know, because you're not, also not the challenge, I'd challenge

03:08:53.120 --> 03:08:57.320
[Guest]: of not having the self-discipline to write a chapter a day or a chapter a week, just

03:08:57.320 --> 03:09:02.840
[Guest]: put yourself, give yourself a weekly deadline, ke har hafte ek post nikalna hai.

03:09:02.840 --> 03:09:06.200
[Guest]: And then I was like, ki yaar weekly karein, ki fortnightly karein, ho payega, ki nahin

03:09:06.200 --> 03:09:07.200
[Guest]: ho payega.

03:09:07.200 --> 03:09:10.200
[Guest]: And then, but then you said that, you know, you will, before you realize it, you'll have

03:09:10.200 --> 03:09:11.760
[Guest]: a body of work behind you.

03:09:11.760 --> 03:09:15.960
[Guest]: And then somebody who discovers you two years down the line can actually go back and click

03:09:15.960 --> 03:09:19.240
[Guest]: into the stuff you've written along the way.

03:09:19.240 --> 03:09:23.600
[Guest]: And that in itself is a, is an achievement to have that body of work.

03:09:23.600 --> 03:09:25.720
[Guest]: And then later, if you want to make it a book.

03:09:25.720 --> 03:09:30.360
[Guest]: So for me, that was a tipping point where I said, and I think even after, uske bhi do

03:09:30.360 --> 03:09:36.680
[Guest]: teen mahine baad jaake, like today, if anyone goes and sees my first welcome post, it begins,

03:09:36.680 --> 03:09:39.320
[Guest]: the publishing date is October 3rd or something.

03:09:39.320 --> 03:09:40.600
[Guest]: But it came out in December.

03:09:40.600 --> 03:09:41.600
[Guest]: It came out in December.

03:09:41.600 --> 03:09:45.160
[Guest]: So the first thing I written is that there is a two month gap in the date on this piece

03:09:45.160 --> 03:09:50.440
[Guest]: and the actual publishing of this piece, because I put it out and then I didn't put it out

03:09:50.440 --> 03:09:51.440
[Guest]: there.

03:09:51.440 --> 03:09:53.480
[Guest]: I mean, I published it very locally as a private thing.

03:09:53.480 --> 03:09:55.640
[Guest]: That's why the publishing date is two months behind.

03:09:55.640 --> 03:10:00.360
[Guest]: So it took me two months to kind of, you know, gather the courage to do it and feel like

03:10:00.360 --> 03:10:02.880
[Guest]: kya theek hai, there's something I could pull off.

03:10:02.880 --> 03:10:10.200
[Guest]: And so on my birthday, 4th December in 2020, was when I kind of went public with it, ki

03:10:10.200 --> 03:10:12.920
[Guest]: theek hai, ab main likh rahi hoon, dekha jayega.

03:10:12.920 --> 03:10:17.440
[Guest]: And then I got like 100 subscribers on day one, and I was very shocked ki yaar, damn

03:10:17.440 --> 03:10:22.360
[Guest]: people have actual faith in me now, I had better turn up the next Friday.

03:10:22.360 --> 03:10:26.040
[Guest]: At that time, I used to publish on Fridays, now I publish Mondays.

03:10:26.040 --> 03:10:27.800
[Guest]: But so that's where it started.

03:10:27.800 --> 03:10:31.960
[Guest]: And now I have a weekly deadline to work towards, so there's really no getting around it.

03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:36.520
[Guest]: I do have to write, which is thanks to you, I have actually built up a significant body

03:10:36.520 --> 03:10:37.520
[Amit Varma]: of work.

03:10:37.520 --> 03:10:41.560
[Amit Varma]: No, it's a it's an impressive body of work and really impresses me is that even though

03:10:41.560 --> 03:10:46.480
[Amit Varma]: you took that couple of months to get down to it, once you got down to it, you were so

03:10:46.480 --> 03:10:50.800
[Amit Varma]: regular, you know, clockwork pe aata tha, ki iska toh aana hi hai, whatever day you

03:10:50.800 --> 03:10:55.720
[Amit Varma]: decided you changed that later, but iska toh aana hi hai, which was impressive to me, because

03:10:55.720 --> 03:11:00.640
[Amit Varma]: it wasn't just someone sitting down and writing their own thoughts, a lot of work went into

03:11:00.640 --> 03:11:04.240
[Amit Varma]: it in terms of research in terms of speaking to people and all of that.

03:11:04.240 --> 03:11:08.600
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about your work ethic during this period and how you manage this.

03:11:08.600 --> 03:11:13.400
[Amit Varma]: Like this is author called Mason Curry, who'd once come out with a book called Daily Rituals,

03:11:13.400 --> 03:11:18.120
[Amit Varma]: where he spoke to writers about their work habits and their work ethics and all that.

03:11:18.120 --> 03:11:22.120
[Amit Varma]: And he was criticized correctly that boss, it's all men, you know, men ke liye toh alag

03:11:22.120 --> 03:11:27.240
[Amit Varma]: hai, men toh apna sab kar sakte hai and you know, there'll be clockwork creatures in the

03:11:27.240 --> 03:11:30.720
[Amit Varma]: background providing them the food and providing them everything and kind of taking care of

03:11:30.720 --> 03:11:31.720
[Amit Varma]: all that.

03:11:31.720 --> 03:11:32.720
[Amit Varma]: What about women?

03:11:32.720 --> 03:11:36.600
[Amit Varma]: And then Curry to his credit came out with a book called I think Women Artists at Work

03:11:36.600 --> 03:11:39.080
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, I'll kind of put that up.

03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:45.680
[Amit Varma]: So I'm curious about how you then manage to get all the writing done, given that at the

03:11:45.680 --> 03:11:50.760
[Amit Varma]: same time, there is baby, there is house, there is family, there is, you know, everything

03:11:50.760 --> 03:11:52.680
[Amit Varma]: else is kind of also happening.

03:11:52.680 --> 03:11:57.000
[Amit Varma]: How do you then find that mind space, find the discipline?

03:11:57.000 --> 03:12:01.520
[Amit Varma]: So what were the methods that you kind of what were those early weeks like when you

03:12:01.520 --> 03:12:06.200
[Amit Varma]: were kind of finding a groove just where you can write and you can bring it out on time?

03:12:06.200 --> 03:12:07.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:12:07.200 --> 03:12:13.240
[Guest]: So like I said, I had these disparate stories collected in on a note taking app, which which

03:12:13.240 --> 03:12:19.080
[Guest]: were the first body that I tapped into, okay, let's look at three or four and figure out

03:12:19.080 --> 03:12:21.840
[Guest]: what is the most compelling one to me right now.

03:12:21.840 --> 03:12:27.120
[Guest]: And my first post was about maternity discrimination, because I was literally a new mother at that

03:12:27.120 --> 03:12:28.120
[Guest]: point.

03:12:28.120 --> 03:12:32.720
[Guest]: And I had just been talking to you, you know, when you become a mother, somebody, some kind

03:12:32.720 --> 03:12:37.200
[Guest]: of woman will add you to a mom's group, and that's where you will discuss all your problems,

03:12:37.200 --> 03:12:43.000
[Guest]: like breastfeeding, the kid has a rash, what to do, he has a fever, what to do, the kid

03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:48.280
[Guest]: is eating, not eating, sleeping, not sleeping, all your early new mother concerns, which

03:12:48.280 --> 03:12:54.040
[Guest]: there's always something going terribly wrong in your life that is making you question your

03:12:54.040 --> 03:12:55.560
[Guest]: worth as a human being.

03:12:55.560 --> 03:13:00.840
[Guest]: So that tapping into that group and community at that time can be a huge source of comfort

03:13:00.840 --> 03:13:01.840
[Guest]: and support.

03:13:01.840 --> 03:13:06.000
[Guest]: I don't know how moms did it before this technology was available.

03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:11.920
[Guest]: So that became my starting point, because we would talk there also about joining back

03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:16.520
[Guest]: work and how many moms would feel that, you know, I'm not getting the same position, the

03:13:16.520 --> 03:13:21.400
[Guest]: same kind of projects are not coming my way, or my organization has said, some people will

03:13:21.400 --> 03:13:26.640
[Guest]: let go also some women after becoming a mother that you can't keep up with those deadlines

03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:27.640
[Guest]: and all that.

03:13:27.640 --> 03:13:30.640
[Guest]: Like people would decide on your behalf, even if you are ready to put in the work to meet

03:13:30.640 --> 03:13:35.520
[Guest]: the deadlines and do the stressful work, which should not be imposed on people, but even

03:13:35.520 --> 03:13:39.800
[Guest]: if you volunteer to do it, people will decide on your behalf that you no longer can.

03:13:39.800 --> 03:13:40.800
[Guest]: So bye.

03:13:40.800 --> 03:13:45.080
[Guest]: So in India, there is no law against maternity discrimination, that was the first piece I

03:13:45.080 --> 03:13:48.000
[Guest]: wrote and that had only stories of two women.

03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:53.160
[Guest]: And I kind of tried the way of, if you read that postage, first her story, then another's,

03:13:53.160 --> 03:13:57.920
[Guest]: then another's, then another's, then another's, so they go in parallel and then later I talk

03:13:57.920 --> 03:14:02.480
[Guest]: about how their experiences were different yet similar and blah, blah, blah, the laws

03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:04.680
[Guest]: in US law in India.

03:14:04.680 --> 03:14:10.440
[Guest]: Then the second one was, I think about body shaming, which another issue very close to

03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:12.400
[Guest]: heart very personally felt.

03:14:12.400 --> 03:14:18.360
[Guest]: And then the moment I, that one I didn't have many backup of many stories, but I just asked

03:14:18.360 --> 03:14:22.840
[Guest]: a couple of friends and you talk to the first five women, you'll have five stories about

03:14:22.840 --> 03:14:23.840
[Guest]: body shaming.

03:14:23.840 --> 03:14:25.840
[Guest]: It's that universal among women.

03:14:25.840 --> 03:14:31.560
[Guest]: So it was, so Shuruma, it was my group of friends and my direct circle.

03:14:31.560 --> 03:14:37.600
[Guest]: But soon as womaning grew and as it became a little more popular among people, more subscribers,

03:14:37.600 --> 03:14:42.040
[Guest]: more readers, more on these moms groups, women are talking about it.

03:14:42.040 --> 03:14:46.760
[Guest]: Then I started getting also stories from women I didn't originally know.

03:14:46.760 --> 03:14:51.280
[Guest]: My process was, and this is the book that you've mentioned, I've read the book, the

03:14:51.280 --> 03:14:58.280
[Guest]: man's habit, the male artist's habit is, we'll wake up in the morning, then a breakfast,

03:14:58.280 --> 03:15:04.880
[Guest]: then a coffee, then a stroll by the lake, then in the evening we'll write for two hours,

03:15:04.880 --> 03:15:10.760
[Guest]: then after that drinks at the local pub, then this, then that, I mean, then walk, hiking

03:15:10.760 --> 03:15:13.360
[Guest]: on the mountain and inspiration from all this.

03:15:13.360 --> 03:15:19.600
[Guest]: And later you Google them, they have 14 kids, who's raising those 14 kids, right?

03:15:19.600 --> 03:15:24.240
[Guest]: So no one is talking about that in the successful habits of these successful men.

03:15:24.240 --> 03:15:28.920
[Guest]: So there are, and then when you actually read up, there are, some of these men were beasts,

03:15:28.920 --> 03:15:30.200
[Guest]: they were monsters.

03:15:30.200 --> 03:15:35.200
[Guest]: The kind of things they did to their wives, to their partners, the kind of privileges

03:15:35.200 --> 03:15:39.880
[Guest]: they had, like, they want this type of food at this time and food is being presented in

03:15:39.880 --> 03:15:40.880
[Guest]: front of them.

03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:47.520
[Guest]: And she's raising kids, she's managing the household and you'll say no, no support

03:15:47.520 --> 03:15:51.920
[Guest]: stuff because kids should get the love of their mother, all beastly things these men

03:15:51.920 --> 03:15:52.920
[Guest]: have done.

03:15:52.920 --> 03:15:55.680
[Guest]: And we celebrate so many of them today.

03:15:55.680 --> 03:16:00.000
[Guest]: And you go back and you read about them.

03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:05.520
[Guest]: So this was Leo Tolstoy, who I started, who I discovered accidentally on the internet

03:16:05.520 --> 03:16:08.080
[Guest]: while I was writing a piece on breastfeeding.

03:16:08.080 --> 03:16:13.480
[Guest]: And a book had come out recently about his, someone had found an account of his wife,

03:16:13.480 --> 03:16:17.640
[Guest]: Sophia Tolstoy, and her diary or something had been made public.

03:16:17.640 --> 03:16:24.120
[Guest]: And in that, I read about how he had these 13-14 kids, and he used to force her to breastfeed

03:16:24.120 --> 03:16:25.120
[Guest]: all the children.

03:16:25.120 --> 03:16:29.240
[Guest]: And at one time, she was suffering from some postpartum issue because of which she was

03:16:29.240 --> 03:16:30.480
[Guest]: not able to.

03:16:30.480 --> 03:16:37.000
[Guest]: And then they'll breastfeed each other's children also because they're all at the

03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:38.000
[Guest]: same age.

03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:39.600
[Guest]: And it was an accepted done thing.

03:16:39.600 --> 03:16:45.200
[Guest]: So I think at that time, there was a driver's wife or some domestic help they had who also

03:16:45.200 --> 03:16:46.760
[Guest]: had a baby the same age.

03:16:46.760 --> 03:16:53.480
[Guest]: And so, Sophia Tolstoy wanted to ask that, request that woman to breastfeed the baby.

03:16:53.480 --> 03:16:57.240
[Guest]: And Leo Tolstoy said, no, you will not do it and you have to do it yourself.

03:16:57.240 --> 03:17:03.120
[Guest]: And then ultimately, I think that lady ended up feeding their child and he wrote a very

03:17:03.120 --> 03:17:11.080
[Guest]: cruel play about his wife mocking her and called his son as the outcast or orphan or

03:17:11.080 --> 03:17:14.920
[Guest]: something was raised by somebody else like there was a lot of toxicity there.

03:17:14.920 --> 03:17:18.600
[Amit Varma]: I just want to make one point about Tolstoy that he was one of the great virtue signallers

03:17:18.600 --> 03:17:19.600
[Amit Varma]: of his time.

03:17:19.600 --> 03:17:23.040
[Amit Varma]: He used to talk a lot of spiritual stuff, he used to share knowledge, Gandhi also was

03:17:23.040 --> 03:17:24.160
[Amit Varma]: impressed by him.

03:17:24.160 --> 03:17:30.280
[Amit Varma]: And one thing that I consistently say today, in light of all the woke virtue signalling

03:17:30.280 --> 03:17:35.400
[Amit Varma]: that goes on on Twitter also is that those who signal the most virtue possess the least.

03:17:35.400 --> 03:17:37.680
[Amit Varma]: And I think Tolstoy is a classic example of that.

03:17:37.680 --> 03:17:39.480
[Amit Varma]: But sorry, my pet rant out of the way.

03:17:39.480 --> 03:17:44.480
[Guest]: Yeah, no, even Einstein, I recently read about him and I had written about him in that imposter

03:17:44.480 --> 03:17:45.480
[Guest]: journal.

03:17:45.480 --> 03:17:48.480
[Guest]: I'm going to go back and delete that man's name because now I'm upset.

03:17:48.480 --> 03:17:55.080
[Guest]: His wife had helped him a lot in his research, apparently, in all of this relativity shit

03:17:55.080 --> 03:17:58.120
[Guest]: that we consider him a god for.

03:17:58.120 --> 03:18:02.080
[Guest]: He basically did not quote her, give her credit in the paper they wrote together, to which

03:18:02.080 --> 03:18:04.680
[Guest]: research she had contributed a lot.

03:18:04.680 --> 03:18:09.840
[Guest]: And there was, I read an article which was comparing him and Pierre Curie, who, Madame

03:18:09.840 --> 03:18:13.040
[Guest]: Curie and her husband, they did this research together.

03:18:13.040 --> 03:18:18.280
[Guest]: And then when he was nominated for a Nobel, he said that my wife will also get it.

03:18:18.280 --> 03:18:20.780
[Guest]: She's been an equal partner in this research.

03:18:20.780 --> 03:18:22.800
[Guest]: And that's why we know Marie Curie's name, right?

03:18:22.800 --> 03:18:27.080
[Guest]: And then growing up for me as a child, that was the single one female scientist I could

03:18:27.080 --> 03:18:28.240
[Guest]: have named.

03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:30.760
[Guest]: And to this day, I don't know many people can name a second one.

03:18:30.760 --> 03:18:35.000
[Amit Varma]: By the way, on Twitter, I saw this delightful tweet, which also is a great example of mansplaining

03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:39.320
[Amit Varma]: which you've written about where this woman tweeted about how she once said that she was

03:18:39.320 --> 03:18:44.000
[Amit Varma]: a great granddaughter of Marie Curie and the man with her said, no, no, you're pronouncing

03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:45.000
[Amit Varma]: it wrong.

03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:46.000
[Amit Varma]: It's Mariah Carey.

03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:47.000
[Guest]: It's very difficult.

03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:48.000
[Guest]: We digressed a lot.

03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:49.000
[Guest]: I'm sorry.

03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:50.000
[Guest]: We were talking about developing habits.

03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:59.600
[Amit Varma]: You were talking about male writer's habits and therefore your own, right?

03:18:59.600 --> 03:19:04.320
[Guest]: So now coming to my own, there was, it was, yeah, I had a small new baby, there was a

03:19:04.320 --> 03:19:09.840
[Guest]: pandemic and my husband was being forced by the government to go to office, thus exposing

03:19:09.840 --> 03:19:12.560
[Guest]: us and giving me nightmares and a lot of stress.

03:19:12.560 --> 03:19:16.160
[Guest]: So in between all that, it was, and I had a job.

03:19:16.160 --> 03:19:18.200
[Guest]: I used to work with the World Bank at the time.

03:19:18.200 --> 03:19:21.720
[Guest]: Luckily, my boss was in the US, so I used to work at night.

03:19:21.720 --> 03:19:27.040
[Guest]: So I had actually engineered it that way, at least for the day, I'm free for caregiving

03:19:27.040 --> 03:19:33.200
[Guest]: and at night I'll do a few hours of the work and then after that, I'll do these quick calls

03:19:33.200 --> 03:19:36.360
[Guest]: and by the way, many women I'm interviewing are also mothers.

03:19:36.360 --> 03:19:38.000
[Guest]: So they are just as busy as I am.

03:19:38.000 --> 03:19:40.760
[Guest]: So it was always a huge scheduling challenge.

03:19:40.760 --> 03:19:48.200
[Guest]: So actually, not a very small percentage, but a limited percentage of the stories I've

03:19:48.200 --> 03:19:53.040
[Guest]: written about have actually been phone conversations that I've even had with them and milna to

03:19:53.040 --> 03:19:57.160
[Guest]: kher possible hi nahi tha during the pandemic, but even conversations have been very few.

03:19:57.160 --> 03:20:01.520
[Guest]: Most of them have been either chats or I've asked them to send me voice notes with, I

03:20:01.520 --> 03:20:05.080
[Guest]: send them questions and later they send voice notes as answers because I can't even expect

03:20:05.080 --> 03:20:07.940
[Guest]: a mother to type out an answer and send me.

03:20:07.940 --> 03:20:14.280
[Guest]: So women are busy on both sides of that relationship, the person who's interviewing and the interviewer.

03:20:14.280 --> 03:20:17.480
[Guest]: So that was how I would pull together these stories.

03:20:17.480 --> 03:20:22.960
[Guest]: I would decide on a theme for the week and publicly put out a call for stories that were

03:20:22.960 --> 03:20:23.960
[Guest]: harder to find.

03:20:23.960 --> 03:20:26.800
[Guest]: Like when I wrote about domestic violence and all, there's not a lot of women who will

03:20:26.800 --> 03:20:30.340
[Guest]: come out on a WhatsApp group with 200 other women and say, hi, I was abused.

03:20:30.340 --> 03:20:34.920
[Guest]: So there I would put out a call on Twitter or something so that people can privately

03:20:34.920 --> 03:20:36.260
[Guest]: reach out to me.

03:20:36.260 --> 03:20:41.840
[Guest]: But some of these like imposter syndrome, the kundi thing, these things women are quite

03:20:41.840 --> 03:20:46.520
[Guest]: comfortable discussing in the open and you know, nobody really, like you said, men take

03:20:46.520 --> 03:20:47.520
[Guest]: them for granted.

03:20:47.520 --> 03:20:48.520
[Guest]: Right?

03:20:48.520 --> 03:20:49.520
[Guest]: And men don't even listen to these stories.

03:20:49.520 --> 03:20:54.720
[Guest]: So women are actually, when you are approaching it with good faith and they trust you, they

03:20:54.720 --> 03:21:00.720
[Guest]: are quite open and I feel like women's conversations are far richer than men's conversation.

03:21:00.720 --> 03:21:04.000
[Guest]: Men will usually gather and even with their father and brother and best friend, they'll

03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:10.320
[Guest]: talk about sports and politics and banal stuff, which has no consequence really to your life

03:21:10.320 --> 03:21:11.320
[Guest]: immediately.

03:21:11.320 --> 03:21:17.520
[Guest]: But men often have very, I find, surface conversations, which is a pity because women's conversations

03:21:17.520 --> 03:21:24.960
[Guest]: are really rich and really, I mean, they open up and they trust and they share quite freely.

03:21:24.960 --> 03:21:28.680
[Amit Varma]: I want to double click on this because it's something I'm genuinely curious about in the

03:21:28.680 --> 03:21:34.280
[Amit Varma]: sense that many people have told me that this year, especially my episodes with women are

03:21:34.280 --> 03:21:39.480
[Amit Varma]: what they have found the most memorable in, you know, whether it's Shrayana or Minalji

03:21:39.480 --> 03:21:45.720
[Amit Varma]: or Nilanjana or Urvashi or Mukulika and so on and so forth, whereas the episodes with

03:21:45.720 --> 03:21:51.200
[Amit Varma]: men are all great, you know, they're engaging in good faith, they're, you know, sharing

03:21:51.200 --> 03:21:54.160
[Amit Varma]: a lot of insights, but not that same level.

03:21:54.160 --> 03:21:57.680
[Amit Varma]: And I kind of feel that there is something there that in many of these episodes where

03:21:57.680 --> 03:22:04.160
[Amit Varma]: I've just sat and spoken to a woman for five hours, there is, you know, these people have

03:22:04.160 --> 03:22:10.600
[Amit Varma]: left the filter, just spoken with such raw honesty, and gone really deep and all of that.

03:22:10.600 --> 03:22:17.200
[Amit Varma]: And I'm trying to figure out why this is because what you say about conversations is also,

03:22:17.200 --> 03:22:18.200
[Amit Varma]: of course, quite true.

03:22:18.200 --> 03:22:22.560
[Amit Varma]: Most of the time, you know, men are kind of are talking about sports and whatever and

03:22:22.560 --> 03:22:26.900
[Amit Varma]: all of that, like you pointed out, the conversations can stay shallow.

03:22:26.900 --> 03:22:31.640
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just thinking aloud here, but I'd love to sort of ask you to sort of elaborate

03:22:31.640 --> 03:22:35.440
[Amit Varma]: not just on the what of it, but also the why of it.

03:22:35.440 --> 03:22:36.920
[Amit Varma]: Why do you think that happens?

03:22:36.920 --> 03:22:42.280
[Amit Varma]: Do you think that one thing that constrains that kind of deep conversation between men

03:22:42.280 --> 03:22:46.800
[Amit Varma]: is sort of this fear of intimacy, you know, that macho thing that you know, you will never

03:22:46.800 --> 03:22:50.600
[Amit Varma]: show your emotion, you will never show your vulnerability.

03:22:50.600 --> 03:22:55.320
[Amit Varma]: And I think part of any honest conversation between two people is when you let that guard

03:22:55.320 --> 03:22:58.520
[Amit Varma]: down and you're willing to show your vulnerability and you're willing to show when you're moved

03:22:58.520 --> 03:23:02.400
[Amit Varma]: by something or when you don't know something, or you're feeling lost and confused, and you're

03:23:02.400 --> 03:23:04.440
[Amit Varma]: willing to express that and men don't do that enough.

03:23:04.440 --> 03:23:08.680
[Amit Varma]: So I'm just thinking aloud that maybe that's one possible reason, but if you had to look

03:23:08.680 --> 03:23:11.080
[Amit Varma]: at the why of it, what would you sort of?

03:23:11.080 --> 03:23:13.480
[Guest]: Yeah, so it's a bit on both sides.

03:23:13.480 --> 03:23:16.960
[Guest]: And like I always say, you know, gender issues are not a men versus women issue.

03:23:16.960 --> 03:23:19.640
[Guest]: They are actually all of us are affected by them.

03:23:19.640 --> 03:23:21.520
[Guest]: You're rightly saying that.

03:23:21.520 --> 03:23:25.400
[Guest]: I think men are conditioned from an early age to, you know, hide their emotions, boys

03:23:25.400 --> 03:23:27.880
[Guest]: don't cry, and those things.

03:23:27.880 --> 03:23:34.000
[Guest]: So they're taught that it is weakness to show vulnerability, it is weakness to show and

03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:38.640
[Guest]: to accept your flaws or to discuss your failings.

03:23:38.640 --> 03:23:43.880
[Guest]: And so there is this burden, unnecessary burden in the modern age, which is put on men of

03:23:43.880 --> 03:23:50.040
[Guest]: – men are no longer sole breadwinners in most families, in this strata at least.

03:23:50.040 --> 03:23:54.840
[Guest]: And yet they have this burden of, I have to be the stoic supporter and carry this burden

03:23:54.840 --> 03:23:55.840
[Guest]: all by myself.

03:23:55.840 --> 03:23:56.840
[Guest]: They don't have to really.

03:23:56.840 --> 03:24:00.880
[Guest]: We can all be human beings with each other at this point, at least in families where

03:24:00.880 --> 03:24:06.000
[Guest]: there's otherwise financially secure, security is there, both are equal partners in terms

03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:09.560
[Guest]: of who's bringing in the dough and things like that.

03:24:09.560 --> 03:24:15.920
[Guest]: Even in relationships where the wife is a stay-at-home wife or mother.

03:24:15.920 --> 03:24:19.760
[Guest]: Even in those relationships, I'm saying that there is equal vulnerability that can be shown

03:24:19.760 --> 03:24:20.760
[Guest]: by both partners.

03:24:20.760 --> 03:24:26.480
[Guest]: It's not necessary anymore, but we are still somehow teaching our boys those problematic

03:24:26.480 --> 03:24:32.200
[Guest]: values and forcing them to hold up themselves to this unreal standard.

03:24:32.200 --> 03:24:36.080
[Guest]: So that's definitely a problem that affects men.

03:24:36.080 --> 03:24:42.560
[Guest]: And then I think on the women's side, there is a lot of feeling of not being heard enough

03:24:42.560 --> 03:24:46.920
[Guest]: in your own marriages, in your own homes, by your own family.

03:24:46.920 --> 03:24:53.200
[Guest]: So that also leads to women opening up more easily when they are given the chance.

03:24:53.200 --> 03:24:56.160
[Guest]: Because we are taught, we are silenced right from an early age.

03:24:56.160 --> 03:25:00.720
[Guest]: Like I said, you know, like, achi ladkiya zor se nahi hasti, achi ladkiya zyada nahi

03:25:00.720 --> 03:25:01.720
[Guest]: bolti.

03:25:01.720 --> 03:25:05.080
[Guest]: So these things are taught to us from a very early stage.

03:25:05.080 --> 03:25:08.000
[Guest]: And so we have bottled up a lot.

03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:15.080
[Guest]: And there is obviously much more disadvantage and discrimination that we are facing.

03:25:15.080 --> 03:25:19.480
[Guest]: And we have nowhere to voice it, at least not in our immediate relationships in most

03:25:19.480 --> 03:25:20.560
[Guest]: cases.

03:25:20.560 --> 03:25:26.080
[Guest]: So that's another reason why women kind of open up quite freely and with each other.

03:25:26.080 --> 03:25:30.120
[Guest]: And that is not new even, you know, I mean, even in I think my grandmom's generation,

03:25:30.120 --> 03:25:35.480
[Guest]: I have known aunts and all having this delicious conversation, which you would just want to

03:25:35.480 --> 03:25:39.960
[Guest]: be a fly on the wall and drink it all up ki achha yeh bhi hota tha family mein humein

03:25:39.960 --> 03:25:41.800
[Guest]: yeh pata hi nahi tha, like stuff like that.

03:25:41.800 --> 03:25:49.040
[Guest]: And men are talking about OLD and, sorry, what was it, ODL and all those things.

03:25:49.040 --> 03:25:54.920
[Guest]: So there, that's what it's, it's that difference has been there forever of women's conversation

03:25:54.920 --> 03:25:55.920
[Guest]: being more rich.

03:25:55.920 --> 03:26:01.280
[Guest]: And it's a, it's a issue, I think, on both sides.

03:26:01.280 --> 03:26:05.920
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about how you sort of arrived at your voice for the newsletter.

03:26:05.920 --> 03:26:09.520
[Amit Varma]: Because one of the things I really like about it, and I think I mentioned this at the start

03:26:09.520 --> 03:26:15.440
[Amit Varma]: when you asked for my feedback, is one, of course, is a personal tone, which makes the

03:26:15.440 --> 03:26:17.600
[Amit Varma]: reader relate to what you're talking about.

03:26:17.600 --> 03:26:25.120
[Amit Varma]: But also, you've managed to find just the right balance of lightness and seriousness

03:26:25.120 --> 03:26:26.120
[Amit Varma]: within that.

03:26:26.120 --> 03:26:30.400
[Amit Varma]: And part of how you do this is also by using memes creatively, you see, if you've written

03:26:30.400 --> 03:26:33.960
[Amit Varma]: a book, you won't have been able to use GIFs in it and all that.

03:26:33.960 --> 03:26:34.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:26:34.960 --> 03:26:36.060
[Amit Varma]: And there is a danger of overdoing that.

03:26:36.060 --> 03:26:38.560
[Amit Varma]: But in your case, it's just the right light touch.

03:26:38.560 --> 03:26:42.320
[Amit Varma]: You put it there, but you put it there in such a way that it kind of makes you smile,

03:26:42.320 --> 03:26:45.560
[Amit Varma]: but it doesn't trivialize the subject, and then you're kind of going on with it.

03:26:45.560 --> 03:26:47.800
[Amit Varma]: So how did you sort of arrive at this voice?

03:26:47.800 --> 03:26:49.880
[Amit Varma]: What was your thinking behind it?

03:26:49.880 --> 03:26:54.960
[Amit Varma]: Like how intentional was it ki mujhe yeh karna hai isliye?

03:26:54.960 --> 03:26:58.600
[Guest]: So one thing was that humor has always been a part of my life.

03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:03.280
[Guest]: It's when I'm growing up, my dad was a very funny guy, he used to be laughing a lot.

03:27:03.280 --> 03:27:06.120
[Guest]: My brother is probably the funniest person I know.

03:27:06.120 --> 03:27:12.640
[Guest]: So there was always humor as a coping mechanism, as a defense mechanism, there is a lot of

03:27:12.640 --> 03:27:17.520
[Guest]: humor in the family, in my personality.

03:27:17.520 --> 03:27:20.440
[Guest]: Probably not the most world-class jokes, but it is.

03:27:20.440 --> 03:27:23.680
[Guest]: Yaar tum kaise yeh phir, humor me bhi imposter syndrome.

03:27:23.680 --> 03:27:25.040
[Guest]: I know, it's terrible.

03:27:25.040 --> 03:27:26.400
[Guest]: So much unlearning needed.

03:27:26.400 --> 03:27:30.000
[Guest]: Anyway, so humor has always been a big part of my life.

03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:31.680
[Guest]: So for me, that was also important.

03:27:31.680 --> 03:27:36.560
[Guest]: I like it when people say that, you know, your writing made me laugh or even chuckle

03:27:36.560 --> 03:27:38.080
[Guest]: or even smile.

03:27:38.080 --> 03:27:43.520
[Guest]: And these are, like we've discussed, these are difficult topics, sometimes heavy topics.

03:27:43.520 --> 03:27:49.840
[Guest]: And I also want my audience to keep wanting to come back and, you know, I've myself read

03:27:49.840 --> 03:27:57.080
[Guest]: so many writings about gender which make you feel depressed and make you feel sad and hopeless

03:27:57.080 --> 03:28:00.440
[Guest]: about life and you don't want to go back there.

03:28:00.440 --> 03:28:04.880
[Guest]: There are serious issues and people have tackled them in serious voices.

03:28:04.880 --> 03:28:11.760
[Guest]: And as a person with a taste that prefers lightness and prefers entertainment, for me,

03:28:11.760 --> 03:28:18.200
[Guest]: I have not been able to watch a certain movie, for example, if it's very serious and very

03:28:18.200 --> 03:28:24.600
[Guest]: stark in your face, horrible realities of life, dekho kitna dard, toh wo mere se nahi

03:28:24.600 --> 03:28:26.120
[Guest]: hota as a consumer.

03:28:26.120 --> 03:28:31.480
[Guest]: I am not able to consume that and I find it that it disturbs my mental balance, sanity

03:28:31.480 --> 03:28:32.480
[Guest]: and everything.

03:28:32.480 --> 03:28:37.280
[Guest]: So I didn't want to inflict that on my readers, even though I'm talking about difficult subjects.

03:28:37.280 --> 03:28:43.800
[Guest]: So that was a definite choice there that it has to be funny, but again, with the right

03:28:43.800 --> 03:28:47.960
[Guest]: balance of somehow in a way that doesn't trivialize it.

03:28:47.960 --> 03:28:49.960
[Guest]: And then Bollywood, like I said, I'm a fan.

03:28:49.960 --> 03:28:54.720
[Guest]: It's been a part of a constant backdrop to my life growing up.

03:28:54.720 --> 03:28:58.800
[Guest]: So that is what came naturally to me.

03:28:58.800 --> 03:29:05.040
[Guest]: And everyone says that, I think you also said that in your writing course, that don't look

03:29:05.040 --> 03:29:08.760
[Guest]: for the thing that you'll be the first person to write, that duniya mein kisi ne is baare

03:29:08.760 --> 03:29:11.760
[Guest]: mein aaj tak lika, I'll be the one who'll introduce this to humanity.

03:29:11.760 --> 03:29:15.720
[Guest]: Aisa wait karoge toh you'll never find a chapter, any subject to write about because everything

03:29:15.720 --> 03:29:18.240
[Guest]: has been touched upon by someone or the other.

03:29:18.240 --> 03:29:20.260
[Guest]: But you are the only you in the world.

03:29:20.260 --> 03:29:24.700
[Guest]: So your experiences, your lived experiences, your personality is what you bring to it.

03:29:24.700 --> 03:29:29.440
[Guest]: So for me, it was also a conscious choice that I should write in a way that I talk to

03:29:29.440 --> 03:29:30.440
[Guest]: a friend.

03:29:30.440 --> 03:29:34.600
[Guest]: I should write in the way that I normally would interact with people.

03:29:34.600 --> 03:29:36.920
[Guest]: That's bringing my personality to it.

03:29:36.920 --> 03:29:41.560
[Guest]: And so this was the most entertaining way that I could come up with.

03:29:41.560 --> 03:29:43.720
[Guest]: And it does evolve with time.

03:29:43.720 --> 03:29:49.520
[Guest]: Sometimes there are very serious topics which I just cannot at all introduce any humor in.

03:29:49.520 --> 03:29:53.800
[Guest]: Like I've written about domestic violence, miscarriages, abortions, these are not subjects

03:29:53.800 --> 03:29:57.280
[Guest]: in which you can bring in Bollywood gifs.

03:29:57.280 --> 03:30:02.640
[Guest]: But for the most part, other subjects, which are a part of everyday life, there is a lot

03:30:02.640 --> 03:30:07.640
[Guest]: of satire, sarcasm, gifs, memes, and people have appreciated a lot.

03:30:07.640 --> 03:30:11.440
[Guest]: Like my readers, when they write back to me, they say that, you know, I love the way you

03:30:11.440 --> 03:30:15.760
[Guest]: highlight these things and I want to, and it makes me want to keep coming back for more.

03:30:15.760 --> 03:30:18.140
[Guest]: And that's basically mission accomplished, right?

03:30:18.140 --> 03:30:22.920
[Guest]: That a person did not feel turned off by the gruesome realities of life and wants to actually

03:30:22.920 --> 03:30:24.080
[Guest]: read more about it.

03:30:24.080 --> 03:30:29.640
[Guest]: And sort of like the, that's what this is.

03:30:29.640 --> 03:30:31.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, absolutely.

03:30:31.360 --> 03:30:35.840
[Amit Varma]: And I just love the way you, you know, start so many posts, just by saying, hello ji, you

03:30:35.840 --> 03:30:40.760
[Amit Varma]: know, which is sort of, so immediately one hears your voice and then, you know, it just

03:30:40.760 --> 03:30:41.760
[Amit Varma]: kind of flows naturally.

03:30:41.760 --> 03:30:43.200
[Amit Varma]: And there's a lot of humor in it also.

03:30:43.200 --> 03:30:47.480
[Amit Varma]: Maybe at some point as we talk about the individual subjects, I'll quote some of it.

03:30:47.480 --> 03:30:52.520
[Amit Varma]: Now, before we get to talking about some of the subjects you've tackled, and I actually

03:30:52.520 --> 03:30:57.680
[Amit Varma]: very deliberately want to go subject by subject and talk about a whole bunch of them, because

03:30:57.680 --> 03:31:03.560
[Amit Varma]: I think that many of them will be eye opening for many people or something that all of them

03:31:03.560 --> 03:31:06.040
[Amit Varma]: merit being spoken about.

03:31:06.040 --> 03:31:13.240
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I figured that to you, they might seem hey, you know, normal and the stuff

03:31:13.240 --> 03:31:18.640
[Amit Varma]: of everyday life and what's the big deal about it, but I just feel it all bears talking about

03:31:18.640 --> 03:31:23.800
[Amit Varma]: because what they have in common is that it is both something that is in front of us and

03:31:23.800 --> 03:31:25.360
[Amit Varma]: yet we do not see it.

03:31:25.360 --> 03:31:31.240
[Amit Varma]: So for that reason alone, but before we go there, one sort of final meta question in

03:31:31.240 --> 03:31:38.080
[Amit Varma]: terms of how has the response to womaning in India been from people?

03:31:38.080 --> 03:31:40.360
[Amit Varma]: How has the response been from women?

03:31:40.360 --> 03:31:43.600
[Amit Varma]: And I would imagine there are two kinds of responses from men.

03:31:43.600 --> 03:31:48.680
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, tell me a little bit about these responses and, you know, how they've come

03:31:48.680 --> 03:31:50.440
[Amit Varma]: your way, what they've meant to you.

03:31:50.440 --> 03:31:51.440
[Guest]: Okay.

03:31:51.440 --> 03:31:56.800
[Guest]: So I think we discussed this yesterday when we were talking about what we'll talk about.

03:31:56.800 --> 03:32:00.160
[Guest]: And I said that there's a whole unseen part of womaning that we should talk about, which

03:32:00.160 --> 03:32:05.160
[Guest]: is what is not published out there, what happens after I put out a piece.

03:32:05.160 --> 03:32:09.120
[Guest]: And it's always like my favorite time is right after I've put a piece out because that's

03:32:09.120 --> 03:32:15.720
[Guest]: when the responses start coming in and somebody will write a long email back to me.

03:32:15.720 --> 03:32:17.640
[Guest]: Somebody will send me a WhatsApp message.

03:32:17.640 --> 03:32:21.680
[Guest]: Somebody will write, retweet on Twitter with a comment of their own.

03:32:21.680 --> 03:32:25.640
[Guest]: And often, sometimes it's even happened that, you know, I put out a piece with five stories

03:32:25.640 --> 03:32:29.920
[Guest]: and then the most stark story has come back as feedback to me that, oh, you know, this

03:32:29.920 --> 03:32:30.920
[Guest]: happened to me too.

03:32:30.920 --> 03:32:31.920
[Guest]: And by the way, here's what happened.

03:32:31.920 --> 03:32:35.000
[Guest]: And I was like, my God, this is the story which should have been the centerpiece of

03:32:35.000 --> 03:32:36.360
[Guest]: what I wrote.

03:32:36.360 --> 03:32:39.920
[Guest]: And so I love the feedback I get because it's often very personal.

03:32:39.920 --> 03:32:45.720
[Guest]: It's not just that thumbs up, it's not just that, it's very, very personal.

03:32:45.720 --> 03:32:48.880
[Guest]: It's that, you know, this happened to me in my life.

03:32:48.880 --> 03:32:54.240
[Guest]: My mother-in-law said this, my father said that, my boss said this, my colleague did

03:32:54.240 --> 03:32:55.240
[Guest]: that.

03:32:55.240 --> 03:33:00.080
[Guest]: And people, especially women, will connect with real examples from their life.

03:33:00.080 --> 03:33:04.200
[Guest]: And you mentioned men have two types of responses.

03:33:04.200 --> 03:33:07.160
[Guest]: Actually, men have one type of response and women have two.

03:33:07.160 --> 03:33:09.760
[Guest]: That was a surprise for me as well.

03:33:09.760 --> 03:33:15.160
[Guest]: So men will, the one response I get is appreciation from men because the rest of the men will

03:33:15.160 --> 03:33:16.600
[Guest]: ignore it.

03:33:16.600 --> 03:33:20.000
[Guest]: It's very easy to ignore things, right, when you are living in a privileged life.

03:33:20.000 --> 03:33:21.920
[Guest]: Like we spoke about caste.

03:33:21.920 --> 03:33:27.120
[Guest]: Now I used to really pride myself for a long part of my life that I don't even know what

03:33:27.120 --> 03:33:28.680
[Guest]: caste I belong to.

03:33:28.680 --> 03:33:29.680
[Guest]: Such a matter of pride.

03:33:29.680 --> 03:33:34.880
[Guest]: So I am such an un-castist, but then later I realized that it's a privilege that is available

03:33:34.880 --> 03:33:40.080
[Guest]: only to upper caste people that, or forward caste people that you don't know what caste

03:33:40.080 --> 03:33:41.080
[Guest]: you are.

03:33:41.080 --> 03:33:45.320
[Guest]: If you are from a backward caste, you will be made aware of your caste by the world,

03:33:45.320 --> 03:33:46.320
[Guest]: right.

03:33:46.320 --> 03:33:49.720
[Guest]: So just the fact that you don't know what caste you are defines, shows what caste you

03:33:49.720 --> 03:33:51.640
[Guest]: are and it's a privilege.

03:33:51.640 --> 03:33:55.600
[Guest]: And there's so much happening around me at all times, which has to do with caste, which

03:33:55.600 --> 03:34:00.240
[Guest]: I don't even see because my privilege has made my life a smooth highway, why should

03:34:00.240 --> 03:34:03.520
[Guest]: I think about the ubad khabad rast on the side, right.

03:34:03.520 --> 03:34:07.200
[Guest]: And that's how I also think about what it must be like for men.

03:34:07.200 --> 03:34:11.720
[Guest]: So even, like I said, the most well-meaning men, their life is so comfortable with all

03:34:11.720 --> 03:34:16.080
[Guest]: these privileges that they don't even know they have, that there, what is the incentive?

03:34:16.080 --> 03:34:20.560
[Guest]: Why should they worry about other people living a more difficult life?

03:34:20.560 --> 03:34:24.520
[Guest]: Of course, yes, one incentive is that these other people are your own wife, your own mother,

03:34:24.520 --> 03:34:28.000
[Guest]: your daughter, our mothers and sisters.

03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:33.340
[Guest]: But other than that, if you just think about it as the comfort of privilege, it happens

03:34:33.340 --> 03:34:37.480
[Guest]: to all of us and we are all guilty of it, all of us who have our privilege on one axis

03:34:37.480 --> 03:34:38.560
[Guest]: or the other.

03:34:38.560 --> 03:34:42.600
[Guest]: So men will either ignore or because they are too privileged and why should they care

03:34:42.600 --> 03:34:46.480
[Guest]: about a woman writer or the ones who read are genuinely, they send me things like, you

03:34:46.480 --> 03:34:51.520
[Guest]: know, this is an education, I look forward to it every week, every week you make me aware

03:34:51.520 --> 03:34:56.320
[Guest]: of something that I never thought about, and they've been super supportive.

03:34:56.320 --> 03:35:01.400
[Guest]: There's a friend who is a CEO running his own firm now, and he read the post I wrote

03:35:01.400 --> 03:35:06.280
[Guest]: about lack of women friendly infrastructure in workplaces.

03:35:06.280 --> 03:35:10.540
[Guest]: And he said, I'm installing sanitary pad vending machines in my office toilet.

03:35:10.540 --> 03:35:13.840
[Guest]: As soon as I finished reading this post, I was like, I'm doing this right now.

03:35:13.840 --> 03:35:19.880
[Guest]: So you know, I've had such tangible impact from my readers and male readers have been

03:35:19.880 --> 03:35:23.080
[Guest]: nothing but kind because those who are unkind will not read.

03:35:23.080 --> 03:35:26.300
[Guest]: Women on the other hand have had a polar opposite response.

03:35:26.300 --> 03:35:32.760
[Guest]: So one is, of course, a vast majority of women who support it, who love it, who say that,

03:35:32.760 --> 03:35:37.160
[Guest]: you know, it felt like you were speaking my words, this is what I always wanted to say,

03:35:37.160 --> 03:35:40.160
[Guest]: it was like reading my own inner voice.

03:35:40.160 --> 03:35:44.160
[Guest]: And I'm so happy you gave voice to this particular thing, because this really bothered me and

03:35:44.160 --> 03:35:49.280
[Guest]: like I said, a lot of personal stories and very rich love that I get from them.

03:35:49.280 --> 03:35:54.280
[Guest]: And then there are women who are offended, like violently offended by it.

03:35:54.280 --> 03:36:00.040
[Guest]: I've had women shout at me on the phone, that tum kar kya rahe ho, tum kya likhna chahate

03:36:00.040 --> 03:36:03.720
[Guest]: ho, kya kar rahi ho tum, you are corrupting the minds of people.

03:36:03.720 --> 03:36:09.080
[Guest]: And I've had women like shout at me and I've had visceral violent responses to womaning.

03:36:09.080 --> 03:36:15.040
[Guest]: And I've always wondered that, you know, going in even I thought like you said just now that

03:36:15.040 --> 03:36:17.640
[Guest]: men might hate it, but most women will like it.

03:36:17.640 --> 03:36:22.160
[Guest]: And then when I thought about it deeper, I thought, you know, these are often women who

03:36:22.160 --> 03:36:30.960
[Guest]: have lived for years and decades in that restricted lifestyle and in that prison of gender roles,

03:36:30.960 --> 03:36:36.880
[Guest]: ki main aurat ho mera kaam hai, Diwali ke din khade hoke sab ke liye pakode dalna or

03:36:36.880 --> 03:36:37.880
[Guest]: whatever.

03:36:37.880 --> 03:36:42.960
[Guest]: The XYZ gender role has been a part of their identity for so many decades and they've lived

03:36:42.960 --> 03:36:48.160
[Guest]: it for so many decades that now if you question it, it makes them feel like I lived my life

03:36:48.160 --> 03:36:54.720
[Guest]: wrong or I could have lived it better or, you know, this piece of writing is highlighting

03:36:54.720 --> 03:36:59.440
[Guest]: something that has gone terribly wrong with my life and I don't want to pull on that thread.

03:36:59.440 --> 03:37:02.960
[Guest]: So that's why women often have a very visceral response.

03:37:02.960 --> 03:37:08.160
[Guest]: So my strongest, harshest critics have been women, not men.

03:37:08.160 --> 03:37:09.160
[Amit Varma]: That's very strange.

03:37:09.160 --> 03:37:10.800
[Amit Varma]: So like, how do they get in touch with you?

03:37:10.800 --> 03:37:14.520
[Amit Varma]: Like when you mentioned that someone shouted at you on the phone, matlab ye interaction

03:37:14.520 --> 03:37:15.840
[Amit Varma]: shuru kaha se hoti hai?

03:37:15.840 --> 03:37:20.080
[Amit Varma]: Do they kind of cold call you or just connect with you or the blue just to tell you that

03:37:20.080 --> 03:37:21.080
[Amit Varma]: they hated it so much?

03:37:21.080 --> 03:37:25.280
[Guest]: No, so the cold hatred comes from via email or something.

03:37:25.280 --> 03:37:27.040
[Guest]: Sometimes angry mails will come.

03:37:27.040 --> 03:37:33.360
[Guest]: But ye phone call wala shouting happened because I was actually talking to a lady about some

03:37:33.360 --> 03:37:40.000
[Guest]: other story and then she said she was in her late 50s or 60s, early 60s.

03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:46.160
[Guest]: And she said that, you know, one issue that nobody talks about is late age care and how

03:37:46.160 --> 03:37:51.240
[Guest]: women are made responsible for caregiving for their in-laws, but not their parents.

03:37:51.240 --> 03:37:57.280
[Guest]: So at a very senior age, when a person is bedridden, has to be cleaned, has to be bathed,

03:37:57.280 --> 03:38:00.480
[Guest]: you have to do like very, very intimate care for that person.

03:38:00.480 --> 03:38:05.080
[Guest]: At that age, it will not be the son who will be asked to do that, it will be the daughter-in-law.

03:38:05.080 --> 03:38:08.920
[Guest]: Even though, if you think about it, our parents have cleaned our poop when we were kids, we

03:38:08.920 --> 03:38:11.440
[Guest]: should be the ones doing it for them when we grow up.

03:38:11.440 --> 03:38:15.040
[Guest]: But no, the men will not be asked to do it, their wives will be asked to do it.

03:38:15.040 --> 03:38:19.280
[Guest]: And conversely, the wives are not often allowed to do it for their own parents, because wahan

03:38:19.280 --> 03:38:21.280
[Guest]: ki bahu karegi wo kaam.

03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:26.480
[Guest]: Right, so this was a subject I hadn't thought of because stage of life, I have not reached

03:38:26.480 --> 03:38:30.720
[Guest]: that stage of life where you're caregiving for your parents.

03:38:30.720 --> 03:38:36.080
[Guest]: But I was like, oh wow, this is insightful, I've never thought of this, but I don't have

03:38:36.080 --> 03:38:39.920
[Guest]: enough friends in that age group either who are at that stage of life.

03:38:39.920 --> 03:38:44.200
[Guest]: So can you introduce me to some people who, some more women who will tell me more stories

03:38:44.200 --> 03:38:46.320
[Guest]: about this and I'll build a piece around it.

03:38:46.320 --> 03:38:50.560
[Guest]: So then she gave me numbers of some women and she said so and so is doing for her in-law,

03:38:50.560 --> 03:38:57.320
[Guest]: so and so has her own mother is in an old age home, but she's doing it for her father-in-law,

03:38:57.320 --> 03:38:58.320
[Guest]: something like that.

03:38:58.320 --> 03:39:01.520
[Guest]: So she gave me a couple of numbers and one of the numbers I called and that lady thought

03:39:01.520 --> 03:39:03.520
[Guest]: that somehow there was a miscommunication.

03:39:03.520 --> 03:39:08.760
[Guest]: She thought I'm calling to write a very positive story about what a great daughter-in-law she

03:39:08.760 --> 03:39:09.760
[Guest]: is.

03:39:09.760 --> 03:39:15.800
[Guest]: But when I asked her, I said, do you not feel ki aapko apni mother ko caregiving karne ka

03:39:15.800 --> 03:39:21.160
[Guest]: bhi haq hai, ya should your husband be the one contributing towards caregiving for your

03:39:21.160 --> 03:39:24.720
[Guest]: in-laws, at least contributing, if not doing it himself.

03:39:24.720 --> 03:39:29.840
[Guest]: There's no shame in caring for your parents-in-law, but why only one gender?

03:39:29.840 --> 03:39:35.320
[Guest]: So then I think the line of questioning was something I assumed she was expecting because

03:39:35.320 --> 03:39:40.520
[Guest]: there was an interlocutor between us who had told me that this person is at the same stage

03:39:40.520 --> 03:39:41.520
[Guest]: of life.

03:39:41.520 --> 03:39:42.520
[Guest]: But I suppose there was a miscommunication.

03:39:42.520 --> 03:39:47.160
[Guest]: So she did not at all agree with the point of view that I was coming to it with.

03:39:47.160 --> 03:39:52.160
[Guest]: So she was like, you have an agenda against women and against culture and society and

03:39:52.160 --> 03:39:59.960
[Guest]: so she scolded me a lot on the phone, so I said, sorry ma'am, you had a miscommunication,

03:39:59.960 --> 03:40:03.360
[Guest]: it's okay, I'm sorry, I hurt your feelings, I think we'll drop it here.

03:40:03.360 --> 03:40:07.920
[Guest]: Then I cut the call and then she sent me a lot of abuses on WhatsApp and a lot of other

03:40:07.920 --> 03:40:08.920
[Guest]: things.

03:40:08.920 --> 03:40:12.280
[Guest]: I mean, see, that's what I'm talking about, you don't, there are threads that people don't

03:40:12.280 --> 03:40:15.120
[Guest]: want you to pull at in their life.

03:40:15.120 --> 03:40:20.560
[Guest]: It's like the boss who got upset with me because I quit the service because he's in the service,

03:40:20.560 --> 03:40:21.560
[Guest]: right?

03:40:21.560 --> 03:40:22.560
[Guest]: So that is a criticism.

03:40:22.560 --> 03:40:25.480
[Guest]: It's a statement I'm making on his life choices.

03:40:25.480 --> 03:40:30.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I remember once I'd written this column about how it is immoral to have children,

03:40:30.760 --> 03:40:31.760
[Amit Varma]: right?

03:40:31.760 --> 03:40:35.400
[Amit Varma]: Partly meant to be provocative, but the argument, of course, is flawless.

03:40:35.400 --> 03:40:40.480
[Amit Varma]: The argument basically being that you should not do something to people without their consent

03:40:40.480 --> 03:40:44.080
[Amit Varma]: and it is wrong to cause people pain or to kill them.

03:40:44.080 --> 03:40:48.320
[Amit Varma]: And basically, when you're having kids, you are guaranteeing that they will feel pain

03:40:48.320 --> 03:40:51.600
[Amit Varma]: and they will die and there is no way of taking their consent and therefore it's wrong.

03:40:51.600 --> 03:40:53.640
[Amit Varma]: So that was my provocative argument.

03:40:53.640 --> 03:40:57.120
[Amit Varma]: And I've never got trolled by anyone like I've been trolled by the right, I've been

03:40:57.120 --> 03:41:00.800
[Amit Varma]: trolled by the left, I've been trolled by Shahrukh Khan fans, I've been trolled on religious

03:41:00.800 --> 03:41:01.800
[Amit Varma]: grounds.

03:41:01.800 --> 03:41:04.840
[Amit Varma]: No one has told me like parents suddenly came out and trolled me.

03:41:04.840 --> 03:41:05.840
[Unknown]: Yeah.

03:41:05.840 --> 03:41:09.840
[Amit Varma]: And I was just thinking that, hey, you know, why are you taking it so personally, you know,

03:41:09.840 --> 03:41:13.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, people make choices.

03:41:13.920 --> 03:41:20.160
[Amit Varma]: And which is also, by the way, something that you've kind of written about elsewhere.

03:41:20.160 --> 03:41:22.360
[Amit Varma]: And we'll kind of come to that.

03:41:22.360 --> 03:41:27.800
[Amit Varma]: So like, I was sort of looking at all your posts, and they seem to be fitting in a bunch

03:41:27.800 --> 03:41:33.160
[Amit Varma]: of broad categories, like, you know, women having to conform to stereotypes, women living

03:41:33.160 --> 03:41:38.520
[Amit Varma]: in a world designed for men, violence and women, you know, what only women go through,

03:41:38.520 --> 03:41:41.200
[Amit Varma]: women hobbling themselves, and so on and so forth.

03:41:41.200 --> 03:41:45.960
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned that the way that you prefer to think about them is what women go through

03:41:45.960 --> 03:41:51.760
[Amit Varma]: in offices, what women go through in public spaces, what women go through at home.

03:41:51.760 --> 03:41:56.520
[Amit Varma]: So you know, which of these categories should we sort of start talking about and addressing?

03:41:56.520 --> 03:41:57.520
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:41:57.520 --> 03:42:00.800
[Amit Varma]: And the fourth is your own image, self image, your own self image and your interior.

03:42:00.800 --> 03:42:03.560
[Guest]: We also like imposter syndrome is the best example, right?

03:42:03.560 --> 03:42:06.240
[Guest]: The way we think about ourselves is also colored by gender.

03:42:06.240 --> 03:42:07.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:42:07.240 --> 03:42:09.160
[Amit Varma]: Let's start with workplace.

03:42:09.160 --> 03:42:10.320
[Amit Varma]: Let's start with workplace.

03:42:10.320 --> 03:42:16.240
[Amit Varma]: You have a great post, which asks the question, can women even do jobs?

03:42:16.240 --> 03:42:21.920
[Amit Varma]: And you know, so tell me a little bit about the stereotypes that kind of apply here, about

03:42:21.920 --> 03:42:26.320
[Amit Varma]: the kind of jobs that women can do or can't do.

03:42:26.320 --> 03:42:31.880
[Amit Varma]: And once they do have a job, what they are expected to, you know, what is their role,

03:42:31.880 --> 03:42:34.040
[Guest]: what their role typically becomes within offices?

03:42:34.040 --> 03:42:35.040
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:42:35.040 --> 03:42:40.280
[Guest]: So what kind of jobs women have, we have the same kind of jobs that men do, right?

03:42:40.280 --> 03:42:45.800
[Guest]: But there is a well documented phenomena called the brilliance bias, which is that when I

03:42:45.800 --> 03:42:51.160
[Guest]: ask you to think of 10 brilliant people, you will probably name 9 men.

03:42:51.160 --> 03:42:53.320
[Guest]: And most people will name 10 men.

03:42:53.320 --> 03:42:56.600
[Guest]: Because we think that brilliance is a very male trait.

03:42:56.600 --> 03:43:01.560
[Guest]: And for reasons that we've discussed before, like nobody knows the name of Einstein's wife.

03:43:01.560 --> 03:43:03.160
[Guest]: She's as brilliant as he was.

03:43:03.160 --> 03:43:08.720
[Guest]: But brilliance bias, we think that Einstein is the, history has also taught us that Einstein

03:43:08.720 --> 03:43:12.960
[Guest]: was, the history is paved by great big men, right?

03:43:12.960 --> 03:43:18.480
[Guest]: So therefore, there is an assumption when a man does a job that he is competent to do

03:43:18.480 --> 03:43:21.240
[Guest]: that job, fair or unfair.

03:43:21.240 --> 03:43:27.080
[Guest]: And there is, but when a woman is in the same position, and has come to it through the same

03:43:27.080 --> 03:43:32.080
[Guest]: channel, by the way, having overcome many hurdles, which are unseen, she's constantly

03:43:32.080 --> 03:43:34.960
[Guest]: expected to prove her competence to do that job.

03:43:34.960 --> 03:43:40.240
[Guest]: So this happens, especially in STEM, where brilliance bias is the most in science, technology

03:43:40.240 --> 03:43:43.640
[Guest]: engineering, mathematics, where it's a male dominated field.

03:43:43.640 --> 03:43:46.920
[Guest]: And over and over women are asked, can you do this?

03:43:46.920 --> 03:43:47.920
[Guest]: Are you able to do this?

03:43:47.920 --> 03:43:55.960
[Guest]: I've spoken to women who are senior data scientists in big companies, Google and all and who've

03:43:55.960 --> 03:43:59.960
[Guest]: had youngsters come up to them and explain what is HTTP.

03:43:59.960 --> 03:44:03.800
[Guest]: Young men will come and say like, aapko toh bata nahi hoga, main bata deta ho, like that.

03:44:03.800 --> 03:44:07.640
[Guest]: So it's not even, it's a cross hierarchy, like it's not even that you will respect a

03:44:07.640 --> 03:44:09.560
[Guest]: person because they're more senior to you.

03:44:09.560 --> 03:44:14.680
[Guest]: Because she's a woman, you'll assume that she doesn't know what she's doing, or she's

03:44:14.680 --> 03:44:19.020
[Guest]: here because of some other reasons, not because of her competence.

03:44:19.020 --> 03:44:26.240
[Guest]: So that's a pain point that women have, in many different aspects of their jobs, reiterated

03:44:26.240 --> 03:44:29.400
[Guest]: that it's assumed that I don't know how to do my job.

03:44:29.400 --> 03:44:30.720
[Guest]: And this plays out in many ways.

03:44:30.720 --> 03:44:36.200
[Guest]: So one very interesting thing that a woman told me, which I'm yet to write about is failure,

03:44:36.200 --> 03:44:37.960
[Guest]: the permission to fail.

03:44:37.960 --> 03:44:41.760
[Guest]: Men have the permission to fail over and over again, and will be given many more chances

03:44:41.760 --> 03:44:43.160
[Guest]: to fail than a woman.

03:44:43.160 --> 03:44:47.960
[Guest]: If as a woman you fail once, immediately you'll be labeled ke, because iska bacha isliye ye

03:44:47.960 --> 03:44:52.160
[Guest]: fail hui, because iski shaadi hone waliye isliye ye fail hui, because she's single isliye ye

03:44:52.160 --> 03:44:54.040
[Guest]: fail hui, koi bhi cheez ho jayegi.

03:44:54.040 --> 03:44:58.880
[Guest]: And somehow it'll be, that failure will become your, will be associated with you for life.

03:44:58.880 --> 03:45:01.720
[Guest]: So women don't have that much scope to fail.

03:45:01.720 --> 03:45:06.240
[Guest]: Women also don't have access to mentors at work for this reason, because either male

03:45:06.240 --> 03:45:10.160
[Guest]: mentors are creepy themselves, or there is an assumption that there's something creepy

03:45:10.160 --> 03:45:13.560
[Guest]: going on between a male mentor and female mentee.

03:45:13.560 --> 03:45:18.480
[Guest]: Even if it's completely harmless between them, people will perceive it in a very different

03:45:18.480 --> 03:45:21.200
[Guest]: way than that relationship between two men.

03:45:21.200 --> 03:45:24.020
[Guest]: What you spoke about, what kind of jobs they end up doing.

03:45:24.020 --> 03:45:27.000
[Guest]: So that's a post I wrote about, are you the office mom?

03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:32.160
[Guest]: So this has happened to me, it has happened to many women, that lunch ka time hai to,

03:45:32.160 --> 03:45:35.240
[Guest]: arey, Mahima ko do na menu, she will order.

03:45:35.240 --> 03:45:43.320
[Guest]: Women are better at this, or, achha, so and so, wo hai, kuch organize karna hai, get together,

03:45:43.320 --> 03:45:48.280
[Guest]: ya outing, chalo, Mahima aap karo na, ladies are better at this creative stuff, aap log

03:45:48.280 --> 03:45:49.280
[Guest]: creative hote ho.

03:45:49.280 --> 03:45:53.760
[Guest]: So it'll be wrapped up in a compliment, but it is ultimately that this is not a job good

03:45:53.760 --> 03:45:55.320
[Guest]: enough for us to do.

03:45:55.320 --> 03:45:57.320
[Guest]: So you be the office mom.

03:45:57.320 --> 03:46:03.400
[Guest]: And so women are often taking notes at meetings, women will be the one running a PPT, down

03:46:03.400 --> 03:46:08.280
[Guest]: down down button press karne ka gaam maine bhi bahut ki hai, PMO ba jaa ke bhi ki hai,

03:46:08.280 --> 03:46:11.160
[Guest]: Prime Minister exam le bhi peeche baith ke down button press ki hai.

03:46:11.160 --> 03:46:16.400
[Guest]: So like, this is often the task for which women are chosen, we make good secretaries

03:46:16.400 --> 03:46:22.200
[Guest]: according to, and you can be at any level of seniority or professional achievement,

03:46:22.200 --> 03:46:24.560
[Guest]: these tasks will come to women.

03:46:24.560 --> 03:46:27.440
[Guest]: Another is being heard in meetings.

03:46:27.440 --> 03:46:31.360
[Guest]: So another thing that has also personally happened to me, and I've written a post about

03:46:31.360 --> 03:46:36.060
[Guest]: it, that people, and not just men, people suffer from selective deafness.

03:46:36.060 --> 03:46:42.560
[Guest]: So the chair of a meeting, whether it is a man or a woman, will give more weightage and

03:46:42.560 --> 03:46:47.040
[Guest]: attention to a man speaking than he or she does to a woman speaking.

03:46:47.040 --> 03:46:51.960
[Guest]: So it's happened to me that I've been talking and somebody will interrupt me suddenly and

03:46:51.960 --> 03:46:56.760
[Guest]: talk over me and the entire room's attention shifts to that person very seamlessly as if

03:46:56.760 --> 03:47:01.160
[Guest]: I, and makes me question, was I even talking, did I imagine that I was talking.

03:47:01.160 --> 03:47:06.200
[Guest]: People have repeated what I've said, sometimes with a little creativity and they are given

03:47:06.200 --> 03:47:09.000
[Guest]: credit for the idea that I had proposed.

03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:12.560
[Guest]: I had a colleague to whom I actually had a conversation with, he was a nice guy, but

03:47:12.560 --> 03:47:15.120
[Guest]: he used to interrupt me a lot and talk over me.

03:47:15.120 --> 03:47:18.880
[Guest]: So because he was a nice guy, I thought, let me try having a rational conversation.

03:47:18.880 --> 03:47:22.600
[Guest]: So outside the meeting room, once I told him that, listen, you know, you do this.

03:47:22.600 --> 03:47:26.320
[Guest]: And he was like, no, I don't do this, what are you talking about, very full denial.

03:47:26.320 --> 03:47:29.720
[Guest]: And then next time I was talking in a meeting and he did this.

03:47:29.720 --> 03:47:32.240
[Guest]: And then I just looked at him and I gave him a smile.

03:47:32.240 --> 03:47:36.000
[Guest]: And the horror that descended on his face, because then he realized that, oh my God,

03:47:36.000 --> 03:47:37.920
[Guest]: I was actually doing this to her.

03:47:37.920 --> 03:47:43.160
[Guest]: And people are doing it unconsciously, like by now we are conditioned to tune out a female

03:47:43.160 --> 03:47:49.000
[Guest]: sound meter, that there is some nonsense going on with the female pitch, there is something

03:47:49.000 --> 03:47:50.000
[Guest]: important going on with the male pitch.

03:47:50.000 --> 03:47:54.200
[Guest]: This is programmed in us, we are conditioned to accept this, both men and women.

03:47:54.200 --> 03:47:58.200
[Guest]: So it's all these ways in which it plays out, these biases about women's incompetence.

03:47:58.200 --> 03:48:04.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'm going to quote you a little bit, where, you know, in one of your posts, you've

03:48:04.360 --> 03:48:10.520
[Amit Varma]: spoken about, you know, how men are so much more assertive and how women are not even

03:48:10.520 --> 03:48:15.600
[Amit Varma]: allowed to be assertive, in the sense that you write, quote, men negotiate their roles

03:48:15.600 --> 03:48:16.640
[Amit Varma]: all the time.

03:48:16.640 --> 03:48:19.600
[Amit Varma]: Such men are called driven and focused and go getters.

03:48:19.600 --> 03:48:23.000
[Amit Varma]: But I personally experienced what happens when a woman tries the same.

03:48:23.000 --> 03:48:25.360
[Amit Varma]: You are either too meek or too aggressive.

03:48:25.360 --> 03:48:29.720
[Amit Varma]: I don't know any woman who has managed to hit that mythical sweet spot between the two.

03:48:29.720 --> 03:48:30.720
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

03:48:30.720 --> 03:48:36.520
[Amit Varma]: And later on in your post about selective deafness in meetings, you know, you give the

03:48:36.520 --> 03:48:41.000
[Amit Varma]: moral of the story as, quote, a woman who is quiet is incompetent.

03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:43.520
[Amit Varma]: A woman who speaks up is a fearsome terror.

03:48:43.520 --> 03:48:45.400
[Amit Varma]: There is no middle ground available.

03:48:45.400 --> 03:48:46.400
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

03:48:46.400 --> 03:48:52.200
[Amit Varma]: And you also quoted someone called Pallavi, who is giving her suggestion for how to deal

03:48:52.200 --> 03:48:53.200
[Amit Varma]: with this.

03:48:53.200 --> 03:48:57.440
[Amit Varma]: And her suggestion is that whenever you have a suggestion, frame it as a question.

03:48:57.440 --> 03:49:01.880
[Amit Varma]: So she says, quote, I started phrasing my opinions as questions to get heard.

03:49:01.880 --> 03:49:04.680
[Amit Varma]: I would intentionally sound stupid to make my point.

03:49:04.680 --> 03:49:08.840
[Amit Varma]: For example, if I found a big gap in their balance sheet or profit and loss statement,

03:49:08.840 --> 03:49:12.880
[Amit Varma]: instead of saying that is wrong, I would say, why do we put it that way?

03:49:12.880 --> 03:49:17.040
[Amit Varma]: And in the process of answering my stupid question, they would realize their mistake

03:49:17.040 --> 03:49:19.360
[Amit Varma]: and figure out what they needed to do to correct it.

03:49:19.360 --> 03:49:23.180
[Amit Varma]: Six months of this led to them making enormous changes, putting me in charge of reviews and

03:49:23.180 --> 03:49:25.840
[Amit Varma]: making sure I was part of every boardroom meeting.

03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:26.840
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

03:49:26.840 --> 03:49:30.680
[Amit Varma]: And at least she got her due in terms of, you know, her critical thinking recognized

03:49:30.680 --> 03:49:32.720
[Amit Varma]: and being part of every boardroom meeting.

03:49:32.720 --> 03:49:38.840
[Amit Varma]: But in general, you know, we've spoken about that added layer, which comes in when women

03:49:38.840 --> 03:49:40.480
[Amit Varma]: are experiencing the world.

03:49:40.480 --> 03:49:46.240
[Amit Varma]: But is there also an added layer, which women have to use when they are deciding how to

03:49:46.240 --> 03:49:47.760
[Amit Varma]: interact with the world?

03:49:47.760 --> 03:49:53.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, if I am saying something to anybody in a meeting or with a friend or whatever,

03:49:53.000 --> 03:49:57.760
[Amit Varma]: I won't have to think about how will this go down?

03:49:57.760 --> 03:49:59.360
[Amit Varma]: How will I be perceived?

03:49:59.360 --> 03:50:02.480
[Amit Varma]: Will I be perceived as too forward or too demanding or whatever?

03:50:02.480 --> 03:50:05.040
[Amit Varma]: I don't need to think like that, I'll just say it.

03:50:05.040 --> 03:50:09.560
[Amit Varma]: Is that a layer also that women always have with them that you have to actually think

03:50:09.560 --> 03:50:14.440
[Amit Varma]: about how your words will be perceived, not just what you are saying?

03:50:14.440 --> 03:50:15.440
[Guest]: 100%, 200%.

03:50:15.440 --> 03:50:21.440
[Guest]: I mean, I think I spend more time thinking about how I'll be perceived than the content

03:50:21.440 --> 03:50:22.440
[Guest]: of what I have to say.

03:50:22.440 --> 03:50:25.960
[Guest]: I'm usually quite clear on what my opinion is on things.

03:50:25.960 --> 03:50:28.360
[Guest]: But the packaging is where most of my energy goes.

03:50:28.360 --> 03:50:29.560
[Guest]: And that's true of most women.

03:50:29.560 --> 03:50:34.520
[Guest]: Like you gave the example of Pallavi, yeah, I mean, it's a success story in one way, but

03:50:34.520 --> 03:50:39.560
[Guest]: to me, it's also extremely unfortunate that somebody has to package their intelligent

03:50:39.560 --> 03:50:41.760
[Amit Varma]: points as stupid questions in order to be heard.

03:50:41.760 --> 03:50:46.280
[Amit Varma]: Because so much energy goes in this shit, you know, she could be doing something more

03:50:46.280 --> 03:50:47.280
[Amit Varma]: productive for her.

03:50:47.280 --> 03:50:52.960
[Guest]: Yeah, no, I mean, I used to compare at one point, again, when this penny dropped, that

03:50:52.960 --> 03:50:54.600
[Guest]: is the expression.

03:50:54.600 --> 03:50:59.600
[Guest]: So when this penny drop for me was a moment when I suddenly realized that me and I had

03:50:59.600 --> 03:51:02.400
[Guest]: a male colleague, we were used to work at the same level.

03:51:02.400 --> 03:51:06.520
[Guest]: And I realized the kind of emails we write are so different, like, so suppose you are

03:51:06.520 --> 03:51:10.360
[Guest]: my colleague, and you have to say a meeting is postponed, you will write, dear so and

03:51:10.360 --> 03:51:14.640
[Guest]: so this meeting is postponed to 5.30pm, best Amit.

03:51:14.640 --> 03:51:20.040
[Guest]: That's the kind of email that my colleague used to write, I would write, dear sir, due

03:51:20.040 --> 03:51:26.720
[Guest]: to some unfortunate and unforeseen circumstances and technical issues we are facing, I apologize

03:51:26.720 --> 03:51:29.220
[Guest]: that this meeting has been postponed.

03:51:29.220 --> 03:51:31.400
[Guest]: It is now going to be scheduled at this time.

03:51:31.400 --> 03:51:33.760
[Guest]: I will keep you updated if there's a change.

03:51:33.760 --> 03:51:36.840
[Guest]: I apologize once again for the inconvenience.

03:51:36.840 --> 03:51:43.360
[Guest]: Warm regards, I always use warm because you have to, just regards also, rude, warm regards.

03:51:43.360 --> 03:51:47.840
[Guest]: So that's how I write emails and it's such a waste of my time and effort and energy and

03:51:47.840 --> 03:51:50.480
[Guest]: creative writing for such a simple message.

03:51:50.480 --> 03:51:54.280
[Guest]: And I would see his messages and I'd be like, dear, if I write such an email, I'll become

03:51:54.280 --> 03:51:57.840
[Guest]: famous within one week that this person writes rude emails.

03:51:57.840 --> 03:52:00.880
[Guest]: And this again has been shown, social experiments have been done.

03:52:00.880 --> 03:52:04.960
[Guest]: There have been people, I think there was an experiment where a woman wrote some emails

03:52:04.960 --> 03:52:09.240
[Guest]: as a man or a man wrote emails as a woman and they were perceived very differently and

03:52:09.240 --> 03:52:15.480
[Guest]: they were shocked by how a person who's perceived to be a woman, people take offense much quicker

03:52:15.480 --> 03:52:21.320
[Guest]: and will try to talk down to them, explain simple things to them like they're dumb.

03:52:21.320 --> 03:52:25.040
[Guest]: And when you perceive it's a man, suddenly the respect goes up.

03:52:25.040 --> 03:52:29.760
[Guest]: So these are all well-documented phenomena that we all experience and it's a huge waste

03:52:29.760 --> 03:52:35.680
[Guest]: of our time, effort, energy, but I have to do it in order to be seen as someone worthy

03:52:35.680 --> 03:52:38.520
[Guest]: of being listened to by people.

03:52:38.520 --> 03:52:39.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:52:39.520 --> 03:52:43.440
[Amit Varma]: And the phenomenon you've pointed out in meetings that women are always getting interrupted.

03:52:43.440 --> 03:52:48.280
[Amit Varma]: It's like you said, nothing at all, you'll say X and then some guy will say X and he'll

03:52:48.280 --> 03:52:49.640
[Amit Varma]: get the talis for it.

03:52:49.640 --> 03:52:52.920
[Amit Varma]: And I've noticed this even in panel discussions, like the next time you're on YouTube and you're

03:52:52.920 --> 03:52:57.900
[Amit Varma]: watching some panel discussion and there's a male moderator, just keep an eye on who

03:52:57.900 --> 03:52:59.920
[Amit Varma]: he's interrupting and how much.

03:52:59.920 --> 03:53:05.480
[Amit Varma]: And some people will of course interrupt everybody, but in general, women get just interrupted

03:53:05.480 --> 03:53:06.480
[Guest]: so much more.

03:53:06.480 --> 03:53:07.480
[Guest]: Absolutely.

03:53:07.480 --> 03:53:08.480
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:53:08.480 --> 03:53:09.480
[Guest]: No, I have that lens.

03:53:09.480 --> 03:53:10.480
[Guest]: So I do see that.

03:53:10.480 --> 03:53:12.840
[Guest]: First of all, most panels are mannels because there'll be only men.

03:53:12.840 --> 03:53:17.120
[Guest]: And when there is one lone woman, she'll definitely get the least airtime on the panel, irrespective

03:53:17.120 --> 03:53:21.120
[Guest]: of how senior or how much of an expert she is in that subject matter.

03:53:21.120 --> 03:53:25.280
[Guest]: The least airtime on the panel will go to the woman because everyone is always talking

03:53:25.280 --> 03:53:27.680
[Guest]: over her and interrupting her.

03:53:27.680 --> 03:53:33.720
[Amit Varma]: Tell me also about physical spaces, because to me, one of the best metaphors for how we

03:53:33.720 --> 03:53:36.960
[Amit Varma]: live in a world designed by men for men is air conditioning.

03:53:36.960 --> 03:53:38.520
[Amit Varma]: And you've also written a post about it.

03:53:38.520 --> 03:53:41.760
[Amit Varma]: I'd written about it three or four years ago, I think when Me Too happened.

03:53:41.760 --> 03:53:46.720
[Amit Varma]: You know how air conditioning was designed in the 1950s and 60s, when all offices were

03:53:46.720 --> 03:53:48.720
[Amit Varma]: occupied mostly by men.

03:53:48.720 --> 03:53:52.800
[Amit Varma]: And so it kept the male body temperature into account and that too, assuming that men are

03:53:52.800 --> 03:53:55.480
[Amit Varma]: wearing suits or 21 degrees was like the default.

03:53:55.480 --> 03:53:58.600
[Amit Varma]: Now, the truth is that it's too cold for women.

03:53:58.600 --> 03:54:01.280
[Amit Varma]: Women feel cold at 21.

03:54:01.280 --> 03:54:03.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, they need something warmer.

03:54:03.320 --> 03:54:09.200
[Amit Varma]: And yet the default is that, you know, every office today will be too cold for women because

03:54:09.200 --> 03:54:12.160
[Amit Varma]: it's set at that, quote unquote, male temperature.

03:54:12.160 --> 03:54:15.760
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, one thing that you point out is very common for women to have is that they'll

03:54:15.760 --> 03:54:21.760
[Amit Varma]: have something called an office sweater, office sweater, office shawl, because they know that

03:54:21.760 --> 03:54:22.760
[Amit Varma]: there's no way out.

03:54:22.760 --> 03:54:24.960
[Amit Varma]: They've got to kind of deal with that.

03:54:24.960 --> 03:54:31.160
[Amit Varma]: And you've also pointed out that this is also true when it comes to having women's toilets

03:54:31.160 --> 03:54:36.280
[Amit Varma]: and not just to say in Bihar, where you know, where you point out this particular place

03:54:36.280 --> 03:54:38.760
[Amit Varma]: where there were seven women in an office of 300.

03:54:38.760 --> 03:54:42.940
[Amit Varma]: But even in Kerala, where there were 100 women out of a staff of 300.

03:54:42.940 --> 03:54:48.840
[Amit Varma]: And even there, there's one lady's toilet as compared to eight or 10 ladies toilets.

03:54:48.840 --> 03:54:53.560
[Amit Varma]: And you've also pointed out this another example, which another of the people who spoke to you

03:54:53.560 --> 03:54:58.200
[Amit Varma]: gave that she was in this place where, you know, there were enough women, but there were

03:54:58.200 --> 03:54:59.640
[Amit Varma]: only two toilets on the floor.

03:54:59.640 --> 03:55:02.440
[Amit Varma]: It was an office in a five star hotel and they were both gents toilets.

03:55:02.440 --> 03:55:07.200
[Amit Varma]: So she spoke to her boss and her boss said, okay, it's fair enough, ladies do it.

03:55:07.200 --> 03:55:10.760
[Amit Varma]: And one people spread a rumour that she was having an affair with the boss, because why

03:55:10.760 --> 03:55:12.540
[Amit Varma]: else would he agree to this?

03:55:12.540 --> 03:55:16.800
[Amit Varma]: And two, these guys would slink in after office hours, and they would pee all over the women's

03:55:16.800 --> 03:55:19.560
[Amit Varma]: toilet because they were just so angry.

03:55:19.560 --> 03:55:21.520
[Amit Varma]: And so these are really two separate questions.

03:55:21.520 --> 03:55:28.360
[Amit Varma]: And one is that just in terms of workplaces, do you see a growing awareness or are women

03:55:28.360 --> 03:55:32.480
[Amit Varma]: just saying that this is not a fight worth fighting, we'll just satisfy sweet, you know,

03:55:32.480 --> 03:55:38.040
[Amit Varma]: in your post on pregnancy, you wrote about, you know, to punish a woman for being pregnant,

03:55:38.040 --> 03:55:44.320
[Amit Varma]: she was actually put on a floor because they want to make life uncomfortable for her because

03:55:44.320 --> 03:55:45.320
[Amit Varma]: she leaves.

03:55:45.320 --> 03:55:53.160
[Amit Varma]: So, in workplaces, do you see the general attitude of the women being that we'll manage,

03:55:53.160 --> 03:55:57.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, and you carry that layer where whenever you enter a place, you're quickly eyeing out

03:55:57.400 --> 03:56:00.080
[Amit Varma]: where is the nearest toilet when you need it?

03:56:00.080 --> 03:56:04.800
[Amit Varma]: And that's one question, and the second one is, what is with this male anger?

03:56:04.800 --> 03:56:09.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, that story, I found it so disturbing, that people are going after office hours,

03:56:09.160 --> 03:56:13.000
[Amit Varma]: and they're peeing all over the women's toilet because they're upset that women have a toilet.

03:56:13.000 --> 03:56:14.000
[Guest]: I know, right?

03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:16.400
[Guest]: It's like monkeys flinging feces at each other.

03:56:16.400 --> 03:56:17.840
[Amit Varma]: Kindly tell me about this.

03:56:17.840 --> 03:56:18.840
[Guest]: What is this monkeys?

03:56:18.840 --> 03:56:23.400
[Guest]: Monkeys, when they're angry, they shoot in their hands and flee and they'll fling feces

03:56:23.400 --> 03:56:24.400
[Guest]: at each other.

03:56:24.400 --> 03:56:25.400
[Amit Varma]: And they're angry.

03:56:25.400 --> 03:56:26.400
[Amit Varma]: Why do you think that is?

03:56:26.400 --> 03:56:30.160
[Guest]: That is a primal instinct, which these men are also following.

03:56:30.160 --> 03:56:34.080
[Unknown]: Let's pee all over the toilet that we don't like.

03:56:34.080 --> 03:56:35.080
[Unknown]: Hmm.

03:56:35.080 --> 03:56:36.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:56:36.080 --> 03:56:39.240
[Amit Varma]: A, how do women cope and B, why are men so angry?

03:56:39.240 --> 03:56:42.840
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, which is why I thought when I asked you that question earlier about the

03:56:42.840 --> 03:56:46.920
[Amit Varma]: reactions to womaning, I thought men will have two kinds, one will be angry, as you're

03:56:46.920 --> 03:56:51.640
[Amit Varma]: pointing out that angry kind probably doesn't read or perhaps even can't read, you know,

03:56:51.640 --> 03:56:53.360
[Amit Varma]: but in general, there is this anger.

03:56:53.360 --> 03:56:55.200
[Guest]: So yeah, 100%.

03:56:55.200 --> 03:56:58.120
[Guest]: So first part is about women.

03:56:58.120 --> 03:56:59.120
[Guest]: How do they cope?

03:56:59.120 --> 03:57:01.040
[Guest]: I think most women suffer in silence.

03:57:01.040 --> 03:57:03.840
[Guest]: That is the majority reaction.

03:57:03.840 --> 03:57:09.360
[Guest]: Very few women are like me who will make a nuisance of themselves and the lady in my

03:57:09.360 --> 03:57:14.640
[Guest]: story who went and told, at least had the guts to go and talk to the boss about it.

03:57:14.640 --> 03:57:19.400
[Guest]: So first of all, most senior professionals are male, glass ceiling.

03:57:19.400 --> 03:57:24.200
[Guest]: So upar se koi soch hi nahi raha hain issues ki baare mein because they are men.

03:57:24.200 --> 03:57:28.880
[Guest]: They are incapable of thinking about these things because who has the time to apna profit

03:57:28.880 --> 03:57:32.760
[Guest]: loss yeh sab cheeze sochna hai, market share sochna hai, sab ke beech mein who's going

03:57:32.760 --> 03:57:38.120
[Guest]: to sit and think about do my employees have enough women toilets and what are the facilities

03:57:38.120 --> 03:57:39.120
[Guest]: in these toilets.

03:57:39.120 --> 03:57:41.480
[Guest]: No one has time to think about it.

03:57:41.480 --> 03:57:46.680
[Guest]: So mostly the bosses are men and so they don't have even, it's a complete blind spot for

03:57:46.680 --> 03:57:47.680
[Guest]: them.

03:57:47.680 --> 03:57:51.960
[Guest]: And most women who are working at these lower level positions don't have the voice or the

03:57:51.960 --> 03:57:54.920
[Guest]: agency or the courage to talk about it, you know.

03:57:54.920 --> 03:57:59.680
[Guest]: The word toilet is not something that women will use very freely around men anyway because

03:57:59.680 --> 03:58:02.640
[Guest]: of all the cultural filters that we have.

03:58:02.640 --> 03:58:06.120
[Guest]: Like I am the only person here probably who's talking this much about toilet.

03:58:06.120 --> 03:58:09.000
[Guest]: You used the word tatti on my show which I think is a first.

03:58:09.000 --> 03:58:10.000
[Guest]: Thank you for that.

03:58:10.000 --> 03:58:11.000
[Guest]: It's a first, right?

03:58:11.000 --> 03:58:12.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:58:12.000 --> 03:58:13.000
[Guest]: So that's what.

03:58:13.000 --> 03:58:16.240
[Guest]: So I mean, this is very shocking for most people.

03:58:16.240 --> 03:58:19.480
[Guest]: So cultured society mein yeh baatein nahi hoti hain and therefore cultured society

03:58:19.480 --> 03:58:24.600
[Guest]: mein women are not able to voice these demands or expectations.

03:58:24.600 --> 03:58:30.640
[Guest]: And women are also in our own way conditioned to accept this as the lot of life, not question

03:58:30.640 --> 03:58:31.640
[Guest]: it.

03:58:31.640 --> 03:58:36.000
[Guest]: Hai to hai, jaana hai, upar to jaana hai toilet ke liye, door jaana hai to jaana hai, poori

03:58:36.000 --> 03:58:40.800
[Guest]: building mein 100 aartein par toilets 1 is to 10 ka ratio hai to, theek hai, karenge

03:58:40.800 --> 03:58:43.120
[Guest]: sab ussi mein adjust, line laga ke.

03:58:43.120 --> 03:58:47.720
[Guest]: This is how women, I think for the vast majority of women cope like this because often they

03:58:47.720 --> 03:58:52.240
[Guest]: are working at a junior level compared to men and culturally they have been trained

03:58:52.240 --> 03:58:53.240
[Guest]: to be quiet.

03:58:53.240 --> 03:58:55.520
[Guest]: So most women suffer in silence.

03:58:55.520 --> 03:58:57.160
[Guest]: Why is there anger in men?

03:58:57.160 --> 03:59:00.840
[Guest]: I think womaning would also make more men angry if it had a tangible impact on their

03:59:00.840 --> 03:59:02.400
[Guest]: life, right?

03:59:02.400 --> 03:59:08.440
[Guest]: So I don't think a newsletter passively sitting on the internet is really making any tangible

03:59:08.440 --> 03:59:12.600
[Guest]: difference to their life, but if it did, then they would be angry too.

03:59:12.600 --> 03:59:19.400
[Guest]: I know a friend of mine who's been an active supporter and she's, many of these stories,

03:59:19.400 --> 03:59:22.160
[Guest]: like all the names are changed by the way, the names you are taking are not the real

03:59:22.160 --> 03:59:23.640
[Guest]: names of the women.

03:59:23.640 --> 03:59:27.000
[Guest]: So you've already spoken one or two of her stories.

03:59:27.000 --> 03:59:33.240
[Guest]: So she has been an active supporter and she reads it regularly and she shows it to her

03:59:33.240 --> 03:59:36.840
[Guest]: husband also sometimes that yeh meri kahaani hai kabhi kabhi when it's a professional

03:59:36.840 --> 03:59:38.960
[Guest]: story, personal nahi batati hai.

03:59:38.960 --> 03:59:43.520
[Guest]: But so recently she was telling me that she was having a fight with her husband about

03:59:43.520 --> 03:59:48.080
[Guest]: some gender roles in the house that she was constantly caregiving for both children and

03:59:48.080 --> 03:59:53.840
[Guest]: she had a trip opportunity coming up and for foreign something travel and he said, no,

03:59:53.840 --> 03:59:54.840
[Guest]: you're not going.

03:59:54.840 --> 03:59:56.760
[Guest]: Who's going to take care of the kids and all?

03:59:56.760 --> 03:59:59.800
[Guest]: And they had like a serious fight about it.

03:59:59.800 --> 04:00:04.160
[Guest]: And at one point he said ki yeh sab tum yeh womaning pad ke seekh rahi ho na.

04:00:04.160 --> 04:00:10.520
[Guest]: So for me it was a matter of great pride that it is, a man is seeing this as something that

04:00:10.520 --> 04:00:16.480
[Guest]: empowered a woman enough to question the inhuman conditions he is enforcing on his wife.

04:00:16.480 --> 04:00:20.800
[Guest]: But also that is the only place where it had, as soon as it started having a real impact

04:00:20.800 --> 04:00:25.260
[Guest]: on his real life, that's when he got upset with it and violently upset with it.

04:00:25.260 --> 04:00:30.640
[Guest]: Anything that actually will take away some of your male privilege will hurt you.

04:00:30.640 --> 04:00:34.920
[Guest]: That is a point where, and again, people seeing this as a zero-sum game, right, like here

04:00:34.920 --> 04:00:35.920
[Guest]: it is a zero-sum game.

04:00:35.920 --> 04:00:36.920
[Guest]: There are only two toilets.

04:00:36.920 --> 04:00:41.560
[Guest]: Toh agar ek toilet ladies ban gaya, toh mera ek toilet kam ho gaya as a man.

04:00:41.560 --> 04:00:45.800
[Guest]: Toh I am angry, ke unko kyun de diye aur toh ko utha ke mera toilet.

04:00:45.800 --> 04:00:52.520
[Guest]: Toh therefore, not seeing it as a larger thing where women have been suffering for so many

04:00:52.520 --> 04:00:57.240
[Guest]: years, I am the one who was occupying their rightful toilet and now it's only going back

04:00:57.240 --> 04:00:59.960
[Guest]: to the person who it truly belonged to.

04:00:59.960 --> 04:01:00.960
[Guest]: That's not how they'll see it.

04:01:00.960 --> 04:01:04.880
[Guest]: They'll see it as, I've for the last five years been peeing in this toilet, suddenly

04:01:04.880 --> 04:01:07.120
[Guest]: who are you to tell me I can't anymore?

04:01:07.120 --> 04:01:10.320
[Guest]: So let me fling some feces at you.

04:01:10.320 --> 04:01:15.720
[Amit Varma]: I love that line, unko kyun de diya mera toilet utha ke, which is quote of the episode.

04:01:15.720 --> 04:01:21.960
[Amit Varma]: What you also kind of point out is how, and this is again something men will kind of miss

04:01:21.960 --> 04:01:28.160
[Amit Varma]: or just take for granted, how there's a boys club in every office and it stops women from

04:01:28.160 --> 04:01:33.200
[Amit Varma]: kind of getting ahead, like there was a 2020 Harvard study you've cited, which says, quote,

04:01:33.200 --> 04:01:38.320
[Amit Varma]: over a four year period, male employees assigned a male manager were promoted faster than their

04:01:38.320 --> 04:01:42.360
[Amit Varma]: female counterparts with no observable difference in performance.

04:01:42.360 --> 04:01:45.840
[Amit Varma]: Women in turn were promoted at the same rate, whether assigned to a male manager or female

04:01:45.840 --> 04:01:50.120
[Amit Varma]: manager, male employees benefited from the higher rates of social interactions with their

04:01:50.120 --> 04:01:51.640
[Amit Varma]: male managers, stop quote.

04:01:51.640 --> 04:01:55.800
[Amit Varma]: And this might mean, you know, after work, you're going out for a drink with your male

04:01:55.800 --> 04:01:59.040
[Amit Varma]: colleagues, which women sometimes can't do, because hey, they got to get back home, there's

04:01:59.040 --> 04:02:03.240
[Amit Varma]: food to cook, all that other stuff is happening, or they may not even want to, you know, it

04:02:03.240 --> 04:02:08.920
[Amit Varma]: can just manifest in working late in office, where the woman will be like, the men will

04:02:08.920 --> 04:02:10.760
[Amit Varma]: stay till nine, 10 o'clock.

04:02:10.760 --> 04:02:14.280
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I think one of the people you spoke to commented on the actually the same

04:02:14.280 --> 04:02:16.760
[Amit Varma]: amount of work is getting done, men are just stretching it out.

04:02:16.760 --> 04:02:18.120
[Amit Varma]: It's like Parkinson's law, right?

04:02:18.120 --> 04:02:20.560
[Amit Varma]: Work expands to fill the time available, you know.

04:02:20.560 --> 04:02:25.840
[Amit Varma]: So I remember in my old office, there used to be a pool table, so we used to work late,

04:02:25.840 --> 04:02:30.160
[Amit Varma]: we used to play pool all night, but it's like, you know, and that obviously leads to a bonding

04:02:30.160 --> 04:02:33.840
[Amit Varma]: among all the people who are there and all that shit is happening.

04:02:33.840 --> 04:02:35.560
[Amit Varma]: So how does one look at this?

04:02:35.560 --> 04:02:41.480
[Amit Varma]: Because then what happens here, in a sense, is that all the men have the potential to

04:02:41.480 --> 04:02:46.400
[Amit Varma]: form this closely knit community of people who are doing all of these things together.

04:02:46.400 --> 04:02:51.420
[Amit Varma]: And all the women individually are kind of outside of this, right?

04:02:51.420 --> 04:02:54.520
[Amit Varma]: How does that pervert workplaces?

04:02:54.520 --> 04:02:57.360
[Amit Varma]: And how are there ways out of it?

04:02:57.360 --> 04:03:01.840
[Amit Varma]: Because these are all individual choices, you know, I can well, you know, if you ask

04:03:01.840 --> 04:03:05.480
[Amit Varma]: a guy, he'll say that, listen, I'll go out drinking with whoever I choose, right?

04:03:05.480 --> 04:03:06.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, what can I do?

04:03:06.480 --> 04:03:08.160
[Amit Varma]: No one is stopping her from coming.

04:03:08.160 --> 04:03:10.520
[Amit Varma]: So these are all individual choices.

04:03:10.520 --> 04:03:14.080
[Amit Varma]: And yet collectively, there's a massive problem for everybody.

04:03:14.080 --> 04:03:17.200
[Amit Varma]: So you know, what are what are sort of your thoughts?

04:03:17.200 --> 04:03:24.400
[Guest]: Yeah, so you've summarized the problem perfectly that it is a close knit boys club, and men,

04:03:24.400 --> 04:03:29.400
[Guest]: given that incentives are aligned to it, that by staying late at office or going out for

04:03:29.400 --> 04:03:35.760
[Guest]: drinks after work, I am getting that exclusive access to my boss and I am able to be party

04:03:35.760 --> 04:03:41.440
[Guest]: to big decisions being taken, where after hours when women have all gone home.

04:03:41.440 --> 04:03:43.280
[Guest]: So why shouldn't I capitalize on that?

04:03:43.280 --> 04:03:47.480
[Guest]: So I again, this is, you know, we talked about how earlier, you have a problem with government

04:03:47.480 --> 04:03:49.760
[Guest]: system, but not the people in that system.

04:03:49.760 --> 04:03:53.960
[Guest]: So same here, I have a problem with the system, not the men and women in it.

04:03:53.960 --> 04:03:57.160
[Guest]: Because like you said, these are individual choices that they are making based on their

04:03:57.160 --> 04:03:58.720
[Guest]: life conditions.

04:03:58.720 --> 04:04:02.120
[Guest]: And we can't say that toilets will be made when the caste system ends.

04:04:02.120 --> 04:04:08.400
[Guest]: So we can't say that first end gender discrimination, then we'll do something about the boys club.

04:04:08.400 --> 04:04:13.240
[Guest]: So we can't say that let the women first become equal partners to their husband and let their

04:04:13.240 --> 04:04:14.760
[Guest]: husbands take care of their children.

04:04:14.760 --> 04:04:18.720
[Guest]: So the woman can come here and have a drink with us as colleagues.

04:04:18.720 --> 04:04:20.520
[Guest]: That's not going to happen anytime soon.

04:04:20.520 --> 04:04:24.520
[Guest]: So I think the simpler solution, and that's why I started with workplaces because it has

04:04:24.520 --> 04:04:30.720
[Guest]: a little more simpler solutions, simpler problems to solve, this is on the boss basically.

04:04:30.720 --> 04:04:39.720
[Guest]: If you are taking important decisions about strategies and professional decisions are

04:04:39.720 --> 04:04:45.880
[Guest]: being made outside the office hours or the office space on a sutta break or over drinks

04:04:45.880 --> 04:04:47.880
[Guest]: later or over the pool table.

04:04:47.880 --> 04:04:51.720
[Guest]: If professional decisions are being taken in these settings, then that is a toxic workplace

04:04:51.720 --> 04:04:53.400
[Guest]: for a woman to be in.

04:04:53.400 --> 04:04:58.080
[Guest]: Because you are telling, you're creating a system where an employee has no choice but

04:04:58.080 --> 04:04:59.920
[Guest]: to stay after hours.

04:04:59.920 --> 04:05:01.400
[Guest]: And that could even be a man.

04:05:01.400 --> 04:05:05.800
[Guest]: It could be a man who says, I do want to go back home to my kids or even to watch TV after

04:05:05.800 --> 04:05:09.620
[Guest]: hours and I don't want to sit here up beyond 6pm or beyond working hours.

04:05:09.620 --> 04:05:15.160
[Guest]: So you have created an incentive system where people are forced to make these choices.

04:05:15.160 --> 04:05:20.920
[Guest]: So men and women, they're all reacting to the best of their own respective limitations

04:05:20.920 --> 04:05:22.600
[Guest]: and circumstances.

04:05:22.600 --> 04:05:28.600
[Guest]: But the simple solution to this is that bosses need to reflect on this and see that are we

04:05:28.600 --> 04:05:36.800
[Guest]: really giving an undue advantage to a colleague who's able to go to stay longer or hang out

04:05:36.800 --> 04:05:37.800
[Guest]: after hours.

04:05:37.800 --> 04:05:42.400
[Guest]: There is up to a certain limit, it is team building beyond which it is a boys club.

04:05:42.400 --> 04:05:49.200
[Guest]: So you know, things like meet on a meeting after hours ki jaga, why not meet on a, dedicate

04:05:49.200 --> 04:05:54.720
[Guest]: an afternoon and invite families, let people bring their kids and their spouses.

04:05:54.720 --> 04:05:58.600
[Guest]: It's a much more wholesome environment where women can also participate and you can do

04:05:58.600 --> 04:06:02.620
[Guest]: team building in a more healthier environment, more equitable environment.

04:06:02.620 --> 04:06:07.320
[Guest]: So there are small steps like this, many of which I've mentioned in the post also.

04:06:07.320 --> 04:06:13.240
[Guest]: But it's right now, at least at the workplace, these biases are relatively easier sorted

04:06:13.240 --> 04:06:19.880
[Guest]: out, but it needs that amount of reflection from the CEOs, organizations, bosses.

04:06:19.880 --> 04:06:24.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and the key point is that it's actually in the self interest of the bosses and the

04:06:24.280 --> 04:06:26.200
[Amit Varma]: CEOs to take this into account.

04:06:26.200 --> 04:06:30.960
[Amit Varma]: Like, I keep referring to this study, which I discovered through Philip Tetlock's book

04:06:30.960 --> 04:06:36.240
[Amit Varma]: Super Forecasting, where he points out that when a group is making a decision, the most

04:06:36.240 --> 04:06:42.600
[Amit Varma]: important factor in the quality of the decision is not the education or the intelligence of

04:06:42.600 --> 04:06:45.000
[Amit Varma]: the people involved, it is a diversity.

04:06:45.000 --> 04:06:49.400
[Amit Varma]: The more diverse a group you get, you will get better decisions, which when you think

04:06:49.400 --> 04:06:52.800
[Amit Varma]: about it is so obvious that it even seems banal, that obviously, you have different

04:06:52.800 --> 04:06:55.880
[Amit Varma]: viewpoints colliding, you're more likely to reach a good decision.

04:06:55.880 --> 04:07:01.440
[Amit Varma]: So it is therefore, in the interest of bosses to build diverse workplaces.

04:07:01.440 --> 04:07:06.160
[Amit Varma]: And I think there was a study in the US a while back a few years ago, which also showed

04:07:06.160 --> 04:07:09.680
[Amit Varma]: that companies which discriminate do worse in the market.

04:07:09.680 --> 04:07:14.240
[Amit Varma]: So purely from a position of self interest, you want a diverse workplace.

04:07:14.240 --> 04:07:20.560
[Amit Varma]: And in this particular context, that means involving the women as deeply in decision

04:07:20.560 --> 04:07:22.800
[Amit Varma]: making as the men are involved.

04:07:22.800 --> 04:07:25.720
[Amit Varma]: And a boys club really gets in the way of that, because then you're kind of shutting

04:07:25.720 --> 04:07:27.200
[Amit Varma]: the women out.

04:07:27.200 --> 04:07:33.440
[Amit Varma]: But you know, how you get to those solutions becomes something, you know, it's complicated,

04:07:33.440 --> 04:07:34.720
[Amit Varma]: as you've pointed out.

04:07:34.720 --> 04:07:38.960
[Amit Varma]: Another point that you mentioned in the context of offices is the different ways in which

04:07:38.960 --> 04:07:41.440
[Amit Varma]: we treat maternity and paternity.

04:07:41.440 --> 04:07:46.080
[Amit Varma]: Maternitically, it's understood that even if it's fought, but it's understood that women

04:07:46.080 --> 04:07:49.160
[Amit Varma]: need to go, they need to spend time with the kids and all of that.

04:07:49.160 --> 04:07:54.960
[Amit Varma]: But paternity leave, even when it is there on the rolls, you know, men are frowned upon,

04:07:54.960 --> 04:07:56.640
[Amit Varma]: if they actually take it.

04:07:56.640 --> 04:08:01.240
[Amit Varma]: I think you quoted someone who mentioned that people in his office when he took paternity

04:08:01.240 --> 04:08:06.080
[Amit Varma]: leave, they told him, quote, you will understand at the time of appraisal that you shouldn't

04:08:06.080 --> 04:08:07.080
[Amit Varma]: have taken it.

04:08:07.080 --> 04:08:08.080
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

04:08:08.080 --> 04:08:12.280
[Amit Varma]: The expectation being, okay, there's a baby on Sunday, but you come to the office on Wednesday,

04:08:12.280 --> 04:08:16.200
[Amit Varma]: people will congratulate you, and then you go to the meeting, because there's someone

04:08:16.200 --> 04:08:18.200
[Guest]: at home who's taking care of it.

04:08:18.200 --> 04:08:19.200
[Guest]: Right.

04:08:19.200 --> 04:08:20.200
[Amit Varma]: I'm sorry.

04:08:20.200 --> 04:08:21.200
[Amit Varma]: My, this is not.

04:08:21.200 --> 04:08:22.200
[Amit Varma]: It's a Bengali thing.

04:08:22.200 --> 04:08:23.200
[Guest]: It's a Bengali thing.

04:08:23.200 --> 04:08:24.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:08:24.200 --> 04:08:27.200
[Amit Varma]: I blame my half Bengali thing for this.

04:08:27.200 --> 04:08:33.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, tell me a little bit about this, because, you know, there are many men who now take

04:08:33.520 --> 04:08:40.480
[Amit Varma]: fatherhood seriously, hopefully, and who, who want to participate, you know, like one

04:08:40.480 --> 04:08:44.040
[Amit Varma]: of the men you interviewed, who said, I wanted to be with my child, that is reason enough,

04:08:44.040 --> 04:08:49.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, but, you know, how are attitudes towards this evolving?

04:08:49.640 --> 04:08:53.600
[Amit Varma]: And if it does hurt careers, if your bosses are going to feel that, hey, this guy is not

04:08:53.600 --> 04:08:57.280
[Amit Varma]: committed enough, you know, why is he going back home wife to her?

04:08:57.280 --> 04:09:05.280
[Amit Varma]: So does it then create a disincentive towards that kind of caring parenthood, if your office

04:09:05.280 --> 04:09:07.480
[Amit Varma]: environment is kind of like this?

04:09:07.480 --> 04:09:11.480
[Amit Varma]: And does one see, does one see a drift towards change?

04:09:11.480 --> 04:09:14.460
[Amit Varma]: And this is perhaps a separate question, so you can take it after this.

04:09:14.460 --> 04:09:19.480
[Amit Varma]: But in the office context, does one see a drift towards change?

04:09:19.480 --> 04:09:25.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, in a longer term thing, even if it's slow, you know, is a change happening?

04:09:25.360 --> 04:09:26.360
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:09:26.360 --> 04:09:31.000
[Guest]: So, before I talk about the professional side of what men face at the workplace, I want

04:09:31.000 --> 04:09:34.800
[Guest]: to also underscore the importance of paternity leave on the personal front.

04:09:34.800 --> 04:09:40.880
[Guest]: So, yes, India is has a very progressive maternity leave policy, six months compulsory leave,

04:09:40.880 --> 04:09:44.400
[Guest]: which is by global standards, one of the best.

04:09:44.400 --> 04:09:48.760
[Guest]: So we've done well on that front, at least we are giving women the time to recuperate

04:09:48.760 --> 04:09:51.080
[Guest]: after childbirth and get into...

04:09:51.080 --> 04:09:55.120
[Amit Varma]: I'll actually interject and point out that as Pragati Editor, I'd commissioned a bunch

04:09:55.120 --> 04:09:59.520
[Amit Varma]: of pieces on this, Devika Kher, Suman Joshi, a bunch of different people had written pieces

04:09:59.520 --> 04:10:04.400
[Amit Varma]: and the maternity law that we have in India has actually hurt women more than helped them

04:10:04.400 --> 04:10:08.800
[Amit Varma]: as a lot of well intentioned laws do, in the sense that women's employment has certainly

04:10:08.800 --> 04:10:10.040
[Amit Varma]: gone down because of it.

04:10:10.040 --> 04:10:15.320
[Amit Varma]: And this is something we predicted before it happened, because you're changing the incentives.

04:10:15.320 --> 04:10:19.080
[Amit Varma]: So the intentions were great, the outcomes have been bad, and I still feel that while

04:10:19.080 --> 04:10:24.840
[Amit Varma]: it's a problem you absolutely have to address, a law is such a blunt weapon and can backfire

04:10:24.840 --> 04:10:29.280
[Amit Varma]: so spectacularly, as seems to have happened in this case, but I'm sorry, carry on.

04:10:29.280 --> 04:10:30.280
[Guest]: Yeah, no.

04:10:30.280 --> 04:10:34.400
[Guest]: So the solution I want to propose also addresses that problem.

04:10:34.400 --> 04:10:37.320
[Guest]: And I agree with you that the law has been very blunt.

04:10:37.320 --> 04:10:43.480
[Guest]: But also, I mean, if we think of it as a baby steps evolution, so first thing, at least

04:10:43.480 --> 04:10:49.120
[Guest]: give women time to recuperate and at least six months of breastfeeding for the infant

04:10:49.120 --> 04:10:51.120
[Guest]: is good and so on and so forth.

04:10:51.120 --> 04:10:57.040
[Guest]: So for all these reasons, good, you gave women time to sit at home and bond with the babies.

04:10:57.040 --> 04:11:04.080
[Guest]: But I also think that that is exactly where lies the genesis of gender roles in a marriage

04:11:04.080 --> 04:11:06.360
[Guest]: and therefore later in a household.

04:11:06.360 --> 04:11:10.720
[Guest]: And honestly, if you had to tell me that Mahima, you can change one thing in the world, I would

04:11:10.720 --> 04:11:12.800
[Guest]: say change this.

04:11:12.800 --> 04:11:16.480
[Guest]: Give all men equal and compulsory paternity leave.

04:11:16.480 --> 04:11:22.960
[Guest]: So first of all, compulsory makes it not no longer voluntary, like right now, there is

04:11:22.960 --> 04:11:28.400
[Guest]: it is suggested, itna le lo, thoda sa, zyada kam, and then the boss will give dhamki of

04:11:28.400 --> 04:11:33.080
[Guest]: appraisal and then make you come to office anyway, or sometimes the man anyway doesn't

04:11:33.080 --> 04:11:34.080
[Guest]: want to go.

04:11:34.080 --> 04:11:37.480
[Guest]: So he will use the boss as an excuse.

04:11:37.480 --> 04:11:41.880
[Guest]: The reason why I think one thing I would change in the world is compulsory paternity leave.

04:11:41.880 --> 04:11:48.440
[Guest]: My bigger reason is personal, not professional, which is that I feel that up to a marriage

04:11:48.440 --> 04:11:56.200
[Guest]: without children, it is relatively still possible to maintain an equal marriage in the relatively

04:11:56.200 --> 04:12:01.640
[Guest]: equal relationship where both partners have their own personal space, professional space,

04:12:01.640 --> 04:12:08.400
[Guest]: have their own identities, their own and then pursuing their things in life, growing together,

04:12:08.400 --> 04:12:10.200
[Guest]: love, blah, blah.

04:12:10.200 --> 04:12:18.540
[Guest]: The critical point beyond which gender roles take over, and in my opinion, 99.99% of marriages

04:12:18.540 --> 04:12:21.080
[Guest]: in India are unequal.

04:12:21.080 --> 04:12:26.440
[Guest]: And I'm just leaving 0.01% so that people don't get angry at me because not all marriages

04:12:26.440 --> 04:12:29.960
[Guest]: hashtag not all marriages.

04:12:29.960 --> 04:12:35.000
[Guest]: But otherwise, I have never met any couple which has an equal marriage, including my

04:12:35.000 --> 04:12:36.000
[Guest]: own.

04:12:36.000 --> 04:12:41.600
[Guest]: So when that happens, the critical point is when you have your first baby, because after

04:12:41.600 --> 04:12:46.240
[Guest]: having a baby is a transformative experience for the primary caregiver.

04:12:46.240 --> 04:12:48.800
[Guest]: I'm not saying mother, I'm saying primary caregiver.

04:12:48.800 --> 04:12:54.720
[Guest]: Whoever is bonding with a baby in their infancy, their brain goes through biological chemical

04:12:54.720 --> 04:12:55.720
[Guest]: changes.

04:12:55.720 --> 04:13:02.080
[Guest]: They become much more aware of all the, you know, primal risks to the baby's safety.

04:13:02.080 --> 04:13:07.680
[Guest]: We're all animalistic programming, which is that when you're caring for an infant, you're

04:13:07.680 --> 04:13:12.240
[Guest]: always on the lookout for what all can hurt them, which is how in my house, you will find

04:13:12.240 --> 04:13:16.880
[Guest]: no sharp edges anywhere, like fully baby proofed and I walk into a room and now my brain automatically

04:13:16.880 --> 04:13:20.320
[Guest]: goes to all the sharp edges where a child can get hurt, even if there's no child in

04:13:20.320 --> 04:13:21.320
[Guest]: the room.

04:13:21.320 --> 04:13:26.260
[Guest]: So that's the kind of reprogramming that your brain goes through in those early months.

04:13:26.260 --> 04:13:28.560
[Guest]: And there's a bonding with a child.

04:13:28.560 --> 04:13:33.240
[Guest]: And then there's an awareness of all the mental load that goes with the child, which is, diaper

04:13:33.240 --> 04:13:37.480
[Guest]: khatam hone wale hain, bachcha bada ho gaya hain, itna hi kapde kharidne hain.

04:13:37.480 --> 04:13:40.420
[Guest]: There's all of these small, small things which add up.

04:13:40.420 --> 04:13:46.640
[Guest]: And over time, in the mother's mind, because mothers are the primary caregivers in 100%

04:13:46.640 --> 04:13:50.720
[Guest]: of Indian marriages, in the mother's mind, all of this reprogramming has happened.

04:13:50.720 --> 04:13:55.200
[Guest]: And the father is not around when this is happening, because there is no compulsory

04:13:55.200 --> 04:13:56.280
[Guest]: paternity leave.

04:13:56.280 --> 04:14:02.440
[Guest]: And if it is, it's, government gives 15 days, which is I think the best right now, because

04:14:02.440 --> 04:14:05.840
[Guest]: private sector mein toh I've heard of men who were doing emailing from the hospital

04:14:05.840 --> 04:14:06.840
[Guest]: also.

04:14:06.840 --> 04:14:10.160
[Guest]: So even Monday to, sunday ko baby aur wednesday ko office bhi nahi hain, it's literally on

04:14:10.160 --> 04:14:11.640
[Guest]: the day they are working.

04:14:11.640 --> 04:14:17.640
[Guest]: So it's much worse in private sector, but also there in every sector.

04:14:17.640 --> 04:14:23.200
[Guest]: So making it compulsory forces the man to be there, even if it is, I'm not saying that

04:14:23.200 --> 04:14:27.640
[Guest]: all men need to be forced to be around their kid, but many men will think of it as, yes,

04:14:27.640 --> 04:14:29.120
[Guest]: fatherhood is important to me.

04:14:29.120 --> 04:14:34.720
[Guest]: But also at the same time, their primary identity in their mind is that I am general manager

04:14:34.720 --> 04:14:39.800
[Guest]: so and so, I am senior associate so and so, I am vice president so and so.

04:14:39.800 --> 04:14:45.040
[Guest]: That is, to my mind, most men have their primary identity as that, whereas for me as a woman,

04:14:45.040 --> 04:14:49.440
[Guest]: I also had that primary identity until three years back and then my brain got reprogrammed

04:14:49.440 --> 04:14:52.240
[Guest]: and today my primary identity is that I'm a mother.

04:14:52.240 --> 04:14:55.380
[Guest]: If you ask me who are you, first thing I will think of is that.

04:14:55.380 --> 04:15:00.720
[Guest]: So that identity shift does not happen in men because they are not around in those initial

04:15:00.720 --> 04:15:02.360
[Guest]: crucial months.

04:15:02.360 --> 04:15:08.880
[Guest]: And I think if they were around for that period, then even the most hardened of men would actually

04:15:08.880 --> 04:15:14.760
[Guest]: come to see life from the perspective of a caregiver, which is how women see it.

04:15:14.760 --> 04:15:18.200
[Guest]: And it would equalize so much, it would solve so many problems.

04:15:18.200 --> 04:15:23.080
[Guest]: And coming to what you said about how policy has unintentionally disadvantaged women, if

04:15:23.080 --> 04:15:27.400
[Guest]: you made it compulsory for men also, then that disadvantage and mismatch goes, right.

04:15:27.400 --> 04:15:31.720
[Guest]: Now the company has no added advantage in hiring a man over a woman because chhe maina

04:15:31.720 --> 04:15:35.000
[Guest]: dono ko hi dena padega, agar pacha hua toh.

04:15:35.000 --> 04:15:41.560
[Guest]: There is another aspect that once I wrote this post, HR head of one of the biggest startups

04:15:41.560 --> 04:15:45.760
[Guest]: in India actually discovered it after I wrote this because he had written a book about it

04:15:45.760 --> 04:15:50.200
[Guest]: and then he wrote to me and we did a call and he said that I want to talk to you about

04:15:50.200 --> 04:15:51.320
[Guest]: this and drill down.

04:15:51.320 --> 04:15:57.520
[Guest]: And his thing was that Indian government has forced it on companies and it is unviable

04:15:57.520 --> 04:16:02.040
[Guest]: for many companies to give you full salary for six months.

04:16:02.040 --> 04:16:07.200
[Guest]: And in many other countries, the government subsidizes it or you have between a couple,

04:16:07.200 --> 04:16:11.000
[Guest]: you have one year of leave, toh chahe chhe maina tum chhe maina main, chahe aage peeche,

04:16:11.000 --> 04:16:16.120
[Guest]: chahe teen nao, we can divide it, but the government will subsidize our firms for taking

04:16:16.120 --> 04:16:17.120
[Guest]: it.

04:16:17.120 --> 04:16:21.560
[Guest]: So, there are many models of making it more doable and practical and viable.

04:16:21.560 --> 04:16:25.920
[Guest]: But at the end of the day, I feel very strongly that compulsory and equal paternity leave

04:16:25.920 --> 04:16:29.720
[Guest]: for men has to be the lever.

04:16:29.720 --> 04:16:34.840
[Amit Varma]: I feel very strongly about the social problem you are describing obviously, but I feel equally

04:16:34.840 --> 04:16:41.920
[Amit Varma]: strongly that the coercive hand of the state will not solve it, it will make it worse.

04:16:41.920 --> 04:16:45.840
[Amit Varma]: Like first of all, the reason the maternity law backfired so spectacularly is for many

04:16:45.840 --> 04:16:47.760
[Amit Varma]: firms is simply they're not viable.

04:16:47.760 --> 04:16:52.960
[Amit Varma]: If you're a five person firm, and you're hiring a sixth person, you know, it is not rational

04:16:52.960 --> 04:16:56.560
[Amit Varma]: to hire someone who could then just go off on a paid leave for six months, you can't

04:16:56.560 --> 04:16:59.440
[Amit Varma]: afford it, your company could go down if something like that happens.

04:16:59.440 --> 04:17:05.280
[Amit Varma]: Now it is unfortunate, but it is rational, and I think Tim Lee's had once forecast at

04:17:05.280 --> 04:17:10.480
[Amit Varma]: the time this law came out that it would lead to a loss of between eight to 11 lakh jobs

04:17:10.480 --> 04:17:11.480
[Amit Varma]: for women.

04:17:11.480 --> 04:17:17.000
[Amit Varma]: So forgive me if I get the figure wrong, but I'll link to those pieces by Devika and Suman

04:17:17.000 --> 04:17:18.160
[Amit Varma]: in the show notes.

04:17:18.160 --> 04:17:22.160
[Amit Varma]: And the problem that would then happen if you may be you're saying that make it make

04:17:22.160 --> 04:17:27.260
[Amit Varma]: a compulsory paternity leave for men as well, which would solve the problem.

04:17:27.260 --> 04:17:31.920
[Amit Varma]: It actually wouldn't, because then it would create a bias for hiring unmarried men, with

04:17:31.920 --> 04:17:33.960
[Amit Varma]: whom this danger wouldn't be there.

04:17:33.960 --> 04:17:39.040
[Amit Varma]: Like honestly, any, you know, there are a lot of social problems, which can only be

04:17:39.040 --> 04:17:44.600
[Amit Varma]: solved through voluntary means through social action, you bring the coercive hand of the

04:17:44.600 --> 04:17:49.960
[Amit Varma]: state in, it leads to all kinds of perverse outcomes, as has happened with the maternity

04:17:49.960 --> 04:17:52.060
[Amit Varma]: leave act, which has really harmed women.

04:17:52.060 --> 04:17:56.080
[Amit Varma]: You know, you might think intention is great, you're guaranteeing something that every woman

04:17:56.080 --> 04:17:59.960
[Amit Varma]: should be entitled to, but the point is, she's not getting that job in the first place, you

04:17:59.960 --> 04:18:00.960
[Amit Varma]: know.

04:18:00.960 --> 04:18:05.460
[Amit Varma]: So you have to look at outcome and not intentions, which in my view is, you know, the most common

04:18:05.460 --> 04:18:07.480
[Amit Varma]: mistake people make about public policy.

04:18:07.480 --> 04:18:09.680
[Guest]: No, fair point.

04:18:09.680 --> 04:18:14.560
[Guest]: Only one response is that why would there be a bias for single men, because single men

04:18:14.560 --> 04:18:17.960
[Amit Varma]: can also get married and have a baby just as a single woman can get married and have

04:18:17.960 --> 04:18:18.960
[Amit Varma]: a baby.

04:18:18.960 --> 04:18:19.960
[Amit Varma]: It's probabilistic thinking.

04:18:19.960 --> 04:18:23.680
[Amit Varma]: A single man is less likely to be a father, say within a short term period, if he's single.

04:18:23.680 --> 04:18:25.360
[Amit Varma]: First he has to get married, then he'll have kids.

04:18:25.360 --> 04:18:28.240
[Guest]: That's true of a single woman also.

04:18:28.240 --> 04:18:30.560
[Guest]: Single woman also first has to get married and then have kids.

04:18:30.560 --> 04:18:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I would imagine there would be more of a bias against a newly married woman than

04:18:34.040 --> 04:18:36.240
[Guest]: against a single woman.

04:18:36.240 --> 04:18:37.240
[Guest]: Which is true even today.

04:18:37.240 --> 04:18:40.720
[Amit Varma]: But I'm saying that between a single man and a single woman, there would be not much difference.

04:18:40.720 --> 04:18:43.480
[Guest]: Yeah, but I'm saying, why do you want to, and let me also tell you.

04:18:43.480 --> 04:18:46.600
[Guest]: Also, I agree with you that coercive hand of the state is not the answer.

04:18:46.600 --> 04:18:48.880
[Amit Varma]: I'll tell you what the answer would be in my view.

04:18:48.880 --> 04:18:53.600
[Amit Varma]: The answer would be is, what I would like to see, like I always believe that the best

04:18:53.600 --> 04:18:55.880
[Amit Varma]: regulation is competition.

04:18:55.880 --> 04:18:57.920
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't come from the coercive hand of the state.

04:18:57.920 --> 04:19:03.920
[Amit Varma]: So what I would love to see is companies competing, where companies can reach out and say, we

04:19:03.920 --> 04:19:04.920
[Amit Varma]: want the best talent.

04:19:04.920 --> 04:19:08.120
[Amit Varma]: If you're a woman, we'll give you six months maternity leave.

04:19:08.120 --> 04:19:10.080
[Amit Varma]: Let somebody else say, we'll give you eight months.

04:19:10.080 --> 04:19:14.920
[Amit Varma]: Let somebody say, paternity leave six months, we'll give you, let them compete on that front.

04:19:14.920 --> 04:19:20.400
[Amit Varma]: But before they compete on that front, what is important is that those things, six months

04:19:20.400 --> 04:19:26.320
[Amit Varma]: paternity leave, etc, etc, become attractive enough for society at large, for it to be

04:19:26.320 --> 04:19:28.840
[Amit Varma]: viable for companies to compete on that front.

04:19:28.840 --> 04:19:36.760
[Amit Varma]: And for that you need a change in social attitudes, which happens at a glacial pace, which society

04:19:36.760 --> 04:19:39.040
[Amit Varma]: might even go backwards sometimes.

04:19:39.040 --> 04:19:41.240
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, a coercive hand of the state won't get there.

04:19:41.240 --> 04:19:46.360
[Amit Varma]: So that is just my sort of a little, No, I don't know about that.

04:19:46.360 --> 04:19:50.880
[Guest]: Because I was about to say what you said about competition, because there are all these gender

04:19:50.880 --> 04:19:55.000
[Guest]: rankings these days, you know, I mean, and many companies will proudly put it on their

04:19:55.000 --> 04:19:59.880
[Guest]: website, Badasa banner ke, ranked number one in so and so gender ranking, great workplace

04:19:59.880 --> 04:20:00.880
[Guest]: for women.

04:20:00.880 --> 04:20:03.440
[Guest]: So that is already happening to some extent.

04:20:03.440 --> 04:20:07.440
[Guest]: But it is in all of these, you know, tier one, tier two polished companies, where white

04:20:07.440 --> 04:20:09.680
[Guest]: color office or AC andar.

04:20:09.680 --> 04:20:15.400
[Guest]: But what about the women who are working, say, in public sector bank or in a machine,

04:20:15.400 --> 04:20:16.400
[Amit Varma]: factory?

04:20:16.400 --> 04:20:17.400
[Amit Varma]: I agree with you.

04:20:17.400 --> 04:20:20.280
[Amit Varma]: But I'm saying that the coercive hand of the state is will make their lives worse.

04:20:20.280 --> 04:20:22.680
[Amit Varma]: It's not even a partial solution.

04:20:22.680 --> 04:20:26.000
[Amit Varma]: It is not a solution at all, it literally makes the problem worse.

04:20:26.000 --> 04:20:29.800
[Amit Varma]: And I don't just mean in this context, or maternity leave or whatever, in literally

04:20:29.800 --> 04:20:35.560
[Amit Varma]: anything where the state passes regulation with a good intention, you really need to

04:20:35.560 --> 04:20:36.560
[Amit Varma]: look at the outcomes.

04:20:36.560 --> 04:20:40.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, India's, for example, been hobbled so long by bad labor laws, which are meant

04:20:40.920 --> 04:20:44.960
[Amit Varma]: to protect labor, but have exactly the opposite impact.

04:20:44.960 --> 04:20:48.160
[Amit Varma]: And we've suffered so deeply for that, you know, and so on and so forth.

04:20:48.160 --> 04:20:49.600
[Amit Varma]: But that's a minor point.

04:20:49.600 --> 04:20:52.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I, you know, solutions are a different matter.

04:20:52.760 --> 04:20:56.120
[Amit Varma]: But I totally agree with you on the extent of the problem.

04:20:56.120 --> 04:21:02.040
[Amit Varma]: And if men were forced to look after their kids for the first six months, you know, one

04:21:02.040 --> 04:21:06.160
[Amit Varma]: would hope that at least some of the blindness and the unseen nature of what it involves

04:21:06.160 --> 04:21:07.160
[Amit Varma]: would go away.

04:21:07.160 --> 04:21:08.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:21:08.160 --> 04:21:12.080
[Guest]: So, I mean, there is no perfect answer right now on how it should be done.

04:21:12.080 --> 04:21:15.920
[Guest]: Because like you're saying, the self-voluntary thing will happen, like, it's like saying

04:21:15.920 --> 04:21:18.200
[Guest]: caste system jab jaayega tab toilet banayenge.

04:21:18.200 --> 04:21:21.960
[Guest]: So, it's also that, that difference is there.

04:21:21.960 --> 04:21:25.080
[Guest]: Like for me personally, I just became a mother three years back.

04:21:25.080 --> 04:21:30.360
[Guest]: And if this law was not there, maybe like the US, I would have been forced to come with

04:21:30.360 --> 04:21:36.000
[Guest]: my surgery, stitches still unhealed and come into work and sit at a desk crying because

04:21:36.000 --> 04:21:40.440
[Guest]: I'm still undergoing postpartum depression and my baby is, one week old baby is being

04:21:40.440 --> 04:21:41.440
[Guest]: handled by someone else.

04:21:41.440 --> 04:21:46.440
[Guest]: So, that real impact meri life mein, it has made my life tangibly better, even though

04:21:46.440 --> 04:21:49.760
[Guest]: I agree with you that in the long run, it has hurt women professionally.

04:21:49.760 --> 04:21:51.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, that's unseen, right?

04:21:51.320 --> 04:21:54.600
[Amit Varma]: All the women who didn't have a job to begin with, because they never got hired, because

04:21:54.600 --> 04:21:57.200
[Amit Varma]: incentive, because it's perverted the incentives.

04:21:57.200 --> 04:22:01.360
[Amit Varma]: I totally agree with you on the desirability of it, but can it be enforced by the state

04:22:01.360 --> 04:22:02.360
[Amit Varma]: as a...

04:22:02.360 --> 04:22:04.200
[Guest]: Yeah, that's what, so the way we do it is different.

04:22:04.200 --> 04:22:08.520
[Guest]: But I think my point and that I've made in the piece also is I'm not taking a stand on

04:22:08.520 --> 04:22:14.000
[Guest]: how it should be done, but this is something that will solve a huge amount of gender issues,

04:22:14.000 --> 04:22:16.960
[Guest]: not just at the workplace, but also in our private lives.

04:22:16.960 --> 04:22:19.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

04:22:19.720 --> 04:22:25.840
[Amit Varma]: So let's now go to the other domain where women are kind of also stuck and there's no

04:22:25.840 --> 04:22:28.900
[Amit Varma]: getting away from it, which is a domain of the home, right?

04:22:28.900 --> 04:22:35.640
[Amit Varma]: And this is also where stereotypes about what roles are, can be particularly pernicious.

04:22:35.640 --> 04:22:39.760
[Amit Varma]: And you've written a great post, which also became incredibly viral, I think it's one

04:22:39.760 --> 04:22:42.640
[Amit Varma]: of your most popular posts called the Raja Beta Syndrome.

04:22:42.640 --> 04:22:43.880
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about Raja Beta.

04:22:43.880 --> 04:22:44.880
[Guest]: What is Raja Beta?

04:22:44.880 --> 04:22:49.560
[Guest]: So Raja Beta Syndrome was one of those posts, which I wrote thinking that this is very obvious.

04:22:49.560 --> 04:22:52.400
[Guest]: Like you said, you know, everyone knows what's in it.

04:22:52.400 --> 04:22:58.120
[Guest]: As literally, it was like a slow work week at womaning, and I wrote that post, like everyone

04:22:58.120 --> 04:23:01.360
[Guest]: knows this story, let's write this this time.

04:23:01.360 --> 04:23:07.440
[Guest]: And somehow it just caught on, and to this day, I get screenshots from people that, you

04:23:07.440 --> 04:23:10.960
[Guest]: know, I'm on so and so WhatsApp group, and randomly someone's posted your Raja Beta piece

04:23:10.960 --> 04:23:14.080
[Guest]: there and I'm like, he's still roaming around.

04:23:14.080 --> 04:23:16.040
[Guest]: But it has, it took a life of its own.

04:23:16.040 --> 04:23:21.200
[Guest]: So Raja Beta Syndrome is essentially that in the Indian, average Indian family, we will

04:23:21.200 --> 04:23:25.360
[Guest]: treat our boys as royalty, right from the day they're born.

04:23:25.360 --> 04:23:29.160
[Guest]: And even before they're born, we are doing gender selection of children, infants and

04:23:29.160 --> 04:23:30.320
[Guest]: fetuses.

04:23:30.320 --> 04:23:37.360
[Guest]: But even the, and during childhood, obviously, partial treatment to the son.

04:23:37.360 --> 04:23:42.280
[Guest]: But the interesting bit is that even after they grow into adults, we continue to treat

04:23:42.280 --> 04:23:45.920
[Guest]: our sons like Rajas and princes actually, Rajkumar.

04:23:45.920 --> 04:23:53.440
[Guest]: So and then it's a very common, in the Hindi belt at least, thing for parents, especially

04:23:53.440 --> 04:23:55.840
[Guest]: mothers to say, yeh mera Raja beta hai.

04:23:55.840 --> 04:23:57.720
[Amit Varma]: And that's how you show love.

04:23:57.720 --> 04:23:59.880
[Guest]: Raja beta, Raja.

04:23:59.880 --> 04:24:06.440
[Guest]: So that's, that's how many North Indian parents and mothers especially will show love to the

04:24:06.440 --> 04:24:07.440
[Guest]: child.

04:24:07.440 --> 04:24:11.040
[Guest]: And theek hai for jab tak wo beta chhota sa beta hai, theek hai, ab banao Raja beta hai.

04:24:11.040 --> 04:24:16.040
[Guest]: And there is obviously no Rani beti, but fir bhi, ab banao, ab theek hai, it's a, it's

04:24:16.040 --> 04:24:18.080
[Guest]: a child ultimately, and it's getting love.

04:24:18.080 --> 04:24:22.760
[Guest]: It's sad that the other child is not getting as much love, but children, all children receive

04:24:22.760 --> 04:24:24.320
[Guest]: and deserve love.

04:24:24.320 --> 04:24:26.440
[Guest]: So theek hai, up to that point, it's fine.

04:24:26.440 --> 04:24:31.640
[Guest]: But the funny thing is when you grow up and you're a 40 year old man and 60 year old man

04:24:31.640 --> 04:24:35.280
[Guest]: and you're still the Raja beta of the house, that's where it gets funny.

04:24:35.280 --> 04:24:41.280
[Guest]: So this, this piece is a compilation of many stories from women about how many of them

04:24:41.280 --> 04:24:46.040
[Guest]: are in quote unquote equal marriages where the man is also doing the dishes, the man

04:24:46.040 --> 04:24:50.480
[Guest]: is also helping in the kitchen and couple, especially before children, like I said, it

04:24:50.480 --> 04:24:54.320
[Guest]: is possible to have some semblance of equality or equity.

04:24:54.320 --> 04:25:01.360
[Guest]: And chal riya life waisi, but suddenly, saas-sasur aake rehna shuru inge and women have said

04:25:01.360 --> 04:25:08.160
[Guest]: that we visibly see a difference in our husbands, that they just turn into some other creatures

04:25:08.160 --> 04:25:12.880
[Guest]: and they turn into this creature called Raja beta, which is ke paani ka glass utha karke

04:25:12.880 --> 04:25:14.240
[Guest]: kitchen mein nahi rakhna hai.

04:25:14.240 --> 04:25:18.840
[Guest]: So there's a story there about how there's this couple settled in London and she's, the

04:25:18.840 --> 04:25:22.960
[Guest]: wife is working at her desk and she tells the husband, can you just refill my glass

04:25:22.960 --> 04:25:27.960
[Guest]: of water and he does it and the mother-in-law who's visiting them is horrified and next

04:25:27.960 --> 04:25:32.320
[Guest]: time she's keeping an eye on that glass, ke kab iska paani thoda kam ho and runs and

04:25:32.320 --> 04:25:36.960
[Guest]: picks up that glass and goes back to the kitchen to refill it, ke kahi mein Raja beta ko ungli

04:25:36.960 --> 04:25:40.200
[Guest]: nahi uthaani par jaye, should not have to lift a finger.

04:25:40.200 --> 04:25:46.040
[Guest]: And so similarly, ke bartan karte hua, acha nahi lagta beta karta hua, main kar dungi.

04:25:46.040 --> 04:25:51.440
[Guest]: So mothers-in-law are most guilty of this, ke don't disturb him, I will do this.

04:25:51.440 --> 04:25:56.240
[Guest]: There's a story of a mother whose breastfeeding mother just gone back to work, so life is

04:25:56.240 --> 04:25:58.240
[Guest]: as stressful as it can be.

04:25:58.240 --> 04:26:02.160
[Guest]: And she says, I come back home and my mother-in-law is already in the kitchen, the husband has

04:26:02.160 --> 04:26:07.240
[Guest]: reached before but he's watching TV and mother-in-law has already got a list of chores ready for

04:26:07.240 --> 04:26:08.240
[Guest]: me.

04:26:08.240 --> 04:26:12.920
[Guest]: When I still have to feed the baby, I still have come back after a long commute from work,

04:26:12.920 --> 04:26:18.520
[Guest]: this fellow sitting at home working from home and watching TV and if I try to involve him

04:26:18.520 --> 04:26:23.000
[Guest]: also in the chores, she'll come and physically body-block me that nahi, nahi, usko disturb

04:26:23.000 --> 04:26:24.680
[Guest]: mat karo, wo aaraam kar raha hai.

04:26:24.680 --> 04:26:25.680
[Guest]: Physically body-block me?

04:26:25.680 --> 04:26:27.840
[Guest]: Basically, yeah, that happens.

04:26:27.840 --> 04:26:32.000
[Guest]: So I mean, so that's, those were the stories that I got from many women and I put them

04:26:32.000 --> 04:26:39.760
[Guest]: together and I used this from the movie Mughal-e-Azam and how Dilip Kumar ke around sab log dance

04:26:39.760 --> 04:26:44.240
[Guest]: chal raha hai, pyaar kiya toh dar na kiya, sab log usko aankhe wo, Anarkali usko gulab

04:26:44.240 --> 04:26:50.720
[Guest]: deti hai aur Raj Mata is looking at him with those heart-shaped eyes and so that's pretty

04:26:50.720 --> 04:26:54.960
[Guest]: much how it plays out in most Indian households and it really struck a chord.

04:26:54.960 --> 04:27:00.280
[Guest]: Like I said, for me it was a very obvious, almost banal thing that I wrote but then when

04:27:00.280 --> 04:27:06.120
[Guest]: I wrote, put it out, women were like this, yahi, yahi toh hai, sachai, yahi hai asliyat

04:27:06.120 --> 04:27:07.960
[Guest]: and so to this day, it's being circulated.

04:27:07.960 --> 04:27:11.840
[Guest]: I keep getting messages of people who've just discovered it and loved it.

04:27:11.840 --> 04:27:16.600
[Amit Varma]: In fact, one of your GIFs there has this caption of Raj Mata ji looking really upset and I

04:27:16.600 --> 04:27:22.200
[Amit Varma]: love the caption which is Raj Mata, when Raja beta accidentally does a chore and you've

04:27:22.200 --> 04:27:25.440
[Amit Varma]: also sort of pointed out something that I found really amusing that a couple of the

04:27:25.440 --> 04:27:29.840
[Amit Varma]: women were I think talking about how normally my husband helps out but when his parents

04:27:29.840 --> 04:27:34.160
[Amit Varma]: come he will try to hide that he's helping out, you know, which is a very interesting

04:27:34.160 --> 04:27:39.560
[Amit Varma]: kind of preference falsification because preference falsification is when you feel one way but

04:27:39.560 --> 04:27:43.040
[Amit Varma]: the general norm is something else so you don't show it, right?

04:27:43.040 --> 04:27:48.600
[Amit Varma]: And normally the way preference falsification plays out is that you feel something regressive,

04:27:48.600 --> 04:27:49.600
[Unknown]: right?

04:27:49.600 --> 04:27:54.880
[Amit Varma]: Like, but because you're not supposed to say these things in a polite society, you don't

04:27:54.880 --> 04:27:58.640
[Amit Varma]: say it, you know, unless a switch is flicked or something and here it's like the other

04:27:58.640 --> 04:28:04.040
[Amit Varma]: way around, that the guy actually feels something progressive, he feels he should help his wife

04:28:04.040 --> 04:28:08.560
[Amit Varma]: but he's scared to kind of act out on it in front of his mother or his parents or whatever

04:28:08.560 --> 04:28:09.560
[Guest]: which is...

04:28:09.560 --> 04:28:14.600
[Guest]: Right, so preference falsification is about hiding shameful feelings and so that's the

04:28:14.600 --> 04:28:18.680
[Guest]: point I'm trying to make that wanting to be an equal husband to your wife is a shameful

04:28:18.680 --> 04:28:21.080
[Amit Varma]: feeling to this day.

04:28:21.080 --> 04:28:28.360
[Amit Varma]: Another sort of stereotype which hobbles women at home is the pressure to make babies, right?

04:28:28.360 --> 04:28:35.280
[Amit Varma]: Like you have a post about this as well about how so many women are just looked at as child

04:28:35.280 --> 04:28:40.520
[Amit Varma]: bearing vessels, that if you haven't had a child, it's a problem, you know, random uncles

04:28:40.520 --> 04:28:45.040
[Amit Varma]: you meet once in eight years will be saying when is a good news beta and so on and so

04:28:45.040 --> 04:28:46.040
[Amit Varma]: forth.

04:28:46.040 --> 04:28:52.160
[Amit Varma]: At some point, you know, one of your, I think, was it you writing about yourself or one of

04:28:52.160 --> 04:28:56.080
[Amit Varma]: your guests, where good things happen at this gathering and everybody's congratulating you

04:28:56.080 --> 04:29:01.040
[Amit Varma]: and all and then this auntie lady type calls you to the side and instead of congratulating

04:29:01.040 --> 04:29:05.560
[Amit Varma]: you about how well your career is going, she says, yeh sab toh hota rahega, tum yeh batao

04:29:05.560 --> 04:29:07.040
[Guest]: ki bachche karne ka kya plan hai.

04:29:07.040 --> 04:29:08.040
[Guest]: Yeah, that was me.

04:29:08.040 --> 04:29:09.040
[Amit Varma]: That was you.

04:29:09.040 --> 04:29:10.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

04:29:10.040 --> 04:29:13.760
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about how these pressures play out because like one of the themes I've

04:29:13.760 --> 04:29:21.080
[Amit Varma]: been exploring in past episodes is this distinction between thick and thin desires, where thick

04:29:21.080 --> 04:29:26.180
[Amit Varma]: desires are desires which are kind of intrinsic to you, but thin desires are mimetic desires.

04:29:26.180 --> 04:29:29.640
[Amit Varma]: So they are mimetic desires in the sense that you want something because somebody else wants

04:29:29.640 --> 04:29:35.400
[Amit Varma]: it or it seems like something that is you start desiring it not for rational reasons

04:29:35.400 --> 04:29:38.040
[Amit Varma]: of your own, but because it seems something like that.

04:29:38.040 --> 04:29:42.520
[Amit Varma]: So I could want a Mercedes C class and that's a thin desire because it's not intrinsic.

04:29:42.520 --> 04:29:47.160
[Amit Varma]: Or I think the most common thin desire would be people wanting to get married and have

04:29:47.160 --> 04:29:48.160
[Guest]: kids.

04:29:48.160 --> 04:29:49.160
[Guest]: Right, right.

04:29:49.160 --> 04:29:52.920
[Amit Varma]: And they may not intrinsically crave the companionship or any of the things that are beautiful about

04:29:52.920 --> 04:29:57.640
[Amit Varma]: marriage or they may not crave parenthood or they may not even want to be parents.

04:29:57.640 --> 04:30:01.740
[Amit Varma]: But it's just the way that life unfolds and therefore you're supposed to do it.

04:30:01.740 --> 04:30:07.320
[Amit Varma]: And is this a sort of chakra view that women are then trapped in, that once you enter the

04:30:07.320 --> 04:30:10.200
[Amit Varma]: flow of things, it's incredibly hard to get out.

04:30:10.200 --> 04:30:14.640
[Amit Varma]: So even if you're in a, you know, relatively modern marriage where you and your partner

04:30:14.640 --> 04:30:19.280
[Amit Varma]: can decide that you don't want to do it, but despite that, those pressures are sort of

04:30:19.280 --> 04:30:20.280
[Amit Varma]: there.

04:30:20.280 --> 04:30:22.000
[Amit Varma]: It's just this constant din in your head.

04:30:22.000 --> 04:30:23.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:30:23.000 --> 04:30:29.640
[Guest]: No, so those are definitely there and they're expressed much more strongly or enforced much

04:30:29.640 --> 04:30:31.840
[Guest]: more strongly on women than on men.

04:30:31.840 --> 04:30:36.960
[Guest]: So yeah, there is a thing, timeline about you have to be married by this age.

04:30:36.960 --> 04:30:40.920
[Guest]: And again, that timeline is much more flexible for men than for women, not just for biological

04:30:40.920 --> 04:30:43.140
[Guest]: reasons, but also social reasons.

04:30:43.140 --> 04:30:51.320
[Guest]: So a 40 year old man is still, obviously our single son, but a 30 year old single woman

04:30:51.320 --> 04:30:55.080
[Guest]: is just the worst thing that has happened to our parents ever.

04:30:55.080 --> 04:30:59.440
[Guest]: So that's, I've also been on the receiving side of it because by Punjabi standards, I

04:30:59.440 --> 04:31:00.440
[Guest]: married late.

04:31:00.440 --> 04:31:07.480
[Guest]: And so my single status was like a societal issue being discussed often at large social

04:31:07.480 --> 04:31:08.480
[Guest]: gatherings.

04:31:08.480 --> 04:31:12.160
[Guest]: And so, I mean, again, credit to my parents that they didn't let a lot of that pressure

04:31:12.160 --> 04:31:13.880
[Guest]: transfer to me.

04:31:13.880 --> 04:31:19.760
[Guest]: And I also very consciously was living across, halfway across the country to avoid that.

04:31:19.760 --> 04:31:26.040
[Guest]: But it is real, it was not a big desire for me in my life at that point of time.

04:31:26.040 --> 04:31:29.600
[Guest]: But it was just something that you, thin desire is something that you want because you're

04:31:29.600 --> 04:31:31.680
[Guest]: supposed to want it, essentially.

04:31:31.680 --> 04:31:35.080
[Guest]: So it was just that, oh, you should want to get married because you should want to get

04:31:35.080 --> 04:31:36.080
[Guest]: married.

04:31:36.080 --> 04:31:38.520
[Guest]: There's no better reason for it.

04:31:38.520 --> 04:31:44.200
[Guest]: And in that rush for these thin desires, we also ignore the quality aspect of it, that

04:31:44.200 --> 04:31:48.920
[Guest]: it should be a good marriage is not something that's on the agenda.

04:31:48.920 --> 04:31:50.280
[Guest]: It has to be a marriage.

04:31:50.280 --> 04:31:54.760
[Guest]: That is all that we want, right, from women, shadi karlo bas, kisi se karlo.

04:31:54.760 --> 04:32:00.640
[Guest]: So and over time, even our standards of the kind of guy will keep falling because tumhara

04:32:00.640 --> 04:32:02.280
[Guest]: shelf life khatam ho raha hai.

04:32:02.280 --> 04:32:07.360
[Guest]: So it's actually getting worse as you're aging because your prospects will be much thinner.

04:32:07.360 --> 04:32:10.440
[Guest]: And many points in my life, I've been told that I will not be able to find a husband

04:32:10.440 --> 04:32:13.880
[Guest]: while I was single for various reasons.

04:32:13.880 --> 04:32:19.120
[Guest]: So so yeah, this is this this pressure is real on women and the pressure similarly to

04:32:19.120 --> 04:32:21.240
[Guest]: have kids is very real.

04:32:21.240 --> 04:32:25.760
[Guest]: And I think I've given an example of a woman who was in an abusive marriage also, who was

04:32:25.760 --> 04:32:27.120
[Guest]: being forced ke bachcha karlo.

04:32:27.120 --> 04:32:31.960
[Guest]: So that's another very classic Indian thing ke you are in already in a toxic relationship

04:32:31.960 --> 04:32:36.480
[Guest]: which which needs to end, which deserves to end, which should be ended.

04:32:36.480 --> 04:32:40.960
[Guest]: And instead, the solution that society chipkaos on it is bachcha karlo.

04:32:40.960 --> 04:32:44.720
[Guest]: And bachcha is not going to solve a bad marriage, it's going to make things worse, because bachcha

04:32:44.720 --> 04:32:47.440
[Guest]: is a huge amount of responsibility.

04:32:47.440 --> 04:32:52.880
[Guest]: And you should not bring a child into a marriage that is already already disturbed in any way.

04:32:52.880 --> 04:32:56.600
[Guest]: I mean, I personally feel there should be an entrance exam before having kids.

04:32:56.600 --> 04:33:00.240
[Amit Varma]: Aap toh coercive hand of state har cheez me.

04:33:00.240 --> 04:33:03.160
[Guest]: Har cheez me daal toh mere aisaam se toh.

04:33:03.160 --> 04:33:07.040
[Guest]: Ek UPSC ka exam iske le bhi rakho ki certificate jab tak nahi halega, bachche nahi kar sakte

04:33:07.040 --> 04:33:08.040
[Guest]: hai.

04:33:08.040 --> 04:33:13.160
[Guest]: So, screwed up situations in which I have seen kids being brought into is criminal.

04:33:13.160 --> 04:33:17.400
[Guest]: So I don't agree with you that having kids is immoral, but it is immoral to have kids

04:33:17.400 --> 04:33:18.400
[Guest]: in such situations.

04:33:18.400 --> 04:33:23.120
[Amit Varma]: When you're not ready, which I think is actually the, I love this poem by Philip Larkin, so

04:33:23.120 --> 04:33:24.800
[Amit Varma]: I'm just going to read it out here.

04:33:24.800 --> 04:33:26.640
[Amit Varma]: It's called this be the worst.

04:33:26.640 --> 04:33:30.040
[Amit Varma]: They fuck you up your mom and dad, they may not mean to, but they do.

04:33:30.040 --> 04:33:33.840
[Amit Varma]: They fill you with the faults they had and add some extra just for you.

04:33:33.840 --> 04:33:38.320
[Amit Varma]: But they were fucked up in their turn by fools in old style hats and coats, who half the

04:33:38.320 --> 04:33:41.760
[Amit Varma]: time was soppy stern and half at one another's throats.

04:33:41.760 --> 04:33:45.520
[Amit Varma]: Man hands on misery to man, it deepens like a coastal shelf.

04:33:45.520 --> 04:33:49.120
[Amit Varma]: Get out as early as you can, and don't have any kids yourself.

04:33:49.120 --> 04:33:50.120
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

04:33:50.120 --> 04:33:53.920
[Amit Varma]: And I love these lines also just as poetry man hands on misery to man it deepens like

04:33:53.920 --> 04:33:54.920
[Amit Varma]: a coastal shelf.

04:33:54.920 --> 04:33:57.080
[Amit Varma]: What a lovely line.

04:33:57.080 --> 04:34:05.680
[Amit Varma]: Let's sort of talk about, you know, another aspect that I think is unseen to most people.

04:34:05.680 --> 04:34:10.360
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps often women may not also think about it in these terms, which is mental load,

04:34:10.360 --> 04:34:14.320
[Amit Varma]: which is an invisible labor of managing a household.

04:34:14.320 --> 04:34:17.960
[Amit Varma]: Now I'll quote these lovely lines because, you know, you might be modest about this,

04:34:17.960 --> 04:34:20.080
[Amit Varma]: but a lot of your writing really sparkles.

04:34:20.080 --> 04:34:26.280
[Amit Varma]: And these lines are from the end of your post on this where you write quote, men, can I

04:34:26.280 --> 04:34:27.480
[Amit Varma]: tell you a secret?

04:34:27.480 --> 04:34:31.440
[Amit Varma]: If you think that the romance in your life has dwindled after a few years of marriage,

04:34:31.440 --> 04:34:37.120
[Amit Varma]: it might be because your wife is now basically a grocery list trapped in the body of a woman.

04:34:37.120 --> 04:34:39.800
[Amit Varma]: Try taking some of the mental load off her brain.

04:34:39.800 --> 04:34:43.720
[Amit Varma]: And behold, as she begins to turn human again, stop quote.

04:34:43.720 --> 04:34:47.160
[Amit Varma]: And then you point out that your husband just installed a grocery app on his phone and you

04:34:47.160 --> 04:34:48.480
[Amit Varma]: love him more than ever.

04:34:48.480 --> 04:34:53.640
[Amit Varma]: But elaborate on this a bit a grocery list trapped in the body of a woman.

04:34:53.640 --> 04:34:58.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, elaborate on this because I, you know, someone like me, when I'm working on

04:34:58.280 --> 04:35:02.660
[Amit Varma]: something during the day, I have the luxury of locking myself in my room and thinking

04:35:02.660 --> 04:35:05.680
[Amit Varma]: of nothing but whatever it is that I'm working on.

04:35:05.680 --> 04:35:06.680
[Unknown]: Women can never do that.

04:35:06.680 --> 04:35:07.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

04:35:07.680 --> 04:35:08.680
[Amit Varma]: Right.

04:35:08.680 --> 04:35:09.680
[Amit Varma]: Mostly.

04:35:09.680 --> 04:35:10.680
[Guest]: Tell me a little bit about why.

04:35:10.680 --> 04:35:11.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:35:11.680 --> 04:35:15.840
[Guest]: I think I've heard in one of your episodes, you criticizing people who criticize Gal Newport,

04:35:15.840 --> 04:35:17.560
[Guest]: the deep work thing.

04:35:17.560 --> 04:35:23.080
[Guest]: And people, people like me basically who say that deep work are privileges available only

04:35:23.080 --> 04:35:24.080
[Amit Varma]: to men.

04:35:24.080 --> 04:35:25.080
[Amit Varma]: No, I say that myself.

04:35:25.080 --> 04:35:30.320
[Amit Varma]: But I think criticizing Gal Newport for it is not fair because Newport actually, for

04:35:30.320 --> 04:35:33.960
[Amit Varma]: those who've read the book, he talks about four models of work.

04:35:33.960 --> 04:35:37.400
[Amit Varma]: And that deep work thing where you lock yourself up for a long period of time is one of those

04:35:37.400 --> 04:35:38.400
[Amit Varma]: four models of work.

04:35:38.400 --> 04:35:43.560
[Amit Varma]: There are other models of work, which, you know, the way Walter Isaacson, for example,

04:35:43.560 --> 04:35:47.340
[Amit Varma]: does it switching on and off is what women are basically doing all the time.

04:35:47.340 --> 04:35:48.340
[Amit Varma]: So I don't think so.

04:35:48.340 --> 04:35:50.720
[Amit Varma]: I think people attack a straw man version of the book.

04:35:50.720 --> 04:35:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, as I said earlier, I agree that, you know, that women have it much harder and

04:35:56.040 --> 04:36:00.040
[Amit Varma]: even some men have it much harder that you cannot, you may not always have the luck and

04:36:00.040 --> 04:36:02.800
[Amit Varma]: the privilege to set aside large chunks of time.

04:36:02.800 --> 04:36:04.440
[Amit Varma]: But that's not what Newport is saying.

04:36:04.440 --> 04:36:07.840
[Amit Varma]: Newport is laying out a bouquet of options, but sorry, carry on.

04:36:07.840 --> 04:36:08.840
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:36:08.840 --> 04:36:14.880
[Guest]: So I mean, I find most of male self-help and productivity hacks and tips to be very, have

04:36:14.880 --> 04:36:19.720
[Guest]: to have that carry that blind spot with them that they're designed by men and for men.

04:36:19.720 --> 04:36:25.720
[Guest]: And it's not things that women can ever conceivably do because, again, of the gender roles that

04:36:25.720 --> 04:36:31.720
[Guest]: we have and the extra amount of responsibility that is thrust on women.

04:36:31.720 --> 04:36:34.800
[Guest]: So yeah, how, what it means to be a walking grocery list.

04:36:34.800 --> 04:36:41.720
[Guest]: So I am a walking grocery list and the, another analogy that my husband and I often use is

04:36:41.720 --> 04:36:42.720
[Guest]: tabs.

04:36:42.720 --> 04:36:46.400
[Guest]: Mere dimaag mein kitni tabs open hai, like on a browser.

04:36:46.400 --> 04:36:50.160
[Guest]: At any point of time, I'm like, I have got like dhai so tabs open in my mind.

04:36:50.160 --> 04:36:54.920
[Guest]: It's equivalent of how much stress it is when you have dhai so tabs open on your browser.

04:36:54.920 --> 04:36:57.960
[Guest]: That's how many things I'm thinking of at any given point of time.

04:36:57.960 --> 04:37:02.080
[Guest]: I think this conversation with you is the, probably the longest break that I have taken

04:37:02.080 --> 04:37:06.440
[Guest]: away from child care in probably forever since I had a kid.

04:37:06.440 --> 04:37:11.040
[Guest]: So I mean, even now there are things that I'm thinking of which are happening behind,

04:37:11.040 --> 04:37:13.600
[Guest]: I mean, what's happening with the baby.

04:37:13.600 --> 04:37:18.440
[Guest]: School se kisi ne pick up kiya ke nahi, khana khaya hoga ke nahi, wo face pe rash ho rahi

04:37:18.440 --> 04:37:24.400
[Guest]: thi uspe kisi ne cream lagayi ke nahi, wo jo school se ek note aaya tha uske liye, us

04:37:24.400 --> 04:37:28.640
[Guest]: din ethnic kapde pehna ke bhejne hai, wo dhula hai kurta ke nahi dhula hai, and press ho

04:37:28.640 --> 04:37:32.800
[Guest]: ke aagaya hoga kya hai, aur wo press wali ne itne din se phone nahi kara usko bulana

04:37:32.800 --> 04:37:37.440
[Guest]: hai aur ek baat karne thi uska, wo account settle karna hai and this is how my brain

04:37:37.440 --> 04:37:42.440
[Guest]: goes and I just go on and on and on and this is how many, most women will think.

04:37:42.440 --> 04:37:47.520
[Guest]: So sometimes I mean, I'm looking like my system is going to crash and I have to tell Salil

04:37:47.520 --> 04:37:53.800
[Guest]: that listen, too many tabs, not able to function anymore and then he'll say, okay, let's sit

04:37:53.800 --> 04:37:56.720
[Guest]: down and we'll write it down or something.

04:37:56.720 --> 04:37:59.120
[Guest]: But the fact of the matter is these tabs are not open in his mind.

04:37:59.120 --> 04:38:05.920
[Guest]: I mean, as much eager and genuine partner that he wants to be, these tabs are not, are

04:38:05.920 --> 04:38:07.520
[Guest]: only there in my mind.

04:38:07.520 --> 04:38:14.400
[Guest]: And then there are many, this is again, well-documented phenomena and men have many rationals, excuses,

04:38:14.400 --> 04:38:19.560
[Guest]: explanations for it, ke, oh ye to, you have higher standards and that's why you have these

04:38:19.560 --> 04:38:23.640
[Guest]: tabs, like most of the things you're thinking of don't actually need to be done.

04:38:23.640 --> 04:38:27.640
[Guest]: But then when they're not done is when you realize the fallout of it.

04:38:27.640 --> 04:38:33.560
[Guest]: So, so much work that you're doing is preemptive and it is again, therefore unseen, you know,

04:38:33.560 --> 04:38:36.240
[Guest]: because those women who never had those jobs, you don't know about them.

04:38:36.240 --> 04:38:40.800
[Guest]: So similarly, all those accidents that didn't happen because I baby-proofed the house are

04:38:40.800 --> 04:38:44.920
[Guest]: things that we don't know about at all because how many times he bumped his head on the edge

04:38:44.920 --> 04:38:49.080
[Guest]: of a baby-proof table is not something that we are keeping count of.

04:38:49.080 --> 04:38:54.520
[Guest]: So these are things that mental load that, that is only there on women because physical

04:38:54.520 --> 04:38:59.400
[Guest]: load to a lot of extent, the more evolved of partners are able to share.

04:38:59.400 --> 04:39:07.120
[Guest]: So like even in my household, laundry or yesab, things that the chores that we are still doing

04:39:07.120 --> 04:39:11.600
[Guest]: that we don't have a help for, chores are equally distributed between us.

04:39:11.600 --> 04:39:17.840
[Guest]: Even the time that we spend with our child is, now that I'm also after COVID doing full-time

04:39:17.840 --> 04:39:26.000
[Guest]: work is relatively fair division, not equal but equitable.

04:39:26.000 --> 04:39:33.480
[Guest]: But this is one place where there is no semblance of equalities, like 99% is only 1% there.

04:39:33.480 --> 04:39:38.120
[Guest]: And so, so, and it's all sorts of labor, you know, it's also about, tumhari mumme ka birthday

04:39:38.120 --> 04:39:41.320
[Guest]: aane wala hai, mujhe yaad hai unko ek gift kharid ki Amazon se mahaan bhejna hai.

04:39:41.320 --> 04:39:44.480
[Guest]: So you know, these things also, it's also emotional labor.

04:39:44.480 --> 04:39:48.680
[Guest]: It's also that so-and-so helped us at that time, now we should go there about to have

04:39:48.680 --> 04:39:51.080
[Guest]: a baby, we should go help them with this thing.

04:39:51.080 --> 04:39:55.240
[Guest]: All of these burdens, managing relationships, keeping the household running, even when you

04:39:55.240 --> 04:40:00.400
[Guest]: do have staff, the staff wants to come, bhabhi se baat karni hai, because I have this issue,

04:40:00.400 --> 04:40:02.160
[Guest]: mujhe us din chutti chahiye.

04:40:02.160 --> 04:40:07.200
[Guest]: Now you have to plan your house around that, things, ration khatam ho raha hai kitchen mein,

04:40:07.200 --> 04:40:08.200
[Guest]: you have to do this.

04:40:08.200 --> 04:40:11.960
[Guest]: And so, this is what I've written about in the piece also, and this is the, I think the

04:40:11.960 --> 04:40:14.880
[Guest]: second most popular piece after Raja Beta.

04:40:14.880 --> 04:40:18.100
[Guest]: Because again, it struck a chord with so many women, like women wrote to me after this that

04:40:18.100 --> 04:40:23.920
[Guest]: my husband is VP Finance in one of the biggest firms in India, and yet he's not able to manage

04:40:23.920 --> 04:40:27.720
[Guest]: ghar mein aata khatam ho raha hai, he's not able to keep it stocked.

04:40:27.720 --> 04:40:31.440
[Guest]: So am I supposed to believe that he's incompetent and he's not able to do this?

04:40:31.440 --> 04:40:35.240
[Guest]: Obviously he's able to do this, he's intelligent enough to do it.

04:40:35.240 --> 04:40:40.960
[Guest]: It's just a matter of kar rahi hai na woh, why should I step up?

04:40:40.960 --> 04:40:45.000
[Guest]: And so over time, then one person gets stuck with that role.

04:40:45.000 --> 04:40:48.000
[Guest]: And then that person also gets stuck in their mind about the way it is to be done.

04:40:48.000 --> 04:40:52.720
[Guest]: So you know, like your podcast, how you edit it, how you design it, something you've been

04:40:52.720 --> 04:40:58.160
[Guest]: doing for so long that now, it might not even be easy for you to delegate some key aspect

04:40:58.160 --> 04:40:59.160
[Guest]: of it.

04:40:59.160 --> 04:41:02.160
[Guest]: Or if I come and do it for you, you might not like it the way I've done it.

04:41:02.160 --> 04:41:03.360
[Guest]: And so that also happens.

04:41:03.360 --> 04:41:08.000
[Guest]: So it then, even when men try to help, sometimes women will push back.

04:41:08.000 --> 04:41:09.000
[Guest]: And it happens to me also.

04:41:09.000 --> 04:41:11.400
[Guest]: Sometimes I'll say, you're doing it all wrong, let me do it myself.

04:41:11.400 --> 04:41:14.960
[Guest]: Aur tumne galat tarah ka chawal order kar di.

04:41:14.960 --> 04:41:17.600
[Guest]: So now I will do it, I have to do everything myself.

04:41:17.600 --> 04:41:20.840
[Guest]: And then we'll have a discussion about it, then I'll realize that, you know, I'm right

04:41:20.840 --> 04:41:25.000
[Guest]: now gatekeeping something that I don't really have to, and I need to consciously let go

04:41:25.000 --> 04:41:26.000
[Guest]: of this.

04:41:26.000 --> 04:41:29.780
[Guest]: Because I've been doing it for so long, and I've become set in the way that I do it.

04:41:29.780 --> 04:41:33.880
[Guest]: And therefore the man feels ke not worth the trouble, let her handle it.

04:41:33.880 --> 04:41:39.920
[Guest]: But that in the long run breeds this resentment and this gap, the chasm between us of how

04:41:39.920 --> 04:41:41.760
[Guest]: many tabs are open in whose mind.

04:41:41.760 --> 04:41:42.760
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

04:41:42.760 --> 04:41:48.360
[Amit Varma]: And that metaphor of tabs open is really quite, you know, hits home, because you know what

04:41:48.360 --> 04:41:52.680
[Amit Varma]: happens when Chrome crashes, and everything just sort of freezes right there, you've got

04:41:52.680 --> 04:41:57.200
[Amit Varma]: another great post called fabulous lives of Indian housewives, which I'm sure is also

04:41:57.200 --> 04:42:02.960
[Amit Varma]: extremely popular, where you quote someone called Anu, who says something that speaks

04:42:02.960 --> 04:42:07.680
[Amit Varma]: exactly to what you were just saying, where she says, quote, it angers me that for ages,

04:42:07.680 --> 04:42:08.880
[Amit Varma]: men have been chilling.

04:42:08.880 --> 04:42:14.480
[Amit Varma]: And by chilling, I mean having a normal intellectually stimulating adult day at work, and also coming

04:42:14.480 --> 04:42:17.280
[Amit Varma]: home to their wives expecting to be pampered.

04:42:17.280 --> 04:42:21.240
[Amit Varma]: All the while, the really hard physical and mental labor was done by the wife staying

04:42:21.240 --> 04:42:26.160
[Amit Varma]: back at home, I come to my office and feel incredibly grateful to have a place to poop

04:42:26.160 --> 04:42:27.160
[Amit Varma]: in peace.

04:42:27.160 --> 04:42:30.840
[Amit Varma]: I have nothing but respect for stay at home mothers now, stop good.

04:42:30.840 --> 04:42:36.640
[Amit Varma]: And this also underscores how, you know, some people might think of it as a dichotomy between

04:42:36.640 --> 04:42:41.820
[Amit Varma]: women who have chosen to work and who go to office and all of that, and stay at home mothers,

04:42:41.820 --> 04:42:44.400
[Amit Varma]: as if stay at home mothers are not doing anything.

04:42:44.400 --> 04:42:47.680
[Amit Varma]: And people will think of stay at home mothers, and they'll say, they'll be like, okay,

04:42:47.680 --> 04:42:51.880
[Amit Varma]: she's taking care of the house, or cooking food, but otherwise, she's just chilling,

04:42:51.880 --> 04:42:53.200
[Unknown]: you know.

04:42:53.200 --> 04:42:54.360
[Amit Varma]: But it's not like that at all.

04:42:54.360 --> 04:42:57.200
[Amit Varma]: It is an incredibly arduous amount of work.

04:42:57.200 --> 04:43:03.120
[Amit Varma]: And worst of all, it is the kind of work where you can't really focus on anything and get

04:43:03.120 --> 04:43:07.640
[Amit Varma]: deep work done, as it were, you know, in fact, if you read Newport's book, you'll find that

04:43:07.640 --> 04:43:09.240
[Amit Varma]: he has nothing but sympathy for this.

04:43:09.240 --> 04:43:14.080
[Amit Varma]: He describes this kind of situation, where people are constantly forced to be in a state

04:43:14.080 --> 04:43:15.400
[Amit Varma]: of shallow work.

04:43:15.400 --> 04:43:20.600
[Amit Varma]: And really, being in a state of shallow concentration is something that is good only for managers

04:43:20.600 --> 04:43:22.800
[Amit Varma]: who are scheduling meeting after meeting after meeting.

04:43:22.800 --> 04:43:27.400
[Amit Varma]: But to get any meaningful work done, you need to figure out a way to get deep work.

04:43:27.400 --> 04:43:32.760
[Amit Varma]: So you know, so often, progressive people will almost in a sense, even women kind of

04:43:32.760 --> 04:43:37.560
[Amit Varma]: look down on housewives and housewifery, as it were, and will think, oh, okay, if you're

04:43:37.560 --> 04:43:39.500
[Amit Varma]: a modern woman, you have to work.

04:43:39.500 --> 04:43:43.120
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, work is work, life is stuff, you know, something.

04:43:43.120 --> 04:43:47.480
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about this and about how mindsets around this revolve.

04:43:47.480 --> 04:43:53.760
[Guest]: Yeah, so I mean, like you said, it's not only that a woman working at home, first of all,

04:43:53.760 --> 04:44:00.360
[Guest]: I love this line from the book Invisible Women, which says that working woman is a tautology.

04:44:00.360 --> 04:44:05.320
[Guest]: It means that it's unnecessary to add the word working, because every woman is working.

04:44:05.320 --> 04:44:09.360
[Guest]: So it's only that some women are being paid for that work and some are not.

04:44:09.360 --> 04:44:13.360
[Guest]: So there's literally just no woman who's not working, even a stay at home mother is a working

04:44:13.360 --> 04:44:14.760
[Guest]: mother.

04:44:14.760 --> 04:44:17.600
[Guest]: And that for me was a very powerful statement.

04:44:17.600 --> 04:44:19.400
[Guest]: And it really makes sense.

04:44:19.400 --> 04:44:24.600
[Guest]: Because especially now I've seen being at home for two years for the pandemic before

04:44:24.600 --> 04:44:27.760
[Guest]: that on my maternity leave, and I've realized how hard it is.

04:44:27.760 --> 04:44:34.440
[Guest]: And I completely agree with Anu there that, you know, now that I go to a workplace, it's

04:44:34.440 --> 04:44:37.440
[Guest]: really recreation for me, it is relaxation.

04:44:37.440 --> 04:44:43.440
[Guest]: Like as a mother who is at home, you genuinely don't have time to poop in peace.

04:44:43.440 --> 04:44:48.560
[Guest]: Because there's always the door is open, because you're worried the child will go and put their

04:44:48.560 --> 04:44:50.900
[Guest]: finger in an electric socket or something.

04:44:50.900 --> 04:44:53.960
[Guest]: So often children are inside the bathroom when you're pooping.

04:44:53.960 --> 04:44:58.120
[Guest]: You don't get time to comb your hair, you barely get time to take a shower.

04:44:58.120 --> 04:45:00.640
[Guest]: Sometimes you don't remember if you brushed your teeth this morning or not.

04:45:00.640 --> 04:45:03.600
[Guest]: So that's the amount of stress that work is.

04:45:03.600 --> 04:45:10.120
[Guest]: And it is a work which comes with no perks, no compensation, and no breaks, right?

04:45:10.120 --> 04:45:13.880
[Guest]: Like if I have a very, very stressful work also, there is a weekend to look forward to,

04:45:13.880 --> 04:45:17.960
[Guest]: there is an evening where I clock out, something to look forward to.

04:45:17.960 --> 04:45:22.600
[Guest]: But as a mother, stay at home mother, there is no break, there will never be a day when

04:45:22.600 --> 04:45:27.640
[Guest]: you get, kya aaj bachche nahi, aaj chhutti hai bachche hone se, aur aaj relaxation hai.

04:45:27.640 --> 04:45:32.000
[Guest]: Unless your partner is kind enough to take them out of the house for a few hours.

04:45:32.000 --> 04:45:34.280
[Guest]: But other than that, it's a 24-7 job.

04:45:34.280 --> 04:45:39.320
[Guest]: So it's much more stressful and I mean, I've quoted Anu here because Anu and I used to

04:45:39.320 --> 04:45:42.360
[Guest]: work together when we were both single and living in Bombay.

04:45:42.360 --> 04:45:46.840
[Guest]: We worked together in the same company and we were taking a walk somewhere around our

04:45:46.840 --> 04:45:51.400
[Guest]: office one day and we saw a woman at a window.

04:45:51.400 --> 04:45:56.320
[Guest]: And so I began this piece with that and Anu was like, ek din main wo aurat banungi, ye

04:45:56.320 --> 04:46:02.200
[Guest]: meri aspiration hai, wo aurat jo face mask laga ke gharke pe baith ke chai piyegi, aur

04:46:02.200 --> 04:46:05.280
[Guest]: din main bhaar dekhe ki, ye dekho ye gadhe jaa rahe hain office.

04:46:05.280 --> 04:46:09.840
[Guest]: So that was the, I mean that was a running joke between us, ke hamari life ki aspiration

04:46:09.840 --> 04:46:14.000
[Guest]: hai ki ghar pe baithna aur chai peena aur face mask lagana hai.

04:46:14.000 --> 04:46:19.960
[Guest]: But now, I mean now that we are both mothers, we realize how blind that image of a stay

04:46:19.960 --> 04:46:25.120
[Guest]: at home mother is and that's how unfair it is and how far away from reality that perception

04:46:25.120 --> 04:46:26.120
[Guest]: is.

04:46:26.120 --> 04:46:28.000
[Amit Varma]: So that's really the hardest job there is.

04:46:28.000 --> 04:46:33.320
[Amit Varma]: And you've pointed out that one of the things that really irritates you is when people idolize

04:46:33.320 --> 04:46:39.200
[Amit Varma]: or romanticize the sacrifices that women make, you know, I think you reproduced that advertisement

04:46:39.200 --> 04:46:43.960
[Amit Varma]: in your post or it was a fake newswala meme that a woman with an oxygen cylinder on or

04:46:43.960 --> 04:46:48.240
[Amit Varma]: whatever covid ka mask was ka on is also cooking meal for the family and all that.

04:46:48.240 --> 04:46:52.800
[Amit Varma]: And you'll have these classic memes of superwoman with eight hands doing everything at once.

04:46:52.800 --> 04:46:57.760
[Amit Varma]: And your point is that, you know, in a sense, you're trying to glorify the woman who does

04:46:57.760 --> 04:46:58.760
[Amit Varma]: everything.

04:46:58.760 --> 04:47:00.720
[Amit Varma]: But your point is, no, don't romanticize that.

04:47:00.720 --> 04:47:01.720
[Unknown]: It's terrible.

04:47:01.720 --> 04:47:02.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

04:47:02.720 --> 04:47:06.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, the man who took the picture should really be doing all the work.

04:47:06.160 --> 04:47:11.080
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about this, because this seems to me to be particularly dangerous.

04:47:11.080 --> 04:47:15.360
[Amit Varma]: Because the moment you romanticize it, you make it a thin desire for many women ki mujhe

04:47:15.360 --> 04:47:17.640
[Amit Varma]: bhi banna hai superwoman, main bhi karungi.

04:47:17.640 --> 04:47:22.040
[Amit Varma]: And you make it something that men also then expect from their wives, right?

04:47:22.040 --> 04:47:23.880
[Guest]: So tell me a little bit about this.

04:47:23.880 --> 04:47:24.880
[Guest]: Exactly.

04:47:24.880 --> 04:47:25.880
[Guest]: And that wasn't fake news.

04:47:25.880 --> 04:47:29.880
[Guest]: That was a real photograph of his mother that a man had put up and his mother.

04:47:29.880 --> 04:47:30.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

04:47:30.880 --> 04:47:34.640
[Amit Varma]: I thought I was actually, I thought baad mein nikhla tha ki woh, achha maybe I'm maybe I'm

04:47:34.640 --> 04:47:36.160
[Amit Varma]: confusing it with some other picture.

04:47:36.160 --> 04:47:40.400
[Guest]: Maine aisa kuch nahi padha baad mein kyuki I was also googling that image later to write

04:47:40.400 --> 04:47:41.640
[Guest]: this piece.

04:47:41.640 --> 04:47:42.640
[Amit Varma]: Maybe again, I also might have missed it.

04:47:42.640 --> 04:47:44.400
[Amit Varma]: Maybe I'm mixing it up with some other picture.

04:47:44.400 --> 04:47:49.040
[Guest]: But yeah, this was at least as far as the world knew it at the time and the discourse

04:47:49.040 --> 04:47:54.160
[Guest]: around it was, it was a real picture of a mother who is an aged senior lady who's on

04:47:54.160 --> 04:47:59.040
[Guest]: an oxygen concentrator during COVID second wave where people are dying and oxygen are

04:47:59.040 --> 04:48:03.600
[Guest]: going low and woh concentrator laga ke she's standing in the kitchen making round rotis

04:48:03.600 --> 04:48:04.800
[Guest]: for her son.

04:48:04.800 --> 04:48:10.200
[Guest]: And this useless son who's presumably healthy and not hooked up to a cylinder is standing

04:48:10.200 --> 04:48:13.880
[Guest]: in the kitchen and instead of taking over from his mother is taking her photo and uploads

04:48:13.880 --> 04:48:18.640
[Guest]: it on social media saying ki yeh hoti hai maa, yeh hoti hai sachhi maa.

04:48:18.640 --> 04:48:23.760
[Guest]: And that's what drew so much flak and I'm glad we live in a time where it draws flak

04:48:23.760 --> 04:48:26.120
[Guest]: and people are forced to reconsider these things.

04:48:26.120 --> 04:48:31.560
[Guest]: But that's the trope of Mother India and you know, I mean, I used to, I still joke that

04:48:31.560 --> 04:48:35.360
[Guest]: you know Mother's Day should be called Happy Martyrs Day because we just love turning our

04:48:35.360 --> 04:48:40.440
[Guest]: mothers into martyrs ki unhone maar le itna kuch kiya, unhone maar le sabko chhod diya.

04:48:40.440 --> 04:48:45.880
[Guest]: And even today on Women's Day and all you'll see LinkedIn pe these professionally accomplished

04:48:45.880 --> 04:48:50.200
[Guest]: men are putting up posts of I want to take this day to thank my wife.

04:48:50.200 --> 04:48:55.280
[Guest]: She gave up her career and raised our child and I went out and she wanted to work but

04:48:55.280 --> 04:48:57.320
[Guest]: she couldn't work because she supported my career.

04:48:57.320 --> 04:48:58.320
[Guest]: Like shame on you.

04:48:58.320 --> 04:49:00.760
[Guest]: This is not something to be proud of.

04:49:00.760 --> 04:49:06.040
[Guest]: You killed your wife's dreams and then you're now showing it off and tumhara ek social media

04:49:06.040 --> 04:49:08.920
[Amit Varma]: post likhne se ho gaya, ho gaya kya uska compensation ne.

04:49:08.920 --> 04:49:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Tu toh proud hai apne wife ka, why don't you ask her if she's proud of you.

04:49:12.040 --> 04:49:13.040
[Guest]: Exactly, yeah.

04:49:13.040 --> 04:49:15.920
[Guest]: Let's, let's hear the other side also.

04:49:15.920 --> 04:49:19.560
[Guest]: So I mean that's, that's my problem with it and I think in the beginning also I used the

04:49:19.560 --> 04:49:23.440
[Guest]: word celebrated and I said no we should, celebrate is the wrong word, we should say acknowledged

04:49:23.440 --> 04:49:28.080
[Guest]: because women doing everything is not something to be celebrated, it's something for us to

04:49:28.080 --> 04:49:30.320
[Guest]: be ashamed of as a society.

04:49:30.320 --> 04:49:35.440
[Guest]: That we are forcing our women to do cooking, cleaning, ghar ka samaan, bahar ka, fir office

04:49:35.440 --> 04:49:40.600
[Guest]: bhi jao, woh bhi sambhalo aur uske baad wahan pe boys club se bhi maar khao, idhar ghar

04:49:40.600 --> 04:49:45.480
[Guest]: pe patiks ke liye bhi rotiya gol banao, toh I mean if we are truly putting this much burden

04:49:45.480 --> 04:49:49.360
[Guest]: on women that every Mother's Day you see or every Women's Day you see that woman with

04:49:49.360 --> 04:49:53.040
[Guest]: eight hands, ek haath mein tawa, ek haath mein bachcha, ek haath mein laptop, ek haath

04:49:53.040 --> 04:49:59.800
[Guest]: mein press ironing, toh woh image jo hai that's a matter of shame and I feel that's what the

04:49:59.800 --> 04:50:04.160
[Guest]: women also who I interviewed for this piece were echoing.

04:50:04.160 --> 04:50:09.920
[Guest]: One of them said that someone put up in her office, put up a thing outside her door, superwoman

04:50:09.920 --> 04:50:14.760
[Guest]: because she was a working mother of two and blah blah blah, so she was like ye hatao,

04:50:14.760 --> 04:50:20.720
[Guest]: I don't want to be a superwoman, let me be just a woman, I want to be human, it's a privilege,

04:50:20.720 --> 04:50:25.240
[Guest]: it's my right to be left alone to be human and you are not giving me that right, you

04:50:25.240 --> 04:50:29.760
[Guest]: are forcing this superwoman down my throat, not just the person who's put up the board,

04:50:29.760 --> 04:50:35.280
[Guest]: society, family, everyone and by raising me, holding me to these high standards, you are

04:50:35.280 --> 04:50:39.040
[Guest]: getting away with murder, you are getting away with not caregiving for your children,

04:50:39.040 --> 04:50:44.800
[Guest]: taking care of your house and pulling your weight at either the workplace or at home

04:50:44.800 --> 04:50:50.720
[Guest]: and so don't make us super, we are quite happy being human and let us just be human, that's

04:50:50.720 --> 04:50:55.600
[Guest]: basically what the entire movement is about, let women be human.

04:50:55.600 --> 04:51:01.680
[Amit Varma]: Abhi toh Salman Khan aa jaayega aapka newsletter ki sponsorship karne, because being human

04:51:01.680 --> 04:51:03.000
[Guest]: ke saath toh jaata hi hai.

04:51:03.000 --> 04:51:06.680
[Guest]: I'm happy to wear his t-shirt, junko hi nahi kehta sponsorship.

04:51:06.680 --> 04:51:09.200
[Amit Varma]: There's a larger question.

04:51:09.200 --> 04:51:13.360
[Amit Varma]: In the same post about fabulous lives of Indian housewives, you quote someone called Meeta

04:51:13.360 --> 04:51:18.400
[Amit Varma]: who is separated from her husband and you quote her as saying, quote, I have never slept

04:51:18.400 --> 04:51:20.120
[Amit Varma]: better in my life, right?

04:51:20.120 --> 04:51:24.640
[Amit Varma]: Elsewhere, you talk about how divorces are going up and I think 12 years or 13 years

04:51:24.640 --> 04:51:29.320
[Amit Varma]: ago, I'd got a bit of flack when I wrote a column saying that rising divorce rates in

04:51:29.320 --> 04:51:31.160
[Amit Varma]: India is something we should celebrate.

04:51:31.160 --> 04:51:35.800
[Amit Varma]: It means that more and more women are being empowered to get out of toxic marriages, right?

04:51:35.800 --> 04:51:39.960
[Amit Varma]: You've also written posts, like there's one post called the Great Indian Dhakosla.

04:51:39.960 --> 04:51:44.160
[Amit Varma]: You've written a very powerful post on domestic violence as well.

04:51:44.160 --> 04:51:50.280
[Amit Varma]: And this leads me to this larger sort of question about the institution of marriage itself.

04:51:50.280 --> 04:51:57.760
[Amit Varma]: I think that the way the institution of marriage is conceived, that conception is toxic, right?

04:51:57.760 --> 04:52:03.000
[Amit Varma]: Because men and women are kind of fixed in their roles in a way that you have, you know,

04:52:03.000 --> 04:52:09.000
[Amit Varma]: outlined here, how men are the Raja betas and women are fixed and trapped and imprisoned

04:52:09.000 --> 04:52:15.520
[Amit Varma]: in models of lives, which completely destroy them, like, you know, their lives are just

04:52:15.520 --> 04:52:20.480
[Amit Varma]: taken away from them by these roles that they're force fitted into.

04:52:20.480 --> 04:52:24.960
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just thinking that and my point is not at all that people should not get married.

04:52:24.960 --> 04:52:26.800
[Amit Varma]: I've already said people shouldn't have kids.

04:52:26.800 --> 04:52:31.000
[Amit Varma]: My point is not at all that people don't get married, marriage can be beautiful when you

04:52:31.000 --> 04:52:33.960
[Amit Varma]: marry someone who's your friend, you've got companionship.

04:52:33.960 --> 04:52:37.400
[Amit Varma]: If you choose to have a family together, there's lots that beautiful about it.

04:52:37.400 --> 04:52:45.520
[Amit Varma]: But the conception of marriage as it is today, seems to me to be toxic and one sidedly toxic.

04:52:45.520 --> 04:52:50.040
[Amit Varma]: I think it also in a small way harms men by trapping them in these stereotypes, which

04:52:50.040 --> 04:52:57.080
[Amit Varma]: can hurt them also, but it is almost completely one sidedly toxic, it destroys women's lives,

04:52:57.080 --> 04:52:58.080
[Amit Varma]: right?

04:52:58.080 --> 04:53:03.160
[Amit Varma]: So, do you think in a thought experiment, as society keeps changing over decades and

04:53:03.160 --> 04:53:08.560
[Amit Varma]: perhaps centuries, that this institution will appear unnecessary?

04:53:08.560 --> 04:53:14.880
[Amit Varma]: That it can become possible for men and women to associate with each other to have the kind

04:53:14.880 --> 04:53:19.480
[Amit Varma]: of relationships they want to have with each other by mutual consent with agreed upon roles

04:53:19.480 --> 04:53:26.480
[Amit Varma]: and demarcations without this actual institution and all the negativity that it carries?

04:53:26.480 --> 04:53:32.720
[Guest]: So, I wrote this post in February of this year, which I celebrated as Valentine's month

04:53:32.720 --> 04:53:37.700
[Guest]: and for weeks I wrote four posts about dating and different stages of life, different modes

04:53:37.700 --> 04:53:38.920
[Guest]: of dating.

04:53:38.920 --> 04:53:42.240
[Guest]: One of them was about dating in your 40s, 50s and 60s.

04:53:42.240 --> 04:53:46.400
[Guest]: And that is the one that I love the most.

04:53:46.400 --> 04:53:52.120
[Guest]: I think the biggest scam in society today is that women are, young women and girls are

04:53:52.120 --> 04:53:55.800
[Guest]: conditioned to see marriage as an achievement or a trophy.

04:53:55.800 --> 04:54:00.320
[Guest]: And so you'll have these tropes and based on reality, that the woman is chasing the

04:54:00.320 --> 04:54:06.520
[Guest]: man for proposing and the man is like commitment phobic and running away from it.

04:54:06.520 --> 04:54:13.960
[Guest]: I've had that experience myself, plenty of commitment phobic men, but it's now in hindsight

04:54:13.960 --> 04:54:20.020
[Guest]: I'm like, what is wrong with us for chasing this institution, which is so disadvantageous

04:54:20.020 --> 04:54:23.360
[Guest]: to us, like you said, unidirectionally toxic, right?

04:54:23.360 --> 04:54:27.520
[Guest]: So I mean, it makes, and there's a lot of research there about it, about how married

04:54:27.520 --> 04:54:30.640
[Guest]: women have a shorter lifespan than unmarried women.

04:54:30.640 --> 04:54:33.240
[Guest]: Married men have a longer lifespan than unmarried men.

04:54:33.240 --> 04:54:38.760
[Guest]: So it's obvious who the institution of marriage is benefiting more in terms of happiness,

04:54:38.760 --> 04:54:42.420
[Guest]: longevity, health, all dimensions.

04:54:42.420 --> 04:54:45.800
[Guest]: It's obvious that marriage is better for men than it is for women.

04:54:45.800 --> 04:54:49.640
[Guest]: And so the trope should be that men should be chasing women around the street, that please

04:54:49.640 --> 04:54:50.640
[Amit Varma]: marry me.

04:54:50.640 --> 04:54:53.640
[Guest]: But they do, they do, that's also a problem.

04:54:53.640 --> 04:54:59.120
[Guest]: That's a whole other problem, but I'm saying between consensual relationships, one common

04:54:59.120 --> 04:55:04.120
[Guest]: trope is that women should marry and men shouldn't, at least in the young age.

04:55:04.120 --> 04:55:10.000
[Guest]: That's why I love that post about dating in your 40s, 50s, 60s, because so one very interesting

04:55:10.000 --> 04:55:15.320
[Guest]: and my favorite, one of my favorite insights that I got interviewing women who are dating

04:55:15.320 --> 04:55:20.240
[Guest]: at that age was that by this age, most of us have had one marriage at least, right?

04:55:20.240 --> 04:55:25.080
[Guest]: So the men are also divorced or widowed, women are also divorced or widowed, only few are

04:55:25.080 --> 04:55:26.800
[Guest]: single at that age.

04:55:26.800 --> 04:55:33.520
[Guest]: So after having had one experience of marriage, all the women have figured out, this is not

04:55:33.520 --> 04:55:39.120
[Guest]: a trap I want to fall into, mujhe nahi firse kisi ki mummy banna, like that's what Indian

04:55:39.120 --> 04:55:43.720
[Guest]: men are looking for in their wives is mummy, toh mujhe nahi banna apne partner ki mummy.

04:55:43.720 --> 04:55:48.520
[Guest]: So she said that at this stage of life, and the reverse has happened for the men because

04:55:48.520 --> 04:55:53.960
[Guest]: they realized how comfortable and luxurious their life was when they had this person doing

04:55:53.960 --> 04:55:58.160
[Guest]: invisible caregiving work for their family and them.

04:55:58.160 --> 04:56:02.800
[Guest]: And somewhere in the background, magically chai ke cups are being produced and food is

04:56:02.800 --> 04:56:06.440
[Guest]: appearing on the table and you don't have to worry about kichan mein chawal khatam because

04:56:06.440 --> 04:56:09.520
[Guest]: somebody else is thinking about it all the time.

04:56:09.520 --> 04:56:13.800
[Guest]: So men have figured out the comforts of marriage and women have figured out the traps of it.

04:56:13.800 --> 04:56:18.760
[Guest]: And so at that age, she told me that it's oolta, like every man I date is looking to

04:56:18.760 --> 04:56:23.240
[Guest]: set, so quote unquote settle down and wants to immediately get married.

04:56:23.240 --> 04:56:26.680
[Guest]: And women are like, sorry, casual.

04:56:26.680 --> 04:56:27.680
[Guest]: So it's amazing.

04:56:27.680 --> 04:56:28.680
[Guest]: I loved it.

04:56:28.680 --> 04:56:34.480
[Guest]: That at least now, slowly, even after having had a bad experience, at least at some stage

04:56:34.480 --> 04:56:40.560
[Guest]: and age, you are, we are all becoming conscious of this and the right gender is chasing that

04:56:40.560 --> 04:56:44.680
[Guest]: institution and the right one is running away from it finally.

04:56:44.680 --> 04:56:45.680
[Amit Varma]: That's a great insight.

04:56:45.680 --> 04:56:50.280
[Amit Varma]: And I hope some of these older women can act as a cool aunt for their younger nieces and

04:56:50.280 --> 04:56:55.400
[Amit Varma]: so on and tell them ki bachho, just chill, koi jaldi nahi hai.

04:56:55.400 --> 04:56:56.400
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

04:56:56.400 --> 04:56:59.840
[Amit Varma]: Let's, let's, you know, talk about like, like we've spoken in the context of offices and

04:56:59.840 --> 04:57:06.240
[Amit Varma]: air conditioners and toilets, how the world is sort of designed by men for men, and so

04:57:06.240 --> 04:57:07.360
[Amit Varma]: on and so forth.

04:57:07.360 --> 04:57:14.440
[Amit Varma]: And another instance of this is the health of women, like at one point, you talk about

04:57:14.440 --> 04:57:20.640
[Amit Varma]: how women are often blindsided by biology, you know, you talk about the problems of menstruation,

04:57:20.640 --> 04:57:25.500
[Amit Varma]: but I was struck by this quote here, where you write, quote, according to the Guardian,

04:57:25.500 --> 04:57:30.040
[Amit Varma]: in the UK, and this is a Guardian's words in the UK, less than 2.5% of publicly funded

04:57:30.040 --> 04:57:34.800
[Amit Varma]: research is dedicated solely to reproductive health, despite the fact that one in three

04:57:34.800 --> 04:57:39.960
[Amit Varma]: women suffers from a reproductive or gynecological, gynecological, sorry, my pronunciations are

04:57:39.960 --> 04:57:45.400
[Amit Varma]: bad health problem, that there is five times more research into erectile dysfunction, which

04:57:45.400 --> 04:57:52.000
[Amit Varma]: affects 19% of men than into premenstrual syndrome, which affects 90% of men, stop code,

04:57:52.000 --> 04:57:53.000
[Amit Varma]: right.

04:57:53.000 --> 04:57:57.080
[Amit Varma]: And you also pointed out about how, you know, there'll be so much more research into say

04:57:57.080 --> 04:58:01.400
[Amit Varma]: type two diabetes, because, you know, men also have it as opposed to something like

04:58:01.400 --> 04:58:02.400
[Amit Varma]: PCOS.

04:58:02.400 --> 04:58:03.400
[Amit Varma]: Right.

04:58:03.400 --> 04:58:10.800
[Amit Varma]: So sort of tell me a little bit about this, therefore, and also specifically about how

04:58:10.800 --> 04:58:15.040
[Amit Varma]: menstruation isn't taken seriously enough, especially by men who just, you know, who

04:58:15.040 --> 04:58:18.760
[Amit Varma]: will brush it off and say, oh, it's that time of the month again, or she's PMSing again,

04:58:18.760 --> 04:58:19.760
[Amit Varma]: or whatever.

04:58:19.760 --> 04:58:26.160
[Amit Varma]: But for women, it is such a huge issue that impacts their life in such a big way.

04:58:26.160 --> 04:58:27.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:58:27.160 --> 04:58:32.160
[Guest]: So I had this friend, a flatmate I used to live with when I first moved to Bombay, and

04:58:32.160 --> 04:58:38.200
[Guest]: she used to have very, very painful periods, like, I was fortunate enough that periods

04:58:38.200 --> 04:58:42.560
[Guest]: for everyone there, there is discomfort, but it was not like crippling.

04:58:42.560 --> 04:58:46.400
[Guest]: For her, it was, she had to take two months, two days off a month.

04:58:46.400 --> 04:58:48.680
[Guest]: And that was basically the extent of on leave we got.

04:58:48.680 --> 04:58:53.540
[Guest]: So every month, her on leave would go for this, because she would literally be bound

04:58:53.540 --> 04:58:57.560
[Guest]: on the bed, and I would often come home to see her crying.

04:58:57.560 --> 04:59:00.360
[Guest]: And once or twice she told me, and we used to live on the 11th floor, and she told me

04:59:00.360 --> 04:59:05.000
[Guest]: I want to throw myself off out of this window to just to end this misery.

04:59:05.000 --> 04:59:10.800
[Guest]: And I was, I was, I would be genuinely very scared for her and her safety, her health.

04:59:10.800 --> 04:59:15.400
[Guest]: And I have so many times we've discussed, we should see a doctor.

04:59:15.400 --> 04:59:23.160
[Guest]: And no doctor was able to say anything, that's basically the response she would get.

04:59:23.160 --> 04:59:25.720
[Guest]: Some would say, that will solve it.

04:59:25.720 --> 04:59:27.960
[Guest]: Today, she has a kid and it hasn't solved it.

04:59:27.960 --> 04:59:29.800
[Guest]: So by the way.

04:59:29.800 --> 04:59:36.800
[Guest]: So and much later in life, I came across a post about, I think it's called endometriosis,

04:59:36.800 --> 04:59:43.360
[Guest]: which is that menstruation cycle is the endometrial wall shedding itself.

04:59:43.360 --> 04:59:48.600
[Guest]: And that process of that shedding is sometimes exceptionally painful.

04:59:48.600 --> 04:59:52.760
[Guest]: And it's like a pain that most people will not be able to tolerate.

04:59:52.760 --> 04:59:55.680
[Guest]: I mean, it's very high grade pain.

04:59:55.680 --> 05:00:01.680
[Guest]: And people are, women are not only going through it, but they are coming to work, doing, working

05:00:01.680 --> 05:00:09.400
[Guest]: alongside men, performing equally well, sometimes better than them, while bearing that pain.

05:00:09.400 --> 05:00:13.200
[Guest]: And there is nothing that the medical science is doing to address it.

05:00:13.200 --> 05:00:18.200
[Guest]: So endometriosis is one of the many conditions, like you said, polycystic ovarian syndrome,

05:00:18.200 --> 05:00:22.840
[Guest]: endometriosis, most types of cancers that affect only women.

05:00:22.840 --> 05:00:26.440
[Guest]: All of this is like very, very exceptionally poorly funded.

05:00:26.440 --> 05:00:30.120
[Guest]: So even when the COVID vaccine came out, I went for the vaccine and they asked me, are

05:00:30.120 --> 05:00:31.440
[Guest]: you still feeding your baby?

05:00:31.440 --> 05:00:34.000
[Guest]: And I wasn't at the time, so I could get the vaccine.

05:00:34.000 --> 05:00:37.760
[Guest]: But if you were feeding your child, just the jury is out.

05:00:37.760 --> 05:00:38.760
[Guest]: We don't know.

05:00:38.760 --> 05:00:39.760
[Guest]: Can you take it or not?

05:00:39.760 --> 05:00:40.760
[Guest]: We don't know.

05:00:40.760 --> 05:00:46.360
[Guest]: Pregnant women can't take it and lactating women also can't, we won't suggest it.

05:00:46.360 --> 05:00:47.360
[Guest]: Why?

05:00:47.360 --> 05:00:48.800
[Guest]: Because you have not done any research on it.

05:00:48.800 --> 05:00:55.640
[Guest]: So COVID vaccine was made in a very crunch situation, but almost all, almost completely

05:00:55.640 --> 05:01:00.320
[Guest]: all of medical science is tuned towards the needs of men, even when it is recreational

05:01:00.320 --> 05:01:07.400
[Guest]: needs like erectile dysfunction, not to diminish what kind of condition that must be, but again,

05:01:07.400 --> 05:01:08.400
[Guest]: it's just about numbers.

05:01:08.400 --> 05:01:09.400
[Amit Varma]: 19% versus 90%.

05:01:09.400 --> 05:01:10.400
[Amit Varma]: Correct.

05:01:10.400 --> 05:01:16.760
[Guest]: So 90%, like almost every woman you'll talk to has a story about PMS, which is painful,

05:01:16.760 --> 05:01:22.640
[Guest]: which is debilitating and I don't know how many men will even admit to it, but that's

05:01:22.640 --> 05:01:24.640
[Guest]: not a very common condition.

05:01:24.640 --> 05:01:29.200
[Guest]: So there is this definite big gap in just medical funding.

05:01:29.200 --> 05:01:34.920
[Guest]: The second thing that I want to talk about and I've written a couple of pieces about

05:01:34.920 --> 05:01:39.240
[Guest]: it is also the medical response, the response of the medical community to women, women's

05:01:39.240 --> 05:01:41.560
[Guest]: pain and women's needs.

05:01:41.560 --> 05:01:49.680
[Guest]: So I've written a piece about how the men are seen as, you know, brave and putting up

05:01:49.680 --> 05:01:52.440
[Guest]: a brave face where women are hysterical.

05:01:52.440 --> 05:01:56.440
[Guest]: So brave men and hysterical women, that's the name of the piece that when a man says,

05:01:56.440 --> 05:02:00.360
[Guest]: I'm in pain, this man is so brave, he's tolerating the pain.

05:02:00.360 --> 05:02:05.840
[Guest]: And when a woman says, I'm in pain, she's hysterical, she just has a low pain threshold.

05:02:05.840 --> 05:02:11.520
[Guest]: Whereas the fact is that women will go through pain, which is often much worse than anything

05:02:11.520 --> 05:02:12.800
[Guest]: men will ever experience.

05:02:12.800 --> 05:02:18.600
[Guest]: So like the pain of delivery, for instance, is worse than the pain of losing a limb.

05:02:18.600 --> 05:02:24.400
[Guest]: So if I chopped off a person's arm, it would hurt them less than it hurts to deliver a

05:02:24.400 --> 05:02:25.400
[Guest]: baby.

05:02:25.400 --> 05:02:29.520
[Guest]: And almost every woman does it in her life, or at least everyone who's having a vaginal

05:02:29.520 --> 05:02:30.960
[Guest]: birth will do it.

05:02:30.960 --> 05:02:35.960
[Guest]: And so there is not enough pain relief for women.

05:02:35.960 --> 05:02:39.600
[Guest]: In fact, I've written a piece on obstetric violence, which is just horrifying stuff that

05:02:39.600 --> 05:02:42.920
[Guest]: is done to women who are during labor.

05:02:42.920 --> 05:02:47.120
[Guest]: My friend who's a doctor, she told me that in districts, in hospitals, they used to lay

05:02:47.120 --> 05:02:49.800
[Guest]: four women on a steel bed at a time, so that they get hurt.

05:02:49.800 --> 05:02:54.000
[Guest]: They'll just strip off their clothes and in that indignified position, they'll say, okay,

05:02:54.000 --> 05:02:55.160
[Guest]: start pushing.

05:02:55.160 --> 05:03:00.640
[Guest]: And my friend, she said, I was doing an episiotomy, which is a scary thing that is done during

05:03:00.640 --> 05:03:01.640
[Guest]: labor.

05:03:01.640 --> 05:03:05.000
[Guest]: And she said that I was giving her anesthesia because it's a cut you have to put in the

05:03:05.000 --> 05:03:06.000
[Guest]: vagina.

05:03:06.000 --> 05:03:09.040
[Guest]: And she said, before cutting, I was giving her an anesthesia injection, and the nurse

05:03:09.040 --> 05:03:12.240
[Guest]: came and said, ma'am, why are you wasting the injection on her, she's already in pain,

05:03:12.240 --> 05:03:13.840
[Guest]: let it be a little more.

05:03:13.840 --> 05:03:19.240
[Guest]: And I've spoken to women who have been, a friend of mine, she was a nurse practitioner,

05:03:19.240 --> 05:03:27.560
[Guest]: and she said that, I've seen women being slapped during labor, that why are you yelling, slapping.

05:03:27.560 --> 05:03:32.720
[Guest]: We were slut-shamed during her labor, that it was a lot of fun having sex, now we know

05:03:32.720 --> 05:03:33.720
[Guest]: how painful it is.

05:03:33.720 --> 05:03:37.720
[Guest]: So, you know, things like this, it's inhuman, it's unimaginable that this is the way we

05:03:37.720 --> 05:03:43.880
[Guest]: are treating women for, our mothers, our sisters, whom we respect so much in our speeches, when

05:03:43.880 --> 05:03:49.120
[Guest]: they are becoming mothers, at that time, we treat her like, like vermin.

05:03:49.120 --> 05:03:52.160
[Guest]: There is, there are stories now, and in India, it is not as well documented.

05:03:52.160 --> 05:03:57.280
[Guest]: I've read papers about it in the US, where there is better documentation of it, or for

05:03:57.280 --> 05:04:01.200
[Guest]: example, there was a doctor who tied a woman's legs together, so she couldn't deliver a baby,

05:04:01.200 --> 05:04:06.000
[Guest]: so he could go take his lunch break, okay, I want to have a quick lunch, just so she

05:04:06.000 --> 05:04:08.240
[Guest]: doesn't deliver while I'm away, tie her legs together.

05:04:08.240 --> 05:04:14.240
[Guest]: So I mean, it's just, it's criminal, inhuman, animals would not behave like this, I mean,

05:04:14.240 --> 05:04:17.800
[Guest]: I don't want to insult animals by calling this animalistic behavior.

05:04:17.800 --> 05:04:23.280
[Guest]: So it's, that's the kind of caregiving that we give to women, and I was, I myself had

05:04:23.280 --> 05:04:29.400
[Guest]: a very, very difficult birth because of the, because my caregiver, my, my doctor saw me

05:04:29.400 --> 05:04:32.080
[Guest]: as a baby-carrying vessel, like I've written.

05:04:32.080 --> 05:04:36.560
[Guest]: So it was, ke, ha tumko yeh dard ho raha hai, yeh problem hai, ha toh yeh toh hoga hi na,

05:04:36.560 --> 05:04:39.720
[Guest]: bachcha peda karna hai toh yeh sab nahi, jhelogi kya, jao jhelo.

05:04:39.720 --> 05:04:43.760
[Guest]: And so, I mean, the standing joke between many moms is that, if men were supposed to

05:04:43.760 --> 05:04:49.000
[Guest]: give birth, or have periods, we would have five-star lounges all over the place, ki jao,

05:04:49.000 --> 05:04:53.280
[Guest]: kahan jaake paanch din check-in karlo, aur aaraam se period karke aa jaana, like that,

05:04:53.280 --> 05:04:56.920
[Guest]: those are the facilities we would provide if men were going through these things.

05:04:56.920 --> 05:05:02.840
[Guest]: But because it is women going through them, we are treated as, just, I mean, as, as vermin,

05:05:02.840 --> 05:05:06.320
[Guest]: like I said, ke, mein tab kuch fark hi nahi pad raha hai tumhari, your, your suffering

05:05:06.320 --> 05:05:10.200
[Guest]: is, is meaningless to us, and in fact, it's well-deserved because you're a woman, and

05:05:10.200 --> 05:05:12.440
[Guest]: this is your lot.

05:05:12.440 --> 05:05:15.960
[Amit Varma]: And not just these contexts, other contexts, like in that post-braveman and hysterical

05:05:15.960 --> 05:05:20.760
[Amit Varma]: woman you quote, someone called Shefali, talking about what happened to her after an operation,

05:05:20.760 --> 05:05:25.040
[Amit Varma]: where she says, quote, it was a complicated surgery and I suffered from extreme headaches

05:05:25.040 --> 05:05:26.040
[Amit Varma]: during recovery.

05:05:26.040 --> 05:05:30.400
[Amit Varma]: When I told my neurologist to give me something for the pain, she addressed my parents instead

05:05:30.400 --> 05:05:31.400
[Amit Varma]: of me.

05:05:31.400 --> 05:05:32.840
[Amit Varma]: Tell your daughter she has to bear children.

05:05:32.840 --> 05:05:34.560
[Amit Varma]: What is this pain in comparison?

05:05:34.560 --> 05:05:39.120
[Amit Varma]: We later discovered that my brain had actual swelling post-surgery, which caused the severe

05:05:39.120 --> 05:05:40.120
[Amit Varma]: headaches.

05:05:40.120 --> 05:05:44.200
[Amit Varma]: I kept begging for painkillers, but my own doctor made light of the pain, stop quote,

05:05:44.200 --> 05:05:48.760
[Amit Varma]: and I was struck that that neurologist is a she, you know, still, there is this sort

05:05:48.760 --> 05:05:54.640
[Amit Varma]: of this way of thinking that women's pain doesn't matter, and it's, you know, so on

05:05:54.640 --> 05:05:55.640
[Amit Varma]: and so forth.

05:05:55.640 --> 05:06:01.320
[Amit Varma]: And, and I absolutely love this quote in your earlier post on menstruation as well.

05:06:01.320 --> 05:06:05.760
[Amit Varma]: You've quoted Melissa McKeown, you know, and people keep joking about PMS, for example,

05:06:05.760 --> 05:06:07.120
[Unknown]: and how women behave and all that.

05:06:07.120 --> 05:06:10.840
[Amit Varma]: And there's this lovely quote by Melissa McKeown, I'll read out quote, let's put this shit to

05:06:10.840 --> 05:06:12.120
[Amit Varma]: bed right now.

05:06:12.120 --> 05:06:16.100
[Amit Varma]: Women don't lose their minds when they have period related irritability.

05:06:16.100 --> 05:06:21.000
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't lower their ability to reason, it lowers their patience, and hence tolerance

05:06:21.000 --> 05:06:22.000
[Amit Varma]: for bullshit.

05:06:22.000 --> 05:06:25.760
[Amit Varma]: If an issue comes up a lot during that time of the month, that doesn't mean she only cares

05:06:25.760 --> 05:06:27.100
[Amit Varma]: about it once a month.

05:06:27.100 --> 05:06:31.280
[Amit Varma]: It means she's bothered by it all the time, and lacks the capacity once a month to shove

05:06:31.280 --> 05:06:36.600
[Amit Varma]: it down and bury it beneath six gulps of willful silence, stop quote.

05:06:36.600 --> 05:06:44.040
[Amit Varma]: And so sort of expressive there, let's, let's talk about safety, for example, you know,

05:06:44.040 --> 05:06:50.520
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, earlier, I had, you know, quoted Natasha, who you spoke to in your post about

05:06:50.520 --> 05:06:54.360
[Amit Varma]: should we lock up all the women, where she spoke about the paranoia, or what men would

05:06:54.360 --> 05:06:57.880
[Amit Varma]: call paranoia that every time she enters a public space, she's looking, she's making

05:06:57.880 --> 05:07:01.360
[Amit Varma]: sure where is the exit route, where can I escape?

05:07:01.360 --> 05:07:03.560
[Amit Varma]: What do I have to defend myself with?

05:07:03.560 --> 05:07:09.720
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, you write, quote, no matter who the fault lies with, it is a woman's freedom

05:07:09.720 --> 05:07:11.120
[Amit Varma]: that gets curtailed.

05:07:11.120 --> 05:07:15.600
[Amit Varma]: And that has conditioned us to be wary to the point of paranoia, stop quote.

05:07:15.600 --> 05:07:18.240
[Amit Varma]: And Kavita Krishnan wrote a great book called Fearless Freedom about this.

05:07:18.240 --> 05:07:20.320
[Amit Varma]: She was on my show as well.

05:07:20.320 --> 05:07:22.060
[Amit Varma]: And here's the thing.

05:07:22.060 --> 05:07:27.280
[Amit Varma]: And I'm going to circle back to something that you mentioned about your engineering

05:07:27.280 --> 05:07:35.320
[Amit Varma]: college in Kurukshetra, right, that women weren't supposed to go out, if 4.30 classes

05:07:35.320 --> 05:07:40.760
[Amit Varma]: are over, you have to stay in the hostel till 5.30, you know, you managed to fashion out

05:07:40.760 --> 05:07:45.680
[Amit Varma]: of thin air and aunt in Karnal, but otherwise, that's generally where you're stuck.

05:07:45.680 --> 05:07:48.680
[Amit Varma]: And I was chatting with Alice Evans yesterday.

05:07:48.680 --> 05:07:51.640
[Amit Varma]: And I don't know, and she's, of course, a researcher on gender.

05:07:51.640 --> 05:07:55.320
[Amit Varma]: And I don't know whether this episode will come before that or what the order will be.

05:07:55.320 --> 05:08:02.960
[Amit Varma]: But she pointed to what she calls an honor income trade off, right, where she's looking

05:08:02.960 --> 05:08:07.360
[Amit Varma]: into the question of why don't more women work in the subcontinent that question gets

05:08:07.360 --> 05:08:12.200
[Amit Varma]: complicated, elsewhere in the world, if your economic opportunities go up for women, and

05:08:12.200 --> 05:08:15.160
[Amit Varma]: the incentives go in that direction, then more women can work.

05:08:15.160 --> 05:08:20.160
[Amit Varma]: But over here, there is an honor, income trade off, in the sense that it is not only the

05:08:20.160 --> 05:08:25.240
[Amit Varma]: income, there is a drive towards female seclusion, that families believe that their honor can

05:08:25.240 --> 05:08:29.600
[Amit Varma]: get sullied if the woman goes out, because she could get abducted or raped or have an

05:08:29.600 --> 05:08:31.100
[Amit Varma]: affair or whatever.

05:08:31.100 --> 05:08:34.880
[Amit Varma]: And to protect their honor, that they have this drive towards female seclusion.

05:08:34.880 --> 05:08:40.240
[Amit Varma]: And Alice was pointing to this study by two fine economists whom I also bumped into recently

05:08:40.240 --> 05:08:44.440
[Amit Varma]: at a conference with Vidya Mahambre and Soumya Dhanraj.

05:08:44.440 --> 05:08:45.600
[Amit Varma]: And Alice told me about this.

05:08:45.600 --> 05:08:46.600
[Amit Varma]: So this is secondhand.

05:08:46.600 --> 05:08:50.240
[Amit Varma]: I haven't read that study myself yet, because the recording just happened yesterday.

05:08:50.240 --> 05:08:56.400
[Amit Varma]: But the study apparently talks about this factory, which employs women, but which kind

05:08:56.400 --> 05:09:02.160
[Amit Varma]: of herds them to the factory in a very protective sort of environment, there are strict timings,

05:09:02.160 --> 05:09:04.840
[Amit Varma]: and then it deposits them back safely at home.

05:09:04.840 --> 05:09:09.360
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, this is supposed to be a feature, not a bug, because in the families of those

05:09:09.360 --> 05:09:12.640
[Amit Varma]: women can feel safe, ki theek hai kuch nahi hoga.

05:09:12.640 --> 05:09:17.200
[Amit Varma]: So the urge to female seclusion, therefore, doesn't become such a big factor.

05:09:17.200 --> 05:09:21.800
[Amit Varma]: And in that honor income trade off, the honor is less of a worry, because the factory is,

05:09:21.800 --> 05:09:26.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, taking the women in such a cloistered way in and out of the factory.

05:09:26.200 --> 05:09:29.560
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the income part plays more of a part in the women actually work.

05:09:29.560 --> 05:09:34.880
[Amit Varma]: Now, I was thinking, you know, this came to mind when you spoke of the hostel in Kurukshetra,

05:09:34.880 --> 05:09:40.040
[Amit Varma]: therefore, being able to tell the parents of young girls that your girls are safe here.

05:09:40.040 --> 05:09:44.640
[Amit Varma]: So on the one hand, I agree with you that the rule is deeply misogynistic, that the

05:09:44.640 --> 05:09:50.200
[Amit Varma]: men can lie around drinking in campus all night, but the women have to be there by 5.30.

05:09:50.200 --> 05:09:51.400
[Amit Varma]: Obviously misogynistic.

05:09:51.400 --> 05:09:55.880
[Amit Varma]: But the problem that it is solving for is also a misogynistic problem, the honor income

05:09:55.880 --> 05:09:59.680
[Amit Varma]: trade off for which many parents may say ki meri beti college nahi jaayegi.

05:09:59.680 --> 05:10:03.200
[Amit Varma]: But then if you tell her ki theek hai, aapke beti ko jaane do, wo safe hai, aise roles

05:10:03.200 --> 05:10:06.840
[Amit Varma]: hai, usko theek se rakhenge, and then they might agree.

05:10:06.840 --> 05:10:11.520
[Amit Varma]: And the larger point which I am therefore coming at is that I think sometimes what happens

05:10:11.520 --> 05:10:16.560
[Amit Varma]: is we see a problem, and we want a utopian solution where everything just disappears.

05:10:16.560 --> 05:10:23.200
[Amit Varma]: So the ideal world that I want to live in is where the rule of law is enforced, where

05:10:23.200 --> 05:10:27.320
[Amit Varma]: college authorities, police, they all do their job, women are safe, and men and women at

05:10:27.320 --> 05:10:31.120
[Amit Varma]: any point of night can go out and do whatever the hell they want.

05:10:31.120 --> 05:10:36.240
[Amit Varma]: But there would be an argument that you are not going to get there overnight, that there

05:10:36.240 --> 05:10:40.920
[Amit Varma]: are compromises and trade offs that you make on the way there.

05:10:40.920 --> 05:10:46.520
[Amit Varma]: So in isolation, something like this that seems misogynistic, is actually making the

05:10:46.520 --> 05:10:50.760
[Amit Varma]: other deeper problem, the honor income trade off, which has women cooped up at home, it's

05:10:50.760 --> 05:10:55.440
[Amit Varma]: actually helping in at least making baby steps towards progress.

05:10:55.440 --> 05:10:57.480
[Amit Varma]: So how do we think about this?

05:10:57.480 --> 05:11:01.280
[Amit Varma]: Because a lot of what we see in our society is regressive.

05:11:01.280 --> 05:11:05.840
[Amit Varma]: But is it also something we should do that we should look at the trend across time and

05:11:05.840 --> 05:11:07.640
[Amit Varma]: see if things are getting better.

05:11:07.640 --> 05:11:11.600
[Amit Varma]: So I'm kind of thinking aloud, because this thought was sparked off by what you mentioned

05:11:11.600 --> 05:11:14.400
[Amit Varma]: earlier there in my conversation with Alice yesterday.

05:11:14.400 --> 05:11:16.200
[Amit Varma]: But I think you get the drift.

05:11:16.200 --> 05:11:20.040
[Amit Varma]: And the drift and the broad question is, how should we think about progress?

05:11:20.040 --> 05:11:28.160
[Guest]: Utopian, the final stage of progress is that everyone is free to do whatever they want.

05:11:28.160 --> 05:11:31.400
[Guest]: You want to work, you work, you don't want to work, you sit at home, and applies to both

05:11:31.400 --> 05:11:36.120
[Guest]: men and women, as long as financially things are taken care of.

05:11:36.120 --> 05:11:38.720
[Guest]: So that's the end stage, of course.

05:11:38.720 --> 05:11:43.400
[Guest]: But I see the honor income trade off, and it reminded me of a story while you were talking

05:11:43.400 --> 05:11:50.360
[Guest]: about how this building, somebody, I know, guard was spreading a rumor, that here in

05:11:50.360 --> 05:11:55.520
[Guest]: this flat, this mother and daughter have come, and this mother gets her daughter to do business.

05:11:55.520 --> 05:11:59.100
[Guest]: And this man, the guard says, I see at night.

05:11:59.100 --> 05:12:03.960
[Guest]: And then people like, somebody questioned further, how do you know, what did you see?

05:12:03.960 --> 05:12:18.080
[Guest]: And then he was like, and then later they found out she was working at a call center,

05:12:18.080 --> 05:12:26.760
[Guest]: which has overnight work, but again, like you say, you know, the mindset is that family

05:12:26.760 --> 05:12:31.600
[Guest]: honor is being saluted because the girl is going out to work at night.

05:12:31.600 --> 05:12:36.280
[Guest]: And the other point about public safety that I have made in that piece that you're referring

05:12:36.280 --> 05:12:42.840
[Guest]: to, is also not so much about the end stage of streets are safe for everybody.

05:12:42.840 --> 05:12:47.880
[Guest]: It's also about while the streets are unsafe, who are we holding responsible for the mishaps

05:12:47.880 --> 05:12:51.200
[Guest]: that are going down, the crimes that are going down?

05:12:51.200 --> 05:12:55.320
[Guest]: Are we holding the perpetrators of those crime responsible or the victims?

05:12:55.320 --> 05:13:01.000
[Guest]: So, if a woman is getting assaulted on the street, are we asking her, itne baje kya kar

05:13:01.000 --> 05:13:06.160
[Guest]: nahi, yeh skirt ki length kitni thi, kya kaam karne gayi thi, padhai karne gayi thi, ke

05:13:06.160 --> 05:13:10.040
[Guest]: kisi friend se milne gayi thi, padhai karne is vulnerable, friend se milne is not.

05:13:10.040 --> 05:13:12.800
[Guest]: Pitchar dekhne gayi thi, then you deserved it totally.

05:13:12.800 --> 05:13:15.280
[Guest]: You know, if you were drunk, then you were asking for it.

05:13:15.280 --> 05:13:19.680
[Guest]: So that, that's basically the question that I have raised in that piece.

05:13:19.680 --> 05:13:24.840
[Guest]: And it's, the book that I've referred to, which we can also link is called Violator,

05:13:24.840 --> 05:13:29.760
[Guest]: which is a whole movement, not about let's make streets safer for women as much as even

05:13:29.760 --> 05:13:31.520
[Guest]: before that.

05:13:31.520 --> 05:13:37.040
[Guest]: Let's at least accept that on our unsafe street, women's are, it's unsafe for women, but the

05:13:37.040 --> 05:13:39.300
[Guest]: solution is not to lock up the women.

05:13:39.300 --> 05:13:42.840
[Guest]: It is to do something about that safety question.

05:13:42.840 --> 05:13:47.880
[Guest]: And if something happens, give women the right to make these quote unquote mistakes.

05:13:47.880 --> 05:13:52.960
[Guest]: You say that itne baje wahan jaana was a mistake because you got assaulted when you went there.

05:13:52.960 --> 05:13:54.860
[Guest]: First of all, she didn't make the mistake.

05:13:54.860 --> 05:13:56.360
[Guest]: He committed a crime.

05:13:56.360 --> 05:14:00.200
[Guest]: So let's get that clear first, because the headlines will always say woman raped in Noida

05:14:00.200 --> 05:14:01.200
[Guest]: at night.

05:14:01.200 --> 05:14:04.160
[Guest]: It will never say man raped woman in Noida at night.

05:14:04.160 --> 05:14:05.480
[Guest]: That's never the headline.

05:14:05.480 --> 05:14:10.640
[Guest]: So let's first turn the narrative around and hold the perpetrator responsible for the lack

05:14:10.640 --> 05:14:13.160
[Guest]: of safety and the crime.

05:14:13.160 --> 05:14:17.520
[Guest]: And second, let's allow women the right to make these quote unquote mistakes.

05:14:17.520 --> 05:14:22.080
[Guest]: Theek hai, jaao raat ko jaao, jaaha jaana hai jaao, jo pehna hai pehno.

05:14:22.080 --> 05:14:26.840
[Guest]: We are adults, you are making choices, keeping your own safety and your other parameters

05:14:26.840 --> 05:14:28.040
[Guest]: in mind.

05:14:28.040 --> 05:14:30.760
[Guest]: So let's at least give women the right to do that.

05:14:30.760 --> 05:14:35.960
[Guest]: If a man gets mugged at night, batua chori ho gaya, kisi ne bhusa maar diya, toh hum

05:14:35.960 --> 05:14:40.760
[Guest]: toh nahi kehate hai na, it's your fault, you should have not gone there.

05:14:40.760 --> 05:14:41.760
[Guest]: What were you wearing?

05:14:41.760 --> 05:14:42.760
[Guest]: What were you wearing?

05:14:42.760 --> 05:14:43.760
[Guest]: Yeah.

05:14:43.760 --> 05:14:44.760
[Guest]: Batua mein itte rupe the kyu?

05:14:44.760 --> 05:14:48.800
[Guest]: No one asks these questions to a man, but they'll say that area is unsafe, wahan ke

05:14:48.800 --> 05:14:54.680
[Guest]: ladko ne yeh kar diya, attack kar diya humare izzat daar samajh ke members ko.

05:14:54.680 --> 05:14:56.840
[Guest]: Then we'll be upset with the perpetrators.

05:14:56.840 --> 05:15:00.840
[Guest]: So why is it that we are upset with the victim when it's a crime against a woman?

05:15:00.840 --> 05:15:05.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you'd made a great post on this called the burden of language.

05:15:05.360 --> 05:15:12.000
[Amit Varma]: And the quote that I like to give to illustrate how language matters so much is by Jackson

05:15:12.000 --> 05:15:14.200
[Amit Varma]: Katz.

05:15:14.200 --> 05:15:18.760
[Amit Varma]: And what Katz had said was, quote, we talk about how many women were raped last year,

05:15:18.760 --> 05:15:20.440
[Amit Varma]: not about how many men raped women.

05:15:20.440 --> 05:15:24.160
[Amit Varma]: We talk about how many girls in the school district were harassed last year, not about

05:15:24.160 --> 05:15:26.160
[Amit Varma]: how many boys harassed girls.

05:15:26.160 --> 05:15:30.440
[Amit Varma]: We talk about how many teenage girls got pregnant in the state of Vermont last year, rather

05:15:30.440 --> 05:15:33.600
[Amit Varma]: than how many men and teenage boys got girls pregnant.

05:15:33.600 --> 05:15:38.000
[Amit Varma]: So you can see how the effect of this passive voice has a political effect.

05:15:38.000 --> 05:15:42.320
[Amit Varma]: It shifts the focus of men and boys and on to girls and women.

05:15:42.320 --> 05:15:44.600
[Amit Varma]: Even the term violence against women is problematic.

05:15:44.600 --> 05:15:46.120
[Amit Varma]: It's a passive construction.

05:15:46.120 --> 05:15:48.000
[Amit Varma]: There's no active agent in the sentence.

05:15:48.000 --> 05:15:49.980
[Amit Varma]: It's a bad thing that happens to women.

05:15:49.980 --> 05:15:51.840
[Amit Varma]: It's a bad thing that happens to women.

05:15:51.840 --> 05:15:55.440
[Amit Varma]: But when you look at that term violence against women, nobody is doing it to them.

05:15:55.440 --> 05:15:56.600
[Amit Varma]: It just happens.

05:15:56.600 --> 05:15:58.360
[Unknown]: Men aren't even a part of it.

05:15:58.360 --> 05:15:59.360
[Unknown]: Stop quote.

05:15:59.360 --> 05:16:02.720
[Amit Varma]: And in the episode that I did with Shrena Bhattacharya, the loneliness of the Indian

05:16:02.720 --> 05:16:09.680
[Amit Varma]: woman, she pointed out about how women will often say something like, meri shadi ho rahi

05:16:09.680 --> 05:16:10.680
[Amit Varma]: hai.

05:16:10.680 --> 05:16:12.960
[Amit Varma]: Meri shadi ho rahi hai mein shadi kar rahi ho.

05:16:12.960 --> 05:16:16.480
[Amit Varma]: And the first sentence lacks agency, meri shadi ho rahi hai.

05:16:16.480 --> 05:16:19.800
[Amit Varma]: And the second sentence, mein shadi kar rahi ho, is a little better.

05:16:19.800 --> 05:16:22.680
[Amit Varma]: And it's just a way in which language matters.

05:16:22.680 --> 05:16:27.600
[Amit Varma]: By the way, this Jackson Katz quote was pointed out to me by one of your fellow writing course

05:16:27.600 --> 05:16:30.160
[Amit Varma]: participants, Rita Mishra.

05:16:30.160 --> 05:16:34.040
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, so I completely agree.

05:16:34.040 --> 05:16:37.520
[Amit Varma]: In just going back to the progress question, and again, I'm thinking aloud, like you've

05:16:37.520 --> 05:16:43.160
[Amit Varma]: written another great post about how when, when a man says something like, oh, I allow

05:16:43.160 --> 05:16:45.160
[Amit Varma]: my wife to work, right?

05:16:45.160 --> 05:16:50.360
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, that's such a patriarchal asshole way of saying that it's like, you know, that

05:16:50.360 --> 05:16:53.420
[Amit Varma]: she's your property, and you have to allow her to work.

05:16:53.420 --> 05:16:57.640
[Amit Varma]: But the other way of thinking about it is at least a woman is working, right?

05:16:57.640 --> 05:17:03.920
[Amit Varma]: You take baby steps, you take one step at a time, that perhaps that sure, his, his tone,

05:17:03.920 --> 05:17:07.720
[Amit Varma]: his approach that I'm allowing her to work is a problem.

05:17:07.720 --> 05:17:12.280
[Amit Varma]: But it is a much bigger problem when she was actually literally not being allowed to work.

05:17:12.280 --> 05:17:15.160
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps you have to take baby steps to kind of go ahead.

05:17:15.160 --> 05:17:18.320
[Guest]: Yeah, but then where do we stop?

05:17:18.320 --> 05:17:21.880
[Guest]: Her parents also did her a favor by allowing her to be born, no?

05:17:21.880 --> 05:17:24.880
[Guest]: So then, kitna neeche giraenge bar ko?

05:17:24.880 --> 05:17:29.760
[Guest]: So it's about, I mean, ideally, as we evolve as a society, the bar should be, should be

05:17:29.760 --> 05:17:30.760
[Amit Varma]: going higher.

05:17:30.760 --> 05:17:31.760
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

05:17:31.760 --> 05:17:38.120
[Amit Varma]: What I'm saying is that there are gradations to this, I mean, so let me turn that question

05:17:38.120 --> 05:17:42.800
[Amit Varma]: about progress around and say that, what is your sense of how much progress women have

05:17:42.800 --> 05:17:43.880
[Amit Varma]: then made?

05:17:43.880 --> 05:17:49.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, what your newsletter does so well, is that it tells you that on so many margins,

05:17:49.520 --> 05:17:52.680
[Amit Varma]: things really suck, things are really bad.

05:17:52.680 --> 05:17:55.040
[Amit Varma]: And we are in full agreement about all of that.

05:17:55.040 --> 05:17:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Has there been progress?

05:17:56.040 --> 05:17:57.120
[Amit Varma]: Is that progress?

05:17:57.120 --> 05:18:00.680
[Amit Varma]: Is there a trend line that you can see to this?

05:18:00.680 --> 05:18:05.520
[Amit Varma]: I mean, just looking at Me Too, for example, at one level, I was pretty optimistic that

05:18:05.520 --> 05:18:09.600
[Amit Varma]: things will change, perhaps too optimistic, because I thought this, at least changes the

05:18:09.600 --> 05:18:11.360
[Amit Varma]: incentives for men.

05:18:11.360 --> 05:18:16.840
[Amit Varma]: Even if men don't start behaving better deeply from inside, at least it changes their incentives.

05:18:16.840 --> 05:18:19.400
[Amit Varma]: Now, I don't know how much of that is really true.

05:18:19.400 --> 05:18:26.200
[Amit Varma]: MJ Akbar is still getting invited to literature festivals, Tarun Tejpal is still a social

05:18:26.200 --> 05:18:31.040
[Amit Varma]: gadfly on the circuits, and of course, you have a great post about Mr. Tejpal also, you

05:18:31.040 --> 05:18:32.040
[Amit Varma]: know.

05:18:32.040 --> 05:18:36.360
[Amit Varma]: So, what is your sense of the progress that has happened and the progress that is happening?

05:18:36.360 --> 05:18:41.680
[Amit Varma]: Because the older feminists have spoken to on this show in the past from Kavita Krishnan

05:18:41.680 --> 05:18:46.440
[Amit Varma]: to Manjima Bhattacharya, and so on, will say that there has been progress, it is slow,

05:18:46.440 --> 05:18:51.400
[Amit Varma]: but let's appreciate that there has been progress, and things will not suddenly change overnight.

05:18:51.400 --> 05:18:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Right?

05:18:52.400 --> 05:18:58.960
[Amit Varma]: So, what's your sense as, you know, a younger feminist and then maybe a generation down,

05:18:58.960 --> 05:19:00.960
[Amit Varma]: though I know you don't use that word, of course.

05:19:00.960 --> 05:19:06.040
[Guest]: No, I mean, by the way, it's no personal aversion to the word, I totally identify as a feminist,

05:19:06.040 --> 05:19:10.000
[Guest]: but I'm just saying that the word means different things to different people, and therefore,

05:19:10.000 --> 05:19:11.720
[Unknown]: I avoid using it.

05:19:11.720 --> 05:19:12.720
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

05:19:12.720 --> 05:19:17.280
[Guest]: If the same word has different means to different people, then it loses its utility in conveying

05:19:17.280 --> 05:19:19.720
[Guest]: meaning, which is the purpose of words.

05:19:19.720 --> 05:19:21.840
[Guest]: So sadly, that has happened to this word.

05:19:21.840 --> 05:19:25.440
[Guest]: So easily I avoided, personally, I have no aversion to it.

05:19:25.440 --> 05:19:27.960
[Guest]: I think I'm optimistic about the future.

05:19:27.960 --> 05:19:35.880
[Guest]: I have at least two young readers who have written to me, one was 12, and one is 13.

05:19:35.880 --> 05:19:40.640
[Guest]: And the 13 year old wrote to me after the Tarun Tejpal post incidentally, and I was

05:19:40.640 --> 05:19:46.520
[Guest]: horrified, because at that point, I had no idea that I had an audience, teenage audience

05:19:46.520 --> 05:19:50.880
[Guest]: out there and the Tarun Tejpal post is stark.

05:19:50.880 --> 05:19:55.880
[Guest]: I mean, it talks in graphic detail about the crime that happened against the woman and

05:19:55.880 --> 05:20:01.360
[Guest]: exactly what transpired that night, because it is important to interpret, those facts

05:20:01.360 --> 05:20:04.800
[Guest]: are important to interpret the judgment, because at every point, there is a crime happening

05:20:04.800 --> 05:20:09.240
[Guest]: against the woman and at every point, the judgment is putting the blame on the woman

05:20:09.240 --> 05:20:11.600
[Guest]: for all the crimes happening against her.

05:20:11.600 --> 05:20:18.640
[Guest]: So I had written that post and it was quite out there in explicit in the language and

05:20:18.640 --> 05:20:22.360
[Guest]: the exact nature of the crime that happened, and then I was horrified that a 13 year old

05:20:22.360 --> 05:20:28.120
[Guest]: read it and was feeling personally responsible for should I be censoring these things.

05:20:28.120 --> 05:20:31.880
[Guest]: But then the message she sent me was, I mean, it was so moving.

05:20:31.880 --> 05:20:38.280
[Guest]: She said that, ma'am, I read your post and it was so enlightening for me, there is rape

05:20:38.280 --> 05:20:44.440
[Guest]: culture and women are being raped and victimized and then our legal system is not able to give

05:20:44.440 --> 05:20:45.440
[Guest]: justice.

05:20:45.440 --> 05:20:52.720
[Guest]: And I just, I mean, at 13, I had none of these ideas, I could not use these words, this language.

05:20:52.720 --> 05:20:58.480
[Guest]: Not that I felt not empowered enough to use them, but that language was not in my mind

05:20:58.480 --> 05:20:59.480
[Guest]: at all.

05:20:59.480 --> 05:21:03.920
[Guest]: I was not thinking about these issues, I would certainly not have been able to articulate

05:21:03.920 --> 05:21:05.480
[Guest]: them as well as she did.

05:21:05.480 --> 05:21:11.480
[Guest]: And so that, then the other 12 year old reader I'm talking about is the daughter of one of

05:21:11.480 --> 05:21:17.320
[Guest]: our batchmates in the clear writing cohort, and he told me that she, every Monday she

05:21:17.320 --> 05:21:22.600
[Guest]: waits for the post and she sits and refreshes, aaya ki nahi aaya, aaya ki nahi aaya.

05:21:22.600 --> 05:21:27.120
[Guest]: So then I was like, yaar usko subscribe kara do, usko bohot jayega main box mein.

05:21:27.120 --> 05:21:33.280
[Guest]: And then he said that she sits and waits for that post and then she reads it and then Saturday

05:21:33.280 --> 05:21:37.440
[Guest]: ko she makes us sit down, ke mummy papa baitho, ab hum is hafte ki womaning post ke aare baat

05:21:37.440 --> 05:21:43.240
[Guest]: karenge, ke Mahima aunty ne kya likha hai, aur kya wo hamare ghar mein ho raha hai, and

05:21:43.240 --> 05:21:44.240
[Guest]: what can we do better.

05:21:44.240 --> 05:21:45.240
[Amit Varma]: This is amazing.

05:21:45.240 --> 05:21:46.240
[Amit Varma]: Right?

05:21:46.240 --> 05:21:50.240
[Guest]: And, and then, I mean, I wrote that post about the subtle sexism we are teaching our children,

05:21:50.240 --> 05:21:56.120
[Guest]: and in that post she sent me personally, through her dad, she sent me photos of her textbooks,

05:21:56.120 --> 05:21:57.120
[Guest]: which bothered her.

05:21:57.120 --> 05:22:01.120
[Guest]: And it is amazing to me that, wo fourth standard mein thi, aur uski textbook mein, you look

05:22:01.120 --> 05:22:08.000
[Guest]: at doctor, scientist, engineer, judge, all are men, nurse, secretary, teacher, these

05:22:08.000 --> 05:22:14.120
[Guest]: are women, and she was, she saw this, and in fourth standard, she was upset by this,

05:22:14.120 --> 05:22:18.320
[Guest]: enough to tell her dad, that why, why are women shown only in these roles and not in

05:22:18.320 --> 05:22:19.320
[Guest]: those roles?

05:22:19.320 --> 05:22:21.360
[Guest]: Can I not become a doctor when I grow up?

05:22:21.360 --> 05:22:23.280
[Guest]: Can I not become a judge when I grow up?

05:22:23.280 --> 05:22:27.800
[Guest]: And I am upset that these are the messages coming to women, and who is the author of

05:22:27.800 --> 05:22:28.800
[Guest]: this book?

05:22:28.800 --> 05:22:29.800
[Guest]: I will write a letter to them.

05:22:29.800 --> 05:22:35.800
[Guest]: And in fourth standard, it blew my mind that this happened to any individual in this country.

05:22:35.800 --> 05:22:38.000
[Guest]: And therefore, that makes me optimistic about the future.

05:22:38.000 --> 05:22:43.760
[Guest]: I know these are, so I know this is anecdotal evidence, and these are not like stark figures

05:22:43.760 --> 05:22:49.880
[Guest]: across the country kind of patterns, but I mean, I am, I am, I am amazed that even one

05:22:49.880 --> 05:22:53.520
[Guest]: such child exists in this country, and I'm sure it's not just one child.

05:22:53.520 --> 05:22:55.840
[Guest]: And therefore, the discourse is what gives me hope.

05:22:55.840 --> 05:23:00.200
[Guest]: The fact that there was a Me Too movement, I know it did not lead to the perfect kind

05:23:00.200 --> 05:23:03.800
[Guest]: of results that we wanted from it, or might have hoped for.

05:23:03.800 --> 05:23:08.880
[Guest]: But the fact that those conversations are happening, the fact that we recognize there's

05:23:08.880 --> 05:23:14.360
[Guest]: a glass ceiling, the fact that on LinkedIn, you see diversity hires for coders, and women

05:23:14.360 --> 05:23:15.880
[Guest]: can only apply for this position.

05:23:15.880 --> 05:23:16.880
[Guest]: I like it.

05:23:16.880 --> 05:23:22.120
[Guest]: I love all of that, that there is, I know in our panchayati raj system, we have a woman

05:23:22.120 --> 05:23:26.160
[Guest]: sarpanch reservation, and it leads to sarpanch patis who are controlling things from behind

05:23:26.160 --> 05:23:30.760
[Guest]: the woman, and she's cutting aloo sabzi at home, whereas he's signing all the papers

05:23:30.760 --> 05:23:33.480
[Guest]: for all the decisions to be taken in the panchayat office.

05:23:33.480 --> 05:23:34.680
[Guest]: Yeh hota hai.

05:23:34.680 --> 05:23:39.320
[Guest]: But even then, the fact that we are having these conversations, and young women of tomorrow

05:23:39.320 --> 05:23:43.920
[Guest]: are able to articulate these thoughts, are able to analyze these things, or are even

05:23:43.920 --> 05:23:47.920
[Guest]: incensed or offended by the fact that this stuff is happening around us, gives me a lot

05:23:47.920 --> 05:23:48.920
[Guest]: of hope.

05:23:48.920 --> 05:23:52.400
[Guest]: The second thing was what I said earlier about there should be an entrance exam for having

05:23:52.400 --> 05:23:53.560
[Guest]: kids.

05:23:53.560 --> 05:23:58.520
[Guest]: Because you often say that change happens one funeral at a time, but I think change

05:23:58.520 --> 05:24:03.120
[Guest]: also happens one birth at a time, however immoral you might think it is.

05:24:03.120 --> 05:24:09.320
[Guest]: And I think that if we are all able to raise the change makers of tomorrow, then we've

05:24:09.320 --> 05:24:11.600
[Guest]: done good jobs as parents.

05:24:11.600 --> 05:24:16.600
[Guest]: And so upbringing is a huge, that's why I feel like there should be an entrance exam

05:24:16.600 --> 05:24:20.840
[Guest]: because you should not bring up another person who's going to perpetuate the same crap that

05:24:20.840 --> 05:24:21.840
[Amit Varma]: we've been doing.

05:24:21.840 --> 05:24:26.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeh toh samjho yaar ki agar entrance exam hua, kaun karega state karega, who is running

05:24:26.480 --> 05:24:27.480
[Amit Varma]: the state.

05:24:27.480 --> 05:24:31.640
[Amit Varma]: The entrance exam will be selecting for sanskari parents, quote unquote, not for progressive

05:24:31.640 --> 05:24:32.640
[Guest]: parents.

05:24:32.640 --> 05:24:34.960
[Amit Varma]: Privatize kara do yaar, sarkari khatiya private karo.

05:24:34.960 --> 05:24:37.080
[Amit Varma]: That's my line, you're stealing my line.

05:24:37.080 --> 05:24:38.080
[Amit Varma]: Theek hai.

05:24:38.080 --> 05:24:41.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, this is very inspiring, and I would not dismiss that young girl who reads you

05:24:41.880 --> 05:24:44.840
[Amit Varma]: as anecdotal evidence, anecdotes are people too.

05:24:44.840 --> 05:24:49.480
[Amit Varma]: And that panchayat thing actually illustrates exactly what I mean that, you know, that even

05:24:49.480 --> 05:24:54.840
[Amit Varma]: if the sarpanch pati is kind of doing everything and she's cutting this thing, I think we have

05:24:54.840 --> 05:24:55.840
[Amit Varma]: sort of enough data.

05:24:55.840 --> 05:24:59.480
[Amit Varma]: And I think Karthik Munlidharan was talking about it in his episode with me, if I remember,

05:24:59.480 --> 05:25:00.920
[Amit Varma]: that has actually helped.

05:25:00.920 --> 05:25:04.840
[Amit Varma]: That has actually helped, it's moved the bar a little bit, it will not take you to a utopian

05:25:04.840 --> 05:25:06.280
[Unknown]: perfect solution.

05:25:06.280 --> 05:25:08.600
[Amit Varma]: But it is better than nothing, it's moved the bar a little bit.

05:25:08.600 --> 05:25:11.280
[Amit Varma]: And that's what is important.

05:25:11.280 --> 05:25:15.720
[Amit Varma]: I've just taken a lot of your time and I know being a responsible parent, you'll be wishing

05:25:15.720 --> 05:25:17.400
[Amit Varma]: to rush back home.

05:25:17.400 --> 05:25:20.240
[Amit Varma]: So just three final questions.

05:25:20.240 --> 05:25:21.720
[Amit Varma]: The digressions may occur.

05:25:21.720 --> 05:25:23.280
[Amit Varma]: Third last question.

05:25:23.280 --> 05:25:27.640
[Amit Varma]: You once told a Bollywood superstar that his movies are mythogenistic, kindly elaborate.

05:25:27.640 --> 05:25:34.100
[Guest]: Oh man, I have to really filter who, what all names I take here.

05:25:34.100 --> 05:25:36.760
[Guest]: So let's think about a fictitious sector that I worked in.

05:25:36.760 --> 05:25:39.760
[Guest]: Anyone who has heard this podcast knows what I'm talking about.

05:25:39.760 --> 05:25:43.280
[Amit Varma]: Please don't, please don't put words in my mouth.

05:25:43.280 --> 05:25:44.280
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

05:25:44.280 --> 05:25:45.280
[Amit Varma]: No words in your mouth.

05:25:45.280 --> 05:25:49.600
[Guest]: So there is a, there is a fictitious sector that I worked in.

05:25:49.600 --> 05:25:53.560
[Guest]: There was a very popular Bollywood movie which was made around this sector.

05:25:53.560 --> 05:25:54.560
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

05:25:54.560 --> 05:25:55.560
[Amit Varma]: Right.

05:25:55.560 --> 05:25:57.960
[Amit Varma]: It was the biggest hit of that year.

05:25:57.960 --> 05:26:02.760
[Guest]: And it was a movie made to raise awareness about the sector that I work in.

05:26:02.760 --> 05:26:09.000
[Guest]: So we were called in to give technical consultation on this movie that, you know, just check it,

05:26:09.000 --> 05:26:13.360
[Guest]: technology and all of that, that we show in the movie before.

05:26:13.360 --> 05:26:19.520
[Guest]: So I was on the panel of people going to Mumbai and to the star's home or his studio to review

05:26:19.520 --> 05:26:20.760
[Guest]: the movie.

05:26:20.760 --> 05:26:27.680
[Guest]: And before I went only one of the seniors at my workplace who knew my perversions took

05:26:27.680 --> 05:26:31.280
[Guest]: me aside and warned me, Mahima, none of your gender things there.

05:26:31.280 --> 05:26:32.280
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

05:26:32.280 --> 05:26:33.280
[Guest]: None of your gender things.

05:26:33.280 --> 05:26:34.280
[Guest]: Only technical.

05:26:34.280 --> 05:26:35.280
[Guest]: Nothing gender.

05:26:35.280 --> 05:26:36.280
[Guest]: Okay.

05:26:36.280 --> 05:26:37.280
[Guest]: And I was like, yes, sir.

05:26:37.280 --> 05:26:38.280
[Guest]: Yours obediently.

05:26:38.280 --> 05:26:40.600
[Guest]: So we went there.

05:26:40.600 --> 05:26:43.400
[Guest]: The star is also known for his discipline.

05:26:43.400 --> 05:26:46.440
[Guest]: So he wakes up at 4 a.m. and works out and everything, right.

05:26:46.440 --> 05:26:52.160
[Guest]: So we also had to get up at 4 a.m. to meet him because by 5 a.m. he's done with his workout

05:26:52.160 --> 05:26:55.680
[Guest]: and we have to go reach his studio by 5.

05:26:55.680 --> 05:27:00.040
[Guest]: So 5 a.m. we reached there and then they show us the movie and we are sitting in the same

05:27:00.040 --> 05:27:05.200
[Guest]: room and he's, we're sitting in a U-shape and he's sitting across from me right in front

05:27:05.200 --> 05:27:06.640
[Guest]: of the screen.

05:27:06.640 --> 05:27:11.520
[Guest]: And so the movie plays and the first half, it's like a semi-edited version, it is called

05:27:11.520 --> 05:27:12.520
[Guest]: rushes.

05:27:12.520 --> 05:27:16.280
[Guest]: Abhi full editing nahi huya, kahin kahin sound is off, kuch kuch parts nikaal diya jayenge

05:27:16.280 --> 05:27:17.280
[Guest]: and all that.

05:27:17.280 --> 05:27:19.880
[Guest]: But broadly you can see like 90% movie is there.

05:27:19.880 --> 05:27:23.040
[Guest]: So he shows it to us and first half is over.

05:27:23.040 --> 05:27:27.160
[Guest]: By the time of the first half, nothing technical has happened so far in this fictitious sector

05:27:27.160 --> 05:27:28.800
[Guest]: that relates to us.

05:27:28.800 --> 05:27:31.080
[Guest]: So really there's no feedback for us to give.

05:27:31.080 --> 05:27:36.840
[Guest]: But at the time of interval, pause liya and he looks, he looks around and he says that

05:27:36.840 --> 05:27:40.640
[Guest]: what did you all think of it, any initial thoughts and then because I'm sitting right

05:27:40.640 --> 05:27:45.360
[Guest]: across from him, he looks at me and says, let's start with the lady.

05:27:45.360 --> 05:27:51.360
[Guest]: Now if you see the first half of this film, it's basically the love story in the first

05:27:51.360 --> 05:27:52.360
[Guest]: half.

05:27:52.360 --> 05:27:58.040
[Guest]: The boy is courting the girl and when I say courting, what I mean is that she is a student,

05:27:58.040 --> 05:28:03.880
[Guest]: he is a cycle repairwala, probably 20 years elder to her, even in the fictitious world

05:28:03.880 --> 05:28:09.680
[Guest]: of the film, and is chasing her around with his mobile phone, taking pictures of her and

05:28:09.680 --> 05:28:12.000
[Guest]: videos of her without her consent.

05:28:12.000 --> 05:28:17.680
[Guest]: At one point, he prints out a photo of her on a large hoarding for his cycle shopka ad

05:28:17.680 --> 05:28:20.120
[Guest]: and that's supposed to show his love for her.

05:28:20.120 --> 05:28:25.000
[Guest]: She takes a train from one small town to another to go study to her college, wo train mein

05:28:25.000 --> 05:28:29.720
[Guest]: roz sube uske peeche chadta hai aur shaam ko cycle pe uska peecha karta hua ghar tak usse.

05:28:29.720 --> 05:28:30.720
[Amit Varma]: Max creepy.

05:28:30.720 --> 05:28:31.720
[Guest]: Max creepy.

05:28:31.720 --> 05:28:39.480
[Guest]: Now, a womaning lady is in this room and has been asked to give feedback and so far nothing

05:28:39.480 --> 05:28:45.240
[Guest]: technical has happened, only this much has happened, so, and then, and I'm, all this

05:28:45.240 --> 05:28:50.040
[Guest]: time I'm thinking, damn mujhse koi poochhe na, bas don't ask me what I think about this,

05:28:50.040 --> 05:28:52.360
[Guest]: don't ask me because I cannot hold back.

05:28:52.360 --> 05:28:58.160
[Guest]: This is exactly what is wrong with our films, you know, exactly that the woman has no agency,

05:28:58.160 --> 05:29:03.040
[Guest]: what you're showing is essentially sexual harassment and because it's your beautiful,

05:29:03.040 --> 05:29:08.520
[Guest]: lovable, loved, most loved star of India is doing it and he's a six foot tall, fair skinned,

05:29:08.520 --> 05:29:11.200
[Guest]: beautiful man, so it looks like love to us.

05:29:11.200 --> 05:29:15.040
[Guest]: But if the same thing was being done by an actual cyclewala to your daughter, you would

05:29:15.040 --> 05:29:19.200
[Guest]: be incensed and you would want him in jail today, right?

05:29:19.200 --> 05:29:23.400
[Guest]: So, but because it is this packaging, so we are calling it love.

05:29:23.400 --> 05:29:28.360
[Guest]: And I was like, mujhse koi poochhe na, bas, because I can feel the senior sitting next

05:29:28.360 --> 05:29:35.400
[Guest]: to me who told me none of your gender things and I'm like, yeh meri naukriyaat jayegi.

05:29:35.400 --> 05:29:40.800
[Guest]: And at that moment, the superstar looks at me and says, let's start with the lady.

05:29:40.800 --> 05:29:50.280
[Guest]: And I'm like that, yeah, great film, Mr. So-and-so, my only small peeve with it is, why can't

05:29:50.280 --> 05:29:53.880
[Guest]: we show a man and a woman falling in love in a Hindi movie without the man stalking

05:29:53.880 --> 05:29:55.240
[Guest]: the woman?

05:29:55.240 --> 05:30:00.720
[Guest]: And that line, I said, and I was like, hogaya mera, ab mai chup, ab meri naukri jaari hai,

05:30:00.720 --> 05:30:06.120
[Guest]: but the, how many times do you get to face the country's biggest star and tell him exactly

05:30:06.120 --> 05:30:10.560
[Amit Varma]: what is wrong in most of the, not just our country's biggest star, but arguably Canada's

05:30:10.560 --> 05:30:14.480
[Amit Varma]: biggest star also, but continue, continue.

05:30:14.480 --> 05:30:15.480
[Guest]: No comments.

05:30:15.480 --> 05:30:23.040
[Guest]: So, yeah, so then, so to my surprise, this man is horrified that I said this.

05:30:23.040 --> 05:30:25.920
[Guest]: He's not even horrified, he's surprised that I said this.

05:30:25.920 --> 05:30:28.560
[Guest]: He's taken completely aback.

05:30:28.560 --> 05:30:33.360
[Guest]: And I thought that, you know, he has a wife who's a very famous feminist, by the way.

05:30:33.360 --> 05:30:37.600
[Guest]: She's writing columns after columns about women's empowerment agency, everything.

05:30:37.600 --> 05:30:42.520
[Guest]: Like, ki isko pata hai, yeh jaan ke kar rahe hain, they're, I mean, stars, they might seem

05:30:42.520 --> 05:30:43.680
[Guest]: shallow or whatever to us.

05:30:43.680 --> 05:30:48.120
[Guest]: I'm sure they're extremely intelligent people, they've, you don't get that rich and popular

05:30:48.120 --> 05:30:52.800
[Guest]: and successful without having a serious amount of intelligence.

05:30:52.800 --> 05:30:57.600
[Guest]: So I thought, ki isko pata hai, and he's going to tell me that, you know, karna padta hai,

05:30:57.600 --> 05:31:01.480
[Guest]: or whatever, or whatever rationalization is there in his mind, it will be something reasonable.

05:31:01.480 --> 05:31:06.000
[Guest]: But then he's shocked that I said this, and he gets offended, and he says, stalking?

05:31:06.000 --> 05:31:07.720
[Guest]: Aap isko stalking kehti hain?

05:31:07.720 --> 05:31:13.320
[Guest]: So I was like, ke, haan, matlab, without her consent, you're taking her photographs.

05:31:13.320 --> 05:31:17.960
[Guest]: So he's like, kyu, aapki koi photo kheechta hai, aapko achcha nahi lagta hai?

05:31:17.960 --> 05:31:21.080
[Guest]: He's like, not without my consent, sorry.

05:31:21.080 --> 05:31:25.160
[Guest]: So he's like, hum jaate shooting karne, sab humaari photo kheechta hai.

05:31:25.160 --> 05:31:30.440
[Amit Varma]: And I was just like, stunned into silence that this man really thinks that a public

05:31:30.440 --> 05:31:36.760
[Guest]: figure's photo being taken in a public setting is the same as a man stalking a woman without

05:31:36.760 --> 05:31:41.360
[Guest]: her consent like this, through the streets of Mathura, or wherever they are.

05:31:41.360 --> 05:31:45.120
[Guest]: So I was like, yaar, I was just, I was silent after that because I was like, I've done enough

05:31:45.120 --> 05:31:50.520
[Guest]: damage to my career at this point, let's start putting our CV on LinkedIn, jo naukri gana

05:31:50.520 --> 05:31:55.320
[Guest]: liye, because I can sense the guy sitting next to me is looking daggers at me.

05:31:55.320 --> 05:32:00.760
[Guest]: And then we went around the room, and our star is very upset, and muh phula ho ekdum,

05:32:00.760 --> 05:32:05.440
[Guest]: and he's pouting, and everybody else is trying to overcompensate for the damage I have done.

05:32:05.440 --> 05:32:09.320
[Guest]: Nahi, nahi, sir, kitni achchi movie, what a great movie, this is amazing, it's going

05:32:09.320 --> 05:32:11.040
[Guest]: to be the blockbuster.

05:32:11.040 --> 05:32:16.160
[Guest]: And a couple of them even went a step ahead to counter what I had said, that, you know

05:32:16.160 --> 05:32:20.360
[Guest]: what, I disagree with what she's saying, because pyaar aise hi hota hai, asli India mein aise

05:32:20.360 --> 05:32:21.360
[Guest]: hi hota hai.

05:32:21.360 --> 05:32:25.280
[Guest]: Inko ye Delhi-Mumbai ki ladkiyon ko lagta hoga, but asli India mein aise hi hota hai.

05:32:25.280 --> 05:32:28.680
[Guest]: Maini apni bivi ko, main aise hi unka college ki aad peechha karta tha, hamara pyaar bhi

05:32:28.680 --> 05:32:30.680
[Guest]: aise hi hua tha, like to this extent.

05:32:30.680 --> 05:32:35.240
[Guest]: I was genuinely thinking that some of them are fathers of daughters, aur kuch nahi tha

05:32:35.240 --> 05:32:37.800
[Guest]: mataon, bhenon, wetiyon ke liye sochla.

05:32:37.800 --> 05:32:43.280
[Guest]: Like, would you like it if your local cycle repair shop guy is chasing your daughter across

05:32:43.280 --> 05:32:44.720
[Guest]: the street, taking her photos?

05:32:44.720 --> 05:32:45.920
[Guest]: Or anybody, you know.

05:32:45.920 --> 05:32:50.160
[Guest]: I know, I know, I'm bringing an unnecessary class angle to it, I know, but I'm just saying

05:32:50.160 --> 05:32:53.320
[Guest]: that that's the setting that is shown in the movie.

05:32:53.320 --> 05:32:57.680
[Guest]: You know, even the poshest guy comes in a Mercedes CL class and takes a photo of your

05:32:57.680 --> 05:33:04.760
[Guest]: child without her consent, you would be incensed, but because it is the handsome tall man in

05:33:04.760 --> 05:33:10.000
[Guest]: the room, the powerful alpha male in the room, you are all agreeing with him.

05:33:10.000 --> 05:33:15.240
[Guest]: And then I was like, ke chalo, in my mind, I'm already thinking of the next job and to

05:33:15.240 --> 05:33:16.240
[Guest]: have to do.

05:33:16.240 --> 05:33:22.680
[Guest]: But luckily in the room, there was this senior lady and she was at a joint secretary level

05:33:22.680 --> 05:33:26.200
[Guest]: at that time and now probably going to become a secretary soon.

05:33:26.200 --> 05:33:32.840
[Guest]: And she said that we might disagree with what Mahima said, but that is the way that the

05:33:32.840 --> 05:33:34.800
[Guest]: women of the future think.

05:33:34.800 --> 05:33:36.840
[Guest]: And I think we should respect that.

05:33:36.840 --> 05:33:38.000
[Guest]: So that's all she said.

05:33:38.000 --> 05:33:42.480
[Guest]: She was very, she's like one of the most graceful women I know.

05:33:42.480 --> 05:33:46.840
[Guest]: And that kind of shut everybody up somehow because a woman with some authority had said

05:33:46.840 --> 05:33:47.840
[Guest]: it.

05:33:47.840 --> 05:33:59.760
[Guest]: And obviously the hero was upset all through, didn't eat breakfast, but didn't lose my job

05:33:59.760 --> 05:34:00.760
[Guest]: because of that, thankfully.

05:34:00.760 --> 05:34:06.280
[Amit Varma]: You would have gone home and fought with his wife and he would, he would have said, you

05:34:06.280 --> 05:34:09.160
[Amit Varma]: know, she said this and his wife would have said she is right.

05:34:09.160 --> 05:34:15.240
[Guest]: And then they would have fought and God knows, once the film released, there were articles

05:34:15.240 --> 05:34:20.600
[Guest]: written about how this film glorifies stalking.

05:34:20.600 --> 05:34:26.040
[Guest]: And then I kind of quietly send that link to the senior gender without comment, shared

05:34:26.040 --> 05:34:31.440
[Guest]: without comment and got no response from that side, but don't do your gender thing.

05:34:31.440 --> 05:34:32.440
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

05:34:32.440 --> 05:34:36.040
[Amit Varma]: So my second last question, and this is like one of the pointers that you sent me in that

05:34:36.040 --> 05:34:38.240
[Amit Varma]: brief list of things that you wanted to talk about.

05:34:38.240 --> 05:34:39.240
[Amit Varma]: So I'll go back to that.

05:34:39.240 --> 05:34:53.160
[Amit Varma]: This pointer says how Amit Verma causes strife in my marriage.

05:34:53.160 --> 05:34:55.080
[Guest]: And this is where it comes at.

05:34:55.080 --> 05:34:56.280
[Guest]: Conversations with women are far richer.

05:34:56.280 --> 05:35:01.960
[Guest]: I can promise you can call Salil here for 10 episodes, but I'm telling you right now.

05:35:01.960 --> 05:35:08.280
[Guest]: So last two weeks back, I released the first episode of my podcast, which we were discussing

05:35:08.280 --> 05:35:11.840
[Guest]: before this, the technicalities of my mic and everything.

05:35:11.840 --> 05:35:16.600
[Guest]: So I released the first episode and a lot of people like heard it and immediately on

05:35:16.600 --> 05:35:21.200
[Guest]: that group, a comment came on our group where these writing students are there, that one

05:35:21.200 --> 05:35:24.080
[Guest]: of them said that I've just had a baby a month back.

05:35:24.080 --> 05:35:28.980
[Guest]: And that episode, that my podcast episode is about breastfeeding and how there is this

05:35:28.980 --> 05:35:32.640
[Guest]: unreasonable pressure on women that pehle din se you have to be mother dairy and then

05:35:32.640 --> 05:35:36.760
[Guest]: you have to do exactly for this many days aur iss se kam kiya toh you are an unworthy

05:35:36.760 --> 05:35:40.640
[Guest]: mother, iss se zyada kiya toh what is this creepiness, why are you still feeding a child

05:35:40.640 --> 05:35:42.160
[Guest]: who is of X age.

05:35:42.160 --> 05:35:48.480
[Guest]: So I called on my podcast, these two women, one of them, she and I were both not able

05:35:48.480 --> 05:35:52.600
[Guest]: to breastfeed beyond a point and the other one is still breastfeeding her two and a half

05:35:52.600 --> 05:35:53.600
[Guest]: year old.

05:35:53.600 --> 05:35:57.240
[Guest]: So we were all talking about that again, you know, there's no middle ground, there is no

05:35:57.240 --> 05:36:02.040
[Guest]: one is eating the sweet spot of everyone's approval when it comes to these things.

05:36:02.040 --> 05:36:06.680
[Guest]: And so one of the women on our group said that I just had a baby and in the last one

05:36:06.680 --> 05:36:11.160
[Guest]: month since I've had a baby, I've felt like a monster who is not able to do something

05:36:11.160 --> 05:36:14.680
[Guest]: that seems to come so easily to all other women.

05:36:14.680 --> 05:36:17.960
[Guest]: And thank you for finally talking about this and it's the first time in a month that I've

05:36:17.960 --> 05:36:22.600
[Guest]: smiled and I found that so heartwarming, I felt again, you know, mission accomplished

05:36:22.600 --> 05:36:26.920
[Guest]: wali feeling ke bas isi ke liye kar rahe the, if it is serving this purpose, it's, I've

05:36:26.920 --> 05:36:27.920
[Guest]: done my job.

05:36:27.920 --> 05:36:33.600
[Guest]: So shaam ko Salil comes home and I'm like, did you like it, how it was, he's like, nahi

05:36:33.600 --> 05:36:39.520
[Guest]: I'm still listening to Seen and the Unseen and I'm like, maine aaj podcast nikala hai,

05:36:39.520 --> 05:36:44.680
[Guest]: pehle episode hai, you're listening to, I understand the rest of the world, I'm putting

05:36:44.680 --> 05:36:49.240
[Guest]: it out on a Monday, I can't compete with Seen and the Unseen but tum toh sun lo.

05:36:49.240 --> 05:36:54.640
[Guest]: And he's like, nahi nahi, Amit's guest this time, she's from my school and I was like,

05:36:54.640 --> 05:37:00.640
[Guest]: he's in the podcast, I'm like, your wife is in this podcast, can you prioritize, please.

05:37:00.640 --> 05:37:05.200
[Guest]: And then on the flip side also, it happens that sometimes he'll recommend a book to me,

05:37:05.200 --> 05:37:10.160
[Guest]: like Rukmini's book, he would, I would be watching crap on Netflix and he would come

05:37:10.160 --> 05:37:15.760
[Guest]: and shove that book under my nose, yeh padho, this, you are woman and you need to read this.

05:37:15.760 --> 05:37:20.760
[Guest]: And then I was like, yaha padh lenge, I'm too tired right now, mental load saara off

05:37:20.760 --> 05:37:25.920
[Guest]: ke main, tabs thodi dair hibernation mein daal ke, I'm right now wedging, so don't come

05:37:25.920 --> 05:37:31.000
[Guest]: into my wedge time and yeah, I know your books, your taste is very intellectual and all, toh.

05:37:31.000 --> 05:37:35.920
[Guest]: But then I listened to your episode with Rukmini and I was like, yeh book toh padhni padhegi.

05:37:35.920 --> 05:37:37.720
[Guest]: Yeah, this is a great book, yeah.

05:37:37.720 --> 05:37:38.720
[Guest]: I know, right?

05:37:38.720 --> 05:37:43.520
[Guest]: So then he gets very upset ke, maine kaha tha toh kuch nahi, aur Amit ne kaha hai, toh

05:37:43.520 --> 05:37:44.520
[Guest]: padhni hai.

05:37:44.520 --> 05:37:45.520
[Guest]: Wow.

05:37:45.520 --> 05:37:48.280
[Guest]: So there's a lot of strife that you cause.

05:37:48.280 --> 05:37:52.200
[Amit Varma]: I'm so sorry, ab main kya karu, main podcast rokh doon, rokh bhi diya, aapke kaaran toh

05:37:52.200 --> 05:37:53.200
[Guest]: aur strife hoga na.

05:37:53.200 --> 05:37:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Nah, nah, nah, mat rokh, hum lal denge, hum log sort out kar lenge.

05:37:57.000 --> 05:38:01.560
[Amit Varma]: That's so sweet of you guys and I'm very honoured and humbled, but please don't strife on my

05:38:01.560 --> 05:38:04.320
[Amit Varma]: behalf if I may turn it into a verb.

05:38:04.320 --> 05:38:05.320
[Amit Varma]: Final question.

05:38:05.320 --> 05:38:11.320
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, for my listeners, what would you like to recommend that they read or they

05:38:11.320 --> 05:38:17.040
[Amit Varma]: listen to or they watch or they, you know, any arts that give you great joy?

05:38:17.040 --> 05:38:25.240
[Guest]: So there's a lovely book called How to Be Successful Without Hurting Men's Feelings.

05:38:25.240 --> 05:38:29.480
[Guest]: It's a wonderful book, it's a collection of couple of comics by Sarah Cooper.

05:38:29.480 --> 05:38:36.080
[Guest]: And I mean, I think a couple of clips of this book have gone viral online about, you know,

05:38:36.080 --> 05:38:40.160
[Guest]: how a woman says something and the man ignores, then she puts a moustache on her face and

05:38:40.160 --> 05:38:41.160
[Guest]: says the same thing.

05:38:41.160 --> 05:38:42.160
[Guest]: And then they're like, what a great idea.

05:38:42.160 --> 05:38:47.920
[Guest]: So it's a hilarious book and it's talking about everything that we discussed about women

05:38:47.920 --> 05:38:51.000
[Guest]: not being taken seriously at work.

05:38:51.000 --> 05:38:57.840
[Guest]: Then Invisible Women, which I've already quoted from in this episode so far.

05:38:57.840 --> 05:38:59.840
[Guest]: By Caroline Priada Perez.

05:38:59.840 --> 05:39:00.840
[Guest]: Yes.

05:39:00.840 --> 05:39:04.680
[Guest]: There is a book called Untamed by Glennon Doyle.

05:39:04.680 --> 05:39:10.160
[Guest]: So Glennon Doyle has published books in the past as well.

05:39:10.160 --> 05:39:13.840
[Guest]: But this book has come out after big changes in her life.

05:39:13.840 --> 05:39:17.440
[Guest]: So she was earlier a drug addict and then she got married.

05:39:17.440 --> 05:39:20.920
[Guest]: She had a baby and immediately the day she found out she was pregnant, she quit drugs

05:39:20.920 --> 05:39:23.800
[Guest]: and before that it was like beyond control.

05:39:23.800 --> 05:39:25.480
[Guest]: It was damaging her life seriously.

05:39:25.480 --> 05:39:29.680
[Guest]: And then she had, I think now she has two or three kids.

05:39:29.680 --> 05:39:33.640
[Guest]: After a while, she also figured out that her marriage was no longer working.

05:39:33.640 --> 05:39:37.720
[Guest]: And then she fell in love with another woman and is now married to her.

05:39:37.720 --> 05:39:42.640
[Guest]: And all through this journey, she also was very, very religious, very strong Christian

05:39:42.640 --> 05:39:43.640
[Guest]: ethic.

05:39:43.640 --> 05:39:49.360
[Guest]: And I think in some ways she still is, but it comes from a very modern take on that religion.

05:39:49.360 --> 05:39:56.200
[Guest]: And I loved it as reading it as a woman and as a mother especially, like I love this couple

05:39:56.200 --> 05:40:00.000
[Guest]: of excerpts from it, which I would take photos of and share on these moms groups that I'm

05:40:00.000 --> 05:40:01.000
[Guest]: on.

05:40:01.000 --> 05:40:05.720
[Guest]: One of which was about how she said that I was raising my, I think she has two daughters

05:40:05.720 --> 05:40:06.720
[Guest]: and one son.

05:40:06.720 --> 05:40:09.400
[Guest]: And she said, I was raising my daughters to be strong women.

05:40:09.400 --> 05:40:13.200
[Guest]: And you know, walking down the street, I would point to a random woman and say, what do you

05:40:13.200 --> 05:40:14.200
[Guest]: think she is?

05:40:14.200 --> 05:40:18.160
[Guest]: Maybe she's a CEO, maybe she's an engineer, maybe she's a doctor.

05:40:18.160 --> 05:40:23.200
[Guest]: And you know, just to make them think of women as not in those traditional domestic roles,

05:40:23.200 --> 05:40:27.620
[Guest]: but also as beyond that and people who can accomplish anything.

05:40:27.620 --> 05:40:31.320
[Guest]: But then she thought that one day her son said something very regressive.

05:40:31.320 --> 05:40:36.300
[Guest]: And she said that, I realized that I don't need to just build strong women for the future,

05:40:36.300 --> 05:40:39.480
[Guest]: but also men who are ready for that future, for those women.

05:40:39.480 --> 05:40:44.100
[Guest]: So I realized that as a mother, I had been failing my son on that account.

05:40:44.100 --> 05:40:47.360
[Guest]: And so then she said that now when I walk down the street with my son, I point to men

05:40:47.360 --> 05:40:48.640
[Guest]: and say, what do you think he is?

05:40:48.640 --> 05:40:50.520
[Guest]: Maybe he's a very loving father.

05:40:50.520 --> 05:40:52.520
[Guest]: Maybe he makes great pasta for dinner.

05:40:52.520 --> 05:40:56.440
[Guest]: You know, things like that, which is again, not the traditional roles that you would see

05:40:56.440 --> 05:40:59.120
[Guest]: men in, but to make him think of other men like that.

05:40:59.120 --> 05:41:05.520
[Guest]: So he also starts seeing himself as those as valid roles that he could grow into.

05:41:05.520 --> 05:41:08.440
[Guest]: So that's a book I wanted to recommend.

05:41:08.440 --> 05:41:11.560
[Guest]: There's another book called Shrill by Lindy West.

05:41:11.560 --> 05:41:16.440
[Guest]: So the reason I read this book, it's a very angry book and a very funny book too.

05:41:16.440 --> 05:41:21.120
[Guest]: But so the reason I read this book was somebody quoted a line to it, which spoke to me, which

05:41:21.120 --> 05:41:26.920
[Guest]: was that feminism is about realizing that everything you love hates you back.

05:41:26.920 --> 05:41:30.440
[Guest]: That's the perfect summary of my relationship with Bollywood, right?

05:41:30.440 --> 05:41:31.440
[Guest]: I love Bollywood.

05:41:31.440 --> 05:41:35.760
[Guest]: I can still to this day sit and watch any old 90s regressive movie.

05:41:35.760 --> 05:41:40.200
[Guest]: I will find all the regressive shit in it, but I'll still enjoy it because I'm programmed

05:41:40.200 --> 05:41:41.320
[Guest]: to love it now.

05:41:41.320 --> 05:41:43.520
[Guest]: And I know it hates me as a woman, right?

05:41:43.520 --> 05:41:47.200
[Guest]: Like, I'm still waiting for the DDLJ joke, by the way.

05:41:47.200 --> 05:41:49.920
[Amit Varma]: We'll tell you in the next episode.

05:41:49.920 --> 05:41:50.920
[Guest]: It's okay.

05:41:50.920 --> 05:41:55.280
[Guest]: Small things like this happen in big cities.

05:41:55.280 --> 05:42:02.160
[Guest]: Okay, or another thing that I wanted to recommend was another book is Steal Like An Artist.

05:42:02.160 --> 05:42:04.960
[Guest]: Then there's another called Show Your Work and third one called Keep Going.

05:42:04.960 --> 05:42:09.800
[Guest]: All three are by Austin Kleon, which are basically books that anyone who wants to write and wants

05:42:09.800 --> 05:42:14.120
[Guest]: to be any kind of creator or artist should just keep on their table at all times.

05:42:14.120 --> 05:42:19.040
[Guest]: They're very, very small books, thin, short books, very easily accessible.

05:42:19.040 --> 05:42:22.800
[Guest]: Kisi bhi din kuch bhi uthage, koi bhi page padlo and it'll inspire you in some way.

05:42:22.800 --> 05:42:29.080
[Guest]: So these are three beautiful books that I keep very accessible at hand.

05:42:29.080 --> 05:42:34.680
[Guest]: I also wanted to recommend a couple of stand-up comedians because I follow stand-up comedy

05:42:34.680 --> 05:42:35.680
[Guest]: like anything.

05:42:35.680 --> 05:42:40.040
[Guest]: I've also dabbled in it quite successfully, but a bit.

05:42:40.040 --> 05:42:42.120
[Guest]: One is Hannah Gatsby.

05:42:42.120 --> 05:42:44.640
[Guest]: One is Tig Notaro.

05:42:44.640 --> 05:42:49.360
[Guest]: And among men, there's James A. Castor and Indian side, there's a guy called Karunesh

05:42:49.360 --> 05:42:50.360
[Guest]: Talwar.

05:42:50.360 --> 05:42:56.040
[Guest]: All four of them are excellent and amazing for different reasons, which we can discuss

05:42:56.040 --> 05:42:57.040
[Guest]: another time.

05:42:57.040 --> 05:42:59.600
[Guest]: But if you haven't heard of them, please look them up.

05:42:59.600 --> 05:43:04.880
[Guest]: And if you enjoy stand-up comedy, they to me sound like the voice of the future.

05:43:04.880 --> 05:43:06.600
[Amit Varma]: We didn't even talk about your stand-up comedy.

05:43:06.600 --> 05:43:08.760
[Guest]: Are you going to try again?

05:43:08.760 --> 05:43:09.760
[Guest]: I don't know.

05:43:09.760 --> 05:43:10.760
[Amit Varma]: Maybe, maybe not.

05:43:10.760 --> 05:43:11.760
[Amit Varma]: At one point you wanted to, right?

05:43:11.760 --> 05:43:12.760
[Guest]: You did some gigs.

05:43:12.760 --> 05:43:13.760
[Guest]: I did some gigs.

05:43:13.760 --> 05:43:14.760
[Guest]: Yes, yes.

05:43:14.760 --> 05:43:21.600
[Guest]: And so, in fact, one of them was in CP in Central Park and it was, I was told by the

05:43:21.600 --> 05:43:25.200
[Guest]: organisers there that there was an audience of 5000 people, which I don't think was there

05:43:25.200 --> 05:43:26.200
[Guest]: at one time.

05:43:26.200 --> 05:43:28.560
[Guest]: I think they just did a total count over the evening.

05:43:28.560 --> 05:43:32.960
[Guest]: But there are a series of artists and for me, that memory is very great because whatever

05:43:32.960 --> 05:43:35.240
[Guest]: I did, I'm sure I will cringe at it today.

05:43:35.240 --> 05:43:38.760
[Guest]: And by the way, open challenge to all your listeners, ke koi dhond ke dikhao wo video.

05:43:38.760 --> 05:43:42.000
[Guest]: Wo video is somewhere in one corner of the internet.

05:43:42.000 --> 05:43:46.640
[Guest]: I know how to find it, but it's very hard to find because the people I did it for were

05:43:46.640 --> 05:43:48.920
[Guest]: kind enough to not give me any credits.

05:43:48.920 --> 05:43:51.400
[Guest]: So there is, you can't find it by my name probably.

05:43:51.400 --> 05:43:58.000
[Guest]: Anyway, so that, that thing I did and as I was getting off stage, the late Ms. Kamila

05:43:58.000 --> 05:43:59.320
[Guest]: Bhasin was there.

05:43:59.320 --> 05:44:03.480
[Guest]: She was one of the organisers of that event and she came up to me and congratulated me

05:44:03.480 --> 05:44:04.480
[Guest]: and shook my hand.

05:44:04.480 --> 05:44:09.680
[Guest]: I was like surreal because it was probably the third or fourth performance I was doing

05:44:09.680 --> 05:44:16.120
[Guest]: and I was like, please, what are you even saying, Ms. Kamila, you are the OG.

05:44:16.120 --> 05:44:20.240
[Guest]: And she was like, nahi nahi hum toh kuch nahi hain, aap artist hain, aap logon hi hain, kalki

05:44:20.240 --> 05:44:21.240
[Guest]: awaaz.

05:44:21.240 --> 05:44:24.360
[Guest]: And it was just, it was very touching and it was very surreal.

05:44:24.360 --> 05:44:26.480
[Guest]: Maybe I'll get back to it someday, don't know right now.

05:44:26.480 --> 05:44:28.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah, I would love to see that.

05:44:28.320 --> 05:44:32.200
[Amit Varma]: But in the meantime, keep doing what you're doing, more power to womaning and anything

05:44:32.200 --> 05:44:33.200
