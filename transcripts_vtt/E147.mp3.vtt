[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.960
[Amit Varma]: So, you have Jahangir's minions holding the snake, forcing his mouth open and shoving

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.280
[Amit Varma]: the rabbit inside.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.480
[Amit Varma]: In the process, the mouth of the hapless snake is torn and it perishes.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.200
[Amit Varma]: Not the first or last victim of the whims of an autocrat drunk on power.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.760
[Amit Varma]: And this reminded me of modern times, because we see many of our leaders treat our economy

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.400
[Amit Varma]: just as Jahangir treated that snake.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.120
[Amit Varma]: I wish Jahangir had just left that snake alone.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.000
[Amit Varma]: The moral of the story, as you would have guessed by now, is this, the snake died.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.920
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.920
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.920
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.840
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.760
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Parvati Sharma and we'll be talking about her book, Jahangir, an intimate

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.620
[Amit Varma]: portrait of a great Mughal.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.120
[Amit Varma]: This is not only a serious book of history that contained many insights and TIL moments

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.520
[Amit Varma]: for me, but it was also a fantastically entertaining book to read with many moments that made me

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.880
[Amit Varma]: laugh out loud.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.280
[Amit Varma]: Also, as much as it is a book of history, it is also a story about people with all their

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.440
[Amit Varma]: flaws and insecurities and idiosyncrasies.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.520
[Amit Varma]: It's quite apt to call this, as the subtitle of the book suggests, an intimate portrait,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.280
[Amit Varma]: because it did feel like I got some insight into Jahangir the man through this book.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.000
[Amit Varma]: I also have another reason for doing this episode.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.560
[Amit Varma]: Every episode of the scene and the unseen through its nearly 150 episode history has

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.080
[Amit Varma]: featured a Verma.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.040
[Amit Varma]: I've never had a Sharma on the show.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.440
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.480
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.840
[Amit Varma]: Well, worry no more.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.920
[Guest]: Thank you very much, Amit.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.920
[Guest]: It's lovely to be here.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.120
[Guest]: Glad to be the first Sharma on your show.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.440
[Guest]: And that story that you told about the snake, I'm glad you picked that.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.560
[Guest]: That was one of my many favorite stories when I was writing this book.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.840
[Guest]: And people used to get a little worried when they saw me approach, but I just couldn't

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.840
[Guest]: stop telling them.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.400
[Guest]: My Jahangir story is the latest mad thing I had read of this man doing.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.740
[Guest]: And this was one of my top, top five.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.440
[Amit Varma]: This is a fantastic story, but there are, like you said, so many fantastic stories.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.400
[Amit Varma]: And we'll, you know, come back to some of them during our conversation.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.180
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to ancient times and before we get to Jahangir, let's talk a little bit

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.640
[Amit Varma]: more about yourself.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.800
[Amit Varma]: I've heard you mentioned that you didn't really like history in school.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.880
[Guest]: I know I won't say I didn't like history in school.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:09.280
[Guest]: I think for much of my schooling, I was sort of indifferent to it.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.760
[Guest]: Really in the sense that it was, it didn't seem to go anywhere or mean anything.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:23.960
[Guest]: And it was just these sort of abstractions and these dates and these names, you know,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.840
[Guest]: and the Mauryas and the Guptas and the Cholas and the Pandyas and the Pallavas and the Rashtrakutas

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840
[Amit Varma]: and the Mughals.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.840
[Guest]: And a sunny dual would say, Tariq pe Tariq.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.000
[Guest]: Tariq pe Tariq, yes.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.320
[Guest]: None of it added up to anything.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:46.960
[Guest]: But I think I did begin to enjoy it towards the end, like in my 11th and 12th standard.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.800
[Guest]: And but even then I didn't, in college I was always drawn towards literature and that's

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.800
[Guest]: what I wanted to study.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.840
[Guest]: But I think after three years of English, I wanted to do sort of what I thought at the

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.480
[Guest]: time rather naively, real stories.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.520
[Guest]: You know, I wanted to know the true things.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.960
[Guest]: So then I went back to studying history.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.120
[Guest]: And that's when I really began to, you know, began to enjoy it.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.720
[Guest]: Because I think that sort of the disciplines of literature and history are not very far

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.720
[Guest]: apart.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.400
[Guest]: Some of similar sort of faculties and have similar pleasures.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.240
[Amit Varma]: And did you always want to be a writer?

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.400
[Guest]: I always wanted to be a writer, yes.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.120
[Guest]: I don't even know from when.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.040
[Guest]: I mean, I always wanted to be a writer.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.200
[Guest]: I always wanted to be published.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:43.360
[Guest]: And as the older I got, and the less published I was, the sadder I became.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.040
[Guest]: And I remember, you know, I think turning 30, which was also a stressful moment.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:56.320
[Guest]: And generally bevelling my fate and saying, oh, I will never, never be published.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.920
[Guest]: And a friend said to me, she said that, you know, if you don't write, what will anyone

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.920
[Guest]: publish?

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:09.800
[Guest]: And then, you know, we were talking earlier about discipline in writing.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.480
[Guest]: And that's when I started doing this, at her suggestion only, writing every day.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.440
[Guest]: You just sit and write for one hour every day, or at least sit in front of your computer

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.640
[Guest]: for one hour every day regardless of what comes out.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.920
[Guest]: And I started doing that like exercise.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.120
[Guest]: And it, you know, it worked because it's like a muscle, you know, you strengthen it the

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.120
[Guest]: more you do it.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:37.640
[Guest]: So yeah, so that I think is when I started writing with some kind of plan.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.680
[Guest]: But, but much before that, I mean, from as long back as I can remember, sort of scribbling

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:50.280
[Guest]: away in diaries and things and trying to imitate whatever, whoever I liked at the moment, at

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.640
[Guest]: that time, whichever writer I was reading, I wanted to, you know, be that writer.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.640
[Amit Varma]: So yeah.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.520
[Amit Varma]: It sounds very similar to me, I remember when as a kid, I used to read Shakespeare, I had

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.600
[Amit Varma]: this brief phase when I tried to write like Shakespeare in that language, which is extremely

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.040
[Amit Varma]: silly and don't try this at home.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.120
[Amit Varma]: And I also was unpublished before 30.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.800
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting, you know, our mutual friend Manu Pillay was on the show.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.400
[Guest]: Yes, he's not 30.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, he's just about to turn 30 or turn 30.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.600
[Amit Varma]: And he mentioned to me while, you know, while we were having coffee before one of his shows,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.800
[Amit Varma]: and it made me very angry, I wanted to punch him.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.080
[Amit Varma]: He said that, you know, this book has fulfilled an ambition of mine.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.640
[Amit Varma]: And I said, What is that?

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.920
[Amit Varma]: And he said, I wanted to write three books before I was 30.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:37.200
[Amit Varma]: And I was like, this kid has barely started shaving and reaching such heights.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.840
[Amit Varma]: But now you also have written many books.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.880
[Amit Varma]: And so to start with, did you you saw yourself as a writer of fiction, right?

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.880
[Amit Varma]: Always, yeah.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.240
[Guest]: Yeah, that was what I always wanted to write.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:56.920
[Guest]: And it's also what I always enjoyed reading, you know, I loved books and fiction.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.160
[Guest]: So I wanted to write them.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.920
[Amit Varma]: Who was who was sort of the writers that you really liked, or the writers that you thought

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.600
[Amit Varma]: that you might one day write like?

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.800
[Amit Varma]: I mean, in the sense, that's sort of my space, that kind of thing.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.680
[Guest]: You know, so like, so every everyone at that moment, whoever it was, so so so like your

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:23.600
[Guest]: Shakespeare, I also I took on Dostoevsky at the age of I think, 16 or 17, I read Crime

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.360
[Guest]: and Punishment and I didn't like the ending at all.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.360
[Guest]: I was like, what is this?

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.360
[Guest]: I can do better.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360
[Unknown]: Did you?

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.360
[Guest]: I rewrote the ending.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.560
[Amit Varma]: You rewrote the ending of Crime and Punishment.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.240
[Guest]: So I think the punishment for that was that I was not able to write anything worthwhile

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240
[Guest]: until I was 30.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.200
[Guest]: This kind of arrogance should not just go ignored by the universe.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:50.080
[Guest]: But, you know, there's some like deep influences, you know, from childhood.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.720
[Guest]: I think I think Roald Dahl was one.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.680
[Guest]: Something about and even now I think something about just that, that sort of manic flow,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.240
[Guest]: momentum and energy that he has in all his writing, both for adults and children, is

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.480
[Guest]: something that I aspire to.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.480
[Guest]: P.G.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:14.400
[Guest]: Woodhouse, of course, I remember I think also sometime in college reading The God of Small

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.800
[Guest]: Things and really being completely blown away by it.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:25.160
[Guest]: I think I started it something after dinner and I read the whole night.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:32.920
[Guest]: And I think part of the reason it was the way it was written, all that was fantastic.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:40.040
[Guest]: But also somehow at that time, in that place, it was somehow reflecting a world that I knew,

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:48.480
[Guest]: which was unusual, you know, still at that time in fiction that I was reading, even in

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.200
[Guest]: fiction written by Indians, it was unusual.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.440
[Guest]: So yeah, I mean.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.560
[Amit Varma]: And that's very interesting because I can understand why you are a fan of Roald Dahl

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.120
[Amit Varma]: and because, you know, like him again, you've written for both adults and children.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.800
[Amit Varma]: The Arundhati Roy took me a little by surprise because your voice is very different in a

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:12.120
[Amit Varma]: good way in the sense that, I mean, I'm not a, my personal bias is that I'm not a fan

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:17.640
[Amit Varma]: of the very highly stylized kind of writers for whom language is very important.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.760
[Amit Varma]: And I find people like Rushdie and Arundhati a little excessive in that sense that your

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.960
[Amit Varma]: attention is constantly drawn to the writing style.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.960
[Amit Varma]: And I find that your style is, say, much more in a way of, say, Vikram said, very understated

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.920
[Amit Varma]: and very clear.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.880
[Amit Varma]: And did you, you know, in your process of sort of writing, and especially when you were

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.120
[Amit Varma]: writing your children's books, did you find yourself giving a lot of thought to, say,

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.760
[Amit Varma]: the craft of writing?

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.760
[Amit Varma]: How do you write sentences?

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.520
[Amit Varma]: How do you put together narratives?

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.520
[Amit Varma]: What should you do?

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.520
[Guest]: What should you not do?

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.080
[Guest]: Yeah, I think, you know, with every book, it's been something that, you know, some,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.320
[Guest]: something that I've had to learn in order to do it.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:05.680
[Guest]: And I think, you know, my first book was a collection of short stories.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:13.800
[Guest]: And I think there, a lot of the focus was on the craft of writing, I suggest, the sentence

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.160
[Guest]: level stuff, you know, and that, which I enjoyed.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.120
[Guest]: And for me, it was the least taxing.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.600
[Guest]: And for me, I find as a writer, the most difficult thing is plotting, and which is the sort of

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.000
[Guest]: barrier I encountered when I, you know, after that, I wanted to, you know, I wanted to write

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.520
[Guest]: a novel.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:39.920
[Guest]: And you can't, I mean, doing sort of meandering, plotless short stories is one thing.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.160
[Guest]: But plotless novel is a whole other thing.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.160
[Guest]: And of course, you can do that.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.600
[Guest]: But plotless novels are not even novels that I enjoy reading.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.520
[Guest]: I mean, I like plots, I like a story.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:54.680
[Guest]: I like, and I realized that it's to me, I think, four years and about six revisions

00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:00.080
[Guest]: to get that very slim novella done.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.200
[Guest]: Because I was, in the end, I realized what the problem was not just that the plot was

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.480
[Guest]: not falling into place.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.440
[Guest]: But also, there was no momentum building and two things have to go together.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.280
[Guest]: You know, you have to have a kind of momentum build up to take the plot from one thing to

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.720
[Guest]: the next.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.480
[Guest]: So that was a difficult sort of experience.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.840
[Guest]: And I think the similar thing I learned with that, after that, I did this book for children,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.160
[Guest]: the story of Babur.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.440
[Guest]: And there, I learned the same thing.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.840
[Guest]: But even more, you know, because with kids, there was very little room for anything that

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:42.040
[Guest]: is not moving the action forward, you know, something has to be happening.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:48.400
[Guest]: And I found that that was very energizing for me to have to do that, you know, as as

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.840
[Guest]: a writer, that was great fun of it that you know, that there was no there was no diversions,

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.000
[Guest]: there were no digressions, you're just going from one thing to the next.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.320
[Guest]: And you know, maintain that, maintain interest and action.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.560
[Amit Varma]: Do you feel that changed you as a writer in general, writing for children?

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.080
[Guest]: I think so.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.080
[Guest]: I do.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.880
[Guest]: I felt I felt a kind of livelier spirit.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.240
[Guest]: I don't know if that's how that sounds.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.440
[Guest]: But yeah, I felt a greater energy.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.760
[Guest]: And I went from there, I was working on another novel.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:23.800
[Guest]: And I wrote that novel with something of that, you know, children's book, momentum and energy

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.800
[Guest]: in mind.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.800
[Guest]: And it did.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.280
[Guest]: It helped really did.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.160
[Amit Varma]: It was a...

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.280
[Amit Varma]: And so your first brush with writing history would therefore have been the book on Babur.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.680
[Amit Varma]: And like, of course, you had a readymade plot there.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.240
[Amit Varma]: But did the process of writing that book sort of change the way you look at the Mughals

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.520
[Amit Varma]: or the way you looked at the history of that period?

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:57.080
[Guest]: I don't know if it changed it because I hadn't even thought, you know, that much about history

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.800
[Guest]: in general or the Mughals in particular, except in the way that you know, everyone sort of

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.800
[Guest]: when you come across something or you know.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:10.720
[Guest]: But I hadn't really taken any particular trouble to find out anything.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.040
[Guest]: And but it did.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.800
[Guest]: It took me completely by surprise.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:22.280
[Guest]: What took me completely by surprise was the Babur Nama, which, you know, I started reading

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:28.400
[Guest]: not really knowing what to expect and not...

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.160
[Guest]: And then actually expecting more some kind of sort of dry recital of events or, you know,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:41.080
[Guest]: or sort of dates and facts and figures and things like that.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:50.480
[Guest]: And instead, it turned out to be this really, really sort of lucid, unselfconscious account

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.200
[Guest]: of this man's life.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:58.400
[Guest]: And it and you know, right in the beginning, like within the first few pages, there's a

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.200
[Guest]: description, a barber is talking about his father.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.200
[Amit Varma]: Over eating.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200
[Amit Varma]: Over eating.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.320
[Guest]: He was sort of a rotund man.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:09.240
[Guest]: And once he had eaten and feasted, he would he was also sort of cheerful, he would laugh.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:14.600
[Guest]: And he says the laces of his tunic would snap open.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:21.400
[Guest]: And you know, immediately like the image you get is of this young child watching his father,

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.320
[Guest]: the king, you know, his laces of his tunic snapping open.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.400
[Guest]: And there's a sort of little mischief and humour and affection.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.400
[Amit Varma]: And such a literary detail also.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400
[Guest]: Yes, that's also.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.400
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.800
[Guest]: So, you know, that kind of detail that I wasn't expecting at all, but it really helped to

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.920
[Guest]: get a sense of Babur the man.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.680
[Amit Varma]: And yet the Babur Nama is very different from, for example, the Jahangir Nama, in the sense

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.520
[Amit Varma]: that you mentioned how the Jahangir Nama is really Jahangir was keeping a diary.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.840
[Unknown]: So it's not like a narrative written after a period of time.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.960
[Amit Varma]: It's life unfolding as it is.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:04.680
[Amit Varma]: And it has that immediacy and the seeming candour and the Babur Nama, Babur, you've

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.520
[Amit Varma]: mentioned that he was sort of writing it with an eye on history as well.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:13.560
[Amit Varma]: It's also an act of, you know, creating a narrative about himself.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.800
[Guest]: He is sort of writing it as his memoirs.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.160
[Guest]: And Jahangir is writing it as his diary.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.640
[Guest]: So there is in that sense, just the texture of it is different.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:29.680
[Guest]: You know, Babur Nama is more like a record of significant things that happened in his

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.680
[Guest]: life.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:35.200
[Guest]: But Jahangir is like exciting things happened yesterday.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.200
[Amit Varma]: You know that.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.360
[Unknown]: I saw a snake eating a rabbit.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.680
[Amit Varma]: And let's kind of come to Jahangir.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.080
[Amit Varma]: And it's very interesting that you chose Jahangir as a subject, because typically when you think

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.760
[Amit Varma]: of the Mughals, of course, there were sort of six great Mughals before the decline began,

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:58.320
[Amit Varma]: which is Babur Humayun, Akbar Jahangir, Shah Jahan and the infamous Aurangzeb.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:04.240
[Amit Varma]: And Jahangir is sort of like a lost figure who for a long time has not been taken seriously

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.080
[Amit Varma]: by historians so much.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.320
[Amit Varma]: He's, you know, he's been painted as ineffectual.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.120
[Amit Varma]: He's not focused on conquering new territory like emperors are.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.120
[Amit Varma]: He's sort of a weak man.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.840
[Amit Varma]: He drinks a lot and so on.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:23.040
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that I learned while reading your book was that historians are

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.960
[Amit Varma]: now beginning to feel that he wasn't necessarily like this, that these are the imperatives

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:35.800
[Amit Varma]: that come from one how Shah Jahan wanted to portray him to sort of justify his own acts

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:43.520
[Amit Varma]: and to the work of Thomas Rowe, the East India Company emissary who was at the time there.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.080
[Amit Varma]: And he also had his own incentives, if I may use a term I use often on the show, in painting

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.560
[Amit Varma]: Jahangir in a particular way.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.200
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about this.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.520
[Guest]: Yeah, no, so that was that was interesting for me also to discover this.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:03.680
[Guest]: This particular argument is made by Corinne Lefebvre, who's a French historian who is

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.160
[Guest]: sort of re-evaluating both Jahangir's life and the Jahangir Nama.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:15.960
[Guest]: And so when I was writing this book, in the first draft of it, the idea that I had of

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:27.840
[Guest]: this man was of like a sort of well-meaning, amiable, but dissolute, overall, not sort

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.840
[Guest]: of a lightweight, you know, entertaining, but not for the ages.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:39.160
[Guest]: I mean, on the other hand, he ruled for 22 years, but even that, the generally accepted

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:46.240
[Guest]: sense that you gather if you read, you know, around him, is that Akbar had built up such

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:52.840
[Guest]: a strong empire that you would need, you know, another Akbar to even to undo it.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:59.720
[Guest]: You know, even that would require more sort of energy than Jahangir was inclined to display

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.720
[Guest]: in his life.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:06.400
[Guest]: But, you know, I was discussing this with a friend who's also a historian who was a

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.560
[Guest]: great help to me in the writing of this book, Anubhuti Maurya.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:17.160
[Guest]: Well, you know, but she said, it's not really necessarily true that just on the momentum

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.280
[Guest]: of Akbar's centralization of power and creation of empire, that Jahangir would have been able

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.720
[Guest]: to rule for 22 years.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.800
[Guest]: Because you know, dynasties can collapse at any time.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:36.920
[Guest]: I mean, even today you can have governments falling or, you know, countries changing overnight

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.960
[Guest]: that can happen.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.360
[Guest]: So certainly, you know, it's worth thinking that, you know, he must be doing something

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.160
[Guest]: right.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.360
[Guest]: And then it was in fact Anubhuti who introduced me to the work of this Corian Lefebvre.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.640
[Guest]: And she's written this fantastic, in which he makes this argument that, you know, this

00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:02.000
[Guest]: idea that we have of Jahangir being the sort of weakling controlled by his wife and not

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
[Guest]: really up to much.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.800
[Guest]: Well, it comes from one, the fact that there is four contemporary accounts of his reign

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.640
[Guest]: are limited only to him.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:16.560
[Guest]: There's only the Jahangir Nama because, you know, if the emperor is writing his own diary,

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.840
[Guest]: then your history, who else will dare to?

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:28.960
[Guest]: And then there is this propaganda that travels down almost 400 years unchanged via Shah Jahan,

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.440
[Guest]: his historians who come after Jahangir.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.280
[Guest]: And Shah Jahan has rebelled against his father in the last years of his reign and they never

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.880
[Guest]: quite make up.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:43.600
[Guest]: So once Shah Jahan ascends the throne, he has to justify his rebellion.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:49.840
[Guest]: And the only way he can, and he can't justify it by saying that, he can't say that, you

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.080
[Guest]: know, there was something that Jahangir was a bad king, because that would then justify

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.400
[Guest]: rebellions against him.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.560
[Guest]: You cannot rebel against the emperor.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:03.160
[Guest]: So he has to say that he was unable and unfit to be king because he was controlled by his

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.920
[Guest]: wife, Noor Jahan.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.640
[Guest]: And Noor Jahan survives 20 years after Jahangir goes and Shah Jahan keeps a very close eye

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:15.160
[Guest]: on her the entire time, keeps him virtually imprisoned in Lahore.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.520
[Guest]: She plays no public role whatsoever after that.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.760
[Guest]: And this idea, I mean, so much so is that there's a painting from Shah Jahan's reign

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:31.840
[Guest]: which has Akbar sitting in the middle and there's Shah Jahan to his left and Jahangir

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.120
[Guest]: to his right.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.880
[Guest]: And you know, Akbar is sort of blithely handing the crown over to Shah Jahan while Jahangir

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:44.280
[Amit Varma]: is sort of looking on, looking very sullen and a little sad.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.880
[Amit Varma]: And this was part of the sort of, so these painters and Shah Jahan's times who were making

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.880
[Amit Varma]: all these paintings are kind of like the IT cell of today, right?

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:57.560
[Amit Varma]: His IT cell, which is pushing out these false narratives, I guess.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.240
[Amit Varma]: And I guess another major work of that period, which everyone refers to is, of course, Abu

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.320
[Amit Varma]: Fazal's, you know, histories of Akbar, which are fairly hagiographic and he's just in awe

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.880
[Amit Varma]: of Akbar and he also doesn't like Jahangir very much.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.880
[Amit Varma]: So Jahangir doesn't come across as very well.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:16.560
[Amit Varma]: And then Jahangir, of course, gives him the ultimate bad book review by getting him beheaded

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:22.480
[Amit Varma]: and throwing his head into a latrine in one of the colorful details you've sort of described

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.480
[Amit Varma]: in your book.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.920
[Amit Varma]: You've also spoken in the past about how the way you looked at Jahangir Nama, the book

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.960
[Amit Varma]: changed over time, that at first you just looked at it as an honest diary, that every

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.480
[Amit Varma]: day the guy is writing a diary.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.440
[Amit Varma]: But then you realize there was probably a little more to it than that.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.880
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:46.760
[Guest]: So again, for this again, I mean, let it to Corinne Lefevre, who describes it as, as in

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.160
[Guest]: an essay, she calls it a model of imperial propaganda.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:56.440
[Guest]: And I, you know, because when you the first time you read it, I recommend it to everyone

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.600
[Guest]: now having read it, it's really very readable.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.600
[Guest]: It's entertaining.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.600
[Guest]: It's fluent.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.600
[Guest]: It's lucid.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.600
[Guest]: It's well written.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:10.160
[Guest]: It's got, it's got all kinds of emotions and, you know, action and adventure of all sorts.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:16.480
[Guest]: So so and Jahangir is a good writer and you know, like good writers, he can make you believe

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.160
[Guest]: him as the narrator.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:23.960
[Guest]: You know, he makes you sympathetic to him and he makes you be on his side.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:30.240
[Guest]: But it doesn't mean that he was not aware that this was a public document.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:37.280
[Guest]: And in fact, at some point, maybe about some midway through his reign, he has copies of

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:44.560
[Guest]: the of the Jahangir Nama that as it exists then made and distributed to kings around

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.680
[Guest]: the you know, in the in the region.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:51.440
[Guest]: And he says, I sent it out and I meant it this Jahangir Nama to be a model of how to

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.440
[Guest]: rule.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:58.560
[Guest]: So he's actually thinking of it in those terms.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:05.360
[Amit Varma]: And but all the human frailties that kind of come across like his drinking, for example,

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:11.160
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, I mean, is that sort of slipping through the cracks of his, you know, posturing

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.160
[Amit Varma]: as such?

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:19.400
[Amit Varma]: Or does he feel that, you know, I mean, how convinced are you of this view of, you know,

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.920
[Amit Varma]: having read both translations of the book?

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.920
[Guest]: How convinced?

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.880
[Guest]: I, you know, I would say that, let's say the drinking, right?

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:32.960
[Guest]: He's talking, he's talking about the drinking, he's very seemingly, very strangely frank

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.960
[Guest]: about it.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.440
[Guest]: You know, he says that I started drinking at 18.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.960
[Guest]: He tells the story in great detail, says I started drinking at 18.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.560
[Guest]: And I was out on a hunt.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:48.160
[Guest]: And, you know, somebody got him just a little sort of pint or half a pint of sweet wine.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.440
[Guest]: And he enjoyed it.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:55.640
[Guest]: And before you know it, he's drinking 20 goblets of double distilled liquor a day, 14 during

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.880
[Amit Varma]: the day and the remainder at night.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.960
[Amit Varma]: And then he goes on to elaborate that that's equivalent to six Hindustani seers, which

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.600
[Amit Varma]: is equivalent to one and a half Iranian morns.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.760
[Guest]: And he's a scientific man of measurement.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.120
[Guest]: Yeah, he likes, he likes to be clear.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.800
[Guest]: And then he says that I was drinking so much that in my hangovers, my hands used to shake

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.680
[Guest]: so much that I couldn't even hold the goblet.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.680
[Guest]: Somebody else would have to pour the liquor down my throat.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.440
[Guest]: And he says, I called the doctor and the doctor said to me that if you don't stop, you'll

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.160
[Guest]: be dead in in six months.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.000
[Guest]: And then he goes through his entire sort of de-addiction program.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.120
[Amit Varma]: That was also done very meticulously.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:37.240
[Guest]: He reduces it bit by bit, takes it down to six.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:42.800
[Guest]: And mixes his spirit with wine, like dilutes the spirit with wine in order to...

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:48.120
[Amit Varma]: So that's how you give up drinking, gentlemen, dilute your spirits with wine.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:52.400
[Guest]: And have a little opium during the day to get you through.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:58.720
[Guest]: So on the one hand, you know, there's, it seems as if like, oh, OK, if you look at it

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:05.200
[Guest]: from a sort of a modern 21st century perspective, it would appear like, oh, this is like a,

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.880
[Guest]: you know, sort of a confessional narrative.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:14.280
[Guest]: You know, how I almost died from drink, but then rose to be emperor.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.160
[Guest]: And again, because I'm not a historian, I don't want to say like too, I don't want to

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.160
[Guest]: say things with too much authority.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.760
[Guest]: But it's also like, you know, we're talking about the 17th century, drinking is not perhaps,

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:31.240
[Guest]: or at least addiction to drink is not viewed in the same way as it would be now.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.480
[Guest]: You know, there are there are problems with drinking then.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.880
[Guest]: I mean, there are there are sort of religious problems with it.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:44.600
[Guest]: But the problem of addiction doesn't exist, perhaps, in the way that, you know, that it

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.600
[Amit Varma]: might...

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.600
[Amit Varma]: That we perceive it now, that there is a stigma on.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:53.240
[Guest]: Yeah, so perhaps, you know, when he's writing, he's not writing against, you know, against

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.240
[Guest]: stigma.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:00.520
[Guest]: Or, you know, when he writes about ordering the execution of the assassination of Abul

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:05.400
[Guest]: Fazal, which he again writes with very frank and forthright way.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.880
[Guest]: He said this guy was forever making snide remarks about me to my father.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.360
[Guest]: So I knew I had to get rid of him.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:16.480
[Guest]: So I asked this Bir Singh Bundela if he would kindly waylay him.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.240
[Guest]: And he did and he sent me his head.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:24.360
[Guest]: And he says it as if, you know, it's a sort of cold blooded murder, really, that he's

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.480
[Guest]: ordered of, you know, a man that he must have known for most of his life.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:35.160
[Guest]: And his father's like really one of his closest friends and advisors.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:42.800
[Guest]: So but again, you know, and I was again discussing this with Anupooti, and who said that, you

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:49.240
[Guest]: know, again, this could be a, in a way, you know, is he saying here that, you know, this

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:55.720
[Guest]: is, let's say in the 17th century, if you are aiming to be king, or you are an emperor,

00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:00.960
[Guest]: the image that you project of yourself is of a man who will not let anyone stand between

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:06.680
[Guest]: him and the throne, a certain ruthlessness is necessary, you know, it has to have to

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.680
[Amit Varma]: be that.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.240
[Amit Varma]: And it's almost normalized.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:14.200
[Amit Varma]: So it's not even something that it seems remarkable and, you know, and we'll come to other, I

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:18.280
[Amit Varma]: want to ask you questions about a couple of things you raised like drinking and addiction,

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:24.400
[Amit Varma]: number one, and number two, about the sort of casual cruelty that can sometimes happen.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.720
[Amit Varma]: But you know, let's kind of go back to the narrative.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.560
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you start your book essentially with Akbar.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:36.480
[Amit Varma]: And a significant part of the story of Jahangir is really the story of Akbar wanting a son.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:42.440
[Amit Varma]: And just to, you know, set some context, we often think of, you know, when we, we look

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.640
[Amit Varma]: at history in a sense with the hindsight bias, it's happened, we take it for granted.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.300
[Amit Varma]: We take it for granted that the Mughal Empire was this great empire that lasted centuries.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:56.640
[Amit Varma]: But as you've pointed out, and as Ramakoti spoke about in her episode with me a few weeks

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.040
[Amit Varma]: earlier, it wasn't such a done deal, you know, so Babur came over, you know, he was, well,

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:06.080
[Amit Varma]: when he ascended to his throne, he came over, he conquered a bit of it, but then they lost

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.840
[Amit Varma]: it and Humayun was in exile for 15 years.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:14.080
[Amit Varma]: He was in fact in exile when he fell in love with Hamida Banu Begum in Afghanistan, I think,

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.680
[Amit Varma]: and he asked for her hand and she was like, who are you?

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.560
[Amit Varma]: You're, you know, you're running right now, you're not a king.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.520
[Amit Varma]: And anyway, so that kind of worked out and Humayun comes back and he's just taken over

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.360
[Amit Varma]: the kingdom and then he dies.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.880
[Amit Varma]: And Akbar ascends at 14.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:35.280
[Amit Varma]: And the empire that he leaves, that Jahangir is born into, is just an awesome, incredible

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.880
[Amit Varma]: empire.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.840
[Amit Varma]: And Jahangir is a first son.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.600
[Amit Varma]: There is no dynasty without at least one son coming along.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:49.280
[Amit Varma]: So you've written in your book about how badly Jahangir desires a son and when he is born,

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:54.040
[Amit Varma]: you write, quote, there is only so much self-control a joyful father can have.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.760
[Amit Varma]: Celebrations burst upon Agra like lightning upon a rain-ripe sky.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.520
[Amit Varma]: Heaps and heaps of gold were scattered, says one writer.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.520
[Amit Varma]: Prisoners and dungeons across the empire were set free.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.520
[Amit Varma]: For days, poets composed odes to the prince, stop quote.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:13.280
[Amit Varma]: And then you quote Abu Fazl, Akbar's infamous biographer, quote, the auspicious birth of

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.760
[Amit Varma]: the world illuminating pearl of the mansion of dominion and fortune, the night gleaming

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:24.800
[Amit Varma]: jewel of the casket of greatness and glory, namely of Prince Sultan Salim, stop quote.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.040
[Amit Varma]: So Akbar wanted the son so badly and he loves his son so much.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:35.400
[Amit Varma]: And yet there is such a sort of tension here because a son inevitably, no matter what he

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.320
[Amit Varma]: is, will be a disappointment to his father.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.200
[Guest]: I mean, not any son and any father, but you know, this was Akbar.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.720
[Guest]: So Akbar really, I mean, who could have not disappointed him?

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:50.320
[Guest]: It's not, you know, I wouldn't want to be, I wouldn't have wanted to be in Salim's place.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.760
[Guest]: It was because this guy, like Akbar really is extraordinary.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:32:00.520
[Guest]: You know, he is, I mean, there is a reason why he shines brighter than other people in

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.520
[Guest]: history.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:07.440
[Guest]: And there are some people like that who really accomplished far more in one lifetime than

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.880
[Guest]: most people could in 10.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:15.760
[Guest]: And there's no, I mean, when he becomes whatever, I mean, emperor, but emperor of what?

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.280
[Guest]: You know, basically of Delhi, he's not even in Delhi, he's still in Punjab.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:27.480
[Guest]: He's there still he and Beram Khan is still in pursuit of Sikandar Sur and Mayun slips

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:33.200
[Guest]: and falls and breaks his head and Akbar is suddenly king, but there's no reason for him

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.200
[Guest]: to remain.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:40.520
[Guest]: There's loads of competition, and not least from him, who is one of the, you know, great

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:48.080
[Guest]: generals of that time and has fought several battles and never lost one and is far more

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:56.880
[Guest]: experienced and has a big, huge army and lots of elephants and he's primed to take over,

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.360
[Guest]: you know, and they face each other in Panipat.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:06.000
[Guest]: And there, I mean, the battle from, you know, whatever I've read of it, it sort of, it was

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.360
[Guest]: a fairly equal battle.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:14.120
[Guest]: And then he does have a stroke of luck because Hemu is struck in the eye with an arrow and

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.280
[Guest]: he and he falls.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:21.760
[Guest]: And the logic of battles at the time was if the leader collapses, or the commander collapses,

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:26.800
[Guest]: the army collapses, you know, which is really very inefficient, but that's how it was.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:32.600
[Guest]: So he, you know, so Hemu collapsed and so did the rest of his army.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:37.920
[Guest]: And so then, you know, that battle is won, you know, partly by luck.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:43.000
[Guest]: But after that, it's not I mean, luck doesn't get him through, you know, the next 50 odd

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:51.240
[Guest]: years that he lives and goes from strength to strength to strength, sorting down rebellion

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.560
[Guest]: after rebellion after rebellion.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.720
[Guest]: And so many people are vying for power.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.560
[Guest]: And you know, not only is he doing that, not only is he increasing his physical geography

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:07.000
[Guest]: of his realm, just sort of going from one conquest to another, he's also changing its

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
[Guest]: systems.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.800
[Guest]: So he's back from, you know, conquering Gujarat and he sits down, he says, now let's rethink

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.560
[Guest]: our revenue model or our, you know, administration or how we organize the Mansabdars.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.400
[Guest]: He's very interested in all of that.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:23.800
[Guest]: Then he's also doing this, you know, he's got these great translation projects, he's

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.640
[Guest]: got building projects, he's got music and all of that.

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:32.120
[Guest]: I mean, you know, so all of this is going on at the same time.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:37.480
[Guest]: This is a man who, I mean, reading about him, you feel a little exhausted.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.680
[Guest]: You know, he just never stops.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:46.000
[Amit Varma]: It must be like literally a one in a millennium chance that all of these qualities converge

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.480
[Amit Varma]: upon one person.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.760
[Amit Varma]: He fits the role of the great conqueror.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:57.080
[Amit Varma]: He's also a great public policy man to use modern terminology where he's reforming his

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.920
[Amit Varma]: tax revenue systems and his systems of governance and all of that.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.240
[Amit Varma]: At the same time, he's a great patron of the arts, partly with the help of all these painters

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:10.400
[Amit Varma]: whom Arjun brought back from Persia famously and which tradition, which is Sanjay Hangeer,

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.040
[Amit Varma]: of course, continues to great with great success.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.480
[Amit Varma]: And also he is a serious intellectual.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.840
[Amit Varma]: He's thinking about religion, all of these different ideas, trying to weave these strands

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.880
[Amit Varma]: together.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:27.280
[Amit Varma]: And he finally has a son and the son sits around drinking all day and examining animals

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:33.160
[Amit Varma]: and shows no interest in conquest, keeps making excuses to kind of, I mean, one of the themes

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.840
[Amit Varma]: that ran through your book is that your book is full of basically a father sending a son

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.440
[Amit Varma]: to conquer something or the other.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.440
[Amit Varma]: Quite often the decan and the son is making excuses and he's going here and he's going

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:48.120
[Amit Varma]: there and you know, Akbar sends all his kids to do this and they all kind of make a mess

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.320
[Amit Varma]: of it.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:56.600
[Amit Varma]: And Jahangir then sends, you know, eventually Khurram has a semi success of sorts.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:02.320
[Amit Varma]: And I was kind of interested by the, you know, again, just to talk a little bit about drinking

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:07.400
[Amit Varma]: and addiction, because as we were, you know, chatting while coming here, I was sort of

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.600
[Amit Varma]: a professional poker player for five years.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:16.600
[Amit Varma]: I've seen people addicted to gambling, I've written columns about addiction and it kind

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:21.720
[Amit Varma]: of and I'm again just thinking aloud and tell me what your response is that I think a lot

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:26.960
[Amit Varma]: of people have addictive personalities, but what they're addicted to is not specifically

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:32.320
[Amit Varma]: thing A or thing B or activity C, it's dopamine to the brain.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.040
[Amit Varma]: And the question is, where do you get that dopamine from?

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.800
[Amit Varma]: And in modern times, it could be safe from gambling, you push chips forward, you get

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.960
[Amit Varma]: dopamine rush to your head, it could be from playing online chess, which I think I might

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.360
[Amit Varma]: have been addicted to online chess, or it could come largely from social media as well.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:53.400
[Amit Varma]: In today's day and time, where you know, every notification gives you a hit every like gives

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.020
[Amit Varma]: you a dopamine hit.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:59.920
[Amit Varma]: But in those times, like when I try to imagine how are people spending their time all day,

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:04.200
[Amit Varma]: reading is not so common, there is no television, there are no movies, there is perhaps thankfully

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.200
[Amit Varma]: no cricket or people would be impaled, umpires would be impaled upon cricket fields.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.960
[Amit Varma]: But there is a lot of wine and there's a lot of variety of wine.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:16.720
[Amit Varma]: So if people are going to get addicted, they will get addicted to that and all of Akbar's

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:21.040
[Amit Varma]: children get addicted to it, you know, Murad and Dhani are the other two kids, they kind

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:27.040
[Amit Varma]: of so you know, what sort of your response to that and also just thinking about taking

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.560
[Amit Varma]: off from that?

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:35.000
[Amit Varma]: What's a typical day like in the life of, let's say somebody living under Akbar or under

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.720
[Amit Varma]: Jahangir?

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, what are they doing?

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.400
[Amit Varma]: How are they spending their time?

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.400
[Amit Varma]: How do they?

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I know it's a very nice question, which historians can scoff at me for asking.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:52.760
[Guest]: Well, to the first part, we're sure, yeah, I mean, wine was plentifully obviously available.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:58.000
[Guest]: And it wasn't just, you know, Akbar's sons who were addicted, but you know, the nobility

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.520
[Guest]: generally and the sons of the nobility generally like even you know, Man Singh's son, I think

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:09.040
[Guest]: he has, you know, four or five sons and of that, I think at least two or three die of

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.040
[Guest]: drinking.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:16.520
[Guest]: And the Akbar Nama, Jahangir Nama, they're littered with the accounts of these sort of,

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:22.080
[Guest]: in fact, littered with corpses of men who have perished from drink.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.680
[Guest]: But I suppose there was also, they have one or two alternatives.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.000
[Guest]: Hunting was one.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.600
[Guest]: Certainly, Jahangir, you could almost say addicted to it.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:37.280
[Guest]: He does a census at one point asking, he wants to calculate how many animals he's killed

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.640
[Guest]: between the age of 12 and about 50 or so that he is when he orders the census.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:48.640
[Guest]: And the amount comes to the rather obscene amount of 17,167 animals.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.120
[Amit Varma]: Out of which you mentioned 10,000 are pigeons.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:59.000
[Guest]: Yes, I was very pleased to learn this because it sort of, it makes me feel a little bit

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
[Guest]: better.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.520
[Guest]: And 86, I think, were lions.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:09.360
[Guest]: So there was at least one snake, as we know, if you count that.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.360
[Guest]: And one rabbit.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.360
[Guest]: And one rabbit.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:15.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it could be argued that the rabbit would have died anyway.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.560
[Guest]: Yeah, or maybe the rabbit escaped.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.560
[Amit Varma]: Or the rabbit fell out.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, the rabbit fell out of the...

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.560
[Amit Varma]: The rabbit fell out.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.560
[Guest]: Maybe the rabbit just...

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:30.160
[Amit Varma]: But a rabbit with severe post-traumatic stress disorder, if it's gone inside and outside.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:35.880
[Guest]: And so, you know, definitely that and I think the other thing, I mean, the Mughals do exhibit

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:42.560
[Guest]: a sense of tendency, not just towards addiction, but to kind of, you know, obsessive compulsive

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:48.520
[Guest]: sort of OCD type of behavior when it comes to record keeping amongst other things.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:55.400
[Guest]: You know, they just, everything is noted down like in just ridiculous detail.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:02.920
[Guest]: You know how, not just the contents of the treasury, but, you know, the ranks of elephants,

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:10.400
[Guest]: the ranks of mules, the, you know, the different sort of guns in the artillery, the, you know,

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:15.120
[Guest]: I mean, every conceivable thing is noted down and filed.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:22.480
[Guest]: So, you know, and like this one of these Englishmen who travels there says that everything that

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:29.560
[Guest]: happens during the day in the emperor's life is written down by writers, including what

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:36.440
[Guest]: he eats, you know, and his sort of going to the necessity, all of that is meticulously

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.440
[Guest]: recorded.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:42.680
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting, you seem to be indicating that this is not just a matter of, you know,

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:45.880
[Amit Varma]: good efficient practice that you record everything, but there's something obsessive compulsive

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.880
[Amit Varma]: about it.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:52.040
[Amit Varma]: So again, would go back to the thing of this also creates hits of dopamine in some way.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:56.840
[Guest]: It seems to me, because you're like, why would you want such minute details of, you know,

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.840
[Guest]: recording?

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:03.240
[Guest]: And then it's very, very professionally done, you know, that I think there are 14 recorders

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:09.800
[Guest]: who work in shifts over the course of, you know, one week, two at a time, so that if

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.040
[Guest]: one misses something out, the other one catches it.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:16.480
[Guest]: I mean, it's a professional meticulous enterprise.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:23.840
[Guest]: So that would be another way of sort of getting the dopamine hits.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:31.040
[Guest]: So but while you know, the daily life of the emperor was recorded in such minute detail,

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:37.920
[Guest]: daily life of an ordinary person is more difficult to access.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:46.760
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, you get glimpses, you know, you get glimpses of, let's say in the in the

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:53.560
[Guest]: court, when you know, you have descriptions of how the court is arranged and how people

00:41:53.560 --> 00:42:01.840
[Guest]: come and present their grievances or their demands or you know, what they what they want

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:08.160
[Guest]: to get, you get you get glimpses of the kind of gossip and talk that might be circulating

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.840
[Guest]: in the towns around the courts from some of these European writers.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:18.680
[Guest]: And I think I particularly liked what he said, Thomas Rowe is very shocked, because he says

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.840
[Guest]: that, you know, whenever Jahangir makes a pronouncement, the minute he said it, it's,

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:29.000
[Guest]: he says it's available for every rascal on the street to discuss and criticize.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.280
[Guest]: And he says, you know, that Jahangir is really locked in the schedule that he has of his

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:40.280
[Guest]: pre-dawn appearance and his, you know, the public darbar.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:47.880
[Guest]: And he says, just as the people are his slaves, so is he in a kind of reciprocal bondage with

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.880
[Guest]: them.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.720
[Guest]: So he can't deviate from his routine very much.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.720
[Amit Varma]: And the daily situation is there's a pre-dawn sort of darbar, he comes out on the balcony

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.760
[Amit Varma]: in the same much like Amitabh Bachchan today, I guess.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.200
[Amit Varma]: And then he takes a nap for two hours, and then he'll have his breakfast and all that

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.120
[Amit Varma]: with whatever with opium morning hit of opium.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.080
[Amit Varma]: And then he has two darbars a day, you said one, you know, one before lunch, one after

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:18.160
[Amit Varma]: lunch and it's it all sounds I mean, it would drive me to drink if I had to work so hard.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:26.000
[Amit Varma]: I was also, you know, struck by how, you know, like you point out at one time that one of

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.960
[Amit Varma]: the most common lines in Jahangir Nama is I summon the painters.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:36.880
[Amit Varma]: And it almost strikes me that he's almost like an Instagrammer, except a few centuries

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.440
[Amit Varma]: before Instagram.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.000
[Amit Varma]: So he can't whip out a smartphone and capture something.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.640
[Amit Varma]: So whenever he wants to capture something, he'll do it the royal way, send for his painters

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:49.400
[Amit Varma]: and you know, a glacial pace Instagram.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.960
[Amit Varma]: And you point to how the only life painting of a dodo really came from his court, which

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:58.320
[Amit Varma]: you reproduced in one of your talks, and it's a shockingly ugly bird.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.800
[Amit Varma]: What can one say of this?

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:04.280
[Amit Varma]: And you also point out and there's another painting that, you know, you showed in one

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:09.240
[Amit Varma]: of your slideshows, which is on YouTube, which I encourage people to check out, where you

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:13.640
[Amit Varma]: showed this painting of this guy called Inayat Khan, a guy who was basically fell very ill

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:18.680
[Amit Varma]: and was practically emaciated and, you know, literally bones jutting out and he comes to

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:24.120
[Amit Varma]: Jahangir and ask for leave or whatever and Jahangir says fine, but first Instagram and

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:28.440
[Amit Varma]: he summons a painter and, and that painting seems very different from all other Mughal

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:33.000
[Amit Varma]: miniatures and all this almost like, like a Chittu Prashad painting of the Bengal famine,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, very stark and, and this is how when you were researching this, how did you

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.280
[Amit Varma]: sort of access the paintings?

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:43.600
[Amit Varma]: Like, how do you get context of what these paintings are and what's going on here?

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:48.800
[Guest]: Like if one of the listeners of the show wants to do that for himself, is there a way to

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.800
[Guest]: do that online?

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.080
[Guest]: Yeah, many of these are available online.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.360
[Guest]: If you look through, you know, through the museum, many of the museums put up their collections

00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:02.800
[Guest]: online to view and, and also Jahangir talks about some of these things in the Jahangir

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.800
[Guest]: Nama.

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.560
[Guest]: So this Inayat Khan story he tells, you know, so then you know that this, this painting

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.560
[Guest]: exists.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:13.080
[Guest]: Then he talks about the zebra that comes to his court that he has, that he has painted

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.080
[Guest]: and he's not sure if the stripes are real or not.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.240
[Amit Varma]: So you get someone to try and wash the stripes off.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.720
[Guest]: So you know that these paintings are there.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.520
[Guest]: So yes, I mean, there are, there are hints in the Jahangir Nama itself.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:32.080
[Guest]: Then of course, you know, from reading other writers, modern writers who talk about, particularly

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.640
[Guest]: Ebba Koch has written about, you know, art in Jahangir's time.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:39.560
[Guest]: Then there's a writer called Asfar Moin who's also done a lot of very, very interesting

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:44.360
[Guest]: sort of close readings of certain paintings made during his time.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:49.680
[Guest]: But I agree with you that Inayat Khan painting for me also was quite, both shocking in its

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:56.960
[Guest]: content and in the fact that it, it is so different from anything that I have seen of,

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.720
[Guest]: you know, there's something very sort of modern about it.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:06.360
[Guest]: You know, it seems very contemporary, it could have been made and, and, and very haunting

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.360
[Guest]: and very not beautiful.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.880
[Amit Varma]: And the guy actually died shortly after the painting.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:15.640
[Guest]: He died the day after or something, within a day or two, he died.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:20.360
[Guest]: So it is, it is really, it is a representation of death.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.520
[Guest]: And it's, it's absolutely real.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:27.840
[Guest]: There's no, there's, there's, there's no sort of prettification, there's no, there's no

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.840
[Guest]: soft edges.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.720
[Guest]: It's, it's just his.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:37.640
[Amit Varma]: Another very sort of interesting and endearing quality of Jahangir is sort of this endless

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:42.680
[Amit Varma]: curiosity about the natural world, which made me feel a little ashamed because, you know,

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:47.800
[Amit Varma]: I don't know if it's true of you, but I feel jaded about a lot of things, the wonder and

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.840
[Amit Varma]: awe of, you know, discovering new things and seeing something for the first time.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.040
[Amit Varma]: And just wondering how does that work?

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.400
[Amit Varma]: It's just not there in me anymore.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.440
[Amit Varma]: And you'd imagine a Mughal emperor would be far more jaded.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:05.560
[Amit Varma]: And yet you have him telling his men to milk a lion, because he wants to see how that processes,

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.520
[Amit Varma]: you have the snake and the rabbit story.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:13.360
[Amit Varma]: There's another story where he finds two different kinds of goats, you pointed out, and he gets

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.640
[Amit Varma]: them to mate because he wants to see what will come out of it at the same time using

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.880
[Amit Varma]: that I'm sure they would be tasty.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:25.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, there's another story about how a dog gives bites an elephant and the

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.360
[Amit Varma]: elephant dies of rabies.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:31.280
[Amit Varma]: And Jahangir is like, yeah, there's something there, but he doesn't really explore it further.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.960
[Amit Varma]: But how can something so small attack something so big?

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:40.400
[Amit Varma]: And my another story that actually ranks up there with the snake and the rabbit story

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.000
[Amit Varma]: is my favorite is a lion and the goat story.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.480
[Amit Varma]: Where Khosrow's son, the Dabar Baksh gives him, you know, a lion and a goat who are coexisting

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.320
[Amit Varma]: in a cage.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.120
[Amit Varma]: And he's curious about what kind of lion is this?

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.840
[Amit Varma]: Will this work with any other goat?

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:59.480
[Amit Varma]: He gets a goat taken out, look like goat is put in, immediately killed, puts in a sheep,

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.760
[Amit Varma]: immediately killed.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:05.120
[Amit Varma]: And then the same goat is put back in and the lion treats it warmly and starts cuddling

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.120
[Amit Varma]: up with it.

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:10.920
[Guest]: Yeah, it's just amazing the stories from his time.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:16.440
[Guest]: And he does that I think his curiosity is one of the most endearing things about him.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:22.560
[Guest]: Without his curiosity, you know, he would be he would not because there are very I mean,

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:29.440
[Guest]: he has terrible, terrible cruelties and terrible sort of, I mean, there are many things about

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.200
[Guest]: him that are not attractive.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:37.280
[Guest]: But this this is real appreciation of beauty and his boundless curiosity, like you said,

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:42.920
[Guest]: really make him and make his Jhangir Nama both so compelling, you know, as both as a

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.120
[Guest]: man and as a book.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.640
[Guest]: And I think in one sense, I suppose you get, you know, reading it, the other thing you

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:53.480
[Guest]: realize is that the world was far less known at that time, you know, things were still

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.480
[Guest]: new.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:01.320
[Guest]: You know, I mean, atlases and maps and globes were still like new things.

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:08.480
[Guest]: And you know, there's this story of about Thomas Rowe, in fact, and at some point, Thomas

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:13.080
[Guest]: Rowe presents Jhangir with an atlas.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:17.280
[Guest]: And at first, Jhangir is quite curious about it.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.240
[Guest]: And then he sends it back within a couple of days.

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:27.240
[Guest]: And Thomas Rowe realizes that the reason he's done this is because, you know, in those atlases

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:32.560
[Guest]: and even now in an atlas, as they're made, India appears much smaller than Europe, you

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:37.360
[Guest]: know, so he doesn't doesn't like the idea of his kingdom being smaller than any.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.720
[Guest]: He's the emperor of the world, you know.

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.320
[Guest]: So, so the world is not fully known.

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:49.360
[Guest]: There's this amazing little bit where one of these other British Englishmen in his court

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:53.440
[Guest]: is William Hawkins, who spent about four or five years there.

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.000
[Guest]: And he he's come his last voyage was in the West Indies.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.080
[Guest]: And Jhangir says to him, you know, I've heard of the West Indies.

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.040
[Guest]: I wasn't sure if it was a real place.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.680
[Guest]: You know, I wasn't sure if it actually existed.

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.680
[Guest]: What is it?

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.000
[Guest]: And so, you know, so he tells him all about it.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:13.520
[Guest]: And even, forget Jhangir, there's this Italian chap who's coming to India, Pietro Della

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.520
[Guest]: Valle.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.280
[Guest]: And he's coming and on the way, you know, he talks about how he and the captain are

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.280
[Guest]: discussing unicorns.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.360
[Guest]: And they're not discussing whether or not unicorns exist.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:24.760
[Guest]: They're discussing on which latitude and longitude unicorns are found.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:33.160
[Guest]: So the world is far more wonderful in some ways and full of wonder than it is today.

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:35.920
[Guest]: There's things still to be discovered.

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:40.320
[Guest]: And that said, you know, it can also be very frustrating sometimes when you're reading

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:46.320
[Guest]: what Jhangir and his curiosities, because the curiosity stops and it stops almost as

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.400
[Guest]: if there's this blind spot.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:54.360
[Guest]: You know, like the thing you mentioned about the dog who gives, infects the elephant, right?

00:50:54.360 --> 00:51:00.120
[Guest]: And Jhangir is like, oh, how can such a small creature make such a large creature ill?

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:08.520
[Guest]: And I just want to sort of shout out to him across the centuries, this is how infection

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:09.520
[Guest]: works.

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.520
[Guest]: You know, this is malaria.

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:14.400
[Amit Varma]: There's literally no way he can have the intellectual tools.

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.960
[Guest]: There's no way, exactly.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:22.400
[Guest]: So you realize how much has changed, you know, how easy it is for us to make that connection

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.960
[Guest]: and how almost impossible it is for him.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:31.600
[Guest]: Or even when, you know, there's another point of meteor, meteor falls somewhere nearby in

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:39.200
[Guest]: Jalandhar and everyone is very excited, of course, and Jhangir wants to see this metal.

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.200
[Guest]: But again, there's this sort of curtain that falls.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:48.600
[Guest]: It's not, you know, beyond sort of making some knives and swords out of it.

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:53.280
[Guest]: There's no interrogation of what is this, where does it come from?

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:59.400
[Guest]: You know, even though astrology and astronomy are both sort of the highly developed skills

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:06.200
[Guest]: and passions at the time, natural meteor falling, just somehow you can, it's there it is.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:10.440
[Guest]: You make your sword out of it and then it's finished.

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.360
[Guest]: It's just a full stop.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:16.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you quote an Englishman named Henry Beveridge saying that Jhangir would have been

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:21.360
[Amit Varma]: a better and happier man as a head of a natural history museum, rather than, you know, an

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.360
[Amit Varma]: imperial emperor.

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:27.280
[Amit Varma]: Tell me also about, I mean, I mean, you know, you live in Delhi and we keep talking about

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.640
[Amit Varma]: the air quality index of Delhi and all that.

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:35.080
[Amit Varma]: How many people know that Jhangir was one of the pioneers of air quality index?

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:39.120
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about his efforts at measuring pollution in Gujarat.

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.440
[Guest]: Yeah, so he went to Gujarat.

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:46.400
[Guest]: He had been in Mandu for a while and he'd really enjoyed it.

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:50.960
[Guest]: And he then he was going up to Ahmedabad and he'd heard a great, great thing about Ahmedabad.

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:56.120
[Guest]: He'd heard of, he was looking forward to going there.

00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:00.360
[Guest]: And he arrived and immediately, almost immediately, he begins to complain.

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.880
[Guest]: He said, you know, what is this place?

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.560
[Guest]: It's a dust heap, he calls it.

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:06.960
[Guest]: And he says the air is just poisonous.

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:10.360
[Guest]: And he can't leave because there's a plague that's broken out in Agra.

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:14.480
[Guest]: So he can't go back to Agra and he's just more or less trapped.

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.080
[Guest]: And Ahmedabad, he falls ill.

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:18.080
[Guest]: He has to eat khichdi.

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.120
[Guest]: He says, I've not eaten khichdi since I was a child.

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:23.240
[Guest]: And I really had hoped I would never have to eat it again.

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.120
[Guest]: But here I am.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:30.720
[Guest]: And so he, so anyway, to distract himself and to confirm his own theory, he orders this

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.720
[Guest]: experiment.

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:39.960
[Guest]: He has two sheep skinned and hung up, one just outside Ahmedabad and one in Mahmoodabad.

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:40.960
[Amit Varma]: And he has...

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:41.960
[Amit Varma]: Mahmoodabad in UP, of course.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:45.760
[Guest]: In UP, of course, yeah.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:50.120
[Guest]: And so, and the time, how long it takes for the sheep to start rotting.

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:55.240
[Guest]: And Jahangir is very right, because the one in Ahmedabad starts to rot, I think, in eight

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.880
[Guest]: hours or so.

00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:00.600
[Guest]: And the one in UP lasts six hours longer.

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.840
[Guest]: And it lasts, it rots after 14 hours.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:10.000
[Amit Varma]: So the rotting sheep air quality index is quite...

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.320
[Amit Varma]: And another big nugget for my listeners, William Hawkins, who Parvati just mentioned, of course,

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.640
[Amit Varma]: invented the modern pressure cooker.

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.640
[Amit Varma]: I'm just kidding.

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:20.640
[Amit Varma]: He didn't.

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:26.200
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of, you know, you mentioned his cruelty earlier and a lot of it, you know,

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.480
[Amit Varma]: at one hand, when it comes to animals, for example, of course, he has this curiosity.

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.320
[Amit Varma]: He kills a snake trying to make it eat a rabbit.

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:36.000
[Amit Varma]: But he also, for example, you mentioned how someone gives him an elephant and it's night

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.640
[Amit Varma]: and the elephant needs to be bathed and he's feeling bad that all the water will be too

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:40.640
[Amit Varma]: cold.

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.920
[Amit Varma]: So the water is heated for the elephant to take a bath in.

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.560
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, he can be incredibly cruel.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:50.240
[Amit Varma]: Like one example you point out is, and we'll of course, you know, talk about Khusrow and

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.600
[Amit Varma]: that whole politics later.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:55.280
[Amit Varma]: Khusrow is his elder son who rebels against him and he chases him.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:59.480
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, you know, while chasing him, he makes sacrifices like he doesn't take his

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:00.680
[Amit Varma]: morning dose of opium.

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:05.480
[Amit Varma]: He just runs off after Khusrow and then he reaches Lahore where there is biryani spread

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.960
[Amit Varma]: out for him and he notes in the Jahangir Nama that I would have loved to have the biryani

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:13.840
[Amit Varma]: but work awaits, possibly the only such sacrifice he made in his career.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.680
[Guest]: He has one bite per man, then he has to run.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:23.560
[Amit Varma]: And then he has to run after, you know, and so the cruelty, you know, the great example

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:28.520
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, really stuck with me and I was thinking about that was of Khusrow's lieutenants,

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.520
[Amit Varma]: Hussain Baig and Abdul Rahim.

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:33.840
[Amit Varma]: And I'll quote from your book here, quote, Hussain Baig and Abdul Rahim.

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.760
[Amit Varma]: This is after they've been captured and the rebellion has failed.

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:41.480
[Amit Varma]: Quote, Hussain Baig and Abdul Rahim were wrapped naked in animal skin.

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:46.960
[Amit Varma]: The badakshi, that's Hussain Baig, was stuffed into a freshly killed ox, Abdul Rahim into

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:50.400
[Amit Varma]: a donkey and mounted backwards on asses.

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.080
[Amit Varma]: They were paraded through the city.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:57.560
[Amit Varma]: Hussain Baig died of suffocation, Abdul Rahim, perhaps because donkey skin is more porous,

00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:03.280
[Amit Varma]: perhaps because he had supporters in the crowd who gave him water, survived, stop quote.

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:07.600
[Amit Varma]: And this is one just in terms of imagination, this seems crazy.

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:12.280
[Amit Varma]: But what also made me sort of laugh out loud was that Abdul Rahim was later reinstated

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:16.480
[Amit Varma]: and Jahangir would call him donkey.

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:21.240
[Amit Varma]: So and you know, and then the contrast to this is for another place you mentioned about

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:26.000
[Amit Varma]: how he once caught fish and he released them back into the water with pearls pinned to

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000
[Amit Varma]: their noses.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Why was this?

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.000
[Guest]: God knows he was the emperor, he could do what he liked.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000
[Guest]: I really don't know.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
[Guest]: It just was.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:41.880
[Guest]: Actually, that was one of those moments that struck me, you know, as as because some of

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:46.560
[Guest]: the reading of the Jahangir and getting to sort of know him as much as possible to, you

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:54.400
[Guest]: know, know a character from history was getting to know what it is to have almost limitless

00:56:54.400 --> 00:57:00.640
[Guest]: power, you know, and you and you start asking yourself in the course of it, like, if I had

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.840
[Guest]: this kind of power, what would I do?

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.040
[Guest]: And would I not go a little mad?

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.080
[Guest]: You know, and I think it would be almost impossible not to.

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:15.200
[Guest]: So so if you have the power to release fish with pearls in their noses, I suppose why

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.200
[Amit Varma]: not?

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I think so.

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.840
[Amit Varma]: And there is there is also the sense, as you point out, that there are parts of the book

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:24.400
[Amit Varma]: where even Jahangir is surprised by the extent of his own power, such as when he's in court

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:28.200
[Amit Varma]: and a supplicant comes and says that I want to marry this widow, can you please persuade

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:29.200
[Amit Varma]: her?

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.680
[Amit Varma]: Then the guy says that I would jump from the highest tower to show my love and Jahangir

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.840
[Amit Varma]: says, OK, jump from there.

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.160
[Amit Varma]: And he points to a nearby thing and the guy runs and he jumps and dies.

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:39.400
[Amit Varma]: And Jahangir is like, what have what just happened?

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:42.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, and that is the power of the emperor.

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:50.480
[Amit Varma]: So how can it and despite that it you know, it's very hard one power because, you know,

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.840
[Amit Varma]: before he becomes emperor, which is not a done deal.

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:56.920
[Amit Varma]: And we've already sort of discussed about both how he, Murad and Daniyal, the three

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.160
[Amit Varma]: brothers were disappointments to their father.

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:03.760
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, when he was pissed off at Jahangir, Akbar looked at Murad and then later Murad

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:09.680
[Amit Varma]: died of drink and he looked at Daniyal and Daniyal also died of drink in a fairly crazy

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.680
[Amit Varma]: incident.

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:15.000
[Amit Varma]: And then he turns to his grandchildren and he looks at Jahangir's sons.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.800
[Amit Varma]: And in particular, Khosrow is a person, Khosrow is about 17 or 18 at the time.

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.520
[Amit Varma]: And he's thinking of propping him up.

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:24.320
[Amit Varma]: And what's that rivalry like?

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:29.200
[Guest]: Well, I mean, you know, I don't know, but I can only imagine what it must have been

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.200
[Guest]: like.

00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.200
[Guest]: Because again, there are only hints, you know, for this.

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:39.040
[Guest]: Like, you know, Abul Fazal says, for example, cryptically, that the emperor always preferred

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.800
[Guest]: his grandsons to his sons.

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:49.400
[Guest]: And there's also, you know, just this, just a sort of stray fact that Akbar's grandsons

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.960
[Guest]: called him Shah Baba, you know, King Father.

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:58.400
[Guest]: And their father, Jahangir was Shahbhai, the king brother.

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:06.040
[Guest]: So this sort of hierarchy was very clearly, you know, the power was very clearly flowing

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:12.840
[Guest]: down from Akbar down to everyone below was sort of on a similar plane.

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:19.680
[Guest]: And so what it must have been like for Jahangir, I mean, it certainly it couldn't have been

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:27.240
[Guest]: easy to have to know that, you know, your own son is preferred over you for the throne.

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:35.600
[Guest]: And but it's not so much through him that we get to see how much tension there must

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.600
[Guest]: have been.

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:42.960
[Guest]: But through, you know, Khosrow's poor mother, who's Manbhai, who's also Man Singh's sister

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:45.880
[Guest]: and Jahangir's first wife.

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:50.520
[Guest]: And at some point, she commits suicide.

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:53.360
[Guest]: She overdoses on opium and dies.

00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:55.520
[Guest]: And Jahangir writes about it again in the Jahangir Nama.

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.360
[Guest]: And he says, and he blames Khosrow.

00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:04.280
[Guest]: He says, you know, she was so upset with Khosrow because he was behaving badly that she couldn't

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.760
[Guest]: take it and she killed herself.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:14.800
[Guest]: And meanwhile, in the Akbar Nama, the blame falls squarely on Jahangir because, you know,

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:21.920
[Guest]: the Akbar Nama says that Jahangir treated her so badly and upset her so much that she

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.920
[Guest]: killed herself.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:29.000
[Guest]: And of course, there's also the theory and the suggestion that she and in the family,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.040
[Guest]: there was a kind of manic depression that ran in the family.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:37.240
[Guest]: So, you know, she may also have been suffering from a depression of some sort, but still

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.880
[Guest]: there would, you know, there would have to be triggered.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.920
[Guest]: And so it certainly can't have been fun.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:49.320
[Guest]: And you know, it's obviously an increasingly, increasingly dysfunctional family.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:54.280
[Amit Varma]: Your husband is fighting with your son who is backed by your father-in-law.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.280
[Guest]: For the throne, for the empire of all Hindustan.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.240
[Amit Varma]: And just again, you know, as we learn from Thomas Rose's writings, and I think William

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.760
[Amit Varma]: Hawkins, inventor of the pressure cooker, estimated that while the Mughal Empire was

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:10.440
[Amit Varma]: worth 56 million, England was half a million.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.440
[Amit Varma]: So that was a difference.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.800
[Amit Varma]: This was a mighty empire.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.880
[Amit Varma]: There was a lot at stake.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:18.480
[Amit Varma]: And also within Mughal dynasties, the way succession worked is it didn't automatically

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.840
[Amit Varma]: go to the eldest son, like it does in some dynasties.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.800
[Amit Varma]: You know, there weren't any rules like that.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.360
[Amit Varma]: So it was up for grabs.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.000
[Amit Varma]: And of course, in Akbar's times, it was relatively gentle.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.960
[Amit Varma]: The worst you might do what Jahangir at one point did to Khosrow was blind him because

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.240
[Amit Varma]: blind people, according to Islam, cannot ascend the throne.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.280
[Amit Varma]: But Shah Jahan basically just killed off all contenders.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:47.440
[Amit Varma]: And that sort of became more and more vicious, you know, one sort of counterfactual, if you'll

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:52.440
[Amit Varma]: sort of indulge me in this is what I've always wondered is one, it seems clear to me that

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:58.920
[Amit Varma]: Khosrow was admired and idolized by a lot of people possibly seems to be have been a

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.520
[Amit Varma]: lot more powerful than Jahangir and certainly had the support of all the women in the court,

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:08.600
[Amit Varma]: all the sisters and mothers and aunts who are so powerful and was respected by them

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:14.080
[Amit Varma]: and feared by his own brother Khurram, the later Shah Jahan, who had him sort of put

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:19.000
[Amit Varma]: to death and Khosrow, you could say had numerous chances to ascend to the throne one directly

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.000
[Amit Varma]: after Akbar or two just as Jahangir's son after Jahangir.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, he got like many second, there were many second acts in his life, and none

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.840
[Amit Varma]: of them worked out.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:36.520
[Amit Varma]: The counterfactual here is that what if Khosrow does become emperor, and therefore neither

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.600
[Amit Varma]: Jahangir nor Shah Jahan ever kind of become emperor.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.560
[Amit Varma]: Is there a drastic difference to history?

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Or would you expect the rest of Indian history to proceed along?

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.280
[Amit Varma]: Indirectly, what I'm asking you is what do you feel about say Thomas Carlyle's great

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.960
[Amit Varma]: man theory of history, which I assume you would say that look, Akbar certainly was a

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.920
[Amit Varma]: great man without him, India's history is completely different.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.120
[Amit Varma]: Who could have built this empire?

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.120
[Amit Varma]: But you know, I look at Khosrow and I think that no one talks of Khosrow, but he was so

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.680
[Amit Varma]: close.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.600
[Amit Varma]: And had he gotten it, you know, Jahangir and Shah Jahan and therefore Aurangzeb later might

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.720
[Amit Varma]: never have been emperors.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.080
[Amit Varma]: Is that something you've thought about?

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:21.680
[Guest]: I haven't thought much, although you can't help feeling sorry for Khosrow if you read

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:22.680
[Guest]: about him.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.680
[Guest]: Of course, he really does.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.920
[Guest]: He's so close.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.400
[Guest]: And he has such powerful support.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:32.080
[Guest]: I mean, he has the support, probably possibly of his own grandfather, Akbar.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:39.240
[Guest]: And he certainly has the support of Man Singh, his uncle, and his father in law, Mirza Aziz

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:44.680
[Guest]: Koka, who is Akbar's one of his closest, closest friends, advisors and his foster brother.

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.040
[Amit Varma]: And Man Singh, of course, was a governor of Bengal and perhaps one of the best generals

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.040
[Guest]: of the Mughal Empire.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.040
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.760
[Guest]: So he had this powerful backing.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:58.520
[Guest]: And then suddenly to have that snatched away, and then to be so clear in your own mind that

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:05.200
[Guest]: you deserve the throne more than your father does, that you then within six months, rebel.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.840
[Guest]: And you know, he gets this, he gets enough support.

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:15.320
[Guest]: And yet he has terrible luck, and he clearly doesn't have as much experience in sort of

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.200
[Guest]: leading a rebellion.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.640
[Guest]: So he's captured.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:25.920
[Guest]: And as you said, his general meet this sort of gruesome punishment and the rest of them.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.760
[Guest]: I mean, you know, he, Khosrow himself, is made to ride on sort of an emaciated elephant

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.360
[Guest]: through the gates of Lahore.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:37.200
[Guest]: And on either side of him, you know, hundreds of his supporters are impaired.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:44.400
[Guest]: So you know, dying gruesomely on either side of the road as he walks, marches past them.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:48.360
[Guest]: And yet the same chap, I mean, obviously had some degree of charisma and appeal because

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:54.960
[Guest]: within again, a year or so, maybe a few months, he's managed to ferment another, you know,

01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:00.120
[Guest]: rebellion, which is when sort of Jahangir has him blinded.

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.640
[Guest]: Though even that is possibly was a reversible blinding.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:09.080
[Guest]: And because the eyes, the eyelids are sewn together, and then they can be opened.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.080
[Amit Varma]: That's convenient.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:13.800
[Amit Varma]: So if he changes his mind, if he changes his mind, yeah.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:19.600
[Guest]: So there's some accounts that say that he, you know, at some point he was, his eyes were

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.080
[Guest]: opening yet, which is why he remained a threat to Khurram.

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:28.840
[Guest]: You know, otherwise, if he had been really blind, then Khurram need not have...

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:34.280
[Amit Varma]: No, and one of the anecdotes, which was really striking, and which made me think a little

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.800
[Amit Varma]: harder about Khosrow, what kind of man he must have been, is that you point out that

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:42.040
[Amit Varma]: much later in life, when, you know, Noor Jehan is a very powerful figure, and we'll talk

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.480
[Amit Varma]: about that a little while later.

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:48.680
[Amit Varma]: But what essentially, so she was married earlier to this guy called Sher Afghan, I think, and

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.240
[Amit Varma]: she had a daughter through Sher Afghan.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:55.520
[Amit Varma]: And she was thinking of getting that daughter married to Khosrow, which would immediately

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.200
[Amit Varma]: make him a contender for the throne again.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:02.080
[Amit Varma]: And Khosrow refused, because he wanted to be loyal to his wife.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.880
[Amit Varma]: And his wife said that, No, no, this is good for you.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.080
[Amit Varma]: This will finally get us out of the wilderness, you could be emperor.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.360
[Amit Varma]: And he said, No, I'm not going to do it.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.160
[Amit Varma]: And this blew my mind, who does this?

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:17.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, when it's so commonplace for these guys to have multiple sort of...

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.520
[Guest]: Yeah, although this is a story that is told.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:26.320
[Guest]: So you know, it's possible he did, it seems like very foolish of him, if he did do that.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.920
[Guest]: But it's also possible that he disliked Noor Deha very much, who knows, you know, maybe

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.400
[Guest]: he didn't trust her, maybe he didn't, you know, because it was, it was difficult.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:38.120
[Guest]: But, but all he just made the very wrong choice.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.760
[Guest]: But but you know, to come back to what you're saying about what would have happened if he

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:50.040
[Guest]: had been, if he, I don't know, I think, to me, if you look at how the empire first grows

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:57.240
[Guest]: and then sort of collapses upon itself, you know, succession is, of course, one part of

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.240
[Guest]: it.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:02.880
[Guest]: But and this idea that there's no primogeniture amongst the Mughals, so there isn't, you know,

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.800
[Guest]: but there was, it's not like there wasn't a system and the system would be to sort of

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.320
[Guest]: divide the empire amongst different heirs.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:15.000
[Guest]: And you know, one of the most interesting things that I've been reading, I've been reading

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.320
[Guest]: about Humayun a little bit in the last few months, and you know, there is this suggestion

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:25.360
[Guest]: that towards the end of his reign, Babur was beginning to feel about Humayun very much

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:30.960
[Guest]: as Akbar was feeling about Jahangir, that the staff was not up to it, you know, that

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.400
[Guest]: so he didn't want to, he was anyway he had parceled out, I think he had given Kabul to

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:40.140
[Guest]: Kamran and I think perhaps Lahore and Punjab to Askari.

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:46.560
[Guest]: And he was he wanted to send Humayun to Badakhshan, but Humayun was posted there, he was not supposed

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:55.040
[Guest]: to be in Delhi, and Delhi and Agra would go to Babur's brother in law, who was married

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:02.120
[Guest]: to his sister Khanzada Begum, who is one of the most memorable characters in that family.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.880
[Guest]: And she was very close to her.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:08.240
[Guest]: So the suggestion is that in fact, he was going to make his sister, in a sense, the

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.240
[Amit Varma]: de facto Empress.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:14.640
[Guest]: The Empress of this part of the empire, you know, and then they would sort of share and

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:20.440
[Guest]: then even under Akbar, I mean, Akbar becomes emperor of whatever little bit Humayun has

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.200
[Guest]: managed to get back.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:26.960
[Guest]: His younger brother, Muhammad Hakim is in Kabul and he is sort of he and his mother

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.240
[Guest]: are the rulers of Kabul and Kabul remains a kind of autonomous region, even though you

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:36.800
[Guest]: know, Hakim rebels once or twice and Akbar sends in an army, but until he dies, Akbar

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:42.120
[Guest]: doesn't make Kabul into one of, you know, part of the empire.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:45.560
[Guest]: But then, you know, the empire just expands and expands and expands.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:54.040
[Guest]: And so then does the lure of it, you know, so by the time you come to Shah Jahan and

01:08:54.040 --> 01:09:03.080
[Guest]: then to Aurangzeb, the stakes are so high that and the greed also then, you know, it

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:10.280
[Guest]: multiplies by leaps and bounds and so does the venality and the murderous impulses.

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:17.120
[Guest]: So you know, unless Khosrow had lost the empire, he had to begin again from scratch.

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:23.400
[Guest]: If he had been as successful as Jahangir was and there's no, it's not necessary that he

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:27.600
[Guest]: might or might not have been because Jahangir, I don't think would have taken it lying down.

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:33.680
[Guest]: And he would have had a he did have a very strong support, you know, and he would have

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.920
[Guest]: he would have attracted support also.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.440
[Guest]: He was not bad at creating alliances and drawing people to him.

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:46.720
[Amit Varma]: In fact, one of the interesting things that, you know, after he won the battle of succession,

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:50.840
[Amit Varma]: which I'll ask you about, one of the things he did was he forgave many of the people who

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:55.360
[Amit Varma]: were against him, you know, almost like, you know, Lincoln and the team of rival things

01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:00.320
[Amit Varma]: where, you know, he forgave all these people, even in the example of, you know, Abdul Rahim,

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:05.840
[Amit Varma]: who was stuffed in donkey skin and paraded through, but ultimately back in the court.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.400
[Amit Varma]: So he was obviously a very interesting kind of statesman.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.000
[Amit Varma]: He wasn't completely incompetent.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
[Amit Varma]: He was making his sort of alliances and stuff.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.520
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a quick commercial break now.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:19.560
[Amit Varma]: And we'll come back after that and talk more about the fascinating life of Emperor Jahangir.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:24.120

[Amit Varma]: is entertaining.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.640
[Amit Varma]: These are incredible stories.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.440
[Amit Varma]: You can't make this shit up.

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:06.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, while we were at the break, you sort of told me that, you know, you went back

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:10.920
[Amit Varma]: to my earlier question about how ordinary people lived in the Mughal Empire, because

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:11.920
[Amit Varma]: what do they do?

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.840
[Amit Varma]: They don't get up in the morning and look at their smartphone and complain about the

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:15.840
[Amit Varma]: battery.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:21.360
[Amit Varma]: So, so tell me a bit about, you know, what insights you gained on that from reading the

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360
[Amit Varma]: literature of this period.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:27.840
[Guest]: No, so there was, you know, it wasn't so much insight as just these sometimes these really

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:37.080
[Guest]: vivid glimpses of moments in everyday life, you know, and, you know, amongst them, for

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:40.640
[Guest]: example, and many of them come from the sort of European writers, because they are the

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:47.040
[Guest]: ones who, you know, recording what it is to live every day or to the sites that they see

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.400
[Guest]: for their audiences back home.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:56.520
[Guest]: So, you know, somebody, one of them very bitterly, in fact, writes about how, you know, people

01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:02.760
[Guest]: in some villages, he sees women and children wearing necklaces of, of clothes, you know,

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.660
[Guest]: because clothes are so, so, so cheap here.

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:12.440
[Guest]: And this poor man is trying to, he's a Dutch trader and he's bringing spices from the Spice

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:18.840
[Guest]: Islands to India, but you know, he's not able to make very much money for what he brings.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.760
[Guest]: And he has to spend more than he has on what he needs to buy.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:26.200
[Guest]: Or you have, you know, another, another writer who arrives in Gujarat.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.000
[Guest]: So he's writing about Cambe and then about Surat.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.040
[Guest]: And he presents this very dynamic view of these, you know, bustling cities with these

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:40.800
[Guest]: bullock carts racing through the streets with, you know, the bells on the, on the necks of

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:45.800
[Guest]: the, of the, of the bulls ringing loudly to, to alert everyone.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:49.840
[Guest]: He talks about hospital, animal hospitals, you know, and hospital, I mean, obviously

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:55.920
[Guest]: for larger animals like gaushalas and all, but also hospitals for, for mice and for birds

01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:03.360
[Guest]: and you know, and, and he presents also this, you know, picture of, of, you know, tanks

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:09.760
[Guest]: built at regular intervals as, you know, water or access to water is something that is provided

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:17.360
[Guest]: as a philanthropic act by the richer people in a town or a city.

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:22.800
[Guest]: And also, you know, you know, what, what also, you know, so what struck me was how they talk

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:29.640
[Guest]: about, how they talk about religious freedom, because, you know, they all, almost all of

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:35.280
[Guest]: them say that there's an extraordinary, as one of, as Pietro Dalla Valle says, an extraordinary

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.640
[Guest]: liberty of conscience in the realm of the Mughal.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.640
[Guest]: That's a lovely phrase, liberty of conscience.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:47.000
[Guest]: It is, and it sounds very, you know, 20th, 21st century, it sounds like, but people,

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.280
[Guest]: anyone is free to practice, not only to practice whatever religion they wish to, but also to

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:57.840
[Guest]: criticize the other, you know, and these are people who are coming from very sectarian

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.680
[Guest]: Europe where people are killing each other, you know, for, for differences of sect, let

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.080
[Guest]: alone religion.

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:06.880
[Guest]: And so they're always surprised to see what's going on here.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:12.680
[Guest]: But they also, clearly defining it, they also notice this idea of purity that runs through

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:17.360
[Guest]: the India that they see and, you know, of, of, of castes.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.920
[Guest]: And so there's a young, there's an Englishman who comes, while Thomas Rowe is here, and

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:27.440
[Guest]: he has this great idea of building public water supply in Agra.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.800
[Guest]: And Thomas Rowe is really scathing, and he says, this guy, I mean, and you know, what,

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.120
[Guest]: what kind of stupid plan is this?

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.800
[Guest]: Because nobody will drink water that is not fetched by his own caste.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:43.360
[Guest]: You can't have public water flowing like this, because nobody will touch it.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:52.520
[Guest]: And Pietro della Valle, in fact, is in his, his sort of expat community, are so fascinated

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:58.760
[Guest]: by this idea of pure and impure touch that they improvise a little drinking game where,

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:04.080
[Guest]: you know, everyone is to drink their wine in the Indian fashion without touching the,

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.880
[Guest]: the cup to the lip.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:12.120
[Guest]: And whoever spills it then loses, I suppose.

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:18.720
[Guest]: So, so you get, one of the things that you get actually from, from Jahangir, and it was,

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:24.720
[Guest]: it was to me really surprisingly vivid image was, you know, he's, he's also traveling in

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:35.160
[Guest]: Gujarat and he says the roads are lined with these sort of waste level shelves, you know,

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:40.120
[Guest]: and, and he says that they're there, so because porters, because there's so much trade, so

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:47.160
[Guest]: porters can rest their load on that shelf without having to take off the load from their

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.160
[Guest]: back.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:58.000
[Guest]: It seemed like a very clever and considerate idea, you know, so, so, so yeah, so there

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000
[Guest]: is this,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.320
[Amit Varma]: In fact, when I, you know, read your book and read this bit about Gujarat and the porters

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:09.680
[Amit Varma]: relieving themselves, I was reminded of a tweet a few months back, I forget by whom,

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:15.040
[Amit Varma]: I vaguely seem to think it's one of the journalists who works at the Hindu, but I'm not very sure.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:21.120
[Amit Varma]: But the tweet basically had a picture of this big shelf like thing somewhere in Tamil Nadu,

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.040
[Amit Varma]: and saying, do you know what this is for?

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:26.520
[Amit Varma]: And no one in the area, no one's really seem to have an idea what it was for.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:31.080
[Amit Varma]: And the purpose was for laborer women who are carrying things on their head, they can

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.080
[Amit Varma]: rest it there.

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:35.120
[Amit Varma]: So it's at a slightly higher height than these shelves would be.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:40.080
[Amit Varma]: And because no one does that anymore, thankfully, we have progressed beyond that.

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.360
[Amit Varma]: No one knows what these things are.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.560
[Amit Varma]: They're like artifacts, like, you know, like, like a trivial Stonehenge, in a sense, what

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.080
[Amit Varma]: is this for?

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.120
[Amit Varma]: But now we know what that's for.

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:55.600
[Amit Varma]: And just knowing what it's for also gives you an image of sort, what kind of life must

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.800
[Amit Varma]: have been like, you know, you were mentioning sort of religious freedoms and all that.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:04.280
[Amit Varma]: And of course, your book has a section on how, for example, the Mughals attitude towards

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:10.160
[Amit Varma]: sati, which is that they disapproved of it, but they didn't want to outlaw it entirely.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:14.440
[Amit Varma]: So the instruction that Jahangir gave to his governors was that you talk to the woman concerned

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:19.240
[Amit Varma]: in every case, offer her inducements, tell her we'll give her a pension or look after

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.240
[Amit Varma]: her.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.880
[Amit Varma]: And only when you're absolutely sure is of her own free will, then what do you do?

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.680
[Amit Varma]: You have to let it kind of proceed.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:32.080
[Amit Varma]: But religion also brings me to the circumstances of his rebellion and eventually taking over.

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:36.480
[Amit Varma]: The rebellion, of course, is very funny in the sense Akbar sends, Murad is dead by now,

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.480
[Amit Varma]: I think.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:40.360
[Amit Varma]: So Danyal is looking after Allahabad.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:46.040
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned how Akbar sends him to the Deccan, which is this constant sort of humorous

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:49.240
[Amit Varma]: leitmotif of this.

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:52.640
[Amit Varma]: And he sends him to Deccan and Danyal is messing up there.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.840
[Amit Varma]: So Akbar goes after him.

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:59.200
[Amit Varma]: And at this point, Jahangir is sent on another campaign with Man Singh.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:03.480
[Amit Varma]: But Man Singh has an emergency in Bengal where he is governor, so he leaves.

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:08.320
[Amit Varma]: And Prince Salim, as he then is surrounded by his hangers on decides to make a play for

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.160
[Amit Varma]: power, takes his army to Agra.

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.160
[Amit Varma]: What happens next?

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:17.000
[Guest]: Takes his army to Agra and is confronted by the wife, Kilij Khan.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.080
[Guest]: Poor man, unenviable position because he has to hold and Jahangir and Salim's idea is to

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.760
[Guest]: raid the treasury.

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:33.080
[Guest]: So Kilij Khan has to keep Akbar's treasury safe while also not losing his own head to

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:37.560
[Guest]: Jahangir's well-known temper.

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:44.280
[Guest]: So which he is doing, he's negotiating and saying, standing firm, not letting Jahangir

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:45.280
[Guest]: in.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:50.120
[Guest]: But who knows how things would have gone except luckily for Kilij Khan, Jahangir's grandmother,

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.120
[Guest]: Hamida Bhanu Begum, hears about this.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:56.560
[Guest]: And she happens to be in Agra and she's just very shocked and dismayed.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.920
[Guest]: And she sends word to say, what are you doing?

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.520
[Guest]: And I'm coming to see you.

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:06.920
[Guest]: And Jahangir is so embarrassed at this idea and doesn't want to, can't face his grandmother.

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:14.080
[Guest]: So he quickly gets on a boat and sails off to Allahabad, which is luckily vacant since

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.120
[Amit Varma]: Danyal is gone.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:24.080
[Amit Varma]: And the sort of the interesting political economy angle behind Jahangir eventually winning

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:28.680
[Amit Varma]: the succession battle against Khosrow also was that, you know, Man Singh and Aziz Khoka

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:31.200
[Amit Varma]: of course supported Khosrow, as you said earlier.

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.200
[Amit Varma]: But the mistake they made, and we can only say it's a mistake in retrospect, is that

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:39.520
[Amit Varma]: rather than just announce him emperor and then try to, you know, work around that, they

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:44.640
[Amit Varma]: order sort of a council of statesmen and elders to decide on the issue.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:52.600
[Amit Varma]: And their powerful faction of a powerful Sunni faction supports Salim and eventually he ascends

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.080
[Amit Varma]: to the throne.

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:57.720
[Amit Varma]: How much like what is the interplay happening here?

01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:03.080
[Amit Varma]: Are these sort of traditional Sunni figures pissed off at Akbar because of, you know,

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:08.960
[Amit Varma]: all of Akbar's syncretic secularizing sort of activities and they're like, no, we must

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:13.240
[Amit Varma]: preserve our faith and that, you know, and Khosrow is Akbar's chosen one.

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.240
[Amit Varma]: So we will go for Salim.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:19.240
[Amit Varma]: Is that, is religion an angle in all of this?

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:22.160
[Guest]: Religion is certainly an angle in all of this.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:31.080
[Guest]: Akbar has pissed off the conservative, particularly the Sunni Muslims in and around his court,

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:38.720
[Guest]: because he has, of course, for his many heresies, he has proclaimed a whole new religion, forget.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:43.360
[Guest]: So he's, you know, see the rumors about that he has forsaken Islam, that he's not Muslim

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.840
[Guest]: anymore.

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:52.280
[Guest]: And so people are, and he's taken away not just that, but he's also taken away power

01:22:52.280 --> 01:23:01.320
[Guest]: from the clerics, you know, who had a great deal of power in the previous courts.

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:04.720
[Guest]: So they're not happy and Jahangir is very much playing to this gallery.

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:09.520
[Guest]: So while he's sitting in Allahabad, holding his rebel court, he's also issuing, you know,

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:14.080
[Guest]: fatwas once in a while saying that my father, what he's doing is very bad, very bad and

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:18.960
[Guest]: clearly indicating that he will not do this when he becomes emperor.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.600
[Guest]: So he does have that.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.760
[Guest]: He does have that support.

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:32.280
[Guest]: And but that said, it's, you know, things get very, so, so, so I know if you don't mind,

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:37.480
[Guest]: I'll give you a slightly tangential answer or digressing.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:41.160
[Guest]: But you know, it's interesting to me, one of the things I thought while sort of writing

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:48.080
[Guest]: and thinking about this book, I mean, we think of the Mughals particularly, you know, I mean,

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:53.440
[Guest]: all historical characters, as we know them, perhaps because we have so many or perhaps

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:58.120
[Guest]: because of the way that we have understood our own history are thought of in sort of

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:01.200
[Guest]: black and white bullet point terms, you know.

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:06.760
[Guest]: And with the Mughals, that black and white bullet point tends to focus on this sort of

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:12.640
[Guest]: secularism and communalism, you know, and therefore, the greatest amount of writing,

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:19.680
[Guest]: thinking, debating goes on about this, you know, supposedly secular hero, that is Akbar

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:23.040
[Guest]: and this communal villain who is Aurangzeb.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:27.960
[Guest]: And regardless of whether, you know, secular or communal are words that even make any sense

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:32.240
[Guest]: in the, you know, in the 16th and 17th centuries, this is how we understand them.

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.840
[Guest]: And even if we are trying to sort of rethink those categories, it's difficult to get out

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:40.920
[Guest]: of that trap, you know, either you're saying, oh, no, he was secular, no, he wasn't or secular

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.920
[Guest]: is not the right word.

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:46.800
[Guest]: But somehow those words have to, you know, he was or was not communal, but those words

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:47.800
[Amit Varma]: keep coming.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:52.360
[Amit Varma]: And just thinking about, doesn't this tendency of thinking in these stark binaries carry

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:56.720
[Amit Varma]: on to the present day where we talk of Nehru or Ambedkar or Gandhi, or even Savarkar, who

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:01.360
[Amit Varma]: are all deeply complex figures and you know, cannot be pinned down into black and white.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:06.840
[Amit Varma]: And that's how people make sense of the world and which is why we need historians.

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.560
[Guest]: And that possibly ties into the great man theory too, you know, when either, you know,

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:17.040
[Guest]: the great men of history are either great, greatly good or greatly bad.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:20.920
[Guest]: And that's how they you know, that's how we understand them.

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:26.280
[Guest]: But the interesting thing and the nice thing about Jahangir is because he has no, nobody

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.480
[Guest]: is thinking of him as a great man of any kind.

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:32.680
[Guest]: And so he doesn't have this kind of, there's no pressure, you know.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:38.920
[Guest]: So when you read his life, you can read it with a lot more detachment and see how he

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:42.840
[Guest]: wasn't just this or that, but he was this and also this and also this and also this

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:46.600
[Guest]: and also this, you know, all kinds of things.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:52.640
[Guest]: So I guess one of the things, I mean, post Khosrow's rebellion, but because of it, early

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.320
[Guest]: on in his career is one of the, I suppose if you were thinking of Jahangir in purely

01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:03.600
[Guest]: religious terms, one big blot on his career would be the execution of Guru Arjan Dev.

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:08.920
[Guest]: But once you start looking at it, you know, that story yields many kinds of possible interpretations.

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:13.000
[Guest]: And so one, of course, is that Jahangir talks about it again in the Jahangir Nama, it's

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.080
[Guest]: quite clear.

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.920
[Guest]: And there isn't any hint of there being any religious angle to it.

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:22.800
[Guest]: I mean, until then, Guru Arjan Dev and the Gurus and the Mughals had fairly decent relationship.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:30.160
[Guest]: Guru Arjan Dev himself specifically and Akbar had met and got along and Akbar had given

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.880
[Guest]: him a grant and enjoyed talking to him and all that.

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:38.280
[Guest]: And perhaps because of this reason, Khosrow, when he rebelled, he was on his way to Lahore

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:44.760
[Guest]: and on the way he stopped at the Guru's hermitage and the Guru blessed him and maybe he gave

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.920
[Guest]: him some money, it's not entirely clear.

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:53.520
[Guest]: And later on, Jahangir finds out about this and he has him, he says, I had his property

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:57.200
[Guest]: confiscated and I had him executed.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:02.960
[Guest]: But it doesn't seem at all as if this was anything more than a political act.

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:09.440
[Guest]: On the other hand, it's also possible that Jahangir was in some ways goaded to do this

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:18.640
[Guest]: by his advisors who would amongst them, number some of these Sunni clerics who would have

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:24.840
[Guest]: by, because by this time, Sikhism had sort of evolving as a religion and the Guru was

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:27.480
[Guest]: attracting more and more followers, both Hindus and Muslims.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:30.720
[Guest]: And thereby being a political threat as well as much as.

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:31.720
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:37.000
[Guest]: Being a political and a religious threat to his, to Jahangir's mullahs, not to Jahangir

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000
[Guest]: himself.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.920
[Guest]: So it's possible, you know, that that was also happening.

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:50.320
[Guest]: And there's another story, not of another religious man who dies because of Jahangir.

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.320
[Unknown]: Shustri.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320
[Guest]: Yeah, Shustri.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.320
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:58.480
[Guest]: And I really like this story because he's, you know, so he's a Shia and he's an old man

01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.480
[Guest]: by this time.

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:04.040
[Guest]: And at some point, about 1610 or so, Jahangir has him whipped.

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:09.120
[Guest]: And then he, soon after he dies, most likely as a consequence.

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.000
[Guest]: And there's this chap called Sajjad Rizvi who has a fantastic essay on all the wheels

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.040
[Guest]: within wheels within wheels that are going on here, you know, and it so, so, so Rizvi

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:24.120
[Guest]: says that it's possible that Shustri was pretending not to be Shia because of this sort of growing

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.680
[Guest]: Sunni influence in the court.

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:30.680
[Guest]: It was, he thought it was a good idea to do that.

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:37.360
[Guest]: And Jahangir has him whipped, not because he is Shia, but because he is pretending not

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:38.360
[Guest]: to be.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:43.960
[Guest]: And by that pretence, he is casting an aspersion on Jahangir's liberality.

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:47.960
[Guest]: And Jahangir says also that he's making me look like a coarse and bigoted man.

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:52.160
[Guest]: And you know, how dare he cast this aspersion of bigotry on me.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:59.040
[Guest]: And yet, you know, this Sajjad Rizvi goes on that it's also quite possible that it was

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:04.240
[Guest]: that sectarian Sunni court that had it in for this old, poor old Shia man.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:09.440
[Guest]: And again, sort of arm twisted the emperor into having him whipped.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:16.960
[Guest]: But Jahangir could not admit this because in his own sense of himself, there is no,

01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:24.000
[Guest]: there is forget bigotry or tolerance, there is very little religious sense.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.880
[Guest]: And Thomas Rowe puts it very well.

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:31.160
[Guest]: You know, Thomas Rowe says that he has been bred up without any religion.

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:35.080
[Guest]: And it was easy for me also to identify.

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:39.520
[Guest]: I think that, you know, there are many people who, so I have, you know, my father's Hindu,

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.760
[Guest]: my mother is Sikh, neither was particularly religious.

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:45.440
[Guest]: So, you know, when you're brought up without any kind of religion, you know, I know what

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.720
[Guest]: that, you know, what that means.

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.480
[Guest]: And then Thomas Rowe continues that.

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:54.120
[Guest]: So therefore, he's either the easiest man to convert or the most difficult because he

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:59.120
[Guest]: is willing to listen to everything, but he won't believe anything.

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:05.840
[Guest]: You know, he doesn't have that, that ability to have religious faith, you know, so he's

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:10.120
[Guest]: He'll watch the stripes of the zebra.

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:13.040
[Amit Varma]: Yes, yes, exactly.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:17.520
[Amit Varma]: The Shusuri story was so mind blowing because, you know, when I heard about it, and from

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:25.360
[Amit Varma]: you, it was because it is almost rashmonic in its multiple points of views and its multiple

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:28.640
[Amit Varma]: pretenses that are at the surface level.

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:34.640
[Amit Varma]: Jahangir's claim is that I don't care whether he's Shia or Sunni, but the fact that he pretended

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:39.400
[Amit Varma]: was an affront to my liberalism and therefore that pretence deserves the punishment of death.

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:44.640
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, you point out the possibility that it was under pressure from the Sunnis.

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:49.680
[Amit Varma]: So he's pretending to be loyal to the Sunni faction who he needs for political reasons.

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:53.480
[Amit Varma]: And on the other hand, there is that he then needs to pretend perhaps to himself, perhaps

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:57.240
[Amit Varma]: to the world, that this is not the reason that he actually is liberal.

01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:59.080
[Amit Varma]: So it's layers within layers.

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:03.440
[Amit Varma]: And it seems like, you know, if there's an Indian Kurosawa, this is such an incredible,

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:08.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, your book is full of incredible subjects of the sort for novels or films or whatever.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:11.960
[Amit Varma]: It's just fairly mind boggling to me.

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:18.120
[Amit Varma]: But you know, another interesting aspect of his sort of religious leanings and his sort

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:22.520
[Amit Varma]: of experiments is this interesting guy called Jadrub Ghusain.

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:23.520
[Amit Varma]: Who is Jadrub Ghusain?

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.840
[Guest]: He's not a Muslim.

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:29.040
[Guest]: So Jadrub Ghusain is very much not a Muslim.

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:35.680
[Guest]: He's a very, he's a sort of a Brahmin saint and ascetic.

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:38.120
[Guest]: And Akbar first finds him.

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:41.080
[Guest]: And then Jahangir goes to visit him.

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:45.480
[Guest]: Next he meets him in a cave near Ujjain.

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:51.480
[Guest]: And Jahangir is just amazed by his asceticism and, you know, his frugality.

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:57.200
[Guest]: And he, you know, he eats like three mouthfuls a day and he lives his entire life inside

01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:58.360
[Guest]: this tiny little cave.

01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:03.600
[Guest]: And Jahangir has it measured, of course, it's barely possible for a man to get inside.

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.960
[Guest]: And Jahangir goes to meet him and he meets him in private.

01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:11.440
[Guest]: There's even a painting of that shows, you know, the Jadrub Ghusain and Jahangir talking

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:17.040
[Guest]: outside the cave and all the nobility very much on the fringes of that painting.

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:20.680
[Guest]: And he does this more than once in the Jahangir Nama.

01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:27.080
[Guest]: And he meets him and he has very long, very detailed and clearly fulfilling conversations

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:31.960
[Guest]: because he says, you know, after one of them, he says that, you know, I was very happy to

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:35.920
[Guest]: meet him and I was very sad to depart from him.

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:41.040
[Guest]: And clearly this man also had some influence over Jahangir because there's an essay, I'm

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:48.120
[Guest]: forgetting, I think maybe Shirin Musfi has written this essay about how at some point,

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:54.080
[Guest]: you know, poor Khosrow is in jail or in captivity, but occasionally he's allowed more freedom

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.120
[Guest]: than at other times, you know.

01:32:56.120 --> 01:33:02.120
[Guest]: So at some point you hear in Jahangir Nama, he says that I let Khosrow come to meet me

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:03.120
[Guest]: every day.

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:08.120
[Guest]: And it seems that it may have been that, you know, Khosrow's father-in-law, Aziz Koka,

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:12.720
[Guest]: went to Jadrub Ghusain and said, you know, could you please intercede on his behalf and

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:15.520
[Guest]: let him move around a little.

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:18.760
[Guest]: So he had, you know, he had that kind of influence on Jahangir.

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:25.120
[Guest]: And this idea of asceticism itself seems to have been something that attracted him.

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:29.400
[Guest]: In fact, there's even a painting of him where he's like a bear chested and you know, sitting

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:30.400
[Guest]: with...

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:34.280
[Guest]: Wearing a dhoti and sitting in this sort of ascetic pose.

01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:39.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I'm just thinking aloud and I could be completely wrong, but it seems

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:45.480
[Amit Varma]: to me just listening to both what you've said about his sort of religious quest, as it were,

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:50.700
[Amit Varma]: and also his curiosity about the natural world, such as dog biting the elephant.

01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:57.040
[Amit Varma]: It seems to me that the curiosity itself is intense and genuine, but the quest is kind

01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:02.680
[Amit Varma]: of shallow and that's not necessarily his fault because he is also limited by the tools

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:03.680
[Amit Varma]: at his disposal.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.200
[Amit Varma]: While you can say that for someone like Akbar, for example, in the context of religion, it

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:13.640
[Amit Varma]: would seem that the, you know, both the impulse and the quest itself was deep and genuine.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:17.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, he's actually going and meeting Arjun Dev and chatting with him.

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:19.440
[Amit Varma]: He's writing up to the Dine Elahi.

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:24.640
[Amit Varma]: And for Jahangir, it's like he just falls short in both those areas.

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:25.640
[Guest]: Does that make sense?

01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:31.880
[Guest]: That it could, but also here I have to admit to my own inability, you know, one inability

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:37.760
[Guest]: of not being a historian and therefore not being, I mean, I don't have the languages,

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:38.760
[Guest]: I have just English.

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:42.360
[Guest]: So I can't read in Persian, I can't read in other languages.

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:49.760
[Guest]: And there is this text called Majlis-e-Jahangiri, which records some years of Jahangir's evening

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:50.760
[Guest]: conversations.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:55.920
[Guest]: You know, it's interesting because I think it is Asfar Moin perhaps who pointed this

01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:02.560
[Guest]: out that, you know, I mean, many people say that, for example, in the Jahangir Nama, there

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:05.160
[Guest]: is no mention of Thomas Rowe.

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:10.200
[Guest]: And that can be taken as a mark of how insignificant Thomas Rowe was.

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:15.960
[Guest]: But it's also possible, this is what Moin I think says, that in the Jahangir Nama, Jahangir

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:21.280
[Guest]: is writing about his days, but not about his nights.

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:25.640
[Guest]: The evenings are when he has these conversations with people, both the spiritual religious

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:29.640
[Guest]: conversations and the conversation with ambassadors and visitors and all that.

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:35.680
[Guest]: And some of that is, I mean, it's not recorded by him, but there is this record by another

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:41.640
[Guest]: visitor to his court who records some of these religious conversations that he has with various

01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:45.560
[Guest]: clerics and priests who come to his court.

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:52.400
[Guest]: So, now I don't know, you know, only that I've only been able to, it's not been translated.

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:56.720
[Guest]: So I've only seen a little bit here and there quoted in essays, but it's possible that that

01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:06.320
[Guest]: reveals a deeper quest, I mean, you know, or at least a deeper interest in these matters.

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:12.280
[Guest]: He does, you know, he does, it seems, you know, so Akbar has this idea of Sulaykul,

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:15.920
[Guest]: the peace for all, which becomes a kind of motto for his reign.

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:21.640
[Guest]: And Jahangir, according to little extracts from this book, describes himself as Mazar-e-Kul,

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:24.760
[Guest]: which translates as a sort of universal manifestation.

01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:32.560
[Guest]: He says that even the way that God takes care of all his slaves, so I take care of all God's

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:38.760
[Guest]: slaves, you know, through his own idea of what religion means, of what it means to rule

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:42.440
[Guest]: over different religions.

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:48.640
[Guest]: I don't know how deep or sophisticated they were, but they perhaps are more than we can

01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:51.040
[Amit Varma]: gather only from the Jahangir.

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:54.480
[Amit Varma]: And his instinct seemed to be fairly liberal, as we would call it today.

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:59.000
[Guest]: Oh, so Thomas Rowe has this, there's a little bit in Thomas Rowe where he talks about how

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:07.280
[Guest]: he, you know, at some point, Jahangir is in his gups, and he starts talking about liberality

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:11.480
[Guest]: towards all religions, and Thomas Rowe says he sort of starts crying, because he's so

01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:17.200
[Unknown]: moved by his own good intentions.

01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:25.680
[Guest]: So yes, that idea, certainly, and you know, because he is the product himself of so much

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:32.440
[Guest]: intermingling, you know, he is, he has a Hindu mother, he has a Hindu mother, he has lived

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:40.920
[Guest]: his entire life in Hindustan, you know, he this is his country and, and to me the, you

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:45.640
[Guest]: know, the most telling thing is his taste in food, you know, so you have, you have Babar

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:51.240
[Guest]: who comes here, and he, for the very few years that he's here, he's really missing his melons,

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:57.000
[Guest]: he even literally cries when a shipment of melons arrives in Agra from Kabul, he can't

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000
[Amit Varma]: believe it.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.280
[Amit Varma]: And modern nationalists would find more reason to dislike Babar because he also says bad

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.280
[Amit Varma]: things about mangoes.

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:04.280
[Guest]: He says mangoes are okay, okay.

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:05.280
[Guest]: He says they're a do, but they're nowhere near.

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:06.280
[Guest]: They're not melons.

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:07.280
[Guest]: They're not melons.

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:16.280
[Guest]: And then Jahangir at the beginning of his journey goes to Kabul and almost like it's

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.880
[Guest]: like a mirror effect, you know, he says almost exactly the opposite.

01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:24.080
[Guest]: He says that all the fruits are very nice in Kabul, he has some cherries, he has some

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:28.480
[Guest]: peaches, he has apricots, melons, you know, he says fruits are all very well, but he says

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.840
[Guest]: nothing can match a mango.

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.160
[Amit Varma]: And this is this is really interesting.

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:36.320
[Amit Varma]: And actually, you know, question I was saving for the end of the episode, but I'll ask you

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:42.520
[Amit Varma]: now is this gradual journey where what is essentially a Timurid dynasty, a Timurid people,

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:46.760
[Amit Varma]: they bring their languages with them, their, you know, their harems and all the women and

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:51.360
[Amit Varma]: whatever and, and gradually what happens is that one, they get more and more Hindu because

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.680
[Amit Varma]: if you think about it, Jahangir is half Hindu, and his sons even more than that, because

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:59.880
[Amit Varma]: some of his wives are, you know, Rajput princesses or whatever.

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:04.560
[Amit Varma]: And not only are they in terms of their bloodline and so on getting more and more Hindu and

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:09.640
[Amit Varma]: more and more Indian rather, but even culturally, they're losing those old languages, they're

01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:13.720
[Amit Varma]: losing those sort of old ways.

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:19.160
[Amit Varma]: And it would seem that it's, you know, around this time that you know, that Jahangir that

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:24.160
[Amit Varma]: line is drawn that they are now an Indian dynasty that the past is behind them that

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:29.960
[Guest]: you know, wherever they came from Uzbekistan or whatever, it's in the past.

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:35.760
[Guest]: Yeah, this idea that you know, one day we will conquer Samarkand remains, I think, certainly

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:41.360
[Guest]: all the way up to Aurangzeb, but it remains really as an idea, you know, that lip service,

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:47.200
[Guest]: although they try, I think there's some disastrous campaign that Aurangzeb is sent off on by

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:48.200
[Guest]: Shah Jahan.

01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:51.400
[Guest]: But it's not, I mean, for Babur, that was it.

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:55.080
[Guest]: That was all he wanted was to be king of Samarkand.

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:59.440
[Guest]: That was home and that was his ultimate ambition.

01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:03.440
[Guest]: You know, that was Timur's capital and that was what he wanted to be.

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:07.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I was just reminded by another TIL moment which quizzers would like which I got

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:11.600
[Amit Varma]: from your book, which is about the origin of the word wilayat.

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.240
[Amit Varma]: And you point out how, you know, the term originally means home.

01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:22.480
[Amit Varma]: And it was, you know, Jahangir said it of Kabul or Jahangir said it of Kabul and he

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:23.880
[Amit Varma]: meant it as home.

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:26.360
[Guest]: But over time, it has come to mean the opposite.

01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:27.360
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.480
[Guest]: I was also quite taken aback by that.

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:33.960
[Guest]: It meant sort of homeland or the land of the, you know, ancestors.

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:36.760
[Guest]: And it's the meaning is completely turned around.

01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:39.120
[Amit Varma]: And it kind of depends on who you like.

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:44.560
[Amit Varma]: For example, if an Englishman uses it off England, he is talking of England as his wilayat,

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:45.560
[Amit Varma]: his home.

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:49.320
[Amit Varma]: But then when an Indian starts calling it wilayat, picking up from him, the meaning

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:52.000
[Guest]: changes and somehow that new meaning.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.560
[Amit Varma]: The real meaning.

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:58.800
[Amit Varma]: And that was just, you know, so, so fascinating to me.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's the kind of the really fast.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.600
[Amit Varma]: One thing I learned recently about the Mughals and it's really fascinated me and I did an

01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:11.240
[Amit Varma]: episode on Ira Moukhati with it on her excellent book Daughters of the Sun.

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:15.920
[Amit Varma]: It's about the women, the Mughal women, and even in your book, there is a very prominent

01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:21.800
[Amit Varma]: role played by the women starting with Hamida Banu Bekum, of course, Akbar's mother, Humayun's

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:28.160
[Amit Varma]: bride from Afghanistan, who is, you know, who Jahangir is so scared of that when she

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:32.920
[Amit Varma]: says, I'm coming to see what the hell you are doing, trying to rob the treasury, he

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:35.440
[Amit Varma]: runs off to Allahabad.

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:40.400
[Amit Varma]: And later, one of the sort of things that really struck me about the legendary Nur Jahan

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.520
[Amit Varma]: is that, again, you've pointed out that being an emperor, Jahangir could have any woman

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:46.880
[Amit Varma]: he wanted.

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:51.480
[Amit Varma]: And what he chose, who he fell in love with and stayed so loyal with and build this enduring

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:56.960
[Amit Varma]: friendship and partnership with was a widow in her mid 30s.

01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:05.080
[Amit Varma]: And this whole attitude towards women, the way they revere and respect the women, you

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.160
[Amit Varma]: know, in their palaces and how much they listen to them.

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:10.440
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that.

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:17.840
[Guest]: So, I mean, I think, you know, the more I read about the Mughals and their sort of extended

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:24.880
[Guest]: families, more sort of these very strong women come out, you know, they're just they're all

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:25.880
[Guest]: over the place.

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:33.520
[Guest]: Babur, you know, in his Baburnama, writes about his grandmother as being one of the

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:38.840
[Guest]: most important influences on his life and not just, you know, as grandmother, but also

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:42.520
[Guest]: as actually advisor on military matters and strategic matters.

01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:44.520
[Guest]: Because he's 12 and he's taking over.

01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:45.520
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:50.360
[Guest]: And he goes to her and she advises him on what to do and how to do it.

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:55.920
[Guest]: So and his sister, Khanzada, is very much, I think, in fact, Ira talks about it in her

01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:00.880
[Guest]: book, there's a painting she has in her book in which Khanzada is part of a council, you

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:05.920
[Guest]: know, and she's I think she's she's the biggest figure in that council.

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:11.000
[Guest]: She's clearly the most important person in that in that council.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.800
[Guest]: Then there are, you know, there's some there are others.

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:18.720
[Guest]: There's the Salima Sultan Begum, who's Bayram Khan's wife and later Akbar's wife, then Gulbadan

01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:21.400
[Guest]: Begum, who is Akbar's aunt.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:26.080
[Guest]: And all of these people play a very strong, important role in Jahangir's life.

01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:32.200
[Guest]: There's also Hamida Banu is only one of Humayun's wives and Humayun has at least three who are,

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:40.040
[Guest]: you know, that's fairly rare for three wives to sort of remain known in history for fairly

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:41.040
[Guest]: big accomplishments.

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:47.320
[Guest]: One is, you know, the Haji Begum, his first wife, she builds the Humayun's tomb.

01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:52.560
[Guest]: Then there's, you know, Hamida Banu, who, you know, first resists his overtures for

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:57.680
[Guest]: 40 days, 40 days it takes of him wooing her.

01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:04.640
[Guest]: And one of his stepmothers finally persuades Hamida Banu with that eternal argument that

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:08.280
[Guest]: has been used to persuade, you know, women to marry.

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:10.600
[Guest]: She says that, you know, you have to marry someone.

01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:13.760
[Guest]: So why not him as well as anyone else?

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:16.320
[Amit Varma]: And he's a fugitive right now, mind you, not an emperor.

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:20.960
[Amit Varma]: I think Shersaas Shatori is basically ruling what we call India at this time.

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:27.400
[Guest]: So, there is a fairly bad state and the state will become much worse very soon.

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:33.040
[Guest]: So his third wife, Mahachuchak Begum, who is youngest, sorry, youngest wife, who is

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:39.000
[Guest]: also the mother of Akbar's young half-brother, Muhammad Hakim, and is the de facto ruler

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:47.960
[Guest]: of Kabul and, you know, battles when Akbar sends one of his governors there, she throws

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:55.280
[Guest]: him out and goes to battle with him and defeats him, you know.

01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:03.560
[Guest]: So there are many examples of very, very strong women in the life of Jahangir and Jahangir

01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:09.360
[Guest]: himself is indebted to at least three of them, this, you know, Hamida Banu, his grandmother,

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:16.000
[Guest]: Salima Sultan and Gulbadan Begum for interceding with Akbar on his behalf, you know, keeping

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:24.760
[Guest]: the relationship at least somewhat civil on sort of more or less working terms so that,

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:27.480
[Guest]: you know, it doesn't become completely ineligible.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:32.320
[Amit Varma]: And as you pointed out, the later intercede with Jahangir on Khosrow's behalf.

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:35.560
[Guest]: No, but they do on behalf of Mirza Aziz Khoka.

01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:39.960
[Guest]: So Jahangir wants to, he's, you know, always had a thing in it because Mirza Aziz has supported

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:40.960
[Guest]: Khosrow.

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:41.960
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:51.480
[Guest]: And so when he gets his opportunity, he wants to certainly put him in prison, possibly worse.

01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:59.640
[Guest]: But the women are listening from behind the screen and they call out and they stop him.

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:04.120
[Guest]: So yeah, so they have an influence on and thereafter, you know, Nur Jahan, she becomes

01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:06.080
[Guest]: as powerful as she does.

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:08.200
[Guest]: And it's exceptional, but it doesn't happen in a vacuum.

01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:11.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, there's enough precedent for powerful women.

01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:17.840
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting that, you know, even Nur Jahan's origin story is kind of, you know,

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:23.040
[Amit Varma]: interesting how she was again, not an Indian per se, not like one of the other Rajput princesses.

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:25.520
[Amit Varma]: And tell me a little bit about that.

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:30.440
[Guest]: So she comes fleeing from Persia with her, no, she doesn't come, sorry, her parents come

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.080
[Guest]: fleeing from Persia.

01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:36.040
[Guest]: She is born en route in Kandahar.

01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:42.840
[Guest]: And then, so there is this, what is called the abandonment narrative and the abandonment

01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:49.960
[Guest]: of Nur Jahan that, you know, they have, her mother delivers her, but they are poor, they

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:52.800
[Guest]: are in, it's a difficult journey.

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:56.320
[Guest]: They don't have any, they don't know how they'll be able to take care of her.

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:59.080
[Guest]: So they leave her under a tree.

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:04.360
[Guest]: But they only walked a little while before, you know, my parents decide this is not, they

01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:05.360
[Guest]: can't do this.

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:11.440
[Guest]: So her father goes back and he finds her with, you know, sort of a black snake wrapped around

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:14.680
[Guest]: her or, you know, some variations on that theme.

01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:21.120
[Guest]: And then picks her up and brings her to Agra.

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:26.000
[Guest]: But this is not, I mean, this is not a story that, this is a little, you know, sort of

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.880
[Guest]: a sort of myth making of Nur Jahan.

01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:30.000
[Guest]: There's no such story told.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.240
[Guest]: I mean, Jahangir certainly doesn't tell it.

01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:36.760
[Guest]: So, but whatever it is, they came, they were refugees.

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:41.840
[Guest]: There were many refugees coming in from Persia at the time.

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:48.000
[Guest]: And they found employment in Akbar's court, her father, he asked big.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.400
[Guest]: And then, I mean, he's doing fairly okay, but nothing spectacular.

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:57.360
[Guest]: And under Jahangir, his career is arrested for quite a while.

01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:59.480
[Guest]: He is himself arrested, in fact.

01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:05.840
[Guest]: And his son is, one of his sons is arrested and killed for being part of Khosrow's gang.

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:07.440
[Amit Varma]: Khosrow's second rebellion.

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:08.440
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:11.680
[Guest]: So, so things are not looking very good for them.

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:21.720
[Guest]: And then in 1611, so six years after he becomes emperor, Jahangir marries Nur Jahan.

01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:29.720
[Guest]: And then suddenly, you know, the fortune of the Agyasbeg family just goes through the

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:30.720
[Amit Varma]: roof.

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:34.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they all become incredibly powerful.

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:37.720
[Amit Varma]: And Nur Jahan is almost co-ruling with him in a sense.

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:43.360
[Amit Varma]: In fact, a common criticism, which you point out may have been motivated by Shah Jahan's

01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:47.880
[Amit Varma]: sort of trying to rationalize his rebelling against Nur Jahan.

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:50.240
[Amit Varma]: And the king was sort of, oh, he wasn't really governing.

01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:51.240
[Amit Varma]: He was a weak emperor.

01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:52.600
[Amit Varma]: Nur Jahan did all the governing.

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:55.840
[Amit Varma]: So a real man had to come and get the job done.

01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:03.160
[Amit Varma]: And the actual probable thing is that Jahangir was egoless in the sense of he was doing what

01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:05.560
[Amit Varma]: was, he was sharing power with her.

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:10.020
[Amit Varma]: And by all accounts, they had a very close friendship as well.

01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:13.240
[Amit Varma]: And he was sharing power with her because it was a practical thing to do that left him

01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:20.360
[Amit Varma]: to hunt and to drink and do the sort of things that he kind of enjoyed.

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:24.720
[Amit Varma]: What also intrigued me was the sort of political games, like on the one hand, Khurram, the

01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:27.720
[Amit Varma]: later Shah Jahan is married to her niece.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:32.480
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, she then tries to get her daughter from her first marriage married

01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:33.480
[Amit Varma]: to Khosrow.

01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:39.120
[Amit Varma]: But Khosrow refuses allegedly, but Khurram anyway has Khosrow killed later.

01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:43.200
[Amit Varma]: And that daughter ends up marrying the youngest brother, Sheryar.

01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:46.200
[Amit Varma]: And Sheryar becomes a contender to the throne.

01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:51.480
[Amit Varma]: But then eventually when, you know, and after Jahangir for a very brief while, Khosrow's

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:54.200
[Amit Varma]: son is sort of told that you are the king.

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.560
[Amit Varma]: And then Shah Jahan just has all of them knocked off.

01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:59.080
[Guest]: It's a bloodbath.

01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:05.520
[Guest]: It reminded me of you know, that that last scene, that last montage in the Godfather,

01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:11.600
[Guest]: you know, when one after the other, all the competition is being is just shot through

01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:12.600
[Amit Varma]: the head.

01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:19.400
[Amit Varma]: He just wipes them out, but his son is Aurangzeb, so karma is on the way.

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:24.520
[Amit Varma]: But tell me also a little bit about like when most people think of Jahangir and thanks perhaps

01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:27.960
[Amit Varma]: to Bollywood and Mughlai Azam, they think of Salim and Anarkali.

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:28.960
[Amit Varma]: Did Anarkali exist?

01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:34.120
[Guest]: So there's no, I mean, I just feel very bad every time I have to say this, because I found

01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:40.040
[Guest]: people I didn't realize until after I wrote this book and started talking to people how

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:46.520
[Guest]: fond people are of the story of Anarkali and Salim and how much, how people don't at all

01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:49.000
[Guest]: like being told that she didn't exist.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:57.200
[Guest]: Though, I mean, you know, I like, I mean, there's no particular evidence for her having

01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:03.320
[Guest]: existed, except that there's this diary entry by a chap called William Finch, who's one

01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:06.340
[Guest]: of those early East India Company traders.

01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:14.120
[Guest]: And he goes here, again, he goes to Lahore and he says there's this tomb and the tomb

01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:20.800
[Guest]: is of Imam Kali, translated as pomegranate blossom.

01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:26.840
[Guest]: And she was, she was the Akbar's wife and Daniyal's mother.

01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:31.980
[Guest]: And Shah Salim had a quote unquote to do with her.

01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:37.760
[Guest]: So it's not at all the sort of epic romance that we have in Mughal-e-Azam, it's much more

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:41.080
[Guest]: sordid story that he tells.

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:42.080
[Guest]: But tomb is there.

01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:48.080
[Guest]: I think the, I think the archaeological survey has offices there or something, there's a

01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:51.240
[Guest]: sort of government office in that tomb.

01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:58.400
[Guest]: From what I've read, it is said to be the tomb of one of Jahangir's wives, but not Anarkali,

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:03.480
[Guest]: but Sahib Jamal, who was the mother of his second son, Parvez.

01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:11.400
[Guest]: Also, like it seemed to me that if she had existed and if, I mean, the story as it's

01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:16.240
[Guest]: told, certainly as a story as it's told in Mughal-e-Azam does not hold water in the context

01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:22.720
[Guest]: of, you know, Mughal family life, because class would certainly not have been an issue.

01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:28.360
[Guest]: You know, if Jahangir could have as many concubines as he wanted, nobody would stop him.

01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:31.360
[Guest]: And marry whoever he wanted.

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:35.720
[Guest]: In fact, there is an instance of him wanting to marry somebody that Akbar doesn't approve

01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:41.280
[Guest]: of, you know, because he wants to marry Zayn Khan's, a nobleman's daughter or niece, and

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:42.960
[Guest]: he's already married to her niece and daughter.

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:46.520
[Guest]: So Akbar doesn't like this idea of, you know, marrying two women who are so closely related

01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:47.520
[Guest]: to each other.

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:54.680
[Guest]: But Jahangir insists and eventually, you know, Akbar gives in and that's it.

01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:59.160
[Guest]: There's no, you know, it doesn't become some huge issue.

01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:03.880
[Guest]: So for all these reasons, it seemed to me that it wasn't, I don't find it particularly

01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:09.120
[Guest]: credible, but, you know, who knows, maybe we'll discover something later.

01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:15.680
[Guest]: But also I think what at some point, you know, you know, the stories that, I guess, you know,

01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:21.160
[Guest]: when you're writing any book or any story, or even whether it's history or not, there

01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:25.920
[Guest]: are certain stories you are more attracted to or want to tell more than others.

01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:32.760
[Guest]: So I thought, you know, this idea of this young love fighting parental opposition is

01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:36.360
[Guest]: a very nice story, but it has been told so many times.

01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:42.240
[Guest]: And for me, the more interesting story, even if that Anarkali story is true, for me, the

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:45.000
[Guest]: more interesting story is the Noor Jeha Jahangir story.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:51.760
[Guest]: You know, this, this, these, these two people who meet very much in their middle age, you

01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:56.280
[Guest]: know, by even by today's standards, let alone those times, she's in her 30s, he's in his

01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:57.280
[Guest]: 40s.

01:53:57.280 --> 01:53:59.680
[Guest]: They have both been married before, not just...

01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:02.760
[Amit Varma]: Kindly watch your words by today's standards, 40 is very young.

01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:06.160
[Guest]: 40 is very young, I know.

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:07.160
[Guest]: It's the new 30.

01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:10.160
[Guest]: 40 is the new late 20s.

01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:19.520
[Guest]: So I just turned 22.

01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:24.720
[Guest]: So yeah, so, so this idea of, you know, I mean, he's, of course, been married, he's

01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:29.920
[Guest]: much married, but she also is not, you know, she's not, she's her second marriage, too.

01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:34.080
[Guest]: She already has a child by her first marriage.

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.840
[Guest]: They don't have any children together.

01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:36.840
[Guest]: He never married again.

01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:38.880
[Guest]: After that, she's his last wife.

01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:45.120
[Guest]: They seem to share a relationship of some degree of equality, some degree of mutual

01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:46.120
[Guest]: respect.

01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:47.120
[Guest]: They clearly have similar interests.

01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:50.400
[Guest]: You know, I mean, he is addicted to hunting.

01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.760
[Amit Varma]: We've already started.

01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:53.080
[Amit Varma]: She's supposed to be a really good shot.

01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:55.000
[Guest]: She's supposed to be a really good shot.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:02.520
[Guest]: And you know, he has an interest in sort of jewelry and clothes and beauty.

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:06.320
[Guest]: So does she, you know, she's sort of that.

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:15.280
[Guest]: The tomb of her father, Itimad-ud-Daulah's tomb in Agra is really a really gorgeous little

01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:16.280
[Guest]: monument.

01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:21.120
[Guest]: So they have both have a very finely developed aesthetic sense.

01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:27.800
[Guest]: They both enjoy, you know, feasting and partying and traveling, you know, they travel together

01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:29.160
[Guest]: up and down the country.

01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:35.280
[Amit Varma]: There's a very nice anecdote in your book about the lights of the city going off because,

01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:38.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, they're coming back from somewhere together in a bullock cart.

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:42.840
[Amit Varma]: He's riding a bullock cart and she's by his side and his people feel the emperor should

01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:44.680
[Amit Varma]: not be seen like this.

01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:47.640
[Amit Varma]: But it's just a couple enjoying a really nice moment.

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:50.600
[Guest]: No, no, not the emperor not be seen like this.

01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:55.360
[Guest]: So they've put off the lights because, so to keep her in purdah, because she's out,

01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:57.600
[Guest]: she's sitting with him.

01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:00.320
[Amit Varma]: So she's not, she's not, she's not.

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:03.400
[Amit Varma]: The absence of light as a purdah of sorts.

01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:07.680
[Guest]: So the absence of light as purdah and this, you know, he's commanded a bullock cart from

01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:09.280
[Guest]: somewhere and the two of them are riding.

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:11.400
[Guest]: I thought it's a lovely image.

01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:18.520
[Guest]: And yeah, to me it captures something of their, something of the sort of carefree, that kind

01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:24.160
[Guest]: of carefree love or carefree affection, which I think comes later in life.

01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:27.960
[Guest]: You know, young passion is not, is not carefree in that way.

01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:33.480
[Amit Varma]: This is a mature, settled love and it doesn't even seem to be so say affected by like, you

01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:37.440
[Amit Varma]: know, we know power corrupts, power corrupts the road, people, especially the massive power

01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:39.280
[Amit Varma]: that a Mughal emperor must have.

01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:41.840
[Amit Varma]: But this seems to be quite removed from all of that.

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:43.880
[Guest]: It's just genuine affection.

01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:44.880
[Guest]: It comes across.

01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:51.120
[Guest]: And so that was the story that I liked that story better.

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:55.960
[Guest]: And so that was the one that I was more interested in, in English.

01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:57.440
[Amit Varma]: That's a very powerful story.

01:56:57.440 --> 01:56:59.800
[Amit Varma]: We've already spoken for more than a couple of hours.

01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:00.800
[Amit Varma]: Tell me something.

01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:05.760
[Amit Varma]: I see sort of four kind of divergent trends.

01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:10.560
[Amit Varma]: And one trend is, of course, that history is used more and more these days as a political

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:11.560
[Amit Varma]: tool.

01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:17.200
[Amit Varma]: It's simplified and you know, so you'll paint historical figures in either black or white

01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:22.960
[Amit Varma]: and use it to suit your narrative purposes, whatever they might be, which indicates that

01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:27.840
[Amit Varma]: simplistic narratives, maybe another illustration of this is the romance between the alleged

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:31.560
[Amit Varma]: and arcane and jungi that simplistic narratives have an appeal to us.

01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:32.560
[Amit Varma]: We can all get it.

01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:35.960
[Amit Varma]: Our mind is not a mind resist complexities.

01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:42.120
[Amit Varma]: But yet I see in modern times in the last two or three decades in the rest of the world

01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:46.560
[Amit Varma]: and maybe now over here with people like you and Manu Pillay and Ira Makhoti and Anna Safi

01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:51.720
[Amit Varma]: coming along, that there is also this readership developing this hunger developing for popular

01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:54.720
[Amit Varma]: history where people just love these stories.

01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:59.080
[Amit Varma]: They can take the complexity, you know, they are not choosing simple binaries.

01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:04.560
[Amit Varma]: There is a hunger for these and part of these I have mused in the past is perhaps because

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:05.840
[Amit Varma]: we love stories.

01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:07.440
[Amit Varma]: That's how we explain the world to each other.

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:11.200
[Amit Varma]: And where can you get better stories than in our history, especially India's history

01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:17.420
[Amit Varma]: is just wild and mind boggling and so entertaining.

01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:18.600
[Amit Varma]: And these are two divergent things.

01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:21.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, one is history as a political tool being simplified binaries.

01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:25.000
[Amit Varma]: But the other is that people just love history.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000
[Amit Varma]: What are your thoughts on this?

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:32.640
[Guest]: No, I think I think the way you put it is really that's it's true that you know, people

01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:33.640
[Guest]: love history.

01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:40.720
[Guest]: People also like at a certain level, I think in school particularly, you will find, you

01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:47.280
[Guest]: know, that almost near near unanimous agreement that history is just the most boring subject

01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:52.440
[Guest]: and maths is the most incomprehensible, you know, and possibly for similar reasons, because

01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:57.080
[Guest]: they're both taught in these abstract terms that seem to have no relevance to to real

01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:58.080
[Guest]: life.

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:03.200
[Guest]: You know, those mathematical formulas, I still don't know what it was that I was memorizing

01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:05.080
[Guest]: and to what end.

01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:11.420
[Guest]: And similarly, with, you know, this history and that's what we started off talking.

01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:18.600
[Guest]: And at the same time, it's also you know, in our current political life, excites great

01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:23.040
[Guest]: passions and you know, great anger.

01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:28.000
[Guest]: And so, you know, I don't know if you've read this book that's come out recently called

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.720
[Guest]: Malevolent Republic.

01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:31.640
[Guest]: Of course, by Kapil Kumar.

01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:32.880
[Guest]: I just finished reading it.

01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:35.560
[Guest]: I thought it was very polemical, very compelling.

01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:36.560
[Guest]: I enjoyed it very much.

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:40.320
[Guest]: I don't know whether I agreed with every part of it, but it was very good.

01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:44.200
[Amit Varma]: There were parts I didn't agree with, but it was extremely thought provoking and so

01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:45.200
[Amit Varma]: well written.

01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:47.960
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, I've asked Kapil to be on my show and he's agreed, but we've never actually

01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:50.840
[Amit Varma]: managed to make, be in the same place at the same time.

01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:52.200
[Amit Varma]: So one day we will make that work.

01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:54.200
[Guest]: I look forward to hearing him talk.

01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:56.200
[Amit Varma]: To continue with your thought.

01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:57.920
[Guest]: So I felt very similar.

01:59:57.920 --> 01:59:59.860
[Guest]: I mean, I enjoyed it very much.

01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:05.960
[Guest]: And he has these asides, if you remember, on history and he and he and he basically

02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:14.400
[Guest]: his argument is that a certain type of nationalist, mostly leftist historian has not been entirely

02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:22.600
[Guest]: accurate about the past, has sort of papered over the sins of, you know, Muslim invaders

02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:28.640
[Guest]: while only attacking European colonizers.

02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:31.440
[Guest]: And I'm not sure if I entirely agree with this.

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:35.960
[Guest]: You know, there are there are many writings of many sorts on the many, many different

02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:40.880
[Guest]: types of Muslim rulers that India has had.

02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:49.440
[Guest]: But I do I think that that he's right in the sense that there has been a certain sense

02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:54.280
[Guest]: of nation building that has informed the writing of history.

02:00:54.280 --> 02:01:00.080
[Guest]: And it's not surprising, you know, in a postcolonial country when the entire country's every all

02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:05.280
[Guest]: resources are concentrated on keeping the country one.

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:07.080
[Guest]: So naturally, history also comes into that.

02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:10.680
[Guest]: So that I think perhaps accounts for the fact that, you know, history, the way that we are

02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:17.080
[Guest]: taught it is all, you know, worthy, worthy, not just great men and women, but worthy men

02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:23.840
[Guest]: and women, virtuous men and women who have been virtuously working from, you know, ancient

02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:32.320
[Guest]: times from Buddha onwards, they were all working to make India sort of the nation state that

02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:33.400
[Guest]: it is.

02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:38.040
[Guest]: And the problem with that is, I mean, one, of course, that it turns history into something

02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:42.680
[Guest]: that can be a little boring and, you know, just sort of talking down, kind of a morality

02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:44.400
[Guest]: play more than anything else.

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:48.920
[Guest]: But also that it can be that it can be flipped, you know, so suddenly, you know, after the

02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:55.880
[Guest]: decades of doing this, the country's sense of itself now depends on what happened in

02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:58.720
[Guest]: the past or how we say what happened in the past.

02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:04.800
[Guest]: So suddenly the country, you know, the nation wants to know why Aurangzeb did this, or,

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:09.400
[Guest]: you know, how dare he break these temples or what is Tipu Sultan doing in our textbook.

02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:14.560
[Guest]: And so it becomes, there's something sort of disproportionate, you know, the past takes

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:18.480
[Guest]: on a disproportionate relevance to the present.

02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:23.280
[Guest]: And then from there, of course, it almost way too easily that the present then has to

02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:29.600
[Guest]: be spent writing these supposed wrongs from the past.

02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:34.240
[Amit Varma]: And that doesn't spell very good news for us.

02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:38.200
[Amit Varma]: And I think that comes both from the right and the left.

02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:41.480
[Amit Varma]: My friend, the political commentator Sadanand Dhoomey was on the show a few months ago,

02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:47.360
[Amit Varma]: and he made the very interesting point that whenever he appears on these TV talk shows

02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:53.280
[Amit Varma]: with right-winger supporters of the current dispensation, he finds that they seem to have

02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:58.160
[Amit Varma]: almost this warped sense of time, where what happened yesterday is as relevant as what

02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:00.200
[Amit Varma]: happened in the 1500s.

02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:06.080
[Amit Varma]: And you know, the fact that Babur breaking a mosque can have ripples of repercussion

02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:14.080
[Amit Varma]: through the centuries is both perverse and almost kind of stunning.

02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:17.640
[Amit Varma]: So it's sort of, you know, whenever I end my show, and I'm talking to my guest about

02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:23.520
[Amit Varma]: a particular subject, I'll ask this almost cliched question by now when people on Twitter

02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:28.080
[Amit Varma]: make fun of me for asking it every time, which is what gives you hope and what gives you

02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:30.960
[Amit Varma]: despair about XYZ and so on.

02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:34.960
[Amit Varma]: Given the sort of divergent trends of history, on the one hand, it's a political tool and

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:40.000
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, perhaps a study of history in many cases is affected by the ideological

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.160
[Amit Varma]: lens that you bring to bear upon it.

02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:44.120
[Amit Varma]: And that's one side of the situation.

02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:49.960
[Amit Varma]: But the other side is that more and more people have access to historical documents and are

02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:56.360
[Amit Varma]: showing greater interest in books of history, you know, such as by people like you, what

02:03:56.360 --> 02:04:03.360
[Amit Varma]: gives you hope and what gives you despair about the study of history over the next few

02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:05.000
[Amit Varma]: years and decades in India?

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.680
[Guest]: So I think exactly these two things that you said, I think, you know, the despair certainly

02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:17.000
[Guest]: comes from the fact that, you know, like you're saying, Sadanand, who may say that, you know,

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:22.600
[Guest]: it's almost like we are fighting our elections in the 16th century or 17th century.

02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:25.240
[Guest]: You know, those are the burning topics of the day.

02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:30.040
[Guest]: You know, we must have the Mughals be accountable now, demand answers from them.

02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:34.200
[Guest]: And it's a very, it's a clever thing, because, you know, when if you're demanding answers

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:39.560
[Guest]: from the Mughals, then you don't have time to demand answers from your current rulers

02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:44.520
[Guest]: or current government, you know, all the attention is just over there.

02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:51.440
[Guest]: And even that, you know, today we are talking and I don't know the whole news yet, but that,

02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:55.440
[Guest]: you know, Section 144 should have been imposed on many parts, many cities in the country.

02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:59.560
[Amit Varma]: We are recording this on the day of the Ayodhya judgment, by the way.

02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:00.560
[Guest]: So, yeah.

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:06.600
[Guest]: And, you know, imagine that too, that these are the kind of debates that we are embroiled

02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:07.960
[Guest]: in.

02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:14.400
[Guest]: And yet at the same time, this very fact that, you know, I find, you know, that one of the

02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:21.000
[Guest]: one of the nicest and most heartening things about writing this book was that whenever

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:26.640
[Guest]: I've spoken, not just, you know, spoken outside or met people or people who've read it, there's

02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:35.480
[Guest]: been such a huge amount of interest and curiosity that that obviously exists.

02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:41.120
[Guest]: And people, perhaps as a result of this, perhaps because of this kind of, you know, these visceral

02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:45.400
[Guest]: emotional reactions that are sort of taking over our public discourse, perhaps because

02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:50.840
[Guest]: of this, people now want to know what really happened.

02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:56.840
[Guest]: And secondly, you know, people that you meet every day are very happy to enjoy history.

02:05:56.840 --> 02:06:00.720
[Guest]: You know, I mean, I think that's the all these complications and these nuances and all these

02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:06.400
[Guest]: wheels within wheels and stories within stories and all this sort of soap operas of it is

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:10.680
[Guest]: what makes it so interesting and thrilling and absorbing, you know, because these are

02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:15.480
[Guest]: stories and people want to hear those stories and there's nothing about the complication

02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:17.040
[Guest]: that puts them off.

02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:20.040
[Guest]: In fact, that's what attracts people.

02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:24.480
[Guest]: So and I think the fact that, you know, more and more people are writing this kind of book

02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:31.120
[Guest]: is obviously an answer to sort of a growing demand and that that is definitely a good,

02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:41.040
[Guest]: good, I think, nice, hopeful sign that people are not just willing, but want to sort of

02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:48.080
[Guest]: take a deep dive into into the past and just swim around, you know, looking at the fish

02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:54.320
[Guest]: and the corals, not judging all of it or getting hyper excited about all of it, but just enjoying

02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:55.320
[Amit Varma]: the view.

02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:56.320
[Amit Varma]: No, I couldn't agree with you more.

02:06:56.320 --> 02:07:00.640
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I feel extremely hopeful about the fact that, I mean, I just think the more

02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:06.040
[Amit Varma]: people dive into these stories, as you put about and swim about in these strange waters,

02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:10.560
[Amit Varma]: that they will begin to get rid of the otherness of others.

02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:14.960
