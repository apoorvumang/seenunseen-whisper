00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: IVM

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[Amit Varma]: You think you're very smart, don't you?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Well, it depends on how you look at it.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Compared to a chimpanzee, for example,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
[Amit Varma]: you're quite smart.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Compared to many of your fellow humans also,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
[Amit Varma]: you might qualify as smart.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, why else would you listen to this podcast?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
[Amit Varma]: However, compared to AlphaZero,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
[Amit Varma]: you're not smart at all.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, compared to AlphaZero,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
[Amit Varma]: both you and I are incredibly stupid.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
[Amit Varma]: We're as dumb as rocks.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Which is fine, because hey, it's no crime to be stupid.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
[Amit Varma]: We have the brains we are born with.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
[Amit Varma]: What are we going to do?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
[Amit Varma]: So being stupid is not a problem,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
[Amit Varma]: but our problem is that we are stupid and arrogant.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Oh my God, we are so arrogant.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
[Amit Varma]: We think we are the smartest species on this planet,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
[Amit Varma]: which used to be true till recently.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
[Amit Varma]: But it no longer is.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Before we get into today's episode,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
[Amit Varma]: a brief note from our sponsor for this episode.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Are you one of those people, as I used to be,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[Amit Varma]: who enjoy art but somehow never got into actually collecting art

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
[Amit Varma]: because hey, paintings by good artists are scarce and expensive?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Well, then check out IndianColors.com.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Indian Colors licenses images from top Indian artists

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
[Amit Varma]: and puts them on objects of everyday use.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
[Amit Varma]: There's wearable art like kaftans, shrugs, some lovely strolls.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
[Amit Varma]: There's home decor like cushion covers, accessories like tote bags.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
[Amit Varma]: Artists get royalties on sales of these products,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
[Amit Varma]: which I find an interesting new model.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Normally, authors get royalties on books

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
[Amit Varma]: and artists only get paid once when they sell the original painting.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
[Amit Varma]: This gives them a new revenue stream

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
[Amit Varma]: and it also makes art accessible for people like me

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
[Amit Varma]: because we can finally afford to buy it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Even better, there's a sale on right now.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
[Amit Varma]: So head on over to IndianColors.com,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
[Amit Varma]: colors spelled with O-U, not just O,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
[Amit Varma]: and apply the coupon code IVM20,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
[Amit Varma]: IVM for IndusWorks Media, IVM20 to get a 20% discount.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Remember, IndianColors.com and colors with an O-U.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
[Amit Varma]: And now on with our regular programming.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Today's episode is about AlphaZero,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
[Amit Varma]: the computer program that created waves recently

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
[Amit Varma]: when it taught itself to play chess in four hours

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
[Amit Varma]: and then thrashed the strongest chess program in the world,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
[Amit Varma]: the mighty Stockfish.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
[Amit Varma]: This wasn't just an incremental leap in artificial intelligence,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
[Amit Varma]: but was indicative of a quantum leap.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
[Amit Varma]: To get more insight on this,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
[Amit Varma]: I spoke recently to my friend Devangshu Dutta.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Devangshu, or DD as his friends call him,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
[Amit Varma]: is not just a noted columnist and financial analyst,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
[Amit Varma]: but also a serious chess player.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
[Amit Varma]: His chess column every Saturday in Business Standard

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
[Amit Varma]: has been running since the last millennium.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
[Amit Varma]: I've always found him to be a source of great insight

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
[Amit Varma]: on both chess and artificial intelligence.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
[Amit Varma]: Here's the conversation I had with him.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, Devangshu.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
[Guest]: Thank you.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Devangshu, let me start by asking you about AlphaZero's achievement.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, computers have been around for a long time.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Deep Blue first beat Kasparov in 1997,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
[Amit Varma]: and computers overtook humans in terms of playing strength

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
[Amit Varma]: a long, long time back.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
[Amit Varma]: What is so special about AlphaZero?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
[Guest]: Two things, really.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
[Guest]: One is that it thinks differently,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
[Guest]: if one can use the word think for a computer.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
[Guest]: The second is that it is,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
[Guest]: at least from the few games that have been released,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
[Guest]: of its match with Stockfish,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
[Guest]: it is considerably stronger than

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
[Guest]: the strongest chess-playing engines

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
[Guest]: which are available commercially.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
[Guest]: It is also,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
[Guest]: the third thing which is, of course, one is taking on trust,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
[Guest]: is that it taught itself,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
[Guest]: and it taught itself very quickly,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
[Amit Varma]: how to play chess.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
[Amit Varma]: Can you tell me a little bit about how computers,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
[Amit Varma]: before AlphaZero and all the decades past,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
[Amit Varma]: approached chess and what the artificial intelligence

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
[Amit Varma]: to figuring out chess was?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
[Guest]: From the 90s onwards,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
[Guest]: and you know Moore's law

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
[Guest]: that processors essentially double in strength

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
[Guest]: every two years or so,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
[Guest]: from the 90s onwards,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
[Guest]: computers have essentially worked on the brute force method.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
[Guest]: You look at every possible move in a position,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
[Guest]: you look at every possible response to that move,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
[Guest]: you carry on doing this to the kind of depth

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
[Guest]: that time and the processing power allows you,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
[Guest]: and you come to an evaluation of what you think is the best move.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
[Guest]: I'm using the word you and think very loosely here, obviously.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
[Guest]: From the 2000s,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
[Guest]: what happened was that

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
[Guest]: people figured out how to get

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
[Guest]: computers to evaluate positions more efficiently.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
[Guest]: You had a lot of

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
[Guest]: basic things every decent chess player is taught.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
[Guest]: You look at mating possibilities,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
[Guest]: you look at material advantage,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
[Guest]: you look at pawn structure,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
[Guest]: you look at more space control,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
[Guest]: stuff like that.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
[Guest]: People managed to

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
[Guest]: program these into computers

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
[Guest]: in a fairly mathematically exact way.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
[Guest]: The computer had these benchmarks for

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
[Guest]: rules for evaluating positions,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
[Guest]: and you also had

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
[Guest]: a lot of very clever

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
[Guest]: techniques used to prune

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
[Guest]: the search process,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
[Guest]: because the problem with chess, of course,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
[Guest]: is that it involves a huge number of possibilities.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
[Guest]: The deeper you go, the more and more the possibilities expand.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
[Guest]: What chess programmers managed to do was

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
[Guest]: use a variation of

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
[Guest]: the minimax algorithm where you look at

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
[Guest]: the move that can give you the maximum advantage and

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
[Guest]: you assume that your opponent will also be looking at

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
[Guest]: the move that can give him the maximum advantage.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
[Guest]: So your maximum is his minimum,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
[Guest]: because this is a zero-sum game.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
[Guest]: And you keep continuously saying that,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
[Guest]: okay, my maximum advantage is, say, a pawn up,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
[Guest]: and my maximum disadvantage is, say, a pawn down.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
[Guest]: And you keep chucking out the possibilities which are

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
[Guest]: worse than a pawn down,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
[Guest]: and you keep looking for the possibilities which are better than a pawn up.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
[Guest]: So, you know, you look at a possible move, number one,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
[Guest]: and you say, okay, this is my best and this is my worst

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
[Guest]: possible outcomes. And then you look at move two,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
[Guest]: and if you see move two is giving you a

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
[Guest]: better than your previous best, then you'll go

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
[Guest]: automatically to move two and discard move one.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
[Guest]: Now, this is a fairly efficient process,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
[Guest]: and it made

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
[Guest]: programs stronger. Stronger in the sense that if you

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
[Guest]: use the programs post-2000

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
[Guest]: on 1990s hardware,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
[Guest]: you'll still get better results than you would with the programs of

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
[Guest]: the 1990s. And of course, since hardware was improving,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
[Guest]: this process got better and better and better.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
[Amit Varma]: So let me sort of summarize it so far,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
[Amit Varma]: so you can tell me if my understanding is correct.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
[Amit Varma]: How humans typically learn chess is

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
[Amit Varma]: because our computational powers are limited, we use shortcuts called heuristics.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, we are taught things like you should occupy the center first,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
[Amit Varma]: and these pawn structures are good, and your bishop should have a lot of space to move,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, you need to develop your pieces,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
[Amit Varma]: don't move a piece twice in the opening, and so on and so forth.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
[Amit Varma]: And using these heuristics, we sort of learn the game, and

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
[Amit Varma]: obviously, as we grow more and more advanced, we learn better and better heuristics.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
[Amit Varma]: And these are all shortcuts to calculation.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, computers, theoretically, you'd imagine,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
[Amit Varma]: would, given processing power, would just need to know the rules,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
[Amit Varma]: and they'd use brute force, and they'd see through every move,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
[Amit Varma]: and solve the game. But what you're saying is this is not exactly

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
[Amit Varma]: what happened. How they instead evolved was they got a lot of brute force to do

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
[Amit Varma]: enormous amounts of calculation completely, but the game wasn't solved per se,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
[Amit Varma]: and different programs evolved in different ways depending

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
[Amit Varma]: on heuristics that were fed to them, which were a combination of the heuristics

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
[Amit Varma]: humans learnt about chess, and therefore those biases, if they were at all,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
[Amit Varma]: also got fed into the system, and were also specific heuristics,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
[Amit Varma]: which allowed it to prune down decision trees, and, you know,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
[Amit Varma]: satisfies, I don't know if that's a correct word in this context,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
[Amit Varma]: but just keep taking better decisions like that.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Is that broadly accurate, what I just summed up?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
[Guest]: Broadly, yes. And, of course, the thing with the brute force,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
[Guest]: part of it is that you could completely solve, say, positions which had

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
[Guest]: not more than seven pieces on the board, not more than six pieces on the board,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
[Guest]: which also helped you to extrapolate backwards, you know.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
[Guest]: When you have nine pieces on the board, a computer will play almost perfectly

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
[Guest]: because it can flash to a position where there would be just seven pieces,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
[Guest]: and it knows that position is either win, loss, or draw.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000
[Guest]: So, yeah, so, yes, you worked out, but essentially this was human beings

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
[Guest]: teaching computers to sort of think like computers, but with an enormous amount

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
[Guest]: of processing power thrown in, and hence being able to calculate

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
[Guest]: in far greater depth.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
[Guest]: There was also the other thing is you would normally feed in, you know,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
[Guest]: a million games or four million games where stuff that human beings

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
[Guest]: had learned, say, opening systems, which we had discovered over the course

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
[Guest]: of a lot of practice that, you know, a certain move in the opening was

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
[Guest]: probably better than any other move in that particular position.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
[Guest]: That kind of knowledge was also fed in in terms of opening books,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000
[Guest]: which were assimilated by computers.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
[Amit Varma]: And to be clear, computers got so strong that no human could possibly beat

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
[Amit Varma]: any of the top software programs anymore.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.000
[Guest]: Oh, yes, you can take circa 2012, say, you could take a normal off-the-shelf

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000
[Guest]: Android cell phone and a free program, an early version of Stock Fix,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
[Guest]: for example, and it would have beaten a world champion, you know,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
[Guest]: 100 times out of 100.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
[Guest]: It would be the equivalent of, let's say, Usain Bolt trying to outrun

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
[Guest]: a Maruti 800.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
[Guest]: If you want to use a similar analogy, a Maruti 800 isn't a particularly

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.000
[Guest]: powerful or quick car, but it can beat a world-class splinter, hollow.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
[Amit Varma]: So, before I get to AlphaZero, I want to sort of take a digression

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
[Amit Varma]: into a subject in which you and I have had a bunch of fascinating

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
[Amit Varma]: conversations, which I found really enlightening.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
[Amit Varma]: One always assumes that when computers get into anything, it takes on

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
[Amit Varma]: almost a machine-like quality, and therefore there could be that

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
[Amit Varma]: clichéd assumption that if computers dominate chess and people are

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
[Amit Varma]: using computers to learn how to play chess, they'll all start playing

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
[Amit Varma]: in the same way, like machines.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
[Amit Varma]: But actually, as you've often pointed out at length, it's exactly the opposite.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Can you talk a little bit about that?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
[Guest]: Yeah, what happened was first it democratised teaching, because

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
[Guest]: if you had access to the internet and you had access to a half-decent,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
[Guest]: even a half-decent cell phone, you had a very powerful tool at your

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
[Guest]: command to learn how to play chess.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:43.000
[Guest]: You could look through games simply by using the machine for analysis

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
[Guest]: and see that, oh, okay, this move works, that move doesn't.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:56.000
[Guest]: And as a result, in earlier eras, what you had was chess schools.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
[Guest]: For example, the Russians or Soviets had a lot of magnificent players,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
[Guest]: and most of whom also ended up training a lot of very good players.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
[Guest]: But India, in contrast, to use an obvious example, had nothing.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
[Guest]: We didn't have good players, and we obviously did not have

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
[Guest]: good trainers as well.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
[Guest]: The only downside to this, apart from the fact that you had clusters

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
[Guest]: where you had strong chess-playing countries and you had weak

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
[Guest]: chess-playing countries, was that every human chess player

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
[Guest]: has strong biases and dogmas.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.000
[Guest]: For example, a highly tactical attacking player will tend to pass on

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:53.000
[Guest]: his assessment of positions to his pupils, who will tend to also

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
[Guest]: inherit those biases.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
[Guest]: What happened when you started having this sort of computer-aided

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
[Guest]: analysis and coaching, for want of a better word, was a democratization

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
[Guest]: where those biases largely disappeared.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
[Guest]: So you ended up having a new generation of players.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
[Guest]: They're called Fritz Kids because Fritz was one of the early programs.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
[Guest]: It's still a popular line in the chess engine programming.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
[Guest]: They were called Fritz Kids.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
[Guest]: They developed without a lot of these biases and baggage.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
[Guest]: They also discovered the other thing which we learned when computers

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
[Guest]: started playing really well was that a lot of positions which humans

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
[Guest]: would just dismiss as completely won or completely drawn actually had

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
[Guest]: possibilities which humans had not appreciated, simply because computers

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
[Guest]: could calculate at greater depth than human beings.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000
[Guest]: So you also discovered a new generation who were very hard-nosed,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
[Guest]: very concrete in terms of calculation, who would not take a value judgment

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
[Guest]: for granted.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
[Guest]: They would be prepared to play positions which earlier generations

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
[Guest]: would have considered horrible just because they knew that there was

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
[Guest]: a computer evaluation saying this position is good or this position

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
[Guest]: is even just equal.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:36.000
[Guest]: So yes, you had an enormous variation in terms of style and a lot of

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:44.000
[Guest]: modern players who play in ways which would earlier have been unclassifiable.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
[Guest]: The other thing, of course, being that you have 24-7 online forums where

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
[Guest]: you can play chess with good players at any given point of the day or night

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
[Guest]: which is comfortable for you and it doesn't matter where you're sitting.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.000
[Guest]: So again, you had, if you like, the 10,000 hours worth of practice which

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
[Guest]: an earlier generation would have had to develop over five years of trying

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
[Guest]: to play a few tournaments, etc. here and there.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
[Guest]: You had that for a new generation that was being crammed into a much

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
[Guest]: shorter actual space of time.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
[Guest]: Hence, you also had prodigies who, at the age of 13, 14, were developing

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
[Guest]: a huge amount of skill and who had styles and techniques which were

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
[Guest]: completely different from earlier generations.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
[Amit Varma]: One thing I find interesting here is not just that the variation of play

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
[Amit Varma]: has gone up among human players and something that you're now seeing

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
[Amit Varma]: as a correspondence player is that, you've often told me, is that even

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
[Amit Varma]: the machines have different styles and play differently because they've

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of evolved in different directions.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
[Guest]: Yes, this has also happened, for example, and it's something which you use

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
[Guest]: particularly in correspondence and analysis.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
[Guest]: You sort of use a shorthand, you say that, okay, this is the kind of position

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000
[Guest]: I would like to analyze with Junior because Junior is a highly tactical engine

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
[Guest]: and this is the kind of position I would like to analyze with Komodo

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
[Guest]: because Komodo is a very positional engine which looks for long-term

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
[Guest]: static advantages.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:42.000
[Guest]: Yes, you also have variations, actually, in terms of number crunchings

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
[Guest]: in that certain engines are designed to be brute force number crunchers

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.000
[Guest]: to a maximal degree, others tend to make the evaluations faster.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
[Guest]: So again, if you're doing an analysis in a limited period of time,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000
[Guest]: you would use a certain engine and you would keep switching engines

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
[Guest]: when you're looking for a human understanding of a position, that is,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:21.000
[Guest]: you want to come to a conclusion that, is this position something I can make sense of?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:29.000
[Guest]: And of course, really good players tend to also adapt engines to finding positions

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
[Guest]: that they like and that their opponents might be uncomfortable with.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
[Guest]: Let's say someone like Aronian or Carlsen is not necessarily looking for

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
[Guest]: an outright concrete advantage when he's analyzing with a computer.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
[Guest]: Aronian is looking for a position which he thinks Carlsen is not going to be comfortable in

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
[Guest]: and vice versa.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000
[Guest]: So you have these little variations which can actually be quite important

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
[Guest]: from a practical player's point of view.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
[Guest]: Yes, that has certainly happened.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
[Amit Varma]: And despite the sort of the fact that the existing computer engines or programs

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
[Amit Varma]: are different from each other, AlphaZero just seems to be a whole quantum leap ahead

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
[Amit Varma]: and one of the ways in which that is so is that it doesn't even really seem to be using brute force.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
[Amit Varma]: Instead, it seemed to have worked out its own set of heuristics,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
[Amit Varma]: some of which are very at odds with what we humans have traditionally been taught.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:38.000
[Guest]: I think one of the problems here is that until and unless DeepMind ever releases

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
[Guest]: logs of those games, and ideally logs of all 100 games which it played with Stockfish,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
[Guest]: you won't know for certain what its evaluations were.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000
[Guest]: Because if you have the log, then you know on a move-by-move basis this is how it rated,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:05.000
[Guest]: let's say it's 19 possible moves and 26 possible responses its opponent might have had.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:14.000
[Guest]: But yes, it runs slower in the sense that it seems to process far fewer positions per second.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:28.000
[Guest]: DeepMind says that it processes about 80,000 positions per second, which is orders of magnitude less

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000
[Guest]: than modern engines such as Stockfish processes millions of positions per second.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:49.000
[Guest]: There is a caveat to that match. Stockfish was playing on hardware which I don't think was really up to the mark.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000
[Guest]: And it was playing at an odd time control with a lot of constraints,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
[Guest]: but even so it would have been processing 3 or 4 million positions per second.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:08.000
[Guest]: Whereas AlphaZero was just looking at 80,000.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000
[Guest]: The second part of this is that it seems to have learned things about chess

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
[Guest]: which take its understanding to a different level.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
[Guest]: When you're looking at a computer analysis of a position,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
[Guest]: even when a computer finds a shockingly good or surprising move,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:36.000
[Guest]: it tends to be something which is practically beyond your thinking horizon

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
[Guest]: in the sense that it is seeing a combination which is 10 moves deep,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000
[Guest]: whereas as a human being your calculating ability simply doesn't go that deep.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:55.000
[Guest]: In AlphaZero's case, what it seems to have, at least in the 10 games that were released,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:03.000
[Guest]: what it seems to have found is positional evaluations where it's giving material

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:10.000
[Guest]: for what is apparently very nebulous compensation,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
[Guest]: but you go deeper and deeper and there is a point at which you realize that

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000
[Guest]: no, there is very strong compensation, but it is not tactical.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
[Guest]: It is not as though you're finding 3 sacrifices in a row and forcing mate.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:36.000
[Guest]: It is more like you're strangling your opponent with slowly depriving him of moves.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000
[Guest]: Him, again, is the wrong word to use, but you're slowly depriving your opponent of possible moves.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000
[Guest]: It is difficult to understand at that level.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
[Guest]: It's the kind of chess which you can imagine someone like Anatoly Karpov playing

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.000
[Guest]: if Karpov could analyze 80,000 moves per second.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.000
[Guest]: It seems to be an understanding which is well beyond the human.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
[Guest]: It's not based on concrete calculation in that sense.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
[Amit Varma]: On the one hand, it's not based on concrete calculations which other computers would excel at.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
[Amit Varma]: At the same time, it's not based on heuristics which humans can even understand.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm reminded of a quote on chess.com by Peter Hein Nelson,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
[Amit Varma]: who is Magnus Carlsen II and earlier used to work with Anand.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
[Amit Varma]: He said that, I've always wondered how aliens would play chess

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
[Amit Varma]: if a race of superior aliens came on to earth and played.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
[Amit Varma]: And now I think I know, which kind of reveals a sort of awe with all of us who play chess,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of looked at these games.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
[Amit Varma]: I have two questions for you now.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
[Amit Varma]: One really small and you need not spend much time on it,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
[Amit Varma]: which are what are the implications of this for chess itself?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
[Amit Varma]: And the second deeper one is,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
[Amit Varma]: what are the implications of this for AI and human life in general, the way we are going?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
[Guest]: The first one, I'm taking an analogy from Go,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
[Guest]: because AlphaZero's earlier version played Go

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
[Guest]: and then of course they worked out this method of simply letting it play against itself

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
[Guest]: and learning the rules as it goes along.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
[Guest]: What happened there is interesting in the sense that

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
[Guest]: AlphaGo, as that particular program was called,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
[Guest]: beat world champions the first time it had happened in Go,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
[Guest]: which is a much more complex game than chess.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.000
[Guest]: And well, the world champions in question then looked at those games

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
[Guest]: and computer programmers also looked at those games

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:58.000
[Guest]: and as a result a year down the line you have much better Go programs being produced commercially.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000
[Guest]: You must remember that Alpha is running on specialized hardware

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
[Guest]: with enormous computing power, but you've actually had commercial programs coming out,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
[Guest]: Crazy Stone for example, which play much better Go

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000
[Guest]: and which seem to have at least imbibed some of the principles of learning

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:28.000
[Guest]: which the AlphaZero, AlphaGo matches seem to have thrown up.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000
[Guest]: Human beings now understand Go better than they did a year ago, which is amazing

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
[Guest]: considering that Go has been played for at least, you know,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
[Guest]: there are recorded games going back 1200 years.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
[Guest]: So you suddenly have this jump.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
[Guest]: I suspect similar things will happen in chess,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
[Guest]: because people will look at these games and they will say that

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
[Guest]: oh okay, you can maybe ask a computer to do this kind of thing.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
[Guest]: The other part of this is that both in Go and chess,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
[Guest]: Alpha seems to use a lot of Monte Carlo analysis

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
[Guest]: where it randomly plays games against itself with, you know,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
[Guest]: all the possible moves in a given position which looks about equal.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.000
[Guest]: And then it sort of makes a judgment on the basis of actually playing games with itself

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
[Guest]: as opposed to merely evaluating a position.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
[Guest]: So I think you'll have some of those techniques being picked up

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000
[Guest]: and incorporated in commercial programs possibly with a fair degree of success.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000
[Guest]: I would expect a year or two down the line that computer chess in general will have got stronger

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
[Guest]: and probably human beings will have learnt a bit more.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
[Amit Varma]: And that will make even human chess so much more exciting

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
[Amit Varma]: because you'll have new styles and new sort of frontiers.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
[Guest]: Yes, and I think you'll find that, you know,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
[Guest]: there are 10-year-olds and 13-year-olds who are once again playing in ways

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
[Guest]: that even the 20-year-olds don't understand.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean the 20-year-olds play chess, the 35-year-olds don't understand.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Besides being a very active player, you've been a chess coach,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
[Amit Varma]: you've worked with people like Surya Shekhar Ganguly and Tanya Sachdev and all that,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
[Amit Varma]: and you've kind of seen these generational changes happening in any case, haven't you?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
[Guest]: Yes.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
[Guest]: Shudjo, for example, is a pre-computer era player.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
[Guest]: I mean, Shudjo is in his late 30s now,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
[Guest]: but he is a pre-computer era player in the sense that, you know,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:55.000
[Guest]: he was already a pretty strong player and by the time computers became seriously useful.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
[Guest]: Similarly with Tanya, she learned to play.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
[Guest]: I haven't really worked with Tanya, by the way.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
[Guest]: I have worked with Shandipan Tando, for example,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000
[Guest]: and I've worked with several of the, in a very random way, with several of the younger ones.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
[Guest]: There is a difference in the way they play.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
[Guest]: There is a difference in the way they play

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:26.000
[Guest]: and in the way that the average 16 and 18-year-old plays or evaluates positions nowadays.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
[Guest]: That's very clear.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
[Guest]: In general, standards have gotten much better.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.000
[Guest]: The average 1800 or 2000 LO player of today knows a lot more

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
[Guest]: and is usually self-taught to a large degree.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
[Guest]: There is a lot of coaching involved,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
[Guest]: but a lot of them are self-taught in the sense that for every hour of coaching they've had,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
[Guest]: they've played 10 hours of games with each other online

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
[Guest]: and they've worked maybe 20 hours with programs.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:12.000
[Guest]: So, you know, the coaching to playing to self-analysis ratios are very different

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
[Guest]: and they've learned a lot.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
[Guest]: They've taught themselves a lot more.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:25.000
[Guest]: I think if AlphaGo is an example, AlphaZero is an example,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
[Guest]: and it sets new boundaries,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
[Guest]: I think you will find that over the next two, three years,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
[Guest]: there will be a generation of chess players who learn even more

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
[Guest]: and who manage to incorporate some of that.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Can't wait to see those games.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on now from chess to artificial intelligence.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
[Guest]: Yes.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
[Guest]: The interesting thing there is that if you think about it,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000
[Guest]: chess, Go, Game of Life, several other such games,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
[Guest]: have very narrow, very simple rule sets.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:10.000
[Guest]: You play it by, you know, the moves as such are very narrow, very well defined.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
[Guest]: And can lead to immense amounts of complexity in practice.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
[Guest]: You have similar things happening in nature.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
[Guest]: For example, DNA...

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
[Guest]: Hello?

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
[Guest]: Yeah, I'm here.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
[Guest]: Sorry.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
[Guest]: For example, DNA combinations,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
[Guest]: according to very simple, well understood rules,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
[Guest]: things like protein folding,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
[Guest]: which is again fairly important in terms of genetics,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
[Guest]: again occurs according to fairly simple rules.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
[Guest]: The problem is that human beings cannot number crunch

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
[Guest]: the enormous number of variations that can occur

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
[Guest]: by those very simple combinations.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
[Guest]: The combinatorial possibilities, you know,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
[Guest]: go beyond the bounds of computation very quickly.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
[Guest]: In that sort of situation, something like AlphaZero

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
[Guest]: and this self-teaching method could actually come up with

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
[Guest]: basic scientific insights which we are not capable of,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
[Guest]: which we cannot program into computers

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
[Guest]: because we don't understand them ourselves.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
[Guest]: And these are also situations where even a really fast computer

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000
[Guest]: cannot solve a protein folding problem by brute force.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
[Guest]: So you have a great deal in the way of possibilities

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
[Guest]: of basic science breakthroughs

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
[Guest]: by using artificial intelligence in these areas.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
[Guest]: The other thing which is fairly useful at a practical level

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:03.000
[Guest]: is that AI is usually the first primary learning process

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
[Guest]: where you're teaching an AI to do something is very human intensive.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
[Guest]: For example, to take a very simple example,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
[Guest]: when you put an autonomous car on the road,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
[Guest]: you are feeding in tens of millions of pictures

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
[Guest]: and you're telling the car that this is an advertising billboard,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
[Guest]: this is the back of a truck,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
[Guest]: this is a human being standing on a zebra crossing,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
[Guest]: this is a human being not standing on a zebra crossing,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
[Guest]: this is a guy wearing a helmet on a bike, etc.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
[Guest]: And a human being actually has to go through this process

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
[Guest]: of teaching the AI.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
[Guest]: When it's gone wrong, one of the few fatal accidents

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
[Guest]: that have happened with autonomous cars

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
[Guest]: was when an autonomous car mistook the back of a truck

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
[Guest]: literally for an advertising billboard and tried to go under it.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
[Guest]: So you can have horrifying situations if this goes wrong.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000
[Guest]: Now, a self-teaching program like AlphaZero

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000
[Guest]: might cut the human intensive work hours

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
[Guest]: required to do this kind of programming

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
[Guest]: by orders of magnitude.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
[Guest]: And that could be very, very useful

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
[Guest]: and it is quite possible that they would do it more efficiently as well.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
[Guest]: If you're looking at this as an example,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
[Guest]: it's quite possible that in a lot of cases

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
[Guest]: they would do it more efficiently as well.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
[Guest]: If, for example, landing a spacecraft on Mars or the Moon

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
[Guest]: is completely autonomous, it has to be

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000
[Guest]: because you're seven seconds away, I think,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
[Guest]: from the Moon in terms of radio communication

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000
[Guest]: and you're more than an hour away from Mars,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.000
[Guest]: I think, if Mars is not at an average distance

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
[Guest]: between Earth and Mars.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
[Guest]: So you obviously cannot send instructions and say,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
[Guest]: now you put down your landing gear.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
[Guest]: It's completely autonomous.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
[Guest]: Now, that sort of thing,

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
[Guest]: if you could actually get the computer to teach itself,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
[Guest]: it might do it more efficiently than you do.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
[Guest]: So those are areas where I think

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
[Guest]: the specific techniques AlphaZero has come up with

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
[Guest]: could make a huge difference.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:34.000
[Guest]: Obviously, we'll have to wait and see how this is applied.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the analogy that kind of comes to mind,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, correct me if it doesn't sound right to you,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
[Amit Varma]: is that, you know, what we can do is a known-known,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
[Amit Varma]: but what computers can do with brute force, for example,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
[Amit Varma]: would be a known-unknown, that you understand the process

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
[Amit Varma]: and you understand it's possible that it's calculating all these moves.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
[Amit Varma]: So you kind of know what's going on.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
[Amit Varma]: But the self-learning kind of computers like AlphaZero

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
[Amit Varma]: are sort of an unknown-unknown.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
[Amit Varma]: We don't even understand what's going on.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I had a thinker called Ramesh Naam

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
[Amit Varma]: on this show a few months ago,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
[Amit Varma]: and he was talking about AI,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
[Amit Varma]: and he said something very interesting,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
[Amit Varma]: and he said that AI is something people talk about

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
[Amit Varma]: as if it's in the future.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, whenever what was AI yesterday

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
[Amit Varma]: actually becomes part of your life,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
[Amit Varma]: you stop calling it AI.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, our smartphones are basically

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
[Amit Varma]: the science fiction of 1990.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, the kind of GPS that is the kind of...

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, all of the technology is essentially

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
[Amit Varma]: really advanced AI from a 1990 perspective,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
[Amit Varma]: but we take it for granted.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
[Amit Varma]: And I've always looked at AI as something that adds

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
[Amit Varma]: a lot of value to human life,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
[Amit Varma]: and it's just overwhelmingly an awesome thing.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
[Amit Varma]: But there's a lot of alarmism recently,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and some of it actually comes from the self-learning nature

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
[Amit Varma]: of some of these machines and programs

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
[Amit Varma]: where people have been speculating about

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
[Amit Varma]: how these self-learning programs, so to say,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
[Amit Varma]: could develop a consciousness and even wipe us out,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, so on and so forth.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
[Amit Varma]: And how justified do you think is that kind of alarmism?

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
[Guest]: At a very practical level,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
[Guest]: you now have things like lethal autonomous weaponry.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:15.000
[Guest]: For example, you have the Israeli Iron Dome,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
[Guest]: which stops rocket attacks into Israel.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
[Guest]: It is an autonomous system.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
[Guest]: If it sees...

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
[Guest]: If it senses, rather, that there is an airborne object

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
[Guest]: approaching at a speed,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
[Guest]: it will launch its rockets to knock that out of the sky.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:42.000
[Guest]: Something similar to protect army bases in Afghanistan

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
[Guest]: at a narrower level.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000
[Guest]: The Koreans have put up what they call sentry guns,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
[Guest]: which is an autonomous weapon on a militarized zone,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
[Guest]: where if it notices a movement and it's using...

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
[Guest]: It's searching across radar, infrared, what have you.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
[Guest]: It sends out...

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
[Guest]: It actually has a mic loudspeaker which says,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
[Guest]: OK, friend or foe.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
[Guest]: And if the response does not come up

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
[Guest]: with the password of the day, so to speak,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
[Guest]: it can launch grenades, it can shoot,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
[Guest]: or it can just ring an alarm.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
[Guest]: Now, you take that one step further,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
[Guest]: it is possible to program a drone, a small drone,

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
[Guest]: with face recognition and send it out

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
[Guest]: and say that, well, if you see a guy who looks like this,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
[Guest]: shoot him or explode in his face.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
[Guest]: There was a seven-minute documentary movie

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
[Guest]: done recently for the UN conference

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
[Guest]: on conventional weapons,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
[Guest]: which demonstrated how this is possible.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
[Guest]: And you could send out swarms of these creatures,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
[Guest]: using the word loosely,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
[Guest]: and they could be programmed to, you know,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
[Guest]: fire explosive darts whenever they found somebody

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
[Guest]: who was a target.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000
[Guest]: Now, that sort of thing is already practically possible.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:27.000
[Guest]: And it's not in the realm of the self-aware and conscious

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
[Guest]: and what have you.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
[Guest]: But it is already practically possible.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
[Guest]: There are no laws against it

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
[Guest]: in terms of, say, the Geneva Convention.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
[Guest]: And obviously, many governments are tempted

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
[Guest]: to develop and deploy weaponry like this.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
[Guest]: For example, India would be very interested

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
[Guest]: in putting up something like a sentry gun

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
[Guest]: on the line of actual control.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
[Guest]: So that is one of those areas

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
[Guest]: where AI could lead very rapidly

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
[Guest]: into the realm of what is now science fictional,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000
[Guest]: but will not be in a matter of a couple of years.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
[Guest]: And that's more likely to happen than, you know,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
[Guest]: when AI develops consciousness and decides to kill all human beings.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
[Guest]: That's maybe a little far-fetched at the moment,

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
[Guest]: but an AI which is told to go out and kill everybody

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
[Guest]: who is, you know, 5 feet 9 inches,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
[Guest]: between 5 feet 9 inches and 5 feet 11 inches tall,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
[Guest]: and happens to have a skin color which is between this and this,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
[Guest]: is entirely possible.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And it could be done by rogue elements as much as military,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
[Guest]: it could be done by, you know, a bright 19-year-old

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
[Guest]: buying stuff off the shelves

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
[Guest]: and putting together a face recognition program.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, and you know, you've done a previous episode

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
[Amit Varma]: of The Seen and The Unseen with me

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
[Amit Varma]: where we spoke about privacy.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
[Amit Varma]: And another recent example of AI in my life

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
[Amit Varma]: was when I was discussing Malwani cuisine with a friend,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
[Amit Varma]: and it was not something I had searched for

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
[Amit Varma]: or looked up online or anything.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
[Amit Varma]: It was just a verbal discussion.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
[Amit Varma]: And the next time I go online,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
[Amit Varma]: there's an ad right there for Malwani cuisine on, you know,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
[Amit Varma]: whichever app I open,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
[Amit Varma]: which a lot of people kind of find eerie

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
[Amit Varma]: and others would say,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
[Amit Varma]: hey, it's a feature, not a bug.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
[Amit Varma]: In general, looking ahead at artificial intelligence,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
[Amit Varma]: would you say that the future seems more utopian

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
[Guest]: or dystopian to you?

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
[Guest]: I think technology itself tends to be morally agnostic.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
[Guest]: So it's, you know, you can use this sort of technology

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
[Guest]: equally as a force for good.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
[Guest]: So that is entirely possible,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
[Guest]: and you could use it for all sorts of things.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
[Guest]: For example, the whole thing of

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.000
[Guest]: an autonomous AI ambulance has been thought of

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
[Guest]: where, you know, it just goes there,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
[Guest]: takes a few pictures,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
[Guest]: diagnoses what the problem is,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
[Guest]: delivers emergency services.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
[Guest]: That kind of thing has already been thought up.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it could possibly get to a venue where,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, before something happens.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
[Guest]: Yes, quite possibly.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
[Guest]: If you go with the fact that, you know,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
[Guest]: there's a lot of programming happening on

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
[Guest]: using social media to figure out that,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
[Guest]: okay, somebody is suicidal, for example,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
[Guest]: and he's posting on social media,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
[Guest]: and you couldn't get there.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
[Guest]: So that kind of thing is entirely possible.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, in fact, for those who say there's no free will,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
[Amit Varma]: then everything just becomes a data crunching exercise.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
[Amit Varma]: Devangshu, thanks so much for coming on the show.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
