00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: IVM.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.360
[Amit Varma]: We behave as if we are subjects, not citizens.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.440
[Amit Varma]: As if the laws that exist in this country do so for the purpose of our overlords monitoring

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.440
[Amit Varma]: our behaviour.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.200
[Amit Varma]: Our free speech laws are a great example of this.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.780
[Amit Varma]: Section 295A, 153A and 124A are all throwbacks from the British Empire which framed the Indian

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.320
[Amit Varma]: Penal Code to keep us natives under their control.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.920
[Amit Varma]: And yet, even after independence, even 72 years after independence, we are still oppressed

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.480
[Amit Varma]: by largely the same set of laws designed to keep us in check.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.020
[Amit Varma]: Section 124A, the law against sedition, is a great example of this.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.300
[Amit Varma]: It is natural for an oppressive autocratic state to have a law such as this.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.660
[Amit Varma]: But why must a responsive democracy have a sedition law?

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.840
[Amit Varma]: It's actually the duty of citizens to constantly point out the flaws in our government, to

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.480
[Amit Varma]: speak truth to power.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.640
[Amit Varma]: We live in times where those in power actually speak of strengthening the sedition law, where

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.560
[Amit Varma]: it is used to harass dissenters and to have a chilling effect on would-be dissenters.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.520
[Amit Varma]: To speak up against this is our duty.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.520
[Amit Varma]: Is it also criminal?

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.840
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.840
[Unknown]: science.

[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.720
[Amit Varma]: My guest for today is Chitranshul Sinha, who has written a fantastic history of the sedition

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.560
[Amit Varma]: law in India, Section 124A.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.840
[Amit Varma]: His book is called The Great Repression and is basically an excellent book of history

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.600
[Amit Varma]: that places the framing of laws in the context of the political and social environments in

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.040
[Amit Varma]: which they were born, an extremely insightful book with many TIL moments.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.520
[Amit Varma]: Before I begin my conversation with Chitranshul, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.920
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art but can't really afford to have paintings

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.960
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.320

[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.000
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about yourself before we start talking about your book.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.920
[Amit Varma]: Like you know, you're a lawyer and now you've written this book, which is ostensibly a book

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.000
[Amit Varma]: about law, but it's really a book of history and an excellent one at that.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
[Amit Varma]: So what's your background?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
[Amit Varma]: Where are you from?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
[Guest]: How did you become a lawyer?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
[Guest]: So I'm from Ranchi.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
[Guest]: It's a place in Jharkhand.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.440
[Guest]: MS Dhoni fame and from the same school.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.080
[Amit Varma]: So if someone says MS Dhoni should retire, is that seditious in Jharkhand?

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.880
[Guest]: I really hope it becomes, those guys should be punished.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.880
[Guest]: So I'm from Ranchi.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.360
[Guest]: I come from a background of science.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.520
[Guest]: I was not a arts or humanities student, but then law happened by accident and even history

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.520
[Guest]: happened by accident.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.640
[Guest]: I hated history till I started reading it after college.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.260
[Guest]: So both accidental things combined into this book.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.280
[Guest]: So I studied law from Pune, Symbiosis Pune, five year course.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.240
[Guest]: Then I started practicing in 2009 and I'm an AOR of the Supreme Court and a partner

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.640
[Guest]: with a pan-India law firm.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.440
[Guest]: And this is something I do on the side to keep myself happy.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.960
[Amit Varma]: And I guess when you start studying law, initially it's a subject.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.280
[Amit Varma]: So you're looking at the textbooks and you're studying law and it's the subjects and all

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.640
[Amit Varma]: that, but it's much broader and deeper than that.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.160
[Amit Varma]: There are so many stories behind it.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.240
[Amit Varma]: And the history of law in a sense is a history of society and a history of people and all

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.280
[Amit Varma]: of that.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.000
[Amit Varma]: At what point did you start to get interested in these sort of broader aspects?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.280
[Guest]: I would say in college, in college when we were studying jurisprudence and we were studying

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.560
[Guest]: legal history, that's when I started understanding that you can't look at law in isolation.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.400
[Guest]: It doesn't operate in a vacuum.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.920
[Guest]: It has to do with what the society of that day is like.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.560
[Guest]: So you have to understand society and politics of the day to understand law.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.200
[Guest]: So you can't look at it in isolation.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.320
[Guest]: That's where I understood law.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.880
[Guest]: And then you start reading about world history and laws around the world.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.260
[Guest]: Then you understand how those things correlate with each other.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.360
[Amit Varma]: And what were the sort of great books on law or legal history that sort of influenced you?

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.040
[Guest]: So I'll confess that there's no such book which influenced me.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:48.960
[Guest]: I would have actually not read legal history as a, because I really didn't like any, started

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.200
[Guest]: some, I didn't like any other than maybe A.G.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.520
[Guest]: Noorani's great trials.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.600
[Guest]: Otherwise, I really didn't enjoy legal history books because they're very dry for my taste

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.600
[Amit Varma]: at least.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.920
[Amit Varma]: That was an interesting sort of cautionary lesson you seem to have taken because your

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.560
[Amit Varma]: book is anything but dry.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.120
[Amit Varma]: So what's the kind of stuff that you would read like intellectually, what makes you the

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.120
[Amit Varma]: person you are?

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.520
[Guest]: What are your sort of influences outside of law?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.520
[Guest]: Outside of law?

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.520
[Guest]: I don't know.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.800
[Guest]: To be honest, I actually don't have an answer for this.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.880
[Guest]: So how did the book come about?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.880
[Guest]: So I was writing columns.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.120
[Guest]: There's this very good friend of mine, Rukun, who used to work with Penguin earlier.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.360
[Guest]: And she said she thought that I would write a book I never thought I would.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.960
[Guest]: And she connected me with Mansi, who's a commissioning editor at Penguin.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.360
[Guest]: And she sort of did an inception on me.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.080
[Guest]: She told me I should pick a topic to write on.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.240
[Guest]: And I gave her five options.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.560
[Guest]: She said, you should write on sedition.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.560
[Guest]: I said, Oh, should I?

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.720
[Guest]: She said, yes, you should write on sedition.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.920
[Guest]: Now you pitch the idea to us.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.200
[Guest]: So then I thought about how to go about it.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.040
[Guest]: And then I created this structure for this book.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.760
[Guest]: And then they said, Oh, fine, we approve of your idea.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.160
[Guest]: So the idea was they themselves gave me the approval of the idea.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.520
[Guest]: And that's how that book happened.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.520
[Amit Varma]: That's very cunning.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.520
[Amit Varma]: What were the other four?

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.680
[Guest]: So I was thinking about writing of these archaic laws, which is stupid.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.840
[Guest]: One of those laws were adultery laws.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.520
[Guest]: So all these Victorian laws, which shouldn't have existed in post independence India, I

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.320
[Guest]: want to write about all those laws.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.000
[Amit Varma]: But she restricted me to this one law.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, adultery 377.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I've in fact had episodes on.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.360
[Amit Varma]: So when you decided when they asked you to pitch your idea to them, I suppose you started

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.200
[Amit Varma]: thinking about it a bit.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.840
[Amit Varma]: Was a book that you pitched to them similar to the one that you wrote?

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.440
[Guest]: It's almost identical.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.440
[Guest]: It's almost identical.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.600
[Guest]: Maybe it grew a little more in scope, in the sense that I realized that the topic is too

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.020
[Guest]: vast to restrict it to anything.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.560
[Guest]: So the general structure remained the same.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.740
[Guest]: But I added a little more bulk to the history part to the origin part.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.040
[Guest]: When I started writing, I did not realize that I would spend so much time on origin

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.200
[Guest]: or so many chapters on origin and pre independence aspects of tradition law, but it really grew

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200
[Guest]: to a huge volume.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.200
[Guest]: So I actually had to control myself stop myself from writing further on it.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.080
[Amit Varma]: No, and I found that history part especially I mean, the book is a book of history and

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.640
[Amit Varma]: I found it really fascinating because I learned stuff I didn't know about English law, how

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:17.200
[Amit Varma]: it originated, about, you know, how it evolved in colonial times, and also all the sort of

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.040
[Amit Varma]: the political and social context that you set to everything.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.960
[Amit Varma]: So once you I mean, the narrative you pitched, obviously, then is how the law has evolved

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.360
[Amit Varma]: over the centuries and where we are now.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.800
[Amit Varma]: And at that point, you realized that okay, it's going to be a bit of a book of history.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Did you read a lot of history?

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.440
[Guest]: I read history, but I did not read Indian history as much as I would have liked to.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.000
[Guest]: I usually read world history.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.160
[Guest]: And in fact, when I started writing this book, that's when I started looking at this more

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.820
[Guest]: seriously.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.960
[Guest]: And I realized there's a lot which went behind, let's say the Indian Penal Code itself.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.880
[Guest]: So by while I was writing about sedition, I realized it's very important to write about

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.880
[Guest]: the Penal Code first, because you will not understand the context of this section 124

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.920
[Guest]: a which provides for the offense of sedition, unless you actually understand how the Indian

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.140
[Guest]: Penal Code came about to be.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.440
[Guest]: And then when I started reading, to be very honest, I learned while I was researching,

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.440
[Guest]: I did not know these things before I started writing the book.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.440
[Guest]: So I was educating myself and writing at the same time.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:27.480
[Guest]: And so when I was reading that, then I realized that the laws which were in place before my

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.040
[Guest]: college draft court came in before the East India Company took complete control of Indian

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.200
[Guest]: courts and everything.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.240
[Guest]: The laws were indigenous, there was no structure.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.320
[Guest]: They were Hindus laws, they were Mohammedan laws for criminal prosecutions, they use Mohammedan

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.400
[Guest]: laws just modified a little bit to suit the Hindu subjects.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.760
[Guest]: So criminal laws, mostly Mohammedan and civil laws, mostly Hindu.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.880
[Guest]: So that the term code, which that Indian Penal Code, the term code is sort of a misnomer

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.880
[Guest]: here.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.880
[Guest]: Code usually is a compilation of existing laws.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.800
[Guest]: It's like a compendium of laws.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.040
[Guest]: But there was no such law in India, there was no such compilation to be done in India.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.160
[Guest]: But so calling it a code as such is a misnomer.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:18.220
[Guest]: But if you consider India's past, as in that most of our laws are borrowed from the English

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.560
[Guest]: common law system.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.080
[Guest]: And in that sense, yes, because it was part of the British Empire.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.800
[Guest]: So it was a code of laws, which were derived somewhat from the British Empire and then

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.040
[Guest]: somewhat from indigenous laws.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.720
[Guest]: But in the true sense, it's not a code.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.800
[Guest]: So these are things which I actually learned when I was reading about how to pitch the

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.800
[Guest]: book.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.600
[Amit Varma]: And then when I started writing the book,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.020
[Amit Varma]: And one of the like, whenever I read a book of history, one of the things that I keep

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.720
[Amit Varma]: doing is I keep going to the footnotes and I get drawn into all these rabbit holes.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.080
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing I noticed in your footnotes is that, you know, a lot of the

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:59.040
[Amit Varma]: sources are really arcane papers or arcane cases and not so much like I would have expected

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.200
[Amit Varma]: that if you're doing a book of popular history, you'll, you know, all the standard historical

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.960
[Amit Varma]: references will be there.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.560
[Amit Varma]: But your research kind of went a lot deeper than that.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.280
[Amit Varma]: So what was that process like?

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.720
[Amit Varma]: And since you're not an academic, you're a working lawyer, you know, did you go time

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.880
[Amit Varma]: to archives or libraries or did you affiliate yourself with an institution?

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.360
[Amit Varma]: Or did you have to just work it all out on your own?

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.960
[Guest]: So I had to work it all on my own.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.720
[Guest]: To be honest, I didn't go to the National Archives as other researchers or historians

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.760
[Guest]: would go on the Nehru Memorial Library.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.120
[Guest]: I was constrained as far as time's concerned.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.040
[Guest]: And so I had to budget my time accordingly.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.720
[Guest]: So the resource that I use the most was archives that were achieved, which has absolutely everything

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.080
[Guest]: in the world, you just need to know how to find it.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.880
[Guest]: So when I was researching, like you said, it's a rabbit hole.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.440
[Guest]: And that was the past I most enjoyed of the entire process.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.960
[Guest]: That was the part I most enjoyed.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.560
[Guest]: Going down that rabbit hole was very, very enjoyable, because you go to the most recent

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.520
[Guest]: source, then you trace back to the source preceding that, then you trace back to that,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.320
[Guest]: beyond that, and then you suddenly realize that you're reading books from the 19th century,

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.400
[Guest]: or the 18th century.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.440
[Guest]: And I've read texts from the 13th century and the 14th century in English, which I could

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.360
[Guest]: barely understand.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.720
[Guest]: And that's when you realize that to write a book where people don't point fingers at

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.080
[Guest]: you, you have to go to the origin.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.120
[Guest]: You can't rely on most recent history because history is colored by politics.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.480
[Guest]: History is colored by a person's bias.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.080
[Guest]: So you have to go to the source, the farthest you can go, you have to go there.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.040
[Amit Varma]: It's not easy, but you have to do it.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.400
[Amit Varma]: And just thinking about it strikes me as so mind blowing and so wonderful that, you know,

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.160
[Amit Varma]: because of the internet, regular folks like you and I actually have a shot at going to

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.360
[Amit Varma]: these basic primary older sources.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.600
[Amit Varma]: And you know, otherwise, to just get access to these kind of archives, you'd have to be

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.560
[Amit Varma]: a professional historian and so on and so forth.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.160
[Amit Varma]: And now literally anyone can I mean, I'm obviously you know, when we were talking over coffee

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.960
[Amit Varma]: before this, I recommended Dan Collins podcast, Hardcore History.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.920
[Amit Varma]: And you know, he was basically a radio broadcaster.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.520
[Amit Varma]: He wasn't a historian.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.200
[Amit Varma]: And yet he is able to produce these remarkable works of history because the world is at his

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200
[Guest]: fingertips.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.400
[Guest]: There are too many gatekeepers of knowledge today.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.040
[Guest]: Too many gatekeepers to just to enter the archives, you have to show your credentials

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.040
[Guest]: that you're a researcher of some sort like a person like you or me can't just simply

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:23.600
[Guest]: walk into it and say that I want to read something relating to the Mughal era or about Clive.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.280
[Guest]: I need to show them that yes, I'm a researcher for something.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.760
[Guest]: Otherwise, I can't go there.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.760
[Guest]: Why can't I go there?

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.360
[Guest]: Why can't people like you and me go just walk in and learn?

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.120
[Guest]: Because to be honest, the internet is a great resource and archives is an absolutely wonderful

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.120
[Guest]: resource.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.880
[Guest]: And I so in fact, I while I was reading it, I felt so bad about using it so much that

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.840
[Guest]: I actually started donating to it.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.120
[Guest]: And we have to do that.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.740
[Guest]: Otherwise, we won't get those resources.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:52.640
[Guest]: And even though it's a huge resource, still archives have certain things which you will

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.400
[Guest]: not find in public, like the original draft penal code.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.200
[Guest]: When I was started writing the book, it took me four months to actually find it.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.360
[Guest]: And that to online.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.280
[Guest]: I don't know whether it's in some library or not.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.720
[Guest]: But all the people I talked to and I told them I have the original, I have the draft

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.200
[Guest]: penal code of Macaulay's code of 1933 and 1937.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.040
[Guest]: And they said, How did you get it?

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.040
[Guest]: People don't know it.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.440
[Guest]: People haven't read what's written there.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.680
[Guest]: They haven't seen his notes.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.160
[Guest]: And there are things like we know that Macaulay drafted it.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.680
[Guest]: But there's another person called Bethune, who also came up with a draft code.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.680
[Guest]: He hated Macaulay.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.160
[Guest]: He said, I want to do my own thing.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.720
[Guest]: And he paced this draft code to the East India Company, to the government then and he said,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.960
[Guest]: my code is better, but it was very conservative and very, the punishments were very draconian.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.600
[Guest]: So they eventually junked it.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.560
[Guest]: So before writing it, I did not know that such a draft code existed.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.080
[Guest]: Why don't we know this?

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.380
[Guest]: Because we're not allowed to go into those places to learn about it.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:54.400
[Guest]: So we need open access, like archives helps, but we need open access to our libraries,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.400
[Guest]: all these archives.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.600
[Guest]: We do otherwise, it's not going to work.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.120
[Guest]: People are today, especially in today when people unlearn the history from WhatsApp and

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.640
[Guest]: from social media, they need to go to these places to verify themselves.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.440
[Guest]: Otherwise, what they're relying on is again, bad information.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.800
[Amit Varma]: And I guess very newbie question, I guess in an ideal world, what all the archives and

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.240
[Amit Varma]: all these repositories of documents should do is digitize everything put it up for free.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely. Is that kind of happening or are the gatekeepers holding first?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.880
[Guest]: See where the laws are beyond the copyright period, I think they can still be it's happening.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.040
[Guest]: But most people will see I still understand the author has to get the royalty and everyone

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.280
[Guest]: has to be paid for what they published.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:38.360
[Guest]: But their articles like JSTOR is expensive for even for a person like me, I could not

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.960
[Guest]: afford to have all those articles.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.360
[Guest]: So I used to rely on more four or five free articles a month.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.860
[Guest]: That's how bad it is.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:49.080
[Guest]: You have people who submit these papers, academic papers, and they themselves have to buy it

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.080
[Guest]: back.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.840
[Guest]: They don't have access to even the PDFs.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.800
[Guest]: So even to get the PDFs, they have to buy it back.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.480
[Guest]: Why is it so expensive?

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.560
[Guest]: A person who's himself written something, he should get free access to it, even he's

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.440
[Guest]: not getting free access to it.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.240
[Guest]: So today, these things which if an author wants to put it out in public, he should be

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.000
[Guest]: allowed to if he doesn't want to earn out of it.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.240
[Guest]: Fine, I understand the publishers put in money.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.480
[Guest]: But beyond a period of time, you should make this knowledge public.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.440
[Guest]: Otherwise, you're not going to learn otherwise, misinformation will keep spreading without

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.440
[Guest]: verification.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.440
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.440
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, I'm not sure that making everything available does anything about misinformation,

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.720
[Amit Varma]: because misinformation spreads because people want to be misinformed.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.720
[Amit Varma]: That's also true.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:34.960
[Amit Varma]: And because they're just lazy, and they want to read the latest slice of WhatsApp history.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.560
[Amit Varma]: Let's let's kind of go to your book now.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:43.720
[Amit Varma]: And your book really starts off with the East India Company coming to India.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.560
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing here, of course, is that there's no India as such there are

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.240
[Amit Varma]: many different princely states, and they come as traders and they're given trading rights

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.480
[Amit Varma]: and then negotiating their way through it.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And I found it pretty interesting how they are gradually trying to figure out what laws

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.520
[Amit Varma]: apply to them, what laws apply to them for internal disputes, what laws apply to them

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.180
[Amit Varma]: on ships and on the land, what you know, how do they, if there's a dispute between them

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.000
[Amit Varma]: and locals, what happens?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.800
[Guest]: Can you sort of elaborate a bit on?

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.800
[Guest]: Yes.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.360
[Guest]: So yes, when the East India Company came is very interesting, actually.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.960
[Guest]: So we used to keep reading about these factories that they had set up.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.880
[Guest]: So it's not a manufacturing factory.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.940
[Guest]: It's a place where East India Company's factors established the trade.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.760
[Guest]: Factors were people who would trade with the indigenous native traders, and then send some

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.920
[Amit Varma]: back home and then bring stuff here.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.840
[Amit Varma]: So factors are basically like the agents like agents, the ship comes, it leaves the factors,

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.720
[Amit Varma]: and negotiate, we will sell you this, we will buy this.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.720
[Guest]: Yes, they're like middlemen, mostly.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.760
[Guest]: And that's how the term factory comes in.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.640
[Guest]: Now that term where what they use a Surat factory and the Madras factory, that's how

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.720
[Guest]: the term factory comes in.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:52.200
[Guest]: And when they got their factories, they realized that they have to fortify these factories.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.200
[Guest]: So they got their own militia, let's call them the militia, they are not like really

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.000
[Guest]: British soldiers, they're militia, private mercenaries.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.480
[Guest]: So they got them, they set up these forts, and they set up their own communities.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.280
[Guest]: But the trouble was that there was life beyond these communities also, they would try life

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.720
[Guest]: beyond these four walls, which was called referred to as a Mofasil.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.400
[Guest]: So that term still exists when we call when we talk about Mofasil towns, that small town

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:23.840
[Guest]: in India, they use the term Mofasil to be places which are beyond these limits of these

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.080
[Guest]: presidency towns, like beyond Bombay or beyond Madras, the presidency towns, I'm not talking

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.960
[Guest]: about the region in general, I'm just talking about town.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:37.800
[Guest]: Even for example, Bombay, what you call town today, fort today was actually what the town

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.880
[Guest]: of Bombay was beyond that it was not Bombay.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.200
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, it was Mofasil.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.960
[Guest]: Yes, Thane was Mofasil, Dadar was Mofasil.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:52.960
[Guest]: So even in Calcutta, the town was presidency controlled by the president of the factory.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.240
[Guest]: And anything beyond that, like Murshidabad, Hooghly, everything was Mofasil.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:03.960
[Guest]: So trouble started when there were disputes between Indians and the British or there were

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.400
[Guest]: disputes amongst the British themselves.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.320
[Guest]: There was confusion that how what law should apply initially started with if someone did

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.520
[Guest]: something some British citizen did something on a ship, then yes, a martial law could be

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.520
[Guest]: applied.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.520
[Guest]: But what if he did something on land, what law would apply?

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.080
[Guest]: So there was confusion.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:26.840
[Guest]: So there's a very interesting incident where the East India Company and the British courts,

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.640
[Guest]: the presidency courts had a major conflict.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:36.520
[Guest]: And there was a zamindar who was being prosecuted by the British courts, like when I say British

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.480
[Guest]: courts, not the East India Company courts, and was being protected by the company troops

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.160
[Guest]: and the company courts.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.640
[Guest]: So then they realized they changed the law eventually.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.840
[Guest]: And they said that, okay, fine, if you are a British citizen, or there are disputes between

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.400
[Guest]: two British citizens, then the British law would apply.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.520
[Guest]: But if you're an Indian citizen, and it's just something criminal in nature, then Nizami

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.240
[Guest]: laws would apply, which is a leftover from the Mughals.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.840
[Guest]: So this actually continued till very, very late.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.160
[Guest]: This continued till I would say the latter part of the 19th century.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.320
[Amit Varma]: So it was all about even after the IPC was no after the IPC.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.440
[Guest]: So IPC only extended to presidency towns.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.800
[Guest]: So all these princely states and autonomous provinces had their own laws.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.800
[Guest]: The other had its own.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:27.720
[Guest]: Yeah, like, I don't know what other but Jammu and Kashmir, for example, the Ranbir Penal

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.720
[Guest]: Code.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.960
[Guest]: It's till date, they have their own penal code, which I am assuming will go now.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.920
[Guest]: So they had their own systems and all such as in place.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.240
[Amit Varma]: Like you mentioned about how eventually, the East India Company evolved to a status where

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.840
[Amit Varma]: they looked after what you call the Diwani rights, which is a civil justice system, the

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.320
[Amit Varma]: revenue rights and the Nizami or the criminal justice powers remained with the Nizam and

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.320
[Amit Varma]: his administrators.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:58.480
[Amit Varma]: Another very interesting part of the book was as far as local laws are concerned, how

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:04.160
[Amit Varma]: the locals were sort of administered was that as far as civil laws or personal laws are

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.280
[Amit Varma]: concerned depends on you know, the Hindus had their own thing, the Muslims have their

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.280
[Unknown]: own thing.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.240
[Amit Varma]: But as far as a criminal justice system was concerned, it was a Mohammedan law which sort

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.240
[Guest]: of applied.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.280
[Guest]: Yes, but that was true for the natives, not for British subjects.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.520
[Guest]: If there was a British subject under prosecution, he had to be prosecuted by a presidency court,

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.800
[Guest]: or if a company could prosecuted him, then it had to be done according to British laws.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.320
[Amit Varma]: So how did sort of then these laws evolve?

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.080
[Amit Varma]: So initially, the East India Company comes, they're only traders, they've got factors

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.440
[Amit Varma]: in there, these factors and eventually the you know, factories are made, the militia

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.000
[Amit Varma]: comes in to look after them, you have these towns coming, the presidency is coming up

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.440
[Amit Varma]: with the Mofasil around them.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.440
[Amit Varma]: How are the laws evolving?

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.840
[Amit Varma]: Initially, it's okay, if there's a dispute between two British guys, the British laws

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.080
[Amit Varma]: apply if it's on a ship, it's martial law.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.800
[Amit Varma]: But then eventually you become a part of the local society which had has its own thing

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.760
[Amit Varma]: going on where, you know, they have their own criminal laws, their own whatever, through

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.520
[Amit Varma]: the period that the East India Company was here until the IPC, the IPC, of course, came

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.520
[Amit Varma]: 1861, I think.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, IPC was 1860.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:11.000
[Amit Varma]: So until that point in time, how has it evolved in the centuries before that?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.160
[Guest]: So there were laws, it's not as if they did not have specific statutes, even in areas

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.640
[Guest]: controlled by the company, they had certain laws.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.920
[Guest]: So there were regulations, there were things called the Bombay regulations, there were

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.000
[Guest]: things called the Madras regulations and Bengal regulations.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.640
[Guest]: For criminal law, Bengal regulations were mostly used even in Bombay and Madras for

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.240
[Guest]: criminal prosecutions and criminal justice system.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.680
[Guest]: So they had regulations, they had some random laws for certain things.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.440
[Guest]: So it's not as if they did not have any laws.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.840
[Guest]: They had these statutes, which were typically derived from British laws, the common law

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:49.720
[Guest]: system, because England does not have a typical legal system where everything is in the books.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:56.080
[Guest]: It evolves from the law of the courts, a court decides something, it becomes a law.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.560
[Guest]: It's not the other way around that, like in India, the statute dictates what the court

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.560
[Guest]: can do.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.760
[Guest]: But in England, the courts dictated what the law became.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.800
[Amit Varma]: It's what you call the common law system.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.800
[Amit Varma]: Common law system.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.720
[Guest]: So there's no origin document as such, it just evolves over a period of time.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.120
[Guest]: Yes, so but there were laws, there were these regulations, which kept getting modified from

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.500
[Guest]: time to time to suit the need of the hour.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.920
[Guest]: So it's not as if they did not have anything, they had laws, but yeah, it was not uniform

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.920
[Guest]: across the country.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:29.680
[Guest]: So for example, in the Calcutta presidency, Bengal presidency, the punishment for forgery

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.280
[Guest]: was death.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.840
[Guest]: Similarly, and for example, if you steal one rupee and the punishment is 10 years, stealing

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.800
[Guest]: 1000 rupees also 10 years, stealing 1 lakh is also 10 years.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.000
[Guest]: So it's it was not proportionate at all.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.880
[Guest]: So that is something which Macaulay also wanted to reform.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.860
[Guest]: He points out that these laws number one that for the same offense, there's no proportionality

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.380
[Guest]: with regard to the gravity of the offense.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:57.440
[Guest]: Then there are certain offenses which disturbed the local populations view.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.440
[Guest]: So basically, it's something which even today, religious law or a customary law, you may

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.000
[Guest]: feel that no, it's necessary to have such a law like Sati when Sati was being banned,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:14.880
[Guest]: it led to a huge uproar when the age of consent to have intercourse was raised from 10 to

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.880
[Guest]: 12.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.520
[Guest]: It led to the first sedition trial in 1891.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.000
[Guest]: So even people at that point of time, there were major discrepancies.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.240
[Amit Varma]: Like one of the interesting cases that you've written about in your book is King versus

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.480
[Amit Varma]: Maharaja Nand Kumar, yes, which is his root called Nand Kumar, who gets into this sort

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.000
[Amit Varma]: of ego battle with Warren Hastings.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.680
[Guest]: Tell me a bit about how that panned out.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.560
[Guest]: So it's been referred to as a judicial murder in history.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.440
[Guest]: It's been referred to as judicial murder.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:47.480
[Guest]: The Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court was Elijah M. Pei and him and Hastings were

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.480
[Guest]: buddies.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:56.440
[Guest]: And Nand Kumar was a native who rose to a status of a Diwan and was referred to as Raja

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.120
[Guest]: and he became very rich.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.560
[Guest]: And he made allegations against Hastings, corruption allegations against Hastings, which

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.560
[Guest]: was absolutely true.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.720
[Guest]: At that point of time, it was true.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:12.440
[Guest]: But to cut him to size, Hastings and M. Pei colluded and they accused him of forgery.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.920
[Guest]: And like I said, forgery was punishable with death.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.800
[Guest]: So they got together and it was a farce of a trial.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.960
[Guest]: He did not receive proper legal representation.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:25.440
[Guest]: He did not allow the proper lawyers or he was not allowed to plead his case properly.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.280
[Guest]: The evidence was murky at best.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.480
[Guest]: And they got together to kill him.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.960
[Guest]: To be honest, if I can just put it that way, they got together to kill him.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.720
[Guest]: I mean, he was convicted for forgery and he was sentenced to death.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.760
[Guest]: It was referred to as a judicial murder, which raised uproar even back in London.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.960
[Guest]: The parliament talked about it.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:49.560
[Guest]: Even in India, there was this popular sympathy for Nand Kumar for what he was going through.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.440
[Guest]: And actually showed at that point of time that there was a technical aspect involved

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.880
[Guest]: within Nand Kumar could be even tried under British laws.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.360
[Guest]: Because like I said, he was a native who did not live in Calcutta.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.720
[Guest]: He was from Murshidabad.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.360
[Guest]: And the British law did not apply to the natives of Murshidabad.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.040
[Guest]: So what they did was they arrested him in Calcutta.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:15.360
[Guest]: And they tried him under British laws under these tyrannical laws.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:21.040
[Guest]: And as a result, a lot of natives left the presidency town.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.520
[Guest]: They just ran to these Mufsul towns, because they thought that even for a minor crime,

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.080
[Guest]: they could be executed.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.520
[Amit Varma]: So there was an exodus from Calcutta after Nand Kumar's case.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.360
[Amit Varma]: And since it was being discussed in parliament and Hastings, of course, was very controversial

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.360
[Unknown]: back home.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.120
[Amit Varma]: So eventually impeached eventually impeached.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:44.240
[Amit Varma]: Was there a sort of one did it lead to a great rise in disaffection among the local people?

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.880
[Amit Varma]: And to did the British themselves feel that, hey, we got to, you know, chill out a bit

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.840
[Guest]: and get this under control.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:56.160
[Guest]: So Hastings and MP, they were instrumentalities of the British crown, the East India Company

00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.500
[Guest]: as such the other officers of the East India Company were more sympathetic to Nand Kumar.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:06.040
[Guest]: So in fact, there was a huge conflict between company officers and these British instrumentalities.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:12.160
[Guest]: Now, when that happened, they actually did realize that there was an exodus of the natives

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.880
[Amit Varma]: from Calcutta from Calcutta to Mufsul places.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.320
[Guest]: So they realize that and when they when they go out people stopping revenue when if they

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.680
[Guest]: don't like you, they would rather pick up arms rather than pay revenue to you.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.840
[Guest]: And they relied on that revenue, they relied on trade.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.680
[Guest]: So a message was sent that this shouldn't have been done.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.080
[Guest]: A message was sent across Hastings was eventually recalled.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.680
[Guest]: So yes, there were definitely was conflict.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.440
[Guest]: And it did subsist for some time.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.680
[Guest]: But at the end of the day, there was no India as such then.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.100
[Guest]: So there was no unity as such.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.520
[Guest]: So it was more like a dispute between Nand Kumar and the crown than anything else.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.240
[Guest]: So people eventually got around.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.400
[Unknown]: So it's just, you know, new cycles.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.440
[Unknown]: Just like today, people move on to outrage about something else.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.600
[Amit Varma]: Let's let's kind of, you know, before we sort of dive into the 19th century in India and

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.960
[Amit Varma]: the birth of the IPC, let's, you know, you have a chapter in your book about Bentham

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.960
[Amit Varma]: Mill and Macaulay and the impact that they had on British law, especially Bentham and

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.040
[Amit Varma]: his impact on British law.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:18.080
[Amit Varma]: Now, you've spoken about English law, and you've spoken about English law as basically

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.160
[Amit Varma]: something that has evolved through this process of spontaneous order and has come down through

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.080
[Amit Varma]: the years, a common law system.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.720
[Amit Varma]: And then, but Bentham is a seminal figure and how it evolves.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.400
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.480
[Guest]: So Bentham is a person who is responsible for the term codification.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.720
[Guest]: So in fact, let me correct you there.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:41.200
[Guest]: Bentham did not have that big an influence on English laws than he had on other countries

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.720
[Guest]: laws, mostly on French law.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.600
[Guest]: He had a huge influence on French law, then that which extended to the colony of Louisiana

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.240
[Guest]: and America, which was governed by the French back then.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:57.600
[Guest]: So his influence actually was more on French and Indian law than English law because the

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.800
[Guest]: English still don't have a criminal code.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.360
[Amit Varma]: In fact, there's an interesting quote in your book about how Bentham saying that he's a

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.360
[Amit Varma]: royalist in England, but a Republican in France.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.280
[Guest]: So Bentham lived through the revolution there.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.920
[Guest]: So Bentham is a very interesting character.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.680
[Guest]: Bentham opposed, he was a rebel of the day.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.480
[Guest]: He was not like a glamorous rebel, but he was a intellectual rebel.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.920
[Guest]: There was this gentleman called Blackstone.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.980
[Guest]: We still read Blackstone's law dictionary in India and everywhere across the world.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.720
[Guest]: So Blackstone was considered an authoritative figure on criminal law and Bentham completely

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.800
[Guest]: disagreed with him.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:37.160
[Guest]: And he said that I would, he actually said things like, I want to burn the statutes of

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.160
[Guest]: England.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.800
[Guest]: I want to burn this law down and build something new.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.480
[Guest]: And he did not find popular acceptance in England.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:49.480
[Guest]: So he actually went to France, he was depressed, he went to France and he built on that, his

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:54.400
[Guest]: philosophy there, like for the greatest, the greater good for everyone, the greater utilitarian

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.840
[Guest]: philosophy.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.600
[Guest]: And that's where codification began.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.240
[Guest]: Bentham himself wasn't very successful, if I can say so, but his followers, his disciples

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.640
[Guest]: are more successful than him.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.280
[Guest]: Because they actually put this to work.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:12.080
[Guest]: Like Mill was a Bentham follower, Macaulay not so much, even though he does borrow from

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.320
[Guest]: Bentham, but he was not like a Benthamite as much as Mill was.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:22.200
[Guest]: But eventually the system of codification was something which Bentham envisaged.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.320
[Guest]: And today we are actually having the benefit of that.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.520
[Amit Varma]: So what's the rationale behind codification?

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:33.680
[Amit Varma]: Like why did Bentham feel that he wanted to burn all that there was before and that codification

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:38.460
[Amit Varma]: was, I mean, you spoke of burning and there's an aside that in 1953, Ambedkar said that

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.760
[Amit Varma]: looking at what the constitution has become today, I feel like burning it.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.760
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:47.440
[Amit Varma]: But which is completely unrelated to all of this and not seditious in the least.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.840
[Amit Varma]: So to get back to my question about Bentham, what was it about law as it then was in England

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.240
[Amit Varma]: that he wanted to burn and what was the necessity?

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.880
[Amit Varma]: What was the rationale for needing to codify something?

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.360
[Guest]: So if laws are not codified, it leads to confusion.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.360
[Guest]: It leads to uncertainty.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.000
[Guest]: We are lucky we got the IPC.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
[Guest]: I am saying so.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
[Guest]: We are very lucky we got the IPC.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.880
[Guest]: It's a great gift from the English to us.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:14.360
[Guest]: In the sense of the concept of codification, what the code itself is, you can debate.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.360
[Guest]: Correct.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.920
[Guest]: The concept of codification was excellent for India because we are very diverse.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.000
[Guest]: We had different traditions, customs across the country.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.880
[Guest]: Like I said, indigenous laws are completely different.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.120
[Guest]: Someone in the kingdom of Travancore or Mysore might have something completely different

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:34.440
[Guest]: for Thaib, which may be different in the central provinces.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:39.200
[Guest]: And there are certain things, maybe offenses in one part, not an offense in another part.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:44.880
[Guest]: So it was very important to have a uniform system of penal law.

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.320
[Guest]: Everyone needed to be on the same page where they knew what they can do and what they could

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.680
[Guest]: not do.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.440
[Guest]: That is where codification becomes important.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.680
[Guest]: Without a code, you would have 100 different statutes in 100 different parts.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.000
[Guest]: And then there's some overlap, then there's confusion.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
[Guest]: So at the end of the day, for certainty in law, you need a code.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.200
[Guest]: So India has the civil procedure code, the criminal procedure code, which the criminal

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:13.520
[Guest]: procedure code came later after the IPC was enacted and CPC also came later.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:19.040
[Guest]: But at the end of the day, these codes have had a major impact or rather they've shaped

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.640
[Guest]: the Indian judicial system.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.800
[Guest]: Procedure is derived from the criminal procedure and the civil procedure codes.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.520
[Guest]: Penal offenses are derived from the IPC.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.680
[Guest]: Now we have penal offenses, other statutes as well, but there's no overlap in many cases.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.680
[Guest]: Most cases there's no overlap.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.320
[Guest]: In certain cases, there may be overlap, but then they're very, very specific in nature.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.600
[Guest]: Like you were just discussing about the UAPA and IPC.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.200
[Guest]: Like UAPA is very specific in nature.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.640
[Guest]: That's why as opposed to 124, which is general in nature.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:52.360
[Guest]: So but at the end of the day, mostly we have certainty, which was how a code becomes helpful

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.520
[Amit Varma]: in India or anywhere else.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.120
[Amit Varma]: So essentially, you're saying the importance of a code basically is that the rule of law

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.120
[Amit Varma]: needs to be both transparent and accountable and predictable.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.560
[Amit Varma]: And once you have a specific code out there, everyone knows what the rules of the game

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.560
[Amit Varma]: are.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.560
[Guest]: Yes.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:07.560
[Guest]: But England doesn't have a code.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.800
[Guest]: Yes, England doesn't have a code and they suffered because of it for a very long time.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.920
[Guest]: There was a lot of confusion because of common law.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.040
[Guest]: I don't consider myself an authority on that.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:21.040
[Guest]: But broadly from what I've researched, there was no certain consistency in law, which they

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.880
[Guest]: have remediated to a certain extent now, because earlier there were no statutes as such also.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.000
[Guest]: Now there are specific statutes for certain things.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.040
[Guest]: At the end of the day, like a money laundering or a bribery has a separate statute, money

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.640
[Guest]: laundering has a separate statute, offense against the state has a separate statute.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.360
[Guest]: So they have these separate statutes for these specific laws, but they haven't brought it

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.360
[Guest]: together.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.360
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.960
[Amit Varma]: Let's sort of get back to Bentham.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.080
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, one of his protégés was James Mill.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.960
[Amit Varma]: And as you point out, you know, through his 40s, and then gradually as he turns 50, he

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.480
[Amit Varma]: becomes sort of the, you know, one of the key bureaucrats in charge of India who sort

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.080
[Amit Varma]: of looking into Indian affairs.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.560
[Amit Varma]: And he sort of influences the birth of the IPC in the future.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.440
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that and the role he played.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:11.060
[Guest]: So Mill was in India house and he was responsible for communication between the East India Company

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.060
[Guest]: and the parliament.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.760
[Guest]: He was sort of a go between and a very important go between.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.360
[Guest]: In fact, he wrote, which he himself calls a seminal history of India, but he had never

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.000
[Guest]: been to India.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.960
[Guest]: So historians have a lot of problem with his history, but he did write a history of India

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.960
[Amit Varma]: as well.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.960
[Amit Varma]: So he was coming here.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.000
[Guest]: In fact, you have a long snide remark by Macaulay on his history.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.480
[Guest]: So and Macaulay and Mill, in fact, didn't get along at all.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.600
[Guest]: Macaulay very, very famously in parliament when the reforms were going, the charter reforms

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:45.480
[Guest]: were happening, he made very, very accusatory statements about Mill saying that this person

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.640
[Guest]: does not even know the, he has never been to the country, doesn't know history, but

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:51.000
[Guest]: he's written a book on history on Indian law.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.820
[Guest]: And it's very interesting because when they decided to form the first law commission,

00:34:54.820 --> 00:35:00.920
[Guest]: they wanted to send someone there and Macaulay and the East India Company did not get along

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.400
[Guest]: again because he was a member of parliament, a very young one at that.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.080
[Guest]: He was in his early thirties, was in his early thirties.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.160
[Guest]: And he used to criticize the East India Company about everything that they were doing in India.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.000
[Guest]: So, and Mill also did not get along with Macaulay.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.480
[Guest]: So it was very surprising that when they eventually had the reforms, then the chart, 1830s, the

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:25.680
[Guest]: charter reforms happened and they decided to have the first law commission and they

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.960
[Guest]: asked for Mill who they should appoint as the first law commissioner, he recommended

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.520
[Guest]: Macaulay, despite having all his differences with him.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.320
[Guest]: And it was not taken well by the company.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:41.440
[Guest]: So Mill actually had to convince the directors to send Macaulay and their relationship improved

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.280
[Guest]: after that, they prepared after that.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.840
[Guest]: It's very interesting that two people on the opposite ends of an issue work together to

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.840
[Guest]: get us the court.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.240
[Guest]: Why did he want Macaulay?

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.680
[Guest]: Because he had a lot of belief in Macaulay's intellectual capacity.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.400
[Guest]: And he respected Macaulay for that.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:01.360
[Guest]: Personally, they may have animosity, but he respected Macaulay for his intellectual capacity.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:07.080
[Amit Varma]: And what was Macaulay's approach to like 1833, the commission was set up to sort of draft

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.080
[Amit Varma]: the IPC.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:12.000
[Amit Varma]: He took around four years to do it and working practically alone, as you point out, without

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
[Amit Varma]: any assistant.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.600
[Amit Varma]: What was his approach given that he's not exactly writing on a blank slate?

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.760
[Amit Varma]: Because India, though it's not India then, but India as it is, then the lands that he's

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:26.360
[Amit Varma]: making this legal code for is like you pointed out, so diverse, they have so many different

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.240
[Amit Varma]: kinds of customs and traditions and peoples and ways of doing things.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.520
[Amit Varma]: So what are the sort of unifying principles which he brings to bear on that?

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:39.120
[Guest]: So like I said, we had regulations then so it was not really a clean slate.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.880
[Guest]: But he had a major issue with those regulations.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.800
[Guest]: And in his notes, he mentions that there's not a lot of popular support for a penal code

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.000
[Guest]: in India.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.440
[Guest]: That is one of the reasons why the code did not come into effect for 30 years after it

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.800
[Guest]: was originally drafted.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.880
[Guest]: So when he was looking at the law in his notes, he mentions when he was sending it to Auckland

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:03.440
[Guest]: for his consideration, he mentions that he's studied other indigenous laws, he studied

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:08.960
[Guest]: these regulations, and he feels that he does not have anything to refer to, to create these

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.960
[Guest]: laws.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.280
[Guest]: He feels that nothing is reliable.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:17.920
[Guest]: So he actually goes back on old English laws and common law in place there.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.800
[Guest]: And that is why I said that it's not technically a code because this is not something which

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.800
[Guest]: was brought together.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.080
[Guest]: It's not a product of bringing together of Indian laws, indigenous laws.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.320
[Guest]: It's a foreign product at the end of the day.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.680
[Amit Varma]: So typically, a code would be that you take a bunch of existing laws and you make sense

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.680
[Guest]: of them rationalize them.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.680
[Guest]: Just put it in a box.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.680
[Guest]: Just put it in a box.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.680
[Guest]: This is almost sui generis.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.680
[Guest]: He's having to come up with...

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.800
[Guest]: He had to come up with a lot of things.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.800
[Guest]: And that too without help.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:43.560
[Guest]: Like I said, almost all the members were sick or back in England or just did not do any

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.560
[Amit Varma]: work.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.560
[Amit Varma]: So what are his guiding principles?

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:49.440
[Amit Varma]: He of course was an influence, I guess, the whole utilitarian funda is there.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.120
[Amit Varma]: But what are his guiding principles otherwise?

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.720
[Guest]: His guiding principle mostly was proportionality and certainty.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.720
[Guest]: He wanted that.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.120
[Guest]: And he wanted clear categories of offenses to be created.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:06.240
[Guest]: If you look at the draft code, it's arranged in a way in which if you're talking about

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.800
[Guest]: laws against the human body, then they all club together like we have in the IPC today.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.320
[Guest]: It comes from there.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.240
[Guest]: So he wanted extreme clarity as far as application of penal laws was concerned.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.800
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you sum it up very nicely where by quoting McCauley when McCauley says about

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:27.040
[Amit Varma]: the IPC quote, our principle is simply this uniformity where you can have it diversity

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.400
[Amit Varma]: where you must have it.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.600
[Amit Varma]: But in all cases, certainty, stop quote.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.440
[Amit Varma]: And this principle was new at the time and is still the driving force.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.720
[Guest]: It is the driving force, driving force for most laws in India today, that we have to

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.000
[Amit Varma]: have certainty as far as laws are concerned.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.720
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a short commercial break now and let's come back and talk more about McCauley

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.200
[Amit Varma]: and colonial India.

[Unknown]: And with that, let's get you on with your show.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.280
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen, I'm chatting with Chitranshul Sinha about his

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:14.760
[Amit Varma]: excellent book The Great Repression, the story of sedition in India.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:20.280
[Amit Varma]: And we've just spent 40 minutes talking not about sedition per se, but other general matters.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:26.360
[Amit Varma]: So now we get the first glimpse of sedition in the draft IPC, which is created by Macaulay.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:32.840
[Amit Varma]: And this is clause 113 of the draft code, which basically I'll just read out this bit

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.360
[Amit Varma]: very similar to what later became the sedition law.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:41.480
[Amit Varma]: Quote, whoever by words either spoken or intended to be read or by signs or by visible representation,

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.120
[Amit Varma]: attempts to excite feelings of this affection to the government established by law in the

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.040
[Amit Varma]: territories of the East India Company among any class of people who live under that government

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:53.120
[Amit Varma]: shall be punished with banishment for life or any other term from the territories of

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:57.000
[Amit Varma]: the East India Company, to which fine may be added or with simple imprisonment for a

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.480
[Amit Varma]: term which may extend to three years to which fine may be added or with fine.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.960
[Amit Varma]: Stop code that was one sentence.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.000
[Guest]: Yeah, you lawyers really love your clauses.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
[Guest]: Oh, yes.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.280
[Guest]: That's how we earn our money because no one else understands it.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.280
[Amit Varma]: So did you did you while while you were writing this book, which is written in extremely readable

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.960
[Amit Varma]: and interesting language, did you have to stop yourself from putting clauses in long

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.760
[Guest]: sentences many times?

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.480
[Guest]: Many many times I had to control I had to unlearn whatever I had ever learned to write

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.480
[Guest]: this book.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.240
[Guest]: And even to read the law, I had to stop many times to understand what they had originally

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.240
[Amit Varma]: written.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.240
[Amit Varma]: So were you you know, just to continue with this brief digression, were you did you like

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.240
[Amit Varma]: to write before this?

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.160
[Amit Varma]: Did you ever think of yourself as a future writer?

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.160
[Guest]: Oh, yes, I did.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.160
[Guest]: Always.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.880
[Guest]: I always thought of myself as a novelist.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.040
[Guest]: I had these stupid novel ideas in my head.

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.680
[Guest]: There was since I was in school, but that never happened.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:51.960
[Guest]: So you would write Yeah, I used to edit my the college law review and I started writing

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:56.120
[Guest]: articles for digital publications two years back.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:00.320
[Guest]: And yes, I would write and I always loved writing and reading but I never thought that

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.480
[Guest]: I would write a book so soon and that too on a legal history topic.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.040
[Guest]: I always thought my first book would be a novel but sadly it was not.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.360
[Amit Varma]: The first book reads like a novel.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit now this is the first glimpse of the sedition law and the interesting

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.600
[Amit Varma]: thing I found from your book is that you know Britain did not have a sedition law.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:22.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, you write court rather than have a single offense called sedition.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:29.560
[Amit Varma]: Seditious offenses were categorized as seditious words, seditious labels and seditious conspiracies.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.800
[Amit Varma]: Subcourt and yet the need for it was felt in India.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.920
[Guest]: Tell me a bit about why that is so.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.480
[Guest]: So I'll just go back a little bit.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:44.760
[Guest]: Why this is important is that you have to understand how this law was born in England

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.680
[Guest]: till the 13th century.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:52.400
[Guest]: There was no uniformity of government or no uniformity of control or even the crown wasn't

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.400
[Guest]: respected.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:43:00.960
[Guest]: The crown was essentially just seen as a useful instrument of organization not more than that

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:07.040
[Guest]: and the state and the crown actually feared any uprising.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:11.720
[Guest]: They wanted their own safety and they wanted to be loved and respected.

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:16.480
[Guest]: So this law is very very literal in a sense that you couldn't say anything against them.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:22.360
[Guest]: When it started it was essentially to protect the church from criticism because we all know

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:28.160
[Guest]: that that history is tainted and even the state wanted to be protected from criticism

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:33.960
[Guest]: because I've also mentioned it in the book that in fact the queen at the time was stoned

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:39.800
[Guest]: by people when she was going to the tower and that's when they started prosecuting people

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.800
[Amit Varma]: for it.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:44.840
[Amit Varma]: And when Chitranshul says stoned by people, he does not mean she was given drugs or made

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.240
[Amit Varma]: to smoke weed.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.240
[Amit Varma]: She was literally stoned.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.240
[Amit Varma]: This is a family podcast.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:56.480
[Unknown]: I mean, I don't know what you're talking about.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:02.720
[Amit Varma]: So I mean, it's interesting because you know, you talk about the 13th century and about

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:08.160
[Amit Varma]: how we think today with the benefit of hindsight of England as this largely homogenous people.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.920
[Amit Varma]: But actually there were different people.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.000
[Amit Varma]: You had the Normans and the Saxons and the Celts and all of that sort of fighting for

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.760
[Amit Varma]: dominance and therefore for the centralizing authority that cropped up in the shape of

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:23.760
[Amit Varma]: the king and especially Edward the first who was like you point out of a legislative bent.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:29.000
[Amit Varma]: There was an importance to have laws which would keep these people in check.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.760
[Amit Varma]: And that is perhaps the birth of what you call clause 34 of the statute of Westminster.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:39.640
[Guest]: Yes, because what happened was that because of these, this heterogeneous population of

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.840
[Guest]: England, they did not even have uniformity of language like we, we don't realize this,

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.960
[Guest]: but they did not speak English back then.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.760
[Guest]: So they did not have uniformity of language or culture.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:55.240
[Guest]: So when these people got together, they literally formed an alliance because they were tired

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.240
[Guest]: of warring.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:00.120
[Guest]: They're tired of spending all the resources on fighting with each other.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:05.040
[Guest]: So say they decided that they should come together and live as a people as a nation.

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:10.680
[Guest]: But even then they were bound to be differences like, like in India, the different classes,

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.740
[Guest]: different communities, they're still friction.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:17.760
[Guest]: So that friction, which originated that union, union, which originated in war had a lot of

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:18.840
[Guest]: friction.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:25.640
[Guest]: So a Saxon king would not be loved or respected by the Celts and vice versa.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.960
[Guest]: So that is why I keep saying that this was a very, very literal law.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.600
[Guest]: You just couldn't say anything doesn't matter.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:37.200
[Guest]: If you say the king killed his wife, even if he had actually killed his wife, he, the

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.440
[Guest]: person who says the king killed his wife would be prosecuted for seditious libel.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.960
[Amit Varma]: It would not be a defense as indeed it wasn't at one stage of 124A.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:53.320
[Amit Varma]: I want to read out at last 24 of the statute of Westminster of 1275, just so that you can

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.880
[Amit Varma]: appreciate Macaulay who I earlier quoted a little bit more.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:02.520
[Amit Varma]: Quote, for as much as there have been often times found in the country, divisors of tales

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.400
[Amit Varma]: whereby the scourge or occasion of the scourge has many times arisen between the king and

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:11.280
[Amit Varma]: his people or great men of this realm for the damage that hath and may therefore ensue.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:17.120
[Amit Varma]: It is commanded that from henceforth none be so hardy to cite or publish any false news

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:21.200
[Amit Varma]: or tales whereby the scourge or slander may grow between the king and his people or the

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.200
[Amit Varma]: great men of his realm.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:29.040
[Amit Varma]: And he that doth so shall be taken and kept in prison until he hath brought him into the

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.680
[Amit Varma]: court, which was the first author of the tale.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.680
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.320
[Amit Varma]: And this is basically you can sum this law up in three words, right?

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.320
[Amit Varma]: No fake news.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.320
[Guest]: Yeah, no, not even fake news.

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.640
[Guest]: Don't say anything against the church or the state.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.640
[Guest]: Even if it's real, it doesn't matter.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.880
[Guest]: You can't call a priest a pedophile, even if he's a pedophile.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.120
[Guest]: It was as simple as that.

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:53.360
[Guest]: In fact, that sounds sounds a lot like Shakespeare and like Shakespeare, a lot of people, I'm

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.080
[Guest]: sure they don't understand it then as they don't understand it now.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.840
[Guest]: But at the end of the day, it was very simple.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.840
[Amit Varma]: Don't say anything against the establishment.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.920
[Amit Varma]: I'll correct you there.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.680
[Amit Varma]: And this has nothing to do with the subject of the show.

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.600
[Amit Varma]: But Shakespeare actually like I teach this course for Takshashila on how to write op-eds

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:11.880
[Amit Varma]: and one of the one of my little modules there is about how Shakespeare would write great

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:16.800
[Amit Varma]: public policy, because he most of his plays are written in iambic pentameter.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:22.120
[Amit Varma]: Iambic, of course, is the stress non stress alternative way of speaking kind of.

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:26.720
[Amit Varma]: But pentameter was that you basically have broadly speaking five units of two syllables

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:31.720
[Amit Varma]: each 10 syllables in a sentence, because that is how much we can speak without needing to

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.720
[Amit Varma]: pause.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.720
[Amit Varma]: Right?

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:38.560
[Amit Varma]: And his sentences were his language was written in such a way that actors would find it easy

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.600
[Amit Varma]: to say.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:43.040
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you will not find a single sentence in Shakespeare, which is as long

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.680
[Guest]: as the one I read out.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:50.480
[Guest]: So for your Twitter audience, this is a hashtag TIL moment for me to hear that Shakespeare

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.120
[Amit Varma]: actually was a beautifully elegant writer.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:48:00.160
[Amit Varma]: And let's let's get back to the subject at hand, which is so there is this law which

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.520
[Amit Varma]: aims to protect.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:06.640
[Amit Varma]: You've also pointed out the distinction between two kinds of laws, which is that there are

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.720
[Amit Varma]: laws which protect you from other citizens, which are meant to stop citizens harming other

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.720
[Amit Varma]: citizens.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.640
[Amit Varma]: And there are laws which are meant to protect the state.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:14.640
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.880
[Amit Varma]: And and this is sort of in the category of that.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.440
[Amit Varma]: But broadly apart from this, as English law evolves and common law happens, there is really

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.960
[Amit Varma]: no equivalent to the sedition law that's coming up.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.680
[Guest]: See, I'll just add to what I was saying first.

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:33.720
[Guest]: So the all these statutes which are created to act as a protection of the states from

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.720
[Guest]: its people is because there was a lot of chaos.

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:41.560
[Guest]: There was there was fear of overthrow every day.

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:47.400
[Guest]: And that's how this law, in fact, became a terrible tool, because tomorrow, a criticism

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:51.880
[Guest]: could be seen as an encouragement of to the masses to rise against the king.

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:56.000
[Guest]: What I meant was that that there was no law on sedition.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.440
[Guest]: Now, sedition is a broad category.

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:02.560
[Guest]: Sedition is just an umbrella term that's being used.

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:07.320
[Guest]: Sedition can be of various types, like it can be liable where you publish or speak against

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.320
[Guest]: us, speak seditious.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:13.280
[Amit Varma]: So these categories, these categories and seditious conspiracy was more about these

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:17.760
[Guest]: violent acts which would take place, seditious acts which would take place.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:24.020
[Guest]: So by saying there's no equivalent, yes, because Indian law uses the umbrella term.

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:30.840
[Guest]: But in fact, it was better to have these categories like instead of having a law against sedition,

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:35.960
[Guest]: a more ideal situation could have been a law against sedition, seditious libel, a separate

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:41.360
[Guest]: provision for seditious conspiracy, because today we club everything together.

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.960
[Guest]: And the punishment is the same for saying something or actually causing an uprising.

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.080
[Amit Varma]: So yes, that equivalence doesn't exist.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:51.440
[Amit Varma]: And you know, in one of the things that you keep talking about in your book and demonstrating

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:56.000
[Amit Varma]: in your book is that you can't just look at laws in isolation, you see them in the political

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.720
[Amit Varma]: context of the time, the social context of the time.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.280
[Amit Varma]: And so, you know, Macaulay between 33 and 37 works on this code, he gets it out, but

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:07.360
[Amit Varma]: then it's kind of stuck in the bureaucracy and is being debated back and forth.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:11.520
[Amit Varma]: And like you pointed out, Bethune does an alternative version of it and so on.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:16.680
[Amit Varma]: But then a strong impetus is given to it by circumstances, which is basically the revolt

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.680
[Amit Varma]: of 1857.

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.680
[Amit Varma]: Can you tell me a little bit about that?

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:23.040
[Amit Varma]: You know how the British crown then had to take command and then therefore needed a penal

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.880
[Guest]: code and hey, this was it.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:29.760
[Guest]: So yeah, so 1857, as you know, was the, they called it the first war of independence, but

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:34.920
[Guest]: it was more an organized mutiny across the country.

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:38.400
[Guest]: So and it again was on mostly on religious grounds.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.360
[Guest]: And I don't need to really go into that as such.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:46.760
[Guest]: So they had a makeshift law, when the mutiny happened, they got a makeshift law in where

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:51.160
[Guest]: they provided for an offense against the state that which is somewhat, I won't say similar

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:55.120
[Guest]: to sedition, but it was the first step towards having a law against sedition where you can't

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.720
[Guest]: criticize the government or say anything against the government and it had to be tried.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.600
[Guest]: And there was a summary trial with no appeal provided if you did something like that.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:08.040
[Guest]: So when the mutiny ended, and it's called the 1857 revolution, but at the end of the

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:14.040
[Guest]: day, it went on till 1858 and 1859, it finally ended in around 1859.

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:16.880
[Guest]: And that's when in 1860, the new law comes in.

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:21.040
[Guest]: But when the crown took over, they realized that they have to establish themselves and

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:24.240
[Guest]: they have to stop this from happening again.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:31.680
[Guest]: So that's when they tested the draft code and they handed it over to Barnes Peacock

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:38.660
[Guest]: to write it again and to make it a better law as such, define it a little more.

00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:47.660
[Guest]: So the penal code was an exercise in having a unified penal provision, unified penal provisions

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:54.040
[Guest]: in India to control the masses and to avoid another 1857 from happening.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:57.040
[Guest]: So that is how the crown wanted to assert itself.

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:03.120
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that there are two sort of simultaneous imperatives here, which is

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:08.620
[Amit Varma]: driving the British to sort of impose this penal code and one is of course, to protect

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.640
[Amit Varma]: themselves and to control the people.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:17.260
[Amit Varma]: But the other also is a transformative one to sort of to bring about social change, which

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:20.820
[Amit Varma]: is something you know, even Macaulay, for example, is notorious for having spoken about

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:24.260
[Amit Varma]: the civilizing impulse of empire and so on.

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:29.380
[Amit Varma]: So does the IPC sort of contain reflect both of these imperatives?

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:30.380
[Guest]: Yes, it does.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:38.980
[Guest]: In fact, I would be amiss to mention that Macaulay as such wasn't your ideal administrator.

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:43.980
[Guest]: His philosophies that have find origin racist thought.

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:48.660
[Guest]: He like you mentioned, he wanted to civilize the masses, the education system that he brought

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:52.400
[Guest]: about in the country that was also to civilize the masses.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.720
[Guest]: So there was a racist bone in his body.

00:52:55.720 --> 00:53:02.100
[Guest]: But so the law sort of even if you look at like the law of adultery, like women were

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.580
[Guest]: treated as shattered as property, thankfully, that laws gone now.

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:12.740
[Guest]: So only a man would be punished for adultery, not the woman who participated in that act.

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:17.060
[Amit Varma]: In fact, the man who slept with the wife of someone else would basically be prosecuted

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:21.500
[Guest]: for theft because he was taking yes, the property was the wife's was this is a Victorian law.

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:24.140
[Guest]: We did not have such a concept in India back then.

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:26.420
[Guest]: So he wanted that concept to be brought in.

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:29.740
[Guest]: He wanted that was a complete that was foreign to us.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:33.820
[Guest]: He wanted that to be brought in because then you elevate or rather denigrate a woman to

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:37.500
[Guest]: a status of property.

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:42.600
[Guest]: Similarly like social reform, if you say that they wanted to reform and in fact, the great

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:46.460
[Guest]: leaders of the day like Tilak also, they did not oppose it in principle.

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:50.620
[Guest]: He personally did not oppose it in principle, but he thought that it should be left to the

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:55.620
[Guest]: natives to the Hindus to do it themselves, do a reform, have awareness program like about

00:53:55.620 --> 00:54:00.540
[Guest]: the age of consent bill, where there's this tradition of which was the Garbhdan that on

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:03.940
[Guest]: the first night itself, the child bride would sleep with the man and it didn't matter he

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:05.460
[Guest]: was 30 or 40.

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.740
[Guest]: And there was a death which happened because of that.

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:10.780
[Guest]: Now, people did not react well to these changes.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:15.740
[Guest]: And these changes were brought, they tried to impose these changes through legislation,

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:19.020
[Guest]: which was alien for people back then.

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:23.060
[Guest]: So there was the like you said, they did try to civilize the masses if I may use their

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:24.700
[Guest]: language rather than our language.

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:26.820
[Guest]: They did want to civilize the masses through these laws.

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:31.220
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it's best used in inverted quotes, because the transformative effect that they

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:35.740
[Amit Varma]: wanted to have sort of seemed to me to fail in two ways.

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:40.580
[Amit Varma]: In one, of course, they are imposing Victorian values on India, which you could say are actually

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.420
[Amit Varma]: a step backwards from where we are.

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:49.260
[Amit Varma]: And two, even when they are trying to bring about positive social change, the point of

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:55.180
[Amit Varma]: Tilak, and this is a classic conservative criticism, which many others, I mean, Tilak,

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:59.860
[Amit Varma]: I don't think was a classic conservative, but the criticism itself is very Burkean is

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:04.420
[Amit Varma]: that you cannot change society in a top down way, you have to change it from within, you

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:07.420
[Guest]: have to change the culture and just having a law doesn't.

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.300
[Guest]: So in fact, it's very interesting.

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:15.580
[Guest]: So Tilak did not actually oppose this reform, but what he said was that you should make

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:22.660
[Guest]: people take a pledge that they will not force their girls into marriage at 10 or they will

00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:27.660
[Guest]: not force their girls to do garbhdan on the first night and none of his fellow reformers

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.180
[Guest]: nobody wanted to do that.

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:30.180
[Guest]: Nobody wanted to take that pledge.

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:34.220
[Guest]: He said, no, first you may create awareness, you make people do this voluntarily don't

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.820
[Guest]: impose it on them.

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:42.460
[Guest]: So Tilak while approaching this from a conservative place, he was not against reform, but he knew

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:46.060
[Guest]: the reality of the day that people will not accept this.

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:49.460
[Guest]: If let's say someone like Tilak would have initiated the idea, people would have been

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:51.060
[Guest]: more welcoming of it.

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.660
[Guest]: But because the idea did not come from Tilak, it came from the British.

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:59.260
[Guest]: So anyway, resentment had started that was the period when actual resentment against

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.080
[Guest]: the government had started.

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:05.980
[Guest]: It was where the, I would say the freedom movement had started taking form, not the

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.940
[Guest]: freedom movement, I said with anti British movement had started taking form.

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:11.540
[Guest]: So they thought there is a foreign influence.

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:12.980
[Guest]: Why should we listen to foreign influence?

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:15.860
[Guest]: Why should we listen to these people who not even from here?

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:18.240
[Guest]: Why should we listen to the white skin people?

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:22.780
[Guest]: So Tilak was right in a way that it has to come from within.

00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:27.580
[Guest]: But yes, people generally averse to these reforms.

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:29.320
[Guest]: Even Sati was opposed.

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:33.060
[Guest]: If you think about it today, I for the life of me can't imagine why it was opposed.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:35.340
[Guest]: Like I don't know why it was opposed.

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.700
[Guest]: Yes, customs, religion, everything.

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:44.000
[Guest]: But to kill someone just because their husband is dead, doesn't sound sound nice to me today.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.740
[Guest]: But at that time, it was opposed because it was the British who brought it.

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:54.700
[Guest]: So it was more and more resistance to foreign reforms than reforms themselves.

00:56:54.700 --> 00:57:00.500
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I had Jerry Rao on my show last week talking about Indian conservatism.

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:04.900
[Amit Varma]: And his point about conservatism, I think would be that conservatives aren't necessarily

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:08.340
[Amit Varma]: opposed to reform, but they are very concerned about the manner of reform that if you try

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:13.700
[Amit Varma]: to impose it in a top down way or try to do it radically, things can go wrong.

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:17.420
[Amit Varma]: Of course, my counter argument to that is that for something like Sati, you have to

00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:21.860
[Amit Varma]: be animated by first principles that taking someone's life is wrong, coercion is wrong.

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:26.260
[Amit Varma]: So you don't then wait for society to change once you have figured out that these are your

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.260
[Amit Varma]: values.

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:31.540
[Amit Varma]: So people could argue that not everyone shares those values.

00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:36.500
[Amit Varma]: Now, the interesting thing about the IPC when it's accepted, I think first Jan 1862 is when

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:41.140
[Amit Varma]: it comes into effect, is that at that point in time, that sedition law is not there.

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:47.020
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, it's whether it's an oversight or whatever, you know, it's it's slipped through

00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.020
[Guest]: the cracks, basically.

00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:49.380
[Unknown]: That's what they say.

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.700
[Guest]: We will never know why.

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:56.260
[Guest]: There's no literature on why it was not in the Indian Penal Code.

00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:02.460
[Guest]: There's no literature, they blame it on carelessness or they blame it on oversight, but we will

00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:05.780
[Guest]: maybe we'll never know why it was not brought in the first place.

00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:09.900
[Amit Varma]: But very soon there is, as you describe in your book, a movement to sort of bring the

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:10.900
[Amit Varma]: sedition law back.

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:14.500
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things driving it, which might be a TIL for many people listening to the

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:18.820
[Amit Varma]: show is a Wahhabi movement, the growing Wahhabi movement in India, which is, you know, and

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:23.100
[Amit Varma]: this is really before the organized freedom movement in India really takes birth.

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:27.900
[Amit Varma]: And the Wahhabi movement is the chief sort of circumstance, which makes the British think

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:32.740
[Amit Varma]: that, okay, we've got a bunch of laws after 1857 to keep the natives in check.

00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:34.420
[Amit Varma]: But we need more, we need the sedition law.

00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:35.420
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit.

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:41.660
[Guest]: So the Wahhabi, the Indian Wahhabism does not find its origin in Saudi Wahhabism.

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:47.500
[Guest]: Indian Wahhabism finds its origin in in Uttar Pradesh of all places, like Bareilly.

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:52.460
[Guest]: And so the Wahhabis at the time of the mutiny in 1857, they in fact did not participate

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.460
[Guest]: in it.

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:54.460
[Guest]: They were not nationalistic.

00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:55.460
[Guest]: They were communal.

00:58:55.460 --> 00:59:00.540
[Guest]: They did not want a India without the British.

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:02.760
[Guest]: They wanted an Islamic India.

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:05.140
[Guest]: So they sort of stayed away from the movement.

00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:09.260
[Guest]: So they actually did not play any role in it, maybe a minor role here and there, but

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:10.700
[Guest]: they did not play any role in it.

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:16.420
[Guest]: But after that ended and before it happened, they, earlier they fought, they were fighting

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:20.820
[Guest]: the Sikhs, then the Sikhs were defeated by the British and there's again, they refocused

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:22.180
[Guest]: on the British.

00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:27.220
[Guest]: They wanted to just drive away outsiders from the country and create a Islamic nation.

00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:32.220
[Guest]: So after 1857, there were a lot of conspiracies from across the country, from the Bengal presence,

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.980
[Guest]: from Dhaka to Punjab.

00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:38.700
[Guest]: And this was discovered over a period of time and there were major trials which happened

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:44.180
[Guest]: that happened in Ambala, in Patna, and Delhi, and Wahhabi leaders executed, but they just

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:46.180
[Guest]: refused to die down.

00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:53.140
[Guest]: So they actually felt that they need this against the Wahhabis because they could not

00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:57.500
[Guest]: deal with another uprising that close to the mutiny.

00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:02.500
[Guest]: So that is the most proximate cause for Section 124A being enacted.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:07.340
[Amit Varma]: So Section 124A comes back and it's also very interesting that you talk about two preventive

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:10.780
[Amit Varma]: laws to supplement Section 124A.

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:16.660
[Amit Varma]: The first you point out is a Dramatic Performances Act of 1876, which is, quote, intended to

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:23.780
[Amit Varma]: prevent performances of seditious, defamatory or scandalous nature, stop quote.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.460
[Amit Varma]: And of course, all of that is open to interpretation and anything can be and you point out very

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.820
[Amit Varma]: interestingly in the title of this play could be really modern.

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:34.560
[Amit Varma]: You talk about this play called Chai Ka Darpan, which was a proximate cause for the enactment

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:40.780
[Amit Varma]: of the law because Chai Ka Darpan was a play that portrayed owners, quote, portrayed owners

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:45.620
[Amit Varma]: of tea plantations and promoters of migration to tea growing districts as evil persons who

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:49.660
[Amit Varma]: exploited migrants both physically and sexually, stop quote.

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:54.260
[Amit Varma]: And as you point out in one of the witticisms that, pepper your book, if there is one rule

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:57.780
[Amit Varma]: you don't break, it's that you do not mess with the Englishman's tea.

01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:05.700
[Guest]: So these plantations which were across Assam, Bengal, they sort of fed England, the tea

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:07.280
[Guest]: went from here.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.140
[Guest]: But a lot of exploitation was happening on these plantations.

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.880
[Guest]: Migrant labor was being badly exploited.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:18.180
[Guest]: Number one, we were subjects and number two, they were even the financial overlords.

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:23.300
[Guest]: So it was rather a communist movement, if I may say so, that people got together and

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:28.100
[Guest]: they started writing and writing plays and performing plays where they criticize all

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.280
[Guest]: this.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.580
[Guest]: So the British government was spurred into action because one play, there were other

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:35.480
[Guest]: plays also and other poetry and stuff.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.900
[Amit Varma]: There is a play, Chai Ka Darpan exists?

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:43.520
[Guest]: So I couldn't locate it myself, but yeah, this play existed and they had to ban it.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.200
[Amit Varma]: So what I meant was, have you read it?

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.400
[Guest]: No, no, I couldn't find the text of the play.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:52.240
[Guest]: I had to glean it from the trials and from the history of the law and the speeches which

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.180
[Guest]: were delivered before that act was brought in.

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.560
[Guest]: So when that happened, that's when these laws came in to supplement the laws that, okay,

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.260
[Guest]: fine, we have a general law, but let's have these laws also separately.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:07.560
[Amit Varma]: And the other law, which I also found interesting, the other preventive law was the Vernacular

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:13.200
[Amit Varma]: Press Act of 1878, which was, quote, enacted to place newspapers published in local languages

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:17.240
[Amit Varma]: under the control of the government for repressing seditious writings, which are intended to

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.580
[Amit Varma]: produce disaffection towards the government in the mind of natives, stop quote.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:24.620
[Amit Varma]: And when I was reading this, it kind of struck me that we don't have that law today.

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:28.760
[Amit Varma]: But effectively, the same kind of pressures and incentives can still apply.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:34.880
[Amit Varma]: You still, for example, no FM radio station will ever dare to talk about politics or broadcast

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.120
[Amit Varma]: actual news because their license could be taken away.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:43.340
[Amit Varma]: Or for that matter, you know, different kinds of pressure can be put on all kinds of publications

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:49.220
[Amit Varma]: because a lot of publications depend on government advertising for their revenues.

01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:53.160
[Amit Varma]: So these pools and pressures still exist, except that there is really no need of a law

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.840
[Guest]: to sort of make it happen.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.920
[Guest]: It can be controlled economically rather than anything else.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:03.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, let's talk about the first sedition case now and which of 1891.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:09.400
[Amit Varma]: And before we talk about the first sedition case, and it's very interesting how what dovetails

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:15.460
[Amit Varma]: into this is one of their, you know, the British again trying to bring about social change

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:16.460
[Amit Varma]: in India.

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:22.240
[Amit Varma]: And there is obviously you point out that girls are being married as young as 10 years

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:26.440
[Amit Varma]: old and, you know, expected to conceive very soon.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:31.840
[Amit Varma]: And you talk about this child, right, called full money, who was 10 years old in 1889,

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:37.640
[Amit Varma]: married off to a man named Hari Mohan Mehti, who was over 30 years of age, and he has sex

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.120
[Amit Varma]: with her and she dies that night itself.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.860
[Amit Varma]: He's charged for her rape and murder.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:46.080
[Amit Varma]: And that leads to the coinage of the term Hari Mehtism, which I must confess, I haven't

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.400
[Amit Varma]: heard till I read your book, Hari Mehtism for the court practice of consummation of

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.160
[Amit Varma]: marriage with child rights, stop quote.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:58.920
[Amit Varma]: And he's acquitted because the law against rape does not apply to the marital rape of

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.240
[Amit Varma]: a girl of 10 years of age.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:06.640
[Amit Varma]: And at this point, the British government enacts the age of consent act of 18 March

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:11.340
[Amit Varma]: 1891, which raises the age of consent from 10 to 12.

01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.500
[Guest]: So that was a huge leap of two years.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.160
[Amit Varma]: And everybody goes nuts.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.360
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:23.720
[Guest]: So again, like I said, reforms for being resisted, and the Bengali intelligentsia, which is a

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:31.800
[Guest]: bongo bashi that took up issues with it and wrote severe editorials against this reform,

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.960
[Guest]: saying that the British come in and they're touching our Hindu cults terms and traditions,

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.600
[Guest]: they're destroying everything.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:42.120
[Guest]: And they say, if these if this keeps happening, we'll have to throw them out.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.120
[Guest]: I'm just, I'm paraphrasing everything.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:49.280
[Amit Varma]: I'll read that bit out where a translated extract of the first offending article which

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:53.840
[Amit Varma]: was cited in the case goes, quote, the English ruler is our Lord and Master and can interfere

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.880
[Amit Varma]: with our religion and usages by brute force and European civilization.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:02.740
[Amit Varma]: The Hindu is powerless to resist, but he is superior to your nation and good morals in

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:07.260
[Amit Varma]: gentle conduct and in good education, Hindu civilization and the Hindu religion are in

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:08.900
[Amit Varma]: danger of being destroyed.

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.800
[Amit Varma]: The Englishman stands revealed in his true colors.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:17.320
[Amit Varma]: He has a rifle and bayonet and slanders the Hindu from the might of the gun.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.080
[Amit Varma]: How are we to conciliate him?

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.080
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.880
[Amit Varma]: And when I read this, I thought, ki Englishman ke jaga mein elites dal do.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.880
[Unknown]: Exactly.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.880
[Unknown]: And it still applies.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:25.880
[Unknown]: This seems very, very familiar.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.880
[Unknown]: Doesn't it sound familiar?

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:31.160
[Unknown]: Yeah, you go on social media, doesn't it sound familiar today that this is exact same thing

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.080
[Unknown]: we are seeing again, the Hindu majority is victim.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.320
[Unknown]: Hindu khatre mein hai.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.800
[Amit Varma]: At that time, you could say, they were sort of the victim.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:43.240
[Amit Varma]: So anyway, so this guy comes up with this thing that how dare you raise the age to 12,

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.520
[Unknown]: you know, what are 11 year old girls to do?

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:51.120
[Guest]: And I know, but but but the age for marriage were not raised.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.340
[Guest]: Only the age for intercourse was raised.

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:56.220
[Guest]: So you could still have a 10 year old child bride.

01:05:56.220 --> 01:06:01.720
[Guest]: But if you have sex with her before she turned 12, that was marital rape, which seems very

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:06.200
[Amit Varma]: bizarrely legalistic, because there's no actual way of whoever is implementing the law to

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200
[Guest]: enforce it.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.200
[Guest]: Yes.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.880
[Amit Varma]: So they maybe they wanted to appear to be doing some good virtue signaling.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:12.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:17.760
[Guest]: It's very interesting today that even today, there's a debate on marital rape happening.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.520
[Guest]: That the petition spending in the Supreme Court and the High Court where they want marital

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.520
[Guest]: rape to be criminalized.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:26.720
[Guest]: So in fact, British did criminalize marital rape for 10 and 11 year old girl child.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.680
[Amit Varma]: So I guess what you could say is progress is basically the age of marital rape rising.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.680
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.920
[Amit Varma]: Jesus, I don't even know what to say.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:39.400
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk a bit about this sort of first case where the proprietor, editor, manager

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:44.680
[Amit Varma]: and printer of Bongo Bashi are all charged in a case known as Queen Empress versus Jogendra

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:48.920
[Amit Varma]: Chandra Bose and others.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.920
[Amit Varma]: And others.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.920
[Guest]: Okay, it's written.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:51.920
[Guest]: O.R.S is others.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.040
[Amit Varma]: What do I know about legal language?

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:58.040
[Amit Varma]: And one of the defenses, of course, is that hey, you know, we didn't kind of write it.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the writer is anonymous, and he's not here.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.800
[Amit Varma]: So don't blame us and that's kind of thrown out.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:08.880
[Amit Varma]: Now the debates around the sedition law, especially the terminology, especially the word disaffection,

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.720
[Guest]: kind of start from this case where Justice Petheram.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.720
[Guest]: Yeah, Justice Petheram.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:16.800
[Amit Varma]: When I read this, I couldn't figure out if he's an Englishman.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.560
[Unknown]: Englishman, definitely Englishman.

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:22.240
[Amit Varma]: So not Petheram, but Justice Petheram.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.320
[Amit Varma]: And so tell me a bit about the debate around this case and kind of what happens.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:32.520
[Guest]: So what they did was that they wanted to interpret what disaffection actually means.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:38.960
[Guest]: So what he said, it doesn't know what the presence of the letters DIS between affection

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.640
[Guest]: means it has to be the opposite of affection.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.160
[Guest]: So the opposite of affection is hatred.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.880
[Guest]: So it doesn't matter if it's a legitimate criticism.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:54.680
[Guest]: If they if they if they if he asked the jury to decide whether they felt that was this

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:58.480
[Guest]: intended to create hatred against the government or not.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:02.800
[Guest]: Doesn't matter no violence ensued, doesn't matter that it was a legitimate criticism.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:06.160
[Guest]: I say legitimate because of what people felt that back then.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:12.720
[Guest]: So he made a very, very literal interpretation of the term disaffection and said that hatred,

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:17.520
[Amit Varma]: anything to incite hatred against the government would lead to the offense of sedition.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:22.760
[Amit Varma]: And the sort of counter interpretation of this is that, you know, you don't that the

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:26.160
[Amit Varma]: word disaffection in a legal sense has evolved to mean something else.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:30.800
[Amit Varma]: And the way the sedition law has also been interpreted is that merely criticizing the

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.800
[Amit Varma]: government or inspiring hatred against it isn't enough.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:38.680
[Amit Varma]: You also need to incite people to specific acts of violence against it only then is it

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.680
[Guest]: sedition.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.800
[Guest]: So that that actually happened later that happened in the 1960s.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:47.400
[Guest]: Prior to that, there was no such interpretation built into the law.

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:50.720
[Guest]: It is actually the Supreme Court which read down the law to include this, that actual

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.920
[Guest]: incitement of hatred has to happen.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:58.240
[Guest]: But before that, mere criticism which which would cause disloyalty or hatred against the

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.880
[Guest]: government was enough to be punished for sedition.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.560
[Amit Varma]: But this is Peter M's interpretation of disaffection that there were other interpretations which

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.560
[Guest]: came up.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.480
[Guest]: The interpretation was Morris Goyer which happened a lot later in the 1940s.

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:15.000
[Guest]: And he sort of said what Kedarnath judgment said eventually, that unless there's incitement

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.840
[Guest]: to violence, you can't punish a person for sedition.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.320
[Guest]: But it was quickly set aside with the Privy Council in another case.

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, we'll come to that.

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on to the Tilak case.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, Tilak was, you know, a member of the governor's legislative council.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.840
[Amit Varma]: And he was a fairly big guy within local circles at the time.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.080
[Amit Varma]: And he had this newspaper called Kesri.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:40.380
[Amit Varma]: And the first case against him really comes because he seems to justify violence, especially

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:47.400
[Amit Varma]: in the context of Shivaji, where, you know, he essentially argues that Shivaji was justified

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:51.240
[Amit Varma]: in killing Afzal Khan in the way that he did that it was an act of self defense.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:57.960
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, to use that as an analogy against the empire, that there are modern circumstances,

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.320
[Amit Varma]: contemporary circumstances, in which case such violence may be justified.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.440
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, he was hold up for sedition.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.080
[Amit Varma]: What are the sort of arguments going back and forth?

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:11.480
[Guest]: So what had actually happened was that there was a plague in Pune, prior to all that.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.920
[Guest]: And a lot of people died and they were really resisting the government's effort to rescue

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.040
[Guest]: victims or to quarantine people.

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.360
[Guest]: So there was this plague commissioner Rand.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.320
[Guest]: And so people really detested him.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:32.040
[Guest]: In fact, Tilak himself had a huge hand to play in getting people to accept government

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.920
[Guest]: help getting them into hospitals, leave their homes because they were very afraid of British

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.920
[Amit Varma]: help.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.160
[Amit Varma]: And what these Britishers were basically doing is they were coming home and if they found

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.120
[Amit Varma]: a victim, just send them off to the hospital.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.360
[Guest]: And burn all their possessions.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:48.640
[Amit Varma]: So you're having people whose homes are being invaded, their relatives being sent away to

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.560
[Amit Varma]: a hospital, and their things being burnt.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.720
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes if there's no one else at home, the houses just left like that.

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.720
[Guest]: Yes.

01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:00.720
[Guest]: So basically, that's why the natives of Pune, they felt that this was an act of aggression

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.280
[Guest]: against the local population.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:04.320
[Guest]: In fact, they were trying to help them.

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:10.960
[Guest]: And soon after that, the Shivaji festival was, I would say it was reborn in the years

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.320
[Guest]: around that time.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:18.360
[Guest]: And when he delivered the speech, sometime after that, days after that, Rand was assassinated

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.440
[Guest]: because of this plague relief work.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:28.120
[Guest]: Now the British then need an excuse to catch the luck for something.

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.700
[Guest]: Even though he was a member of the legislative council, and he was a very important man,

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.360
[Guest]: but they still detested him.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.400
[Guest]: He was seen as a power center, separate power centers.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.640
[Guest]: Again, it was very political.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:43.440
[Guest]: And the newspapers, the Anglo-Indian newspapers like the Times of India, and the English language

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.920
[Guest]: newspapers were really against these vernacular papers or Indians running English papers like

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:51.960
[Guest]: the Maratha was actually an English paper and Kesari was the vernacular paper, Marathi

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.960
[Guest]: paper.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.440
[Guest]: So when this was reported, when these speeches which he delivered and other people delivered

01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:02.800
[Guest]: in those, in Raikad, they tried to join it.

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.920
[Guest]: They have tried to create a proximity with assassination.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:11.160
[Guest]: And when they raided him, they found literature, which he still, he claimed that it was not

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.160
[Guest]: his.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:18.000
[Guest]: So they found literature about subversive activities.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.600
[Guest]: So they actually arrested him at that point of time to send a message to the vernacular

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.800
[Guest]: press and to the people around at that point of time.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.320
[Guest]: And his defense was that this is not sedition.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.040
[Guest]: His defense was there's nothing in his speeches where he tries to incite hatred against the

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.580
[Guest]: government.

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:38.500
[Guest]: So he actually tried to raise a defense within the law.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.500
[Guest]: He tried to defend himself.

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:40.500
[Guest]: He did not have legal help.

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.440
[Guest]: He did everything himself.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:47.920
[Guest]: So his defense was that he did not say or utter anything which could incite hatred against

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.920
[Guest]: the government.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.200
[Guest]: In fact, looked at my other work that I've done.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.120
[Guest]: I'm actually supporting the government and the government's efforts.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.480
[Amit Varma]: That was his defense.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:59.400
[Amit Varma]: And at one point he had when he couldn't find anyone to defend him, Rabindranath Tagore

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:03.280
[Amit Varma]: got him these two notes from Calcutta.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.160
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of those lawyers say something really interesting in his defense of Tilak,

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:11.840
[Amit Varma]: which, you know, leads me to my sort of next question, which is a regression, which is

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:16.400
[Amit Varma]: quote, if the government seriously believed Tilak guilty of the abetment of murder, it

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.840
[Amit Varma]: ought to have openly accused him of it.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:24.080
[Amit Varma]: The very fact that he has not been so charged, but prosecuted under 124A, shows the weakness

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:29.220
[Amit Varma]: of the government's case, stop quote, at which point it makes me wonder that if the issue

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:33.720
[Amit Varma]: of sedition is the violence and the damage to property and all of those things, you already

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.560
[Amit Varma]: have laws against all of those things.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:36.560
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.840
[Guest]: Why would you then need a sedition law at all?

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.200
[Guest]: It's a political tool.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:43.520
[Guest]: It's not a law to punish a person for, for an act as such.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:48.900
[Guest]: It is a law to punish a person for his thought, for his ideology.

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:51.360
[Guest]: So that was what happened with Tilak as well.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.640
[Amit Varma]: And to what extent since it's a political tool, as you say, to what extent is it used

01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:02.440
[Amit Varma]: as a chilling effect, whereby, you know, prosecuting Tilak under the sedition law, the proximate

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.120
[Amit Varma]: purpose is that okay, he has done something you disapprove of and you want to punish him

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.120
[Amit Varma]: for it.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:11.000
[Amit Varma]: But the larger purpose is that everyone else shuts up because they don't want it to happen

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
[Guest]: to them.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.480
[Guest]: Because at the same time, there was some other trials also, which had a larger effect of

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.960
[Guest]: the vernacular press being suppressed.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.840
[Amit Varma]: So that was a larger issue.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:23.000
[Amit Varma]: So you know, one of the things that you know, as we've seen earlier in the narrative, that

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.360
[Amit Varma]: McCauley's code was basically languishing until 1857 creates a political imperative

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.560
[Amit Varma]: and something has to be done.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.800
[Amit Varma]: And it comes into being.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:37.320
[Amit Varma]: And here again, I think a lot of us forget the environment of the early 1900s, early

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:42.840
[Amit Varma]: 20th century, when, you know, contrary to the peaceful Satyagraha based movements, which

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:47.240
[Amit Varma]: would, which we now remember from the 20s and 30s and 40s, there was actually a lot

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:50.480
[Amit Varma]: of violence in the early years of the 20th century, which worried the British.

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.480
[Unknown]: A lot of revolutionary crime.

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:52.480
[Unknown]: Yes.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.560
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that and how that shaped the government's approach to, you know,

01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:01.760
[Amit Varma]: the sedition law itself and other laws like prevention of seditious meetings act in 19th

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:02.760
[Amit Varma]: century.

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:03.760
[Guest]: In 1907, that you talk about.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:09.600
[Guest]: So this phenomenon, which I talk about revolutionary crime, it was it originated in Bengal, subsequent

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.600
[Guest]: to the partition of Bengal.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.240
[Guest]: There was a lot of resentment against the partition.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:16.040
[Guest]: They thought they were driving a population against each other.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.720
[Guest]: In fact, the Nawab of Dhaka initially was against the idea, but subsequently got around

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.920
[Guest]: to it because the British promised him power over that region.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:27.240
[Guest]: So it's a, it originated there, but the influence was largely Russian.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:34.480
[Guest]: There was a Russian revolution where they discovered the power of a bomb and that spread

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:37.160
[Guest]: to India, to Bengal and to Punjab.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.200
[Guest]: And they started creating this age of the bomb.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:45.400
[Guest]: They started throwing bombs, crudely made bombs, but they were trying to get hurt.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:50.360
[Guest]: Then secret societies formed all over Bengal and what is East Bengal and West Bengal, all

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.760
[Guest]: over East and West Bengal, which were called Anusilan Samitis.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.640
[Guest]: What these Samitis would do is they would train youngsters as people, children as young

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:04.920
[Guest]: as 15, 16, 18 to just do violent acts, violent acts of revolution against the government,

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.960
[Guest]: send a message across to the government that we are not going to sit silent.

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.320
[Guest]: So this age as such was a very, very violent age.

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.560
[Guest]: It was more than anything political.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.900
[Guest]: It was resentment.

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:18.120
[Guest]: It was actually hated against the government because of the partition.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:23.800
[Guest]: And they just discovered these bomb making techniques and literature, which came from

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:24.800
[Amit Varma]: Russia.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.800
[Amit Varma]: So it really helped them.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.200
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting that, you know, if one looks at the freedom movement, there's obviously

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.840
[Amit Varma]: the division between the moderates and the extremists and the moderates like, you know,

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:35.800
[Amit Varma]: Gokhale Ranade Agarkar and so on, believe in the power of petitioning and they want

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.000
[Unknown]: to sort of work with the power of cooperation and all that.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:46.120
[Amit Varma]: And the so called extremists like, you know, Tilak and Annie Besant and Banerjee are figuring

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.400
[Amit Varma]: out that that has its limits.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:54.600
[Amit Varma]: So B. R. Nanda in a great biography of Gokhale once said something to the effect of the moderates

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:58.600
[Amit Varma]: are extreme in their moderation and the extremists are moderate in their extremism.

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.160
[Amit Varma]: So they weren't all that far apart.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:05.440
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is, this seems to me about that point in time where people are realizing the

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:09.000
[Amit Varma]: futility of trying to negotiate with the colonial government.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.120
[Amit Varma]: Though Gandhi is trying that in South Africa, and he comes back and he continues trying

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:18.000
[Amit Varma]: that till, you know, the second half of the second decade.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.720
[Amit Varma]: But and now all these violent impulses are beginning to play out.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.160
[Amit Varma]: There's Aurobindo Ghosh and his brother.

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.480
[Amit Varma]: There's what is happening in London.

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there are two recent biographies on Savarkar which talk about India house and

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.480
[Amit Varma]: the stuff that is happening there.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.880
[Amit Varma]: In fact, his brother Ganesh Savarkar was, as you point out in your book, convicted for

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.880
[Guest]: writing poems.

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:36.880
[Guest]: Yes.

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:37.880
[Guest]: This was in Nashik.

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:43.680
[Amit Varma]: He was convicted for writing poems which are considered subversive and seditious.

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:46.600
[Amit Varma]: And Savarkar is, Vinayak Savarkar is very pissed off at this.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:50.440
[Amit Varma]: He's in London at the time and he gets in, allegedly gets an associate of his mother-in-law

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:53.480
[Amit Varma]: Dhingra to go and assassinate a British guy.

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.400
[Amit Varma]: And assassinate the wrong guy.

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.640
[Amit Varma]: Assassinates the wrong guy and that sets off a chain of events which leads to Savarkar

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:04.800
[Amit Varma]: being sent to Kalapani for 10 years where he is completely radicalized and then he comes

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.080
[Amit Varma]: out and writes Hindutva.

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:08.640
[Amit Varma]: So what would have happened if he wasn't arrested?

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.640
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:13.120
[Amit Varma]: Is this so much sort of, I mean, the counterfactuals are so incredibly fascinating.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.120
[Amit Varma]: You should one day write a book of fiction about it.

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:18.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.360
[Amit Varma]: Wink.

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.360
[Amit Varma]: Wink.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.760
[Amit Varma]: So, so all of this is happening.

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:28.740
[Amit Varma]: And at this point, sort of, you know, there are other laws coming up, like there's a prevention

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:32.200
[Amit Varma]: of seditious meeting acts coming up.

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:37.240
[Amit Varma]: And Tilak himself is convicted again in a second trial because he praises the making

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:38.240
[Amit Varma]: of bombs.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.240
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.280
[Amit Varma]: And the raiders home and they apparently find bomb making manuals.

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:42.280
[Guest]: Is that true?

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.280
[Guest]: He really had bomb making manuals.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.080
[Guest]: So, it was not really bomb making manuals.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:50.680
[Guest]: It didn't teach people how to make bombs, but it related to bombs.

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:54.760
[Guest]: Like it mentions certain kinds of explosives and stuff like that.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:58.080
[Guest]: And when his house was raided, he was not even there.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.080
[Guest]: He was in Bombay.

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.080
[Amit Varma]: So it could have been planted.

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.080
[Unknown]: It could have been anything.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:02.080
[Guest]: We will never know.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.080
[Guest]: It was not his.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.000
[Guest]: And he says, even if I have it, how does it matter?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.760
[Guest]: I have not acted upon it.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.600
[Guest]: Have you known me to make bombs?

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.600
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.400
[Guest]: So that was that was completely orchestrated again.

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:16.840
[Guest]: He was, they waited for him to turn up in Bombay before they could arrest him.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:17.840
[Guest]: They don't want him tried in Pune.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:20.240
[Guest]: They wanted to try and get him tried in Bombay.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:23.840
[Guest]: In fact, he turned up there because a buddy of his was to help a buddy of his with a seditious

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:24.840
[Guest]: case of his own.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:25.840
[Guest]: Kaal.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:26.840
[Guest]: That was the Kaal trial.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:30.920
[Guest]: Paranjpe was being tried for sedition and he had turned up to create his defense.

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:35.880
[Guest]: In fact, very interesting that Damodar Savarkar also was in Bombay at the same time.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.560
[Guest]: And when they were agitating against, he was arrested outside the police station then and

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:44.040
[Guest]: he was arrested and convicted for not for sedition or something else.

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.480
[Guest]: And he gets out and then goes back.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.480
[Guest]: So it's again a very interesting core connected story.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.500
[Guest]: All these are connected with each other.

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:54.200
[Guest]: So yes, it was again a political exercise.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:59.560
[Guest]: And again, what he did was that he again defended himself within the confines of the law.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.360
[Guest]: He again had to foot his own legal defense.

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:03.760
[Guest]: He had to do everything himself.

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:10.280
[Guest]: He stood up and spoke in court for more than 24 hours, like combined total of 24, 27 hours.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.280
[Amit Varma]: Practically a filibuster speech.

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.280
[Guest]: Yes, a filibuster speech.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:17.920
[Amit Varma]: His speech started on 15 July and concluded on 22nd July.

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.760
[Guest]: Yes, with a weekend break.

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:20.760
[Unknown]: With a weekend break.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:23.680
[Guest]: Where the jury had to go and check their mail.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.320
[Guest]: So that was that speech.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:29.640
[Amit Varma]: And unfortunately, some of the speech, but thankfully not all of it.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:30.640
[Amit Varma]: The speech is a book in itself.

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:34.440
[Amit Varma]: I'll quote a bit from it because I kind of underlined it.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:39.140
[Amit Varma]: And I know you don't like people desecrating books, but I underline furiously.

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:42.200
[Amit Varma]: This is a Tilak speaking as part of his 21 hour speech.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:47.200
[Amit Varma]: Quote, if the writer's motives are good, he if he is trying to secure constitutional rights

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:52.220
[Amit Varma]: for the people trying in a fair way and persevering manner, he is entitled to express his views

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:53.760
[Amit Varma]: fully and fearlessly.

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:58.360
[Amit Varma]: The mere fact that the views of the writer are not correct or are even absurd or that

01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:02.320
[Amit Varma]: he expressed them in violent language would not make him seditious.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.320
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:07.320
[Amit Varma]: And I wish a lot of the nationalists of today who sort of seem to revere Tilak would, you

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:12.280
[Guest]: know, pay a little more attention to his support for free speech.

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.200
[Guest]: So yeah, but that didn't help him.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:19.120
[Guest]: The jury was almost all, not almost, it was all white Europeans and Englishmen.

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.120
[Guest]: So whatever he would have done, it was premeditated.

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.480
[Guest]: And in fact, it's very interesting that the judge who tried him was his lawyer when he

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.480
[Guest]: was first convicted.

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.480
[Guest]: Dawar.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.480
[Guest]: Dawar, this is Dawar.

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:36.240
[Guest]: This is Dawar was his lawyer when he got bail for Tilak in the first sedition trial.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:41.520
[Guest]: And Dawar's son was Tilak's lawyer during his second sedition trial.

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:44.080
[Amit Varma]: Another man who was involved was Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.080
[Amit Varma]: Jinnah was his actual lawyer.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.840
[Guest]: Was his actual lawyer.

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:54.360
[Guest]: So and but eventually Tilak had to again argue himself, but so it was all premeditated.

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:58.520
[Guest]: It was very interesting because Dawar, what he argued to secure bail for Tilak in the

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:03.920
[Guest]: first trial decided exact opposite in the second trial.

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:09.800
[Guest]: So it was, you could see the kind of bias or rather the kind of anger against Tilak

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.880
[Guest]: which existed in that day.

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.040
[Guest]: He had become an all powerful figure.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:18.800
[Guest]: He was in fact bigger than Gandhi at that point of time or rather Gandhi came later.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.920
[Unknown]: Gandhi was well known in India.

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:28.320
[Guest]: He was a giant in South Africa, but Tilak was the giant of the day in 1916.

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.400
[Guest]: So yes, it was again completely political.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.000
[Guest]: I keep repeating myself.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.400
[Amit Varma]: And I'm kind of struck by, you know, you quote Dawar's words after Tilak is convicted and

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.640
[Amit Varma]: I'm struck by how vituperative they are.

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:43.080
[Amit Varma]: Where Dawar says of Tilak, quote, it seems to me that it must be a diseased mind, a most

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:46.960
[Amit Varma]: perverted intellect that could say that the articles which you have written are legitimate

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.520
[Amit Varma]: weapons in political agitation.

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:53.200
[Amit Varma]: They are seething with sedition, they preach violence, they speak of murders with approval

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:57.840
[Amit Varma]: and the cowardly and atrocious act of committing murders with bombs not only seems to meet

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.480
[Amit Varma]: with your approval, but you hail the advent of the bomb in India as if something has come

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:04.520
[Amit Varma]: to India for his good.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.520
[Guest]: Stop quote.

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.520
[Guest]: And that's what I said.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:10.520
[Guest]: The anger against Tilak was, everyone's minds were prejudiced.

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:13.960
[Guest]: You couldn't even if you were spoken to 42 hours at a stretch, you still would have been

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:14.960
[Guest]: convicted.

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:15.960
[Amit Varma]: It was a 4-1 conclusion.

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:20.520
[Amit Varma]: And it's it's in sort of an interesting question that kind of strikes me and I think about

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.360
[Amit Varma]: this in other contexts as well.

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:27.640
[Amit Varma]: That if we are to look back today with the values of today, we would say that, you know,

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:32.020
[Amit Varma]: the British having a sedition law to prevent people rising up against them is understandable

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:33.920
[Amit Varma]: and rational from their point of view.

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:38.720
[Amit Varma]: At the same time, looking back today, we can say that we are completely on Tilak's side

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:42.200
[Amit Varma]: and the side of all of these people who were fighting the empire, though that qualifies

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:45.600
[Amit Varma]: as sedition and therefore unlawful at that time.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:50.520
[Amit Varma]: But the other aspect of it also, and you know, where Gandhi diverged from the likes of Tilak

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.840
[Amit Varma]: was when it comes to the means.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:58.760
[Amit Varma]: Yes, that a lot of these, you know, the Aurobindo Ghosh, Savarkar, to some extent, Tilak in

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:03.880
[Amit Varma]: his tacit support for violent means seem to say that our end is noble, we want to get

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.920
[Amit Varma]: rid of the empire and therefore any means are justified.

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.440
[Amit Varma]: And to me, even sitting here with this passage of time, it would seem to me that that is

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.880
[Amit Varma]: wrong, that the end doesn't justify the means and that a lot of the moral judgment, if you

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:21.280
[Amit Varma]: are to pass any on those people has to do with the means also and not the end.

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:27.720
[Amit Varma]: So the, you know, I'm just thinking that one can't just look at sedition in the classic

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.600
[Amit Varma]: one sided way that of course it is a tool of political oppression.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:36.280
[Amit Varma]: But also a you see why it is necessary and be some of the people that the act was being

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.880
[Amit Varma]: used against for basically killing people, they were assassins.

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:40.240
[Guest]: So let's look at it this way.

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.000
[Guest]: I won't, I'm not saying that one supports murder here or one supports assassinations

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
[Guest]: here.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.760
[Guest]: But you have to look at a way, look at the context of that day, that the government they

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:53.000
[Guest]: were under, the subjects of whom they were subjects, was not a government of their choice.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.280
[Guest]: It was imposed on them.

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:57.440
[Guest]: The laws were imposed on them, the language was imposed on them, the culture was imposed

01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.440
[Guest]: on them.

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:01.960
[Guest]: They completely came and changed Indian society.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:07.200
[Guest]: And they looted from India, the famines which happened, they exported grains didn't leave

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:09.080
[Guest]: anything for the natives.

01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:14.520
[Guest]: So when you look at the anger, what they felt, we will not be able to understand it today.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:19.720
[Guest]: So even to try to contextualize it today, I don't know, I don't think we can do that.

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:23.320
[Amit Varma]: I don't think we are too used to being corseted in a nice democracy.

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.960
[Guest]: And yes, we used to living under rule of law, we are used to checks and balances, it may

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.680
[Guest]: be getting wiped away.

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:34.040
[Guest]: But today, we are used to that, at that point of time, the rule of law only existed for

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.040
[Amit Varma]: the British.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.800
[Amit Varma]: Would you say that that situation is analogous to what Kashmir and Kashmiris are going through

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:40.800
[Unknown]: today?

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:44.080
[Amit Varma]: Or is it seditious even to bring that thought up?

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.440
[Guest]: That's a very controversial topic.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:51.520
[Amit Varma]: But because if we were to say that we would in a sense, we could be accused of sedition.

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:56.080
[Guest]: But at the same time, yeah, they can try for sure.

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:59.720
[Guest]: No, but at the end of the day, until unless someone asks someone to pick up arms against

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.400
[Guest]: the government, that's not seditious.

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:06.440
[Guest]: This is a simple, whenever someone asks me that, oh, is this seditious or not?

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:09.960
[Guest]: So if someone says, Oh, Amit Verma said this about Kashmir, oh my god, he should be prosecuted

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:10.960
[Guest]: for sedition.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:11.960
[Guest]: I said, did he cause violence?

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:12.960
[Guest]: Did he bring the state down?

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.240
[Guest]: Or did he try to bring the state down?

01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.360
[Amit Varma]: If you did not, it is not seditious.

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.360
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:21.480
[Amit Varma]: I hope everyone pays heed to these words of yours.

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:28.160
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on now to sort of the 1970 1918 period where there is on the one hand, you

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:32.240
[Amit Varma]: have the Montague Jamesford reforms, which are being driven by the British Parliament

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:36.280
[Amit Varma]: and are largely progressive and good for us and respectful of us.

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:41.160
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, you also have the Rowlett Commission or the Sedition Commission, the

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:47.200
[Amit Varma]: Sedition Committee, as it is, which is meeting and deciding how to keep the natives in check.

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:48.720
[Amit Varma]: And what we have isn't adequate.

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:49.920
[Amit Varma]: What more do we need to do?

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:55.160
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about you know, what the committee comes up with and the reactions of the Rowlett

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.160
[Guest]: Act.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.560
[Guest]: So the committee basically goes through one and a half decades of revolutionary crime,

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:04.720
[Guest]: it chronicles everything and goes to the causes of the crime.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.720
[Guest]: And then it was supposed to make its recommendation on whether the law should be reformed.

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:12.480
[Guest]: When I say reform, it should be made stricter to prevent this because you have to understand

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:17.160
[Guest]: that it also coincided with the First World War in Punjab and in the rest of India, the

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.720
[Guest]: Defense of India Act was in play.

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:23.960
[Guest]: So they could not have afforded revolution on one hand war on the other.

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.780
[Guest]: So they wanted to prevent this in future.

01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:30.440
[Guest]: So what the Rowlett Committee did, it wanted to make the law stricter.

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.160
[Guest]: It wanted to make the law stricter.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.960
[Guest]: But ironically, it also built a safety valve in that law.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.720
[Guest]: It said that this law can only be imposed what they call the Rowlett Act and or the

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:44.080
[Guest]: Black Act as the Indians called it.

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:50.760
[Guest]: They wanted it to be imposed only upon a declaration of emergency, a declaration of necessity for

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.360
[Guest]: imposition of such law.

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:57.920
[Guest]: So that could only be done in cases of uprising and absolute uprising, which was largely not

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.120
[Guest]: accepted by the people.

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.800
[Guest]: In fact, that law was a paper tiger.

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:04.200
[Guest]: It died a natural death.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:06.120
[Guest]: It never came into effect.

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:10.920
[Guest]: But if you look at the law today, even though we are not under the British government, there

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:13.840
[Guest]: is no safety valve built into the law.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:18.400
[Guest]: It was left to the Supreme Court to finally interpret it.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.000
[Guest]: And even that interpretation is not being followed today.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.040
[Guest]: Nobody even the law enforcement officers don't know what this law is actually about.

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:27.040
[Guest]: And there's no safety valve.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.600
[Guest]: Even the UAPA does not have any safety valve.

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.720
[Guest]: You can apply this, the police can arrest anyone at any point of time.

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:36.880
[Guest]: There's no necessity of the situation, let's say in a Chhattisgarh that there's a mass

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.120
[Guest]: uprising, an excited movement all across the state.

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.600
[Guest]: And that's when you impose 124A.

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:42.760
[Guest]: It's not the case.

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:47.560
[Guest]: Even in peaceful, you're reading a book in Darjeeling and you say, oh, this shouldn't

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:52.200
[Guest]: happen and we should have a change of government and there's that and some nice nationalistic

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.200
[Guest]: fellow will come across and say, oh, you're being seditious.

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:57.680
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, people have been arrested for Facebook posts.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:01.400
[Guest]: They've been arrested for receiving messages on a WhatsApp group, or rather just receiving

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:04.240
[Guest]: random messages, which they had no nothing to do with.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.920
[Guest]: So anything, anyone can be just arrested for it.

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:12.080
[Guest]: So it's not the trial, because I mentioned that they say that there's this, there have

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:16.920
[Guest]: been two convictions in the last four from 2014, 2016, but there I could not find a single

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:17.920
[Guest]: conviction.

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:18.920
[Guest]: I did not find a single judgment.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.760
[Guest]: So it's not about trial or whatever.

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:24.080
[Guest]: It's about what happens before that, that arrest and persecution, which happens.

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.080
[Amit Varma]: It's a chilling effect.

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.080
[Amit Varma]: It's a chilling effect.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:30.280
[Guest]: Like today, we have to keep giving disclaimers that we're not seditious, right?

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:31.400
[Guest]: So that is what happens.

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:34.880
[Guest]: Otherwise, you won't have this fear of speaking to the public about this.

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:38.400
[Amit Varma]: Someone did once threatened to file a sedition case against me, by the way, in the column

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.400
[Unknown]: about it as well.

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.400
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.400
[Amit Varma]: Oh, wonderful.

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.960
[Amit Varma]: I was in the column against 295A and 153A.

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:46.760
[Amit Varma]: And somebody said, No, no, you're spreading this affection against the government.

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:47.760
[Guest]: I'll file a case on 124A.

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:48.760
[Guest]: Oh, they should have done.

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:49.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, we should have had a why?

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.400
[Amit Varma]: We should have gone up to the Supreme Court to get the law settled again.

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:55.240
[Amit Varma]: And you won't even defend me because you do bankruptcy law.

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.280
[Amit Varma]: Speaking is very easy, boss.

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.880
[Unknown]: I hope that bankruptcy law is treating you well.

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure you would have paid me well.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
[Amit Varma]: I don't have any money, bro.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm bankrupt.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Actually, you know, maybe then you would have come good for me.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:13.920
[Amit Varma]: I want to move on now to a chapter of yours called Gandhi, Azad and Nehru, politics of

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.000
[Amit Varma]: sedition.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.760
[Amit Varma]: And you begin this with a quote by Gandhi, which is in his sedition trial in 1922, which

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:22.120
[Amit Varma]: I found profoundly impressive.

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:26.360
[Amit Varma]: So I want to quote the full thing, which is, quote, I would like to state that I entirely

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:30.400
[Amit Varma]: endorse the learned advocate general's remarks in connection with my humble self.

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:33.800
[Amit Varma]: I think that he was entirely fair to me in all statements that he has made, because it

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:34.900
[Amit Varma]: is very true.

01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.600
[Amit Varma]: And I have no desire whatsoever to conceal from this court.

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:42.600
[Amit Varma]: The fact that to preach this affection towards the existing system of government has become

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:44.400
[Amit Varma]: almost a passion with me.

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:48.440
[Amit Varma]: And the advocate general is also entirely in the right when he says that my preaching

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:51.620
[Amit Varma]: of this affection does not commence with my connection to young India.

01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:53.760
[Amit Varma]: This is a magazine Iran.

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:55.760
[Amit Varma]: But that it can commence much earlier.

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:58.240
[Amit Varma]: I do not pled any extenuating act.

01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:02.000
[Amit Varma]: I am here, therefore, to invite and submit to the highest penalty that can be inflicted

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:07.680
[Amit Varma]: upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me the highest duty of

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.400
[Amit Varma]: the citizen, stop quote.

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:15.360
[Amit Varma]: And your chapter, of course, talks about different trials in which Gandhi, Maulana Abul Kalam

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:19.160
[Amit Varma]: Azad and Jawaharlal Nehru all pleaded guilty of sedition.

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:25.560
[Amit Varma]: And when I read, you know, and this sort of this was, you know, all of the courts that

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:29.040
[Amit Varma]: you've reproduced in this chapter were very clarifying for me, because the thought that

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:33.400
[Amit Varma]: struck me with your earlier chapter when Tilak and all these guys were under trial, is that

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.280
[Amit Varma]: why were they defending themselves?

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:39.000
[Amit Varma]: They were guilty of sedition and they should just stand up proud and say that, yeah, of

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.240
[Amit Varma]: course, I am disaffected.

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:44.240
[Amit Varma]: I am preaching this affection, you know, so what is the crime?

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:47.360
[Amit Varma]: And Gandhi, Azad and Nehru actually do this.

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:53.120
[Amit Varma]: And they are all people who are protesting against the British by peaceful means using

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:56.200
[Amit Varma]: non cooperation and civil disobedience and so on.

01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:02.840
[Amit Varma]: And this sort of refreshing honesty owning up to what is quote unquote a crime, you know,

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:05.320
[Amit Varma]: seems to bring a moral force to the freedom struggle.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:10.440
[Guest]: See, this has a lot to do with the change in strategy, I would call it.

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:17.480
[Guest]: The Tilak of 1897 and the Tilak of 1916 did not want a British free India.

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:20.000
[Guest]: They did not want freedom as such.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.240
[Guest]: They wanted the power to govern themselves within the Commonwealth, within under the

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:30.360
[Guest]: patronage of the crown, dominion status, autonomous status.

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:34.120
[Guest]: They never in their life at that point of time had imagined that India could be completely

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.740
[Guest]: free of the British.

01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:40.800
[Guest]: So this Poon Swaraj thing which happened with Tilak and when he coined the term Swaraj is

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.600
[Guest]: my birthright and I'll have it.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:47.080
[Guest]: That happened later that not happened even at the time of a second trial, right?

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:54.680
[Guest]: So there was a shift in the Indian political scenario after 1919 when Gandhi came here.

01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:58.040
[Guest]: When and Gandhi in fact had become very unpopular, which I talked about just before his sedition

01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:01.400
[Guest]: trial, he had become very unpopular for calling off the civil disobedience movement because

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:05.680
[Guest]: of because of Chori Chori called it off and the people were very disillusioned.

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:09.240
[Guest]: In fact, if the British wouldn't have prosecuted him, maybe the Gandhi that we know of today

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.840
[Guest]: wouldn't have existed.

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:13.600
[Guest]: Maybe we wouldn't have assumed the kind of relevance that he did after that.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:14.600
[Guest]: Streisand effect.

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.600
[Guest]: Yes.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:16.600
[Guest]: So, exactly.

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:20.320
[Guest]: So we should maybe call it the Gandhi effect.

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:23.240
[Guest]: So basically what they did was they wanted complete freedom.

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.160
[Guest]: They wanted Indians to govern India.

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:27.040
[Guest]: They wanted Indians to frame their own laws.

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:30.480
[Guest]: They didn't want laws from England to run the country here.

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:34.760
[Guest]: So what they did was they said that I refuse to recognize the law.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:36.560
[Guest]: They say fine, this is sedition.

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.880
[Guest]: If you say it is sedition, it is sedition.

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.440
[Guest]: I refuse to recognize it.

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.480
[Guest]: Gandhi called it the prince of political offenses, right?

01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:48.600
[Guest]: So what they did was they said, I refuse to recognize your authority over me.

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:51.160
[Guest]: If you say it is sedition, fine, then I am seditious.

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.160
[Guest]: I have done it.

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:53.200
[Guest]: You punish me for it.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:55.400
[Guest]: And all of them asked for punishment.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.400
[Guest]: Nobody said, let me go.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:58.360
[Guest]: They said, give me the maximum punishment possible.

01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:02.160
[Guest]: Gandhi, in fact, said when they said that Tilak got six years, so you should also get

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.160
[Guest]: six years.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:07.040
[Guest]: Gandhi said he was privileged to be equated with Tilak for getting six years.

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:09.120
[Guest]: Nehru simply went up to the magistrate and said, you punish me.

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.640
[Guest]: I don't even want to fight you.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:11.640
[Guest]: There shouldn't be any trial.

01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:12.640
[Guest]: I'm admitting to everything.

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:13.640
[Guest]: The magistrate said, please don't do this.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:14.640
[Guest]: He said, please don't do this.

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:15.640
[Guest]: I'll get you out of it.

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:20.640
[Guest]: And he said, I'll make sure you don't have to face any prison.

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:23.480
[Guest]: Nehru said, thank you so much, but I don't want it.

01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:25.040
[Amit Varma]: I want the maximum penalty.

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:29.960
[Amit Varma]: And I want to quote something that Nehru says about the Congress here, which of course,

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:33.600
[Amit Varma]: the Congress then was a very, very different beast from what it is today.

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:37.840
[Amit Varma]: But quote, in the Congress, we have nothing to do with loyalty.

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:41.000
[Amit Varma]: We are disloyal and it is our business to preach this loyalty.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.440
[Amit Varma]: Are you going to be loyal to those people who humiliate your people, who degrade your

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:48.280
[Amit Varma]: country, or are you going to be loyal to your own country, to your own people?

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Indian nationalism and British imperialism are at close grips with each other.

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.920
[Amit Varma]: British imperialism may succeed in suppressing Indian nationalism.

01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:00.880
[Amit Varma]: But remember this also, that while Indian nationalism will grow again, but British imperialism

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:04.400
[Amit Varma]: will be suppressed once and for all by Indian nationalism.

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:05.400
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:08.880
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of the people who are talking rubbish about Nehru today should, you know, really

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.800
[Guest]: read up a little more on the sort of moral.

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.520
[Guest]: One man almost spent 10 years in jail.

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.440
[Guest]: He was in jail when his wife was in on her deathbed.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:20.200
[Guest]: In fact, he was only released because she was very sick.

01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:23.680
[Guest]: His father was in his deathbed when he got arrested when he came back to Allahabad and

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.320
[Guest]: they made that speech for which he eventually got arrested.

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:32.080
[Guest]: His father was unwell and his father was unwell because he had been arrested previously and

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:34.000
[Amit Varma]: he also refused to defend himself.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.560
[Amit Varma]: They spent their lives getting arrested.

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:36.560
[Guest]: Yes, they were in.

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.200
[Guest]: He was in prison for about 10 years.

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:42.640
[Guest]: His wife was in prison, mother went to prison and his father went to prison.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:45.880
[Guest]: Everyone at that point of time went to prison and they were proud of it.

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:54.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I must say this, you know, a lot of people sort of look at people like Nehru and

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Savarkar in very binary points of view that one is good and the other is evil.

01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:00.560
[Amit Varma]: And I'd say there are, it's more complicated than that.

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:04.320
[Amit Varma]: For example, it often comes up on Twitter that, hey Savarkar, apologize to the British

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.800
[Amit Varma]: and you contrast that with what Nehru is doing now.

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.680
[Amit Varma]: But it is also true that Savarkar went to the cellular jail in Andaman, known as Kalapani,

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:15.080
[Amit Varma]: where the sort of tortures inflicted on him were beyond anything, any other.

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.640
[Guest]: And not just physical torture, mental torture.

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:23.720
[Guest]: Damodar Savarkar talks about it when in their stories, it's clearly mentioned this man,

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:26.440
[Guest]: he would, he would swallow himself standing up.

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:27.680
[Guest]: He lost control of his bowels.

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:30.800
[Guest]: Yeah, they weren't allowed to go to the, they weren't allowed.

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.800
[Amit Varma]: This is really the smallest.

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:32.800
[Guest]: They were allowed to clean themselves.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:33.800
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.560
[Guest]: And they were supposed to toil in the sun.

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:39.800
[Guest]: If you've been to the Andaman, you'll realize how harsh that sun is.

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:43.720
[Guest]: And their cells were, the cells were so small.

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:48.680
[Guest]: As it's, I know some hotel rooms nowadays are very small, but it was even smaller than

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:49.680
[Guest]: that.

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:50.680
[Guest]: You couldn't stand up properly.

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:51.680
[Amit Varma]: You had to be bent all the time.

01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:55.320
[Amit Varma]: In fact, the two recent biographies of Savarkar by Vaibhav Varadhan and Vikram Sampath both

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.560
[Amit Varma]: deal with this at some length.

01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:01.560
[Amit Varma]: And you can go to the prison diaries of Savarkar himself and other people who were imprisoned

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:03.400
[Amit Varma]: with him to see how bad it was.

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:06.440
[Amit Varma]: So I would just say that we shouldn't always rush to judgment.

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:10.720
[Amit Varma]: I think Savarkar did some truly despicable things and gave rise to despicable ways of

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:15.600
[Amit Varma]: thinking in the twenties onwards, especially with his horrendously bad book Hindutva.

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:20.360
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, had he died in 1910, he'd probably be remembered as a hero today.

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:21.360
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:26.160
[Guest]: Because what he did in England, he set up India House there, the revolutionary activity

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.160
[Guest]: in England.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.720
[Guest]: He sent pamphlets from there to Bombay.

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:31.800
[Guest]: So both the brothers had a huge role to play at that point of time.

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:35.800
[Guest]: It's only after Kala Pani that the politics changed.

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:40.280
[Guest]: And I don't really, I may be criticized for this, but I don't really blame him for writing

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.560
[Guest]: a letter, a mercy petition.

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:43.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I would do the same.

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:45.720
[Amit Varma]: I would do the absolute same thing.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:46.720
[Amit Varma]: The kind of suffering.

01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:51.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, Gandhi, Nehru and all these people were basic, they were treated in a very civil

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:52.760
[Guest]: way.

01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:53.760
[Guest]: They were treated with a lot of respect.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:57.040
[Guest]: They had access to books, they had access to visitors.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:58.440
[Guest]: They had, they could write letters.

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.600
[Guest]: Nehru wrote his books while in prison.

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:05.360
[Unknown]: I mean, it was the only way he could have written, or maybe today people could write,

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.720
[Guest]: but maybe we should throw some people in prison for them to write.

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:12.480
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I have a huge amount of criticisms of Nehru for his economic policies post independence.

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:16.040
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, all these people contain multitudes and we should remember before we

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.480
[Amit Varma]: rush to judgment.

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:21.000
[Guest]: That's why I said that this access to history is very important.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.960
[Guest]: That we need to understand this.

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.160
[Guest]: I did not know half of all this when I was researching.

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:31.760
[Guest]: It's only after I read all this that I understood the context of the actions back then.

01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:35.280
[Amit Varma]: So we have to wind up in 20 minutes before you have a flight to catch.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:40.960
[Amit Varma]: So I want to move on from Gandhi, Nehru and Azad and talk about two sort of important

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:46.480
[Amit Varma]: cases just on the cusp of India getting independence, where important judgments were made regarding

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:47.480
[Amit Varma]: 124 A.N.

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:53.040
[Amit Varma]: One of them is Niharendu Dutt Majumdar versus the King Emperor, which is administered by

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:57.760
[Amit Varma]: the federal court, the sort of predecessor to the Supreme Court.

01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:59.200
[Amit Varma]: And this is a very interesting judgment.

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:00.200
[Guest]: Tell me why.

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:05.200
[Guest]: So basically, that's when the court created a distinction between mere speech, seditious

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:09.520
[Guest]: speech as they call it, and actually inciting violence.

01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:15.000
[Guest]: So sedition as it was understood more or less remained the same from bongo bashi to tilak

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.600
[Guest]: to the 1940s.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.520
[Guest]: The interpretation did not change.

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:23.680
[Guest]: For the first time, Justice Mori Squire, he brought in the interpretation which we today

01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:29.520
[Guest]: rely upon eventually in the Indian Supreme Court also interpreted the same way that mere

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:35.680
[Guest]: criticism is not seditious until and unless it causes violence.

01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:39.240
[Guest]: So just speaking simply, this is what he said.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:45.080
[Guest]: And eventually it had to be set aside because the criminal justice system of the day and

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:49.040
[Guest]: the politicians of the day thought that this man is ruining everything for us.

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:52.760
[Guest]: It was set aside eventually and the old system was again destroyed in the second case.

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:57.840
[Amit Varma]: And the other case you talk about is the Privy Council judgment of 1947, which sort of takes

01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:58.840
[Amit Varma]: the opposite view.

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:01.840
[Guest]: Yes, because they said that Squire is wrong.

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:04.520
[Guest]: He's gone beyond what is written in the statute.

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:06.360
[Guest]: And you should just stick to what the statute says.

01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:11.600
[Amit Varma]: And all of this has bearing, you know, there's also a drama playing out when the Indian Constitution

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:17.320
[Amit Varma]: is being written, because, you know, for example, what should our free speech laws be like,

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:19.280
[Amit Varma]: how much free speech should be guaranteed.

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.960
[Amit Varma]: And there are sort of debates about this.

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:27.800
[Amit Varma]: Some people are arguing for, you know, the like, US style free speech, where, you know,

01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:31.980
[Amit Varma]: which I also am broadly in agreement with where it's more or less absolute.

01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:35.680
[Amit Varma]: And others are saying that no, we need caveats and the questions come up, what should the

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:37.200
[Amit Varma]: caveats be?

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:45.280
[Amit Varma]: And there's a fierce argument about whether the word sedition should be one of the restrictions.

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:46.960
[Guest]: Tell me a bit about that and how that pans out.

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:51.100
[Guest]: So the first draft of Article 19 today was originally Article 13.

01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:54.920
[Guest]: And one of the restrictions on free speech back then was seditious speech.

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:59.520
[Guest]: So it was supposed to be it wouldn't have been protected by the fundamental right to

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:01.160
[Guest]: freedom of speech and expression.

01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:05.920
[Guest]: So that's when certain people in the Constituent Assembly and on the Fundamental Rights Subcommittee

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.400
[Guest]: opposed this.

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:11.760
[Guest]: They said that Patel is framing this from the point of view of a constable.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.280
[Guest]: Because the very translating that means that someone has to maintain law and order the

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:20.080
[Guest]: constable or the lowest police officer is responsible for maintenance of law and order.

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.080
[Guest]: This is Somnath Lahiri.

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:23.040
[Guest]: Somnath Lahiri who said this.

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:29.760
[Guest]: And Munshi talks about how this how his father and his grandfather, they were punished for

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:33.840
[Guest]: sedition and now this is being imposed on citizens in the Constitution.

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:40.300
[Guest]: So there is a quietly it was just removed from the restrictions on free speech by Patel.

01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:45.200
[Guest]: But it reappeared again and again faced huge criticism from the Constituent Assembly from

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:46.200
[Guest]: a lot of people.

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.040
[Amit Varma]: So it was eventually removed from the.

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:51.480
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing is that if it was eventually removed, you would assume that

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:57.520
[Amit Varma]: 124A would also go because what basically happened, put simply, correct me if I'm wrong,

01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:00.640
[Amit Varma]: is that we took the entire IPC as it was.

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:04.800
[Amit Varma]: And we basically said that whatever in it is contradictory to something in our Constitution

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:06.320
[Amit Varma]: is immediately repealed.

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.160
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise it stays as it is.

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:12.680
[Amit Varma]: So the assumption was that because of word sedition has been removed from Article 19,

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:18.200
[Amit Varma]: that therefore the sedition law, which is 124A will also cease to be active.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:22.360
[Amit Varma]: And that in fact, an early ruling was to that effect.

01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:26.520
[Amit Varma]: But then the First Amendment we made to our Constitution changed all that.

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:31.840
[Guest]: So basically what the courts did was they gave the blessing to the law.

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:39.360
[Guest]: And they in fact went back to the interpretation given pre-independence interpretation given.

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:45.520
[Guest]: So it actually made the situation even worse than what the Assembly feared that was what

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:47.120
[Guest]: was happening.

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:53.240
[Guest]: Because early India, early democratic India was not able to actually, they were still

01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:55.920
[Guest]: fearful that hangover was still there.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:00.720
[Guest]: They still felt that people because they had just seen a anti-establishment movement, they

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:03.320
[Guest]: still felt that people still have those tendencies within them.

01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.320
[Amit Varma]: Maybe that's why.

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:09.680
[Amit Varma]: And I did an episode with the historian Gyan Prakash and he spoke about how when the framers

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:13.640
[Amit Varma]: of the Constitution were in that locked room, sort of framing the Constitution, there was

01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.280
[Amit Varma]: violence all across the country outside.

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:17.800
[Guest]: It was by no means a given that we will stay one nation.

01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:19.880
[Amit Varma]: They just come out of the partition violence.

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:26.360
[Amit Varma]: Can you see the context of violence 1857, then the revolutions of the post Bengal splitting

01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:32.480
[Amit Varma]: the sort of early 20th century and now again the post partition violence and that is determining

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:34.680
[Guest]: how draconian the laws are.

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:39.180
[Guest]: Because then the violence was not a nationalistic in nature, it became religious.

01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:42.080
[Guest]: So they had still had that fear.

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:45.760
[Guest]: Every government has that fear that it will be overthrown not maybe for political reasons,

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:47.260
[Guest]: but maybe for religious reasons.

01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:49.920
[Guest]: So that is why they allowed the law to exist on the books.

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.720
[Amit Varma]: So now let's get to this seminal case called Kedarnath Singh versus State of Bihar.

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:57.760
[Amit Varma]: As you pointed out earlier, what happens with the First Amendment is that one of the caveats

01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:03.040
[Amit Varma]: introduced is public order and the courts therefore now begin to argue about whether

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:08.700
[Amit Varma]: the introduction of this caveat means that the sedition law is constitutional after all.

01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:12.520
[Amit Varma]: And you basically have the Patna High Court saying that 124A is constitutional.

01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:15.480
[Amit Varma]: The Manipur High Court says it's partly unconstitutional.

01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:19.520
[Amit Varma]: The Allahabad High Court finds it to be completely unconstitutional.

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:22.720
[Amit Varma]: And then comes Kedarnath Singh versus State of Bihar.

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:28.240
[Guest]: So the politics of the time, the Communist Party of India was quite popular and quite

01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:33.740
[Guest]: powerful and we were at a time where the Congress was the largest party and the second largest

01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:35.640
[Guest]: party was the Communist Party.

01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:42.720
[Guest]: And in Bihar, this gentleman delivered a speech where he called police the dogs of CID and

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:47.200
[Guest]: said that he was spoken in the bureaucracy.

01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:51.880
[Guest]: So he was arrested for sedition under the Congress government and he was arrested for

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:52.880
[Guest]: sedition.

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.640
[Guest]: So eventually when the court and he was convicted for it as well.

01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:55.800
[Guest]: And this was not the only case.

01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:59.040
[Guest]: This was actually a batch of matters from UP and Bihar.

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:03.640
[Guest]: And when these matters eventually reached the Supreme Court, what the Supreme Court

01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:10.400
[Guest]: held which applies till date is that till that time, even though they went back to Morris

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:18.680
[Guest]: Goir's interpretation in Niranjan Dutta and they simply said that public order, if there

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:23.880
[Guest]: is a restriction on public order on free speech, that means that there has to be public disorder

01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:27.760
[Guest]: for that speech to be seditious.

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:34.960
[Guest]: As long as public order is not disturbed, that speech cannot be curtailed.

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:37.420
[Guest]: So public disorder means violence.

01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:41.800
[Guest]: It means just disturbing the status quo somewhere causing law and order problems.

01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:49.120
[Guest]: So till the time a writing or a play or a movie or a speech does not incite violence

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:55.440
[Guest]: or public disorder or have the tendency of doing that, that test has to be there for

01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:58.280
[Guest]: anything to be declared as seditious.

01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:03.920
[Guest]: So very simply put that today, if I say something and that causes people to take up arms against

01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:09.240
[Guest]: the government or it may cause people to take up arms against the government, any such thing

01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:14.480
[Guest]: will not be seditious till the time that test is met, that it can cause violence or incite

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:15.480
[Guest]: violence against the state.

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:19.680
[Guest]: Because you have to understand, it's not just violence against a community or violence against

01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:23.820
[Guest]: a group of or of a political party.

01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:27.380
[Guest]: The law is categorized under the offense of against the state.

01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:34.080
[Guest]: So it has to be by that very, very simple logic, it has to be violence against the state

01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:36.120
[Guest]: and the state today is all powerful.

01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:38.720
[Guest]: 20 individuals cannot overthrow the state.

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:41.240
[Guest]: A thousand individuals cannot overthrow the state.

01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:43.000
[Guest]: The state is not brittle today.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:49.200
[Guest]: So what that judgment did was that it introduced that test of violence being caused or likelihood

01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:50.900
[Guest]: of violence to be caused.

01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:54.600
[Guest]: But unfortunately it is not being followed in spirit.

01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:59.480
[Amit Varma]: In fact, a lot of people don't even know many aspects of the procedural implications of

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:00.480
[Amit Varma]: 124A.

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:03.880
[Amit Varma]: Like one of the ways in which you point out it has evolved is, for example, in the state

01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:09.400
[Amit Varma]: of Maharashtra, you know, it's not enough for someone to say file a case of sedition

01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:10.480
[Amit Varma]: against me.

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:15.520
[Amit Varma]: It has to also be approved by the government of the day before I can be hauled into court.

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:20.120
[Amit Varma]: But many constable level police inspector level cops don't actually know this.

01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:24.680
[Amit Varma]: And therefore the sedition law has become a tool of harassment.

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:29.800
[Guest]: In fact, in all of India, only Maharashtra has these guidelines.

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:34.240
[Guest]: And these guidelines also arise out of a court case when Asim Trivedi was being prosecuted

01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:36.240
[Guest]: for sedition after he drew those cartoons.

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:37.240
[Guest]: 2014, I think.

01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:38.240
[Guest]: Yes.

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:40.760
[Guest]: So the court simply said it may be distasteful.

01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:43.240
[Guest]: You may not like it, but that does not make it seditious.

01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:45.000
[Guest]: It did not incite any violence.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000
[Guest]: Nothing happened.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.220
[Guest]: So why is he in jail for sedition?

01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:49.840
[Guest]: So they set down guidelines.

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:55.360
[Guest]: They said that a person cannot even be arrested for under section 124A till the time there

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:59.960
[Guest]: is a written opinion of a law officer and the investigation has to be done by a senior

01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:02.880
[Guest]: police officer among many other things.

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:04.640
[Guest]: So it laid down these guidelines.

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:07.440
[Guest]: Other than Maharashtra, no other state has these guidelines.

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:14.800
[Guest]: Even when a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court saying that you have to enforce Kedarnath,

01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:16.320
[Guest]: the court simply said follow Kedarnath.

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:19.040
[Guest]: It did not lay down any guidelines again.

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:23.880
[Guest]: So today what situation is that across the country, there is no sanction required for

01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:24.880
[Guest]: arrest.

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:28.200
[Guest]: A sanction is only required when a charge sheet is to be filed and charges are to be

01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:29.800
[Guest]: framed against you.

01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:31.400
[Guest]: But prior to that, there is no sanction required.

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:34.520
[Guest]: Otherwise, it's required under 196 of CRPC.

01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:37.320
[Guest]: So to arrest someone for sedition is very easy.

01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:41.920
[Guest]: To fire a person to go to court and get a fire registered for sedition is very easy.

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:48.360
[Guest]: So what I spoke about here to build a safety wall here as well is that create a provision

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.000
[Guest]: or create a or at least issue guidelines across it should be by from the central government

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:59.880
[Guest]: to all the states that even to arrest someone under 124A, you need prior sanction or the

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:04.400
[Guest]: approval of a high ranking or IG, DG level police officer without a can't even arrest

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.400
[Guest]: someone for sedition.

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:07.840
[Amit Varma]: And the argument is that we do have other laws like UAPA.

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:09.880
[Guest]: So we don't really need which is a very stringent law.

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:11.240
[Amit Varma]: It is a draconian law in itself.

01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:12.320
[Amit Varma]: We should go by itself.

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:14.560
[Amit Varma]: But you're saying it's a political reality is there to stay.

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:17.120
[Amit Varma]: So why not at least do away with sedition?

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:19.240
[Amit Varma]: So you know, we'll have to wind up soon.

01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:21.520
[Amit Varma]: So I'll have one final sort of question for you.

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:23.600
[Amit Varma]: And I'd urge all the listeners to read the book.

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:28.360
[Amit Varma]: And if we focused on the historical aspect of it so far, that's what the book also does

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:31.960
[Amit Varma]: extremely well, and which is extremely important.

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:36.280
[Amit Varma]: But to read the later chapters about how the sedition law is in modern times, do read the

01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:37.280
[Amit Varma]: book.

01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:40.560
[Amit Varma]: My question to you is this and here I will be slightly mischievous.

01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.360
[Amit Varma]: And I will invert Mr. Tilak's argument and use it against the law which was used to imprison

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:50.360
[Amit Varma]: him, which is Tilak's argument back in the day when the age of consent law was passed,

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:55.160
[Amit Varma]: was that look, this is a necessary law, but society is not ready for it.

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:56.160
[Amit Varma]: Most people agree with this.

01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.600
[Amit Varma]: So change has to happen gradually.

01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.520
[Amit Varma]: It cannot be imposed top down.

01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:06.320
[Amit Varma]: Now in the modern time, you and I are sort of elite liberals who don't believe in all

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:10.280
[Amit Varma]: of these free speech laws like 124A, 153A, 295A.

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:12.720
[Amit Varma]: We would just like them to go right.

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:19.240
[Amit Varma]: But a modern day Tilak could make the argument that society actually agrees that free speech

01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:23.320
[Amit Varma]: should not be absolute and these laws are necessary, and that the state is absolute

01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:25.480
[Amit Varma]: and it is a crime to be against the state.

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:29.240
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, society is not ready for these laws to go and we need these laws.

01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:30.240
[Amit Varma]: How would you respond to that?

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:33.420
[Guest]: No, so I would say let the data speak for itself then.

01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:40.560
[Guest]: If you look at NCRB data on 124A, which they started compiling from 2014, the number of

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:43.280
[Guest]: FIRs are measly.

01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.640
[Guest]: The numbers are very, very low.

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:47.160
[Guest]: They claim there have been two convictions.

01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:49.080
[Guest]: The NCRB report claims one conviction.

01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:51.080
[Guest]: The MHA in Parliament claims two convictions.

01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:54.560
[Guest]: I haven't found even a single conviction in these two years.

01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:56.560
[Guest]: So your argument is no one is getting convicted under it?

01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:57.560
[Guest]: And the chilling effect is massive.

01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:58.880
[Guest]: The chilling effect is massive.

01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:03.680
[Guest]: So what I'm saying is today at the end of the day, in these three years now, with the

01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:09.840
[Guest]: 2017 report coming out from 2014 to 2017, only six sedition trials have been concluded.

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:12.320
[Guest]: Only six trials have been concluded.

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:16.160
[Guest]: And if that is the rate at which trials have been concluded and no one's been convicted

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:20.440
[Guest]: and most cases are dying even before charge sheets are being filed, then what are you

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:21.440
[Guest]: doing with this law?

01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:22.440
[Guest]: Why is this law in existence?

01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:25.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, one could then argue that there are also good laws with low conviction rates.

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:27.440
[Amit Varma]: So does that mean don't have the laws on the book?

01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:28.440
[Guest]: Could be, could be.

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:34.160
[Guest]: But this law, when you have UAPA, when you have laws against destruction of public property,

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:35.680
[Guest]: that is what everyone is being accused of.

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:40.240
[Guest]: If they say violence, even the violence is only against public property, no one can overthrow

01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:41.240
[Guest]: the government.

01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:42.240
[Guest]: The government is not brittle.

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.800
[Guest]: I keep saying this, that the government is not brittle today.

01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:48.040
[Guest]: So all they say is someone burnt a few buses, so convicting for sedition is not right.

01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:49.280
[Guest]: There are other laws to take care of that.

01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:54.240
[Guest]: There's laws to take care of murder, there are laws to take care of arson, of everything's

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.240
[Amit Varma]: in place.

01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:56.320
[Amit Varma]: You don't need this.

01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:59.320
[Amit Varma]: So let me ask you a postscript to my final final question, which you can answer very

01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:03.440
[Amit Varma]: briefly before you run through Bombay traffic to try and get to your flight in time.

01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.920
[Amit Varma]: Good luck with that.

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:10.840
[Amit Varma]: And the question is that, you know, I remember writing columns 10 years ago against 377 against

01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:15.000
[Amit Varma]: the adultery law, and they're both gone today, that you know, things evolved to a stage where

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.400
[Amit Varma]: they could go naturally with no outcry and no interest groups insisting on keeping those

01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:20.400
[Amit Varma]: laws.

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.400
[Amit Varma]: Are you hopeful of a time?

01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:25.360
[Amit Varma]: And if so, how long will it take that before many of these draconian laws, especially these

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:29.560
[Amit Varma]: sort of free speech laws, and even laws like the UAPA, you know, that our society matures

01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:32.760
[Amit Varma]: enough to say that, hey, we don't need this in a healthy democracy.

01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:38.080
[Guest]: We may mature enough to say so, our political parties have to mature enough to do that.

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:39.240
[Guest]: Is it a demand and supply?

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:43.880
[Guest]: No, it's not really because at the end of the day, they are the ones who come to power,

01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:47.800
[Guest]: it could be a Congress, it could be a BJP, it could be a TMC, it could be anyone.

01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:49.920
[Guest]: But for them, it's a very useful tool to have.

01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:50.920
[Guest]: Why would they give it up?

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:52.080
[Guest]: Why would they give it up?

01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:56.080
[Guest]: So it's a political party which has to mature and say, you know, I'm not afraid of this.

01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:59.480
[Guest]: So they are the ones who have to mature at the two hopeful statements were made very

01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:03.960
[Guest]: recently by two Supreme Court judges, one of whom will become the Chief Justice of India

01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:09.720
[Guest]: after the tenure of the next two and, and he says that when a cartoonist is arrested

01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:12.920
[Guest]: for sedition, the constitution weeps.

01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:19.200
[Guest]: And Justice Deepak Gupta recently gave a speech in Ahmedabad where he criticized the law of

01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:20.200
[Guest]: sedition.

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:22.440
[Guest]: So hopeful statements are coming forward.

01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:27.440
[Guest]: But then at the same time, we have a Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah and other politicians

01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:31.760
[Guest]: of the BJP saying that this law is required and we will make it stronger.

01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:35.600
[Guest]: So that's why I'm saying people may still believe that law should go.

01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:39.280
[Guest]: It's a political parties were to be mature enough to say they're not afraid of criticism.

01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:43.200
[Guest]: They're not afraid of people saying that what you're doing is wrong.

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:44.200
[Guest]: They have to take it sportingly.

01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:48.120
[Guest]: They know that the country cannot be overthrown by a motley group of critics.

01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:49.240
[Amit Varma]: It's as simple as that.

01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:52.640
[Amit Varma]: After doing so much to come to power, why on earth would you give some of it up?

01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:55.840
[Amit Varma]: On that hopeful note, Chitranchal, we could have spoken for hours more.

01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:57.640
[Guest]: You should have been here tomorrow morning.
