00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.360
[Guest 2]: I had a strange dream the other night.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.440
[Amit Varma]: I saw my wife in a dream.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.360
[Amit Varma]: Now this is unusual by itself, who dreams about this pals?

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.000
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, in my dream, I was in an amorous mood and I went into my bedroom hoping to interest

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.200
[Amit Varma]: my lovely wife in some playful interaction.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.600
[Amit Varma]: She was curled up on the bed, laughing to herself in a way I only see when she is laughing

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.060
[Amit Varma]: at my jokes.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.960
[Amit Varma]: She had an electrode plugged into her brain.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.480
[Amit Varma]: I opened my mouth to say something, and she held up her hand and shushed me.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.160
[Amit Varma]: I don't need to talk to you anymore, she said.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.640
[Amit Varma]: There is no longer any need for any actual physical interaction between us.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.880
[Amit Varma]: What are you talking about, I said?

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.080
[Amit Varma]: How can you say such a thing?

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.480
[Amit Varma]: Don't you love me anymore?

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.240
[Amit Varma]: Oh, I love you very much, she said.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.200
[Amit Varma]: But now I have an enhanced version of you.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.520
[Amit Varma]: I uploaded your brain on this device a week ago when you were sleeping, and now there

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.440
[Amit Varma]: is an AI version of you here which makes even better conversation than you do.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.240
[Amit Varma]: It has all the good things about you, your wit, your knowledge, but none of the bad stuff

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.200
[Amit Varma]: like your inflated sense of self-importance, your lack of empathy, your short attention

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.320
[Amit Varma]: span.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.240
[Amit Varma]: You are Amit 1.0.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.880
[Amit Varma]: This is Amit 2.0.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.880
[Amit Varma]: Oh, damn, I had always feared this day would come.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.920
[Amit Varma]: But that's just conversation, I said.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.720
[Amit Varma]: What about the physical stuff?

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.720
[Amit Varma]: What about cuddling?

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.720
[Amit Varma]: Ha!

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.720
[Amit Varma]: She laughed.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.720
[Amit Varma]: That's also sorted.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.280
[Amit Varma]: See, Amit, people are a technology to make you feel a certain way.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.120
[Amit Varma]: When you hug me, oxytocin floods through me.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.360
[Amit Varma]: Well, now I can replicate the firing of neurons that leads to that without actually having

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.200
[Amit Varma]: to hug an actual human.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.840
[Amit Varma]: In fact, over the last few weeks, I have saved all my experiences with you into the hard

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.280
[Amit Varma]: drive right here.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.920
[Amit Varma]: Now I can replay them any time I want and even tweak some details.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.000
[Amit Varma]: I don't need you at all.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.040
[Amit Varma]: I was very sad when I heard this.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.520
[Amit Varma]: I started pouting, but as my natural resting face is a pout, I must have looked the same.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.400
[Amit Varma]: OK, fine, I said.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.720
[Amit Varma]: I understand.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.600
[Amit Varma]: I apologize for intruding.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.040
[Amit Varma]: I'll just go and record next week's podcast now.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.360
[Amit Varma]: You don't need to, she said.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.360
[Amit Varma]: It's done.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.560
[Amit Varma]: I'm listening to it now.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.440
[Amit Varma]: You talk about me in your intro.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.440
[Amit Varma]: How sweet.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:31.840
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.840
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.560
[Guest 2]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badmaa.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.400
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.520
[Amit Varma]: In today's episode, I'm going to be talking about artificial intelligence, which is changing

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.760
[Amit Varma]: the world around us, mostly in good ways.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.200
[Amit Varma]: Unlike some alarmists, I have nothing but positive feelings about A.I.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.480
[Amit Varma]: I have two guests on the show today who share my optimism, but are also aware of both positive

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.320
[Amit Varma]: and negative unseen effects of artificial intelligence.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.120
[Amit Varma]: Ramesh Naam is a renowned futurist and award-winning science fiction novelist.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.600
[Amit Varma]: He works at the Singularity Institute, and I urge you to Google him and read some of

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.980
[Amit Varma]: his essays on A.I.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.200
[Amit Varma]: Also on the show today is Pawan Srinath, my colleague at the magazine Pragati, who has

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.760
[Amit Varma]: studied some of the public policy implications of A.I., such as universal basic income.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.640
[Amit Varma]: Ramesh and Pawan, welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.640
[Guest 1]: Thanks Amit.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.640
[Amit Varma]: Thanks Amit.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.520
[Amit Varma]: Ramesh, you've written a lot about artificial intelligence, and I've been reading a lot

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.200
[Amit Varma]: of your stuff and it's amazing.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.760
[Amit Varma]: So tell me something, especially in India, there's a fear that people have about artificial

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.760
[Amit Varma]: intelligence, that it's going to decimate jobs, especially in the service industry,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.760
[Amit Varma]: for example.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.920
[Amit Varma]: And like at one level, the scene effect of artificial intelligence creates enormous value.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.760
[Amit Varma]: And it might seem the unseen effect is a job loss, but to a lot of us here in India, the

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.400
[Amit Varma]: job loss is also sort of the scene effect.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400
[Amit Varma]: What are we missing?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.640
[Guest 2]: What's the bigger picture here?

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.960
[Guest 2]: Well, I think the dialogue is pretty far ahead in India, if you're already talking about

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.640
[Guest 2]: job loss from automation.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.440
[Guest 2]: I do think we should just acknowledge for a moment that the big obvious effect of A.I.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.160
[Guest 2]: and digital technology in general is lots of wealth creation and lots of deflation of

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.520
[Guest 2]: the cost of services that were once impossible.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.840
[Guest 2]: We all have more access to information than any U.S. president before Bill Clinton, let's

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.160
[Guest 2]: say, basically for free.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.160
[Guest 2]: So that's amazing.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.160
[Guest 2]: Amazing, right?

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.360
[Guest 2]: Now, will A.I. destroy jobs?

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.360
[Guest 2]: Who knows?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.320
[Guest 2]: I would say it will destroy some jobs for sure.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.840
[Guest 2]: But overall have a macro effect of destroying jobs.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.080
[Guest 2]: I am cautious about predicting that because it's been predicted so many times that A.I.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.840
[Guest 2]: would destroy jobs or that automation would destroy jobs in a macro sense.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.880
[Guest 2]: And it hasn't ever been right, at least not for the long term.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.680
[Guest 2]: I'll give you an example of that.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.680
[Guest 2]: We'll answer your question eventually.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.120
[Guest 2]: I'll give you an example of that is Ned Ludd.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.480
[Guest 2]: The Luddites are named after him.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.240
[Guest 2]: Ned Ludd may or may not have actually existed.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.480
[Guest 2]: We don't really know if he was a real person or not.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.480
[Guest 1]: Fake news.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.560
[Guest 2]: Ned Ludd might be fake news.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.240
[Guest 2]: But he apocryphally destroyed artificial weaving machines because he thought that they would

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.040
[Guest 2]: take jobs from weavers and textile workers.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.320
[Guest 2]: But the invention of those machines actually increased demand for textiles so much that

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.640
[Guest 2]: more people were employed in the industry 10 years later than had been before they were

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.120
[Guest 2]: around because they brought down the price of textiles that made clothing much more affordable

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.560
[Guest 2]: and that spurred demand.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.120
[Guest 2]: It was a positive some sort of thing.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.120
[Guest 2]: Okay.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.280
[Guest 2]: So we have some humility about predicting the future.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.360
[Guest 2]: But let's imagine that it does destroy some jobs.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.280
[Guest 2]: The example you and I were talking about last night is Norman Borlaug.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.680
[Guest 2]: Norman Borlaug started the Green Revolution in the 1940s.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.560
[Guest 2]: He bred better wheat and better rice that doubled crop yields around the world, helped

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.000
[Guest 2]: save India from massive famine, saved Mexico from massive famine.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.960
[Guest 2]: They say he fed a billion people, saved a billion lives, maybe more than anyone in history.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.480
[Guest 2]: Borlaug grew up in sort of a poor town in Iowa in the US.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.920
[Guest 2]: He had no electricity, no running water.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.560
[Guest 2]: And the reason he is who he is today is that he would have grown up to just be a farmer

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.680
[Guest 2]: following in his parents' footsteps.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.720
[Guest 2]: But his family was able to get a Ford mechanical tractor.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.400
[Guest 2]: And that Ford tractor destroyed Borlaug's job of being a menial laborer on the farm.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.960
[Guest 2]: But that let him go to high school, not even university, high school.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.720
[Guest 2]: And that led to him having the skills to combine new ideas to produce these better crops that

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720
[Amit Varma]: feed us all.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.720
[Amit Varma]: That changed the world.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.720
[Amit Varma]: That changed the world.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.720
[Amit Varma]: And made him a hero in India.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.520
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, I'm always an evangelist for technology.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.500
[Amit Varma]: To me, the unseen effect of more technology is always positive.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.760
[Amit Varma]: You know, you might see some immediate job loss in the short term, if at all, but so

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.640
[Amit Varma]: much extra value is created that it goes back into the economy and the world is better off

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.640
[Amit Varma]: than it was before.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.640
[Amit Varma]: It's a positive sum game.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.240
[Amit Varma]: What I don't have answers to and what people often ask me is in the specific Indian context

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.880
[Amit Varma]: where we are, where we as a nation, we're growing younger and younger, we have a million

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.880
[Amit Varma]: people coming into the workforce every month, and there simply aren't enough jobs getting

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.600
[Amit Varma]: generated for them.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:29.880
[Amit Varma]: And what I see happening is that a lot of our service industry is low-end kind of services

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.800
[Amit Varma]: which can easily be replaced by AI, and it's already started happening.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.540
[Amit Varma]: And plus, while we never had a manufacturing industry because of our labor laws and whatever,

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.760
[Amit Varma]: that is a non-starter now simply because automation won't allow it to happen.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.920
[Amit Varma]: So now, I understand that in the long term, great things will happen, and I also buy your

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.800
[Amit Varma]: point about having humility about predicting the future because the future is, of course,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.360
[Amit Varma]: full of unknown unknowns, as it were, in this case.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.120
[Amit Varma]: So no one can possibly, no one could have predicted at the time Balogh's parents bought

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.640
[Amit Varma]: a tractor that it would lead to the Green Revolution.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.360
[Amit Varma]: That was an unknown unknown.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.840
[Amit Varma]: But before the long term comes, we got to deal with the short term sort of social unrest

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:13.720
[Amit Varma]: that is likely, the demand on policy makers to somehow ameliorate this is likely.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.640
[Amit Varma]: And when people ask me all this, I really don't have any answers anymore.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.640
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.060
[Guest 2]: It is complex, and there are parts of it that are really scary.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.960
[Guest 2]: We know whether or not the macro job destruction happens.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.800
[Guest 2]: We know that micro job destruction will happen.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.840
[Guest 2]: In the U.S., we talk a lot about truck drivers.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.920
[Guest 2]: In most U.S. states, truck driver is the most common profession, but those might be automated

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.120
[Guest 2]: away in the next 10 years, even if it goes very slowly, maybe 20 years.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.120
[Guest 2]: So what do they go do?

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.620
[Guest 2]: There's about 3 million people in the U.S., about 1% of the U.S. population drives a vehicle

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.620
[Guest 2]: for a living.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.000
[Guest 2]: And I see a lot of people in India that do that as well.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.800
[Guest 2]: So maybe, and I'm optimistic about this, the total number of new jobs created by technology

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.560
[Guest 2]: will be much larger than the number that are destroyed.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.480
[Guest 2]: But still, what do you do with those people?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.480
[Guest 2]: I hope for a couple of things.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:09.520
[Guest 2]: I hope, one, that technology that's disrupting driving or that's disrupting music or newspapers

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.760
[Guest 2]: might also disrupt education.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.660
[Guest 2]: So MIT, one of the world's top universities, has said they will make all of their curriculum

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.400
[Guest 2]: available for free.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.480
[Guest 2]: We have AI in video games that knows how skilled you are and plays just hard enough for it

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.760
[Guest 2]: to be an engaging experience for you and, in fact, makes it addictive.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:33.320
[Guest 2]: Could we have AI tutors in your phone, in your tablet, that have access to all of this

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.600
[Guest 2]: curriculum that know what questions you're getting right and wrong and tailor the education

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.280
[Guest 2]: for you in a way that no human teacher with 30 or 40 kids could do?

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.680
[Guest 2]: That sounds like science fiction, right?

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.520
[Guest 2]: But it was science fiction for a robot to be driving a car just 10 years ago.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:55.200
[Guest 2]: So if we do that, is there a chance we can take children throughout the world that maybe

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.720
[Guest 2]: don't have good schooling and give them amazing schooling, far better than now, for pennies,

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.280
[Guest 2]: billions of them, and even take adults who are taxi drivers?

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.340
[Guest 2]: They might not have the same ability to learn new skills, but I'll bet we can retrain them

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.800
[Guest 2]: into some new jobs if we deploy this sort of technology for them.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.600
[Amit Varma]: So let me play devil's advocate for a moment.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.320
[Amit Varma]: A government policymaker, say 10 years down the line in India, might well say that, look,

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.200
[Amit Varma]: I buy that technology as a whole is a great thing, but I can approach different aspects

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.200
[Amit Varma]: of it differently.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.800
[Amit Varma]: For example, if truckers across the country are losing jobs, I can ban self-driving cars

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.920
[Amit Varma]: or, you know, tax them or whatever, and I can let the education happen.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.480
[Amit Varma]: It's not as if I have to have the same approach to a disruptive technology and to technology

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.320
[Amit Varma]: which clearly does the kind and I absolutely share your optimism on the online education

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.320
[Amit Varma]: bit.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.160
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, at a policy level, if it's approached like that, and even in the popular imagination,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.440
[Amit Varma]: I mean, populism dominates the world today.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:59.480
[Amit Varma]: I don't see it very far, like for the same reason, like, for example, some of Trump's

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:05.080
[Amit Varma]: victory is definitely due to job loss, which he attributes to a jobs being shipped overseas

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.560
[Amit Varma]: and be immigrants coming and taking the jobs and a significant chunk of them are because

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.560
[Guest 2]: of automation.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.440
[Guest 2]: How long before the anger goes in that direction?

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.400
[Guest 2]: I do think unrest is a real issue.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:21.520
[Guest 2]: I do think people see their way of life changing and they have economic anxiety, the sort of

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:28.600
[Guest 2]: a hollowing out of the blue collar workforce in the US, the manual laborers that used to

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.680
[Guest 2]: work in manufacturing and so on.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.360
[Guest 2]: Service jobs are vulnerable, but they have not been hurt as much so far.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.560
[Guest 2]: I think India does have some vulnerability there.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.880
[Guest 2]: So you have to figure out how to deal with that.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.080
[Guest 2]: And I think part two is you have to have a social safety net.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:48.400
[Guest 2]: You have to have some way to say, okay, if your job has been destroyed, we are going

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:55.920
[Guest 2]: to take care of you for a while with incentives for you to learn something new that is valuable

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.760
[Guest 2]: to society, that that should be the number one thing that we ask someone to do if we

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.400
[Guest 2]: are taking care of them when they're not employed is we should ask them to learn fundamentally.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.240
[Amit Varma]: Pavan, Ramesh mentioned the social safety net and you've been reading and thinking and

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.960
[Amit Varma]: writing about universal basic income, for example, among other things.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.520
[Guest 1]: What are your thoughts?

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:23.200
[Guest 1]: I think universal basic income seems to be the latest idea in welfare that has picked

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.200
[Guest 1]: up speed.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.000
[Guest 1]: The idea has been around for a while, various flavors of it have existed.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.500
[Guest 1]: There's the idea of a negative income tax, for example, and I think it's good that this

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:39.960
[Guest 1]: discussion is happening in the United States because I think they are prosperous enough

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.040
[Guest 1]: to have that conversation.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:48.000
[Guest 1]: In India, even if you take the pie, you redistribute it, you get rid of administrative costs,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.760
[Guest 1]: you get 3,000, 4,000 rupees per person per year, if pushed, maybe 20,000 rupees per

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.200
[Guest 1]: person per year.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:01.040
[Guest 1]: And when you're providing that as cash and you don't have public goods that are available,

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.760
[Guest 1]: then your efficiency in using that cash is very limited.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.160
[Guest 1]: You don't have a road to travel on, you have the money to buy a scooter now, but that's

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.360
[Guest 1]: not going to help.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.600
[Guest 1]: So I think our conversations have to be a little different and I want to ask a question

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.160
[Guest 1]: on this.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:22.880
[Guest 1]: I think one of the ways to ameliorate economic anxiety on this is when people can think of

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:30.020
[Guest 1]: easy first entry jobs that can be created in this new space.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.080
[Guest 1]: If I'm looking at what's happening in India over the last five, 10 years with e-commerce

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:41.520
[Guest 1]: becoming a big thing, with new startups sort of achieving scale, is that you have a lot

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.960
[Guest 1]: of these jobs that people can quickly get into.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:52.000
[Guest 1]: You're a driver, you're a delivery guy, you are in many other places and these are being

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.240
[Guest 1]: created rapidly.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.920
[Guest 1]: So one of the reasons why startups have worked in India so far is while they have hit at

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:03.120
[Guest 1]: disrupted old businesses, they've disrupted the black and yellow taxi cabs in Mumbai,

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.000
[Guest 1]: but they've also created these jobs.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.240
[Guest 1]: So there's a new constituency of people who are batting for them.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.840
[Guest 1]: So in AI, Ram, do you see any opportunities for such jobs?

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.520
[Guest 2]: I think we do.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:21.320
[Guest 2]: And I would say that here's a slightly more sophisticated way to think about job destruction.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:25.160
[Guest 2]: Most of the time, automation does not destroy a whole job.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.640
[Guest 2]: What it does is that a job is a basket of tasks.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.140
[Guest 2]: Let's say your job has 10 tasks.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.840
[Guest 2]: Let's say you are a delivery man.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.400
[Guest 2]: Some of your tasks is you walk in to the restaurant and you get the food, you walk back out, you

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.160
[Guest 2]: know the address, a bunch of your job is you drive there, and then another part of your

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.080
[Guest 2]: job is you get out, you walk up to the house, you knock, you give the person their food,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.080
[Guest 2]: collect the money.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.960
[Guest 2]: Well, technology might automate away the driving part, but that last, not even the last mile,

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.480
[Guest 2]: the last hundred meters is actually quite difficult to automate away.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.640
[Guest 2]: And drones, we can have fantasies about the taco drone all we want, but it just doesn't

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.760
[Guest 2]: make a lot of economic sense for some time.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.560
[Guest 2]: And we see that in a variety of other things.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.320
[Guest 2]: In white-collar work, in service work, we see the same thing.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.520
[Guest 2]: So I'll give you an example of something not in the tech industry.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:18.960
[Guest 2]: Being a lawyer in the U.S., one of the large things that you do in a big, complicated case

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.360
[Guest 2]: is discovery.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.360
[Guest 2]: What is discovery?

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.920
[Guest 2]: Reading through thousands, or hundreds of thousands, or millions of documents to find

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.360
[Guest 2]: something interesting.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:34.960
[Guest 2]: So now we have AI that can automate, can semi-automate, can make that part of the job the most boring,

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.480
[Guest 2]: least fun, least intelligently demanding part of the job, much more streamlined, and it

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:44.200
[Guest 2]: can free up the attorney to do the most important parts, the negotiation, the arguing in court,

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.200
[Guest 2]: and so on.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.160
[Guest 2]: So I actually, I'm not sure that in many of these cases that we'll see people just go

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.160
[Guest 2]: away.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:58.320
[Guest 2]: But the truckers that I talked about, if that trucking job is automated, you still have

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.280
[Guest 2]: someone that needs to refuel that vehicle.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.640
[Guest 2]: You still have the people that need to load and unload it.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.040
[Guest 2]: Some of that will be automated, not all of it.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.200
[Guest 2]: You are reducing the cost of shipping goods.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.880
[Guest 2]: That will probably, in turn, increase the demand for shipping goods.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.120
[Guest 2]: And the way that textile demand went up when the price went down, that, in turn, will create

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.920
[Guest 2]: ancillary jobs.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.880
[Guest 2]: So that's what I see, and I can't tell you exactly what that looks like.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:29.000
[Guest 2]: But I think if, for instance, if India had fully autonomous vehicles, every single one,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.940
[Guest 2]: A, the traffic would move five times faster, right?

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.800
[Guest 2]: And what economic surplus does that have for everyone in India?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.880
[Guest 2]: And B, will that actually create more demand for delivery services that employ a human

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.880
[Guest 2]: in some way?

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.680
[Guest 2]: Maybe the human has to do four other tasks during the drive, but he's still going to

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.680
[Guest 1]: do something.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.680
[Guest 1]: Right.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.680
[Guest 1]: Absolutely.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.540
[Guest 1]: And how do we get this exact analogy just with Uber and Ola in India?

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:58.880
[Guest 1]: If you had to be a taxi driver in an Indian city, say, 15 years ago, you needed to know

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.120
[Guest 1]: the city first, right?

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.600
[Guest 1]: You needed a geographic map of the city.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.640
[Guest 1]: You needed a mental map of this.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.680
[Guest 1]: And now, because Google Maps has automated that, any first-time driver, so long as they

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.320
[Guest 1]: know driving and they know the rules of the road reasonably well, they can just get on

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.320
[Amit Varma]: the road.

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.640
[Amit Varma]: It's going to be easier for people to become drivers and, you know, therefore increase

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.640
[Guest 1]: jobs in that space.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:28.320
[Guest 1]: So, like you said, if certain tasks that require extensive experience or training become obvious

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:33.400
[Guest 1]: with the use of technology, maybe some jobs might increase in certain sectors.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.400
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.360
[Guest 2]: Maybe the future of meal delivery is going to be that it's a mobile kitchen and the person

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.320
[Guest 2]: is – the work they're doing is they're cooking inside while it's driving automatically from

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.320
[Guest 2]: each place to each place.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.080
[Guest 2]: I don't know.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.640
[Guest 2]: I'd like to come back to the universal basic income, though, because when I do the math

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.520
[Guest 2]: – I just do the math in the back of the envelope – what I come to the conclusion

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.720
[Guest 2]: of is we should talk about basic income and not universal basic income.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:05.360
[Guest 2]: Because if you target it at the bottom 20% of society, let's say, you get five times

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.680
[Guest 2]: as many rupees that you can spend on those people.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.680
[Guest 2]: So I think we should think of it as a safety net, something that phases out gradually and

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.360
[Guest 2]: slowly with income rather than being universal.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.940
[Guest 2]: There's various arguments for universal that gets more politically popular if everyone

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.960
[Guest 2]: gets some, but it's just not as efficient.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.800
[Guest 2]: I don't need that income myself.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.760
[Guest 2]: I would rather that a poor person gets more than I do.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.760
[Guest 1]: Right.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:38.440
[Guest 1]: I think the argument in favor of a universal anything is that the cost of targeting might

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:44.760
[Guest 1]: and the challenges of mis-targeting might outweigh the cost of universalization, and

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.880
[Guest 1]: I think with technology that might be proven wrong.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:53.800
[Guest 1]: We'll need to see how Aadhaar and other things in India can be deployed meaningfully to make

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.800
[Amit Varma]: targeting successful.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:00.760
[Amit Varma]: What Aadhaar will do is it will provide universal surveillance.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.180
[Guest 1]: So while we're looking at that angle, I think the original purpose of the Aadhaar was how

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.760
[Amit Varma]: do we manage horribly bloated subsidies in India, how do we get the targeting right,

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.160
[Amit Varma]: how do we make sure the right guy is…

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.160
[Amit Varma]: I fully agree with you.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.160
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:20.120
[Amit Varma]: So let me end by asking a question of what could either be a utopian or a dystopian future.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:27.280
[Amit Varma]: Now typically we imagine that, you know, whenever new technology comes, it might cause short

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.800
[Amit Varma]: term micro job losses, but it creates value and that value goes back into the economy

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.360
[Amit Varma]: and that creates more jobs.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.720
[Amit Varma]: Now what happens in a future scenario where artificial intelligence and automation together

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.080
[Amit Varma]: can essentially satisfy every human need, right?

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.120
[Amit Varma]: And in which case whatever value is created goes back into AI and automation because any

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.440
[Amit Varma]: need that any human can have is possibly satisfied.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.680
[Amit Varma]: Now the dystopian vision is that, my God, there are no jobs and what are people going

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.720
[Amit Varma]: to do?

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.960
[Amit Varma]: And we need to protect the people and the utopian vision is that everything will be

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.440
[Amit Varma]: so cheap because productivity is so high that people don't need jobs.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.480
[Guest 2]: Where's the balance, I mean?

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.880
[Guest 2]: So I think people do like having a purpose in life.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.240
[Guest 2]: So we have to worry about that and also expect that people will look for a purpose in life.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.160
[Guest 2]: But I also become very, very cautious about predictions like this.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.760
[Guest 2]: John Maynard Keynes, arguably the greatest economist of the 20th century, predicted that

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.640
[Guest 2]: in the USA by today, actually like 2000 I think, people would work an eight-hour work

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:34.920
[Guest 2]: week because he said per capita income grows at 2% per annum and so by 2000 everyone should

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.800
[Guest 2]: be able to work eight hours and have a good quality of life.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.000
[Guest 2]: I wish he meant a 1920s level quality of life.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
[Amit Varma]: And in the U.S.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.680
[Amit Varma]: I wish they could get with eight hours of work.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.000
[Guest 2]: Maybe you could work eight hours and have a 1920s quality of life, but no one wants

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
[Guest 2]: to.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
[Guest 2]: Almost.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.240
[Guest 2]: A few people do.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.240
[Guest 2]: Human needs expand.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:58.240
[Guest 2]: I'll tell you just from my country, because I know the stats, the living space per capita

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:04.240
[Guest 2]: in the U.S., number of square meters per capita, has gone up by a factor of three since 1970.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.240
[Guest 2]: Right?

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.240
[Guest 2]: Why?

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.440
[Guest 2]: Because people, given the option, like space.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.460
[Guest 2]: The number of miles flown per capita has gone up by a factor of like 20 since 1970.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.660
[Guest 2]: People like to travel.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:19.520
[Guest 2]: So human needs are not so easily satisfied.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.160
[Guest 2]: Some people would view that as a horrible thing.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.800
[Amit Varma]: I view it as a sort of a positive.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.480
[Amit Varma]: And maybe we all need to go to Mars.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.600
[Guest 2]: Elon Musk might think so.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.320
[Amit Varma]: For now, guys, thank you for coming on the scene in the unseen.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.720
[Amit Varma]: It was a pleasure talking to you.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.720
[Guest 1]: Thank you.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.720
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.320
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for listening so far into the show.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.840
[Amit Varma]: In a future age, this podcast will be uploaded directly to your brain.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.320
[Amit Varma]: For now, though, we live in the cumbersome physical world where I urge you to head over

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:52.040
[Amit Varma]: to your nearby online or offline bookstore and pick up any of the books written by Ramesh.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:58.320
[Amit Varma]: His award-winning Nexus Trilogy, in particular, is a blast to read and very, very thought-provoking.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:04.280
[Amit Varma]: Pawan and I both write for Pragati at ThinkPragati.com, and you can also check out my blog, IndiaUncut

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.040
[Amit Varma]: at IndiaUncut.com.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.880
[Amit Varma]: Do come back for more next week.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:13.280
[Amit Varma]: Long after humans have become post-human, the seen and the unseen will keep coming at

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:24.640
[Amit Varma]: you week after week after week.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.600
[Unknown]: Next week, on the seen and the unseen, Amit Verma will be talking to Pranay Kotastane

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:44.040
[Amit Varma]: about centrally-sponsored schemes.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:23:12.680
[Unknown]: He profiles LGBT people from all across the country, and some of the stories are really

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.680
[Unknown]: poignant.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.320
[Unknown]: Check it out.
