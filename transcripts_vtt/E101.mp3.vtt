00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
[Amit Varma]: Before you listen to this episode of The Scene and the Unseen, I have a recommendation for

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.160
[Amit Varma]: you.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.280
[Amit Varma]: Do check out Pulya Bazi, hosted by Saurabh Chandra and Pranay Kotesane, two really good

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.280
[Amit Varma]: friends of mine.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.400
[Amit Varma]: Kick-ass podcast in Hindi, it's amazing.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.240
[Amit Varma]: A few days ago, my aunt in the US wrote to me.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.280
[Amit Varma]: She is visiting India at the end of January, after many years, and wanted to know what

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.040
[Amit Varma]: gift I wanted from there.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.800
[Amit Varma]: I assured her that I wanted nothing, but she insisted, saying that she was going to get

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.840
[Amit Varma]: me a gift anyway, and it might as well be something I wanted that I could not get in

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.840
[Amit Varma]: India.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.160
[Amit Varma]: That got me thinking.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.440
[Amit Varma]: I grew up as a kid in the 1980s, and in those days when our relatives visited from America,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.080
[Amit Varma]: they would come laden with unimaginable, almost magical goodies.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.680
[Amit Varma]: There was so much that you did not get in India.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.080
[Amit Varma]: But now, wracking my brains, I couldn't think of anything that I could not get here.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.720
[Amit Varma]: Clothes, electronics, perfumes, books, music, and everything is available here.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.880
[Amit Varma]: Finally, I asked my aunt to get me some assault rifles.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.160
[Amit Varma]: But in a larger sense, this got me to thinking how much my world has changed.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.480
[Amit Varma]: Back in the day, we used to scramble even to listen to good music.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.920
[Amit Varma]: We'd spend days sourcing music and getting mixtapes made, and every new song we gathered

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.920
[Amit Varma]: was like a treasure.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.320
[Amit Varma]: We had limited ways of watching movies from around the world, and I remember how eagerly

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.480
[Amit Varma]: we tuned in to watch the one eclectic film per week that Doordarshan showed in a late

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.680
[Amit Varma]: night slot.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.720
[Amit Varma]: People often speak of how the film, in which Annie gives it those ones, was shown only

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.120
[Amit Varma]: once on Indian television.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.600
[Amit Varma]: Well, I remember watching it that one time, as I am sure do many other Indian kids my

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.600
[Amit Varma]: age.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.600
[Amit Varma]: There was nothing else.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.100
[Amit Varma]: Today, we can play any song we want to on Google Play or Amazon Prime or Apple Music.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.920
[Amit Varma]: We can stream a whole world of movies, and the technology on our phone today is the science

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.520
[Amit Varma]: fiction of yesterday.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.680
[Amit Varma]: I think it was my friend Uday Shankar who once said that the next generation will not

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.760
[Amit Varma]: know what it is like to get lost.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.760
[Amit Varma]: That's right.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.760
[Amit Varma]: GPS Zindabad.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.880
[Amit Varma]: Though as a caveat, battery is Murdabad.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.360
[Amit Varma]: But battery life aside, our lives are just bloody astonishing.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:20.680
[Unknown]: And we take all this progress for granted.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.040
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.480
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Steven Pinker, who I regard as one of the great public intellectuals of

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.080
[Amit Varma]: our times, and someone who's been a huge personal influence on me.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.780
[Amit Varma]: My favorite book by Pinker is The Blank Slate, which shone a light on what exactly human

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.480
[Amit Varma]: nature is and where it comes from, and gave me a deep sense of the contingency of my existence

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.040
[Amit Varma]: and my personality and my identity.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.000
[Amit Varma]: All that is a recipe for humility, but it also gave me a sense of awe and wonder at

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.160
[Amit Varma]: the complexity of the machinery in our brains.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.800
[Amit Varma]: But the book that is the subject of this episode is his latest book Enlightenment Now, which

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.400
[Amit Varma]: demonstrates using exhaustive data, how the world has gotten better across every metric

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.560
[Amit Varma]: that we can possibly think of, and how we need to respect enlightenment values if we

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.920
[Amit Varma]: are to preserve and enhance this fragile progress.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.920
[Amit Varma]: I met Steven at the sidelines of the recent Times Literary Festival in Mumbai, and we

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.520
[Amit Varma]: recorded in a makeshift studio we set up at the venue.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.520
[Amit Varma]: So please do excuse us for any sound disturbances.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.160
[Amit Varma]: Also, I'd originally requested a two hour interview.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.240
[Amit Varma]: He promised me an hour instead, but due to unavoidable circumstances, he needed to wrap

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.840
[Amit Varma]: it up in 40 minutes.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.320
[Amit Varma]: So I couldn't quite manage to unwind into the sort of long leisurely conversation I

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.320
[Amit Varma]: like.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.080
[Amit Varma]: But 40 minutes with Steven Pinker is still 40 minutes of enlightenment now, who can complain

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.080
[Amit Varma]: about that?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.880
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a quick commercial break and get right into the conversation.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.280
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.320
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.280
[Amit Varma]: Well, worry no more, head on over to IndianColors.com.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.240
[Amit Varma]: Indian Colors is a company that licenses images of the finest modern art from some of the

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.160
[Amit Varma]: best artists in India and adapts them into objects of everyday use.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.480
[Amit Varma]: These include wearable art, like stoles and shrugs, home decor like cushion covers and

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.300
[Amit Varma]: table runners, and accessories like tote bags.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.080
[Amit Varma]: This allows art lovers to actually get fine art into their homes at an accessible price,

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.600
[Amit Varma]: and artists get royalties on sales, just like authors do.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.840
[Amit Varma]: What's more, Indian Colors now has an exciting range of new products, including fridge magnets

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.440
[Amit Varma]: with some stunning motifs, and salad bowls and platters made of mango wood.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.200
[Amit Varma]: Their artists include luminaries like Babu Xavier, Vasvo X Vasvo, Brinda Miller, Dilip

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.840
[Amit Varma]: Sharma, Shruti Nelson, and Pradeep Mishra.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.280
[Amit Varma]: They accept bulk orders for corporate and festival gifting, but even if you want to

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Stephen, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.960
[Amit Varma]: Stephen, when I'm with my friends, I often ask them a question about what book changed

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.960
[Amit Varma]: the way they think about the world.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.520
[Amit Varma]: And when the question comes back on me, my answer often is a blank slate, which of course

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.240
[Amit Varma]: you published in 2003.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.580
[Amit Varma]: I want to turn the question back to you today.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.360
[Amit Varma]: What is a book or what are the books which changed the way you view the world?

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.800
[Guest]: For me, there was not a single book I've written on many topics, and so my worldview on each

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.520
[Guest]: one of these topics was shaped by different books.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.680
[Guest]: And also I tend not to be influenced by one thought leader or one theory.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.380
[Guest]: I'm pretty eclectic, so there's usually a set of books that influences me.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.640
[Guest]: When it comes to the topic of my most recent book, Enlightenment Now, probably the single

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.080
[Guest]: book that influenced me the most might have been David Deutsch's The Beginning of Infinity,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.360
[Guest]: which put the whole idea of progress and enlightenment in a coherent framework.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.320
[Guest]: But I was also influenced by books on global economic development, Charles Kenney's Getting

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:06.320
[Guest]: Better, Hans Rosling's podcasts and TED Talks and his recent book, Factfulness.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:13.560
[Guest]: For the changes in war, I was influenced by the books of a political scientist named John

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.040
[Guest]: Mueller.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.280
[Guest]: So it's always hard for me to pin down one book.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.640
[Guest]: For other topics such as how the mind works, I was influenced by the writings of John Tooby

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.680
[Guest]: and Lita Kosmides, the evolutionary psychologists who are friends of mine, and Richard Dawkins

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.580
[Guest]: and Robert Trivers.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.680
[Guest]: In the case of the language instinct, I was influenced by, of course, the writings of

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.160
[Guest]: Noam Chomsky, such as Language and Mind, Reflections on Language, both of which I read when I was

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:47.480
[Guest]: a student, as well as books by founders of psycholinguistics, that is the merger of linguistics

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.480
[Guest]: with psychology, such as George Miller and one of my advisors, Roger Brown.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.480
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.400
[Amit Varma]: And in your book, you started by saying that the thinkers of the Enlightenment code laid

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.200
[Amit Varma]: that foundation in what we now call humanism, which privileges the well-being of individual

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.440
[Amit Varma]: men, women and children over the glory of the tribe, race, nation, or religion, basically

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.960
[Amit Varma]: thinking in terms of individuals.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:18.320
[Amit Varma]: And you point out three processes which make it possible, entropy, evolution, and information.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.200
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you just mentioned John Tooby, and you know, one of the memorable quotes of your

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.720
[Amit Varma]: book is when the title of a paper by him, the second law of thermodynamics is the first

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.720
[Amit Varma]: law of psychology.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.440
[Amit Varma]: So, tell me a bit about why is entropy your central concept?

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.040
[Guest]: I think there are discoveries of science that ought to be fundamental to our understanding

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.880
[Guest]: of the human condition, just who we are, where we came from, what are our challenges.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.920
[Guest]: Entropy is one of them.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.200
[Guest]: The concept originally derived from thermodynamics that because there are so many more ways in

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.640
[Guest]: which things can be disordered, or random, or useless, and ordered, or structured, or

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:04.280
[Guest]: disordered, over the natural course of events, things go from orderly to chaotic, to random,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:12.360
[Guest]: to disordered, unless there is the application of energy and knowledge, information that

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:18.200
[Guest]: can create circumscribed zones of order or structure, even if the universe as a whole

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.800
[Guest]: is more disordered, but at least in parts of the world close to us, it can be more ordered,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:30.080
[Guest]: such as growing food, such as making shelters, such as fighting decay.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.600
[Guest]: So entropy being one of a number of concepts that are fundamental to our understanding

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.480
[Guest]: of reality that were developed after the Enlightenment.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.120
[Guest]: The Enlightenment thinkers by no means thought of everything.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.520
[Guest]: And what entropy means is that we should realize that human effort and human knowledge are

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.840
[Guest]: always necessary, even to preserve the life that we enjoy now, let alone to make a better

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:59.160
[Guest]: life, that we don't need to find evil people, or forces, or demons that are trying to make

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:04.560
[Guest]: life difficult for us, that life being difficult is just what happens because of the laws of

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.960
[Guest]: the universe, unless we combat it.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.880
[Guest]: Evolution is another idea that is critical to understanding the human condition, also

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:19.480
[Guest]: only discovered after the Enlightenment, namely that what makes us what we are, the process

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.200
[Guest]: of natural selection, did not shape us to be, to live in harmony, to be happy, to be

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.200
[Guest]: healthy.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:33.360
[Guest]: Rather, evolution is driven by competition, amoral competition, and so human nature was

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:39.240
[Guest]: what was selected to prosper in that competition, and therefore human nature by itself does

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:46.040
[Guest]: not incline us to be particularly wise or beneficial just to be able to survive.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:52.480
[Guest]: Now that includes abilities such as cognition, reason, problem solving, it includes emotions

00:09:52.480 --> 00:10:00.640
[Guest]: like empathy, sympathy, self-control, that we can try to co-opt and strengthen to improve

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:07.320
[Guest]: our life, but only if we decide to enhance those parts of our nature can we expect human

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.320
[Guest]: life to improve.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:15.000
[Guest]: Then the third concept is information, just the idea that order, non-randomness, knowledge

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.920
[Guest]: can be measured, can be explained in terms of material carriers of information, such

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.800
[Guest]: as brains, such as communications media.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:35.240
[Guest]: So we can understand the whole world of knowledge, ideas, in a rigorous way that does not contradict

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.000
[Guest]: the idea that we are hunks of matter that were produced by evolution, because we know

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.880
[Guest]: that physical objects can be processors of information, including brains.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.440
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you talk about progressophobia, or what you call, and there's a great quote

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.000
[Amit Varma]: from you where you say, start quote, intellectuals hate progress.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.440
[Amit Varma]: Intellectuals who call themselves progressive really hate progress.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.080
[Amit Varma]: It's not that they hate the fruits of progress, mind you.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.920
[Amit Varma]: Most pundits, critics, and their bien-pensant readers use computers rather than quills and

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.520
[Amit Varma]: inkwells, and they prefer to have their surgery with anesthesia rather than without it.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.040
[Amit Varma]: It's the idea of progress that rankles the chattering class, the enlightenment belief

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.400
[Amit Varma]: that by understanding the world, we can improve the human condition, stop quote.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.400
[Amit Varma]: Why do intellectuals hate progress?

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:26.280
[Guest]: Yes, some of it is, it has not always been true, and of course it's not true of all intellectuals.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:33.480
[Guest]: There does seem to be a major strain of intellectual thought of people who write op-eds in newspapers,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.240
[Guest]: social critics, authors of books.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.200
[Guest]: Part of it is just professional competition.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.880
[Guest]: Most intellectuals aren't in charge of running things.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:48.560
[Guest]: They aren't in charge of delivering clean water or curing disease or policing the streets

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:55.960
[Guest]: or negotiating peace, and so it's very easy to criticize society, which is a way of criticizing

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:01.480
[Guest]: other elites, other professionals, that everyone else is failing but them, and they're here

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:07.540
[Guest]: to point out the failings of their professional rivals, so I think that's one reason.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:14.440
[Guest]: Another is that many of the processes that have improved the human condition don't necessarily

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:22.700
[Guest]: consist of what intellectuals deal with, verbally articulated propositions.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.080
[Guest]: No one kind of voted the Industrial Revolution.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:33.760
[Guest]: No one decided, no one even understands exactly why it was an increase in peace and a decline

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:42.680
[Guest]: in war since 1945, and processes that take place gradually through distributed knowledge

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:48.420
[Guest]: are markets, or another example, natural languages as they develop over the course of history.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.420
[Guest]: No one's in charge.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:56.480
[Guest]: No one plans them, and many intellectuals distrust processes of order that weren't designed

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.000
[Guest]: and implemented according to the principles laid down by intellectuals.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.120
[Amit Varma]: Like Adam Ferguson said, a lot of human progress comes from human action, not human design,

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.780
[Amit Varma]: and intellectuals perhaps think in a top-down way, rather than understand the bottom-up

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.900
[Amit Varma]: spontaneous order which leads to markets, language, and so much progress.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.900
[Guest]: That's right.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:21.300
[Guest]: Now, in some cases, it really was the verbally articulated propositions of intellectuals

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:27.840
[Guest]: that did lead to progress, such as in the design of democracy in the United States around

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.300
[Guest]: the time of the founders, such as scientific theories that were put into practice, such

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.600
[Guest]: as vaccination and the germ theory of disease.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:45.420
[Guest]: So it's not as if everything arises just from spontaneous cooperation, but aspects of human

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:51.760
[Guest]: progress that were not planned tend to be dismissed by many intellectuals.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.720
[Amit Varma]: You also point out to a number of biases, like the optimism gap, the availability bias,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:02.360
[Amit Varma]: the negativity bias, that we tend to sort of perceive the world as being worse than

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.360
[Amit Varma]: it is.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.200
[Amit Varma]: And you have a great chart in your book which shows how media coverage, even as the world

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.600
[Amit Varma]: is getting better, media coverage gets more and more negative.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.720
[Amit Varma]: And as a journalist, we are always taught to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:22.080
[Amit Varma]: but obviously bad news sells, and no one's reporting that, hey, nothing happened today.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.080
[Amit Varma]: Everything was peaceful.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:30.080
[Guest]: Yes, and there are certain distortions that are just built into the nature of journalism

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.800
[Guest]: that will affect people's perception of the world.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.800
[Guest]: We know that people's perception of risk and danger and probability is driven by available

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.240
[Guest]: examples in memory, the availability heuristic it's called.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:50.240
[Guest]: And what journalism delivers is available instances for memory, explosions and gaffes

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:56.760
[Guest]: and disasters, things that are mediagenic tend to be bad because bad things can happen

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.080
[Guest]: very quickly.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.200
[Guest]: Good things tend to build up gradually, such as the reduction in, say, global extreme poverty,

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.960
[Guest]: which has declined by about 137,000 people per day.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.040
[Guest]: That can add up over 30 years to a billion and a quarter people have escaped from extreme

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.040
[Guest]: poverty, a major transformation of the world that people are unaware of because there was

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:21.440
[Guest]: never a Thursday in October in which it happened all of a sudden, it just gradually crept up.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:27.760
[Guest]: But together with these inherent distorting factors, just because of the nature of journalism,

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:33.600
[Guest]: there is also part of the culture of journalism that puts negativity as a kind of a moral

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.320
[Guest]: virtue that if journalists report anything that's going well, they're now considered

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.680
[Guest]: to be corporate public relations hacks or government propagandists.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.880
[Guest]: It's almost considered to be against journalistic ethics to report what goes well and that the

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.720
[Guest]: mission of journalism is to expose how the world is terrible and getting worse.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:01.200
[Guest]: Now, of course, journalism obviously has to report the disasters, the crises, the catastrophes,

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.680
[Guest]: but if it's biased in that direction, then I have argued that it can lead to outcomes

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:13.120
[Guest]: that are worse than mere complacency, can lead to fatalism, to people thinking, well,

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.360
[Guest]: if things just get worse and worse no matter how many efforts have been applied to making

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.240
[Guest]: it better, well, what's the point of trying to make things better?

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.240
[Guest]: Everything fails.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:28.720
[Guest]: Let's just enjoy ourselves individually while we can because hopes for reform are futile.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:34.200
[Guest]: It can also lead to radicalism, to people just giving up on institutions of liberal

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.020
[Guest]: democracy saying, let's just destroy it all because anything that replaces it is bound

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:44.640
[Guest]: to be better than what we have now, or to leaders who promise, only I can solve the

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.600
[Guest]: problems, only I can fix it.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.920
[Guest]: The entire establishment is so corrupt that you need to vote in someone who is powerful

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.400
[Guest]: and charismatic like me.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.640
[Amit Varma]: So I agree with you, of course, but there's also the dilemma that, you know, like I'm

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.640
[Amit Varma]: an editor as well, and let's say you're the editor of a large newspaper.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.640
[Amit Varma]: What do you tell your people?

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.760
[Amit Varma]: How do you change this culture?

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.600
[Amit Varma]: Because ultimately for your newspaper to survive, you've got to print news that people want

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.960
[Amit Varma]: to read, and you're catering to human nature in a sense.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:16.600
[Guest]: Well, although it's not as if mainstream newspapers have hit on a formula for financial success

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:21.520
[Guest]: over the last 10 years, and a lot of people say that they now, a majority, according to

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:27.600
[Guest]: a Reuters poll, say that the news depresses them so much that they simply avoid it altogether.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:35.280
[Guest]: There are data that suggests that even if the negative stories get more clicks, that

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:41.400
[Guest]: positive stories, at least stories that involve some positive affect, tend to last longer.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:49.080
[Guest]: They have a longer tail, and they are more likely to lead people to sign up and subscribe.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:55.600
[Guest]: So it may not be true that the only way to keep up clicks and eyeballs is to report disasters.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.600
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about enlightenment now.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:01.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, you've got a great, you know, you quote a great question that Amos Tversky asked you,

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.280
[Amit Varma]: which is, quote, how much better can you imagine yourself feeling than you're feeling right

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.280
[Amit Varma]: now?

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.240
[Amit Varma]: How much worse can you imagine yourself feeling?

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.240
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.040
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, you know, when I read this, it was like, I can imagine myself a little

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.040
[Amit Varma]: bit better, but not really too much.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.800
[Amit Varma]: And there's no end to how much worse I can be, which kind of illustrates the thesis of

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.800
[Amit Varma]: your book that the world has just gotten so much better.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:28.400
[Guest]: Well, it illustrates how a feature of human psychology that we often leaves us unappreciative

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.080
[Guest]: of the progress that's taken place.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.280
[Guest]: Somebody's observation about our emotional life, a feature of our psychology, sometimes

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:42.080
[Guest]: called the negativity bias, probably reflects the law of entropy that we talked about earlier,

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.680
[Guest]: namely, there really are more things that can go wrong than can go right.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.240
[Guest]: And the things that can go wrong can hurt you a lot more than things that go right can

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.400
[Guest]: help you.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:19:02.480
[Guest]: So there is an adaptive design to being more capable of feeling pain, more sensitive, or

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.680
[Guest]: vigilant for disaster, because there really are a lot of ways things can go wrong.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.400
[Amit Varma]: And in addition to loss aversion, it's just a package deal that is...

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.400
[Guest]: Yes.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:18.040
[Guest]: And what it leaves us ill-equipped to do is appreciate the kind of global and national

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:27.240
[Guest]: changes that can best be appreciated by data, by a more global synoptic view that aren't

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.520
[Guest]: things that naturally occur to us, but that we can best appreciate through data.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.800
[Guest]: Although, of course, we also appreciate them in our day-to-day life.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.960
[Guest]: Those of us who've lived long enough know that it really is better that you can stream

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.800
[Guest]: a movie whenever you want than have to wait for years for it to show up at a theater.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.280
[Guest]: We know that dentistry is approved, that medical procedures have approved.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:53.960
[Guest]: Many procedures now don't require cutting a person open, but can be done endoscopically.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.960
[Guest]: So we do tend to notice these things, but they don't leave as much of an impact on our

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.600
[Guest]: mood and our psychology as they should if you consider them objectively.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.640
[Amit Varma]: And what you've done in the very comprehensive second section of Enlightenment now is you've

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.120
[Amit Varma]: looked at all the different parameters that you can use for judging human welfare, like

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.520
[Amit Varma]: life, health, wealth, and so on, and shown how across all of them things have got better.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.160
[Amit Varma]: Let's just skip through them one by one very quickly.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.960
[Amit Varma]: In your chapter on life, I was very struck by this Johan Norberg quote about Kenya, where

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.960
[Amit Varma]: he's talking about Kenya between the years 2003 and 2013.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.620
[Amit Varma]: And he says, quote, after having lived, loved, and struggled for a whole decade, the average

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:39.640
[Amit Varma]: person in Kenya had not lost a single year of their remaining lifetime.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.120
[Amit Varma]: Everyone got 10 years older, yet death had not come a step closer, which, stop quote,

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.920
[Amit Varma]: which basically means in those 10 years, the life expectancy went up by 10 years.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.920
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.920
[Guest]: Yes.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:55.940
[Guest]: No, it is quite striking how, particularly in poor countries, how much life has improved

00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:01.240
[Guest]: in a way that most Westerners and citizens of rich countries don't appreciate.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:06.480
[Guest]: Because we're stuck with our images from the 1970s of the African kids with the swollen

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:13.760
[Guest]: bellies, surrounded by flies, and of the beggars with the bulls.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:19.600
[Guest]: And we don't appreciate how much both health and prosperity and education, all three of

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.960
[Amit Varma]: those have increased in poorer countries.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.360
[Amit Varma]: And when I talk about life expectancy going up, people often tell me that, oh, it's because

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.200
[Amit Varma]: child mortality rates are gone.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.920
[Amit Varma]: But as you show through all your graphs in that particular chapter, it's not just that

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.360
[Amit Varma]: child mortality rates have gone down.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.800
[Amit Varma]: Across the board, like even life expectancy for people reaching 50, for people who reach

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.000
[Amit Varma]: 65, across the board, life expectancy has just shot up.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.280
[Guest]: Yes, which is important.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.760
[Guest]: I did check that because of course, averages can be misleading.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.760
[Guest]: And if it was simply that more babies were surviving, well, every time a baby survives,

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.400
[Guest]: you're adding many decades onto the average.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.440
[Guest]: And so that could be misleading, even though of course, that itself would be a tremendous

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.980
[Guest]: moral progress if we prevented children from dying.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:05.120
[Guest]: But it's even better than that, in that, as you summarized it accurately, a 60-year-old

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.320
[Guest]: has more years of life ahead of them now than a 60-year-old several decades ago.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.240
[Amit Varma]: Let's go to your chapter on Chris.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.880
[Amit Varma]: I was, you know, struck by the Chris Rock quote there, this is the first society in

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.540
[Amit Varma]: history and obviously he's talking about America, not India.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.960
[Amit Varma]: This is the first society in history where the poor people are fat.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:29.440
[Guest]: Yes, I'd rather, the kind of tactless but accurate comment that only a comedian can

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.440
[Guest]: get away with.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.680
[Guest]: Although nowadays, even comedians can't get away with them.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:39.000
[Guest]: But yes, obesity is a terrible problem in rich countries.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.440
[Guest]: But as problems go, it's certainly better than malnutrition and starvation.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.480
[Amit Varma]: And then you also write about how knowledge grows energy.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, one example of that being Norman Borlaug's Green Revolution, where you write,

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.760
[Amit Varma]: quote, thanks to the Green Revolution, the world needs less than a third of the land

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.040
[Amit Varma]: it used to need to produce a given amount of food.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.920
[Amit Varma]: Another way of stating this bounty is that between 1961 and 2009, the amount of land

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.560
[Amit Varma]: used to grow food increased by 12%, but the amount of food that was increased grew by

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.560
[Amit Varma]: 300%.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:19.320
[Guest]: Yes, and it's not only a benefit to humanity to have more available food, but it's also

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.640
[Guest]: a benefit to the ecosystem, to the environment, the planet.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:30.400
[Guest]: A newer approach to environmental protection, sometimes called eco-modernism or eco-pragmatism,

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.760
[Guest]: which is different from the traditional green movement.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:41.200
[Guest]: Green movement tends to argue that we have to reduce our consumption, slow down or reverse

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:47.560
[Guest]: economic growth, live a more frugal lifestyle closer to nature.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.400
[Guest]: And what we know is people don't want to do that, especially people in poor countries

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.600
[Guest]: who quite rightly want to get rich or at least want to achieve the standard of living that

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.400
[Guest]: countries in the West enjoy.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:04.840
[Guest]: The eco-modernist movement says that what we should aim to do to protect the planet,

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:10.080
[Guest]: which we must do, it is an imperative, is to achieve the greatest human benefit with

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.360
[Guest]: least environmental cost.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:18.320
[Guest]: And a lot of that requires densification, getting the same human benefit with less land

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:24.200
[Guest]: so that the land that is not exploited by humans can be preserved or even revert back

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.640
[Guest]: to a natural situation.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:32.000
[Guest]: So that includes more intensive agriculture, that is growing more food on less land, which

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.440
[Guest]: means not more organic agriculture, but higher tech agriculture, especially bread, hybrid

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:44.680
[Guest]: varieties, genetically modified organisms, precision agriculture of the kind developed

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:51.040
[Guest]: in Israel that delivers the least amount of water and fertilizer to exactly where it's

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.080
[Guest]: needed, when it's needed.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.480
[Guest]: And as farms contract, forests expand, which is a good thing.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:03.240
[Guest]: Likewise, cities are good for the environment because you have people concentrated on less

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.240
[Guest]: land.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.960
[Guest]: That means that more land can revert to natural conditions.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.080
[Guest]: It also means that people use less energy because if you live in a city, you can walk

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.440
[Guest]: a block to get a quart of milk, you don't have to get in your car and drive several

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.840
[Guest]: miles as Americans often do.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.880
[Guest]: It means that there's less energy expended in heating homes in the winter.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.320
[Guest]: Because if people live in apartment buildings and one person's ceiling is another person's

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:34.360
[Guest]: floor and the heat can be shared, it means that you're spending less time in cars and

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.540
[Guest]: more shorter trips or pedestrian traffic.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.680
[Guest]: So in general, cities paradoxically are good for the environment.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.560
[Amit Varma]: And also the general advantages of urbanization that you have denser economic networks, therefore

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.920
[Amit Varma]: you have more specialization, more division of labor, more wealth.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:55.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, the next chapter is on wealth where, you know, you go back to entropy and about

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:59.000
[Amit Varma]: how poverty is like the default condition, which people don't understand.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.320
[Amit Varma]: People often feel entitled to wealth, not knowing that poverty is really the default

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.320
[Amit Varma]: condition and you quote the economist Peter Barr here saying, poverty has no causes, wealth

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.560
[Amit Varma]: has causes.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.800
[Amit Varma]: And then you lay out some of these causes for us.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.800
[Guest]: Yes.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.280
[Guest]: And that is a consequence of entropy and evolution.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:22.840
[Guest]: Entropy is, of course, that in general, things that we find useful because they are highly

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:29.480
[Guest]: structured like food, as opposed to, you know, sand or dust, don't arise by themselves.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:36.320
[Guest]: They require special processes, including the input of energy, sunlight and fertilizer.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:44.240
[Guest]: And that evolution implies that our sources of food will be exploited by other organisms,

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.240
[Guest]: by bugs, by fungus.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:53.600
[Guest]: And so the creation of wealth always requires a struggle left to itself, the natural state

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.840
[Amit Varma]: of humanity is poverty, deprivation and disease.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.560
[Amit Varma]: And from here, you know, even a lot of people who accept that, yes, we are much wealthier,

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.280
[Amit Varma]: however you measure this, often argue that there's greater and greater inequality.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:12.200
[Amit Varma]: And you know, whenever I talk about inequality, for example, the hypothetical question I ask

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.560
[Amit Varma]: is in which country would you, in which of these two countries would you rather be poor,

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.500
[Amit Varma]: Bangladesh or USA?

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.440
[Amit Varma]: And of course, people would rather be poor in USA, but the USA has far higher levels

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.440
[Amit Varma]: of inequality.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.240
[Amit Varma]: And you illustrated this with a story about two guys called Boris and Igor.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:35.720
[Guest]: Yes, it's an old story that was told in the Soviet Union of two dirt poor farmers, barely

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.440
[Guest]: able to scratch out a living.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:43.720
[Guest]: The only difference between them is that Igor had a goat, scrawny goat.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.480
[Guest]: One day a fairy godmother appears to Boris, says, I'll grant you one wish.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.360
[Guest]: He said, I wish that Igor's goat should die.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:57.600
[Guest]: That captures the, first of all, the intuition that equality is not inherently a virtue if

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.520
[Guest]: it consists of simply depriving people who have more without benefiting those who have

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.520
[Guest]: less.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:09.880
[Guest]: It also captures the mindset of life under communism in which there was greater desire

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:16.560
[Guest]: to let everyone be equally miserable than that some people are happy or well-fed, even

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.560
[Amit Varma]: if not everyone is.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.200
[Amit Varma]: We'll take a quick commercial break.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.200
[Amit Varma]: We'll come back in just a minute.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.640
[Unknown]: Hello, hello, hello.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.640
[Unknown]: Welcome to another awesome week on the IBM Podcast Network.

[Unknown]: So please do make sure that you do check it out.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.600
[Unknown]: On Cyrus Says, Cyrus, Abbas, and I do a 2018 rewind edition of Cock and Bull, the year's

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.040
[Unknown]: biggest political stories, controversies, sporting triumphs, to viral memes.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.280
[Unknown]: We try and pack it all in an hour.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.000
[Unknown]: I don't think we made it.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.680
[Unknown]: On Advertising is Dead, Varun and Karthik Nagarajan, chief content officer at Wavemaker,

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.080
[Unknown]: recap the year in advertising and give their predictions for 2019.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.320
[Unknown]: On Simplify, tune into part two of their year-end special with special guest Tony Sebastian.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.480
[Unknown]: On Thalle Harate, our Kannada podcast host Pawan Srinath talks about how the internet

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.160
[Unknown]: can be a scary place, as nefarious plots are hashed against companies, governments, and

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.080
[Unknown]: people online all the time.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.160
[Unknown]: On the year-end special awardee wordpecker, Rachel takes a look back at the most popular

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.740
[Unknown]: words of 2018.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.880
[Unknown]: This week on Puliyabazi, Pranay discusses the impact that space research has on an aspirational

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.340
[Unknown]: society and why the argument poor nations shouldn't spend on luxuries like space exploration

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.680
[Unknown]: makes little logical sense.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.000
[Unknown]: And guys, it's been a great 2018 and we hope you enjoyed your journey with IVM.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
[Unknown]: We're looking forward to bigger and better things in 2019.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.520
[Unknown]: Please do tell a friend about the podcast that you've enjoyed, try and spread the word.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.080
[Unknown]: That's very important for us.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.000
[Unknown]: And with that, let's continue on with your show.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.200
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.720
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Steven Pinker.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:46.760
[Amit Varma]: Steven, in your chapter about the environment, which is something that people have great

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:52.960
[Amit Varma]: legitimate worries about, and there's a great quote by Stewart Brand, quote, no product

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.840
[Amit Varma]: of agriculture is the slightest bit natural to an ecologist.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.880
[Amit Varma]: You take a nice complex ecosystem, chop it into rectangles, clear it to the ground and

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.340
[Amit Varma]: hammer it into perpetual early succession.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:08.400
[Amit Varma]: You bust it, sort, flatten it wide and drench it with vast quantities of constant water.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.740
[Amit Varma]: Then you populate it with uniform monochips of profoundly damaged plants incapable of

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.080
[Amit Varma]: living on their own.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:19.260
[Amit Varma]: Every food plant is a pathetic, narrow specialist in one skill inbred for thousands of years

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.640
[Amit Varma]: to a state of genetic idiocy.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.880
[Amit Varma]: These plants are so fragile, they had to domesticate humans just to take endless care of them,

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.880
[Amit Varma]: unquote.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.880
[Amit Varma]: And yet everybody wants organic food, naturally grown food.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:36.120
[Guest]: Yes, and organic food is terrible for the environment because it uses so much more land.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:42.280
[Guest]: That was Stewart Brand, who is kind of a hero to the counterculture and the whole organic,

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:47.200
[Guest]: small movement in the 1970s when he published the famous book The Whole Earth Catalog, often

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:53.720
[Guest]: considered a predecessor of the World Wide Web, although it was on paper, and he changed

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.720
[Guest]: his mind.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.960
[Guest]: He's an environmental activist and in his book Whole Earth Discipline, he helped found

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:04.920
[Guest]: the movement of eco-modernism by arguing that what's best for the environment is density,

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:09.480
[Guest]: is people having less of a footprint on the environment and that includes growing more

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.680
[Guest]: food on less land.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.160
[Amit Varma]: And for those who worry that the environment is getting worse, you also talk about the

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:22.640
[Amit Varma]: environmental Kuznets curve, where things appear to get worse as far as the environment

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:27.600
[Amit Varma]: is concerned, but after a while, when societies get more prosperous and they start caring

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.240
[Amit Varma]: more about the air around them, it gets better again.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.560
[Guest]: That is a general trend.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.720
[Guest]: It doesn't happen by itself as no kind of progress happens by itself, but as countries

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:43.000
[Guest]: do get more developed and richer, they devote more of their resources to protecting the

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.120
[Guest]: environment, to pollution control devices, to laws and enforcing those laws.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.560
[Guest]: And their citizens' values change.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.100
[Guest]: If the main thing you're worried about is getting electricity and you can put up with

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.800
[Guest]: a certain amount of environmental damage, your top priority is cooking your food and

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.640
[Guest]: heating your home and lighting your lights, even to the point that the worst forms of

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.600
[Guest]: pollution are those suffered by poor countries, such as indoor cooking smoke, such as contaminated

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.880
[Guest]: water.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.960
[Guest]: As countries get wealthier, they can devote their attention to the worst kinds of pollution,

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:26.000
[Guest]: namely indoor cooking smoke and contaminated water, but also to the cleanliness of their

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:33.440
[Guest]: harbors and rivers and atmosphere, and they can start enforcing laws to curb pollution.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:40.280
[Guest]: This is certainly obvious to an American visiting Mumbai, as we are now, where looking out the

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:45.000
[Guest]: window we can barely see the skyline of the city just a couple of miles away because of

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.280
[Guest]: the thick smog, which you never see in an American city, although of course American

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:57.240
[Guest]: cities in the 1950s and the 1960s were notorious for their smog, but then because of technology

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:02.360
[Guest]: and laws and regulations, American and European cities have managed to bring the rate of air

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.480
[Amit Varma]: pollution considerably down.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.280
[Amit Varma]: If you think Bombay is bad, you should go to Delhi.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.280
[Guest]: So I've heard.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:13.880
[Amit Varma]: You also talk about how sort of technology, we kind of take technology for granted and

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.840
[Amit Varma]: assume when we are extrapolating for the future that it's going to stay as it is, but we keep

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.840
[Amit Varma]: innovating.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:23.560
[Amit Varma]: Like you point out how throughout history there's been this process of decarbonization.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:28.020
[Amit Varma]: To quote again from your book, quote, the oldest hydrocarbon fuel, dry wood, has a ratio

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:33.040
[Amit Varma]: of combustible carbon atoms to hydrogen atoms of about 10 to 1.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:38.080
[Amit Varma]: The coal which replaced it during the industrial revolution has a ratio of 2 to 1.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.440
[Amit Varma]: A petroleum fuel such as kerosene may have 1 to 2.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:45.200
[Amit Varma]: Natural gas is composed mainly of methane with a ratio of 1 to 4.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:49.600
[Amit Varma]: We are just getting better and better and more and more efficient and part of it is

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:55.540
[Amit Varma]: of course that as the costs of all of those earlier fuels rise, people innovate.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:34:01.480
[Guest]: People innovate and people when they can afford it, they don't want to breathe polluted air

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:07.360
[Guest]: and they figure out ways of getting the energy they need with less pollution if they recognize

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:12.400
[Guest]: that pollution is a problem and if they apply their ingenuity to reducing it.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.880
[Guest]: That could continue with the development of both renewable energy sources like solar and

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:24.400
[Guest]: wind and the development of nuclear power which another heresy of the eco-modernist

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:31.280
[Guest]: movement, many eco-modernists are advocates of nuclear power as the most abundant scalable

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:38.620
[Guest]: form of zero carbon energy even though nuclear has a terrible reputation, actually is extraordinarily

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:44.680
[Guest]: safe compared to coal and oil and gas which kill far more people every single year and

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.680
[Guest]: of course nuclear power does not generate CO2.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:54.680
[Guest]: So it may be that we need within the next couple of decades a whole new generation of

00:34:54.680 --> 00:35:00.720
[Guest]: nuclear technology, so-called fourth generation, small modular reactors that are much less

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:07.360
[Guest]: expensive, much less prone to accidents than existing reactors and it may be that that

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:14.800
[Guest]: technology will be the next leap in the process of decarbonization if we encourage it.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.920
[Amit Varma]: And that also explains why, you know, you make a very convincing case for why nuclear

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:24.040
[Amit Varma]: energy is something that is unnecessarily given a bad rap and you also talk about the

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.160
[Amit Varma]: false binary between environment and development.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.160
[Amit Varma]: One did not come at the cost of the other.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:35.040
[Guest]: Yes, I mean there are some areas in which there is some tension but with technology,

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:40.560
[Guest]: with knowledge, we can apply human ingenuity to figure out how to get more human benefits

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.240
[Guest]: with less environmental damage.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:47.480
[Guest]: It won't happen by itself, it has to be a goal to reduce the environmental damage but

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:53.720
[Guest]: that does tend to become a goal as people satisfy their most basic needs, just feeding

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.520
[Guest]: themselves and their children and getting to work and lighting their homes and they

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.200
[Guest]: do tend to be more concerned about the environment.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:06.640
[Guest]: No one wants to breathe smog and so they encourage measures that do that.

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.160
[Guest]: In rich countries like the United States and Europe, over the last 40 years at the same

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:18.040
[Guest]: time as population has grown, GDP has grown, even number of miles has increased but the

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.640
[Guest]: levels of air pollution and water pollution have decreased.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.360
[Amit Varma]: You know there are a bunch of other chapters where you go through metrics like safety,

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.600
[Amit Varma]: democracy, equal rights, knowledge but since we're running out of time, I'll just skip

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.560
[Amit Varma]: over them, encourage my listeners to sort of just buy the book and read all of them

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:38.240
[Amit Varma]: and go over to the big questions that are kind of safe for the end.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:42.760
[Amit Varma]: Here's one, you know at one point you talk about the post-truth era and I'm quoting from

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.720
[Amit Varma]: you, you say editorialists should retire the new cliché that we are in a post-truth era

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.240
[Amit Varma]: unless they can keep up a tone of scatting irony.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:53.400
[Amit Varma]: The term is corrosive because it implies that we should resign ourselves to propaganda and

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.000
[Amit Varma]: lies and just fight back with more of our own.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.600
[Amit Varma]: We are not in a post-truth era, mendacity, truth shading, conspiracy theories, extraordinary

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:05.440
[Amit Varma]: popular delusions and the madness of crowds are as old as our species and so is the conviction

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.200
[Amit Varma]: that some ideas are right and others are wrong.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:14.440
[Amit Varma]: Where I would kind of say that modern times are possibly different because what social

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:21.080
[Amit Varma]: media does is it pushes us into echo chambers where we are sort of, we find like-minded

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:26.440
[Amit Varma]: people, we confirm our prejudices, we confirm our biases and within those echo chambers

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:31.960
[Amit Varma]: is really no talking to each other, you know we just get stuck in those, is that something

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.280
[Amit Varma]: that kind of worries you?

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:38.960
[Guest]: I mean that does happen although the polarization in the United States was really begun before

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.360
[Unknown]: the advent of social media.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.920
[Guest]: It was begun in large part by cable news channels and even before that there were right-wing

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:51.200
[Guest]: magazines and left-wing magazines and right-wing newspapers and left-wing newspapers and the

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:56.280
[Guest]: thing about the internet is that you're one click away from an opposing viewpoint whereas

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.880
[Guest]: in print media you have to actually go out and buy a newspaper or magazine from the other

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.360
[Guest]: side of the political spectrum.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.880
[Guest]: So even though there has been a trend toward polarization at least in the United States

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:15.240
[Guest]: and Europe, I think it's become a lazy habit to blame everything that goes wrong on social

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.240
[Guest]: media.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:21.040
[Guest]: I think this process began before social media and it may have occurred even without it.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:27.840
[Guest]: I think part of it is driven by the increasing division by education and income where people

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:34.120
[Guest]: are much more likely to live with people who have the same level of education as they do.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:38.840
[Guest]: Neighborhoods have become more segregated by education and education tends to go with

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.280
[Guest]: political opinion or by profession.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:47.840
[Guest]: The business people, the doctors and lawyers and professors, the small business owners,

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:53.400
[Guest]: factory workers tend to live with others of the same type and so some of the residential

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.160
[Guest]: segregation is another factor.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.320
[Guest]: But social media only became popular starting in the late 2000s so we can't blame things

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.320
[Amit Varma]: that have been going on for decades.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.600
[Amit Varma]: Well absolutely but there's a theory that for example the rise of Trump in the USA and

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.080
[Amit Varma]: Modi here is partly exacerbated by that because it led to what you would call preference cascades

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.360
[Amit Varma]: where say in the context of India I often say that people who were closeted bigots would

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.520
[Amit Varma]: do preference falsification where they would not express their feelings in public because

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:23.520
[Amit Varma]: hey it was uncool but suddenly the internet shows them that hey there are a lot of other

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:28.440
[Amit Varma]: closet bigots out there and they feel validated and empowered by that.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:36.200
[Guest]: That is true because even as opinions that used to be taboo are now expressed on social

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:44.360
[Guest]: media overall worldwide in India, in the United States, everywhere the rate of actual bigotry

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.360
[Guest]: has gone down.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:50.680
[Guest]: The rate of sexism, the rate of homophobia but the minority and they still exist who

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:57.640
[Guest]: are bigoted are able to express their views, find people who are of like minds and therefore

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:04.240
[Guest]: have a forum for expressing ideas that used to be taboo even if they are becoming numerically

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.760
[Amit Varma]: less common.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:11.840
[Amit Varma]: When you were earlier asked at the talk you gave at the Times Lit Fest here about populism

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.240
[Amit Varma]: and you said you were optimistic populism would go away and you gave three reasons for

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:20.720
[Amit Varma]: that and those reasons were that one older people tend to be populist and they'll die

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.840
[Amit Varma]: off, two it's a factor of education that the more education you have the less populist

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:31.560
[Amit Varma]: you're likely to be and the third is that the more urbanized you are the less likely

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:35.520
[Amit Varma]: you are to be populist but I'd actually venture to say that all of these might be true in

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.520
[Amit Varma]: the US.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.120
[Amit Varma]: It's the exact opposite in India.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:44.080
[Amit Varma]: You find that the most populism comes from all the engineers, it's rampant in the cities

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and it's probably more widespread among young people than otherwise.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.440
[Guest]: Well it's true in the United States, in Europe and in Britain so I don't know about data

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.440
[Guest]: from India.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.680
[Guest]: So we need to know, it's not a question of whether it's rampant in cities, the question

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.320
[Guest]: is is it more rampant than it is in the more rural areas.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.600
[Amit Varma]: Right fair enough at some point I'll get you data on that.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:11.480
[Amit Varma]: Another interesting thing you sort of talk about is the dangers of tribalism in the academy.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:15.000
[Amit Varma]: You know earlier during this conversation you mentioned how Chris Rock when he cracked

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.360
[Amit Varma]: that joke may not be able to get away with it today with all the political correctness

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.520
[Amit Varma]: and you know we know the dangers of the right, what the populists are doing and so on because

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:28.520
[Amit Varma]: their dangers are you know if they are bigoted they're openly bigoted but what you often

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:34.960
[Amit Varma]: have from some factions of the far left is that there's a lot of sanctimony which hides

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.880
[Amit Varma]: the identity politics that is playing out.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.640
[Guest]: I think that is a problem and in fact the two problems are not independent because many

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:47.960
[Guest]: people who have been attracted to populism list among their top reasons that they are

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.600
[Guest]: sick of political correctness.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:53.080
[Guest]: That was the very first thing that Donald Trump said in the very first debate among

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:59.560
[Guest]: the Republican candidates, he got a huge reaction and it is true that within many mainstream

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:06.200
[Guest]: publications within universities there are certain, there is definitely a shift toward

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:15.000
[Guest]: a political left accompanied by a suppression of hypotheses and opinions that don't conform

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.960
[Guest]: to a certain left wing orthodoxy.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:25.800
[Guest]: Now of the two polls that we're seeing, the movement to the left in academia and the movement

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:30.800
[Guest]: to the right in politics, the movement to the right in politics is much more worrying

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.680
[Guest]: because politicians have power and professors don't.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:42.400
[Guest]: Nonetheless, since they do feed each other, since I know former students, people who write

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.340
[Guest]: to me who are, they're not idiots, they're intelligent, they're educated but they feel

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:55.760
[Guest]: so excluded by the confines of left wing political correctness that they are tempted to join

00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:01.400
[Guest]: the right just because they think that's a place where at least the opinions can be expressed.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:07.800
[Guest]: So I think that to prevent that from happening, academics should be careful to preserve diversity

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:14.280
[Guest]: of political backgrounds, expression of ideas even if they're unpopular, the marketplace

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.280
[Guest]: of ideas.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.280
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:20.480
[Amit Varma]: And in your book you make a very strong case for progress, you believe it will continue

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.520
[Amit Varma]: but you don't think it's inevitable.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.440
[Guest]: What are the threats to humanism?

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:30.160
[Guest]: Certainly the rise of the whole family of movements that we tend to call authoritarian

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.540
[Guest]: populism.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:43.280
[Guest]: These include religious identity, they include ethnic and national chauvinism and jingoism,

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:50.560
[Guest]: include the cynicism toward institutions such as liberal democracy, regulated markets, international

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:55.960
[Guest]: organizations like the UN and treaties and international pacts.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:05.520
[Guest]: The idea that progress comes from charismatic leaders who authentically voice the soul of

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:13.720
[Guest]: the people rather than by rules and laws and fiduciary duties and responsibilities that

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:19.040
[Guest]: are built into the institutions rather than the virtue of the particular people who hold

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.840
[Guest]: those positions of power.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:25.640
[Guest]: We see that in the United States and of course in other countries including India and the

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:31.640
[Guest]: tendency of leaders to try to run around the safeguards written into law simply because

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.240
[Guest]: they are popular, they know the truth, they have the people behind them.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:39.720
[Guest]: That of course is the path toward a dictatorship and disaster.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.880
[Guest]: So all of these trends and they tend to correlate, tends to be some of the same people who believe

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:47.600
[Guest]: all of them are threats to humanism.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:54.680
[Guest]: There's also of course a trend against humanism in more radical forms of Marxism and leftism

00:44:54.680 --> 00:45:01.040
[Guest]: that prioritize the interests of the class above the well-being of individual people

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:04.920
[Guest]: and that tend to encourage demonization of one class by another.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.160
[Amit Varma]: And like you point out, one of the strengths of the Enlightenment is that we think in terms

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.800
[Amit Varma]: of individuals rather than groups and or classes of people.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:18.400
[Guest]: Yeah, very much and not because of some a priori commitment to individualism but simply

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:24.380
[Guest]: because it's individuals who can suffer and flourish and feel pleasure and pain.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:31.800
[Guest]: Only metaphorically can an entire religion or an entire ethnic group flourish or suffer.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.520
[Guest]: It's the individual people who actually feel the pain.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.520
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.920
[Amit Varma]: So I know you're in a hurry so I'm going to end with one last question and I'm going to

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.240
[Amit Varma]: ask you to be a sport on this.

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:45.560
[Amit Varma]: In your book you pointed out that students in Talmudic debates are often asked to argue

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.160
[Amit Varma]: the other side.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.400
[Amit Varma]: So can you tell me briefly why the world is going to hell?

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:56.160
[Guest]: Well it could if we don't deal with the problem of climate change and things could get a lot

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:57.320
[Guest]: worse.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:04.240
[Guest]: If a nuclear war were to break out, even though it's improbable, but it could do such tremendous

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.960
[Guest]: damage that it could cancel out all of the incremental advances.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.880
[Guest]: It's been said that if India and Pakistan had a full-fledged nuclear war that could

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:18.080
[Guest]: send enough debris and soot into the atmosphere to cause a period of cooling that could lead

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:22.560
[Guest]: to mass famine and crop failure.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:29.000
[Guest]: There could be pandemics, there could be cyber terrorism or cyber sabotage, there may be

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:36.240
[Guest]: vulnerabilities of the system that we don't yet understand that could be exploited.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:42.400
[Guest]: And it could be that the future belongs to Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and Viktor

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.680
[Guest]: Orban rather than to the world's liberal Democrats.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:48.680
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for that very bleak vision, you should have called your book Enlightenment

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.680
[Amit Varma]: Never.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.600

[Unknown]: Well, so do we.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:49.720
[Unknown]: But the next best thing?

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.840

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:03.600
[Unknown]: random trivia.

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:08.280
