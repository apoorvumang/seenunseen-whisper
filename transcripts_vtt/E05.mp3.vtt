00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the IBM Podcast Network.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Imagine this.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.800
[Amit Varma]: You are taking a leisurely walk in a quiet neighborhood of Ahmedabad, when suddenly you

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.520
[Amit Varma]: see a queue of people, a long queue that reveals its length as you walk alongside it, it snakes

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.160
[Amit Varma]: around the corner, goes to the end of the next road, turns left, then turns right, then

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.440
[Amit Varma]: left again, then up a flyover, down the flyover, around a Gol Chakkar, and finally it ends

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.360
[Amit Varma]: at a small photo studio.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.960
[Amit Varma]: You go to the head of the queue and ask the first person in the line, hey what's going

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.320
[Amit Varma]: on here, why such a long queue?

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.160
[Amit Varma]: The gentleman looks at you and says, haven't you heard?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.720
[Amit Varma]: This photo studio is offering free passport photographs to everyone, no strings attached.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.400
[Amit Varma]: That is why we have all lined up.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.040
[Amit Varma]: You scratch your chin, you think for a few moments, and then you say wait a minute, there

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.600
[Amit Varma]: must be some catch, this is weird, there is no such thing as a free lunch.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.760
[Amit Varma]: Just then, a lady in the queue offers you a dhokla.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.560
[Amit Varma]: You accept her dhokla gratefully, for you are hungry after this long walk.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.560
[Amit Varma]: The dhokla tastes amazing.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.800
[Amit Varma]: Is there really such a thing as a free lunch?

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.480
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.480
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.680
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.800
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, I am your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.720
[Amit Varma]: In today's episode, I am not going to talk about a specific public policy from a wonks

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.720
[Amit Varma]: point of view.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.760
[Amit Varma]: Instead, I am going to tell you a little story.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.040
[Amit Varma]: A few days ago, I was in Delhi, staying over at my friend Mohit Satyanand's place.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.920
[Amit Varma]: We were drinking tea and talking about this and that, when his office assistant came over

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.880
[Amit Varma]: and handed Mohit a thick bunch of papers.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.000
[Amit Varma]: Mohit leafed through the papers and he sighed.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.360
[Guest]: Then he said to me, this is all because of Rupal Bain.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.360
[Amit Varma]: Mohit, welcome to the show.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.360
[Amit Varma]: Thanks, Amit.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.320
[Amit Varma]: Mohit, so tell me, who is this Rupal Bain and what has she done?

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:21.400
[Guest]: Well, you know, you have to rewind to the 2005-2006 era, when there was this enormous

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.240
[Guest]: flurry of IPOs, initial public offerings, when shares get placed on the market.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.080
[Guest]: And it seemed as though every IPO, when it actually came onto the market, offered a huge

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.640
[Guest]: premium between the price of the IPO and the launch price on the stock exchange.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.360
[Guest]: So it seemed as though all you had to do was get hold of some shares in that allotment

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.360
[Guest]: and you made money.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.440
[Guest]: Now, the catch obviously was that every IPO was oversubscribed, five times, ten times,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.280
[Guest]: fifty times, hundred times.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.880
[Guest]: So it's not as though you could get as much as you wanted at the time of the IPO.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:07.440
[Guest]: Now, you know, the story you told about the snaking line, it reminds me of Soviet Russia.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.640
[Guest]: And one of the things that was wrong with Soviet Russia was bad incentives.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.760
[Guest]: And that's usually the story of every bad economy.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.320
[Guest]: So now the government in its infinite wisdom said that people benefiting from IPOs should

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.360
[Guest]: not just be the rich people.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.200
[Guest]: The small person, you know, that overriding concern for the small person.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200
[Guest]: Like me.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200
[Guest]: Yeah, like you.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.600
[Guest]: Must be benefited as well.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.680
[Guest]: And so for every IPO, they had a separate category for the small investor called the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.680
[Guest]: retail investor.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.640
[Guest]: And I think at that point in time, the retail investor was defined as somebody who put less

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:55.000
[Guest]: than one lakh application because the number of retail investors was always fairly small

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.480
[Guest]: in comparison to the people who had money and wanted to go into it.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.860
[Guest]: So chances of getting allotment in the retail were much higher.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.960
[Guest]: So what Rupal Ben Panchal did was that in the Yes Bank IPO, it was later detected that

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:23.360
[Guest]: she had fielded, I have the figure here somewhere, 6,515 applications under the retail segment.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:33.520
[Guest]: And out of that, 6,221 had the same address, 402 to 403 Shashwat building opposite Gujarat

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.960
[Guest]: College Ahmedabad.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.960
[Guest]: Okay.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.840
[Guest]: Now, obviously this could only be done in collusion with a bank.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.160
[Guest]: So bank was obviously involved.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.080
[Guest]: The bank which opened the bank account, which allowed them to pay the money, which allowed

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.560
[Guest]: them to open a DMAT account.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.960
[Guest]: But there was one issue, which is that the forms had to be complete and the forms required

00:04:51.960 --> 00:05:01.000
[Guest]: a photograph, how do you produce 6,515 photographs, enter the free passport photograph?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.520
[Amit Varma]: Tell me more about this.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.520
[Guest]: Well, that's the answer.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.960
[Guest]: So everyone who went in got that two free passport photographs, but Rupal Ben Panchal

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.760
[Guest]: and her husband and their cabal also kept copies of that photographs, put them on to

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.200
[Guest]: the application, had any kind of arbitrary signature, but at least, you know, this concept

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.640
[Guest]: we have of Khanapuri, means you tick the boxes, the bank had ticked all the boxes.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.920
[Guest]: There was an address.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.000
[Guest]: In those days, you didn't require PAN card for any application under 50,000 rupees.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.680
[Guest]: So PAN card was not required, you had a photograph, you had an address, the bank manager ticked

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.980
[Guest]: all the boxes and you made this application.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.720
[Guest]: So this is what they did and though it came to light in the Yes Bank application, in the

00:05:50.720 --> 00:06:00.240
[Guest]: Yes Bank IPO case, as the investigation proceeded, they discovered that this cabal had applied

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.120
[Guest]: in 21 IPOs.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.160
[Guest]: And in one of those IPOs, it's not clear whether, you know, there was a fixed number of operators,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.840
[Guest]: but there were a lot of common elements.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.000
[Guest]: In one particular application, there were 21,000 forms, which were filled up by this

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
[Guest]: ring.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
[Amit Varma]: That is a lot of passport photographs.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.680
[Guest]: That's a lot of passport photographs and hence you're probably right, that line really sneaked

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.080
[Guest]: through all around the path.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.360
[Amit Varma]: So what happened as a consequence of her getting caught?

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.400
[Amit Varma]: Why does Rupal Ban bother you so much today?

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.920
[Guest]: She bothers me for two reasons.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.560
[Guest]: She bothers me for two reasons because now what has happened is that as you started the

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.920
[Guest]: story is that compliance issues have gone up.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:52.160
[Guest]: And this is a larger phenomenon that I face as a businessman and even as an honest tax

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.240
[Guest]: paying citizen, which is that compliance issues have gone up massively.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:03.960
[Guest]: It takes me an enormous amount of time to comply with issues relating to know your customer,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:11.400
[Guest]: with issues relating to filing my tax returns, my tax returns then have to get audited, etc.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.520
[Guest]: etc.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:19.920
[Guest]: The effort that goes into opening a new bank account, this impacts everybody, it's just

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920
[Amit Varma]: me.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.440
[Amit Varma]: It's a huge opportunity cost and the amount of time that people spend doing this, it could

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.440
[Amit Varma]: be doing something else which is productive for the economy.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:34.360
[Guest]: The other reason that it bothers me is that our economic history is littered with bad

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.240
[Guest]: incentives.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.240
[Guest]: You take another area that I'm familiar with, which is the grain trade.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.980
[Guest]: So you have a public distribution system.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.620
[Guest]: What the public distribution system essentially does is to create differential pricing.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.360
[Guest]: So you create one price for the supposedly poor person, another price for the supposedly

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.360
[Guest]: rich person.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.440
[Guest]: So you have the BPL and you have the APL and then you have the market price and then more

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.080
[Guest]: recently another price was introduced, which was the Antyoday price, which is like, you

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.040
[Guest]: know, to end poverty and end hunger.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.280
[Guest]: So I have four prices prevailing in the market.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:13.600
[Guest]: You're creating an opportunity for arbitrage and systems will milk that arbitrage.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:20.400
[Guest]: And what you do by creating these concessions, which is again coming from this great concern

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:28.240
[Guest]: with the underdog, what you do is actually you corrupt the entire system.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:35.080
[Guest]: You create an entire class of people whose only contribution to the economy is to bridge

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.080
[Guest]: that arbitrage.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.160
[Guest]: Now this we know, this is what efficient economies do.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.000
[Guest]: But as a result, you have created corruption from top to bottom.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.880
[Guest]: You've created FCI managers who send the trucks directly from FCI depots to grain traders.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.360
[Guest]: You have created truck drivers who are part of this whole system.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:01.120
[Guest]: You've created mill owners who function entirely on BDS stock.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:11.680
[Guest]: You've created BDS shops, which have a wheat milling installation next door so they can

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.680
[Guest]: move.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:18.080
[Guest]: You've created, you've perpetuated a corrupt way of looking at the world by creating all

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.240
[Guest]: these ridiculous incentives.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:27.600
[Guest]: Every sector you look at, there is this desire to tinker with the economy for some holier-than-thou

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.600
[Guest]: motive.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.040
[Guest]: But all you do is create incentives for short circuits for the Rupal Panchayats of the world.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.200
[Guest]: So more than the compliance and the fact that I had to sign a few extra forms, what bothers

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.480
[Guest]: me is that we don't seem to learn.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.960
[Guest]: We don't seem to learn that when you create an opportunity for arbitrage, that opportunity

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.320
[Guest]: is going to get milked and you're going to create more and more corrupt people.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.960
[Amit Varma]: And also when you create incentives for dishonesty, that eventually percolates down to the culture.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960
[Guest]: That's what I'm talking about.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.400
[Guest]: That's what really bothers me, that we have a culture of corruption and that culture of

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.200
[Guest]: corruption is not because we are inherently corrupt people or there's something wrong

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.240
[Guest]: with the Hindu gene.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:17.680
[Guest]: It's because for 70 years, you have always tried to set prices and set artificial prices.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.400
[Guest]: Don't allow flexibility into the system, create two categories of economic players or three

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.720
[Amit Varma]: or four or five, you're going to end up with this.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:31.000
[Amit Varma]: So finally, if you had the story of Rupal Ban in a fourth standard textbook and fourth

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.320
[Amit Varma]: standard kids always want a moral at the end of the story, what's the moral of the story?

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:43.880
[Guest]: The moral of the story should be eye pencil, which is that goods get created when and they

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:49.520
[Guest]: get created efficiently and they get created with uniform and very elastic prices when

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.960
[Amit Varma]: you allow economic actors to play.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.200
[Amit Varma]: Mohit, thank you so much for being on the show.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:04.240
[Unknown]: My pleasure.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.920
[Unknown]: Next week on The Seen and the Unseen, Amit Varma will be talking to Pranay Kodasane about

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.680
[Unknown]: the surgical strikes conducted by the government last year in September.
