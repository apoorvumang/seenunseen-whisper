00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160
[Amit Varma]: All of us have heard stories of partition. Families torn apart, loved ones killed, women

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.960
[Amit Varma]: raped, lives destroyed, trains arriving in stations filled with dead bodies. Victims

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.800
[Amit Varma]: of slaughter not just of humans, but humanity. I've heard these stories all my life, but

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.000
[Amit Varma]: they seem distant and far away, as if they were from an old novel, or even when they

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.720
[Amit Varma]: were real, as if they were from a black and white picture book and not really real. We

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.480
[Amit Varma]: all know that in our lives, we will face personal grief. People we love will die, and then we

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.480
[Amit Varma]: will die. But we have always assumed or at least hoped that as a nation, we would not

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.120
[Amit Varma]: encounter collective grief again. Well, here we are. This time the details are different.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.180
[Amit Varma]: We don't yet know how many have died in India because of COVID-19 and how many will die.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.520
[Amit Varma]: What we do know is that the suffering this time is far more widespread than at any other

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.280
[Amit Varma]: time in our history. It has touched every corner of this country I love. Every morning

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.440
[Amit Varma]: these days, I spend half an hour after I wake up just writing condolence messages. I'm so

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.160
[Amit Varma]: sorry for your loss. Take care, get better soon. In places like Delhi, every single friend

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.680
[Amit Varma]: I have is affected. And I believe it is worse in our heartlands, where the hospitals cannot

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.960
[Amit Varma]: run out of oxygen, because there are no hospitals, where people get ill, and then they die. And

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.440
[Amit Varma]: there is no cause of death noted down, no accounting to be made. A few days ago, my

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.720
[Amit Varma]: father also died. The municipality didn't allow us near his body, understandably so,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.320
[Amit Varma]: or inside the crematorium. We watched from a distance until one man came and pointed

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.840
[Amit Varma]: to the smoke coming from a distant tower. That was the last I saw of my father. I remember

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.080
[Amit Varma]: looking at the apartment complex 100 meters away, and wondered what it would be like to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.240
[Amit Varma]: live in an apartment facing that tower. All day, you could look outside the window and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.880
[Amit Varma]: see lives go up in smoke. Well, we are all living in that apartment. And whether you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.940
[Amit Varma]: look outside or you look within, this is what you will see. Life's gone up in smoke in this

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.680
[Amit Varma]: great country of ours in this 21st century.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.840
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:18.360
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.360
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My guest today is a brilliant economist, Ajay Shah.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.920
[Amit Varma]: We discuss the economics and politics of vaccines. Both of us believe that our government made

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.960
[Amit Varma]: a tragic error in not getting vaccines out there on a war footing. It spent too much

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.760
[Amit Varma]: time. It was hobbled by the ideologies of central planning and Atma Nirbharta, and it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.240
[Amit Varma]: still hasn't learned all the lessons it should have. Ajay helps me get to the heart of the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.080
[Amit Varma]: matter. And I understand the subject much better after this conversation. How could

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.940
[Amit Varma]: we have vaccinated more people? Who should have made these vaccines? How should they

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.400
[Amit Varma]: have been distributed? How should we have arrived at a price? We discuss all this in

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.280
[Amit Varma]: today's episode, though we spend the first half of it talking about Indian healthcare.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.320
[Amit Varma]: Our healthcare system has been broken for decades. It was always going to collapse in

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.920
[Amit Varma]: the face of a challenge like COVID-19. That is why some of us were so terrified in March

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.160
[Amit Varma]: last year. We worried about the sort of scenes that we are seeing today in Delhi and elsewhere.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.540
[Amit Varma]: We were lucky in April 2020 for a number of reasons to escape that fate. But we should

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.000
[Amit Varma]: have used that time to prepare. And we did not. Well, let's look ahead. What can we do

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.680
[Amit Varma]: now? Healthcare is perhaps the hardest problem to solve in India. So there are no easy answers.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.200
[Amit Varma]: But we do need to try and understand the nature of this problem. In his usual lucid style,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.000
[Amit Varma]: Ajay gave me many insights in this conversation. But before we get to that, let's take a quick

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.520
[Amit Varma]: commercial break. Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.280
[Amit Varma]: many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.680
[Amit Varma]: 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.840
[Amit Varma]: me and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.240
[Amit Varma]: was forced to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.320
[Amit Varma]: Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.360
[Amit Varma]: Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.720
[Amit Varma]: at indiancut.substack.com where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.620
[Amit Varma]: I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else. So please

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.560
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.880
[Amit Varma]: Ajay, welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.960
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for having me here.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, the last time we spoke was in Feb. In fact, I, you know, I was while setting

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.920
[Amit Varma]: the session up, I realized that we recorded on 4th Feb, where we spoke about the farm

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.000
[Amit Varma]: bills, which by the way, is one of my top 10 downloaded episodes already. I think it's

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.320
[Amit Varma]: moved up to number eight, as of now, a combination both of the urgency of the subject and I would

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.480
[Amit Varma]: say the lucidity of your explanations. But interestingly, in that episode, for the first

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.480
[Amit Varma]: half, we kind of actually spoke about your new interest in public health and healthcare

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.080
[Amit Varma]: and so on, especially in a COVID context. And sadly, the time has kind of come to go

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.600
[Amit Varma]: a little deeper into that because of everything that is happening. But before we do that,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.240
[Amit Varma]: tell me a little bit about the recent weeks for you. Where are you? Have you been well?

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.800
[Amit Varma]: What's it been like in general?

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.600
[Guest]: Mercifully, I've been well, my people have been well. But for the rest, like everybody

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:55.960
[Guest]: else, this is just a nightmare. We keep hearing of friends and friends of friends, person

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:04.740
[Guest]: x reaches out to person y help find me oxygen help find me an ICU bed. It is a relentless

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.840
[Guest]: assault on the soul. You just get exhausted. You just keep wondering and praying. Is there

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.280
[Guest]: something we could do different?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, there's a new term for this now called doom scrolling, where you just

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.080
[Amit Varma]: kind of go on Twitter and you're doom scrolling. You're just it's horrendous. I've never seen

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.520
[Amit Varma]: anything like this. And I think, you know, the collective trauma that we're going through

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.640
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, in one sense, even greater than partition because it's spread out everywhere

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:37.040
[Amit Varma]: throughout the country. Like, I'm sure every home in this country knows someone who has

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.320
[Amit Varma]: suffered or died and so on. And especially when I talk to my friends in Delhi, like everybody

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.320
[Amit Varma]: has, you know, is going through shit right now.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:53.400
[Guest]: I have experienced a very peculiar conflict in my head. And I'm sure you will understand

00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:01.240
[Guest]: it in a flash. And let me just say it. So I'm reminded of the British side in World

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.840
[Guest]: War Two, where the binding constraint was the number of pilots. You could do everything

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.400
[Guest]: else. You can build planes in a hurry. You can do all kinds of things in a hurry, but

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.000
[Guest]: you can't create a good pilot in a hurry. So that's my intuition about thinking about

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.240
[Guest]: the health care system. We are where we are. You have a certain amount of doctors, you

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.160
[Guest]: have a certain amount of nurses. They're working flat out 18 hours a day. And in the short

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.600
[Guest]: run, their supply elasticity is zero. There is nothing you can do to augment the skilled

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.920
[Guest]: staff inside the health care facilities. You can do a little bit more quickly in terms

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.200
[Guest]: of putting up some ICU beds and some little more oxygen therapy. But fundamentally, in

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.480
[Guest]: the short term, it is impossible to change the number of health care workers. In that

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:57.720
[Guest]: case, as a society, as a system, it's curtains. There's 100 beds of capacity. And if there

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:05.280
[Guest]: are 200 people who require that capacity, then there's just the horrendous choice of

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:11.280
[Guest]: triaging and choosing which 100 are going to get in. And each of us would love to have

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.640
[Guest]: our friends and family access those beds. But in system thinking, that's no answer because

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.120
[Guest]: any one person that gets in is coming at the expense of somebody else. And how do you make

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.640
[Guest]: those moral choices? Similarly, as an economist, it has always been apparent to me that if

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:33.680
[Guest]: you put more money into the problem right now, all that happens is that the demand curve

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.760
[Guest]: intersects with the rigid supply curve at a higher price. All you do with a little more

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.160
[Guest]: money buying health care services at a time like this is driving up the price. You don't

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.400
[Guest]: change the brute reality, which is that there are 200 people demanding a capacity of 100.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.280
[Guest]: And in the short term, that capacity cannot be changed.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.240
[Amit Varma]: A few strands. I mean, one, of course, when you speak of the moral choices we have to

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.920
[Amit Varma]: make, some of these choices come down totally to privilege and power. For example, there

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.480
[Amit Varma]: was this heartbreaking video of this person who'd got an oxygen cylinder for his father

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.520
[Amit Varma]: or uncle or whatever, who obviously needed it badly and was going to die. And the cops

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.400
[Amit Varma]: came and they confiscated it from him because they wanted to take it for a VIP, which just

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.520
[Amit Varma]: kind of tells you the colonial mindset of the state. And you know, one of the really

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.920
[Amit Varma]: heartening things about the last couple of weeks also has another side to it. It's like

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.080
[Amit Varma]: the scene and the unseen, which is, you know, on the one hand, it's heartening that everyone

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.280
[Amit Varma]: who's reached out on Twitter has just got so much help from people like just now before,

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, this recording began. And this is like 2pm on April 29. And just before this

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.360
[Amit Varma]: recording began, I saw this tweet from my good friend, Joy Bhattacharya, who said that

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.360
[Amit Varma]: he knows of at least 12 people who have been helped by reaching out on Twitter, which is

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.240
[Amit Varma]: great. But the unseen side of that is that there are 12 other people who didn't get that

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.600
[Amit Varma]: help. Because everything is limited. There is an opportunity cost even for that. And

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.000
[Amit Varma]: sure, you know, we kind of have the privilege even anyone who can use Twitter and reach

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.560
[Amit Varma]: out like that and get amplified also has a certain amount of privilege. And I'm happy

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.560
[Amit Varma]: for everyone who's, you know, managed to get help and all of that in these difficult times.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.400
[Amit Varma]: But the brute reality is that if there are 200 beds and 500 people who need them, 300

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.000
[Amit Varma]: people are just gone. I mean, it's a pretty horrible situation. And last year in March,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.240
[Amit Varma]: I remember, you know, I recorded an episode on COVID, the first of my many episodes on

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.840
[Amit Varma]: COVID in general, and my guest in that one was Shruti Rajgopalan. And before we recorded

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.920
[Amit Varma]: that episode, you know, as far back as March last year, she was telling me about what could

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.440
[Amit Varma]: happen to the healthcare system in India. And from her experiences of her friends in

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.200
[Amit Varma]: Italy, where she had lived and all, Bergamo and so on. And it didn't happen. And I thought,

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.040
[Amit Varma]: okay, great, we got lucky, you know, whether it was lockdown or a combination of other

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.320
[Amit Varma]: factors that people have speculated on, we got lucky it didn't happen. And it's happened

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.960
[Amit Varma]: now. And it's happened a year later. And you kind of realize,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:00.160
[Guest]: So I think we always knew that the Indian healthcare system doesn't work so well. And

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.360
[Guest]: the capacity in the healthcare system is minuscule. So, you know, in my mind's eye, this was always

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:15.760
[Guest]: on my mind. I remember, back in February and March 2020, I was writing the first paper

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.760
[Guest]: on this subject that I happened to work on. I've written many, many things on the subject.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:27.200
[Guest]: But my first writing was in February and March, I was writing a paper on the subject. And

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:34.120
[Guest]: my co author and I were kind of playing this out in our mind's eye. And it was just chilling,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.560
[Guest]: because you do the arithmetic, you know, you just multiply through by some plausible hospitalization

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:46.640
[Guest]: rates by some plausible fatality rates, multiplied by the Indian age structure of the population.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.240
[Amit Varma]: And what you get is quite a disaster.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.200
[Amit Varma]: One of the things that this pandemic has sort of done for us, and I've written a column

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.480
[Amit Varma]: on this last year as well, is that it's laid bare a greater ongoing disaster, which is

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.840
[Amit Varma]: our dysfunctional flailing state, right? And one subset of that, and not even a subset

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.960
[Amit Varma]: of that, there's a small overlap. But another thing that is laid bare is obviously how,

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:14.440
[Amit Varma]: what a bad state our healthcare is in. Now, you pointed out about how our healthcare workers

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.840
[Amit Varma]: are limited, there are only so many doctors, and there are only so many nurses. And what

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.560
[Amit Varma]: they are doing is just incredibly heroic. Most of them going well beyond the call of

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.600
[Amit Varma]: duty and the kind of risks they take and the kind of service they're putting in, but they're

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.400
[Amit Varma]: limited. Give me a sense now, that if you look at it outside the context of the pandemic,

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, how can we quantify the shortcomings in our healthcare system, especially in something

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.060
[Amit Varma]: like this? Like, are there figures that you know, in a developed country, there would

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:47.160
[Amit Varma]: be so many doctors plus 1000 people in the population, so many nurses or whatever? Are

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:53.000
[Amit Varma]: there quantifiable ways to think about how in terms of healthcare we are so far behind?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.040
[Guest]: Here, I'm afraid I'm going to go all economist on you. So this is about money. This is about

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:05.080
[Guest]: affluence. It's about how much you're willing to spend. So it turns on the ratio between

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:10.280
[Guest]: the income of a doctor and the income of the general population. Okay, so if you live in

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.920
[Guest]: a country where your income is good vis-a-vis a doctor's income, then you're going to fare

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.560
[Guest]: relatively well, because using your income, you're going to be able to buy many man hours

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:24.600
[Guest]: of a doctor's time, and vice versa. So now the large mass of the Indian population has

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:32.680
[Guest]: an income, where, frankly, meaningful levels of training in the doctor are unaffordable.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.560
[Guest]: So I classify that as a poverty problem. I classify that as an underdevelopment problem,

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:44.360
[Guest]: that it is just baked in. It is inevitable that when we're a poor country, and because

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:50.000
[Guest]: building a doctor is like building an RAF pilot is something that takes thousands of

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.880
[Guest]: hours of training, it's a considerable investment. And it's not possible to make a particularly

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:01.720
[Guest]: cheap doctor. We can try. We need to improve processes and bring down the cost of healthcare.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:08.560
[Guest]: We need more telemedicine. We need more AI-based diagnosis systems backed by just a nurse.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.760
[Guest]: They are all great directions to go in. But the brute fact is that there is a poverty

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.760
[Guest]: problem. So I think those, the metrics that you refer to are a bit dangerous, because

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.360
[Guest]: we slip into a first world way of thinking. And that's not a fair comparison against where

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.720
[Guest]: we are in India today. So in India today, we should be asking the question that at Indian

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.920
[Guest]: levels of income, what can you do different? And in my opinion, we need to do a revolution

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:39.600
[Guest]: in AI plus nurse rather than a doctor, because for the foreseeable future, there's not going

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.160
[Guest]: to be a doctor. We need to do much more with telemedicine. And again, the telemedicine

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.640
[Guest]: can be some hybrid of a doctor or an AI at the other end. It doesn't even have to be

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:55.120
[Guest]: a human being all the time. And then we turn to healthcare system design. And this turns

00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:02.160
[Guest]: on problems like what's the nature of the market failure in healthcare? And the market

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:09.400
[Guest]: failure of healthcare is basically a crisis of asymmetric information. When you are faced

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:14.280
[Guest]: with a hospital and the hospital says that your mother needs a ventilator, and if you

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.760
[Guest]: don't sign on this piece of paper right now, she's going to die. What are you going to

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:26.520
[Guest]: do? So there is extreme mis-selling by private healthcare providers. And the question is,

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:31.520
[Guest]: how do we reorganize healthcare so as to address that market failure and produce better behavior

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.320
[Guest]: out of private providers? And then somewhere in this, the least important element of the

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:43.800
[Guest]: Indian healthcare system is there is one large PSU who's called the government. So the government

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:50.800
[Guest]: is not thinking health policy. The government is thinking I'm one big PSU. So there is many,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.520
[Guest]: many government hospitals. There are many, many government departments of health, and

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.880
[Guest]: they seem to concentrate on being a PSU. So think of an old department of telecom, which

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.120
[Guest]: was thinking that they are in the telephony business. That's the Indian health establishment.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.880
[Guest]: And this is part of the story about why we do so badly on health policy, because the

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.880
[Guest]: DNA of the Indian health policy community is to look at the world from the worldview

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:24.620
[Guest]: of a healthcare PSU. And they are not used to worrying about their own operational capabilities

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.480
[Guest]: and efficiency. And they are used to just always asking for more money. So their answer

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.160
[Guest]: is always more money. If you speak to any conventional health expert in India, the story

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.000
[Guest]: is give me more money. And that's not a very useful way to approach it. Because neither

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.600
[Guest]: does the healthcare PSU work too well, nor does the private sector healthcare work too

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:49.480
[Guest]: well. So, you know, we are caught between two bad things that are happening in the country.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:55.040
[Guest]: And that's the essence of what is wrong with Indian healthcare today. The puzzle, the thinking

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.600
[Guest]: challenge, the research challenge is how to understand this landscape, how to create the

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:06.000
[Guest]: data sets that will support the research on this landscape, and how to find our way out

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
[Guest]: of this problem. And I don't pretend to have the answers. But I am at this level of knowledge

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.080
[Guest]: that I am able to succinctly pose the questions.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.440
[Amit Varma]: Fascinating, because I was going to take a couple of strands and ask you for potential

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.560
[Amit Varma]: answers for that. And I'm going to try and do that anyway. And one of those strands is

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.680
[Amit Varma]: this that just as Indians understand that there is no rule of law effectively in this

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.040
[Amit Varma]: country for most people, unless you're incredibly privileged. You know, people have Jugaadu

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.320
[Amit Varma]: ways of getting by their social trust, and all of those things come into play. Similarly,

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.160
[Amit Varma]: there isn't really a healthcare system, a functional healthcare system in the sense

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.160
[Amit Varma]: that most individuals in this country are one medical emergency away from just going

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.960
[Amit Varma]: broke. You know, that's just a fact of the matter. You know, I've written about, you

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.320
[Amit Varma]: know, so many other problems India's face, but this is one field where I haven't quite

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.600
[Amit Varma]: gotten and handled on the structural problems. For example, we can look at something like

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.440
[Amit Varma]: education and say that, okay, here's a structural problem, the incentives for the state are

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:08.160
[Amit Varma]: bad in terms of provision, and it should just allow far more private provision and just

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:13.240
[Amit Varma]: let society solve its own problems while simultaneously trying to beef up state capacity and do what

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.880
[Amit Varma]: it's doing. Similarly, you know, we've discussed the problems of agriculture in our last episode,

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.160
[Amit Varma]: and I've, you know, gone deeper into it in previous episodes before that. But what is

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.000
[Amit Varma]: the problem with healthcare? Because in the eyes of the common man, you're just in denial

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.080
[Amit Varma]: that you're ever going to fall ill. You know, just as we have an illusion of immortality,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.920
[Amit Varma]: which keeps us away from thinking about the fact that we have a limited time span, although

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:41.160
[Amit Varma]: sadly in the last few days, I think many more people have had occasion to ponder on that.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.360
[Amit Varma]: But just as we have that illusion of immortality, and we live as you're going to live forever,

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.040
[Amit Varma]: we also have this illusion of good health. And we are in denial of the fact that someday

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.200
[Amit Varma]: we will require medical help. And the impression most people will have of say, private medical

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.960
[Amit Varma]: health in India is that it's almost like a scam, almost like a racket. I think Rana Das

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.040
[Amit Varma]: Gupta wrote a book about this a few years ago about the situation in Delhi that you

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.560
[Amit Varma]: go to any of these big hospitals, and they'll give you hazard tests, which you don't require,

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:12.440
[Amit Varma]: and they'll completely fleece you. And their incentives are tailored towards doing that

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.440
[Amit Varma]: doctors incentives are tailored towards prescribing more and more tests. So the hospital makes

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.640
[Amit Varma]: money and blah, blah, blah, and everything seems kind of broken. And of course, the public

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:27.640
[Amit Varma]: healthcare in India is the worst. So the answer is, isn't even that. So structurally, what

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.800
[Amit Varma]: are the problems that they are and given the poverty, you know, are they solvable? Or do

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.760
[Guest]: we need to solve for poverty first?

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:41.560
[Guest]: So again, I will go all economist on you that whatever x rupees are being spent, the puzzle

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.000
[Guest]: is on how to get the most bang for the buck. Okay, so I just treat the poverty problem

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.960
[Guest]: as given, okay, one day, we're gonna get rich, and that'll get better. So it is incredibly

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:56.680
[Guest]: important to push for broad GDP growth is the greatest weapon to solve all these problems.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:03.280
[Guest]: But right now, let's stick to an allocative problem. I have a funny story. The year was

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:10.560
[Guest]: 2004. I was sitting with my dear friends, Jeff Hammer and Lance Pritchett. At the time,

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:16.560
[Guest]: my mind used to be filled with macroeconomics and finance. And we were doing a furious conversation

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.000
[Guest]: around some of old things, some of those things. And at some point, both of them stopped and

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.160
[Guest]: said, you know, Ajay, you're a very smart guy. You think you're thinking a lot about

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.680
[Guest]: macro and finance. But you know what, when you grow up, you're going to have to do health.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:36.200
[Guest]: And I was like, huh. And they said, everything that you're doing is trivial. And the really

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:42.920
[Guest]: hard problem is health, that actually, you know, fixing monetary policy, doing an inflation

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.680
[Guest]: targeting system with the Monetary Policy Committee and narrow down the function of

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.680
[Guest]: the central bank.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.000
[Guest]: It's kind of obvious, and it's really not hard. There's just some pesky political problems

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.840
[Guest]: you have to solve. But it's not really hard. It's kind of trivial. Similarly, you want

00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.560
[Guest]: to do international trade. Frankly, you know, at the end of the tunnel, there's basically

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.760
[Guest]: only one thing to do, which is remove all trade barriers. Okay, you can do it in an

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.480
[Guest]: obfuscated way, you can do it in a complicated way, but there's really nothing hard there,

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:16.640
[Guest]: and so on. Whereas, the truly difficult thing is health. Why? In my opinion, the pieces

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.640
[Guest]: of it are as follows.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.640
[Guest]: The first is that there is such a profound amount of asymmetric information. You and

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.240
[Guest]: I really don't know what the doctor does. You and I really don't know the marginal contribution

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:33.040
[Guest]: of a doctor. To kind of make an education analogy, in education, we like to think that

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:39.360
[Guest]: we'll pay for test results. But there is the ever-present problem that some part of the

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.960
[Guest]: test results are baked in because of the child at home and family. And some of the test results

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.120
[Guest]: are the contribution of the teacher. So, for example, a school running in a slum will always

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:54.120
[Guest]: generate low test scores. And if we think we're going to pay something proportional

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:59.520
[Guest]: to the test scores, then we're doing something very unfair. So, it's very hard to disentangle

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:06.000
[Guest]: the contribution of the healthcare. You and I, as individual customers, are not very wise

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:14.360
[Guest]: in how we think of our healthcare providers. Too many of us go to quacks. We endlessly

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:20.440
[Guest]: submit to all kinds of nonsense where there is some alternative therapy or the other,

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.040
[Guest]: and we tend to take it more seriously than we should. Or we tend to care about a bedside

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:30.600
[Guest]: manner. We tend to think that a doctor who speaks nicely to me is a nice doctor. We tend

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.400
[Guest]: to think that a doctor who speaks in English knows more than a doctor who does not speak

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.840
[Guest]: in English, and so on. There is a hundred cognitive biases that are in play. And we

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:44.160
[Guest]: are all very smug, and we've persuaded ourselves that we understand this stuff, whereas actually

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:49.080
[Guest]: we don't. And that creates all the wrong incentives. So, hospitals have incentives to look like

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:54.920
[Guest]: five-star hotels, but that's not essential to the business of being a hospital. To be

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:59.320
[Guest]: a good hospital, you need to be clean, but you don't need to be like a five-star hotel.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:05.880
[Guest]: Whereas the modern Indian healthcare industry is really building some expensive infrastructure

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:11.160
[Guest]: and loaning it out, renting it out to one doctor or one specialist after another. And

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:17.120
[Guest]: customers are just going by the glitz in the brand name and the marble foyer rather than

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:22.400
[Guest]: the substantive content of the knowledge and the value add of the healthcare. There are

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.440
[Guest]: important regional differences in some of these problems. So, some of my friends have

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.440
[Guest]: invested in many healthcare companies. They have purchased and successfully built and

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:38.960
[Guest]: exited many healthcare companies. And I remember one of the partners said to me that he has

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.600
[Guest]: never felt comfortable about buying a healthcare establishment in North India, because he felt

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.200
[Guest]: there is a pervasive ethical collapse in North India of the kind that you don't see in the

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.000
[Guest]: other parts of the country. So, in the West and the South, there is still a little more

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.320
[Guest]: of the ideal of a doctor as a service provider, of a doctor as a good person that is going

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.800
[Guest]: to take care of you. Whereas in North India, there seems to be a bigger collapse into just

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:12.520
[Guest]: craven commercial considerations, where a doctor misprescribes drugs and tests and gets

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.400
[Guest]: a kickback. Amusingly enough, I want to say that in the field of finance, we've gone after

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:24.080
[Guest]: kickbacks. We do more with mutual funds and insurance companies in blocking the kickbacks

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:31.240
[Guest]: from a manufacturer to the sales agent. Whereas in the field of medicine, we do nothing. We

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:37.320
[Guest]: do absolutely nothing today in blocking these kickbacks. And I consider these kickbacks

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.960
[Guest]: highly unethical, but they are the norm and not the exception.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.800
[Guest]: Another anecdote, one of my colleagues in Delhi was experiencing a certain class of

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:54.040
[Guest]: concerns and she spoke with a person in Bombay on this question, who was a doctor. And the

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.320
[Guest]: feedback I got was that she should buy a ticket and come to Bombay and do this entire thing

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.920
[Guest]: in Bombay. They don't do it in Delhi because the healthcare establishment in Delhi is so

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.680
[Guest]: bad, it's so dangerous. Do your work in Bombay. There's more decency, there's more ethics,

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:13.200
[Guest]: there's more fair play in Bombay. Last anecdote, if I had a horrendous life-threatening situation,

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.280
[Guest]: what would I like to do? I'd like to buy a ticket and go to Christian Medical College,

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.640
[Guest]: Vellore. This is an old-fashioned place where doctors are paid a fixed salary and there

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:26.200
[Guest]: are no kickbacks. And in my opinion, it's the best healthcare in India.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:33.520
[Guest]: So the profound asymmetry between the healthcare provider and the customer really poses a difficult

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:39.200
[Guest]: challenge for market-based thinking. And we in India are in some peculiar place where

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:44.840
[Guest]: there are some noble establishments like Christian Medical College, Vellore. There are some parts

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.560
[Guest]: of the country and there are some organizations who care more about the well-being of patients

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.560
[Guest]: and seem to do a better job. And then there is most of India, which is in a wasteland

00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:00.800
[Guest]: of kickbacks and all the wrong incentives for doctors. Somewhere in this, we have to

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:09.560
[Guest]: bring in the distinction between the medicalization of healthcare and the problem of wellness.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.160
[Guest]: If you pause to think about it, I think we spoke about it last time in the farm bills

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.720
[Guest]: thing, prevention is a thousand times better than cure. And you just come back at this

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:25.160
[Guest]: over and over and over. All of us should be prioritizing wellness a thousand times more

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:31.880
[Guest]: than we do with the healthcare. And in wellness, I would always go beyond the physical body

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:38.200
[Guest]: to the mind for two reasons. First is that because a healthy mind fosters a healthy body.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.560
[Guest]: And the second is because the purpose of living is to have some peace of mind and happiness,

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.200
[Guest]: which is a mental state. It's not a physical state. So really the whole point of us being

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:54.000
[Guest]: alive and seeking utility and maximizing utils is about a state of mind. It's about having

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.360
[Guest]: peace of mind, being comfortable with what you are doing, finding meaning and purpose

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.160
[Guest]: in your life rather than being on a treadmill. So these problems are intricately connected

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:09.400
[Guest]: to the state of health of the person. A lot of the hard driving people who are extremely

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:14.880
[Guest]: ambitious are actually very messed up, both in terms of the state of mind and in the state

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.520
[Guest]: of body. So these are difficult, difficult problems. And the present Indian healthcare

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:24.040
[Guest]: establishment has no interest at all in you as a human being. They don't want to talk

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:29.640
[Guest]: about your state of stress and your unhealthy lifestyle. And what you really need a lot

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.640
[Guest]: of the time is a good talking to by a wise person saying, dude, you need to fix your

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.080
[Guest]: life. Instead, the healthcare provider is saying, yeah, come here. I'll put you under

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.840
[Guest]: the knife and I'll fix you up. And sure enough, two years from now, you're going to be messed

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:47.440
[Guest]: up again. This is a profoundly different perspective that I think we need to bring to bear on our

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:53.240
[Guest]: lives as individuals. But putting our heads into it as thinkers and economists and thinking

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:59.520
[Guest]: about the state and society, it is very difficult to create the correct incentives for a healthcare

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.640
[Guest]: system that would even pause to think about these things. Because for the healthcare provider,

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.760
[Guest]: it's literally how many rupees can I make per minute? So becoming avuncular and having

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.520
[Guest]: a good conversation with you is not that person's incentive.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:17.340
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And it strikes me that there's an intersection of different domains here, which are kind

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:23.480
[Amit Varma]: of separate, like obviously one of those domains is this mental wellness stuff and all of that.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:28.360
[Amit Varma]: And a doctor who's there to treat the body who's been trained in say, cardiology or,

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, vascular disease or whatever might well say that look, I've been trained in this

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.720
[Amit Varma]: and this is what I will do the treatment in and the wellness is for other folks and I

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.360
[Amit Varma]: kind of get that. The other two sort of different domains and you'd elaborated on this last

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.520
[Amit Varma]: time and I intend to ask you about it after this question is of course, the two separate

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.200
[Amit Varma]: domains of public health and healthcare where public health really falls into prevention

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:53.240
[Amit Varma]: and should be the responsibility of the state. And healthcare is much more of a kind of private

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:58.160
[Amit Varma]: thing. But my specific question about the private situation remains in the sense that,

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:02.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, everybody wants to make money. Everybody's greedy, not just the doctors, you know, I

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.720
[Amit Varma]: am greedy, you are greedy in different ways. And everybody's not necessarily greedy for

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.140
[Amit Varma]: money, but that's fine. You want to make money? How do you make money? You make money by making

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.720
[Amit Varma]: someone else's life better off. It's a positive sum game. The incentives are good. Here, of

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.360
[Amit Varma]: course, the incentives are kind of the problem because the asymmetric information is getting

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.240
[Amit Varma]: in the way because patients don't know what's good for them. They have no option but to

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:28.040
[Amit Varma]: listen to what the doctor prescribes and the doctor will, you know, go down all of these

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.920
[Amit Varma]: roads where he gets maximum kickback and all that and they're responding to incentives.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.160
[Amit Varma]: I guess there are two key questions. One is what can be done to change the situation of

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.360
[Amit Varma]: asymmetric information, like you're saying in other fields like finance and all things

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:45.440
[Amit Varma]: have been done and they're working to whatever extent and more importantly, how do you change

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.800
[Amit Varma]: the incentives like in any other domain that I think about the way to change the incentives

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:55.840
[Amit Varma]: is that you let competition thrive and competition is the best regulation and you know, the incentives

00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:01.080
[Amit Varma]: kind of fall into place and by letting competition thrive, I mean, I don't just mean markets,

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:05.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean free markets. People often mix it up in India where we don't have free markets

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.000
[Amit Varma]: and anything at all. There is more and more cronyism where the whole idea is that big

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.520
[Amit Varma]: corporates want to keep competition out. But ideally, if you want to get the incentives

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.880
[Amit Varma]: right, you want to keep cronyism at bay, you want to keep state power at bay, you want

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.320
[Amit Varma]: the rule of law to be maintained, but you want competition. But in healthcare, the answer

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.520
[Amit Varma]: doesn't seem so simple. Like you said, for people who think about the world through this

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:33.160
[Amit Varma]: prism of voluntary action, positive sum games, competition, right incentives, all of that,

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.200
[Amit Varma]: somewhere it doesn't seem to apply, there is some problem. That's what I'm trying to

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:41.520
[Amit Varma]: put my finger on. So if I ask you to get specific, you know, what would that be?

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:49.080
[Guest]: The first piece would be that we are at the infancy in terms of studying and understanding

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:55.320
[Guest]: this field. And the first desperate need is more data. So we just don't know enough about

00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:00.520
[Guest]: this field. So I recall many other fields where I have worked on in previous years,

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:06.120
[Guest]: generally, when the work program began, there was a fair evidentiary base. So there is a

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:12.120
[Guest]: burning crisis in this field, which is the lack of data. So we need to go into the reality

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:18.160
[Guest]: of India, where there is 60, 70, 80% private healthcare, and the remainder is public healthcare.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.680
[Guest]: And we need to do measurement, measurement, measurement, make data sets and release them.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.040
[Guest]: And maybe for 10, 20 years, that's all that we are able to do. And out of that will come

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.640
[Guest]: better knowledge. This is my first sense of what is it that should practically be done.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.800
[Guest]: The first thing that needs to be done is we need to build data sets about what's actually

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:44.080
[Guest]: happening on the ground in the field of health. My second thought is that what we need is

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:50.800
[Guest]: sophisticated buyers who will exert countervailing force against sellers. Okay, so you and me

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:57.000
[Guest]: as customers, it doesn't work too well. I would readily have gone down the path of thinking

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.400
[Guest]: is there a role for the state and could you build some regulatory capacity? Could you

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:06.880
[Guest]: build some product liability, some tort law? And you should do a little bit of it, because

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:13.040
[Guest]: there is a role for some amount of liability and law and, you know, for example, just shutting

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:20.680
[Guest]: down the kickbacks is going to need force of law. So there is a need for tort law and

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:26.560
[Guest]: some amount of regulation. I say this softly, because at present, the project of the Indian

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:32.040
[Guest]: Regulatory State, the Indian Administrative State is really not working. So we need to

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.640
[Guest]: get to it at some point, but I'm not optimistic that that time is now, because right now that

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.360
[Guest]: project is in a bit of shambles. It's really working very poorly all across the landscape.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:49.520
[Guest]: We're not succeeding on the business of law, courts, judiciary, enforcement, regulators,

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:55.120
[Guest]: regulation, regulators, of course, private people. I used to be more optimistic about

00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:00.560
[Guest]: that agenda a while ago. Today, I think we've run aground and we need to really pick ourselves

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.280
[Guest]: up and make some of those basics work. And at a future date, it could have a significant

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:11.440
[Guest]: role in the field of health as well. And that's what brings me to sophisticated buyers. It

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.560
[Guest]: seems to me that the most useful thing to do today is to build a cadre of sophisticated

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:23.160
[Guest]: buyers and it can work in two ways. Basically, think of a health insurance company that says

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:29.680
[Guest]: to you that you give me X rupees a month and I'm responsible for all your health care.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:35.360
[Guest]: And imagine we do enough work around that sentence so that they don't actually shortchange

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:42.080
[Guest]: you. Because all too often in India, the health insurance company is just rejecting your claims

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.600
[Guest]: and is saying, sorry, I'm not going to pay. Assume for a moment that we found our way

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:51.560
[Guest]: through that. And then that health insurance company is able to be a tough, sophisticated

00:33:51.560 --> 00:34:00.760
[Guest]: buyer that can have negotiating power against health care organizations and can generate

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.720
[Guest]: better outcomes for the customer, can fight for the customer, can act for the customer.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.880
[Guest]: Otherwise, right now, you and I are just in a very bad bargaining position when we step

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:19.360
[Guest]: into a hospital. And the more urgent and the more heartrending the situation, the greater

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:24.960
[Guest]: is the extent to which we are likely to just go along and say yes to something that an

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:30.920
[Guest]: employee of the hospital says. And that's unfortunately not a very good thing. I mentioned

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:37.080
[Guest]: a health maintenance organization, an HMO, which in the limit is a consortium of health

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:44.600
[Guest]: care organizations and insurance, where it all comes together that you sign on for a

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.960
[Guest]: comprehensive agreement and they take care of you for life. They have specified clinical

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:55.360
[Guest]: protocols through which they will deliver health care to you. And we need to worry about

00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:01.360
[Guest]: consumer protection because they also have an incentive to underspend on your care. But

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:05.840
[Guest]: it seems to me that that's a good direction worth going in. And in India, the cutting

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:11.480
[Guest]: edge of this is insurance. But then you get into my old beat, which is insurance companies

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:17.840
[Guest]: and insurance regulation. And I have a fairly gloomy feeling about the state of capability

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:25.000
[Guest]: either in IRDA or in the insurance companies. So, none of these pathways are readily open

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.800
[Guest]: in India right now. They are all difficult, long journeys. That doesn't mean you should

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:35.240
[Guest]: not do them. So, if you tell me that a tree is going to take 20 years to fruition, I'll

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:40.720
[Guest]: say let's run out and plant it right now. So, it seems to me that work on data, work

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:46.920
[Guest]: on insurance companies, work on insurance regulation. These are the highest priorities

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.840
[Amit Varma]: in thinking about health care in India today.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.880
[Amit Varma]: So, a couple of questions that arise from this. One is, you spoke about the need for

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.800
[Amit Varma]: data about, you know, we need to gather data better. We need more specific data sets and

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.480
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth. And I just recorded an episode yesterday, which will actually go

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.760
[Amit Varma]: out after yours because, you know, vaccination is a more urgent subject. But I chatted with

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.960
[Amit Varma]: Gautam Menon, incredibly insightful episode. And if I remember correctly, I hope I'm not

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.880
[Amit Varma]: getting the source wrong. One of the things he spoke about in the episode was the data

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:21.240
[Amit Varma]: that we have in terms of cause of death. You know, about 80% of India won't give a, the

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:25.720
[Amit Varma]: deaths aren't recorded with a cause and blah, blah, blah. And the percentage where you actually

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:30.120
[Amit Varma]: know the cause of death that has happened is just something ludicrously low and therefore

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:35.040
[Amit Varma]: is not useful in any way. So, I understand that. And especially in the context of COVID,

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.040
[Amit Varma]: what we're seeing around us where, sorry.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:46.240
[Guest]: Causes of death is an exotic frontier in India today. Counting the dead is the immediate

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.560
[Guest]: battle. You go to New York City, you get a website where every day the number of dead

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:58.400
[Guest]: are reported. That data is exotic in India today. You just don't have the number of deaths

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:02.720
[Guest]: in India. So, the municipalities know what's happening in the crematoriums, but they don't

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.320
[Guest]: release. So, basic health data infrastructure in India is lacking.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:12.200
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough. And we are seeing that around us in these COVID times where not only don't

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.120
[Amit Varma]: we have accurate data about what's going on now, but it is likely that part of the reason

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:20.640
[Amit Varma]: for this present crisis was that we didn't get accurate data during the first wave as

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.160
[Amit Varma]: it were. And because we didn't understand the extent of the spread of the pandemic and

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:29.640
[Amit Varma]: the damage it caused, we didn't prepare as much as we should have. We weren't as alarmed

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:34.200
[Amit Varma]: as we should have been. We got complacent. But my specific question to you is this, that

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:39.200
[Amit Varma]: what kind of data sets are we talking about specifically? And what is the concrete difference

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:45.200
[Amit Varma]: that they make? You know that if you get X data, we'll be able to do Y thing or understand

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.140
[Amit Varma]: this aspect of the system better and make it better and pieces fall into place. Give

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.360
[Amit Varma]: me a sense of that with specifics if it's possible.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:59.080
[Guest]: What works is to just think blow by blow about the activities in a system of interest and

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:03.560
[Guest]: then just think of putting numbers to the whole thing. That's how we think of data sets.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:09.200
[Guest]: So let's start. Are people getting sick? Are people feeling well? Are people feeling healthy

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:14.320
[Guest]: is the first basic question. So you will get evidence about the extent to which people

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:19.160
[Guest]: say, I'm not feeling good today. And you will start looking at this on a map. You'll get

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.520
[Guest]: a heat map of where people are unwell in India. Is it younger people? Is it older people?

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.680
[Guest]: And so on. Right there, you will see some public health stories where arsenic in the

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:33.080
[Guest]: water makes you more unhealthy. And you know, it suggests public health interventions. OK,

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:38.880
[Guest]: fine. Then a person is feeling bad to the point where they seek health care. So I'd

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.960
[Guest]: like to know, you know, do different people have different psychological and affluence

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.920
[Guest]: trigger points for seeking health care? Very important to know that. What's the point at

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:53.200
[Guest]: which you decide that I'm going to go seek health care? What's the fever at which you

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.640
[Guest]: think it's OK to go to work? What's the fever at which you think it's not OK to go to work?

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:02.280
[Guest]: And then you decide that, OK, this is really no good. I've been down for three whole days.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:06.720
[Guest]: Now I need to go find health care. OK, then do you choose to go to a private facility?

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:11.160
[Guest]: Do you choose to go to a public facility? Then think of fine grained data where you

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:16.000
[Guest]: have the GPS cards of the household and the GPS cards of the provider and what determines

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.600
[Guest]: provider choice. OK, then you need to start creating data sets that understand there are

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:25.600
[Guest]: different categories of providers. There are complete quacks. You call it whatever you

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:32.200
[Guest]: call it, ayurvedic or homeopathic or uncertified or whatever. There's all kinds of quacks in

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.800
[Guest]: the landscape. Do you go to quacks or do you go to something that claims some semblance

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:41.240
[Guest]: of a medical education? And then, of course, there are medical colleges in India that do

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:46.640
[Guest]: next to nothing in terms of teaching people. So what's the human capital of the provider

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:51.840
[Guest]: and what shapes the choice of the individual? How does an individual choose? So is it that

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:56.120
[Guest]: if there are two children in the house, there's a boy and there's a girl and the household

00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:01.680
[Guest]: has different trigger points for the boy to get health care and the boy gets sent to some

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:07.440
[Guest]: serious MBBS doctor and the girl gets taken to a quack? OK, so what happens in the behavior

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:11.600
[Guest]: and the decision making of the household? Then what was the behavior and the decision

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:18.960
[Guest]: making of the providers that Jeff Hammers has once said to me that in his research on

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:27.740
[Guest]: India and medical care, here is his description of what actually happens in the modal conversation

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:33.480
[Guest]: between a health care professional and a patient. The patient goes and sits in a chair. The

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:39.800
[Guest]: health care professional utters two words, which in Hindi are, kya hai? OK, that's all,

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:45.520
[Guest]: which is what do you have? And the person says something about what symptoms that person

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.880
[Guest]: is suffering. The doctor scribbles a prescription, hands over the prescription. That's it. That's

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:54.840
[Guest]: all that happens by way of conversation and asks for some money. And this is it. This

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.920
[Guest]: is all health care interaction. So can we study these health care interactions? Do certain

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:05.680
[Guest]: kind of symptoms generate a different investigative tree on the part of the provider? Do certain

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:11.480
[Guest]: kind of patients go down a different investigative tree? If I speak in English with the doctor,

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:16.280
[Guest]: does the doctor treat me differently from if I speak in Marathi? OK, so these are all

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:20.240
[Guest]: the interesting questions to pursue that Jeff has always said to me that there are many

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.680
[Guest]: doctors in India who know a lot and they exercise their discretion and choose when to put their

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:29.480
[Guest]: knowledge into play. So it's not like the doctor is going to put full effort on every

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:34.760
[Guest]: single patient. The doctor has a notion that there is a patient where I'm just going to

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:39.280
[Guest]: spend two minutes and get 200 rupees and not really going to try. Whereas for certain patients,

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:44.160
[Guest]: I'm going to take more effort. And then finally, you get to the holy grail, which is that to

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:50.680
[Guest]: what extent did the visit to a health care professional make a marginal difference to

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:55.280
[Guest]: making the person better off? And that can be viewed in many different ways. As all of

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.320
[Guest]: us know, in a large fraction of problems, if you're just going to sit home and do absolutely

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:03.920
[Guest]: nothing, odds are you're going to get better. And under many, many circumstances, the human

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.880
[Guest]: just gets better. So you need to think about treatment and control where case one, the

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.400
[Guest]: person does absolutely nothing. Case two, the person goes to a health care provider.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:17.480
[Guest]: Did you get better or did you get mis-prescribed some bad things? And did it actually do damage

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.600
[Guest]: to your life? And then finally, you go closer to the wellness question that to what extent

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:27.560
[Guest]: do episodes of health care create conditions for going towards higher wellness versus to

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:33.520
[Guest]: what extent do interactions with the health care business generate a mere medicalization?

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:38.160
[Guest]: So you just go back over and over and keep going through one bout of medicalization after

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:44.240
[Guest]: another. So this is a sort of flow perspective of thinking from the viewpoint of one household.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.960
[Guest]: Think of all the things that they do and imagine in some dream world where we measure, measure,

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.960
[Guest]: measure, measure. And we think about how different kinds of health care establishments, different

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:58.400
[Guest]: kinds of tariff structures, presence of an insurance company as a counterweight in negotiating

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.760
[Guest]: power, does it change the behavior of the hospital and so on. So these are all the research

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.200
[Guest]: questions that can flow from this kind of detailed, comprehensive measurement.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.320
[Amit Varma]: Fabulous. And I guess if this data is all publicly available, then what also happens

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:14.960
[Amit Varma]: is that entrepreneurs everywhere get a sense of which are the problems that need to be

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:19.440
[Amit Varma]: solved. And today we don't even have an adequate idea of that. So we have blunt tools for blunt

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:23.720
[Amit Varma]: problems and they might not achieve anything. The other strand I want to take up from what

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.920
[Amit Varma]: you said before was when you spoke about the necessity.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:34.400
[Guest]: If I may just stay on that data subject, there is a lot of well-meaning philanthropy in India

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:43.400
[Guest]: where people try to do well. And the answer is that let me go build a free hospital or

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:52.120
[Guest]: let me go to underserved places like Bihar and run programs to do nutrition interventions

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:59.440
[Guest]: or vaccinations for kids. And I'll try to make kids in Bihar healthier. And in my opinion,

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:06.080
[Guest]: while these things mean well, they don't solve the problem. So the system is broken. And

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:14.080
[Guest]: the highest bang for the buck is in understanding the system, in building knowledge, and in

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:20.640
[Guest]: that long journey of the deeper transformation that is required. So I've seen lots of well-meaning

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:29.320
[Guest]: people put resourcing into these things and frankly just generate, work on the epiphenomena,

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:34.600
[Guest]: which it just feels good. So there is an instinctive and emotional thing that, oh, there's a person

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.840
[Guest]: who's feeling bad or there are so many million children dying in Uttar Pradesh and I want

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:44.320
[Guest]: to make a dent to the number of kids who are dying in Uttar Pradesh. I feel that it would

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:50.040
[Guest]: be more effective to be cold and to be intellectual and to build knowledge and to build a research

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.760
[Guest]: community because that's where we will get the deeper solutions and we will stop this

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.560
[Guest]: thing for life. Otherwise, there's a boat that's leaking and you're just bailing and

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.560
[Guest]: you're bailing and we're just not bailing enough to make a material difference. And

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:06.200
[Guest]: year after year, the Indian health system is getting more and more locked into horrible

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:12.120
[Guest]: incentives and don't underestimate the political economy problems of the incentives because

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:19.360
[Guest]: the malfunctioning heart surgeons of India have all the politicians of India on their

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:24.720
[Guest]: little black books. So they're an extremely effective lobby and when the country changes

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:30.280
[Guest]: in ways that question their privileges and income, they're going to lobby to change things

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:35.400
[Guest]: in their way. So every year that we go down this route of bad incentives, we actually

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:42.880
[Guest]: make things worse. So I feel that we really need to think more effectively in the world

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:50.440
[Guest]: of the well-meaning, generous, philanthropic people who are trying to put resourcing into

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:58.900
[Guest]: solving this problem. They need to step away from the instant rush of happiness that comes

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:04.760
[Guest]: from feeding one child to the more abstract conception of building knowledge and building

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:09.440
[Guest]: a research community and building greater thinking capabilities in this country because

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.560
[Guest]: in the end, that's the only way we're ever going to solve things. So let me for a moment,

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, leave the previous strand and I'll come back to that strand later before we pursue

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.000
[Amit Varma]: other strands, but take up this trend. And in this trend, let's move away from the abstract

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.400
[Amit Varma]: to the concrete. Let's say that a philanthropist comes to you tomorrow, maybe after listening

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:30.240
[Amit Varma]: to this episode and says that, oh, you know, I heard you in that episode and I want to

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.200
[Amit Varma]: give you $100 million to spend on health care as you will. And I was going to build hospitals

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.760
[Amit Varma]: in Bihar, but I have realized that that is giving a hungry man a fish. I want to teach

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:44.240
[Amit Varma]: him to fish. I mean, broadly, I just want to make the system work much better. So you,

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:49.320
[Amit Varma]: Ajay Shah, take my $100 million and spend it on improving health care in India. I don't

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:54.120
[Amit Varma]: care if you're playing the long game, have a 20 year span by all means, but use your

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.320
[Amit Varma]: wisdom and spend it. What are you doing with that $100 million?

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.320
[Guest]: All the things that I said from the beginning.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:03.760
[Guest]: You said abstract things. Give me a few concrete things. I'll set up this, I'll set up that.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.800
[Guest]: Build datasets, build research, build researchers, build community, build health policy thinking,

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.520
[Guest]: build health policy debate. One of the tragedies of this country is that we tend to assume

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:16.960
[Guest]: that a doctor thinks health policy. This is completely incorrect. A doctor knows how to

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:22.040
[Guest]: cut open my chest and perform surgery upon my heart, does not know how to think about

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:29.280
[Guest]: incentives, markets and systems. So we need to go down the route of building knowledge,

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:36.760
[Guest]: building research, building researchers, and also on some of the science and business models

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:46.400
[Guest]: around some of the innovations about telemedicine and AI and basically a nurse assisted system

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.480
[Guest]: which would be able to operate in remote places of India because we're not going to have enough

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:56.120
[Guest]: doctors for the foreseeable future. So this would be my thought process on the big problems

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.280
[Guest]: that require solving.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.760
[Amit Varma]: So now to come back to my earlier strand where we were speaking about how if you have enough

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:05.000
[Amit Varma]: data entrepreneurs kind of know what holes in the market to fill or what problems to

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.960
[Amit Varma]: solve. And you also mentioned the necessity of having sophisticated buyers who understand

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.640
[Amit Varma]: what they're buying into and some of the symmetry of information goes. Now one way of doing

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:20.600
[Amit Varma]: this, as you said, is insurance companies, but there the incentives are also going in

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:24.720
[Amit Varma]: another direction and I don't know how that works out. And it strikes me that this is

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:30.920
[Amit Varma]: also a great market opportunity that entrepreneurs can look at this lack of sophisticated buyers

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.920
[Amit Varma]: or the lack that every individual would feel of a sophisticated buyer within herself and

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.280
[Amit Varma]: say that, okay, how do I kind of fill this gap? Do you think there's a gap like that?

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:44.040
[Amit Varma]: And what role do you think AI can have in filling that gap? Like one of the things that

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.920
[Amit Varma]: we've seen during COVID, one of the great tragedies, in fact, I mean, it's just so sad

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:52.440
[Amit Varma]: when the Twitter timeline is full of calls for plasma and remdesivir and we know that

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:58.600
[Amit Varma]: plasma does not work. And remdesivir basically does not work in the context of delaying fatalities

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:03.600
[Amit Varma]: or in serious cases at all. It's just a waste of time. And yet, you know, patients will

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:08.160
[Amit Varma]: go to doctors and say, Oh, what about plasma? What about remdesivir? Doctors will, you know,

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.680
[Amit Varma]: just go by the form and as I'm okay, fine, you know, to get the patients off their back.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:17.480
[Amit Varma]: I've actually heard of people, relatives of patients contracting COVID because they've

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:21.920
[Amit Varma]: been running all around the city trying to get plasma and remdesivir. And this just seems

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:27.400
[Amit Varma]: so completely ridiculous. And you can't blame them because in that moment, in that chaos

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:31.840
[Amit Varma]: of emotion in the middle of Armageddon, as it were, when you could have an aged parent

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:36.040
[Amit Varma]: on oxygen and the doctors telling you get this, get that, in that moment, you can't

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:41.440
[Amit Varma]: expect sophistication. Is there a way where outside the current system, there is a disruptive

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.640
[Amit Varma]: way of coming in and solving for this problem? Maybe in the long run, you know, AI could

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:49.440
[Amit Varma]: be part of the puzzle. But you know, what are your thoughts?

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:57.280
[Guest]: So bottleneck is scale. Okay, so the entire Indian healthcare landscape is broken, particularly

00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:05.400
[Guest]: in North India. Okay, so I want to use a word, which will set off alarm bells in the minds

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:10.440
[Guest]: of many people, but I want to use the word corruption. So when a doctor distorts her

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:17.960
[Guest]: professional judgment in return for some kickbacks, I call that corruption. And the entire business

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:24.840
[Guest]: model of individuals and organizations is rooted around these corrupt practices. It's

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:30.000
[Guest]: not easy for any one organization to change that. So imagine, you and I are going to set

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.280
[Guest]: up a brand new hospital, and we will have a different wage structure for the doctors

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:41.800
[Guest]: that we might hire. And we will say to the doctors, no kickbacks. Okay, and the quick

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:47.720
[Guest]: outcome will be no sensible profit maximizing doctor will want to join us. How do you overcome

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.320
[Guest]: that? Christian Medical College, well, it has solved that problem. Because they have

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:59.400
[Guest]: created an amazing history, a culture, a tradition. And they've managed to say this to a large

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:04.320
[Guest]: number of early stage doctors in their careers that look, if you have these kind of values,

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.720
[Guest]: come back and be with us. And that's how they have overcome the problem. But there is no

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.760
[Guest]: ready business model through which you can overcome this problem. By the way, we've seen

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:18.440
[Guest]: this exact same problem in finance. Okay, so in finance, we have that same pervasive

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:24.040
[Guest]: problem. Naciket Moore and Bindu Anand and others built a remarkable organization that

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:32.600
[Guest]: is called KGFS. Today, KGFS is significantly profitable. And they began going to remote

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.720
[Guest]: locations where there was not even a bank branch and performing basic financial services

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.000
[Guest]: for poor people. Okay, and it was great, more power to them. The trouble is, if you try

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.160
[Guest]: bringing that model to a city, and in the city, you're competing against hard driving

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:52.000
[Guest]: finance distributors, and finance salespeople who are being given kickbacks, how do you

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.280
[Guest]: compete with that and an organization where employees get salaries and employees don't

00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:04.360
[Guest]: get kickbacks will not easily be able to compete against the kickback model until a lot goes

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:09.760
[Guest]: in in terms of getting the message to households that you really should not be dealing with

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:17.080
[Guest]: these toxic characters. Okay, so I used to do innumerable talks in finance, and I used

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:22.920
[Guest]: to always try to put in a public service announcement that please don't ever buy an insurance product

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:28.380
[Guest]: in India, because the entire business model of insurance is broken. And it took years

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:33.800
[Guest]: and years and years of that. But there have been significant improvements in the business

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:38.760
[Guest]: model of insurance companies, which were driven by the IRDA was driven by the state. So if

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:45.160
[Guest]: I make that analogy here, then we are up against a long slow battle that we'd need to build

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:51.280
[Guest]: some amount of, you know, medical malpractice law and tort law, and consumer protection

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:58.920
[Guest]: law and regulation of the behavior of medical persons. And the moment I say all this stuff,

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:04.200
[Guest]: I already start getting depressed. Because it is incredibly difficult to build this kind

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:08.800
[Guest]: of state capacity under Indian conditions. And in fact, we have failed in so many other

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:14.000
[Guest]: areas, that I don't think it's wise to recommend that toolkit for one more new area, it seems

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.600
[Guest]: to me we should fix it in the other areas. This is broken in all the other areas where

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:23.400
[Guest]: it's up and running. So, you know, I feel that the cutting edge, what one would say

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:29.520
[Guest]: to the philanthropist, the cutting edge of health policy is to make SEBI work better.

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:33.280
[Guest]: Because if one day we get to a SEBI that works, we'll be able to take elements of that law

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.920
[Guest]: and organization design and apply that to health.

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:40.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, that makes sense that, you know, given state capacity, we haven't managed to

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:47.160
[Amit Varma]: get ABC right, we can hardly speak of XYZ or even Shakespeare's plays.

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:52.960
[Guest]: And, you know, I'm very mindful of the word state coercion. So much as I like to complain

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:56.960
[Guest]: about kickbacks and corruption, the fact is, when you bring a coercive creature called

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:03.000
[Guest]: the state that has pretty bad consequences of its own. So we should think 20 times before

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.700
[Guest]: we bring state violence into the relationship between a doctor and a patient. It has its

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:12.440
[Guest]: own bad consequences, it will have its own malfunction. So let's not be starry eyed

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:17.120
[Guest]: about what state intervention would do. So we're caught between these two bad worlds.

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:23.200
[Guest]: And our pathway for the coming years is to build knowledge, is to build research, is

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.680
[Guest]: to build researchers, is to build data sets, is to build a health policy community, which

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.880
[Guest]: is distinct and separate from doctors.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:36.280
[Amit Varma]: Wonderful. So, you know, we could really do a four, five, eight, 10 hour episode on talking

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:41.120
[Amit Varma]: about healthcare. But I guess the urgent sort of imperative of the moment is to talk more

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:45.560
[Amit Varma]: about the economics and politics of vaccination. And, you know, what's happening with that

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:49.560
[Amit Varma]: in this current moment. But let's let's take a quick commercial break. And then on the

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:55.320
[Amit Varma]: other side of the break, we'll get to the subject at hand.

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:59.760

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen. I'm chatting with Ajay Shah and now finally

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:17.040
[Amit Varma]: chatting about the subject of this episode, the economics and politics of vaccines. So

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:22.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, before we actually get to vaccines, like one final question to set context, in

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:27.800
[Amit Varma]: the last episode we did together on farm bills, of all things, you spoke about the difference

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:32.960
[Amit Varma]: between public health and healthcare. And I think that's a difference, again, worth

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:37.720
[Amit Varma]: underscoring as a kind of context for our listeners. So can you can you tell me a little

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:43.440
[Amit Varma]: bit about how significant understanding that difference is for being actually able to grapple

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:47.560
[Guest]: with this problem? Public health is about actions that operate

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:53.840
[Guest]: on a population. Healthcare is about actions that operate on an individual. For example,

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:58.640
[Guest]: public health is fixing the air quality of North India. And healthcare is fixing the

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:04.400
[Guest]: respiratory illness of one person. Public health is about prevention. Healthcare is

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:09.200
[Guest]: about cure. Public health tends to generate public goods, which are non rival and non

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:14.400
[Guest]: excludable. Healthcare tends to be about private goods, which are excludable and rival. So

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:19.000
[Guest]: public health and healthcare are two different worlds in the story of the field of health.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.200
[Amit Varma]: Perfect. You know, you sent me an excellent paper that you'd written for the NCAER in

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:28.200
[Amit Varma]: July last year, which I found quite clear headed in thinking about vaccines. And there

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:33.360
[Amit Varma]: you asked five questions about vaccines, which are, you know, sort of an interesting way

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:38.560
[Amit Varma]: to set a frame for what was the problem that we faced at that time. It seems like distant

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:43.600
[Amit Varma]: history now July 2020. When was that even? Take me through the thinking about vaccines

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:48.000
[Amit Varma]: at that point. By July, we kind of realized that there will be vaccines at some point,

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.840
[Amit Varma]: though there were many skeptics who were saying, oh, there will never be a vaccine. There has

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:55.560
[Amit Varma]: never been a vaccine for a coronavirus. But at some point, we kind of realized that there

00:57:55.560 --> 00:58:00.080
[Amit Varma]: will be vaccines and it's kind of been miraculous how there actually are so many and that's

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:05.280
[Amit Varma]: crazy. But then the problem comes, what do we do with them? How do we vaccinate our population?

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:09.400
[Amit Varma]: Take me through the different nuances of the questions you need to ask at that point.

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:16.820
[Guest]: We would have to think about the extent to which a vaccine is useful and required in

00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:22.880
[Guest]: changing the disease dynamics. We would have to think about any prioritization questions

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:28.160
[Guest]: that to what extent would a pure private market work? To what extent is there a role for a

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:33.680
[Guest]: state and is there a role for some kinds of prioritization? We would need to think about

00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:41.440
[Guest]: the operational and institutional mechanisms on how to get vaccines out on scale. We'd

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:45.840
[Guest]: need to think about defining success, that at what point do you stop? Do you just keep

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:51.200
[Guest]: going? And in all this, I want to add one thing which is on my mind today, which was

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:57.360
[Guest]: not at the time of writing that article, which is, are we facing a one-off in the context

00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:03.200
[Guest]: of SARS-CoV-2 that we saw in 2020? Or are we thinking of something that is going to

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:12.800
[Guest]: be with us for a while in a more general sense of adults, epidemics, and vaccines? So today,

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:16.560
[Guest]: my thinking is much more in favor of, this is something that is going to be with us in

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:22.160
[Guest]: steady state, that vaccines and vaccination of adults is an important dimension of the

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.840
[Guest]: Indian health system. And so we need to find long-term, stable, sustainable solutions,

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:33.720
[Guest]: and not just think about it as a one campaign to solve one problem of one pandemic.

00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:39.960
[Amit Varma]: And you've kind of also discussed in another presentation you made later, which I'll also

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:43.840
[Amit Varma]: link from the show notes, where you've looked at previous pandemics, and you've pointed

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:49.160
[Amit Varma]: out, for example, how the challenges that we were facing were different from, say, smallpox.

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:54.320
[Amit Varma]: And smallpox, obviously, was a population scale success story. But we didn't require

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:59.360
[Amit Varma]: a cold chain. The timescales were different. We could do it over a period of a few years.

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.760
[Amit Varma]: Testing was far easier because people were symptomatic. You just had to look at someone

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.840
[Amit Varma]: to know if they got it. And it kind of worked. And similar attempts on malaria and polio

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:13.840
[Amit Varma]: had much more mixed results. So give me a sense of the challenges that we kind of faced

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:18.360
[Amit Varma]: in sort of rolling out this whole program at the start. What were the challenges when

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.960
[Amit Varma]: it came to administrative capacity? What were the challenges when it came to the actual

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:28.240
[Amit Varma]: states where it would be administered? Give me a sense of some of these constraints. And

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:32.520
[Amit Varma]: this is obviously just one aspect of it. I mean, there are two ways to get all of this

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:37.680
[Amit Varma]: done. One is that the state kind of does everything. And the other is that, you know, the state

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.240
[Amit Varma]: does whatever it can, but you let private players also function. And we'll discuss those

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:47.600
[Amit Varma]: different approaches and sort of their implications after this. But just looking at the state

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:53.000
[Amit Varma]: for the moment, what are we really facing? Like, we are facing a state which not only

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.880
[Amit Varma]: has severe constraints, but very often, one of those constraints is an intellectual constraint

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.760
[Amit Varma]: where it doesn't even understand that there are constraints. And it doesn't even understand

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:08.360
[Amit Varma]: the scope of the task which is being undertaken, so to say. So as someone who's almost been

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:12.520
[Amit Varma]: part of the state who's worked with the state for over 20 years, when you sit down and you

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.240
[Amit Varma]: look at the scale of this, what are the pain points which really begin to worry you where

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:21.440
[Amit Varma]: you sort of sit back and, you know, wonder how it's going to happen at all?

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:29.520
[Guest]: I talked about smallpox in that NCEER talk, which is going to turn into a paper soon.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:35.200
[Guest]: Because for me from childhood, that was just like one of the most glorious moments in world

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:41.240
[Guest]: history and India's history. Can you imagine a more horrendous disease than smallpox with

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:48.760
[Guest]: something with a case fatality rate like 25%? And where you are able to vaccinate everybody

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:53.640
[Guest]: in the country against it, and where what we achieved as the human race was eradication.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:02:01.600
[Guest]: This is like the highest dream that could ever be sought after. And whenever anybody

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.040
[Guest]: in India dreams vaccination, and you think big, you dream of the smallpox episode. And

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:12.260
[Guest]: yet the moment you start going down this route, there are so many differences that are holding

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:17.520
[Guest]: us back today. As you were checklisting, the smallpox campaign was done over many, many

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.240
[Guest]: years. It was not done in a short time. For whatever reason, today in the modern world,

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.960
[Guest]: we had to finish with the COVID-19 pandemic quickly. We don't have the choice of saying

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:33.920
[Guest]: we'll take five years over it. The smallpox campaign involved a heat stable vaccine. And

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.920
[Guest]: there was no difficulty of a cold chain. You could easily transport it to any corner of

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.360
[Guest]: the country. In the smallpox story, there was not this complexity of asymptomatic people.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.360
[Guest]: So you really had to glance at the face of a person and you knew that they were sick.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:53.720
[Guest]: And so then you would put a ring around that population and go after it. So it was a more

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.800
[Guest]: trace test, isolate kind of approach that was applied to keep finding pockets of smallpox

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:05.640
[Guest]: and getting them under control. And you would also suspect that all in all, the state capacity

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:14.920
[Guest]: of the Republic of India in the 70s was significantly superior to what we have today. That's a non-obvious

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:15.920
[Amit Varma]: proposition.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.480
[Amit Varma]: Why do you say that? That is non-obvious.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.360
[Guest]: We tend to think that because GDP is higher, state capacity is higher. GDP is higher because

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:27.760
[Guest]: there's more capital, there's more technology, there's more labor, the firms are more sophisticated.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:32.360
[Guest]: But if you think of the ability of an Indian state in the early 70s to make up its mind

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:39.840
[Guest]: to collaborate with a WHO, have 50 overseas experts be living here in India, collaborating,

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.760
[Guest]: participating and running a campaign all across the country to eradicate smallpox. My opinion

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:49.120
[Guest]: is that no, today we can't do it. We don't have that capability in the Indian bureaucracy

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.120
[Amit Varma]: today.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:55.600
[Amit Varma]: Why? Why have we degraded? Is it a natural degradation that you'd expect given the nature

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.640
[Amit Varma]: of bureaucracy and the way things play out and all of that?

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:04.560
[Guest]: No, it's not the natural degradation. I remain an optimistic person. And I think that the

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.520
[Guest]: natural trajectory of the world is that we learn and things get better. But I think that

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:16.840
[Guest]: over these decades, the Indian state has become swamped by so many challenges. And there were

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:21.240
[Guest]: elements of the working of the Indian state that were not institutionalized. So it worked

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:26.680
[Guest]: in the hands of a certain kind of person. And it doesn't work in the hands of different

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:33.080
[Guest]: people. So we didn't build it out as an institution. So the way things work today are very different

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.480
[Guest]: from the way things worked in the 70s.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:41.160
[Guest]: By the way, if you have some good conversations with people in the army, and you ask them,

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:46.920
[Guest]: could you do a 1971 campaign in Bangladesh today, they would offer you lots of concerns

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:53.480
[Guest]: that what was done in 71 was just outrageously great. But that level of operational capability,

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:59.440
[Guest]: confidence, competence, logistics, decision making, it is harder and harder to find that

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.560
[Guest]: today in the Indian state. So I think that there's a deeper decline of capability that

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:09.320
[Guest]: has been going on in the Indian state. And many of us, we tend to jump to the conclusion

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:13.880
[Guest]: that because the GDP is higher, the state capacity must be higher. I think that there

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:20.560
[Guest]: are many ways in which that's not true. There is a book which is called Building State Capacity

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:27.040
[Guest]: by Lan Pritchett and co-authors. They have a measure of state capacity in that book.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:35.200
[Guest]: And going by their measurement, they find that from the mid 90s to the middle 2010s,

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:41.480
[Guest]: in India's case, the state capacity actually got worse, and better while the GDP grew greatly.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:48.000
[Guest]: So I think all of us need to decompose our minds that you have a firm like Infosys, it's

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.880
[Guest]: a great firm, they make GDP, it's fabulous. That doesn't mean that the Indian state is

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.880
[Amit Varma]: better.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:57.120
[Amit Varma]: Wow, fascinating. So, you know, one of the episodes of the scene in the unseen, which

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:02.200
[Amit Varma]: has been a gateway drug for many people, it's not even one of the top 25 episodes of the

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:06.920
[Amit Varma]: show in terms of downloads. But as a gateway drug, it remains huge is an episode I did

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:12.480
[Amit Varma]: with Srinath Raghavan on the 1971 war to free Bangladesh and has stunning insights on what

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.140
[Amit Varma]: really went on there. But my question is on the why. So let's say I'll take your word

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:22.080
[Amit Varma]: for it that okay, as far as the what is concerned, fine, the state degraded, but why did it degrade?

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:26.640
[Amit Varma]: Like, of course, I agree with the contention that ideally, you want institutions where

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:30.280
[Amit Varma]: it doesn't matter who the individuals are, whether they are good people or bad people,

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:35.240
[Amit Varma]: the institutions are robust enough that everything just works. And bad or good individuals only

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:40.880
[Amit Varma]: make a difference on the margins. One, I don't think we ever had that. And two, assuming

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:46.640
[Amit Varma]: that our institutions have degraded and state capacity has degraded. Do you have any, what

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.440
[Amit Varma]: are your hypothesis on the why of that? Why did that happen? Like, I'm just trying to

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.480
[Amit Varma]: understand it structurally.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:57.920
[Guest]: So we came out of colonial rule, which was not democratic rule. And it was based on a

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:04.560
[Guest]: certain conception of some ruling class. And we basically switched around that ruling class

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:10.720
[Guest]: class. And there was a new Indian National Congress, and there was a new Indian Civil

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:17.240
[Guest]: Service come IAS, and they became the new ruling class. The Indian population was relatively

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:21.880
[Guest]: small, the Indian GDP was relatively small, the demands made upon the Indian state were

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:27.620
[Guest]: relatively small. So in the early years, that combination of autocratic rule, modest population

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:32.600
[Guest]: and modest objectives of the state delivered a certain level of state competence and state

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:38.920
[Guest]: capacity. And then as the years went by, the Indian state got overrun with a larger and

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:44.200
[Guest]: larger number of demands. The scope of the attempts at welfarism today are of a different

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:51.640
[Guest]: order altogether. Adjacent institutions corroded. So what was supposed to be a co-equal balancing

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:56.640
[Guest]: act between an executive and a legislature and a judiciary, tended to break down and

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:03.680
[Guest]: we became more of an administrative state. And the simple INC domination went away. So

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.080
[Guest]: now you have a complicated political landscape, where there are many different political parties.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.920
[Guest]: And then the nature of the conversation between the political leadership and the executive

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.760
[Guest]: changed. It was no longer the case that the executive was working with just the Congress

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:21.120
[Guest]: for long periods of time. Now it became complicated that this executive, this bureaucrat is friendly

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:26.120
[Guest]: with this party, this bureaucrat is friendly with this party. So you start getting destruction

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:33.360
[Guest]: of institutional memory each time a new political party comes into power. We are unable to manage

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:38.760
[Guest]: knowledge and insights across long periods of time. So all these pieces, they come together.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:44.120
[Guest]: There's also a new character of the people that are going into civil service today. In

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.160
[Guest]: 1947, some of the best people in India thought that becoming an employee of the government

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:55.940
[Guest]: was pretty cool, partly out of the nobility and the morale of Gandhiji and Nehru and partly

01:08:55.940 --> 01:09:01.200
[Guest]: out of simple economic considerations, because those were relatively well paid jobs. Today,

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:06.840
[Guest]: it's more or less upside down on both counts. So there is a qualitative change in the nature

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:13.360
[Guest]: of the people that we meet. I have been in policy discussions for the longest time. And

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:18.920
[Guest]: it's not very inspiring the quality in the room that you get in many policy discussions

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:25.080
[Guest]: today. And my subjective opinion is that when I was very young, and there were people in

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:31.160
[Guest]: the room that I used to look up to, I thought that they ran better policy discussions. When

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:36.320
[Guest]: I was the youngest person in the room and least important person in the room. I used

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:39.040
[Guest]: to admire the quality of the conversation that used to take place.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:43.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, fair enough. I mean, one never wants to be the smartest person in the room. That's

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:47.840
[Amit Varma]: not a good situation to be in a number of stands. And I'll get a little discursive here.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.720
[Amit Varma]: And I promise the listeners, I'll come back to vaccines. But all of this is kind of fascinating

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.880
[Amit Varma]: and just getting that deeper bedrock of understanding of what's going on. And this is, you know,

01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.880
[Amit Varma]: the degradation of the Indian state, as you mentioned, it is a kind of an interesting

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.120
[Amit Varma]: new thing that I need to think about. One, you mentioned colonialism, and it was just

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:10.720
[Amit Varma]: like I was just thinking today, that in a sense, the Indian state's abdication in the

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.760
[Amit Varma]: face of this current crisis is similar to what our British colonial masters were often

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:21.160
[Amit Varma]: accused of. And it came to the various famines that happened through the centuries, where

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:27.440
[Amit Varma]: you had a natural disaster, and it was completely either ignored or even exacerbated by the

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:33.200
[Amit Varma]: callous apathetic reaction of the colonial masters, who were in who would, in fact, quite

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.500
[Amit Varma]: often just denied that there was a problem at all. And we've kind of seen that play out

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:41.660
[Amit Varma]: and we see that play out again. And I keep talking about how, you know, we didn't actually

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:48.120
[Amit Varma]: gain true independence in that sense. In 47, we merely passed over an oppressive colonial

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:53.360
[Amit Varma]: state from a set of white-skinned rulers to a set of brown-skinned rulers, only the colour

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:59.120
[Amit Varma]: changed, the essential nature stayed the same. The other interesting aspect, I was going

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:03.000
[Amit Varma]: to talk to you about fundamentally coercive nature of the state. And the thing is, when

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.680
[Amit Varma]: we talk about the coercive nature of the state, it seems to imply that there is a non-coercive

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:11.960
[Amit Varma]: nature as well, which of course is not the case. Everything the state does is coercive.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:18.080
[Guest]: And the only question is what? I think the interesting distinction is undemocratic coercion

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.480
[Guest]: versus democratic legitimacy. I think that's the interesting line, that what we aspire

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:29.360
[Guest]: to as a republic is the legitimacy of coercion that is channelled in an ethical and just

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:35.680
[Guest]: fashion, as opposed to the rule of a few people that's an oligarchy where there is absolute

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.600
[Amit Varma]: power with a few people. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I was finishing my thought by sort of expressing

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:44.720
[Amit Varma]: something along those lines, which is that everything the state does is coercive, except

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:51.040
[Amit Varma]: that we need the state and some of that coercion is justified. And all ideology really falls

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:55.080
[Amit Varma]: down on the margins. Where do you draw that line? And where do you decide what coercion

01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:01.520
[Amit Varma]: is justified and what is not? And obviously, in a democracy as well, the question of legitimacy

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:06.360
[Amit Varma]: comes up. But speaking of coercion, and you used that phrase many times in both your wonderful

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:12.360
[Amit Varma]: book with Vijay Kelkar and in your recent articles on this current crisis, and it reminded

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:16.800
[Amit Varma]: me of Adam Smith's Man of System. And I'll just read this passage out for my listeners.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.840
[Amit Varma]: This is from the Theory of Moral Sentiments. And there he writes, and you'll find this

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:27.320
[Amit Varma]: person recognisable. In that he writes, quote, the man of system is apt to be very wise in

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.520
[Amit Varma]: his own conceit, and is often so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his ideal plan

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.880
[Amit Varma]: of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it. He goes on

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:40.040
[Amit Varma]: to establish it completely and in all its parts, without any regard either to the great

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:44.240
[Amit Varma]: interests or to the strong prejudices which may oppose it. He seems to imagine that he

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.820
[Amit Varma]: can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as a hand arranges

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:53.720
[Amit Varma]: the different pieces upon a chessboard. He does not consider that the pieces upon the

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:57.720
[Amit Varma]: chessboard have no other principle of motion besides that which the hand impresses upon

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:02.280
[Amit Varma]: them, but that in the great chessboard of human society, every single piece has a principle

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:07.600
[Amit Varma]: of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might choose

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:13.000
[Amit Varma]: to impress upon it, stop quote, a sort of version of what Hayek called the fatal conceit.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.280
[Amit Varma]: And we see that our founders in a sense, or at least the influential founders were men

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.080
[Amit Varma]: of system, which is why we have all the central planning, the state is going to do everything.

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:27.000
[Amit Varma]: And as you point out that it's a much more manageable task in the early years compared

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:33.400
[Amit Varma]: to what it later became. So I'd assume that that's sort of one aspect of it that if you

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.480
[Amit Varma]: are, you know, if you think like a man of system, you just have less chess pieces to

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:42.200
[Amit Varma]: move and less things going wrong, whereas in this globalized world, there are so many

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.200
[Amit Varma]: influences.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:50.200
[Guest]: There's a distinction we should make between a Lenin and a Stalin versus a Putin. Okay,

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:56.040
[Guest]: so in a Lenin and a Stalin, there is this grand design. You may disagree with that grand

01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:01.640
[Guest]: design. There is a grand design and there is an extreme ideological willingness to inflict

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:06.160
[Guest]: cruelty upon the people, because I know I am right and I am going to build that grand

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:11.600
[Guest]: design. So why did Stalin do collectivization? It made no sense for him in any pragmatic

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:19.320
[Guest]: sphere, but he was an ideologue. He was not just an ordinary tin pot dictator. So that's

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:27.240
[Guest]: the distinction that there is an ideologue who sees a dream and pursue some utopian ideal.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:35.060
[Guest]: And you and I would challenge the capability and legitimacy of anybody who tries to tell

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:39.920
[Guest]: us to live our lives going by their utopian ideal, but that's a separate point. But there

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:45.400
[Guest]: is intellectual approach of a Lenin and a Trotsky and a Stalin, which has a certain

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:50.040
[Guest]: kind of barbarism and a certain kind of consequence in terms of transforming society, because

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:57.360
[Guest]: the fact remains that the USSR went from a semi-Asiatic society in 1917 to the world's

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:04.240
[Guest]: greatest land power in 1945. So something transformative happened at a horrendous human

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:12.760
[Guest]: cost. And then you get to Vladimir Putin, who's really just all apparatchik and no philosophy.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:19.320
[Guest]: So Putin has no idea about what is the design of the world, but it's just a game of power.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:24.760
[Guest]: The only game is that he and a few others would like to concentrate power upon themselves,

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:32.240
[Guest]: would like to constantly identify anybody else who commands influence and destroy them.

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:38.800
[Guest]: And that creates the silence of a graveyard of a different nature. So it's interesting

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:44.600
[Guest]: to look at the world from this lens that there are the central planners who have some dream

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:50.240
[Guest]: world and often lead their world into ruin. And that's Pol Pot. He was a visionary that

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:57.720
[Guest]: led the country to the ruin. Or Mao. And then there are just elementary Marcos who are just

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:03.480
[Guest]: ordinary tin pot dictators, where it's just a game of always and always accumulating power,

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:10.440
[Guest]: grabbing power, monopolizing power, and shutting off every other energy and thinking and disagreement

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:14.760
[Guest]: in the economy. And I think these are two different kinds of pathologies to wonder about.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:18.760
[Amit Varma]: That's a very fine nuance. And it strikes me that obviously, one, I think our current

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:23.440
[Amit Varma]: rulers and I'll use the term rulers because I think we are more subjects and citizens

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:28.200
[Amit Varma]: away this country is today. Our current rulers are more in the Putin mold. I'd add to that

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:35.120
[Amit Varma]: and say that, you know, the obsession of say Modi and Shah is not so much governance as

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:38.920
[Amit Varma]: you'd imagine it should be in a democracy, because how else do you win elections, but

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:42.160
[Amit Varma]: is winning elections, which has nothing to do with governance, actually, it's all about

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.560
[Amit Varma]: narrative building. So they are all the time focused on elections and narrative building.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:50.840
[Amit Varma]: And that's what it's all about. And they can control that. And what the reality is doesn't

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:56.080
[Amit Varma]: matter as long as you can weave a story around it. And the other thing here that strikes

01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:01.520
[Amit Varma]: me is that, listen, you can win elections with central planning. You know, what Amit

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:07.480
[Amit Varma]: Shah did, in fact, as a campaign manager in 2014, is a staggering feat of management,

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:13.520
[Amit Varma]: in terms of reconfiguring all those caste vote banks, through UP, Maharashtra, everywhere,

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.040
[Amit Varma]: what they did, I mean, I had an episode on that with Prashant Jha as well, who wrote

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:21.280
[Amit Varma]: the book, How the BJP wins, staggering piece centrally done, but you can do that at the

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:26.480
[Amit Varma]: level of a, you know, controlling a party, you can do that at the level of controlling a country

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:32.800
[Amit Varma]: can't really plan things centrally. And you could argue that at one level, their intensity

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.880
[Amit Varma]: of effort never quite went into governing as much as elections, because the two really

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:41.380
[Amit Varma]: aren't related. And, you know, unless things get really bad, and you just want to win the

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:42.880
[Amit Varma]: election and control the narrative.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:51.400
[Guest]: Just another interpretation. Imagine central planning and top down management being applied

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:56.360
[Guest]: into both pathways with equal zeal and vigour.

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:57.440
[Amit Varma]: But incentives because

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.880
[Guest]: It just delivers better results in one than the other.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:04.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, because the party is a manageable beast, a country is not, it's just too many pieces

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:10.000
[Amit Varma]: on the chessboard, as it were to go back to Smith's Man of System analogy, which is why,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, something like, for example, if the same zeal had gone into rolling out vaccinations

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:20.400
[Amit Varma]: late last year, we would honestly not be in that situation right now, the situation that

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:25.480
[Amit Varma]: we are in, I think that's part of the issue. And part of the other issue is that even that

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:29.840
[Amit Varma]: would only solve part of the problem, that this whole Man of System approach central

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.560
[Amit Varma]: planning top down approach wasn't sufficient, as you have pointed out that they were, you

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.460
[Amit Varma]: know, different approaches you could take with vaccinations, you know, only one approach

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:42.680
[Amit Varma]: was the state does everything. And there, of course, it didn't do enough. But the other

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:49.280
[Amit Varma]: approach also was that you harness private enterprise, and you also side by side, allow

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:53.680
[Amit Varma]: them to kind of work with you. But maybe I'm kind of shifting ahead in the narrative. But

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:59.120
[Amit Varma]: these are the two broad policy choices that policymakers face, right? So tell me a little

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:04.080
[Amit Varma]: bit about what this choice was like. And was it inevitable that in our culture of top down

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:08.520
[Amit Varma]: central planning, state does it, the state controls everything kind of thinking that

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:13.840
[Amit Varma]: we would just say ki nahi state karega, and, you know, our subjects will line up and take

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:19.200
[Amit Varma]: the vaccines when their turn comes. And we won't allow private players in here. What

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:22.960
[Amit Varma]: was the sort of thinking like what were the pulls and pressures?

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:31.520
[Guest]: So in countries like Israel, and the US and the UK, the central government equivalents

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:39.480
[Guest]: took charge and built large scale vaccine rollouts. Okay, and regardless of what you

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:44.520
[Guest]: may think, or I may think, those things by and large work. Okay, so they had their critics,

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:50.000
[Guest]: they had their problems. Every centrally planned system has its own complexities. Let me give

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:56.000
[Guest]: you an example. Every centrally planned system will have a bright line rule, like, we will

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.520
[Guest]: do above age 45, we will not do below age 45. Whereas actually, what you need is far

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:09.000
[Guest]: more nuance. What are your comorbidities? What is your social life? Does your occupation

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.800
[Guest]: involve meeting more people or less people? So any simplistic bright line rule will do

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:19.320
[Guest]: badly. Whereas if people make more decisions for themselves, they'll do better. So you

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:25.840
[Guest]: can and should criticize every centrally planned system. Similarly, in the United States, what

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:32.520
[Guest]: is appearing to be a central system actually involves contracting with private people and

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:41.720
[Guest]: getting the job done in what you might see is a remarkable feat of government activism.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:46.480
[Guest]: So first, the government played a role in funding research and funding manufacturing

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:52.520
[Guest]: by vaccine manufacturers. At a time when there were risks, the government could have come

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:58.280
[Guest]: out blank with that money wasted and no vaccine. So they had the government systems that had

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:04.480
[Guest]: the capability to not stand back, to not wait for private people to bear the risk, but rather

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:08.720
[Guest]: to put up risk capital and say, here, we're funding research, or here, I'm giving you

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:16.120
[Guest]: an advanced purchase contract, so that a lot of work on vaccine research and vaccine manufacturing

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:20.240
[Guest]: got done ahead of time. So that was the first milestone of what the United States government

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:26.440
[Guest]: did right. And then, barring a few missteps, which got fixed along the way, it has worked

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:31.600
[Guest]: out into a pretty private sector system. So the United States government enters into contract

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:39.160
[Guest]: with Pfizer. Then the United States government has a contract with UPS to do the cryogenic

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:48.640
[Guest]: transportation from Pfizer's factories to the Walgreen and CVS shops on the roadside,

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:53.280
[Guest]: who are also private. And the United States government has a contract with the Walgreen

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:58.680
[Guest]: and the CVS to push vaccine into the arms of people. And then the United States government

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:02.960
[Guest]: has a mechanism to reach out to various people and say, it's your turn to set up a booking

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:08.380
[Guest]: system, a reservation system. So the point is that there was energy in their country

01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:14.760
[Guest]: for cryogenic transportation, for vaccine R&D, for vaccine manufacturing, and for the

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:20.900
[Guest]: last mile vaccination in the private sector. All this energy was harnessed in a collection

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:26.520
[Guest]: of contracts, and that's how they did it. But right now, I just want to harp on one

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:31.540
[Guest]: point, which is nothing succeeds like success. The bottom line is that the highly centralized

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:36.280
[Guest]: approaches of the US and the UK and countries like Israel have worked. They have delivered.

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:42.200
[Guest]: I respect those countries. I respect the policy choices, because the bottom line is, it worked.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:51.400
[Guest]: And if hypothetically, in India, we had similar levels of state capability, then I would not

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:59.120
[Guest]: be so stuck on ideology. So what I was writing and arguing in late 2020 was a practical point,

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:06.720
[Guest]: was a pragmatic point, that look back at smallpox, look back at the glory of the Indian state

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:14.400
[Guest]: that was able to eradicate smallpox in five years under higher levels of state capacity.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:18.280
[Guest]: And now compare that against where we are today. And do you think you'd be able to pull

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:24.360
[Guest]: this off? Okay, so here's a counterpoint. There are some 25 million infants who are

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:31.000
[Guest]: born in India every day, and a somewhat larger number of mothers. And ever since independence,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.540
[Guest]: there has been an attempt to try to bring down the maternal mortality rate and the infant

01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:41.960
[Guest]: mortality rate by getting vaccines out to mothers and infants. And as of today, the

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:48.600
[Guest]: coverage is like 60-80%. So at the end of all these years, we don't have a comprehensive

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:57.640
[Guest]: success with a small problem of 25 million infants. And my first law of management, my

01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:03.280
[Guest]: first law of public administration is that if you don't know how to do a 25 million problem

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:09.120
[Guest]: today, odds are you will not succeed on a 50 million problem tomorrow. And what was

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:15.440
[Guest]: needed was a 500 million or a 1 billion problem. My argument last year was that this is a problem

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.040
[Guest]: size that will elude the Indian. Now, let me turn away from the public administration

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:27.820
[Guest]: problem to more fundamental economics of a vaccine. If we had to think from scratch,

01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:34.920
[Guest]: do we really need a lot of state in the vaccine? And the answer is not a whole lot. Because

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:39.960
[Guest]: there is a substantial sense in which a vaccine is not a public good. A vaccine falls under

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:44.520
[Guest]: health care. It's not under public health. Why do I say that? A public good is something

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:51.480
[Guest]: that is non-rival and non-excludable. A vaccine is rival and excludable. If I get a dose of

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:56.240
[Guest]: vaccine, that particular dose is not available to you. And I can't shut off access to a newborn

01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:01.520
[Guest]: child of the vaccine. So, a vaccine is absolutely a private good. There is a market failure

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:07.000
[Guest]: and that market failure is an externality. What is going on is that when I get vaccinated,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.360
[Guest]: I impose some benefits upon you. Because when you and I have a social interaction, the disease

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:16.560
[Guest]: is less likely to come to you because I am involved. Because each person that gets a

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:23.880
[Guest]: vaccine imposes a certain amount of benefits upon bystanders. Now, the overall gains to

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:29.960
[Guest]: society when I get vaccinated are higher than my personal gains for myself. So, as with

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:36.680
[Guest]: other classic positive externality problems, such as education, we have a mismatch between

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:43.320
[Guest]: the individual incentive and the incentives of society. The individual is likely to under

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:50.600
[Guest]: invest in vaccination. So, some people have enough private interest that they will pay

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:55.680
[Guest]: the price of vaccination and they will do it for themselves. Some others might not,

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:59.680
[Guest]: because their personal incentives are not strong enough to pay for it on their own steam

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:04.640
[Guest]: and they don't give a damn about what's happening to everybody else. And there is a role for

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.720
[Guest]: state intervention potentially to change that. So, that's the market failure perspective

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:10.720
[Guest]: on vaccines.

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:17.400
[Guest]: The third and epidemiological perspective on vaccines teaches us that you actually don't

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:21.400
[Guest]: need every single person in the country to be vaccinated. You only need enough people

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:26.880
[Guest]: vaccinated to change the disease dynamics. So, we should always think of a combination

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:33.800
[Guest]: of people developing resistance to a disease. You can either get sick and get immune or

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:40.880
[Guest]: you can get vaccinated. But in either path, what happens is that at the end of it, generally,

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.040
[Guest]: you are now protected and you are no longer available for the spread of the disease. So,

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:50.080
[Guest]: we should always think that there are two highways where people are riding on. Some

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:53.760
[Guest]: people are getting sick and thereby getting immune. Some people are getting vaccinated

01:26:53.760 --> 01:27:00.680
[Guest]: and thereby getting immune. And when the two add up to something like 70, 80% of the population,

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.160
[Guest]: the basic mathematics of the disease changes and the disease rapidly dies away until a

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:09.360
[Guest]: new variant comes along. And I will come back to new variants later in the conversation

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:10.360
[Guest]: today.

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:16.640
[Guest]: So, in this full picture, what we need to think is that, case one, could we do a highly

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:22.000
[Guest]: state-led program to push up to herd immunity? Probably, that is not a very feasible path

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.680
[Guest]: under Indian conditions. Point two, do we even need a completely state-driven program

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:34.480
[Guest]: based on first principles, public economics, and public health reasoning about this problem?

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:39.640
[Guest]: The answer is no. There is a private good with an externality. Whenever a person like

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:44.480
[Guest]: you or I is able to pay 5,000 rupees and get the vaccine done, it is the perfect answer.

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:48.880
[Guest]: There is nothing wrong with it. The more people that get it, the better because you are reducing

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:53.040
[Guest]: the susceptibles. And also, the third point is to recognize that the very spread of the

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:58.200
[Guest]: disease is actually reducing the mass of the people that need vaccination. The current

01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:04.080
[Guest]: clinical guidelines are that if you have got sick once, you need one dose of Covishield

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:08.840
[Guest]: and not two. And that has a huge impact on the arithmetic of doses. Everybody is counting

01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:16.040
[Guest]: 1.4 billion people multiplied by two is 2.8 billion doses. That is not a correct calculation,

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:20.160
[Guest]: partly because you do not need to cover 100%, partly because for everybody that gets sick,

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:26.000
[Guest]: you do not need two doses, you need just one, and partly because while the program is running

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.960
[Guest]: and is on its path to completion, the differential equations are going to change their behavior

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:36.000
[Guest]: and the epidemic is just going to abruptly vanish like Donald Trump promised us many

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.240
[Amit Varma]: years ago. So a bunch of things that I want to kind of unpack there. You know, one fundamental

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.840
[Amit Varma]: aspect of this, which is what is the role of the state. Now, even someone who supports

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:49.040
[Amit Varma]: free markets like me and believes the state should not be in most things just through

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:53.040
[Amit Varma]: the rule of law would say that there are certain things the state must do where we need the

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:57.800
[Amit Varma]: state. Most libertarians also would say that you need a minimum government that among other

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:04.560
[Amit Varma]: things can fight wars, can save you from invaders outside. And my question really here is that

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:09.240
[Amit Varma]: we are at war with this virus, you know, it's not Pakistan or China or whatever, but we

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:13.960
[Amit Varma]: are at war with this virus. And therefore, you know, if the state is there to protect

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:17.920
[Amit Varma]: our rights, which is, you know, the fundamental reason for it to exist in the first place,

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:22.680
[Amit Varma]: it has to protect our lives, it has to take care of this aspect of things. Now, the problem

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:27.520
[Amit Varma]: here is that state capacity, as you've pointed out, is far better in the Western countries.

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:31.640
[Amit Varma]: For example, if you look at the way the American government responded, I think aspects of it

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:36.360
[Amit Varma]: are just outstanding. For example, what they did in the middle of last year, like you said,

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:41.320
[Amit Varma]: was you know, they made deals with companies who were working on vaccines, giving them

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:45.640
[Amit Varma]: advance orders, giving them grants, giving them money, therefore incentivizing them to

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:50.480
[Amit Varma]: keep going. It was not conditional upon whether the vaccine will work or this will whatever,

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:54.440
[Amit Varma]: it was just that we'll throw money at the problem, you build your capacity, you carry

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:58.920
[Amit Varma]: out whatever, let money not be a constraint, we are there, we'll spend the money. And that's

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:05.560
[Amit Varma]: absolutely necessary. In this case, you know, you need a government that, you know, they

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:10.280
[Amit Varma]: were wise enough to realize that you spend billions today to save trillions, because

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:14.280
[Amit Varma]: that is the cost to the economy, which is why, you know, it's completely fundamental

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:18.720
[Amit Varma]: to me that anyone who wants a free vaccine in India should be able to get it, they should

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:23.720
[Amit Varma]: not even be up for debate. Now, the issue here is when it comes to India is that our

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:28.760
[Amit Varma]: state capacity is abysmal, and that has consequences. Now, you've also pointed out that in the case

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:33.760
[Amit Varma]: of testing, where initially the state said, Hey, we will do everything, no private testing.

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:38.120
[Amit Varma]: And because of that testing was much slower than it should have been, data was worse than

01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:43.320
[Amit Varma]: it should have been. And a spillover effect of that possibly was because of lack of adequate

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:47.880
[Amit Varma]: data, we underestimated how bad the second wave would be and what we needed to do to

01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:52.920
[Amit Varma]: prepare. And once you had private testing come into play, things became much better.

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:59.360
[Amit Varma]: So the state capacity simply wasn't there. So this is not an either or situation, what

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:04.880
[Amit Varma]: people like you and you know, I wrote about it back at the time, you know, Shruti, Mihir,

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:09.360
[Amit Varma]: all of them were writing about it, what you really need is that the government goes on

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:14.560
[Amit Varma]: a war footing. And I use that phrase, with some thought behind it goes on a war footing

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:19.760
[Amit Varma]: against a virus and tries to vaccinate as many people as it can. But at the same time,

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:24.600
[Amit Varma]: you enable the private sector to do what it will import whatever vaccines it has to, and

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:30.320
[Amit Varma]: also get to work. One of the interesting nuances you pointed out there is that when the state

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.280
[Amit Varma]: is doing something, it will have these blunt heuristics that okay, who do we vaccinate

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:39.480
[Amit Varma]: first, the elderly are the most so first over 60, then over 45. And I was chatting the other

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:42.920
[Amit Varma]: day with our mutual friend Ruben Abraham, who threw the question that who should we

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:48.320
[Amit Varma]: vaccinate first, the vulnerable or the spreaders, the people most likely to spread. And if there

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:54.320
[Amit Varma]: is also a case to be made that he it's a spreaders who we need vaccinate as soon as possible,

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:58.680
[Amit Varma]: how do you get it done? If you are to make the case that, you know, people in the slums

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:02.400
[Amit Varma]: might already have some level of seroprevalence, and they've already got it as people in the

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:06.920
[Amit Varma]: high rises, the elites, who are now in fact, suffering the brunt of the second wave, who

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:10.720
[Amit Varma]: need to be protected, how do you do it? And the answer there is that you let them buy

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:16.280
[Amit Varma]: it, you let private providers get into play, companies will provide it for their employees,

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:20.120
[Amit Varma]: like you pointed out in one of your articles that why would an airline not say that all

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:25.200
[Amit Varma]: my frequent flyers will vaccinate them? You know, why would a cooperative housing society,

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:30.360
[Amit Varma]: which is today organising groceries at particular times during the lockdown, not say that, hey,

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:36.960
[Amit Varma]: we'll do a vaccine drive. And, and that never happened. And that is just so incredibly short

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:41.420
[Amit Varma]: sighted and sort of bizarre. Would you like to add to this?

01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:46.840
[Guest]: So I feel that from the viewpoint of public health, in some ideal world, we would say

01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:53.160
[Guest]: that it is our objective to put an end to this pandemic. And so we need to push hard

01:32:53.160 --> 01:33:01.080
[Guest]: on vaccination till the point where the disease dynamics changes and it will go away with

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:06.920
[Guest]: a whimper. So I agree with you completely on that. Whether you think about this in terms

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:14.500
[Guest]: of the justice and protecting the people and protecting rich and poor alike, or you think

01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:19.520
[Guest]: about this in terms of a pragmatic viewpoint saying, we're losing trillions of rupees in

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:24.400
[Guest]: this rubbish. And we should be willing to commit resources in order to solve this. So

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:30.040
[Guest]: I'm completely with you on this. I feel that where we went wrong in India was on a couple

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:36.040
[Guest]: of bottlenecks. The first was that somehow, and I have really not been able to understand

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:42.120
[Guest]: where this comes from. Somehow, the health policy community in India has accumulated

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:49.560
[Guest]: an idea that we must never import vaccines. So I don't know why. For the life of me, I'm

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:59.080
[Guest]: not able to understand. We import mobile phones, we import wristwatches, we import food, we

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:06.600
[Guest]: import clothes, we import everything under the sun today. But an old Nehruvian hostility

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:12.840
[Guest]: to import of vaccines is the order of the day when it comes to health policy people.

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:20.400
[Guest]: And it has proved to be an extremely costly blind spot. Things are so bad that I believe

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:29.440
[Guest]: there was an example, there was a situation where a global vaccine provider, who has been

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:35.760
[Guest]: greenlighted by drug safety authorities in many OECD countries, was actually denied permission

01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:41.400
[Guest]: in India on the grounds that their product is not safe. Now that doesn't make any sense.

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:46.160
[Guest]: So first of all, we have no great drug safety procedures in India to speak of. There's all

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:52.320
[Guest]: kinds of stuff that gets through. And, you know, it's not like we are more stringent

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:58.440
[Guest]: and that we run higher standards than what I've seen in some other countries. And yet,

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:05.760
[Guest]: was it some hostility to import of vaccines, where we actually closed the door on, I forget

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:12.960
[Guest]: the name, some foreign vaccine, just a couple of months ago, this little drama took place.

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:17.320
[Amit Varma]: So I think last year in October or something, Pfizer actually tried to come into India and

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:20.920
[Amit Varma]: the Indian government said, no, you have to do trials first. And they were like, forget

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:25.120
[Guest]: it, let's just go. So there is one, there's some blinkers in the field of health policy.

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:28.880
[Guest]: And this goes back to, you know, what I was saying earlier, that what we lack in India

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:33.960
[Guest]: is a health research community. We lack a health policy community. We've just got amateurs.

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:39.520
[Guest]: I mean, they're doctors. I want those people to cut open my ribcage when I have a heart

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:44.000
[Guest]: attack, but I don't want them to do health policy. This is a serious problem.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.680
[Amit Varma]: Trust me, after listening to this, they want to cut open your ribcage right now.

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:58.400
[Guest]: So there were certain blind spots on these kinds of questions. The second idea was that

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:04.720
[Guest]: I feel for too many people in India, in the policy process, there is not the elementary

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:13.920
[Guest]: care around state coercion. So for our thinking in public policy, we baseline on freedom.

01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:19.200
[Guest]: Our default setting is every human being is free and we should do as we like. And then

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:24.320
[Guest]: we checklist the nature of state coercion, that this is banned, this is banned, this

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.800
[Guest]: is banned. These are all the ways in which the state is coercing us. And we wonder why

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:31.960
[Guest]: do you have that coercion? Why do you have that coercion? Is there a market failure?

01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:36.440
[Guest]: Is this an effective coercion? Whereas what happened with the Indian state on vaccination

01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:43.080
[Guest]: was that there was a whole array of state coercion that was put into place without thinking

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:50.040
[Guest]: too much about whether that is justified or legitimate. And that may be the DNA of the

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:54.160
[Guest]: Indian state in many, many things. Maybe this is actually how things are being done all

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.920
[Guest]: across the place.

01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:03.200
[Guest]: So the lack of application of mind before coercing private people, I feel is what was

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:07.640
[Guest]: at fault. So almost without noticing it, there would be some junior functionary who would

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:14.160
[Guest]: put out an order to Serum Institute that we prohibit you from selling to any private person.

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:18.800
[Guest]: And then suddenly you got an environment where private persons are prohibited from importing,

01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:22.480
[Guest]: private persons are prohibited from buying from Serum. And then we are in the grip of

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:30.160
[Guest]: only one channel, that is the union government led immunization effort. And if it had worked,

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:33.040
[Guest]: great, but we were putting all our eggs in one basket.

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:39.360
[Guest]: So I think for all of us for the future, there are some larger meta lessons. And three meta

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:45.880
[Guest]: lessons that I would encourage us to think about is that we should consider it possible

01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:50.840
[Guest]: that there can be state failure. We should not put all our eggs in one basket. We should

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:55.360
[Guest]: always have many, many initiatives that seek to get the same thing done. And we should

01:37:55.360 --> 01:38:02.760
[Guest]: set a high bar for knowledge and certainty and consensus and democratic legitimacy before

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:10.120
[Guest]: we roll out state power that coerces people. But our default should be freedom, our baseline

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.120
[Guest]: should be freedom.

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:17.280
[Guest]: Just to take you to a sidetrack, imagine you're sitting in some corner of rural India, and

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:26.880
[Guest]: you spend $500 and you buy the base station equipment of Elon Musk's broadband internet

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:33.200
[Guest]: provider, which is called Starlink. And you get 100 MB per second to the internet. There's

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.000
[Guest]: no market failure, you're not harming anybody, you're all alone in a rural area. And you're

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.920
[Guest]: willing to pay $100 a month and you've got yourself nice, shiny broadband connectivity

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:45.040
[Guest]: into any corner of the country.

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.080
[Guest]: Your presumption should be, look, you're not harming anybody else, go do whatever the hell

01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:52.920
[Guest]: you want. Okay, so consenting adults should be free to do whatever they want. You are

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:58.880
[Guest]: paying $100 a month to Elon Musk, it should be free. But I suspect that by default, some

01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:04.200
[Guest]: Indian state employee right now is thinking, no, no, no, no, no, no. First, Starlink has

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:08.000
[Guest]: to come and take permission from me. Without that, they can't sell this product. So, I

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.520
[Guest]: feel that's the gap that we have to cross that the default should be freedom. And the

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:21.240
[Guest]: exception should be interference in freedom by state power. I'm not an expert on the Constitution

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:26.120
[Guest]: of India, but I believe there are some elements of the drafting of the Constitution that says

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:33.720
[Guest]: that in the land of the free in the Republic of India, freedom will be the default, other

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:39.200
[Guest]: than democratically authorized interference in freedom by the state. And it's very amusing

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:44.280
[Guest]: that there are some laws in India, which actually start right at the outset by flipping it around.

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:49.600
[Guest]: Laws that say first, everything is banned, other than what I permit. And here's a list

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:53.240
[Guest]: of narrow permissions that I give you. So, it's very interesting that the Parliament

01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:59.960
[Guest]: has actually flipped around the concept of constitutional freedom that was adopted by

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.840
[Guest]: the people after the Constituent Assembly.

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:08.040
[Amit Varma]: And that concept really didn't last long. Like I had a great episode on the First Amendment

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:12.600
[Amit Varma]: with Rupert Dumansingh, where you realize how right, you know, early at that time, everything

01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:16.160
[Amit Varma]: was getting flipped around, like the sedition law, which we have with us, such a terrible

01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:21.520
[Amit Varma]: colonial era law was actually struck down by the courts in 1950, if I remember correctly.

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:25.400
[Amit Varma]: And then Nehru brought it back with the First Amendment, because he wanted to handle his

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:30.200
[Amit Varma]: political enemies. So for all those who think of him as a sort of a great liberal, well,

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:35.600
[Amit Varma]: in some ways, he was because we contain multitudes, but in some ways, he was also deeply illiberal.

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:39.920
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned the phrase consenting adults. So I'll just kind of express a pet peeve of

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:44.840
[Amit Varma]: mine here is that many of us somehow seem to think correctly, that no one should, you

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:48.000
[Amit Varma]: know, interfere with what two consenting adults do with each other, as long as they're not

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.840
[Amit Varma]: harming anybody else in the domain of your home in the domain of your bedroom. So, you

01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:56.360
[Amit Varma]: know, if you and I are having a conversation, and we're not harming anyone in the government

01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:00.840
[Amit Varma]: barges in, we would correctly be outraged. But somehow, when it happens in the marketplace,

01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:05.240
[Amit Varma]: when two people are having an interaction to mutual benefit, and not harming anybody

01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:10.080
[Amit Varma]: else, then suddenly it's a government's business, and you will make all kinds of justifications

01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:16.360
[Amit Varma]: for it. And to me, you know, interfering there is as much morally wrong as it is otherwise.

01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:20.760
[Amit Varma]: And it is not that, you know, there should never be coercion, if you consider all coercion

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:27.000
[Amit Varma]: to be morally wrong, a little bit of coercion is necessary to safeguard our rights, which

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.600
[Amit Varma]: is why the state exists, but nothing beyond that. It's this really complicated thing where

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:36.280
[Amit Varma]: in our personal lives, if an individual came and did something to me, I would be outraged.

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.680
[Amit Varma]: But somehow the state has the right to do it. And we don't question that. And we don't

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:44.560
[Amit Varma]: think hard enough about it. But to sort of get back to the questions of vaccines, or

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.560
[Guest]: in fact, yeah, sorry.

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:50.840
[Guest]: So on vaccines, I want to complain to you and to me, and to all of us who are hearing

01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:58.880
[Guest]: this podcast. I'm aghast at how little all of us do as individuals on getting more vaccines.

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:03.280
[Guest]: Somehow, it is coming to our head that the government runs some smallpox vaccination

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:09.560
[Guest]: and some kids get vaccinated. And apart from that, vaccines are not part of our world.

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:16.240
[Guest]: And in my opinion, that's really a personal selfish mistake by each of us. Every boy and

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:22.060
[Guest]: girl at age 12 should get an HPV vaccine. It's in your self-interest. It may cost money,

01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:26.960
[Guest]: you should put down good money and get it and so on. So there are so many good vaccines

01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:30.700
[Guest]: that are available in the world today that will protect us. By the way, I only recently

01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:36.160
[Guest]: discovered that abroad, there is a good dengue vaccine. The next time I travel abroad, I

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:41.240
[Guest]: very much plan to get the dengue vaccine. It's not available in India, but it is available

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.740
[Guest]: abroad and so on.

01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:48.640
[Guest]: So I feel something went wrong in our thinking for all of us as a community, that we were

01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:53.120
[Guest]: not doing this hard headed first principles thinking about what's a public good, what's

01:42:53.120 --> 01:43:00.640
[Guest]: a private good, and I benefit when I get a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and I should be

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:05.520
[Guest]: willing to put a price to that. And we each of us can debate what am I willing to pay?

01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:10.000
[Guest]: And then it just becomes a normal marketplace and normal market forces will work where you

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.760
[Guest]: pay a little more to have somebody come administer the vaccine in your arm at your home, or you

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:20.120
[Guest]: pay a little more for an air-conditioned facility, you pay a little less for a facility that's

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:26.520
[Guest]: out in the open, blah, blah, blah. Just normal machinery of markets would do vaccines. And

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:30.920
[Guest]: I just fail to understand why that has not taken root on a bigger scale. And I would

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:35.480
[Guest]: plead to all of us that there are so many good vaccines out there, we should be getting

01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:40.200
[Guest]: these things. It's a free lunch. You spend some money on a vaccine, you rule out a disease

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:45.480
[Guest]: for X years, and we become healthier. It's a good deal. All of us should do it.

01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:50.280
[Amit Varma]: So you know, speaking of sort of free lunches, I think we both agree and I'm coming to you

01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:54.440
[Amit Varma]: know, a weird question with this, but I think we both agree that we should do regulatory

01:43:54.440 --> 01:44:00.200
[Amit Varma]: free rolling in the sense that by and large, I think for example, America's FDA is just

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.800
[Amit Varma]: over regulates massively and that has a cost and that's a subject for a different episode.

01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:09.880
[Amit Varma]: You can't get more stringent than that. European regulators also often overdo it, they're incredibly

01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:14.160
[Amit Varma]: stringent. So why the hell don't we free roll on the work that they put in when we don't

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:18.160
[Amit Varma]: have enough state capacity, if they have approved something, you know, we should just bring

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:22.040
[Amit Varma]: it in, it should be it should be an automatic approval, especially at a time like this,

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:26.960
[Amit Varma]: where you can't afford to wait. And this kind of vaccine nationalism, that

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:31.600
[Amit Varma]: nahi atma nirbhar and we will make it ourselves seems problematic to me. And it also strikes

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:36.120
[Amit Varma]: me that is there a danger you think and I'm thinking aloud here, that you can become a

01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:40.840
[Amit Varma]: slave to your own message. For example, if you are a government, which is always thinking

01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:46.160
[Amit Varma]: of narrative thinking of national pride, which is one of the, you know, core narrative elements

01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:50.520
[Amit Varma]: of this particular dispensation. And if you're always thinking in terms of core national

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:56.320
[Amit Varma]: pride, and out of that, among other things, emerges made in India emerges atma nirbhar,

01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:59.880
[Amit Varma]: then you become a slave to the message. So when you have a crisis like this, you are

01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:04.160
[Amit Varma]: still thinking made in India, you're still thinking atma nirbhar, not out of any deep

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:09.320
[Amit Varma]: belief, which is, you know, backed by either reasoning or data or anything like that. But

01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:13.440
[Amit Varma]: simply because that's part of the marketing narrative you made for yourself. And now your

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:18.240
[Amit Varma]: product has to fit that marketing. So do you think that there is a sort of reflexivity

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.200
[Guest]: and interplay here as well? A wise man once said that if you try to grab

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:28.000
[Guest]: for happiness, you will be unhappy. And the path to happiness lies in letting go and,

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.120
[Guest]: you know, living for some higher things and finding purpose in your life, and the happiness

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:36.640
[Guest]: will come. So if you become too desperate and chase and run the rat race, you're probably

01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:41.840
[Guest]: not going to be particularly happy. So in similar fashion, I think, great countries

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:47.360
[Guest]: wear it lightly. A great country becomes great almost for free without noticing. Whereas

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:52.560
[Guest]: if we try too hard to puff ourselves up and claim that we are great, then we're going

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:57.760
[Amit Varma]: to lose something essential in that process. Right. Let's kind of come back to the current

01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:02.480
[Amit Varma]: situation that on principles, we've agreed that this is what they should have done that,

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:06.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, the state does what it has to do. In fact, it goes on a war footing to try to

01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:10.800
[Amit Varma]: vaccinate as many people as it possibly can for free. But it also allows a private market

01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:14.200
[Amit Varma]: to do its own thing. And as you pointed out, that would mean instead of two vaccines, which

01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:18.600
[Amit Varma]: is becoming three, but instead of two or three, we'd probably have the whole array of them,

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:24.240
[Amit Varma]: which therefore, that greater diversity of vaccine also leads to a higher level of protection.

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:29.880
[Amit Varma]: Now, that didn't happen. Now, take me through the chronology, as it were, chronology, take

01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:35.000
[Amit Varma]: me through the chronology of what's been happening here with the Serum Institute, like one of

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.360
[Amit Varma]: the early things that we heard that they're going to offer the vaccine at 150 rupees to

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:45.200
[Amit Varma]: the government, but they were planning to sell it in private for 1000 bucks, which I

01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.080
[Amit Varma]: thought was perfectly acceptable, because many people like myself would happily have

01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:53.760
[Amit Varma]: paid that 1000. And they were going to plunge it back into building more capacity and sort

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:58.120
[Amit Varma]: of ramping it up. Because as you've pointed out, they need to make about two or three

01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:03.760
[Amit Varma]: times as many vaccines per day as they do now. And that excess capacity requires investment

01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:07.520
[Amit Varma]: and allowing them to sell it to private parties would have allowed for that. But that route

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:11.840
[Amit Varma]: was completely cut off. So take me a little bit through the chronology of what's been

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:16.320
[Amit Varma]: happening in the last four or five months, as far as the vaccinations are concerned.

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:22.000
[Guest]: So in late 2020, there was a debate around these things. And the decisions of the key

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:29.240
[Guest]: persons were that we will use state coercion, we will block imports, we will block private

01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:34.120
[Guest]: purchase from Serum Institute, all the output that Serum Institute sells in India shall

01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:38.920
[Guest]: be sold only to the union government. And only the union government will go all around

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:44.320
[Guest]: the country, delivering the vaccine doses through state governments and hospitals and

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:49.720
[Guest]: other facilities. And there will be only one IT system called Coven, which will harvest

01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:57.720
[Guest]: your data as well. And this is the union government led vaccination programme that was built.

01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:04.040
[Guest]: By April, it was becoming clear that this had not worked out too well. The New York

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:12.560
[Guest]: Times has a tracker where you can go and compare the work of alternative countries. And I remember,

01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:18.160
[Guest]: when I wrote an article about this a short while ago, you could sort the list of countries

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:23.960
[Guest]: by the fraction of the population that has got two doses. And India was at 1.2%. And

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:30.280
[Guest]: this was ranked 62 in the world. And this was particularly unlucky, given the fact that

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:35.040
[Guest]: India was supposed to be one of the world's great manufacturers of vaccines. So this was

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:40.120
[Guest]: a case where we could start to see that in the Indian private sector, there was a production

01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:47.400
[Guest]: capability, namely Serum Institute, which had the business and intellectual genius of

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:52.920
[Guest]: understanding that there was a story going on here of finding a contract with AstraZeneca

01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:54.160
[Guest]: and Oxford University.

01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:59.320
[Guest]: So I feel we claim that it is an Indian vaccine. It is half true. There is a manufacturing

01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:04.600
[Guest]: facility here in India. But honestly, credit where it is due, it was AstraZeneca and Oxford

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:09.720
[Guest]: University that developed the vaccine. And Serum Institute had the smarts to contract

01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:16.600
[Guest]: with them. And they were able to build a reasonable production capacity. And the remainder of

01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:21.920
[Guest]: health policy broke down. So the remainder of health policy was not able to solve this

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:22.920
[Guest]: puzzle correctly.

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:28.280
[Guest]: So they were presented with a jigsaw puzzle in late 2020. They were given a choice between

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:34.400
[Guest]: three alternative pathways, and they chose the wrong room in the house. And so by April,

01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:41.160
[Guest]: it was becoming clear that these choices had not worked out. Then I think on 17th April

01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:49.440
[Guest]: or 19th April, there were a batch of decisions where I feel in significant part, they are

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:56.400
[Guest]: on the right track. And I want to carefully describe what was done. And I also want to

01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:04.040
[Guest]: defend what was done, because there is a certain kind of sentiment in the country that is unhappy

01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:09.160
[Guest]: with this work in a way that I personally think is unfair. And I feel we need to grapple

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:13.960
[Guest]: with that debate also. And at the same time, in this position, there are certain elements

01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:17.000
[Guest]: of state coercion that I think just don't make sense.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.360
[Guest]: So what were these announcements? Step one, they said that organizations other than the

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:29.200
[Guest]: union government are now allowed to have their own energy and think about vaccination. So

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:35.160
[Guest]: please note, banning is the norm and freedom is the exception. So now the government has

01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:42.800
[Guest]: given you the freedom that Amit Verma can organize the club of guests that have ever

01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:48.760
[Guest]: appeared on the scene and the unseen and we can run a vaccination party at Shivaji Park.

01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:53.520
[Guest]: So that you now have the permission to do that if you should so decide. Element two,

01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:58.440
[Guest]: you are free to import vaccines for that purpose. So state governments and private persons are

01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:03.720
[Guest]: now free to import vaccines for the first time. That freedom is now given to private

01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:07.080
[Guest]: persons. And I think all this is good.

01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:14.160
[Guest]: Next, they have a remarkable set of industrial policy and central planning rules upon vaccine

01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:21.520
[Guest]: makers in India. So they say, whatever Serum makes, 50% of that shall be sold to me, without

01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:28.120
[Guest]: mention to the price. And out of the remaining 50%, Serum is able to sell to state governments

01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:33.520
[Guest]: or private people and they leave that question intact. Alongside that, there was supposed

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:40.080
[Guest]: to be a lot of informal pressure by the government upon Serum. Now I have no idea. I'm just reporting

01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:45.600
[Guest]: newspaper stories. So in the end, Serum Institute came out with a formula where they said that

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:51.320
[Guest]: we will sell to the union government at 150 rupees and state governments at 400 rupees

01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:55.600
[Guest]: and private people at 600 rupees. And I think yesterday or the day before they announced

01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:00.640
[Guest]: that for state governments, we'll bring it down from 400 rupees to 300 rupees. And none

01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:07.040
[Guest]: of these are market-based decisions. So we have an old idea in economics that there should

01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:11.000
[Guest]: be a law of one price. Everything should be traded at one single price, partly because

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.480
[Guest]: now you're needlessly creating a black market and partly because you're getting the wrong

01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:21.400
[Guest]: incentives that Serum will only respond to the marginal price and these constraints that

01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:25.600
[Guest]: if they increase capacity, half of it will go to the union government at a low price

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:35.000
[Guest]: that messes with the gains to Serum from increasing their capacity. So that's where we are.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:40.880
[Guest]: Alongside all this, we have to worry that in the short term, vaccine manufacturing is

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:47.240
[Guest]: not easy to change quickly. So the short term price elasticity is low, but in the medium

01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:54.000
[Guest]: term, the price elasticity will show up. So in time, the global manufacturers and the

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:59.080
[Guest]: Indian manufacturers will respond and will produce more when price signals come. But

01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:05.600
[Guest]: as long as the price signals don't come, we will not get higher quantities into India.

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:12.080
[Guest]: So I would love to campaign and I would love to make T-shirts and sell them, which say

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:16.840
[Guest]: that supply curve slope upwards, that if you pay a higher price, you get bigger quantities.

01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:22.160
[Guest]: It's a revolutionary insight. If you think there's not enough vaccine in India, pay more.

01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:25.520
[Guest]: It's a revolutionary idea that by paying more, you can get larger quantities.

01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Right. You know, we'll go to the positive implications of these and there are many.

01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:35.040
[Amit Varma]: But first, the continuation of a certain kind of coercion also has negative implications.

01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:40.720
[Amit Varma]: And that leads me to a question like one point that you have, for example, made is that,

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:44.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, foreign companies are at this moment nervous about coming to India, nervous about

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:49.320
[Amit Varma]: coming here because they don't know what is the legal risk? How is the regulatory environment

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:54.920
[Amit Varma]: going to change? Will price controls come? You know, in all of this uncertainty to actually

01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:59.280
[Amit Varma]: invest in anything becomes a problem. Now, my question is this that when we just look

01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:04.780
[Amit Varma]: at the Serum Institute, I think both you and I should agree that they should be allowed

01:54:04.780 --> 01:54:09.960
[Amit Varma]: to make a reasonable profit and the government should just pump whatever money it can, because

01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:15.080
[Amit Varma]: one, it is the state's imperative to just vaccinate as many people as fast as possible

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:16.080
[Amit Varma]: and just pay for it.

01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:20.320
[Amit Varma]: And people who can pay for themselves can but otherwise just pay for it. And also serum

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:23.760
[Amit Varma]: should be you know, mess around too much with oh, they are making so much profit. But the

01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:29.840
[Amit Varma]: problem still comes up is that what are the heuristics that we then apply to arrive at

01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:34.360
[Amit Varma]: what the right price is? For example, there is no market, right? There is no supply and

01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:40.200
[Amit Varma]: demand and it doesn't even apply here because we agree that it needs to be done nevertheless.

01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:44.440
[Amit Varma]: So what is the right price like people are complaining about 150 600 400 they got a lot

01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:48.880
[Amit Varma]: of mockery for saying they're coming down from 400 to 300 for philanthropic reasons,

01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:53.320
[Amit Varma]: which was a badly worded tweet, I would say, how can we decide like, for example, if serum

01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:57.480
[Amit Varma]: was to say 2000 per dose to the government, obviously, that would be a little bit ridiculous.

01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:02.360
[Amit Varma]: And even if we agree the state should spend whatever is required, that would be completely

01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:06.280
[Amit Varma]: ridiculous. At the same time to say that give it at cost price, if they were to say that

01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:10.160
[Amit Varma]: whatever that cost price is, would also be ridiculous, because then you're changing the

01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:14.880
[Amit Varma]: incentives completely. And in a future pandemic, we could be even worse prepared because they

01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:19.680
[Amit Varma]: would not have ramped up their capacity and so on and so forth. So what possible heuristic

01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:24.120
[Amit Varma]: can there be? Because it seems to me that there is now in the mind of the common person,

01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:28.280
[Amit Varma]: frankly, even in my mind, this just seems like some kind of absurd drama that I'm giving

01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:33.480
[Amit Varma]: to someone at 150, someone at 300, someone at 600, like what the hell is going on?

01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:40.360
[Guest]: Yeah, if serum was the only manufacturer of this vaccine in the whole world, then the

01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:46.040
[Guest]: market failure would be market power. And then we would be singing the language that

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:51.000
[Guest]: here's a monopolist, they're restricting output and jacking up the price. And we'd be thinking

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:56.320
[Guest]: about, you know, a competition commission class of remedies on how to deal with that

01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:01.960
[Guest]: problem. Okay, and it's a tricky problem. It's a difficult problem. Luckily, we are

01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:09.880
[Guest]: actually at an extremely sensible place today, that today, there are an array of choices

01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:16.240
[Guest]: in the world market for vaccines. So serum is absolutely not a monopoly. So let me just

01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:21.640
[Guest]: run through a sense of the market. So you'll see what is there, there is a one dose Johnson

01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:26.360
[Guest]: and Johnson vaccine, please note, it's very convenient for remote rural India, only one

01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:32.680
[Guest]: dose. Then there is Pfizer and Moderna, which have a problem that they require cryogenic

01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:37.280
[Guest]: cold chain, but it's very solvable. India is a big enough rich enough country that the

01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:43.160
[Guest]: customer can absorb all these costs. I will say number four is AstraZeneca, because there

01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:47.760
[Guest]: are actually many, many ways in which AstraZeneca stuff is being made all over the world. Serum

01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:53.480
[Guest]: is not the monopoly, serum is not the only AstraZeneca vaccine. And my tentative fifth

01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:59.760
[Guest]: is Sputnik, the Russian vaccine. While there are some concerns about their testing results,

01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:09.640
[Guest]: and while no advanced economy has as yet licensed Sputnik, my opinion and my hearsay from good

01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:15.680
[Guest]: scientists is that Sputnik is a decent vaccine, which is not what I would say about the Chinese

01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:21.600
[Guest]: vaccine where things are much less exciting. It does protect, but it protects less than

01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:27.200
[Guest]: at least these five. So, there are at least five significant vaccine players in the world

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:33.440
[Guest]: today, and they respond to business imperatives. So, I believe one of them was told by India

01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:37.680
[Guest]: that we will not license you. So, we will not allow you to sell in India. Similarly,

01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:42.440
[Guest]: some of them are going to say that you need to protect us from some kinds of liability.

01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:49.320
[Guest]: And again, we need to align with international norms and frameworks that if a vaccine is

01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:53.120
[Guest]: licensed for emergency use, and then there are some adverse events, you need to have

01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:58.120
[Guest]: some concept of product liability that generates a meaningful level of risk for the corporation

01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:01.440
[Guest]: and not have crazy levels of risk for the corporation. I do not know what the answer

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:06.400
[Guest]: is. I will just say, we should align with what the great economies of the world do,

01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:12.640
[Guest]: so as to make all the five compete in the Indian market. At the end of that competition,

01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:17.320
[Guest]: I will shut up and accept the price. If it says 5,000 rupees, I will say fine. If it

01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:22.680
[Guest]: says 5 rupees, I will say fine. I will not try to have a judgment on what is the price

01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:29.200
[Guest]: over and beyond what a competitive market of at least five players is saying today.

01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:34.440
[Guest]: And we are not done, because it is not the end at five. There are other vaccine projects

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:39.600
[Guest]: that are coming. There is one called Novovax, who also has a manufacturing contract with

01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:44.480
[Guest]: Serum Institute in Pune. So, that is at least one-sixth, where by all accounts, it did reasonably

01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:52.440
[Guest]: well in their trials. So, there were 150 projects that began on trying to build vaccines for

01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:59.240
[Guest]: SARS-CoV-2. And every day, more projects are reaching the finish line in terms of approvals,

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:05.280
[Guest]: in terms of launches of manufacturing capacity, and the price will come down. So, I would

01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:09.640
[Guest]: just like to say at this point, I do not think that there is a market failure. It is a business.

01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:13.280
[Guest]: You should negotiate. Multiple people should negotiate. I do not think it should only be

01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:21.680
[Guest]: the Indian state. I would like the Amit Verma club of guests to negotiate for 45 doses.

01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:25.640
[Guest]: And you know, we should meet up at Shivaji Park and we should get doses into our arm.

01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:30.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that is a realistic plan. I am actually going to try and get 45 doses and call my

01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:34.320
[Amit Varma]: guests. I have had many more than 45 guests. But I think you have been on enough episodes

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:39.880
[Amit Varma]: that if we just go by frequency, you will qualify as one of the 45 people to get whatever

01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:47.040
[Amit Varma]: vaccine this is seen unseen vaccine. Let's quickly talk about the implications. And,

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:50.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, I'll again quote from what you have written here. And of course, I link all these

01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:57.000
[Amit Varma]: pieces in the show notes. And at one point, you write as one of the possible implications

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:02.400
[Amit Varma]: of allowing private persons and state governments to import vaccines is quote, the private sector

02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:07.080
[Amit Varma]: will surprise us with innovation and business models, billing arrangements, etc. Perhaps

02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:12.160
[Amit Varma]: some firms will find it easier to deliver the one dose J&J vaccine in difficult locations.

02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:15.760
[Amit Varma]: Perhaps telecom companies will call their vast subscriber base and sell vaccination

02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:20.720
[Amit Varma]: services. Private firms know how to segment the users into a large number of categories

02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:25.120
[Amit Varma]: and device strategies for each of them. This is what a union government which solves for

02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:30.720
[Amit Varma]: one use case is ill suited for stop code. And it seems to me that this is what we really

02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:35.720
[Amit Varma]: need because the science is sorted. It's miraculous that we've come up with so many vaccines which

02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:39.680
[Amit Varma]: work in so many different ways. And the science is sorted where we are stuck is with the delivery

02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:45.040
[Amit Varma]: mechanism that the vaccines aren't enough, we need to do vaccinations. And part of that

02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:49.000
[Amit Varma]: is, of course, making people agree to take the vaccines. And there is a lot of vaccine

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:53.960
[Amit Varma]: skepticism still out there, which just kind of baffles me. But apart from that, the delivery

02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:59.680
[Amit Varma]: is one issue where you know, the state capacity has been lacking in different ways. And here,

02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:04.220
[Amit Varma]: you are just allowing disruptors and innovators to get into the space and innovate. And this

02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:09.360
[Amit Varma]: has a knockoff effect for the future. Because when we are hit with a pandemic again, or

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:13.920
[Amit Varma]: we have any other kind of health care crisis, or just in the normal course of how health

02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:18.520
[Amit Varma]: care is delivered in the country, there will be processes and ways that will evolve out

02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:23.280
[Amit Varma]: of this, which are beyond the conception or imagination of any central planner. So even

02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:26.800
[Amit Varma]: more than the current imperative that hey, we need to get as many people vaccinated as

02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:32.000
[Amit Varma]: possible. There are these knock on effects. So is this going to happen now that the government

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.040
[Amit Varma]: has said yeah, it can happen? Is this sort of the great hope which will at least help

02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:37.860
[Guest]: us avoid the third wave?

02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:43.000
[Guest]: So are we there yet? We're not yet there because of some problems. One is the question of legal

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.440
[Guest]: liabilities where foreign vendors are still nervous about coming into India. Second is

02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:53.720
[Guest]: about the risk of price controls coming from the Indian government. And this could include

02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:58.560
[Guest]: the judiciary. I believe there is one case in the Kerala High Court, one case in the

02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:04.400
[Guest]: Bombay High Court, one case in the Supreme Court, where various private people are telling

02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:09.520
[Guest]: a story about socialism and the rights of every single Indian citizen and demanding

02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:14.520
[Guest]: that the price control should be either rupees 150 or zero. And if these kinds of things

02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:20.240
[Guest]: come, then again, you've killed it. So it is not yet done. We are not yet there in terms

02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:26.560
[Guest]: of a world of private hunger and innovation, giving you a self-organizing system that will

02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:31.760
[Guest]: figure out vaccine delivery in a way that no government can possibly do.

02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:38.240
[Guest]: But as you said, the essence of it is, can we bring the energy, the creativity, the innovation

02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:44.600
[Guest]: of the Indian consumer goods companies into this? Because they know how to reach users.

02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:49.800
[Guest]: They know how to reach families. They know how to touch the heartstrings of a mom. They

02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:55.200
[Guest]: know how to segment consumers into different, different regions with different, different

02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:00.840
[Guest]: behaviors and cultural characteristics, that the vaccine jingle in Tamil Nadu will be different

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:06.120
[Guest]: from the vaccine jingle in Kerala or within Kerala, how you talk to a Palakkad Iyer will

02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:09.080
[Guest]: be different from how you talk to a Marthomite and so on.

02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:13.600
[Guest]: So that is what private people do. They will think once it's a business, there will be

02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:19.000
[Guest]: opportunities and they will find ways to deliver it, which we can't think of. So, if somebody

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:24.520
[Guest]: challenges us and says that, okay, the union government tried this, it didn't work, how

02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:30.080
[Guest]: would you do it differently? My humble answer would be, I don't know. I'm not better than

02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:34.880
[Guest]: the civil servants trying to run a state-led system. I mean, they tried. They tried to

02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:40.360
[Guest]: design a program and they've got some IT system. They want to monopolize the information and

02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:46.560
[Guest]: they want to run it. I don't have improvements upon them in figuring out how to run a state-led

02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:53.960
[Guest]: system backed by coercion. But the point is that, that system has not worked well. And

02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:59.240
[Guest]: in my humble opinion, cannot and will not work well, because India is so diverse that

02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:05.600
[Guest]: any one union government scheme, even if it is done optimally, will hit a certain narrow

02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:10.640
[Guest]: target audience and will not reach a large base of the population. The Indian population

02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:16.520
[Guest]: is so diverse, you need the genius of the Indian private sector to segment, segment,

02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:20.440
[Guest]: segment, and differentiate and come up with different kinds of products and to surprise

02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:27.840
[Guest]: us in how this was done. To give you a telecom analogy, all of us remember how when mobile

02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:32.680
[Guest]: phones first came, they were at 16 rupees a minute, and they were a status symbol for

02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:38.080
[Guest]: the page three people. And at the time, the Indian government was running a village telephone

02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:43.120
[Guest]: scheme where they were trying to get one pay phone into every village. And by the time

02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:50.080
[Guest]: the consumer marketing people were done with this, we had a billion phones in India, and

02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:55.120
[Guest]: we have innovations like giving 25 rupees of a top up at every panwala in India and

02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:59.200
[Guest]: putting it into a phone. This is something no central planner could have imagined and

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:04.880
[Guest]: had not happened anywhere else in the world. This was just Indian grassroots innovation

02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:09.840
[Guest]: where people close to the ground looked at their world and figured out novel solutions.

02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:16.320
[Guest]: And I feel this is what private people can do if given a chance. I just want to underline

02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:23.200
[Guest]: how we should not view the present vaccination problem as a one-off. The first reason for

02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:30.680
[Guest]: this is that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not standing still, and there are variants and there will

02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:37.080
[Guest]: be new variants in the future. So far, the situation seems promising that generally,

02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:44.000
[Guest]: the vaccines as known today, fare well in the research papers against the variants as

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:49.320
[Guest]: seen today, barring one paper which has some bad news on a vaccine developed against the

02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:54.680
[Guest]: Wuhan variant and tested against a South African variant. Generally, these old vaccines are

02:05:54.680 --> 02:06:01.440
[Guest]: faring well. In particular, the B.1.1.7, which is the most studied dangerous variant is reasonably

02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:09.040
[Guest]: blocked by Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca. So, so far, things are looking good, but we should

02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:14.280
[Guest]: plan that the virus will fight back. There will be new variants in the future. So, when

02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:19.480
[Guest]: the variants come in the future, we will need booster doses. And so, again, establishing

02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:24.840
[Guest]: a large-scale distribution strategy to get booster doses out in a hurry is required.

02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:30.120
[Guest]: And that problem is harder than where we are today. Today, a lot of India has got seroprevalence.

02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:34.280
[Guest]: So, by now, a lot of people in India have got immunity through the disease because we've

02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:40.720
[Guest]: been living in this nightmare for 13 months. When a new variant comes through, which requires

02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:46.040
[Guest]: a booster dose, we'd much rather go through, you know, 13 weeks of rolling out a booster

02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:50.600
[Guest]: all over India, rather than going through a disease experience all over again. So, this

02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:56.600
[Guest]: is a very important reason why we must lay long-term institutional foundations of a private

02:06:56.600 --> 02:07:02.280
[Guest]: led business, where vaccines are going all around India and we normalize vaccines as

02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:08.360
[Guest]: part of our life, so that as and when the variants come, we are more ready for that.

02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:15.680
[Guest]: I want to note in passing that if India is a Covishield, namely AstraZeneca vaccine monoculture,

02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:19.200
[Guest]: then we are more fragile because a variant comes along which is able to break through

02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:24.720
[Guest]: against that one vaccine and suddenly the whole country is in trouble. Whereas, in the

02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:28.560
[Guest]: self-organizing system, in a more private led system, where there are many different

02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:34.440
[Guest]: vaccines, it's a more robust design. The market economy always comes up with a more robust

02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:38.600
[Guest]: design. It's not a monoculture, it's a polyculture, but there are many, many vaccines. So, any

02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:42.640
[Guest]: one variant will knock out some people, but will not bring the entire country down on

02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:47.400
[Guest]: its knees at one time. So, this is one more important reason to have a vaccine polyculture

02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:51.640
[Guest]: that would come inevitably out of a private led model, where there are many, many private

02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:56.960
[Guest]: people shopping in the world market for many different vaccines. And we just allow that

02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:00.760
[Guest]: to proceed, it will automatically generate many different vaccines.

02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:05.080
[Guest]: The last point I would like to make on this is in continuation of what I said a while

02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:08.960
[Guest]: ago. Actually, for all of us in India, we need to normalize vaccination as a part of

02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:14.520
[Guest]: our everyday life, because there is a great array of wonderful adult vaccines that are

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:19.080
[Guest]: out there. And there's just something that's gone wrong in our heads ever since the smallpox

02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:24.000
[Guest]: program that we tend to think the government does vaccination or that infants do vaccination.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:28.440
[Guest]: But we don't do vaccination. I think we adults need to be doing far more vaccination.

02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:32.720
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit more about just this point, like what are the adult vaccines? And, you

02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:36.000
[Amit Varma]: know, what would you recommend to me and all the adult listeners of this that we should

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.360
[Amit Varma]: just go out and get now?

02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:42.800
[Guest]: I'm not an expert on the science of it. Here are two examples off the top of my head. There

02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:49.000
[Guest]: is a flu vaccine, which is refreshed every year by the US CDC. Vijay Khelkar's daughter,

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.560
[Guest]: who has a PhD in the subject, said to me that every time you go to America, you should get

02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:57.640
[Guest]: a flu shot, because that gives you a refreshed flu vaccine every year. And then for about

02:08:57.640 --> 02:09:01.400
[Guest]: a year, you're immune to the flu. So that's like one less thing to think about. And the

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:05.040
[Guest]: flu is a significant threat for all of us. And it's good to rule that out. That's one

02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:10.440
[Guest]: example. I narrated another example. Dengue is actually a disease where there's a decent

02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:14.440
[Guest]: vaccine that is there in the world. It's just not there in India for whatever reasons. And

02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:20.080
[Guest]: again, if there is enough of a private market, maybe dengue vaccine import, maybe even manufacturing

02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:24.720
[Guest]: at some point, will come to India. For all of us, there are four variants of dengue.

02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:28.880
[Guest]: It is likely that most of us have not had dengue four times. So we are vulnerable to

02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:33.800
[Guest]: one or more of those strains. And it would just be fabulous to rule out dengue fever

02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:39.660
[Guest]: as one more thing that you need to think about. But the most exciting stuff is in the future.

02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:44.320
[Guest]: The most exciting stuff is the incredible improvements in vaccine science that happened

02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:50.060
[Guest]: because of SARS-CoV-2. So in the run for vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, we have understood so much

02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:59.240
[Guest]: more about the nature of pathogens and vaccines. We may get a vaccine against many cancers

02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:04.600
[Guest]: by going down the route of mRNA technology. We may get a vaccine against HIV, which has

02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:10.680
[Guest]: been a holy grail since the 80s. And all in all, the giant effort to get a vaccine against

02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:17.000
[Guest]: HIV has failed till today. But now, finally, with the mRNA technology, there is new hope

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:23.080
[Guest]: that an HIV vaccine might work out. Just a few weeks ago, a large-scale trial for a malaria

02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:29.320
[Guest]: vaccine generated 77% effectiveness. So there is actually fabulous stuff that is going on

02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:33.400
[Guest]: with vaccines. And there are at least five or ten others that I am not able to rattle

02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:38.520
[Guest]: out right now because it is not my field. But I have it on authority from people whose

02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:43.320
[Guest]: scientific understanding is better than mine that there is a large area of adult vaccines

02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:47.440
[Guest]: that are available both in India and abroad. And somehow, we in India have just shut our

02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:52.000
[Guest]: eyes to it, partly because we are in this notion that, oh, the government does everything.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.640
[Guest]: So there is some weird concept that vaccination is a responsibility of the government. And

02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:02.880
[Guest]: the government, of course, inadequately does a measly 25 million infants and 30 million

02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:07.640
[Guest]: moms per year. And for the rest, the government does nothing about adults. So we are in a

02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:13.920
[Guest]: trap. And I think we, the people, need to break out of that. And for that, the energy

02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:20.560
[Guest]: in a completely private, market-led framework, where we view a vaccine as a public good with

02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:25.200
[Guest]: an externality, maybe some voucherizing, is a logical way to proceed.

02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:29.200
[Amit Varma]: Fabulous. Many strands in there. And in one sense, in the leaps in medical technology

02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:33.920
[Amit Varma]: that COVID-19 sort of catalyzed, you know, some of it is mind-blowing, like the mRNA

02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:37.920
[Amit Varma]: vaccine, the fact that, you know, you had the genome sequenced and the vaccine basically

02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:42.680
[Amit Varma]: designed in a computer as far back as January last year. It's just mind-blowing.

02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:49.160
[Guest]: On 16th of Jan or something, a Chinese scientist uploaded the genetic sequence for the Wuhan

02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:54.560
[Guest]: strain of SARS-CoV-2. On the 17th of Jan, the software had been run inside Moderna and

02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:56.240
[Guest]: they had the vaccine designed.

02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:02.440
[Amit Varma]: Magical, mind-blowing. I mean, it's just incredible. And aside, you were speaking of, you know,

02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:06.360
[Amit Varma]: delivery. And if you look at what the US did, it's still straight run, but you can go to

02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:09.960
[Amit Varma]: a pharmacy and get it, you can go to a Walmart and get it, you can go to all these places

02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:10.960
[Amit Varma]: and get it.

02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:15.040
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, like we can get a mobile recharge at a Paanwala, who knows where we could get

02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:18.720
[Amit Varma]: the vaccine for cancer whenever it's developed. I mean, obviously, there are questions of

02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:23.640
[Amit Varma]: trust and all. And, you know, the overall point that society can solve its own problems

02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:29.120
[Amit Varma]: most of the time is something that I just agree with so overwhelmingly.

02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:33.400
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, being an 80s kid who then saw liberalisation and saw what it did and all

02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:38.360
[Amit Varma]: of that, you have examples of that which are so stark. I mean, back in the 80s, it took

02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:45.600
[Amit Varma]: you five years to get a freaking phone and, you know, look at how things are now. I want

02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:51.160
[Amit Varma]: to touch on, I think, one other major theme. And I want to go off on a little bit of a

02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:56.560
[Amit Varma]: rant here, because I think most people just don't get it. And it's tragic, because, which

02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:01.640
[Amit Varma]: is price controls. And the thing is, we need to understand price controls a little bit

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:06.160
[Amit Varma]: better, because I think a fundamental mistake many of us make when it comes to public policy

02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:11.400
[Amit Varma]: is we confuse intention for outcome. And so many public policies are sort of judged on

02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:15.640
[Amit Varma]: the basis of their intentions that, oh, the labour laws protect workers, and this law

02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:20.600
[Amit Varma]: does this. And I think one of the classic example of a law like that, that has really

02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:25.280
[Amit Varma]: bad outcomes, but great intentions are price controls. So a quick thought experiment for

02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:29.760
[Amit Varma]: my listeners, what if the government was to come and say tomorrow, that listen, why should

02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:34.240
[Amit Varma]: only the rich have cars, everybody should have cars. And to enable that we are putting

02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:38.760
[Amit Varma]: a price control on cars, cars should be available only for 1000 rupees. What do you think would

02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:43.240
[Amit Varma]: happen? Basically, what would happen is over a period of time after the existing cars are

02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:47.560
[Amit Varma]: gone, there would be no cars because you cannot make a car for 1000 rupees. Similarly, let's

02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:52.440
[Amit Varma]: say you set a more realistic tag of five lakhs and say anything beyond that is luxury, you

02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:56.560
[Amit Varma]: would have a certain category of cars which you can profitably sell for five lakhs, but

02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:02.680
[Amit Varma]: you won't have luxury cars or SUVs or whatever, as the case may be. In each case, the price

02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:06.920
[Amit Varma]: control would have led to a shortage that happens with everything. Now there are sort

02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:10.520
[Amit Varma]: of two effects which price controls have one is the short term effect of a shortage and

02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:15.000
[Amit Varma]: the other has to do with incentives. I like to illustrate that by talking about Uber search

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:20.420
[Amit Varma]: pricing. So bear with me while I kind of quickly go through that. Let's say that, you know,

02:14:20.420 --> 02:14:25.520
[Amit Varma]: you hit the app, and there are 100 drivers and there are 100 customers who are on the

02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:30.000
[Amit Varma]: app at that particular point in time, simplistic example, what will happen is that everybody

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:35.560
[Amit Varma]: gets a cab and they do whatever. Now let's say that there are 100 cabs and 300 customers.

02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:40.120
[Amit Varma]: If you don't have search pricing, if it becomes a first come first serve, and then you know

02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:46.120
[Amit Varma]: 100 people get their cabs, but 200 people are kind of left out in the cold, you know,

02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:49.840
[Amit Varma]: somebody may have to catch a flight urgently in post COVID times, of course, somebody may

02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:54.920
[Amit Varma]: need to go to the hospital urgently. And they can't do that. Well, some of the 100 who would

02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:58.800
[Amit Varma]: have gotten that cab in the first come first serve, maybe maybe they could have walked,

02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:02.500
[Amit Varma]: maybe they could have done something else, it wasn't so urgent for them. So you're allocating

02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:06.960
[Amit Varma]: only on the basis of who kind of got there first. Now, here's what search pricing does,

02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:12.520
[Amit Varma]: it does two things, it ensures that you know, the price accurately reflects the demand of

02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:16.720
[Amit Varma]: that particular thing. So if I just want to go nearby in the neighborhood, I might think,

02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:20.280
[Amit Varma]: hey, I'll just take an auto instead of paying so much, or I'll just take a whatever but

02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:24.360
[Amit Varma]: somebody who wants to go to the hospital wants to go to the airport actually has the option

02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:29.520
[Amit Varma]: of doing that. And the shortage isn't quite there because the price keeps adjusting. That's

02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:35.200
[Amit Varma]: the immediate short term impact of a price control, where price controls create shortages.

02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:38.420
[Amit Varma]: In fact, when Uber search pricing was banned in Delhi, a friend of mine missed a flight

02:15:38.420 --> 02:15:43.160
[Amit Varma]: because he couldn't find an Uber to get to the airport. So this kind of literally happened

02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:46.720
[Amit Varma]: after the Chennai floods happened, people were criticizing the airlines for raising

02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:50.520
[Amit Varma]: their prices and all of that. But the bottom line is that what would have happened if they

02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:54.920
[Amit Varma]: didn't raise their prices first come first serve and a bunch of people kind of get stranded.

02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:58.880
[Amit Varma]: This is only the short immediate impact shortages, there is a deeper long term impact, which

02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:03.560
[Amit Varma]: is more problematic. What happens when a price goes up, a price carries information, it is

02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:08.880
[Amit Varma]: a signal when a price goes up like in Uber, when a price goes up, there might be drivers

02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:12.920
[Amit Varma]: who are sitting inactive, who might say, hey, you know, I can have my lunch later, let me

02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:18.600
[Amit Varma]: make some money now. And they go out and they serve the need of the person to a mutual benefit.

02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:24.520
[Amit Varma]: The supply goes up when you allow the price to express what the demand actually is. And

02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:29.840
[Amit Varma]: we and we saw this play out earlier, when the government put a price control on stands.

02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:32.920
[Amit Varma]: And the moment that came out, I remember tweeting that, you know, we know where this is going

02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:37.640
[Amit Varma]: to go, there will be shortages, and there were shortages. And those shortages necessarily

02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:41.240
[Amit Varma]: would have cost a life somewhere or the other because someone who needed a stand couldn't

02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:45.840
[Amit Varma]: get one. But more than that, there is the unseen effect of that information of the rising

02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:50.920
[Amit Varma]: price not going out the information being that hey, people need this, make it somebody

02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:55.780
[Amit Varma]: make it that information simply doesn't go out there. And this is another reason why

02:16:55.780 --> 02:17:00.440
[Amit Varma]: I think price controls when it comes to vaccines would be incredibly dangerous, especially

02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:05.300
[Amit Varma]: in a competitive marketplace. Like you pointed out, there are sort of so many competitors.

02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:09.320
[Amit Varma]: So one, do you have anything to add to this something that I might have missed or a nuance

02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:14.880
[Amit Varma]: that you'd like to add? And, and two, why is this mindset still so pervasive and almost

02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:20.080
[Amit Varma]: reflexive among policymakers, where, you know, you always want to signal your intention with

02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:23.760
[Amit Varma]: a particular law, and you don't give a damn about what the outcome might be.

02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:28.840
[Guest]: So I want to add two things to this. The first is that holding other things constant, we

02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:34.920
[Guest]: read that serum faces constraints because of shortages of some particular components.

02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:42.080
[Guest]: Okay, and it is obvious that paying more money would help. If serum got a higher price for

02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:45.480
[Guest]: the vaccine, they will be willing to pay a higher price for that component, they will

02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:51.120
[Guest]: go somewhere on the world market by that component rationale, some other buyer for that component.

02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:54.720
[Guest]: And in the short term, there will be a supply response as a consequence of a higher price.

02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:59.320
[Guest]: So that's the first point that high prices will have a small impact, even in the short

02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:05.400
[Guest]: term, it's not as if assembly lines are fixed. So my experience with corporations and my

02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:10.560
[Guest]: observation of corporations is that there are actually many, many fudge factors that

02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:15.560
[Guest]: a corporation can use to change supply, you go up from one shift to two shifts, you go

02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:20.400
[Guest]: up from two shifts to three shifts, you bump up the capacity utilization of you squeeze

02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:24.760
[Guest]: every last bit of output of the machines. So the machines are not as fixed as meets

02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:30.160
[Guest]: the eye. It's not like a hospital bed, which can only do one person at a time. Okay, my

02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:39.000
[Guest]: second comment is that I think all of us tend to see serum as being here making the Covishield

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:44.080
[Guest]: vaccine out of thin air for free. What I feel they're not giving enough credit for is a

02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:51.600
[Guest]: wide array of risk taking that took place ahead of time. Out of which this is one of

02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:56.760
[Guest]: the few people that came out right. Many, many people took risks in the early stages

02:18:56.760 --> 02:19:03.000
[Guest]: of this and I want to tell a story about SARS-CoV-1. So when SARS-CoV-1 came, it was seen as a

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:08.280
[Guest]: very dangerous disease. The infection fatality rate for SARS-CoV-1 is higher than the infection

02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:14.200
[Guest]: fatality rate for SARS-CoV-2. So there was a whole energy of people who started studying

02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:17.440
[Guest]: SARS-CoV-1 and thinking I'm going to make a vaccine for this. So there was money that

02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:21.800
[Guest]: went into research on building vaccines into starting to build some manufacturing facilities

02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:28.600
[Guest]: and all that. Now it so happened that in the case of SARS-CoV-1, the public health delivered.

02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:36.960
[Guest]: The public health managed to do the trace test isolate and the epidemic went away. So

02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:44.320
[Guest]: in effect, there was no market for drugs or vaccines for SARS-CoV-1. All the people who

02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:49.440
[Guest]: put money into SARS-CoV-1 ended up getting nothing out of it, whether they were philanthropists

02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:53.560
[Guest]: or they were private people. So there were private people, there were companies, there

02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:58.320
[Guest]: were venture capitalists, there were philanthropists, there was a whole machinery that was flung

02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:02.040
[Guest]: to SARS-CoV-1, which in the event proved to be irrelevant.

02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:10.720
[Guest]: Turn to SARS-CoV-2. So first, there were people who were bearing the scars of the sadness

02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:14.760
[Guest]: that had happened after SARS-CoV-1, who were saying, you know what, are you sure we want

02:20:14.760 --> 02:20:19.880
[Guest]: to do this? Because we saw how badly that one worked out. And then many people decided

02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:24.080
[Guest]: that, okay, let's take the risk. Let's go build a research project, a manufacturing

02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:30.600
[Guest]: project to build a cure, to build a vaccine. More than 150 projects took off to try to

02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:35.040
[Guest]: build a vaccine. All of them committed money into it. Many, many manufacturing facilities

02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:39.160
[Guest]: were built. There are some seven different pathways to make a vaccine and many people

02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:43.080
[Guest]: thought that pathway number six is going to work and I'm going to preemptively build a

02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:47.520
[Guest]: factory in the belief that somebody is going to get a vaccine on pathway number six, and

02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:52.040
[Guest]: then they'll come to me and ask me for the manufacturing. Many of these people have lost

02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:58.800
[Guest]: money along the way. It just happens to be that Serum Institute, AstraZeneca is one combination

02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:04.120
[Guest]: which came out right at the end. We should not understate the risk that they took and

02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:10.640
[Guest]: in return for those risks, they need a fair return on their capital. And if we as a society

02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:17.520
[Guest]: are churlish about them earning that return, this will have two consequences. The first

02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:24.120
[Guest]: is that firms like Serum will think that it's not wise to have exposure to the Indian legal

02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:30.000
[Guest]: political system, and they will organize themselves as a London domiciled company. And the second

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:35.800
[Guest]: is that in the future, private firms will be even more careful and even more circumspect

02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:39.320
[Guest]: before building things that will be useful to the people of India.

02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:44.280
[Amit Varma]: Words that we should pay attention to, but the point is the people who kind of make all

02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:49.240
[Amit Varma]: the decisions regarding these things are politicians who find it more in their interest to signal

02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:54.840
[Amit Varma]: virtue than actually, you know, reach meaningful outcomes. And you never know the counterfactual.

02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:58.760
[Amit Varma]: So it's not as if you can, you know, look at a specific outcome.

02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:05.080
[Guest]: So I think that one thing has changed. Okay, late 2020, I felt that the debate was just

02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:10.360
[Guest]: pure ideology. Okay, I would just hit brick walls, where people would say, oh, how can

02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:16.520
[Guest]: there be a price for a vaccine? Or, oh, how can you have private people doing a vaccine?

02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:21.480
[Guest]: Or, oh, how can you have vaccine imports? Okay, these were just ideological brick walls.

02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:26.800
[Guest]: I think the most powerful thing that has changed today is one objective metric, the New York

02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:33.080
[Guest]: Times cross country comparison, where India is at rank 62. I think that's a powerful force

02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:39.480
[Guest]: of accountability. So if we had comparable date, global comparisons, good quality global

02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:44.360
[Guest]: comparisons on COVID-19, maybe things would have been different. But in the case of vaccination,

02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:48.940
[Guest]: we have a metric, we are able to look how India is faring compared to other countries.

02:22:48.940 --> 02:22:53.880
[Guest]: And I think that generates a good feedback loop that when policymakers will do the right

02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:57.120
[Guest]: things, India's rank in that will improve, and vice versa.

02:22:57.120 --> 02:23:02.080
[Amit Varma]: We are recording this on April 29. You know, sitting here in the thick of things, we're

02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:06.800
[Amit Varma]: not as much in the fog of war as we were last year, this time, we know a lot more. And yet

02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:11.520
[Amit Varma]: right now, we are in the middle of this crazy crisis that is happening in our country, which

02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:17.760
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, like nothing I have seen in my lifetime, frankly, it's just insane. Like,

02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:21.800
[Amit Varma]: how do you look at this? You know, we are in the middle of great trauma and great pain,

02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:27.000
[Amit Varma]: both collectively and very often individually. But at the same time, you know, you said you

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:32.040
[Amit Varma]: are a natural optimist. So what are the things that kind of make you optimistic? Like in

02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:36.480
[Amit Varma]: one sense, of course, there is a way that science is progressing by leaps and bounds,

02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:40.680
[Amit Varma]: and that should give us hope for sure. But what gives you hope? And what gives you despair

02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:45.560
[Amit Varma]: about whatever you have learned from this current crisis and how things are evolving?

02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:56.480
[Guest]: Hearing about friends, and the nightmare of COVID-19 is just profoundly challenging. You

02:23:56.480 --> 02:24:01.800
[Guest]: know, we're running out of tears. It is so difficult to deal with that. So that's the

02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:08.120
[Guest]: everyday nightmare that we face. In terms of how this plays out, I have one important

02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:16.360
[Guest]: disagreement with many international comparisons, most notably by the economists. Okay, so economists

02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:24.760
[Guest]: and finance people are tending to measure normalcy in a country by the vaccination rate.

02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:29.400
[Guest]: And I think that is incorrect, because past experience with the disease also immunizes

02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:36.320
[Guest]: a person until they get to genuinely new variants. And my opinion is that by and large in India

02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:44.960
[Guest]: today, we are in decent shape, that the variants that are in the fray are generally not breaking

02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:52.000
[Guest]: through into people who have had the disease once before. So the true rate at which India

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:59.200
[Guest]: is changing the disease dynamics is the combination of vaccination and disease experience. And

02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:09.000
[Guest]: that gives me a lot of hope. Then, if we manage to address these dangers of price controls,

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:16.260
[Guest]: and if we get private people thinking that instead of spending 45,000 rupees to buy an

02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:24.600
[Guest]: oxygen cylinder, I should spend 4500 rupees to buy vaccination services, then that would

02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:30.720
[Guest]: be pretty transformative. Because if 100 million people will go get vaccinated, it would do

02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:38.400
[Guest]: a lot of good in terms of changing the disease dynamics. The vaccine shortage is less dangerous

02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:44.200
[Guest]: than meets the eye. Because for people who've had the disease once, you only need one dose.

02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:48.800
[Guest]: So you don't need to multiply large numbers of Indian people vaccinated multiplied by

02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:55.560
[Guest]: two to get to the desired objective, you can make do with a lower number of vaccine doses.

02:25:55.560 --> 02:26:00.760
[Guest]: And my last piece of optimism is that the vaccine supply situation is getting better

02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:07.640
[Guest]: quite dramatically. Every day, the manufacturing side of the global vaccines business is learning

02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:14.360
[Guest]: to tweak their processes and get up to higher output. And every day, more vaccine candidates

02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:19.280
[Guest]: are finishing their trials and generally the results are pretty good. By and large, many

02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:25.080
[Guest]: approaches that mankind has taken to find a vaccine have proved to be successful. So

02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:30.640
[Guest]: as the days and weeks and months go by, in my opinion, vaccine availability will improve

02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:36.520
[Guest]: significantly. We've just got to solve the barrier in our heads about paying market prices.

02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:41.600
[Guest]: So when we buy a mobile phone, we basically look at competing choices from all over the

02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:45.480
[Guest]: world and then we don't whine that I'm not willing to pay 10,000 rupees for a mobile

02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:50.240
[Guest]: phone. Okay, we say that's a market discovered price. It achieves legitimacy because it was

02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:54.560
[Guest]: discovered on a competitive market. I think the most important point about today is that

02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:59.320
[Guest]: we are already there. There are five rival vendors who are ready to sit across the table

02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:04.840
[Guest]: and negotiate with you as long as you give them the correct legal liability protections.

02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:09.240
[Guest]: They can discuss maybe their factories are booked out till June, then maybe in July,

02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:13.680
[Guest]: they'll be able to say I can give you 1 million doses in July, or whatever. It's a business

02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:20.480
[Guest]: and we in India need to get into that arena and start playing where various Indian persons

02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:23.220
[Guest]: are trying to buy vaccines.

02:27:23.220 --> 02:27:27.600
[Amit Varma]: And I want to add to that and also before that, sort of come up with a clarification,

02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:32.320
[Amit Varma]: which is that, you know, when you said that people who got the disease earlier or are

02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:36.880
[Amit Varma]: getting vaccinated now are protected against these variants, that is very much true, in

02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:40.400
[Amit Varma]: the sense that it doesn't mean that they won't get COVID-19 again, they might get COVID-19

02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:45.240
[Amit Varma]: again, but the severity will be much less. And I think by now there is enough credible

02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:50.960
[Amit Varma]: data that I have seen out there saying that both Covishield and Covaxin, you know, prevent

02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:55.360
[Amit Varma]: the disease from getting severe if you do happen to catch it after you get vaccinated.

02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:00.940
[Amit Varma]: So please go out and get vaccinated. The other sort of point I'd like to add, which is something

02:28:00.940 --> 02:28:05.560
[Amit Varma]: you have also made in your articles is that, you know, people will complain that okay,

02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:11.200
[Amit Varma]: if you allow it to be sold on the private market and you know, it'll create inequalities,

02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:14.960
[Amit Varma]: those with money will get it and so on. Two points I'd like to make there. One, of course,

02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:20.360
[Amit Varma]: is that it is not either or, the government should on a war footing just vaccinate everyone

02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:25.520
[Amit Varma]: for free as much as they can, but at the same time, let private parties do what they do.

02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:30.880
[Amit Varma]: The other point is, let us say that from the private party, a rich guy who can afford whatever

02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:36.020
[Amit Varma]: it costs is going out and getting vaccinated. He's not the only one who's benefiting. Everybody

02:28:36.020 --> 02:28:40.520
[Amit Varma]: is benefiting. This is the kind of thing where society benefits when any individual gets

02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:45.660
[Amit Varma]: vaccinated because of those around him. And when these people who buy their vaccinations,

02:28:45.660 --> 02:28:50.080
[Amit Varma]: not only are others around them benefiting, they also feel confident to go out in the

02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:54.420
[Amit Varma]: world and get about their business and the economy also benefits and again, that has

02:28:54.420 --> 02:29:00.120
[Amit Varma]: positive externalities and others benefit as well. So, you know, we've got to kind of

02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:05.360
[Amit Varma]: think about all these angles as well. And the government should do vouchers. Right.

02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:09.180
[Amit Varma]: And by vouchers, what you essentially mean is that you get vouchers, you can spend it

02:29:09.180 --> 02:29:14.440
[Guest]: on whatever vaccine you want. Correct. So, private people would get a voucher of say

02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:20.600
[Guest]: 1000 rupees for a dose. And the private person would go to a private producer of their choice

02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:26.520
[Guest]: and pay something, it doesn't matter what it could be 25,000 or 2000. And out of the

02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:32.120
[Guest]: 2000 that has to be paid, 1000 would be paid in cash, 1000 would be paid as a voucher.

02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:35.920
[Guest]: And the private vendor would get a reimbursement of 1000 rupees from the government. So, this

02:29:35.920 --> 02:29:40.080
[Guest]: is the way to get vaccination out on scale to poor people. The government doesn't need

02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:46.520
[Guest]: to produce schools, the government needs to give vouchers, and then parents will use the

02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:50.920
[Guest]: vouchers and buy schooling services. In the same fashion, parents will use those vouchers

02:29:50.920 --> 02:29:58.560
[Guest]: and buy vaccination services. So, the objective is you have either of equity, or of emphasizing

02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:04.320
[Guest]: certain subsets of the population, such as schoolteachers, or of emphasizing some regions

02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:09.120
[Guest]: where the epidemic is particularly bad. If you feel there are some political compulsions,

02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:13.880
[Guest]: then you should cater to them through vouchers, rather than saying that I will do the whole

02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:20.520
[Guest]: thing. Because the government machinery tried its best. I respect the constraints of the

02:30:20.520 --> 02:30:25.640
[Guest]: operating environment for the officials, and they delivered rank 62 in the world. So, let's

02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:28.200
[Guest]: have no high hopes for what a government can do.

02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:33.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more. And once again, I am not someone who ever advocates

02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:38.080
[Amit Varma]: government spending, I'm against most government spending. But in this case, we are at war.

02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:41.880
[Amit Varma]: And for me, there are really no limits. This is a question of spending billions to save

02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:47.440
[Amit Varma]: trillions down the line, which of course is unseen, but we have to kind of do it. Ajay,
