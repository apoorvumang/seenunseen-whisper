00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.480
[Amit Varma]: On December 6, 1992, a group of young men climbed on top of a mosque in Ayodhya and

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.680
[Amit Varma]: demolished a part of India.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.720
[Amit Varma]: It was a symbolic moment for our country, but I'd argue that it wasn't a seminal

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.720
[Amit Varma]: one.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.720
[Amit Varma]: It wasn't a turning point.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.640
[Amit Varma]: There were forces that happened to be gathering strength at that point and what was destroyed

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.320
[Amit Varma]: that day would have been destroyed anyway.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.120
[Amit Varma]: There was a cultural movement that had been on the rise for a century.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.040
[Amit Varma]: There was a political movement that was on the upswing and about to become unstoppable.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.520
[Amit Varma]: December 6, 1992 was just one milestone in the journey that has brought us to December

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.960
[Amit Varma]: 6, 2020.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.960
[Amit Varma]: In these 28 years, our politics has changed, our society has changed, our country has changed.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.400
[Amit Varma]: And it's worth looking back at how all this happened.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.800
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.800
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.880
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.880
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.240
[Amit Varma]: If modern Indian politics has been taken over by the jugalbandi of Narendra Modi and Amit

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.880
[Amit Varma]: Shah, this pair of politicians was enabled by an earlier jugalbandi before them, that

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.760
[Amit Varma]: of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.640
[Amit Varma]: For decades, Vajpayee and Advani fought what appeared to be a losing battle until they

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.640
[Amit Varma]: won.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.840
[Amit Varma]: No matter which side of the political spectrum you're on, this is a fascinating story.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.840
[Amit Varma]: To understand India, we have to understand the rise of Hindu nationalism and the rise

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.200
[Amit Varma]: of the BJP.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.840
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Vinay Sitapati, author of the marvelous book, Jugalbandi, the BJP before

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.840
[Amit Varma]: Modi.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.160
[Amit Varma]: Vinay has been a lawyer, a journalist, and a political scientist.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.840
[Amit Varma]: And when you read his book, you'll find that he's a fine historian and writer as well.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.760
[Amit Varma]: Jugalbandi looks at the evolution of political Hindu nationalism through the prism of the

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.380
[Amit Varma]: partnership between Vajpayee and Advani, a friendship that spanned decades and was even

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.360
[Amit Varma]: a bit of a bromance, actually.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.680
[Amit Varma]: The book busts the simple stereotypes that linger around both men and gave me great insight

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.660
[Amit Varma]: into the RSS, the motivations of Hindu nationalism, and how this was a bottom-up movement in which

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.720
[Amit Varma]: the politicians were merely rational actors responding to incentives from the demand side

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.880
[Amit Varma]: of the political marketplace.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.040
[Amit Varma]: And that remains the case even in this age of Modi and Shah.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.120
[Amit Varma]: Before I begin my conversation with Vinay though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.440
[Amit Varma]: A friend of mine once advised me to end each day by asking myself the question, what have

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440
[Amit Varma]: I learned today?

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.740
[Amit Varma]: Luckily, we live in times when a world of knowledge is at our fingertips.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.400
[Amit Varma]: This episode is sponsored by an awesome site called The Great Courses Plus, where I've

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.520
[Amit Varma]: been flipping through a bunch of fascinating courses.

[Amit Varma]: you can think of.

[Amit Varma]: Vinay, welcome to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.880
[Guest]: Thank you very much, Amit.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, before we start, and I must say I enjoyed reading your book enormously, tons

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.360
[Amit Varma]: of insights in there for someone like me.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.520
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk a bit about your personal journey though.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, this is of course, your second biography, your first one was of D. V. Narsimha Rao.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.120
[Amit Varma]: But let's even sort of go a little further back in time, you know, what did you want

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.120
[Amit Varma]: to do when you were growing up?

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.200
[Amit Varma]: You've described yourself elsewhere as a child of liberalization in the sense that your dad

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.280
[Amit Varma]: shifted from a PSU to a private sector company and all of that.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.040
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about the young Vinay.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040
[Amit Varma]: What was he like?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.160
[Amit Varma]: What did he want to do?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.040
[Amit Varma]: What were the different sort of routes you took through your life?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:42.480
[Guest]: Well, Amit, when I had to apply for a master's degree or PhD, you have to write these personal

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.480
[Guest]: statements, right?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.320
[Guest]: And I realized when it came to my personal statement that there wasn't a narrative.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.720
[Guest]: I was just kind of following instinct.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.520
[Unknown]: So I think your listeners won't get like, when I write my books, I make sure there's

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.520
[Unknown]: a narrative, right?

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.520
[Guest]: Like Vajpayee is born and then Advani is born and then they kind of move up with the arc

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.520
[Unknown]: of history.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.800
[Unknown]: Now, unfortunately, that's not the case with me.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.920
[Guest]: So you know, to give you a sense, I'm 37.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.040
[Guest]: So I'm a child of the 1990s.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.640
[Guest]: And you know, my father had, you know, he worked for Ex-Im Bank, which was a PSU.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.480
[Guest]: And then he left in the early 90s to start off on his own as a consultant.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.680
[Guest]: And I remember it was a very dislocating time for all of us, you know, that in Nehruvian

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.880
[Guest]: India, if you are a government employee, you know, you had a nice house, you know, you

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.840
[Guest]: had like a car and a driver, it was all as long as you're in government service, it's

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.240
[Guest]: a pretty comfy life, I think prior to 91, then he made it out on his own and you know,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.360
[Guest]: this was a rough and tumble of the early private sector.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.440
[Guest]: And I still remember, you know, we didn't have a car and okay, whatever, but you know,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.560
[Guest]: when you're a kid, you know, people kids talk, they make jokes, you know, it's a it's a thing.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.080
[Guest]: And so it stayed with me and I couldn't quite understand it or I couldn't quite make sense

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.120
[Guest]: of it at that time, but I knew that there was a shift, for example, I remember sometime

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.120
[Guest]: around 95.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.120
[Guest]: So I'm, you know, born and brought up in Bandra, I'm from Bandra.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.200
[Guest]: And I remember McDonald's coming for the first time, you know, in Linking Road.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.200
[Guest]: And we all went there.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.680
[Guest]: And there was this huge line, you know, and it was so long a line that they had dedicated,

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.800
[Unknown]: you know, servers to come with the menu.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.160
[Guest]: And so you can order while you're in that line, and that line kind of sneaked through

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.160
[Guest]: Linking Road.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.320
[Guest]: Then again, like I couldn't mix and I remember Baba Sehgal and you know, that kind of thing.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.400
[Guest]: And again, you know, it's not that I could make sense of it at that time.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.040
[Guest]: But I remember looking back, there was something dislocating about it, you know, and it took

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.840
[Guest]: me a while to realize that my immediate story is also the largest story of many Indians

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.840
[Guest]: during that period.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.800
[Guest]: Then the other sort of, again, in the early 90s, you know, something that I grew up with

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.160
[Guest]: was the rise of the BJP, you know, in 95.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.840
[Guest]: The Shiv Sena BJP comes to power for the first time in Maharashtra, where I was, and it ended

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.160
[Unknown]: basically a total hegemony of the Congress.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.000
[Unknown]: So even the non-Congress governments in Maharashtra until then was broadly splinter groups, broadly,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
[Guest]: you know.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.880
[Guest]: And I remember very clearly the Bombay riots, you know, immediately after the demolition

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.880
[Guest]: of Babri Masjid whose anniversary is right now.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.800
[Guest]: So this is, you know, just soon after December 6, 92.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.240
[Guest]: And I remember, you know, we were on this side of the Mahim Creek in Bandra Reclamation.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.240
[Guest]: And I remember we could all get on to the top of our building and look at the timber

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.080
[Guest]: yards owned by Muslims on the other side of the creek burning.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.440
[Guest]: And again, I couldn't, you know, this, like, you know, whatever, I was a kid.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.840
[Guest]: So none of this kind of, you know, made sense to me at that time.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.040
[Guest]: But looking back, I think some of it may have lingered, you know, and my first book was

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.200
[Guest]: definitely a way to make sense of liberalization.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.920
[Guest]: And I focused on a person, Narasimha Rao, and sort of the core of the argument of the

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.760
[Guest]: book is that liberalization wasn't fated to happen.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.280
[Guest]: You know, McDonald's, it wasn't an inevitable march of history that McDonald's would open

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.280
[Guest]: in Linky Grove.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.640
[Guest]: But it was, there was a lot of political maneuvering, right, done by the Prime Minister of the day

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.920
[Guest]: that allowed it to happen against the arc of history.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.240
[Guest]: So in some sense, I was pushing against those who say that with the collapse of the Soviet

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.080
[Guest]: Union, you know, with, you know, the decline of the Indian economy, you know, this was

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.080
[Guest]: inevitable.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.960
[Guest]: I, you know, and so that was the argument for that book.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.200
[Guest]: And for this book, you know, I guess, you know, I was looking a little more at Hindu

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.160
[Guest]: nationalism, a little less as a biography.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.280
[Guest]: So as you've read, I mean, firstly, it's a biography of a relationship, right?

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.840
[Guest]: It's not just a biography and the relationship itself is a symbol for the larger question

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.800
[Guest]: why the BJP wins, like what is the Hindu nationalism and why the BJP wins.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.280
[Guest]: So in that sense, this is more of a kind of a classically academic or scholarly question,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.840
[Guest]: which is, you know, what explains the hundred year story of the BJP.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:00.920
[Guest]: But even so, I can, you know, I do sense looking back that, you know, that it's not a coincidence

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.680
[Guest]: that these are my two books and I was a child of the 90s.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.720
[Amit Varma]: No, no, that's fascinating and you brought memories stumbling back because when McDonald's

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.920
[Amit Varma]: opened here, I remember sort of being in an auto going through Linking Road and realizing

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.040
[Amit Varma]: that the line to McDonald's started in Khar.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that was because I was part of the line, that was part of the...

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.720
[Amit Varma]: Well, you alone didn't make it stretch all the way to Khar, but yeah, you were one of

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.720
[Amit Varma]: the sort of unwashed masses, you know, and I mean, I didn't join the line that day, but

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.480
[Amit Varma]: I joined the line some other day.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.960
[Guest]: Also Amit, it's actually the washed masses because, you know, McDonald's at that time

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.800
[Unknown]: was an upper class thing.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.880
[Unknown]: You know, it's not, it was an upper middle class idea, whereas in the United States,

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.760
[Guest]: the people who go to McDonald's tend to be poorer, right, generally.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.120
[Guest]: In that time period, you were looking at that line, it was the aspiration for upper middle

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.120
[Guest]: class India.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.400
[Amit Varma]: Well, you know, if I have to quibble with that trivial point, I could also say that

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.000
[Amit Varma]: number one, you know, people down the line might consider it offensive that you are implying

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.080
[Amit Varma]: that they don't wash and that washing, you know, goes up in frequency with the classes.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.440
[Amit Varma]: And also, you know, if a future biographer of yours is to, you know, eventually investigate

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.440
[Amit Varma]: your life, I'm sure he'll, in hindsight, stick a narrative to it, just as you know, all biographies

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.440
[Amit Varma]: have to have.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.600
[Amit Varma]: And a little bit of that is emerging now.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.480
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, taking off from what you just said, I sort of have a question there.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.960
[Amit Varma]: As you said in your first book, one of the points that you were making is that liberalization

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.760
[Amit Varma]: wasn't inevitable, the things that happened weren't inevitable.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:35.400
[Amit Varma]: Now, one of my frequent bugbears often is that we don't think probabilistically about

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.520
[Amit Varma]: the world in the sense that whenever something has happened, we assume that it was inevitable.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.760
[Amit Varma]: While obviously, at any given point in time, we only have a sea of probabilities ahead

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.760
[Amit Varma]: of us.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.600
[Amit Varma]: But in hindsight, there is an inevitability.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.000
[Amit Varma]: And that can lead us to underplay both the role of chance and the role of individuals.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.400
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, there's one sort of common strand in history that you must have grappled

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.360
[Amit Varma]: with about how, you know, there's no such thing as a great man theory of history.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.600
[Amit Varma]: And it's all, you know, there are larger currents which determine how the world's move.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.160
[Amit Varma]: But the more I read of history and including much of what is in this book, it just strikes

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.920
[Amit Varma]: me that chance events really make so much of a difference, like you've brought up various

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.400
[Amit Varma]: counterfactuals in your book, which we'll discuss when we get to it.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.960
[Amit Varma]: And it seems that the history of the country could have been different had we proceeded

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.240
[Amit Varma]: down a slightly different line.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.560
[Amit Varma]: So what is your sense of this?

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.720
[Amit Varma]: And this is really a dual question.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.680
[Amit Varma]: One is that there are, I suppose, different academic approaches to history.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:44.160
[Amit Varma]: And is it then you sometimes find that you have to set those aside when you are actually,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, performing the task of writing history or doing history as it were.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.040
[Amit Varma]: And what are sort of your views on all this?

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:57.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, would you also tend to say that chance is actually the biggest determinate, you know,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.600
[Guest]: of what really happens?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.440
[Guest]: Well, that's a very good question, Amit.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.480
[Guest]: And as you can see, in both this book, as well as the Narsimha Rao book, I spend a lot

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.880
[Guest]: of time playing up the role of events and individuals, right?

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.280
[Guest]: I wouldn't call it chance alone, right?

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.480
[Unknown]: Because events happen for a variety of like, let's take emergency, it's not luck.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.080
[Guest]: But as you read in the book, the emergency has played a huge role in socializing the

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:27.400
[Guest]: RSS and BJP of that era, note I mean of that era, right, into respecting civil liberties,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.320
[Unknown]: you know, because they realize that, look, if we put people in jail, they can also put

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.120
[Guest]: us in jail, you know, and the law is what kind of comes in between that, or, you know,

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.920
[Guest]: in the book itself, I point out the murder of Mahatma Gandhi.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:45.120
[Guest]: And I'm quite clear that the institutions of Hindu nationalism, namely Hindu Mahasabha

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.680
[Guest]: at the time and RSS didn't play a role.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:53.120
[Unknown]: But the ideology totally did in the sense that the RSS criticism of Gandhi was shared

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.120
[Guest]: by Godse.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.120
[Unknown]: 100%.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.120
[Unknown]: Right?

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.720
[Guest]: It's just that the RSS didn't want to take any violent action, you know, to act on that

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.720
[Guest]: inference.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:06.120
[Guest]: But as a consequence, the Indian state came down very hard on the RSS, very, very hard.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:12.040
[Unknown]: Even today, even today, almost what 70 years later, the RSS remembers that period between

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:18.040
[Guest]: February 1948, and I think July 1949, as its most traumatic period, all the pracharats

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.040
[Guest]: were thrown in jail, the head of the RSS, Bulwarkar was thrown in jail.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.680
[Guest]: And you know, it's sort of, it pushes the RSS, which until that time was an anti-political

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:32.400
[Guest]: organization, which was critical of electoral politics into creating a political party,

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.520
[Guest]: the Jansan, which is a precursor of the BJP, as political insurance.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.520
[Guest]: Right?

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.000
[Guest]: So that's, again, just one example to show exactly the point you're making.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.080
[Guest]: At the same time, I mean, I am, you know, I'm a trained academic, right?

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.240
[Unknown]: Like I have like, you know, like, you know, given that academics don't make much money,

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.520
[Guest]: I tell my larger family, look, I have five degrees, you know, and that's taught me something

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.920
[Guest]: and it's taught me that structure, demographics also make a difference, right?

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:04.080
[Guest]: So to give you one example, I point out that a lot of events in the 1980s, Rath Yatra,

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.160
[Guest]: for example, helped in the mobilization of the BJP.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:12.840
[Guest]: But fundamentally, the rise of the BJP began as a set of demographic anxieties, right,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.400
[Guest]: which are bottom up.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:19.480
[Guest]: So for example, Hindu fear of all castes because of the Khalistan movement, because Khalistanis

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.600
[Guest]: were targeting Hindus as Hindus, right?

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.280
[Guest]: And the upper caste North Indian fears because of the extension of OBC reservation in Northern

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.200
[Guest]: Indian states, right?

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.880
[Guest]: All this worry that Saudi petrodollars is going to fuel conversions in India, exemplified

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:40.560
[Guest]: by the controversy surrounding the 1981 Meenakshi Kurang conversions in Tamil Nadu, a small

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.000
[Guest]: town in Tamil Nadu.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.600
[Unknown]: So these are not just events and individuals, right?

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.160
[Guest]: These are like larger forces that are reshaping India.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:54.480
[Guest]: And I think that, I mean, I'd love to discuss this, that my dual training as a journalist

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:59.760
[Guest]: and an academic makes me alive to both, you know, and this book is both, you know, so

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.560
[Unknown]: if a journalist reads it, what she or he will find nice about the book is it talks about

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.440
[Unknown]: like these larger structural stories that journalists don't focus on, right?

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.720
[Guest]: And in academics, what they like is that it focuses on events and individuals which normally

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.720
[Guest]: they don't focus on.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:19.120
[Guest]: And I think it's a serious error on the part of academics that they don't do this.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.160
[Guest]: And you know, I mean, I'm not a historian, I'm a political scientist, right?

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.680
[Guest]: So this, I mean, I'm looking at a hundred year political history of the BJP, but my

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.760
[Guest]: training is as a political scientist.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.760
[Unknown]: So I'm interested in causation, right?

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.480
[Unknown]: I'm not just interested in narration.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:38.200
[Guest]: So the end of the book, as you'll see, I give you a set of arguments for why, what Hindu

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.200
[Guest]: nationalism is.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.200
[Guest]: Look, it's not fascist, it's majoritarian, and also why the BJP wins, right?

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.600
[Guest]: And the 1980s itself, I give you a complex set of causal arguments because causation

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.600
[Guest]: matters to me.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.360
[Guest]: And if causation matters to you, like, you know, what causes the rise of the BJP rather

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:58.760
[Guest]: than just give a description of the BJP and say, you know, like I keep telling my students

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.080
[Guest]: that, you know, when you're explaining anything, it can't be a Gujarati thali with like a hundred

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.080
[Guest]: explanations, right?

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:09.320
[Guest]: You have to say that, look, the BJP rose because of A and B and not C and D. That's very important

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.320
[Guest]: for me, right?

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.320
[Guest]: That you also have to exclude the arguments that you don't think work.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.560
[Guest]: Otherwise, it's a bit of a cop out to say that, look, there's a bit of everything, right?

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.800
[Unknown]: But if you have that kind of mentality, then you should be open that, look, occasionally

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.160
[Guest]: events matter, occasionally individuals matter, occasionally structures matter, right?

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.320
[Guest]: Like to give you another example, unrelated to India, I mean, let's look at the Brexit,

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.320
[Guest]: right?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.360
[Guest]: The decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.640
[Guest]: A lot of that is explained through personalities, you know, the personalities of the times.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.800
[Guest]: Just looking at these larger structural reasons, globalization, decline of white working class

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.520
[Guest]: pride, you won't get Brexit.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.560
[Guest]: And if you are a social scientist who is honest or wants to be honest about not like peddling

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:58.040
[Guest]: your pet disciplinary lens, but finding an answer to the truth, you have to be kind of

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.160
[Guest]: ecumenical about the approaches that you use.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160
[Guest]: That's how I came to it.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.120
[Guest]: I mean, in fact, I would say that, you know, I began my career as a lawyer, in the sense

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.840
[Guest]: I studied at National Law School, Bangalore and Harvard Law School.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.720
[Guest]: And I then, you know, worked as a journalist with Indian Express, I would say the best

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.080
[Guest]: political newspaper in India in English.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.900
[Guest]: And then I've also been an academic.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:24.800
[Guest]: So I luckily for me, like this three careers that I've had, has given me, you know, a bullshit

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:30.720
[Guest]: detector about what is what any of those sort of professions can add value.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:35.840
[Guest]: And what is just the added the added ingredients to the profession that has nothing to do with

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.560
[Guest]: actual value, right?

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.440
[Guest]: So for example, lawyers are trained to write petitions in a certain kind of way.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.280
[Unknown]: Now, it's not very well written, it's not very logical, if you look at, you know, Supreme

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.360
[Guest]: Court judgments, they're not well written.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.520
[Guest]: But one of the reasons they're written using a lot of jargon is to prevent non lawyers

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.520
[Guest]: from writing it.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.400
[Guest]: Otherwise, the lawyers, why would you go to a lawyer, you can write your own petition,

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.400
[Guest]: right?

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.360
[Guest]: Academia is like that, you have like entire disciplines like to focus on jargon, because

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.400
[Unknown]: if they, you know, if they were very clear about what they were trying to say, people

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.040
[Guest]: will say, why are we paying this, you know, why are we paying the salary?

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:15.480
[Guest]: So it's given me I think, luckily for me, I and so I don't have to, you know, put myself

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.480
[Unknown]: in a box that way.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.920
[Unknown]: I mean, and I'm very proud of that, I think you're like that, you know, somebody says,

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.920
[Guest]: are you a blogger?

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.920
[Guest]: Are you an advertising?

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.920
[Guest]: Are you a podcaster?

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.280
[Guest]: You know, I don't think you think of yourself that way.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.280
[Guest]: And that's quite liberating.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.280
[Guest]: You know,

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, in retrospect, at least in my case, it seems like a feature and not a bug.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:37.000
[Amit Varma]: But at the time, who knows, I do intend to, you know, explore more of your personal journey.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.960
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, we'll get deep into the book as well.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.840
[Amit Varma]: But before that, you know, there's a question I'd save for, you know, in part of in my list

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.980
[Amit Varma]: of closing questions, which are more broad, but it kind of comes up.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.320
[Amit Varma]: So I'll mention it again.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.800
[Amit Varma]: And this actually goes contrary to the last point that I raised.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:59.320
[Amit Varma]: And it's a question about whether there is something specific in the drift of political

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.120
[Amit Varma]: movements that is inevitable.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:07.880
[Amit Varma]: And the question sort of struck me first, when I was reading about what happened right

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:13.120
[Amit Varma]: after Gandhiji's assassination, where, you know, obviously, Godse had once been part

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.280
[Amit Varma]: of the RSS, but not for a long time.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.520
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, it's very clear, the RSS had no role to play.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.960
[Amit Varma]: And secondly, while the RSS was banned, the Hindu Mahasabha wasn't banned, partly because

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.880
[Amit Varma]: of course, Shamab Prasad Mukherjee was in the cabinet, but also because the past that

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.440
[Amit Varma]: we realized that even though these people were in the Hindu Mahasabha, they were a sort

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.320
[Amit Varma]: of an extremist faction of it.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.520
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you know, there's no need to blame the whole party or the movement for

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.520
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.440
[Amit Varma]: But when I look at modern times, what also appears to me to be the case is that within

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:50.480
[Amit Varma]: the BJP also, you have sort of this move towards the extremes in the sense that you get from

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.520
[Amit Varma]: Shamab Prasad to Vajpayee to Advani to Modi to Shah to perhaps Adityanath and so on.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.440
[Amit Varma]: And this seems to be a drift that, you know, when you think about it is perfectly rational,

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.600
[Amit Varma]: because you can't whip up your foot soldiers with moderation, you whip them up with by

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.880
[Amit Varma]: getting more and more extreme, even within a party, that's perhaps how you compete.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.760
[Amit Varma]: Even within social media, when you look at how ideological echo chambers are formed,

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.320
[Amit Varma]: and what you need to raise your, to signal your virtue in those echo chambers that you

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.160
[Amit Varma]: belong to, it seems that a drift towards extremism is inevitable.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:30.440
[Amit Varma]: So in any ideological party or group, do you think the drift towards extremism is inevitable?

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.060
[Amit Varma]: Or am I just or is it just the availability heuristic that these examples are coming to

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.060
[Amit Varma]: my mind?

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.060
[Guest]: Because I've just read your book?

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.720
[Guest]: No, no, you're definitely on to something, right?

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.680
[Guest]: Which is that that has been the general trajectory you see of the BJP.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680
[Guest]: So I think that's like a fact.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680
[Guest]: Right?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.560
[Guest]: So let's just see why that is the case.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:52.040
[Guest]: One is I don't think it's a, it's a constant move towards extremism, because even in this

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.200
[Guest]: 100 year history, you've had a lot of ups and downs, right?

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:02.200
[Guest]: So to give you an example, between 1986 and 1995, or 1994, the BJP was in a more quote

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.560
[Guest]: unquote extremist or radical mode.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:10.480
[Guest]: But after that, between 95, 96, all the way to I would say even 2014, it was in a much

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.360
[Unknown]: more moderate mode, right?

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.280
[Unknown]: So you do have a little bit of a yin and yang, right?

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.960
[Guest]: And I argue that a lot of that has to do with electoral politics, in the sense that you're

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.840
[Guest]: trying to understand what the mood is of the voter.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.440
[Guest]: So you have these ups and downs.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:31.520
[Guest]: So that said, I think that this general trajectory you're talking about, about the BJP or Janssang

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.720
[Guest]: BJP has a lot to do Amit with, you know, and I make this point repeatedly in the book that

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:44.640
[Guest]: the, especially after the murder of the Mahatma, Hindu nationalism is on back foot, you know,

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.560
[Guest]: it is untouchable, you know, nobody wants to, you know, have anything to do with it.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:55.480
[Guest]: And so I think that is the period that socializes Vajpayee and Advani, you know, that between,

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.640
[Guest]: you know, after the murder of the Mahatma, Hindu nationalism has to always kind of, you

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:05.400
[Guest]: know, whatever its private feelings, right, it has to kind of merge with the larger parliamentary

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.240
[Guest]: opposition.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.680
[Guest]: And I think today you have a very different majority that Narendra Modi enjoys, like at

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.440
[Guest]: the height of his power, Vajpayee only had 170 to 180 seats, right?

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.440
[Guest]: Something like that.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:24.880
[Guest]: This is in the, you know, the 98 and 99 elections, Narendra Modi has a clear majority, he doesn't

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.960
[Guest]: need the Shiv Sena, he doesn't need the Akali, he doesn't need a simple ally.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:34.960
[Guest]: A lot of it has to do with that background and really to understand Advani and Vajpayee,

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:41.400
[Guest]: you have to understand that the circumstances that they were doing politics in broadly required

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.360
[Guest]: a Hindu nationalism that had to appear moderate, right?

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.720
[Guest]: There were, of course, exceptions like the Rath Yatra, etc, etc.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.840
[Guest]: I think those times have changed now.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:55.760
[Guest]: So I won't, you know, and who knows, you know, in the future, if you have certain demographic

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:02.000
[Guest]: changes, where the Hindu voter is much less radical, you may have a much less radical

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
[Guest]: Hindu politics.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.440
[Guest]: Because you've seen that before, Amit, like, you know, I argue in the book that the 1920s

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:12.720
[Guest]: were a period where you had Hindu and Muslim anxiety and sort of the core argument of the

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.520
[Guest]: book is that it's driven by the introduction of elections, right?

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:21.760
[Guest]: But what you have is a moderate Hindu leader, namely Mohandas Gandhi, who is a Hindu leader,

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.760
[Guest]: right?

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.400
[Guest]: And I can't stress that enough, when he passes away in 1948, when he's murdered, Mohamad Ali

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.200
[Guest]: Jinnah now in Pakistan famously says a great leader of the Hindu community has died, right?

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.480
[Guest]: I mean, Gandhi's language, his dress was a, you know, all of that was Hindu, except he

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.480
[Guest]: wasn't anti-Muslim.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.960
[Guest]: That was and he was able to moderate those fears, right?

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.720
[Guest]: But in 1980s, you know, when you had Hindu anxiety, once again, in the air, you didn't

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.640
[Guest]: have a moderate Hindu leader, right?

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.040
[Guest]: So therefore, you have you ended up with much more radicalization, and that just goes back

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.240
[Guest]: to the first thing we were discussing, Amit, that, you know, to understand politics, you

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.160
[Guest]: have to, it's a complex game, you have to understand this interaction between, you know,

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:07.120
[Guest]: so the nature of the voter matters, but leaders can often sort of tamper that down or exaggerate

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.120
[Guest]: it.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.560
[Guest]: And there's no simple answer to that question.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.800
[Guest]: And you have to look at focus at particular events to see what is going on there.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.040
[Amit Varma]: So just kind of thinking aloud and carrying on from there, you know, while you point out

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:24.800
[Amit Varma]: that there was an ebb and flow from say, the 80s onwards, until now, it is also the case

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.320
[Amit Varma]: that that ebb and flow might have been in the politics itself, that is in the supply

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:34.600
[Amit Varma]: side of the political marketplace, but in the demand side of the marketplace, it just

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.960
[Amit Varma]: continued down the road of extremism in the sense of the reason Vajpayee was replaced

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:44.280
[Amit Varma]: was because he didn't get that he was moving towards this moderate path of Gandhi and socialism

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.640
[Amit Varma]: as he called it, and then, you know, after 84, he had to be replaced because they did

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.800
[Amit Varma]: so badly.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, then Advani was forced to take the party in the sort of other direction.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.920
[Amit Varma]: And I'm also struck by this interesting Amit Shah quote from your book where Amit Shah

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:06.040
[Amit Varma]: in 2019 is asked about the difference between the pair of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.040
[Amit Varma]: and himself and Narendra Modi.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.640
[Amit Varma]: And you quote him as saying, quote, they never believed that fully waving the Hindutva flag

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.000
[Amit Varma]: could win them votes.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.040
[Amit Varma]: This is a difference between us and them, stop quote.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:23.000
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, you know, even the move towards Hindutva that, you know, Advani and Vajpayee

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.920
[Amit Varma]: seem to go towards seems kind of reactive to what they feel will win them votes, and

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:35.520
[Amit Varma]: a correction of the previous mistake at not recognizing that, whereas, you know, Shah's

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:42.280
[Amit Varma]: drift seems to be that he and Modi are more of true believers and those guys were so so

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:47.560
[Guest]: any I think that's right, but that still goes to the demand, at least in part amid the demand

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:52.920
[Guest]: side part of the argument, look, the creation of a unified Hindu vote bank today, right,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:59.080
[Guest]: which is that is really the big story of 21st century India, where the BJP is not an upper

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.160
[Unknown]: class party, because an upper class party could get 20% of the votes, right?

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.960
[Unknown]: Many of my left liberal friends go on and on about how and I'm saying, look, if it's

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.200
[Unknown]: up, I think they don't know if it's an upper class party that you're not going to win a

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.880
[Unknown]: single election in India.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:16.120
[Guest]: You can't, you know, and if you wear a mask for 100 years, you end up with an OBC prime

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.240
[Guest]: minister and a Dalit president.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:24.720
[Guest]: And that consolidation that the BJP is having, for example, in the 2019 elections, Modi won

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:30.360
[Guest]: more Dalit, OBC and tribal than anyone else, right than anyone else with a plurality than

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.360
[Guest]: anyone else.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:36.280
[Guest]: This is the big story to me of the 20th of the late 20th and early 20th century, because

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.520
[Unknown]: that changes the nature radically changes the nature of politics, including the supply

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:46.240
[Guest]: side, you know, a lot of the supply of politics in India is premised on the fact that no group

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.960
[Guest]: in no voting group in India is more than 15-16%, you know, and a lot of the politics is based

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:57.320
[Guest]: on that presumption and the kind of internal party coalitions you can get or external coalitions.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:02.040
[Guest]: Now, given that, you know, that social reality is changing in India, you're going to get

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.640
[Guest]: a very different form of politics.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:08.480
[Guest]: Part of the reason that social reality has changed is a hundred year project of the RSS

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.600
[Guest]: because as I point out, you know, from the 1920s itself, Savarkar understands that the

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.760
[Guest]: social unification of Hindus has an immediate electoral benefit.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:23.480
[Guest]: So in other words, political individualism, right, can be used if you have a social majority.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.000
[Guest]: He understands that, right.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.160
[Guest]: So part of it is the work of the RSS, etc, etc.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.800
[Guest]: But part of it, I mean, they are ground up forces like urbanization, right, where you

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:38.400
[Guest]: have, you know, Hindus of various castes moving from the village to the city, and their caste

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.920
[Guest]: identity gets diluted just a little bit, but their religious identity gets heightened,

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:47.560
[Guest]: you know, you're seeing that, and that is not, that is likely to be a modernization

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:51.360
[Guest]: story, which is a bottom-up story rather than just top-down, right.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.240
[Unknown]: And so while I hear you, right, that leaders matter, I mean, I mean, you know, this is

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.120
[Guest]: my second kind of biography.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:04.240
[Guest]: But in this book, I'm much more alive to the fact that, you know, the story of Hindu nationalism

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:10.200
[Guest]: is a story of Indians and of Indians changing as much as it is a supply-side story.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.720
[Amit Varma]: So I'm fascinated by something you just said, which is, of course, I mean, one is a truism

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.240
[Amit Varma]: that caste identities do get diluted a little bit when you come to cities, because larger

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.040
[Amit Varma]: economic networks, greater costs of discrimination and all of that.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.640
[Amit Varma]: But you also said that religious identities get heightened.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.640
[Amit Varma]: Now why is that?

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.960
[Amit Varma]: Is that sort of because of the ghettoization that can sometimes happen within cities or,

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.520
[Guest]: you know, can you explain that for me?

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.840
[Guest]: You know, Amit, one of the things I take very seriously as a researcher is that if you haven't

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.800
[Guest]: researched something, don't give gyaan, you know.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.720
[Guest]: And this is something that I have as a kind of background music in the book, right.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.440
[Guest]: And it's based on secondary sources.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.640
[Unknown]: It's not primary work that I did, like I did like about 200 interviews.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.000
[Guest]: You know, I did a lot of archival work, both, you know, the party archives as well.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.840
[Guest]: But this is something that, and frankly, I don't think there's very good material to

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.320
[Guest]: understand what you said.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.200
[Guest]: It's a reality that is unfolding in our eyes.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.480
[Guest]: So I have some access to secondary literature, but I, you know, I would rather like, you

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.640
[Guest]: know, tell the listener something that I know confidently rather than speculate, you know.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.440
[Guest]: So I can sense it.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.400
[Unknown]: And I think we, you know, academics typically take about 10, 15 years after you send something

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.720
[Unknown]: to come up with the answer.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:27.400
[Guest]: But I think it's the big question in India today, you know, which is the social basis

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.200
[Guest]: for the dominance of the BJP.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:35.360
[Guest]: And too many people who tend to portray Modi as just a fascist, you know, as just like,

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.800
[Guest]: you know, an event manager, they miss that this is the raw power of Hindu nationalism.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:44.120
[Guest]: And I think, you know, maybe this is the next project that I focus on, which is to look

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.000
[Guest]: at the social basis of Hindu political unity as it were.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.160
[Guest]: But at least for me, I mean, it's a bit early for me to sort of speak confidently.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.160
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:58.200
[Amit Varma]: I'll take this opportunity to book a session with you in advance for 2035.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.800
[Amit Varma]: So when you have figured this out, kindly, kindly come on my show.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.840
[Amit Varma]: And let us all know, let's now you know, after these little digressions, and we'll come back

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.320
[Amit Varma]: to this to discuss all of this in much more detail.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.360
[Amit Varma]: I want to go back to your personal life, because it strikes me that, you know, the work one

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.200
[Amit Varma]: does is shaped by the training that one gets and the experiences one has.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.960
[Amit Varma]: And that in turn, then, you know, the work one does shapes one as a person.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.400
[Amit Varma]: So now you've done all these different things, you're first trained in law, then you go into

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.640
[Amit Varma]: journalism, then you go into political science and all of this.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.560
[Amit Varma]: Then you write these books.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.120
[Amit Varma]: What's been the impetus behind all of this?

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:37.040
[Amit Varma]: Like, have there been these big problems driving you or have you just moved on from interest

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.280
[Amit Varma]: to interest at different points in time when you've fallen in love with something else

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.280
[Amit Varma]: to do?

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.640
[Amit Varma]: Like, why did you become a journalist?

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.800
[Amit Varma]: Why did you then stop being a journalist?

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Give me a sense of that journey.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.520
[Guest]: Oh, it's love and passion.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.400
[Guest]: I mean, you know, it's not like logically done.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.400
[Guest]: So for example, after this book, and already like it's not sales wise doing very, very

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.400
[Guest]: well, even though it's been only a week, there'll be tremendous pressure on me to write on like

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.960
[Guest]: Sonia Gandhi or something like that.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.840
[Guest]: And look, if I don't have passion about it, or if I don't see a light at the end of the

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:08.040
[Guest]: tunnel, I just know because here's the thing, you know, when you when the book comes out,

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.960
[Guest]: you know, I keep telling my students also, you get all this publicity, you know, you

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.760
[Guest]: get to come on podcast show, but that's really like one month of fun for three years of like

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.120
[Guest]: really boring work.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:23.000
[Guest]: So unless you're driven by passion, you know, for the subject itself, you can't sustain

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.560
[Guest]: yourself and also, I mean, readers come to know, you know, they come to know very quickly

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.560
[Unknown]: whether you're trying to sell them a lemon, or you're actually passionate about a subject,

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.280
[Unknown]: you know, and even if people disagree, they realize that you're genuinely motivated, they

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.440
[Guest]: can't read us again, and readers can sense this very well, you know.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:46.040
[Guest]: So I've always, I mean, at least the way I've seen myself is that if I like an idea, I try

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.040
[Guest]: to do it.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:51.720
[Guest]: For example, you know, given my academic career, you know, the logical pressure should be I

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.920
[Guest]: should, you know, publish in obscure journals, you know, I should that kind of thing.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.360
[Guest]: But if it doesn't give me happiness, I find I'm not very good at it.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:03.640
[Guest]: So I might as well do something I'm passionate about, because I can sustain myself and I'm

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.640
[Guest]: good at it.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.640
[Guest]: Right?

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.080
[Guest]: I think, you know, I went into National Law School Bangalore, because, you know, frankly,

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.920
[Guest]: after my 12th standard, I didn't, you know, the first question from middle class background

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.920
[Guest]: is, do you want to be an engineer?

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.920
[Unknown]: Do you want to be a doctor?

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.920
[Unknown]: Right?

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.680
[Unknown]: And, you know, if you don't want to be any of this, you know, how about a chartered accountant,

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.760
[Guest]: right, give you a little bit of added flavor to your life.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.600
[Guest]: And I didn't want to be any of this, right.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:28.920
[Guest]: And then my dad, who was, you know, totally chilled out on the matter, he got the National

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.280
[Guest]: Law School Bangalore entrance test, and it had a lot of GK, you know, quiz questions.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.000
[Guest]: And I always like quizzing and stuff like that.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.880
[Guest]: I said, Look, if the entrance test is any judge, this is what I want to do, you know,

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.880
[Guest]: so I did it.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:45.000
[Guest]: But I always thought of it as a good undergraduate degree, and I was kind of a refuge from, you

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.080
[Guest]: know, being forced to become an engineer in some sense.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.840
[Guest]: And the benefit of National Law School Bangalore is that by the time I joined it, thanks to

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.440
[Guest]: liberalization, etc, there were these fancy corporate law jobs, which at that time were

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.840
[Guest]: giving something like a lakh a month at that time, right, or maybe a little less.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.760
[Guest]: And so that gave me confidence that look, even if I fool around with this that I don't

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.960
[Unknown]: want to do, I'll, you know, maybe I won't get a great corporate law job, maybe I won't

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.040
[Guest]: be unhappy, but it gives a sense of security, right.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.560
[Guest]: And these kinds of security is very important when you want to, you know, pick especially

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.920
[Guest]: in India.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.360
[Guest]: So I finished law, and I've done quite a few internships when I was in National Law School

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.360
[Guest]: Bangalore.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.480
[Guest]: And, I mean, I'd gone to court and all and I'd worked, I'd done a corporate law internship,

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:30.080
[Guest]: I'd done an education internship, then none of it really excited me, you know, and I think

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.400
[Unknown]: I must really thank my parents that, you know, that, you know, when relatives or friends

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.600
[Guest]: would ask, what do you want to do?

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.640
[Guest]: And I didn't have an answer, it did not make my parents anxious, you know, they just let

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.520
[Unknown]: me kind of breathe.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:48.200
[Guest]: But the one thing that law taught me, I mean, was the focus on getting facts and sequence

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.200
[Guest]: right.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.800
[Guest]: For example, you just pointed out, you know, the way I asked the question, who killed Mahatma

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.800
[Unknown]: Gandhi?

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.800
[Guest]: Right?

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.040
[Guest]: Now, it's like, my legal training has hugely helped that, which is to look at the judgments,

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.040
[Guest]: right?

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.600
[Guest]: To make an assessment of the difference between Hindu Mahasabha and RSS, right?

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.360
[Guest]: And Savarkar, because that's a separate question, right?

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.320
[Guest]: And look at the various, you know, forum in which Savarkar was judged, right, including

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.800
[Guest]: in 1966, much after his death, etc, etc.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.520
[Guest]: That is definitely my legal training, you know, and I'm proud that both this book and

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:25.480
[Guest]: the Naseem Arao book is broadly bulletproof, in that you can't, you know, that no, I'm

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.400
[Guest]: sure you have disagreements, Amit, about the book, but there aren't facts there that you

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:34.240
[Guest]: will, you know, easy bloopers, easy facts, all of that is the obsession with legal training.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.760
[Guest]: And to give you an example, I mean, lots of people read drafts of this book, including

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.160
[Guest]: four or five of my close law friends.

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:44.200
[Guest]: And these are friends who charge like 60,000 rupees for an hour of reading, you know, that's

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:49.920
[Guest]: basically, so their eye is very, very good for detail, you know, and I would say I'm

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:56.000
[Guest]: a bad version of that, which is that I don't, you know, my value is not 60,000 rupees for

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.280
[Guest]: an hour of reading, but certainly an eye for the detail of the text, getting the facts

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.080
[Guest]: right, crossing the T's, dotting the I's, and look, you know, as controversial a topic

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.440
[Guest]: like this, Amit, it's very important, because ultimately, it's what builds credibility with

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:15.200
[Guest]: the reader, which is, to me, everything about writing a book, that I think my legal training

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.200
[Guest]: is very good.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.080
[Guest]: I ran away from the law and etc, etc.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:23.000
[Guest]: But if I could give my view to it, it's an obsession with facts, obsession with getting

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.640
[Guest]: it right, you know, an obsession with exercising judgment on facts that are not 100%, because

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:34.080
[Guest]: lawyers sometimes have to reconstruct a little bit based on a preponderance of evidence,

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.080
[Guest]: right?

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.840
[Guest]: So I noticed that sensibility is very much a lawyer's sensibility.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:43.520
[Guest]: That said, I hope Amit, you know, you can tell your listeners that I don't write like

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:48.040
[Guest]: a lawyer, I hope you can say that, that comes from my journalism, I spent a couple of years

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.400
[Guest]: working for Indian Express.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.960
[Guest]: And I was editing a lot of people's work.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.960
[Guest]: So that part of the book, which is that, you know, you open the book, and then I want you

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:02.120
[Guest]: to kind of not put the book down, that's my name, right.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.200
[Guest]: And all of that comes from journalism, for sure.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.600
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, I mean, I will, in fact, tell my listeners that this is a wonderfully readable

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.600
[Amit Varma]: book.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.600
[Amit Varma]: And indeed, you know, unputdownable for me, I did read it in sort of two stretches.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:19.680
[Amit Varma]: My other question is that this book is also very interesting, because it's simultaneously

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.120
[Amit Varma]: a work of history and journalism, in the sense that it's covering a political movement that's

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.820
[Amit Varma]: been 100 years in the making.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.420
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, that political movement is at its peak now.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:33.200
[Amit Varma]: And some of his protagonists are at their peak now, though, of course, it's, you know,

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:38.200
[Amit Varma]: it's a book about the BJP before Modi, but yet he does play a significant part, sort

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.600
[Amit Varma]: of towards the end of it.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.680
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, in terms of you've already spoken about how your legal training helped

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:50.560
[Amit Varma]: you in the work that you did, and in the rigor that that gave you, now give me a sense of

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:54.560
[Amit Varma]: how you went about doing this book and how journalistic rigor and academic rigor came

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.560
[Amit Varma]: together.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.920
[Amit Varma]: And what is, you know, in your process of writing the book, how different was it from

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:04.480
[Amit Varma]: how a pure journalist would approach it or a pure academic would approach it, though

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.680
[Amit Varma]: one could argue that in these days, neither of them can be pure, but you get what I'm

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.680
[Guest]: saying?

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.680
[Guest]: Yeah, no.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:14.640
[Guest]: So let me first begin by saying that, I think journalism really taught me two things, which

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.560
[Guest]: has helped me in this book and the previous one.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:23.200
[Guest]: The first thing Amit is that it taught me to, it really taught me that the story is

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.320
[Guest]: more important than you are, right, or that story is more important than I am.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:31.000
[Guest]: And this is something that academics don't get, that the reality is not created in their

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.800
[Guest]: mind, in their university, in their ivory tower, there is a reality out there and, you

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:40.960
[Guest]: know, we have a variety of tools to try to understand that reality, make sense of that.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.200
[Guest]: We have to be very humble, very, very humble about that.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:49.200
[Guest]: And so I told myself that, look, if I'm writing a book on a BJP, my view on the BJP is irrelevant,

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.200
[Guest]: right?

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.160
[Guest]: And frankly, it's irrelevant to the reader, that's not why the reader is paying this money

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.160
[Guest]: and reading the book.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.680
[Guest]: And that the phenomena is bigger than I am.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:03.440
[Guest]: So to give you a very simple manifestation of that, the only person who has a bigger

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.320
[Guest]: ego than a source is the secretary of the source.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.560
[Guest]: And you know, we use a little bit of power, but we'll kind of make you know, and if you're

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.760
[Guest]: the kind of person who bristles at that, you know, who doesn't like the fact that some

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.600
[Guest]: junior functionary is making you wait for like two and a half hours, you know, in a

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.000
[Guest]: smelly empty room, then you shouldn't be in this business.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.560
[Guest]: And I learned that from journalism a lot, you know, I also learned Amit, because when

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:31.560
[Guest]: I worked for Indian Express, Shekhar Gupta was the editor-in-chief.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:37.480
[Guest]: And I'm sure many of your listeners see Cut the Clutter, which is his iconic show right

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.480
[Guest]: now.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:42.000
[Guest]: But he used to do that with us, we were all junior journalists there, and he used to kind

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.360
[Guest]: of just walk into the newsroom and tell us story after story after story, you know.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:51.480
[Guest]: And I think that really taught me that, look, there is a way in which you can tell deeper

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:55.960
[Guest]: truths about Indian politics through an anecdotal story style.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.160
[Guest]: And he really taught me the importance of having a worm's eye view, you know, that he

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.440
[Guest]: was in the room when Charan Singh was doing X, that kind of thing.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:07.400
[Guest]: And of course, it doesn't tell you much, but it also tells you a lot of things.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.480
[Guest]: In contrast to academia, it's very refreshing, it gives a freshness to it.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.720
[Guest]: And it gives a sense that, you know, something that you asked Amit right in the beginning

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:20.040
[Guest]: that the moment matters, that in any given moment, you know, what will happen next is

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.040
[Guest]: not fated.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.360
[Guest]: Sab likha hua nahi hai, you know, and he really, a story is really that, right, that A happened

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.040
[Guest]: and B happened and C happened, and A and B and C need not follow chronologically.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.800
[Guest]: If they did, then it's not a story, you know.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:38.280
[Guest]: So I think both that, I think Express and journalism taught me to respect that the story

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:43.000
[Guest]: is bigger than you and your prejudices, and the reader frankly doesn't care about me,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
[Guest]: you know, who am I?

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.280
[Guest]: And that's why in the main body of the book, I don't use the word I at all.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:52.120
[Unknown]: I don't, you know, and I know that, like, lots of people are taught to do this nowadays.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.880
[Guest]: And I realized that then you're just writing for five of your friends, you know, then just

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.280
[Guest]: send a private email, what are you writing a book for?

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.840
[Guest]: So I think it's, and looking back, I just, when I teach, I keep pushing this on my students

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.240
[Guest]: that, look, it's a hard thing to tell people, right?

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.600
[Guest]: You are irrelevant, your story is relevant.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:13.240
[Guest]: And the second thing is, I think Shekhar Gupta taught me that to see politics like a worm,

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.440
[Guest]: you know, from the ground level.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.680
[Guest]: And that mattered hugely to me, right?

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.240
[Guest]: That said, I think, journalists tend to be very bad readers of text.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.640
[Guest]: So they're very good interviewers.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.560
[Guest]: But you know, when it comes to archives, when it comes to looking at text, when it comes

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.920
[Guest]: to even reading newspapers, one of the things I do in this book is from the late 19th century

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:38.800
[Guest]: itself, I refer to a lot of newspapers, journalists don't typically do that very well.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.600
[Guest]: And two is, I mean, I think journalists have a phobia from structural explanations.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.840
[Guest]: For them, everything is, you know, it goes the other extreme, everything is about like

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.040
[Guest]: the person, you know, like, it's all about Vajpayee, or it's all about Advani, right?

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:56.400
[Guest]: Or it's all about the particular head of the RSS at that time, rather than these boundaries,

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.840
[Guest]: structural forces that also matter.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.280
[Unknown]: So I think academia has definitely taught me that.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.080
[Guest]: And I studied at Princeton University, which is, I would say one of the most boring places

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.080
[Guest]: on earth.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:11.400
[Guest]: And looking back, you know, it's not a party town, at least for graduate students, it's

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.400
[Guest]: really boring.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:17.600
[Guest]: It's like, not very close to a big city also, maybe New York is about an hour and a half

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.600
[Guest]: away, two hours away.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:23.920
[Guest]: But what Princeton really taught me is that you got to take like academia, not as a as

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.880
[Guest]: a social event, but like as a professional thing.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.960
[Guest]: I think some people I know, coming to academia, because you know, they can wear like nice

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.680
[Guest]: kurtas and they can wear it, you know, it's a, it's an act of being, right?

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.320
[Guest]: Why would you want to kind of wear a tie and sell soap somewhere you should.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.400
[Guest]: And Princeton just drove that out of me, that it's a brutal place like you have, like academia

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.760
[Guest]: is about producing, it's about writing books, it's about writing articles, it's about going

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:53.340
[Guest]: to the archives, it's about creating data in a thoroughly unromantic way, you know,

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:56.880
[Guest]: so it totally took out the romance from from academia.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.600
[Guest]: And I would say that, on balance, it's a very good thing, you know, because this kind of

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.200
[Unknown]: stuff is hard work, and if you don't have the appetite for that, then you end up making

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.200
[Amit Varma]: mistakes.

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:10.840
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I love your book, not only for his fluid prose, but also for what you just said

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.480
[Amit Varma]: that I couldn't make out where you stood on any of the issues.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.840
[Amit Varma]: And I didn't really care.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.520
[Amit Varma]: Because the story was sort of riveting enough to keep me going.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:23.880
[Amit Varma]: Now, before we actually get to the book, one sort of final question, which sort of intrigues

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:29.040
[Amit Varma]: me because knowledge management is also something that I think about a fair bit, which is that,

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, do you have specific systems of knowledge management?

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.880
[Amit Varma]: Because you're doing a lot of archival work, you're, you know, you're digging up a lot

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:43.800
[Amit Varma]: of old sources as academics would at the same time, you're interviewing many people and,

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, so how do you organize all of that material?

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.520
[Amit Varma]: When does narrative sort of start to take shape?

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:55.000
[Amit Varma]: How do you avoid the danger, which you clearly have of having a preset narrative in your

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.640
[Guest]: head and then just finding the stuff that fits that?

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.520
[Guest]: You know, these are questions that I obsess about endlessly, because the process creates

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.520
[Guest]: the product.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.640
[Guest]: I mean, you know, there are very few mistakes in this book, because I created a process,

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.360
[Guest]: what you call knowledge management.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.920
[Guest]: And there's no shortcut to that.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.880
[Unknown]: There's just no, it's not that it, you know, this, I think, Arundhati Roy said that, you

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.720
[Guest]: know, when she began writing God of Small Things, she kind of began and then she ended,

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.720
[Guest]: right?

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.720
[Guest]: I don't think that works for most people.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.720
[Guest]: I go over, I see mistakes, so you create a process.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.800
[Guest]: For me, looking back, I mean, you know, when it happened, it happened intuitively, I would

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.320
[Guest]: divide my knowledge management process into three phases.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.600
[Guest]: The first phase is that I had this idea, right?

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.760
[Unknown]: And I began reading a lot around it, keeping an open mind, but reading what others have

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:41.760
[Unknown]: written about it.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.760
[Guest]: So, for example, after the Nassim Rao book, you know, I said, maybe I should think about

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.760
[Guest]: Vajpayee.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:50.960
[Guest]: And then I said, look, if you work on Vajpayee, I very quickly realized that Vajpayee and

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.200
[Guest]: Advani were two sides of the same coin.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:58.200
[Guest]: So I was open enough that, okay, I was initially interested in Vajpayee, and initially I bought

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.200
[Guest]: this idea that Vajpayee was this grand figure, right?

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:06.320
[Guest]: Which, look, he is, but I just, you know, the book, as you've read, is also critical

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.320
[Guest]: of him.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.320
[Unknown]: You know, it's not...

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:12.480
[Unknown]: So while he is this grand figure, he's a man who's highly complex, he has a lot of contradictions

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.480
[Guest]: within him.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.760
[Unknown]: So I'm glad I did that, which is I very quickly realized that it's actually a Jugalbandi story

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.440
[Guest]: of Vajpayee and Advani.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:24.040
[Guest]: And then I realized, Amit, that unlike in the case of Nassim Rao, who I think was single-handedly

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:29.840
[Unknown]: responsible for liberalization, Vajpayee and Advani's relationship cannot be understood

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.440
[Guest]: without the context, which is the movement, which is Hindu nationalism.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:38.760
[Guest]: And the rise of Vajpayee and Advani mirrors the rise of Hindu nationalism, so then that's

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.320
[Guest]: what became the structure of the book.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.960
[Guest]: But that was in my first phase of research where I'm kind of thinking about the idea

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:49.520
[Guest]: and I'm reading and constantly modifying what this original idea should be.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.680
[Guest]: So while teaching, for example, Amit, I taught three courses at Ashoka University that had

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:58.240
[Guest]: to do with parts of this, of Hindu nationalism, so that at least I could read what other people

00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.240
[Guest]: had written about it.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:03.520
[Guest]: That took, I would say, about a year or about seven, eight months, where I'm just talking,

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:08.040
[Guest]: I'm meeting for lunch, many of the people who have come on your podcast, like Pratap

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.760
[Guest]: Bhanu Mehta, for example, and I'm just shooting the breeze, you know, I'm like thinking about

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.840
[Guest]: it and you know, when you're thinking about academic questions, you're both asking, is

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.520
[Guest]: it a serious question?

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.520
[Guest]: Is it a fun question?

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.520
[Guest]: And is it a doable question?

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.520
[Guest]: The doable is really important.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.320
[Guest]: I mean, I have like the best research question, but I may not have sources, nobody may be

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.320
[Guest]: willing to open up.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:30.240
[Unknown]: Archives may be not there, in which case you should abandon the question, right?

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.240
[Guest]: So I spent about a year.

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:35.280
[Guest]: And at the end of that, Amit, I did something that I learned for the Nassim Mara book.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.360
[Guest]: I wrote a draft table of contents for the book.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:42.640
[Guest]: I said, look, it'll be 300 pages, each chapter will be 30 pages, and I wrote it.

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.520
[Guest]: Now, this sounds absurd, right?

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:49.880
[Guest]: But what it did is immediately from this abstract idea, the book became like a physical thing.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.760
[Guest]: And I said, look, ultimately, I have a physical thing.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.400
[Guest]: Ultimately, it has to be 30 pages.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:59.400
[Guest]: And I remember, you know, somebody telling me this when I was doing my PhD, that, you

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:04.560
[Guest]: know, the biggest advice he gave was think in chapters, which is a nice advice, because

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.840
[Guest]: otherwise you have the romance of an idea without how do you actually execute it, right?

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:13.040
[Guest]: Now, the key here, Amit, is something that you pointed out, which is that you shouldn't

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.320
[Guest]: be too wedded to your initial ideas.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.920
[Guest]: So while I wrote this table of contents, which is like a rough structure of what the book

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:23.840
[Guest]: is going to look like, I was very comfortable that the moment I found more evidence, I should

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.720
[Guest]: change chapters, remove them, etc, etc, right?

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.960
[Guest]: Now, having done that, Amit, what I did was that I went to the second phase, which is

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:35.720
[Guest]: I would call research, which is I started both reading secondary material, which is

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.440
[Guest]: books and articles written by others, and fitting them into these chapters.

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.400
[Guest]: So I used to have separate Word documents for each chapter.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.160
[Guest]: And then I have Word documents for sections within each chapter.

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.840
[Guest]: Now, why this is helpful, Amit, is two ways.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.760
[Guest]: One is that when you're going to the archive, you're looking for something, right?

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.800
[Guest]: Otherwise, you know, you see, you know, you see, like, you know, 6000 pages, you don't

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.160
[Guest]: know which needle to look in the haystack, right?

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.360
[Guest]: So you go in with a hypothesis.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.720
[Unknown]: And second is that when I'm reading something, I'm immediately being productive and say,

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.560
[Guest]: okay, you know, this has come in this chapter, or this is going to come in this space, which

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.080
[Guest]: is quite, you know, so it saves a lot of time.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:15.440
[Guest]: Otherwise, I realized, Amit, from the time I was doing my PhD, that because research

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:20.280
[Guest]: tends to be open ended, you could spend 50% of your time researching on something that

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.320
[Guest]: is only 10% of the book.

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.360
[Guest]: And some of that quote, unquote, wastage is inevitable.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.360
[Unknown]: That's what happens.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.880
[Unknown]: You have to go down some blind alleys when you're doing research.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:32.000
[Guest]: But you should avoid going down too many blind alleys, right?

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.120
[Guest]: That said, the biggest problem of this approach is that you may end up with a predetermined

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.120
[Guest]: outcome.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.640
[Guest]: So you know, to use the popular phrase, when it comes to writing, you should be happy to

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.640
[Guest]: kill your babies.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.920
[Guest]: The moment you realize, you know, you may have this great idea, you may have spent a

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.840
[Guest]: month kind of telling yourself, yeah, this is how the BJP work.

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:54.440
[Guest]: But if an evidence points otherwise, you have to say, I'm sorry, I was wrong, you know.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:59.160
[Unknown]: And if you don't do that, then the reader is able to smell very quickly is your opinions

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:03.880
[Guest]: and conclusions driven from the evidence you provide, or are you trying to sell me something

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:09.080
[Guest]: and in this age amid the post fact world, everybody is using facts to actually sell

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.080
[Guest]: an agenda.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.720
[Guest]: And I think readers are totally inured from it, very irritated with it.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:18.200
[Guest]: So I was very, very sensitive that the moment the evidence or somebody told me something,

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:23.280
[Guest]: some archive, some newspaper gave me a slightly different view, I should present it like to

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.280
[Unknown]: give you one example.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:29.280
[Unknown]: You know, I came in with the standard view that, you know, Vajpayee the moderate, Advani

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.280
[Unknown]: the hardliner.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:34.240
[Guest]: And I very quickly realized that Advani's background is exceedingly complex.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:38.240
[Guest]: He's like most of the listeners of this podcast, a Macaulay Putra, somebody who speaks English

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.240
[Guest]: as the first language.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:45.360
[Guest]: He grew up to enormous wealth in Karachi, his family had a game room, huge house, they

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.080
[Guest]: had a Victoria horse driven carriage, you know, he was playing tennis when someone told

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:53.320
[Guest]: him about the RSS, who joins the RSS after a tennis game.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:57.840
[Unknown]: And he wouldn't have joined RSS had it not been for the looming catastrophe of partition,

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:04.320
[Guest]: which splits his hometown and makes his rich family near poverty, enter near poverty.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:08.520
[Guest]: So immediately when I realized that, I realized that I had to change this original idea of

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:14.880
[Guest]: a classic jugalbandhi between a moderate and a hardliner, because it was much more complex.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:19.200
[Guest]: So that's again, I think something where journalism has helped me saying that you can't be wedded

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.200
[Guest]: to your own ideas.

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:26.040
[Guest]: If this is the famous John Maynard Keynes line, when the facts change, I change my mind,

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.720
[Guest]: what do you do, sir?

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:32.000
[Guest]: So that's the second stage, Amit, which is research.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.280
[Guest]: And then what I have learned to do is to start writing quicker rather than later.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:42.920
[Guest]: Because there is this sense I realized that perfection is the enemy of production.

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.880
[Guest]: And a lot of academics and researchers are saying that, look, I have to now read four

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:51.320
[Guest]: more books before I start writing, or I have to look at interview three more people before

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.320
[Guest]: I start writing.

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.320
[Guest]: That will never happen.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:57.720
[Guest]: You'll spend your whole life trying to do this, this mythic sense of completion.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:03.520
[Guest]: So what I learned was that, and my brother who's an MBA, he works for an FMCG, he's a

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:07.680
[Guest]: big influence on my life, and he's extremely focused on delivery.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.160
[Guest]: And he's saying, look, write the chapter, he told me, and whatever you haven't done

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.960
[Guest]: research, leave it blank.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.720
[Unknown]: So that when you go for your second round of research, you're only looking to fill in

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:17.720
[Guest]: the blank.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:21.840
[Unknown]: And I found that a very, very helpful technique, because right with the material you have,

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.280
[Unknown]: let's say it's about 70% of the material that you should have.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:29.320
[Guest]: But you know, to use consultancy speak, ring fence the problem.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:34.120
[Guest]: So right there, the paragraphs which are hollow, and then do a second round of research, because

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.840
[Guest]: once you have written, you can see the holes in the chapter.

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.400
[Guest]: And when you do that, it may change even more.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.160
[Guest]: So I would broadly say that, you know, when you said knowledge management, these are the

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:48.240
[Guest]: three different phases, and at least so far, it's helped me in good stead.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:53.480
[Guest]: But you know, in some cases, I have made mistakes, so hopefully the next book will be a refinement

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.480
[Guest]: of this process.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.320
[Amit Varma]: No, that's a fantastic quote about perfection being the enemy of production.

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:04.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, I teach a writing course, where I constantly sort of tell my students that,

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:08.120
[Amit Varma]: you know, for anything you do in life, there are these two imperatives, getting it done

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.360
[Amit Varma]: and getting it right.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.600
[Amit Varma]: And your first priority has to be to get it done.

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:16.400
[Amit Varma]: And once you get it done, then you edit, edit, edit, then you chisel it down and get it right.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:21.040
[Amit Varma]: And very often just getting it done, the process of iteration and reiteration will get it right,

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.440
[Amit Varma]: but that's the only way to do it.

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.360
[Amit Varma]: So that strikes a chord with me.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:29.160
[Amit Varma]: My last sort of question about your working methods before we get to the book itself is,

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:35.400
[Amit Varma]: what is the process like of then getting people to talk to you about this period of time and

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:39.800
[Amit Varma]: some of whom I presume are people who would even in the current day be fairly important?

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, how do you get access? how do you get their trust?

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:47.080
[Amit Varma]: And then is there a sort of this psychological pressure that these people who have trusted

00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:50.400
[Amit Varma]: you and been so nice to you, you have to make them look good also?

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:54.800
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, how does that whole process sort of work?

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:59.000
[Guest]: There's no psychological pressure on me to make them look good, because their narrative

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.440
[Guest]: has already made them look good.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:07.600
[Guest]: You know, everyone in their story is the hero or heroine of their own story.

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:11.800
[Guest]: Some people do it obviously, some people aren't even aware that they're doing it, you know.

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.320
[Guest]: So this is like, you have to deal with this and it's hard.

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:19.640
[Unknown]: But you know, it's a hard question, because there's no simple answer to it.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:24.120
[Guest]: If it was simple answer, then, you know, anybody could see this podcast and become the world's

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.120
[Guest]: best journalist.

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:29.480
[Guest]: And I'm not a good journalist, but my two years in journalism made me look at the best

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.480
[Guest]: and look at how they try to answer this question, right?

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.480
[Guest]: Like, how do you cultivate a source?

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.320
[Guest]: How do you make people trust you?

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:40.720
[Guest]: Because in India, especially, there's no shortage of people who want to speak.

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.720
[Guest]: Everybody has a story.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:42.720
[Guest]: Everybody wants to give gyaan.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.520
[Guest]: The issue is, do they trust you?

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.520
[Guest]: That's the issue.

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:52.120
[Guest]: And luckily for me, my first book, I had again interviewed a ton of people, and I was very

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.120
[Guest]: careful about it.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:57.720
[Guest]: In that I sent out emails to everybody after, you know, just before the book was coming,

00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:00.440
[Guest]: saying, look, this is the paragraph you have been quoted.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:05.000
[Guest]: So not only did I ask their permission for their quotes, I gave them the two sentences

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.920
[Guest]: above and two sentences below, right?

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:10.760
[Guest]: And I think that, you know, this is, you know, from whether it's Prime Minister Manmohan

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.680
[Guest]: Singh, or it's like the doctor of Narsimha Rao, I use the same rule.

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.680
[Guest]: I didn't change that.

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:16.680
[Guest]: Right.

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.680
[Guest]: And I realized that that brings credibility, that people realize that look, speak, I don't

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.680
[Guest]: record.

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.680
[Guest]: So I write down.

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.680
[Guest]: So I have nothing to hold on.

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.600
[Guest]: So, you know, later on, if they deny, I'm screwed, right?

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.480
[Guest]: They know that, that helps build trust.

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:33.080
[Guest]: And so when really their consent happens, when I send them an email later, and they

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.320
[Guest]: say, yes, quote ABC and don't quote X, Y, Z.

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.320
[Guest]: And this happens all the time.

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:41.440
[Guest]: I mean, and also people speak very freely, but seven, eight months later, when I'm actually

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.840
[Guest]: sending them big quotes, things, their life circumstances have changed, and suddenly they

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:46.840
[Guest]: develop cold feet.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:51.440
[Unknown]: And I think one of the things I regret in the book is the number of names I could tell

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:55.440
[Guest]: you would add even more credibility to the book, you know, like, it would blow your mind

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.440
[Guest]: up.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:59.840
[Guest]: But I just, and you know, I'm just, I'm just bursting to tell you that, you know, you know,

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.760
[Unknown]: there are already, there are maybe about less, a little less than a hundred names that are

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:08.400
[Guest]: quoted, but the hundred names that are not quoted, maybe even more like, you know, juicy,

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.400
[Guest]: but I just can't do it.

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:13.920
[Guest]: You know, if I do it, nobody will talk to me for my third book, nobody.

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:19.040
[Guest]: And the other thing I've noticed that happens is that if you don't know somebody, so definitely

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:23.520
[Guest]: my previous book added to the credibility that, look, I'm not looking for a gotcha moment,

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.520
[Guest]: right?

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:25.520
[Guest]: I'm not looking to trap you.

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.080
[Guest]: And then you'll come in the newspaper, that kind of thing.

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:32.160
[Guest]: But equally in India, somebody has to vouch for you.

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.160
[Guest]: Somebody has to.

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:37.760
[Guest]: So, you know, I meet an older person or something like that, who may not have heard of my, the

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:41.200
[Guest]: previous book, somebody who they trust has to trust me.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.200
[Guest]: That's the only way they do it.

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:46.600
[Guest]: Otherwise, yeah, maybe it's just an Indian trade, because that's in some sense, the heart

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:51.480
[Guest]: of my book that Indians lack teamwork and the BJP does it well, that everybody's suspicious

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:54.920
[Guest]: if somebody, you know, of somebody just coming and asking you questions.

00:54:54.920 --> 00:55:00.280
[Guest]: I mean, look at how rudely Indians treat salesmen, Eureka salesmen who ring your bell, right?

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.080
[Guest]: And come to try to sell you something on your door.

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.080
[Unknown]: We don't like it.

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.080
[Guest]: We don't like strangers.

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.800
[Guest]: So, you have to have somebody to vouch for you.

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.680
[Guest]: And then the third thing I realized, I mean, is that you have to come for an interview

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:11.680
[Guest]: well prepared.

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:16.600
[Guest]: You know, you can't use the source or the interviewer for the basic material, right?

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.600
[Guest]: That's important.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.280
[Guest]: Then people begin to respect you.

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.640
[Guest]: They said, okay, he's come prepared, you know.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:25.040
[Guest]: So I would say, you know, these were some of the skills I use, but I don't, there's

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.600
[Guest]: no formula for this.

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:31.080
[Guest]: It's the same question I'm asking in any relationship with your spouse, with your friends, with

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.080
[Guest]: your parents.

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.080
[Guest]: How do you build trust?

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:38.760
[Guest]: And frankly, for me, 50% is building trust with the source and 50% is building trust

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:39.760
[Guest]: with the leader.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.560
[Unknown]: And it's actually the same thing, which is that, you know, everybody realizes that you

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.000
[Unknown]: have an angle.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.200
[Unknown]: Everybody realizes that you come in with biases, but be honest about it, come well prepared

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:54.120
[Guest]: and don't try to take advantage of somebody's being nice or trusting you.

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.840
[Unknown]: And then in India, that is such a deficit that even if you do a little of it, then,

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:01.160
[Unknown]: you know, people, they want to tell you everything about your life and I actually want to leave

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:06.560
[Guest]: for lunch, you know, so, but there's no formula for that.

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:09.640
[Amit Varma]: And definitely that comes from my journalism, right?

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:14.560
[Amit Varma]: Also the other thing that I sort of wanted to ask you was that comes to mind is that

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:18.880
[Amit Varma]: you've mentioned about how, you know, perfection is the enemy of production.

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:23.840
[Amit Varma]: So obviously your first impulse is to get it done, you know, to get it out on paper.

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.800
[Amit Varma]: What's your process like after you have a first draft done?

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.760
[Amit Varma]: Like one thing you mentioned is you've got paragraphs and you've got holes in them, or

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, within a chapter, you've got holes, you know that, okay, that's where I need to

00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:35.920
[Amit Varma]: go back and get the research done.

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:39.520
[Amit Varma]: But once you have all the material and you've gotten that first draft, what's the process

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.520
[Amit Varma]: of editing like?

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:45.840
[Amit Varma]: Do you ever end up restructuring the book itself, or the chapters themselves in significant

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.840
[Amit Varma]: ways?

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.320
[Amit Varma]: How much time do they take vis-a-vis one another?

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:54.320
[Guest]: You know, Amit, I spend a lot of time thinking about the editing process because, you know,

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:59.480
[Guest]: my wife teaches creative writing, exactly what you do, and she's drilled into me that

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:03.960
[Guest]: look, the first draft is actually quite liberating because it's going to look nothing like the

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.160
[Guest]: final draft.

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:09.240
[Guest]: So don't worry about putting something on paper because have the confidence that it's

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.920
[Guest]: only draft number 18 that is going to go.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.800
[Guest]: And there's a huge difference between draft one and draft 18.

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.880
[Guest]: So that's actually quite liberating, right?

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.520
[Guest]: Because otherwise, you're worried that if you put something on paper, it has to be perfect.

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.520
[Guest]: It doesn't.

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:24.480
[Guest]: And I've really learned a lot from that idea of hers.

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:30.320
[Guest]: And it's like, I, you know, I write and look, when I think I may not, you know, you don't

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.320
[Unknown]: begin at the beginning, right?

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.920
[Unknown]: The human mind is not, doesn't begin a story at the beginning, you typically begin the

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.240
[Unknown]: story in the middle.

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:40.520
[Guest]: And so I write it and then only later I find out what should be the first paragraph that

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.200
[Guest]: kind of draws the reader in.

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:46.200
[Guest]: I'm sure you've done exactly this when you were in Cricinfo, Amit, that you have to edit

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.200
[Guest]: other people's work.

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:51.360
[Guest]: The material is there, but you want to kind of make the bread rise just a little bit.

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:52.360
[Unknown]: And that's your job as an editor.

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:57.520
[Unknown]: And I think in Express, I wasn't just a journalist, I was also like a copy editor, where I was

00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:00.120
[Guest]: editing other people's op-ed page submissions.

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.440
[Guest]: So I should change the voice of that person.

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:06.320
[Guest]: But how do I kind of have a better beginning, have a better end, right?

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:10.240
[Guest]: George Orwell has been a huge influence on me of this.

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:15.080
[Guest]: He has a, I think, Politics in the English Language, an extraordinary essay where he

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:20.160
[Guest]: tells you what to avoid, which is don't use a word if it's not required, right?

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.280
[Guest]: Make sure that every sentence follows from the previous one.

00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.400
[Guest]: And another one of my writing gurus has been V.S. Naipaul.

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:30.880
[Guest]: And if you look at, forget his politics for just a second, but he's one of the great stylists

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.880
[Guest]: of prose in the 20th century.

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:39.200
[Guest]: He used to write very short sentences, and each sentence, he made sure that every sentence

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:42.360
[Guest]: had a next sentence that followed from that.

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.440
[Guest]: And if you remove that sentence, the paragraph would fall.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.440
[Unknown]: That was the test, right?

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:50.560
[Unknown]: That if you have a sentence there, that maybe you can remove that sentence and it will still

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:53.560
[Guest]: sort of tell the reader the same thing, then you should remove it.

00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:58.440
[Guest]: And that's what makes it kind of sparse and it forces you to, because what is the leader

00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.440
[Unknown]: getting in return?

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.840
[Guest]: The leader is getting in return the confidence that every word the leader is being forced

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.000
[Unknown]: to read has been worth it.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:12.440
[Unknown]: And the writer has spent a lot of energy not sending the reader down random rabbit holes.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:16.960
[Guest]: I'm not a very good writer, in a sense, I'm not a natural writer, so I'm a bit of a defensive

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.960
[Guest]: writer.

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:23.200
[Guest]: So what I try to do is use writing as a very light scaffolding so that I can tell the story.

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:28.080
[Guest]: I also know that about myself, that look, I'm not like the world's best prose stylist.

00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:32.920
[Guest]: So I'm defensive, I use short sentences, I use active voice.

00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:38.400
[Guest]: That's another thing that George Orwell stressed on, you know, and as far as possible, if there's

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:43.000
[Guest]: any meat, like I try to avoid starters and on three and that kind of stuff.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000
[Guest]: I give you the main course, right, in every sentence.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.840
[Guest]: And in other words, the sentence must be saying something.

00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:53.480
[Guest]: The other thing on editing I've learned a lot from BS Naipaul is that every sentence

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.880
[Guest]: must be capable of a couple of meanings, right?

00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:57.360
[Guest]: That's the power of a sentence.

00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:01.040
[Guest]: You know, I'll give you one example, I mean, which is that you must have noticed that the

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:06.840
[Guest]: book begins with an organization, a story of like an event that is being organized,

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:13.480
[Guest]: which is the 1995 November, BJP national executive in Bombay, in Shivaji Park, etc, etc, right?

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.480
[Guest]: And Mahalakshmi racecourse.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.840
[Guest]: And I spent time on the logistics, you know, that they were, you know, 10,000 people to

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:24.080
[Guest]: be fed, these many people were coming by boat, you know, I do that through the book, right?

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.920
[Guest]: But what I'm trying to do is give you the flavor of a movement that is obsessed with

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.040
[Guest]: this stuff without ever saying it, right?

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.040
[Guest]: Of course, I begin the story with Vajpayee Advani and Advani announcing Vajpayee's Prime

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.080
[Guest]: Minister, but I deliberately spend a lot of time telling you, for example, you know, I'm

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.320
[Guest]: just opening the book here.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:47.080
[Unknown]: And, you know, to give you this particular detail, which is that over 120,000 delegates

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:53.760
[Guest]: attended, this is the November 1995 event, BJP event in Bombay, some even by ship from

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.400
[Guest]: the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, right?

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.040
[Guest]: So this sentence has two meanings.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.960
[Guest]: One is, of course, it's a fun fact.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.160
[Guest]: But the deeper point I'm taking is that these guys win because they're obsessed with this

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.160
[Guest]: sort of organization.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.080
[Guest]: If I was writing a book on the Congress, I would not have this sentence.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:13.040
[Guest]: Congress also does organization, Congress also has events, right?

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:17.880
[Guest]: People do come from Andaman, Nicobar Islands, but it's not central to the self, you know,

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.160
[Guest]: the self-knowledge and the self-impression that the Congress has of itself.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.240
[Guest]: So that's what I mean that, you know, like a lot of sentences, if you play it right,

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.920
[Guest]: you're saying something, but you're also telling them something deeper.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.440
[Guest]: And that only comes through editing.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.920
[Guest]: It only comes through like, you know, going through multiple drafts.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:40.280
[Unknown]: The other thing I've learned, Amit, again, this is thanks to my wife, is that I try to

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.840
[Guest]: avoid cliches.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:47.320
[Guest]: So for example, I try to avoid saying it was a watershed moment, because a watershed actually

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:52.160
[Guest]: is a certain visual where, you know, the river comes from the mountain and at some point

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.600
[Amit Varma]: it hits a plane, and at the watershed, the river can go in multiple directions.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.840
[Guest]: So the technical use of watershed is an event, right, that can go in multiple directions,

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.840
[Guest]: right?

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.800
[Guest]: Whereas we use watershed today to mean an important event.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.800
[Guest]: That's not what it means.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:14.120
[Guest]: So if, but because it has become an overused cliche, then we keep using it without thinking.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.880
[Guest]: So the other thing I've learned is when I detect a cliche, I remove it.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.440
[Guest]: And I try to look for a synonym, or I like to look for another thing that communicates

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.440
[Unknown]: it.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.440
[Guest]: And, you know, there's all these thesauruses and dictionaries online.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.880
[Guest]: So life is quite easy.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:30.400
[Guest]: But none of this is conceivable in the first draft, this actually happens in the 8, 9,

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.400
[Guest]: 10 draft.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:35.920
[Guest]: And my only hope is that the reader realizes that all this effort is to make her happy,

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:41.120
[Guest]: you know, and, and that to me, I'm very clear that, you know, I have one boss in this book,

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.120
[Guest]: and that's the reader.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:47.320
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean, everything that you said strikes such a chord that all my writing students

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:52.840
[Amit Varma]: and listeners of this podcast will be wondering if I sat down in advance and all of this,

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.000
[Amit Varma]: but then, you know, as you said, your wife is a writing teacher, for example, you know,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.640
[Amit Varma]: when I used to be an editor in Pragati and elsewhere, whenever someone new would write

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.560
[Amit Varma]: for me, I'd first make them read politics in the English language.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.560
[Unknown]: It's just a seminal.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's not fixed at all.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.880
[Amit Varma]: And Orwell's essays, in fact, you know, what I consistently cite as my desert island book,

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.960
[Amit Varma]: it's a masterpiece.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.760
[Amit Varma]: And it's an interesting bit of trivia for you, since you mentioned active voice.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:24.440
[Amit Varma]: In his essay politics in the English language, Orwell warns against using passive voice twice.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.680
[Amit Varma]: And one of those times he does it in passive voice.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.680
[Amit Varma]: Oh, wow.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:28.680
[Amit Varma]: I didn't know that.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.680
[Amit Varma]: I did not know that.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.680
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's just a moment of irony, which I, and even what, you know, what you said about

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.280
[Amit Varma]: cliches, the interesting thing about, and of course, cliches are bad, because they don't

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.640
[Amit Varma]: invoke a fresh image and the reader's eyes glaze over, but they can also be inaccurate.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.680
[Amit Varma]: Like you said, watershed moment, and the cricketing example of that would be the ball sped to

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.800
[Amit Varma]: the boundary, like a tracer bullet.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.520
[Amit Varma]: And if anyone's actually seen a tracer bullet, they don't go the way Ravi Shastri thinks

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.520
[Guest]: they go.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.520
[Guest]: That's exactly right.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:04:00.720
[Guest]: And what that does, Amit, is what you mentioned, that if you're trying to communicate something

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.640
[Guest]: using a fresh image, the reader's eye doesn't glaze over, the reader pauses to see, right?

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.920
[Guest]: And then the image has that double power, you know, so from a diluted image, you end

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.720
[Guest]: up with a very concentrated image, because the reader hasn't heard that before, right?

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.680
[Guest]: So you know, just what would you say, just as an exercise, that if the ball went very

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.520
[Guest]: fast to the boundary, what would be a fresh image that communicates exactly what the ball

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.520
[Guest]: did?

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.520
[Guest]: You know, because you're the cricket man.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, well, right now, I can't think of something offhand, because I'd actually have to see

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:31.760
[Amit Varma]: it.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.280
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to comment on a hypothetical ball.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.840
[Amit Varma]: But the classic example I give is that sometimes an adjective in a particular context can be

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.840
[Amit Varma]: a cliche.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.760
[Amit Varma]: For example, all cover drives will be described as elegant.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.000
[Amit Varma]: But the point is that you can say that Virat Kohli played an elegant cover drive, or Rahul

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.560
[Amit Varma]: Rawat did, or Mark Waugh did.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.520
[Amit Varma]: And the truth is, it's accurate, because all the cover drives are elegant.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.440
[Amit Varma]: But it doesn't convey the particulars, they're very different from each other.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.880
[Guest]: And that's a writer's job to get to the heart of the difference.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:58.880
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.600
[Guest]: In fact, I try as much as possible to avoid adjectives and adverbs.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:08.080
[Guest]: You know, describe it, you know, don't say that he ran quickly, right?

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.280
[Guest]: Don't say that, you know, when he ran, the floor was creaking, or the floor made a lot

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.560
[Unknown]: of noise, something like that.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.480
[Guest]: So I tried, again, this is all defensive writing, because, you know, if you're a great writer,

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.680
[Guest]: you don't need to be told all this, you have an intuitive rhythm, I know I don't.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:27.760
[Unknown]: So I and again, when I in my first draft, and I'm sure it's the same with you Amit,

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.040
[Unknown]: we write like we talk.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:34.120
[Guest]: So we use cliches, you know, when we speak, our first reaction is imprecise.

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:40.200
[Guest]: But in all the further edits, I move it further and further away from the original bad way

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.720
[Guest]: in which I try to communicate it.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:48.640
[Guest]: So in that sense, it's a it is highly constructed, you know, that that sense of that sense of

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.800
[Guest]: sentences that I try at least to incorporate.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:56.680
[Guest]: By the way, thanks for this Amit, because I obsess hugely about the writing process.

01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:57.680
[Guest]: Right.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.560
[Guest]: And it's very, very important for me that a book like this is read, you know, far beyond

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:08.520
[Guest]: the confines of, or even the people who see this podcast, we don't want a very small intelligent

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:11.520
[Guest]: subset of policymakers or people interested in policy.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.520
[Guest]: So I wanted to be even broader, right.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:18.440
[Guest]: And at least so far, we're able to do it that, you know, right now on Amazon, I'm competing

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.440
[Guest]: with like word power made easy and Dale Carnegie, right.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:27.080
[Guest]: And to do that, especially for a topic that is this difficult, that you have to obsess

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.680
[Guest]: extra on the writing style.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.680
[Amit Varma]: No question.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:34.520
[Amit Varma]: But you know, that's especially important, because, you know, one thing again, my last

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:38.080
[Amit Varma]: compliment of your book, because I don't want to embarrass you, but, you know, Orwell once

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:41.680
[Amit Varma]: said good prose is like a windowpane, which means you should not notice it, it is just

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.680
[Amit Varma]: meant to show you what's on the other side.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.440
[Amit Varma]: And that's one of the qualities of your book to being a writer myself, I actually noticed

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.680
[Amit Varma]: quite a few superb sentences, which you came up with, but in a writerly sense, they don't

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:52.960
[Amit Varma]: draw attention to themselves.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.360
[Amit Varma]: But I noticed that maybe I'll get the chance to quote a couple of them as we go along.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:00.640
[Amit Varma]: And the other thing that you said is also resonant with me, because one of the things

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:07.000
[Amit Varma]: that I sort of emphasize when I talk about writing is that, especially in India, the

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.440
[Amit Varma]: way we speak English, we've internalized a lot of bad habits.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.760
[Amit Varma]: And the first task is to become mindful of them, and eliminate them.

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:19.800
[Amit Varma]: So in fact, one of the exercises I give my writing students is to write a specific piece,

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:26.000
[Amit Varma]: whatever the theme is, but without using adjectives or adverbs, which they complain about a lot

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.920
[Guest]: This is why EV Amit, I think we are on like a little, literally like 100% the same mind

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:31.920
[Guest]: on this.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.920
[Amit Varma]: Verbs are your best friend.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:38.720
[Amit Varma]: On that note, we will take to, you know, give you an active voice sentence, we will take

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:43.360
[Unknown]: a commercial break now.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.520
[Amit Varma]: As many of you know, I'll soon be coming out with a four volume anthology of the seen and

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:53.160
[Amit Varma]: the unseen books organized around the themes of politics, history, economics, and society

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.160
[Amit Varma]: and culture.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.480
[Amit Varma]: These days, I'm wading through over 3 million words of conversation from all my episodes

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.000
[Amit Varma]: so far to curate the best bits.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.920
[Amit Varma]: And for this to happen, I needed transcripts.

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:08.400
[Amit Varma]: And that was made possible by a remarkable young startup called Tapchief.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:13.960
[Amit Varma]: Tapchief at tapchief.com is a digital platform that allows companies to outsource work to

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.680
[Amit Varma]: their network of freelancers.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:20.400
[Amit Varma]: And Tapchief's network includes more than 125,000 people as of now.

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:25.080
[Amit Varma]: You want people to make your web page or design a logo or compose a jingle or do some digital

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:30.600
[Amit Varma]: marketing for you, Tapchief gives you an easy way to reach out to freelancers competing

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.680
[Amit Varma]: for your work.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:35.800
[Amit Varma]: I can say from firsthand experience how valuable this has been for me and solve the problem

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.880
[Amit Varma]: I was actually a bit worried about.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:43.140
[Amit Varma]: So do go over to tapchief.com and check out all that Tapchief has to offer.

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:47.400
[Amit Varma]: Maybe they could solve your problem too.

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:51.160
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen I'm chatting with Vinay Sitapati about his wonderful

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:59.160
[Amit Varma]: book Jugalbandi about the BJP before Narendra Modi and honestly tons of insight even on

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.720
[Amit Varma]: the current BJP all of which comes from the context that we get.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:08.200
[Amit Varma]: So I kind of want to go to the context that you sort of set in the start of the book about

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:13.740
[Amit Varma]: Hindu nationalism and the Hindu movement itself, where you point out that what any nationalism

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:20.600
[Amit Varma]: has to contend with is thinking of people, territory, state, and you speak about how

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:24.840
[Amit Varma]: they were notions of Hindu territory from the Vishnu Purana onwards.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.800
[Amit Varma]: But you know, as far as the Hindu people were concerned, there's no canonical book or institution.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:34.440
[Amit Varma]: You just have a bunch of, you know, a plethora of cultural practices as you put it.

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.720
[Amit Varma]: And you know, of course, there are arguments about historians, whether there was an actual

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:44.440
[Amit Varma]: Hindu consciousness till our colonial overlords came and sort of spread that narrative.

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:47.800
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, and the closest thing that came to a Hindu state was, of course, Shivaji's

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.800
[Amit Varma]: Maratha Kingdom.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, I want to sort of go to 1906 and 1909.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.920
[Amit Varma]: And one of the very interesting things that you point out, and again, it's an event in

01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:00.920
[Amit Varma]: history that has massive consequences and has literally shaped our country even today,

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:07.020
[Amit Varma]: which is the British conception of the sort of elections that they would have in India.

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:12.120
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the demographic anxiety that they lead to among Hindus here, can you elaborate

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.120
[Amit Varma]: on that a bit?

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.340
[Guest]: So, Amit, you've asked two questions, right?

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:20.280
[Guest]: One is the debate on who is a Hindu, what is Hinduism, right?

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:23.040
[Guest]: And why this is a very tough question to answer.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.480
[Guest]: The second question you asked is, what does elections do to that, right?

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.240
[Guest]: How does elections put unique pressure on trying to answer this question?

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:38.680
[Guest]: To come to the first one, Hinduism has 3,000 castes, as many sub-castes, so many different

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.840
[Guest]: languages and dialects, right?

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:45.480
[Guest]: So it has a lot of internal diversity, both theologically as well as in practice.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.960
[Guest]: To add to that, it doesn't have a Quran, it doesn't have an authoritative textbook, and

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.120
[Guest]: this cannot be emphasized.

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:57.320
[Guest]: Some people say it's the Vedas, but the Lingayat community of Karnataka is an anti-Vedic movement,

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.320
[Guest]: right?

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.320
[Guest]: They are Hindu, right?

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.680
[Guest]: And it also doesn't have an authoritative institution, unlike the Vatican.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:08.840
[Guest]: So therefore, a clear answer, an authoritative answer to the question, what is Hinduism or

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:11.160
[Guest]: who is a Hindu, is not available.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.160
[Guest]: That's not available.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:17.840
[Guest]: Nonetheless, I push back against, let's say, Marxist scholars who argue that therefore

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.840
[Guest]: there was no such Hinduism until British rule.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.240
[Guest]: So they say that there is Christianity, there is Islam, but there is no such, that's not

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.240
[Guest]: true.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.880
[Guest]: It's not true because A, a core part of Hinduism has been, as you mentioned, sacred geography,

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:36.000
[Guest]: the idea of a theersthan, which is the snowy mountains on the top and the oceans below,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.440
[Amit Varma]: you know, and the Indus on one side, and that is there, it is recorded in the Vishnu Purana.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:46.040
[Guest]: But even earlier, when you had Greek and Roman visitors to India, they very clearly had a

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:50.960
[Guest]: sense that on this side of the Indus lies a very particular civilization.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:55.000
[Guest]: So one of the things is that while Indians don't have a group consciousness that we are

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.560
[Guest]: Hindu or we are Indian, any outsider was able to say that this is a distinctive civilization,

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.560
[Guest]: right?

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:04.240
[Guest]: And even the word India comes from the word Indus in that sense.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.920
[Guest]: So I push back against the idea that there is no such Hinduism.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:12.400
[Guest]: But nonetheless, because of these factors of Hinduism, the lack of an authoritative

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:19.080
[Guest]: institution and the lack of a text, what is Hinduism or to put it differently, Hindu group

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:22.080
[Guest]: consciousness has been harder to identify, right?

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:25.600
[Guest]: That you are a Hindu, I am a Hindu, therefore, I should give you a job, right?

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.240
[Unknown]: Because that means answering the question, what is Hinduism to which there are multiple

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:35.240
[Guest]: answers, even though, you know, there is unity in diversity to articulate it by Hindus themselves

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.640
[Unknown]: have been very hard.

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:41.120
[Guest]: The first articulation of that happens by some scholars argue that it's the Vishnu

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.120
[Guest]: Puranas, right?

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:47.600
[Guest]: Around the 4th century AD where you have a recognized architecture of Hinduism with the

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:53.920
[Guest]: sects of Vishnu, Shiva and Devi being the sacred feminine, you know, Jai Mata Di, etc,

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:54.920
[Guest]: etc.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.480
[Guest]: Others say it's really the advent of Muslim group, which, you know, created a Hindu consciousness

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:03.480
[Guest]: and a third group, the more Marxist group says it's British group, right?

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:08.040
[Guest]: But whichever side you buy, I am much more inclined, by the way, to buy the idea that

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:13.240
[Guest]: at least from the Vishnu Puranas, you have an architecture that resembles today's Hinduism,

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.240
[Guest]: right?

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.760
[Guest]: So whichever argument you buy, it's pretty clear that by the late 19th century, you have

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:24.520
[Guest]: the quest for a Hindu identity thinkers like Vivekananda, Bhudev Mukhopadhyay, reform movements

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:30.000
[Guest]: like the Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj are obsessed with the question, what is Hinduism, right?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.040
[Guest]: And I buy the argument that that is in some sense a response to British rule in India.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:42.320
[Guest]: But what this idea of who is a Hindu, what is a Hindu doesn't have is an idea of a state.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:48.480
[Guest]: So if you look at, you know, Bankim Chandra's famous book, which had Vande Mataram in it,

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.680
[Unknown]: he doesn't think of an alternative to British rule.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.440
[Guest]: He is very happy with British rule at the end of it, right?

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.560
[Guest]: So there's no articulation of what a Hindu state looks like.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:01.560
[Guest]: That begins to happen, as I argue, and that leads to the second question that you asked,

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:05.440
[Guest]: only when the British introduced elections, because the moment the British introduced

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:10.480
[Unknown]: elections in India, it's very limited, very halting, begins in the late 19th century,

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:15.240
[Guest]: but really, you know, with the Minto-Modi reforms of 1909, and the Montague-Chancellor

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:20.240
[Guest]: reforms of 1990, it's clear to all Indians that look, one day we will have universal

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:22.800
[Guest]: adult franchise, and one day the British should leave.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.960
[Guest]: So that it's a slippery slope to parliamentary democracy.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:30.160
[Guest]: This creates amid, and this is a core argument, and is the core original argument of this

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:33.440
[Guest]: book, panic among Indians, absolute panic, right?

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:38.200
[Guest]: The Muslim League is created out of the sense of panic, it was largely created by the rich

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:44.920
[Guest]: zamindars of United Provinces, what is today Uttar Pradesh, many of them were Muslim, right?

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:49.200
[Guest]: And they had already seen that limited elections in the late 19th century had reduced their

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:55.320
[Guest]: numbers to something closer to what their numerical strength was, which was 25% in pre-partition

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.320
[Guest]: India.

01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:01.440
[Guest]: And they understood very clearly that once you get into this business of 1% 1 vote, you'll

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.640
[Guest]: end up with the word majority and minority.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.400
[Guest]: Now, in India, the word majority and minority is every child knows the word, even if you

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.400
[Guest]: don't know English.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.840
[Guest]: But we forget that that word exists only in the context of elections, otherwise, why does

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.840
[Guest]: numbers matter?

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:20.600
[Guest]: Elections and 1% 1 vote is the only principle where group size makes a difference in the

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:23.640
[Unknown]: kind of power you use, and today we take it for granted.

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:27.240
[Unknown]: In the early 20th century, it wasn't for granted, those were not the ways in which we thought

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.240
[Guest]: about power.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:33.600
[Guest]: So the Muslim League is created with the specific intent of lobbying the British to reduce democracy

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.400
[Guest]: defined as 1% 1 vote, right?

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:42.120
[Guest]: They want parity between the 75% Hindus in India and the 20-25% Muslims, roughly.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:48.200
[Guest]: They want parity, which would mean, as Savarkar correctly understood, that 3 Hindu votes is

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:54.560
[Guest]: equal to 1 Muslim vote, and they are successful because right in the beginning, when the British

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:58.440
[Guest]: begin to introduce this sort of elections, they have separate electorates for Muslims,

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:02.360
[Guest]: which is only Muslims vote for only Muslim leaders, right?

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:06.760
[Guest]: So the Hindu Mahasabha is created as a response to this, the first national Hindu party.

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:13.280
[Guest]: And their argument is, look, once you begin to do this, the voting power of a Hindu becomes

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.000
[Guest]: much reduced as a Hindu as an individual, which is why, and this is a core argument

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.120
[Guest]: of the book Amit, I argue that Hindu nationalism was very comfortable with elections.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.120
[Unknown]: Why wouldn't they be?

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.640
[Unknown]: Because Hindus are a social majority in India, right?

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:32.680
[Guest]: So when you read or hear about the BJP even today, one of the incongruencies you see is

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.760
[Guest]: this is a party obsessed with creating a social majority, right?

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.960
[Guest]: At the same time, it is politically liberal, at least if you hear their words, right?

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:46.880
[Guest]: So for example, the idea that you should remove Article 370 and Kashmiris and the rest of

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.120
[Unknown]: India must have exactly the same rights is a form of political liberalism that every

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.800
[Guest]: Indian should have the same right.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:57.320
[Guest]: But underpinning that idea is an idea that Hindus are a social majority, right?

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:04.360
[Guest]: That Indian Hindus have about 100 times as much voting power as the Muslim Kashmiri Indians,

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.360
[Guest]: right?

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:09.840
[Guest]: And therefore equalization will help empower a Hindu social majority.

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:14.920
[Guest]: And the game, Amit, and I argue that that's also the game behind the creation of the RSS

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.640
[Guest]: is to make sure enough Hindus vote as one.

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:23.240
[Guest]: The 100-year project of the RSS, the Hindu Mahasabha, the Jansan, is to create a Hindu

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.240
[Guest]: vote bank.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:30.000
[Guest]: And Narendra Modi is the apotheosis of that 100-year idea, which is created through elections.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
[Unknown]: Why does this idea matter even today?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.040
[Unknown]: The idea matters even today because too many critics of BJP, you know, say, oh, they're

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.040
[Unknown]: fascists.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.400
[Guest]: And think about non-democratic means to get rid of them.

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:43.360
[Guest]: The only way to defeat Narendra Modi is on election day.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.000
[Guest]: There's no other way to defeat him.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
[Guest]: They are not fascists.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.720
[Guest]: They are obsessed with elections.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.720
[Guest]: They are constituted with elections.

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:54.040
[Guest]: In fact, a BJP leader offline, I'll tell you the person to add more credibility, unfortunately,

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.280
[Guest]: I can't tell you online, but let me put it this way.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:02.160
[Guest]: Imagine the most important BJP leader who you think will say this is likely to be that

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.160
[Guest]: person.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.880
[Guest]: Told me that, you know, I win elections in order to worship God, right?

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.560
[Guest]: So you worship God through winning elections.

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:14.440
[Guest]: And I, you know, the argument here is not that the BJP is a religious force in that

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.440
[Guest]: sense.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.040
[Guest]: It's based on social identity, but that obsession with elections, like just now, Amit, while

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:25.520
[Guest]: we are recording this, the Hyderabad municipal elections are going on, municipal elections.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:31.120
[Guest]: And you had Narendra Modi going there ostensibly to see some vaccine, but really to campaign

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.120
[Unknown]: for it.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.120
[Guest]: Amit Shah has gone, Yogi Adityanath has gone.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:38.920
[Guest]: And at the very same time, Rahul Gandhi and his mother are holidaying in Goa.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.600
[Guest]: And I think his sister is holidaying in Himachal Pradesh.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:45.280
[Guest]: I may be wrong on the facts a little bit, but roughly.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.680
[Guest]: Why does the BJP do that?

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.760
[Guest]: Because elections constitutes that, but that's, I'm not giving them a free pass by saying

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:51.760
[Guest]: that.

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:56.520
[Guest]: I'm just saying that, what do you think will happen if in a group based society where Indians,

01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:01.760
[Guest]: every part of an Indian life is based on groups, you suddenly introduce a principle of one

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.040
[Guest]: person, one vote.

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.640
[Guest]: It's not that overnight Indians are going to become like Swiss citizens who vote on

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.640
[Guest]: the basis of interest.

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:12.200
[Guest]: Instead, the game is who is a Hindu, how do we redefine that, right?

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:16.680
[Guest]: And it's not just Hindu nationalists who are doing this, you have the creation of a Dravidian

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:20.240
[Unknown]: identity in Tamil Nadu, which is a majority identity, right?

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.760
[Unknown]: Kashi Ram understands that you can create an anti upper caste identity, which is the

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.840
[Guest]: Bahujan identity, which is about 80% of India.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:35.840
[Guest]: So democracy in a group based society incentivizes politicians to constantly expand group size

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.560
[Guest]: to conjure up majorities so that they can win elections, right?

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:44.880
[Guest]: And in that sense, the BJP is a natural product of what you get when you introduce elections

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.880
[Guest]: in India.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:46.880
[Amit Varma]: No, that's fascinating.

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.600
[Amit Varma]: And I'm going to sort of try to unpack that layer by layer.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:54.000
[Amit Varma]: But first of all, you just gave us two examples of sentences that do two things that both

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.560
[Amit Varma]: tell and show, you know, when Narendra Modi going to a municipal election or Rahul Gandhi

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:04.440
[Amit Varma]: holidaying in Goa, both tell you a mundane fact, but also show you something, something

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:05.440
[Amit Varma]: larger within that.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:10.000
[Guest]: But if I was writing this Amit, just to tell your listeners who are into writing, I would

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.160
[Amit Varma]: edit the gyaan, I would just tell you these facts, you know, and put it in a way, and

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.160
[Amit Varma]: the facts would speak for themselves, put it in a way in which the facts speak for them.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:21.920
[Amit Varma]: But that happens only in draft number nine or 10.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:25.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, you're intimidating everyone with all this talk of draft number nine or 10,

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:30.680
[Amit Varma]: or I'll get it right in draft 18 and all of that, to sort of go back to this narrative.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, another interesting thing that strikes me, and this is again, sort of how

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:40.360
[Amit Varma]: circumstances can shape history that, you know, in 1906, you have this talk of elections,

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:44.960
[Amit Varma]: and therefore, as a, you know, to protect their standing within the elites, a Muslim

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.960
[Amit Varma]: League is formed.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:51.080
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, in 1909, you have the Minto-Modli reforms, and, you know, suddenly Hindus realized

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.000
[Amit Varma]: three votes are going to be equal to one.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.160
[Amit Varma]: And then you have various other things happening as a response to that, including the Hindu

01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:01.960
[Amit Varma]: Massacre in 1915, with Lala Lajpatra and Mother Mohan Malviya, because, and they're a pressure

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:04.160
[Amit Varma]: group within the Congress to begin with.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:07.640
[Amit Varma]: And then a number of interesting things happen, as you point out in the book, and you know,

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:10.440
[Amit Varma]: I've spoken about on previous episodes and all of that.

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:15.880
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, it's one is a whole Khilafat movement, which really makes no cohesive sense,

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:21.720
[Amit Varma]: because, you know, one party to that, you know, the Ali brothers and all that are agitating

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:26.920
[Amit Varma]: for this larger Muslim Ummah and the other party Mahatma Gandhi is talking about an Indian

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:29.520
[Amit Varma]: state and the two don't sort of go together.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:33.880
[Amit Varma]: And many people view that as appeasement or selling out or, you know, what the hell is

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.220
[Amit Varma]: the Congress doing?

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:38.840
[Amit Varma]: And eventually that drives the Mahasabha away from the Congress as well.

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:43.080
[Amit Varma]: And in the 20s, because of what is happening, because of this, what you call the demographic

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:48.100
[Amit Varma]: anxiety, you also have the different strands of Hindutva come together.

01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:52.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, there is Savarkar and one could argue that, you know, if you look at Savarkar

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:57.920
[Amit Varma]: pre-imprisonment, he's actually always, he's never saying anything anti-Muslim, but then

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:03.400
[Amit Varma]: he's radicalized in his time in prison by the torture that he receives at the hands

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:08.960
[Amit Varma]: of Muslims who are sort of, you know, the Pathans and so on, who are, you know, carrying

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:13.000
[Amit Varma]: out the torture on the commands of the British and that kind of radicalizes him.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.120
[Amit Varma]: So that's another interesting circumstance.

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.040
[Amit Varma]: But the two interesting things that happened in the 20s, obviously, is, you know, Savarkar

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:23.560
[Amit Varma]: writing Hindutva and then the formation of the RSS.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:28.720
[Amit Varma]: And because both of them are sort of political and both of them, as you point out, are a

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:33.920
[Amit Varma]: response in part to this demographic anxiety, you know, both of them, therefore, tend to

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:34.920
[Amit Varma]: be inclusive.

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:38.000
[Amit Varma]: How do you build the largest political movement that you can?

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.200
[Amit Varma]: You bring everybody under one umbrella and you, you know, Savarkar, of course, besides

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:49.360
[Amit Varma]: being an atheist and a lover of beef was also a sort of, you know, against caste.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:54.920
[Amit Varma]: And the RSS, you point out, was actually when you look at Hindu organizations, the RSS was

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:58.200
[Amit Varma]: fairly radical because they didn't care about caste either.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.120
[Amit Varma]: They just wanted to bring everybody under the Hindu umbrella.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:03.040
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about this.

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:10.160
[Amit Varma]: And why does this, you know, impression persist among the elites today that the BJP is a casteist

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:14.400
[Amit Varma]: party when clearly, as you know, Prashant Jha wrote in How the BJP Wins, he quoted a

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.480
[Amit Varma]: Dalit scholar as saying that they are the Dalit party of India.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.240
[Amit Varma]: They get more Dalit votes than everybody else.

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:22.440
[Amit Varma]: So you know, why does that impression persist?

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:27.800
[Amit Varma]: And tell me then a little bit about, you know, how the sort of the evolution of this sort

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.800
[Guest]: of thinking.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:32.960
[Guest]: So, I mean, that's a good question, but that has a complex answer, right, which is the

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:37.960
[Guest]: question you're asking is that the relationship between Hindu nationalism and caste, and that's

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:40.000
[Guest]: a complex set of answers.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.160
[Guest]: I think that the headline news for me, you know, which is something you just said, which

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:49.280
[Guest]: is that given that traditional Hinduism is so hierarchical, Hindu nationalism is the

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:54.720
[Guest]: most progressive element of traditional Hinduism when it comes to caste, right?

01:23:54.720 --> 01:24:00.440
[Guest]: On the other hand, traditional Hinduism was very accommodating of multiple sects, multiple

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:05.560
[Guest]: religious practices, you know, the apocryphal stories of when Arab Muslim traders landed

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:10.080
[Guest]: in Kerala, local Muslims only helped build the mosque, right?

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:14.200
[Guest]: On the other hand, Hindu nationalism is much more exclusive and regressive when it comes

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.200
[Guest]: to religion.

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:19.840
[Guest]: So this is the, many of the critics of the BJP just don't understand this, that if it

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:24.120
[Guest]: was just in upper caste body, it would get 20% of the vote, you can't win.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:30.560
[Guest]: So it is this mix of being a progressive force for Hindus, or let's say the most progressive

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:35.640
[Guest]: force for Hindus, let me qualify that, while being an out and out exclusive force for Muslims,

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:39.720
[Guest]: specifically also Christians, also Muslims, that's what gives it this edge.

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:43.560
[Guest]: And of course, the core argument of the book is that edge is defined by democracy.

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:48.480
[Guest]: That once you introduce elections as an incentive to create majority, so as Hindus are post

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:53.480
[Unknown]: independence about, you know, 80% of India, you just have to unite half of them and part

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:58.280
[Unknown]: of uniting half of them is to pick on another, but half of them is also to organize meals

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.560
[Guest]: between Brahmins and Dalits, right?

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:07.120
[Guest]: So for example, the critics today are right in criticizing the BJP for these anti-love

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:12.440
[Guest]: jihad laws, right? and because there's no empirical evidence that this is true at all.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.440
[Guest]: And I agree with that.

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:18.800
[Guest]: But what they omit is that the VHP has spent a lot of time financially encouraging inter-caste

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:19.800
[Guest]: marriages.

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:25.320
[Guest]: So in a local village, you know, boy and girl of a different community try to marry, sometimes

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:30.240
[Guest]: the local VHP person you have to go to, to protect yourself against the against the parents.

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:33.160
[Guest]: And if you don't see this, then you're living in fool's paradise.

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:37.240
[Unknown]: And I think many of the critics of the BJP, you know, they get very comfortable saying

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:40.800
[Unknown]: over their fascist, which means you don't have to mobilize against them on the ground.

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:44.600
[Unknown]: You don't have to actually convince your fellow citizens that look, vote for somebody else.

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:50.480
[Guest]: Instead, you can write op-eds in like fancy newspapers and foreign, it may help your career,

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.000
[Unknown]: but it doesn't change BJP at all.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.520
[Guest]: But you know, the deeper question you asked Amit, the relationship between caste and Hindu

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.360
[Guest]: nationalism is complex.

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:06.280
[Guest]: The RSS is created not just as an upper caste organization, but as an organization created

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:12.480
[Guest]: by a few families from one specific or a couple of specific communities within Maharashtra

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:15.480
[Guest]: Brahmins, the Karade and the Desha Brahmins communities.

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:21.880
[Guest]: And I think that every single Sarsanchalak or head of the RSS, except one, has been a

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:22.880
[Unknown]: Marathi speaking Brahmin.

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:23.880
[Unknown]: Right.

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:28.680
[Unknown]: So that tells you that the critics are not wrong in saying that the BJP originally is

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:33.720
[Unknown]: and even today, if you look at the data, the heart of the BJP is still upper caste consolidation.

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.720
[Guest]: So I don't want to go away from that.

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:40.720
[Guest]: But if you wear a mask for a hundred years, Amit, that mask looks like your face and you

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:45.640
[Guest]: know, that the outreach that they've been doing, even in the 1930s itself, back then

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:51.360
[Unknown]: itself, Bhotse as an RSS member was part of the anti-caste or temple entry movement there.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:55.480
[Guest]: Now you can say that today's Dalits find that patronizing, right, saying that what do you

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.480
[Unknown]: feel about reservations?

01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:01.040
[Unknown]: Well, when Mandal Commission is announced on August 1990, I have a whole chapter on

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.040
[Guest]: that.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:06.680
[Guest]: Advani is under a lot of pressure from his upper caste base to oppose Mandal Commission

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.680
[Guest]: recommendations.

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.120
[Guest]: But actually he supports them.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.680
[Guest]: He asked for an extension of quota for the upper caste poor, which is what Narendra

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.480
[Guest]: Modi has literally done now.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:19.400
[Unknown]: But otherwise he supports the Mandal Commission and had he not done that, had he opposed it,

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.240
[Unknown]: the BJP would have remained an upper caste party.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:23.880
[Unknown]: He went against the core base, right?

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:28.360
[Guest]: Today, as prime minister, Narendra Modi has done as much for reservations, right?

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:32.760
[Guest]: As any prime minister that India has had, maybe Baahubali Singh, again, that's not a

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.160
[Guest]: coincidence, right?

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:38.360
[Guest]: So if you don't like the BJP, at least understand your enemy, right?

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:44.520
[Guest]: And understand why is it that a tea seller's son from an oil pressing OBC caste in Gujarat,

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:45.520
[Guest]: right?

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:51.560
[Guest]: Who doesn't have a strong family background, joins the RSS, not just for social mobility,

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:55.080
[Guest]: but for a sense of brotherhood and fellow feeling, I'm referring, of course, to Narendra

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.080
[Guest]: Modi.

01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:01.120
[Guest]: If you don't understand this part, which goes along, what is an advertised rebuff to Muslims

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:06.200
[Guest]: right from the beginning of the RSS, it's very hard to defeat it, you know?

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:11.640
[Guest]: And this, you know, the idea, as you know, Amit, and as many of your listeners know,

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:17.360
[Guest]: many Indian Muslim communities have practices that are on the ground are Hindu.

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:24.240
[Guest]: And they operate on the many of these communities, Bhoras, Pujas, etc, etc, Jinnah's own community,

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:29.360
[Guest]: you know, they live their lives on the border of, you know, Islam and Hinduism.

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:34.600
[Guest]: The RSS doesn't like that, because just like they want to dilute the boundaries within

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:39.000
[Guest]: Hinduism, they want to erect strong barriers between Hindu and outside, because if you

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.600
[Guest]: don't do that, you can't answer the question, who is a Hindu or what is Hinduism?

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.440
[Guest]: And if you don't have a clear answer to that question, how are you going to get all these

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.320
[Guest]: people to vote as one?

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:52.320
[Guest]: So right at the beginning, I have a story in the book that Hegdevar notices that there's

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:57.040
[Guest]: a Muslim Sufi shrine near Nagpur, which are also attracting Hindu devotees.

01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:01.360
[Guest]: He doesn't like that, you know, he pushes, and my job, as you noticed in the book is

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.480
[Guest]: not to support the BJP or to oppose it.

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.160
[Guest]: And I hope I have succeeded in that.

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.160
[Guest]: That's not my game here.

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:08.160
[Guest]: But I have to say the truth, right?

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.240
[Guest]: And the truth is that from the beginning, it has been suspicious of Muslims.

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:15.560
[Guest]: And from the beginning, it has tried to reach out to lower caste Hindus.

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:19.520
[Amit Varma]: No, and you know, the most fascinating phrase from this conversation so far is what you

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:24.280
[Amit Varma]: just said about if you wear a mask for 100 years, it becomes a face, which leads me to

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:29.240
[Amit Varma]: the sort of the meta musing that is there anything called a face or, you know, is it

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.840
[Amit Varma]: all just a succession of masks?

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:32.840
[Amit Varma]: But leave that aside.

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:36.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know, the other thing I'd also sort of like to point out to my listeners

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:41.000
[Amit Varma]: as well reading this book, I had a sense that this is a very fascinating companion book

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.800
[Amit Varma]: to Akshay Mukul's book on the Gita Press, because that is about the social and cultural

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:51.440
[Amit Varma]: movement of Hindu nationalism, while yours focuses on the political side of it.

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:54.480
[Amit Varma]: And for me, the two sort of come together very well.

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:59.680
[Guest]: Can I give you just a little bit of a counter because, you know, I've read the book, I cite

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:04.000
[Guest]: the book, I love Akshay Mukul and he's also been on your podcast, right?

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.760
[Guest]: But just to push back just a little bit, see his evidence for is that, you know, the Gita

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:14.840
[Unknown]: Press is I think he looks at Kalyan, which is the magazine of Gita Press, and definitely

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:17.560
[Guest]: many of the views there are regressive, right?

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:20.880
[Guest]: My only pushback is that's not Hindu nationalism, right?

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:25.680
[Guest]: So really, if you want to look at where what political Hinduism is doing, look at the RSS

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.680
[Guest]: mouthpiece organizer, right?

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:30.000
[Guest]: Look at some of the BJP magazines, right?

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.600
[Guest]: And that's the point that I'm pushing that when it comes to caste issues, especially

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:40.360
[Guest]: your even gender, but mainly caste, the Hindu nationalism or the institutions of Hindu nationalism,

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:46.760
[Guest]: like the RSS or the BJP or the Jansan are far more progressive than the Gita Press is.

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:51.880
[Guest]: The Gita Press is really the organ of traditional Hinduism, right?

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:56.840
[Guest]: And so that's one, you know, debate, I would say me and Akshay Mukul have that, look, he's

01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:57.840
[Unknown]: right, right?

01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:02.720
[Unknown]: But in many ways, the RSS and BJP want to go away from the stuff that is appearing in

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:08.440
[Guest]: Kalyan, because if Hindu nationalism becomes the description that Akshay Mukul has from

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:12.520
[Guest]: the Gita Press, how on earth is it going to get votes, you know?

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:14.960
[Amit Varma]: No, no, that's absolutely a fair point.

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.680
[Amit Varma]: And the picture is vast and complex.

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:20.280
[Amit Varma]: So you know, the elephant will have a leg, the elephant will have a tail, the elephant

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:21.600
[Amit Varma]: will have a trunk.

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:26.760
[Amit Varma]: Tell me now a little bit about many people today speak of Hindu nationalism as if it

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:27.760
[Amit Varma]: is one thing.

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:32.320
[Amit Varma]: But of course, see, you know, the RSS is going in one direction, Savarkar is going in another

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.320
[Amit Varma]: direction.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:37.880
[Amit Varma]: In fact, there are clashes between them, because Savarkar, of course, is political in 1942.

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:42.680
[Amit Varma]: He wants the RSS foot soldiers to help him in the elections and the RSS just says no

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:43.680
[Amit Varma]: and get lost.

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:47.560
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, that is at the point where, you know, shortly after that, Nathuram Godse starts

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:51.880
[Amit Varma]: his magazine, where he rails against two things, Mahatma Gandhi and the RSS.

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:52.880
[Guest]: Agrani, Agrani.

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:53.880
[Amit Varma]: Agrani.

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:59.160
[Amit Varma]: So, so tell me a little bit about this sort of very interesting relationship between the

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:02.160
[Amit Varma]: RSS and Savarkar and how they view each other.

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:05.800
[Amit Varma]: And of course, the Hindu Mahasabha as well, which is very prominent then, but doesn't

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:09.680
[Amit Varma]: seem so much now in hindsight, but because it's almost disappeared.

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:13.880
[Amit Varma]: But at the time, that was like another prominent sort of force.

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:16.720
[Guest]: Yeah, it was the first national Hindu party.

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:17.720
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:23.440
[Guest]: I mean, the larger question that you're asking is that, you know, Hindu nationalism, as you

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.440
[Guest]: said, you know, speaks in many voices, right?

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:30.680
[Guest]: Then how is, but it's nonetheless, I mean, I can't emphasize this organizationally united,

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:36.200
[Guest]: but the Hindu nationalism today is basically comes out of an organizational constellation

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:38.280
[Unknown]: with the RSS as the sun.

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:42.440
[Guest]: There's no two ways about it, you know, and you have plenty of quote-unquote Hindu organizations

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:46.640
[Guest]: like the Karni Seva, which I would not call Hindu nationalist in that sense, because it

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:48.400
[Unknown]: doesn't arise out of the RSS.

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:52.200
[Guest]: You may have some similarities and thoughts, this, that, but they are not, right?

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:56.960
[Guest]: Or no shortage of Akhadas, you know, who have like similar views to like the BJP, but they

01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:01.080
[Guest]: are, they don't report to Modi and there's no way Modi can reach out to them.

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:06.760
[Guest]: So Hindu nationalism organizationally is actually quite clear, what is, if you tell me the organization,

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:07.760
[Unknown]: I'll tell you.

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:08.760
[Guest]: Is it Hindu?

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:10.560
[Guest]: Like Hindu Mahasabha today is outside the paper.

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:15.800
[Guest]: Hindu Mahasabha, for example, you know, they celebrate Godse's statues, the RSS is furious

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:19.240
[Unknown]: with that, but you can't say anything because the Hindu Mahasabha today has nothing to do

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:20.240
[Guest]: with the RSS.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:24.480
[Guest]: Yet, as you pointed out, they speak in different voices and look, this is really the heart

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:28.560
[Unknown]: of the book, which is, that's why the title Jugalbandi, which is that the power of Hindu

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:34.120
[Guest]: nationalism is that just like in a Jugalbandi, you have people playing different instruments,

01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.120
[Guest]: different music.

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:39.600
[Guest]: Nonetheless, you're able to make music together and RSS celebrates that.

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:44.040
[Amit Varma]: So for example, right now, just to give you one more example, before we go to the Savarkar

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:49.160
[Guest]: Bolvalkar question then, but something to sort of link your listeners to today, many

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:54.880
[Amit Varma]: of the labor reforms that the Narendra Modi government has made, right, is opposed by

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.880
[Guest]: the RSS trade union.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.880
[Guest]: How do you make sense of it?

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:57.880
[Guest]: Right?

01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:58.880
[Unknown]: They opposed it.

01:33:58.880 --> 01:33:59.880
[Unknown]: How do you make sense of it?

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:00.880
[Guest]: Both are part of the RSS, right?

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:06.880
[Guest]: Narendra Modi is an ex-pracharak, BJP is very much part of the RSS family, right?

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:12.080
[Unknown]: But you have to, and the answer is that the RSS has always seen this like an Indian family.

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:15.600
[Unknown]: In Indian family, the, you know, legendarily the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law don't

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:16.600
[Unknown]: get along.

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:17.600
[Unknown]: Brothers may be fighting, right?

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:21.720
[Guest]: The father and the daughter may be having some issues, but nonetheless, at the end of

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:22.720
[Guest]: the day, you stay united.

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:27.800
[Guest]: And again, you know, we can discuss in detail, the heart of this book's argument is that

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:31.720
[Unknown]: the reason the BJP wins, there are many reasons, but I would say the cutting edge reason is

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:35.280
[Guest]: that even when they disagree, they don't split, right?

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:39.200
[Guest]: And the reason they do that is from a very early age, they're taught a certain version

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.440
[Guest]: of Hindu history, where you have these different battles where Hindus lose on the battlefield

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:47.920
[Guest]: because at key moments, they stab each other in the back, right?

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:48.920
[Guest]: This is the key.

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:51.440
[Guest]: And so that becomes an organizational ethic for today.

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:56.320
[Unknown]: Now coming back to the question that you asked on Savarkar and Golwalkar, you know, people

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:59.400
[Guest]: whisper about it, but I think I'm one of the first people to point out that they didn't

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:00.400
[Guest]: like each other.

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:04.720
[Unknown]: They didn't like each other, one for the reason you mentioned, which is that Golwalkar wanted

01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:06.600
[Guest]: nothing to do with politics, right?

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:11.160
[Guest]: Because he was more focused on the social aspect of Hindu nationalism, which is creating

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:13.520
[Guest]: a common Hindu social identity.

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:18.000
[Guest]: But as I pointed out, that itself is spurred by elections, otherwise, why do you care whether

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.600
[Guest]: 40% of Hindus think alike, except you want to make them into a whole pack, right?

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:26.160
[Unknown]: This is Savarkar who straight up wanted to contest elections.

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:30.560
[Unknown]: He became the head of the Hindu Mahasabha, he wanted to win elections and he kept losing.

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:35.440
[Guest]: And he kept losing because the Hindus of that period voted for the better Hindu leader,

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:38.160
[Guest]: better I mean electorally, Mahatma Gandhi, right?

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:42.800
[Unknown]: And that was Savarkar's huge anger, he hated Gandhi not because they were different, but

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:46.280
[Guest]: actually they were pretty similar in that they were appealing to, right?

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:51.160
[Guest]: It's just that Gandhi was able to get the Hindu vote by not being anti-Muslim.

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.600
[Unknown]: So that was Savarkar's game, right?

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:57.120
[Unknown]: And but what so that was definitely one reason for the difference.

01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:00.880
[Guest]: But another bigger reason is that they were very different personalities.

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:07.400
[Guest]: Now this obsession with unity that the RSS has, with teamwork over all else means that

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:11.720
[Guest]: these kind of brilliant geniuses, you know, who are prima donnas don't have a place in

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:12.720
[Guest]: it.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:18.320
[Amit Varma]: And I hope that it is descriptively accurate to say that the RSS doesn't have too many

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:19.320
[Guest]: smart people in it.

01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:23.720
[Guest]: And I mean it in a very descriptive sense, because you know, think about any organization

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:29.080
[Guest]: Amit that you've worked in, you'd always have these brilliant jerks, I'm sure in Crick

01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:33.000
[Guest]: Info you also found these guys, they're very good, you know, they're very bright, but it's

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.560
[Guest]: impossible to work with them in an organization.

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:40.120
[Guest]: The RSS is obsessed about weeding these people out, you know, so people like Subramanian

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:45.280
[Guest]: Swami, M.L.Sondhi, who was a Rhodes Scholar, Balraj Madhok, who I spent a lot of time with,

01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:50.160
[Unknown]: very bright, much brighter than the average RSS pacharak, you know, a genuine thinker,

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:54.000
[Guest]: right, but just will not subordinate the self to the organization.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.680
[Guest]: In contrast, someone like Atal Bihari Vajpayee, also very bright, but not an intellectual,

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:04.080
[Unknown]: knew that when what he wanted the RSS was unwilling to do, he would, as I say in the

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:07.640
[Guest]: book, sulk on mute, but he wouldn't leave the party.

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:11.440
[Unknown]: And I think Savarkar was a little different, he was a bit of a prima donna.

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:16.800
[Guest]: So even today, when I talk to people in the RSS, I mean, Amit Shah has his photograph,

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:20.360
[Guest]: you know, in his drawing room, Advani has his photograph in the drawing room.

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:24.520
[Guest]: But they also see him as a little bit of a warning that, you know, if you want to succeed

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:30.160
[Guest]: in India, you, you know, you may have Savarkar's grand ideas, but you can't behave like him,

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:31.160
[Amit Varma]: you know.

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:36.760
[Amit Varma]: No, and that's like one of the sort of fascinating stances, this whole RSS is organizational

01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:41.320
[Amit Varma]: ethic, where you never speak out against your own organization or against your colleagues

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.320
[Guest]: in public.

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.320
[Guest]: Externally.

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.320
[Unknown]: Exactly.

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.320
[Unknown]: In public, that's what I said.

01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:48.440
[Guest]: I'm able to show you plenty of situations where internally, there's a far more robust

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:53.160
[Unknown]: debate happening, at least in the period that I'm writing about that happens in the Congress.

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:57.080
[Unknown]: The Congress, they talk about democracy, democracy, there's zero internal democracy, right?

01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:01.360
[Guest]: Whereas, you know, I point out that when Vajpayee government was in power, there was no shortage

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:06.720
[Guest]: of his own cabinet ministers like Murali Manohar Joshi, Ram Nayak from his own party, who opposed

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:09.600
[Guest]: his policies and spoke up in cabinet, you know.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:13.800
[Amit Varma]: I ended my last sentence by saying in public, you did not wait for that.

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:17.760
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, I completely agree with you that the Congress is the opposite ethos, it might

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:21.560
[Amit Varma]: seem there is no dissent, but that is because it is not allowed, there is no internal dissent

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:22.560
[Amit Varma]: either.

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.960
[Amit Varma]: And that's a whole sort of different story.

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.360
[Amit Varma]: And the examples you pointed out that the people who spoke out like Balraj Madhok and

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:31.760
[Amit Varma]: Subramanian Swamy in the 70s, basically left the party.

01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:37.800
[Amit Varma]: So Vajpayee knew that even if he disagrees, he's got to hold his peace and sort of bide

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:38.800
[Amit Varma]: his time.

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:45.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, tell me a little bit about how this ethos comes from their reading of history, specifically

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:51.680
[Amit Varma]: you point in your book to the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, as having a profound lesson

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:54.800
[Amit Varma]: for the whole Hindu nationalist movement.

01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:01.480
[Amit Varma]: And this sort of this particular organizational ethic that you stick together as a team, no

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.600
[Amit Varma]: matter how much you disagree in private also comes directly from there.

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.960
[Guest]: Tell me a little bit about the importance of that.

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:10.840
[Guest]: Well, so let me tell you, let me tell you the research answer, which is how I got to

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:11.840
[Guest]: the answer.

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:12.840
[Guest]: Right?

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:14.760
[Guest]: Because rather than just tell you the answer how I got there.

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:18.040
[Guest]: So I've been, you know, I interviewed about 200 people for this book, many of them from

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:19.040
[Guest]: the RSS, BJP.

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:24.360
[Guest]: And I was, I mean, I was, I was struck by how they kept referring to history.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:26.840
[Guest]: Of course, it was their version of history.

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:30.800
[Guest]: So, you know, at my university, if I asked a historian, you know, they will say, where's

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:31.800
[Guest]: the footnote?

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:32.800
[Guest]: That's not the point.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:38.080
[Guest]: In fact, many of them like, not just, they write historical fiction, for example, K.M.

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:39.080
[Guest]: Munshi.

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:44.600
[Guest]: Amit Shah's, you know, one of his favorite books is K.M. Munshi's trilogy on the last

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:47.160
[Guest]: Hindu king of Gujarat, Sidhrath Jai Singh.

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.160
[Guest]: It's not a historical book.

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:53.320
[Guest]: It's like, you know, will you call Amish Tripathi, who I like a lot, his writing, he's not a

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.320
[Guest]: historian, right?

01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:58.640
[Guest]: You can say at the most is historical fiction, but that forms the basis for, you know, what

01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.680
[Unknown]: the RSS reads and understands about India.

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.720
[Guest]: And so I had, you know, this was, I was in Chandrapur, right, this is about a couple

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:06.720
[Guest]: of years back.

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:09.320
[Unknown]: That's about an hour, about a few hours away from Nagpur.

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:14.240
[Unknown]: And I just visited the family home of Mohan Bhagwat, who is the head of the RSS.

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:19.560
[Guest]: And I spoke to his brother, Ravindra, who is the only person in the family who has given

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.560
[Unknown]: me permission to quote, right.

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:25.360
[Guest]: And, you know, he spoke a lot about Shakha and, you know, he's a very low key lawyer.

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:29.800
[Guest]: By the way, another sign that, you know, if you go and meet like the brother or a sister

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:34.320
[Guest]: of a top congressman, they'd be living in style, you know, but the, you know, the brother

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.640
[Guest]: of the, you know, the, what many people think is the man who really runs India is living

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:41.920
[Guest]: in a low key style and low key house and going to a trial court.

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:43.920
[Unknown]: It's a very different ethic.

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:49.040
[Guest]: So the one thing is that I have to prevent myself, and this is an aside, I mean, of not

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:54.480
[Guest]: becoming too admiring of the RSS, because many of the views which I disagree with, was

01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:59.400
[Unknown]: at odds with their personal austerity, you know, which I, it's very hard not to admire.

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:04.080
[Unknown]: And then I meet people in the Congress who in many instances, I may even agree with,

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:08.320
[Guest]: but then I see all of them that, you know, they may be wearing these like kurta pajamas,

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.600
[Guest]: but they have like a 30,000 rupee pen, right.

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:14.000
[Unknown]: And I'm like, you know, like, what kind of hypocrisy is this?

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.840
[Unknown]: I think most Indians, you know, that's the flavor of the Congress that irritates them,

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.840
[Guest]: right.

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:24.800
[Unknown]: It's a massive hypocrisy between the frugal talk and the actual flashy lifestyle, right?

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:25.800
[Unknown]: The RSS is the reverse.

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:28.800
[Unknown]: So anyway, we have spoken a lot about the shakhas.

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:33.320
[Guest]: Now, for those of you listeners who don't know it, the shakha is the principal unit

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.320
[Guest]: of the RSS.

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:39.920
[Guest]: You go for about an hour to an open ground and with about 20-30 people, you perform group

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:44.160
[Guest]: exercises for half the time and for half the time, you have an intellectual conversation

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:50.400
[Guest]: or somebody talks that kind of thing and he was talking about the shakha and then I did

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:55.200
[Guest]: something that I think academics should do, which is that instead of actually going to

01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:00.360
[Guest]: a shakha at that time, I went on YouTube and saw a lot of shakha videos, you know, which

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:03.200
[Guest]: I shouldn't, you know, I should have gone to shakha, you know, but I was like obsessed

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.200
[Guest]: that, you know, why not?

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:08.440
[Guest]: Easy, because all these amateur videos put up by RSS guys on shakha and, you know, my

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:14.240
[Guest]: Western training, Amit had taught me to see these shakhas, you know, the marching as a

01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:18.360
[Guest]: sign of martial valor, because part of the Western theory of the RSS is that, you know,

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:22.840
[Guest]: Hindus have a psychological feeling that they're puny compared to the more martial Muslim.

01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:25.320
[Guest]: So you know, this is a way to man up Hindus, right?

01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:30.480
[Guest]: There is some truth to it, but I saw it and I realized that it was more than just, you

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:31.480
[Guest]: know, marching.

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:32.480
[Guest]: It was actually synchronization.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:33.480
[Guest]: It was teamwork.

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:38.200
[Guest]: And Amit, I'm sure that in the corporate organization that you have worked, you go for these corporate

01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:39.200
[Guest]: retreats sometimes, right?

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:43.480
[Guest]: And you play, and I know it's a bit boring, but I think you play these games, right?

01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:44.480
[Guest]: To build team building.

01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:45.480
[Guest]: That's what an RSS shakha is.

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:53.000
[Guest]: And in a flash, I understood, Amit, that the reading of history actually becomes an organizational

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:58.160
[Guest]: form that the purpose of the shakha is to tell young Hindus, this is how you work in

01:42:58.160 --> 01:42:59.160
[Guest]: a team.

01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:00.160
[Guest]: This is how you coordinate.

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:04.000
[Guest]: This is how you stand on each other's shoulder and break the dahi handi, right?

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.040
[Guest]: So there is a martial element, but the core element is teamwork, right?

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:12.400
[Guest]: And look, nothing I had read prepared me to understand this, but once I saw it, it was

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.400
[Guest]: there all over the place.

01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:17.360
[Guest]: You know, it's one of those hidden in plain sight that the history lesson, and you know,

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:19.280
[Guest]: frankly, the RSS is obsessed about it.

01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:24.680
[Guest]: So one history lesson that you mentioned was the third battle of Panipat, which was fought

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:27.680
[Guest]: between Ahmed Shah Abdali from Afghanistan and the Marathas.

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:32.600
[Guest]: Now this is particularly important because in the 18th century in India was the Maratha

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:33.600
[Guest]: century.

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:39.320
[Guest]: As many of your listeners will know, the Marathas controlled from Tanjore all the way to Delhi,

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:40.320
[Guest]: right?

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:46.360
[Guest]: They had it under the, this is the Peshwa, the Maratha empire that sort of succeeds Shivaji.

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:50.600
[Guest]: And the British is a presence in India, but it's a minor presence.

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:55.840
[Guest]: And the RSS believes that had the Marathas not lost in the third battle of Panipat, because

01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:56.840
[Unknown]: they got annihilated.

01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:02.120
[Unknown]: And that, and not just they got annihilated, even Ahmed Shah Abdali was so badly bruised,

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.560
[Unknown]: he has to leave India.

01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:08.200
[Unknown]: And so the RSS version is that this created a power vacuum in India, that you neither

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:12.360
[Guest]: had Ahmed Shah Abdali, nor did you have the Marathas, into this power vacuum crept the

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:13.360
[Guest]: British.

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:18.800
[Unknown]: Not just my view, in the 2019 elections, literally what Amit Shah said, and again, if anyone's

01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:22.920
[Guest]: paying attention, they should have said, why is this man, whose popular impression is that

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:25.920
[Guest]: look, he doesn't leave, he's not a cultivated man in that sense.

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:31.280
[Guest]: He's actually referring to very precise historical examples, when he's talking about defeating

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:33.760
[Guest]: the Congress in 2019.

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:38.600
[Guest]: And immediately those two things struck me, I would say it's the inside of the book, which

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:44.840
[Guest]: is that the reading of history has created a ethos, where whatever they do, they don't

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:47.560
[Guest]: split, because their view is that Indians always split.

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:52.520
[Guest]: And they're not wrong in that, that anyone who works in India realizes that we are lousy

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:54.720
[Guest]: team players, lousy.

01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:59.040
[Guest]: You have like, I'm sure in your time in Cricinfo or wherever else you work, there would have

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:03.560
[Guest]: been five, six different factions, people who are like, have lunch together, other people

01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:04.560
[Guest]: have lunch.

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:10.240
[Guest]: In meetings, they will say yes, yes, but then behind your back, they'll say no, no.

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:14.040
[Guest]: Everyone who's listening to this podcast will sympathize with this problem, that you deal

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:16.680
[Guest]: with Indian groups, you deal with factions.

01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:21.560
[Guest]: The RSS has understood it, and they spend all their time trying to solve this problem.

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:23.040
[Guest]: That's why they really love it.

01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:26.720
[Guest]: That if you look in India, it's a massive competitive advantage, parties are splitting

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:27.720
[Unknown]: all the time.

01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:31.240
[Unknown]: Today, the Congress is one, Congress versus Congress, Kapil Sibal is saying something,

01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:32.240
[Guest]: Chidambaram is saying something.

01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:38.600
[Guest]: It's not even as the RSS points out that having a single caste party, or, you know, will prevent

01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:39.600
[Guest]: this.

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:44.080
[Guest]: Samadwadi party is a Yadav party, but the uncle and the nephew are at loggerheads, right?

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:49.160
[Unknown]: Bahujan Samad party is a Jatav party, but Mayawati will never promote another Jatav.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:52.400
[Guest]: That's why Chandrashekhar Azad Rawan wants to set out his own party.

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:54.960
[Guest]: Because if she does that, then her vote bank gets cut.

01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:59.560
[Guest]: This is the water that we drink, that we don't like behaving properly in a group when it

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.240
[Guest]: comes to achieving a goal.

01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:07.280
[Guest]: The RSS's absolute genius has been to understand it, it is an exclusionary version, right?

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:10.840
[Guest]: And the point is not whether the history lesson is accurate.

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:16.200
[Guest]: The point is that that history lesson has become a very powerful tool for organizational

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:17.200
[Guest]: renewal.

01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:21.600
[Guest]: Because when it comes to the third battle of Panipat, the RSS analysis is the Marathas

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:25.320
[Guest]: were lost because they were fighting with each other, the Rajputs and the Jats did not

01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:26.320
[Guest]: help.

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:30.640
[Guest]: The Maratha army was not a centralized command, unlike the RSS today, it was a confederacy

01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:35.440
[Guest]: where the Peshwas were normally in charge, but you had the Holkas, you had the Sindhias,

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:37.520
[Guest]: you know, or you had the Bhosles.

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:41.880
[Guest]: For them, this is the analysis of the weakness of the Hindu past.

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:46.080
[Guest]: And I would say that the moment that just struck me, that after that conversation on

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:52.440
[Guest]: Shaka, seeing this on YouTube, and then linking it to Israeli, that kind of thing takes three

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:53.440
[Guest]: years to get.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:58.760
[Guest]: So, you know, to the researchers who are listening amongst you, that insight, right, is not a

01:46:58.760 --> 01:46:59.760
[Guest]: simple insight.

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:05.600
[Guest]: You have to immerse yourself, you have to speak to people, and then one day in a flash,

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:06.600
[Guest]: something strikes you.

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:09.520
[Guest]: And now when I say it to RSS people, they are saying, yeah, it's true.

01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:15.240
[Guest]: In fact, I got one of the few reviews that have already come, the book is very early,

01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:18.800
[Unknown]: has been from an RSS gentleman who says that, look, he's the first English speaking guy

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:21.720
[Guest]: to understand us, even though I am critical, right?

01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:22.720
[Guest]: Because this is their self-image.

01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:28.280
[Guest]: And I sometimes, and look, once a book like this comes out, people will say that, oh,

01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:32.080
[Guest]: this is obvious, this, that, or we should have found this earlier, but sometimes insights

01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:33.080
[Guest]: don't happen that way, right?

01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:37.560
[Guest]: Like first time someone comes up with an idea, you always say, oh, we should have known this

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:40.960
[Guest]: 50 years earlier, but that never happens like that.

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:46.280
[Amit Varma]: No, and it was fascinating to me, not just, you know, the third battle of Panipat in 1761,

01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:52.040
[Amit Varma]: but even, you know, that whole sense of how so many contemporary grievances can be in

01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:58.480
[Amit Varma]: some way, you know, given an origin story or given that huge story in history, for example,

01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:02.240
[Amit Varma]: you point out about how Amit Shah, of course, grew up in a household where he was surrounded

01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:05.880
[Amit Varma]: by books and was well read and one of the other books by K M Munshi, which was a big

01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:11.040
[Amit Varma]: influence on him and pretty much, you know, generations of Hindu nationalist leaders was

01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:18.480
[Amit Varma]: the one about the sacking of Somnath by Mahmud of Ghazni, which is, you know, which is an

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:25.200
[Amit Varma]: interesting example of how, you know, history can be weaponized and history can shape the

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:27.840
[Amit Varma]: psychology of people and just how they look at the world.

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:31.000
[Amit Varma]: And it also kind of strikes me and, you know, we'll take an aside and I'll ask you this

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:35.880
[Amit Varma]: now instead of at the end, that, you know, does it also work the other way that does

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:39.800
[Amit Varma]: the politics that you have, then affect the history that you do?

01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:44.600
[Amit Varma]: And you've managed to keep it out of this book to the extent that I have absolutely

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:47.840
[Amit Varma]: no idea what your political leanings are like.

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:53.000
[Amit Varma]: So is that something that you consciously, you know, warn yourself about in terms of

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.680
[Amit Varma]: even the facts that you choose to gather and so on?

01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:01.080
[Amit Varma]: And then do you sort of, you know, between the first and the 18th draft, as it were,

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:07.000
[Amit Varma]: do you take, you know, not just yourself, but even your prism in a sense out of it?

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.360
[Amit Varma]: Is that something that you thought about?

01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:09.360
[Guest]: I try my best.

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:10.560
[Guest]: I mean, that's exactly right.

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.000
[Guest]: I try my best to do that.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.560
[Guest]: Because look, the book I'm writing on the BJP before Modi is the most polarizing question

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:20.360
[Unknown]: in India right now, right?

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:22.320
[Guest]: I don't want to add fuel to that fire.

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:27.600
[Guest]: Otherwise, every morning, there are like a million people on Twitter who are doing this.

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:32.200
[Guest]: I don't want the book to fall prey to, is it a pro-BJP book, is it an anti-Modi book?

01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:35.760
[Guest]: You know, that's very, very hard to do, very hard to do.

01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:40.920
[Guest]: And especially when the book is not an oblique intervention, it's a central question, which

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:43.840
[Guest]: is what is Hindu nationalism and why do they win?

01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:50.160
[Guest]: So the challenge before me was how do I make such a political, polarized topic, non-political

01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:54.480
[Unknown]: and non-polarized in a way in which you can read the book, whether you hate the BJP or

01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:57.600
[Unknown]: like the BJP, and this will help you understand it.

01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:02.280
[Guest]: And I just did a video interview with Barkha Dutt and she told me, look, this book didn't

01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:03.280
[Guest]: make me angry.

01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.280
[Guest]: She told me offline.

01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:09.200
[Guest]: And she said, I like that about the book and I hope that's how other people read it.

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:13.880
[Guest]: This book is not going to get your BP up and let's take on Modi or let me become an internet

01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:14.880
[Unknown]: bug.

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:18.720
[Guest]: This is not, it has a lot of masala, so you enjoy yourself, right?

01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:24.640
[Guest]: But I wanted it not to be an intervention that becomes a political football.

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:29.880
[Guest]: And at least in the very early days, but so far I've been able to do it, but yes, I obsessed

01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:30.880
[Guest]: about this.

01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:36.400
[Guest]: I spent a lot of time thinking about how I should move, how I should move my views on

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:37.400
[Unknown]: the way.

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:41.280
[Unknown]: On the other hand, while I didn't want to be controversial, I had a fidelity to the

01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:42.280
[Guest]: truth.

01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:43.840
[Unknown]: And sometimes the truth is confidential.

01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.880
[Guest]: So for example, on the Gujarat riots, I don't hold back at all, as you've read, right?

01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:54.240
[Guest]: I know I detail precise, you know, exactly what happened, you know, what, and too often

01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:56.400
[Guest]: we ask, is Modi guilty, Modi not guilty?

01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:00.400
[Guest]: That's not the real question on the Gujarat riot, it was a massive connivance and state

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:04.440
[Guest]: failure that you have to understand in that sense, right?

01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:10.760
[Guest]: So while I wanted to be quote unquote neutral, neutrality doesn't mean on the one hand, on

01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:11.760
[Unknown]: the other hand, right?

01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:15.560
[Unknown]: Because then when you have violence happening, when you have murder happening, neutrality

01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:19.440
[Unknown]: is not that, Oh, somebody said it's a murder, other person said it was deserved.

01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:21.200
[Unknown]: That's a very wrong way to do it, right?

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:22.760
[Guest]: But it's a tightrope walk, Amit.

01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:25.920
[Guest]: So there's no like template for how to achieve this.

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:29.080
[Unknown]: But I exactly what you said, I thought about it a lot.

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:33.160
[Guest]: And I also, you know, over time, Amit, I've learned to respect the leader that the leader

01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:38.200
[Guest]: basically, you know, once the leader realizes there's a relationship between the evidence

01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:43.200
[Guest]: you give, and the arguments you give, then the leader is able to forgive a lot, you know,

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:48.000
[Guest]: even if the leader disagrees with you completely, whereas very quickly a leader figures out

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.640
[Guest]: if you have an agenda or an angle, and that's what I tried my best to prevent happening.

01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:56.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, in fact, speaking of neutrality, there's this famous thing, there's this famous

01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:02.080
[Amit Varma]: cliche about journalists, in fact, a cliched story about how if you are, if one person

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:06.360
[Amit Varma]: says it is raining, and the other person says it is not raining, your job is not to report

01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:10.960
[Amit Varma]: them both, it is to go to the window and tell the reader whether it is raining or not.

01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:14.180
[Amit Varma]: Except in certain cases, you don't know whether it's a window or a TV screen.

01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:15.360
[Amit Varma]: So what do you do?

01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:19.520
[Amit Varma]: So to get back to the narrative of the book, you know, we've spoken about the difference

01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:24.040
[Amit Varma]: between Savarkar and the RSS and how the RSS is totally uninterested in politics.

01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:29.240
[Amit Varma]: At one point, there's this juicy quote, where Savarkar, you know, says to the RSS in 1942,

01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:31.880
[Amit Varma]: quote, what will you organize all these people for?

01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:34.360
[Amit Varma]: Will you make achar with them?

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:39.960
[Amit Varma]: End quote, and, and then you point out how the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi and the

01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:45.080
[Amit Varma]: aftermath of that, when you know, the RSS is sort of ostracized and banned for a few

01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:49.320
[Amit Varma]: months, while the Hindu Mahasabha is not, because they have a minister in the cabinet

01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:54.480
[Amit Varma]: and all of that makes the RSS realize that no, they do need some kind of political presence

01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:55.480
[Amit Varma]: as well.

01:52:55.480 --> 01:53:00.240
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about sort of this shift in the thinking and how it came about.

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:05.400
[Guest]: Firstly, I mean, I think in this, in the debate between Savarkar and RSS, I think the RSS

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:08.240
[Guest]: has turned out to be right and Savarkar wrong.

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:13.840
[Guest]: In that, this, you know, let's just take Assam, right, where a few years ago, BJP came to

01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:14.840
[Guest]: power in Assam.

01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:19.480
[Guest]: Now, the BJP came to power in Assam because for the last 20 years, the RSS has been going

01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:20.480
[Guest]: there and marching, right?

01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:25.160
[Guest]: They have these shakhas, they've been putting money, you know, and they don't put money,

01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:28.520
[Guest]: the shakha people pay the money themselves, but they've been putting like organizational

01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:33.560
[Guest]: energy into it and basically, you know, tilling the land, creating, you know, social unity

01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:39.360
[Guest]: among Hindus while demonizing Muslims, it's a both ways, that is also a jugal bandhi.

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:44.480
[Guest]: That takes, you know, that social transformation then becomes the underpinning for the BJP's

01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:45.480
[Unknown]: rise in Assam.

01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:50.760
[Guest]: Savarkar didn't see that, like Savarkar just thought that it would be politics that would

01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:54.960
[Guest]: unite Hindus together, right, without that, there has to be an underlying social basis

01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:55.960
[Guest]: that also pushes it.

01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:01.360
[Guest]: And we didn't discuss earlier that part of that social basis is bottom up, which is organization,

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.360
[Guest]: etc, etc.

01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:05.720
[Guest]: And I told you, I'm not quite sure about the data on that.

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:09.040
[Unknown]: But the other is top down, which is what the RSS does, right?

01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:13.560
[Guest]: And that people tend to underestimate that, like even today, for example, Amit, and this

01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:18.520
[Guest]: is a good sign of the RSS that if you go to any district in India, and I go and sometimes

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:22.360
[Guest]: I interview district collectors, district magistrates, who are the raja and ranis of

01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:26.320
[Guest]: the district, right, the collector, and the collector will, you know, even states which

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:30.880
[Guest]: are under BJP, they will say, we don't know who the local pracharak is, because you know,

01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:35.120
[Guest]: it's not, you know, whereas, every time you have a new collector who comes to a district,

01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:39.160
[Guest]: all the local doctor, the local head of a this, that, the local head of a granite mill

01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:42.360
[Guest]: will all form a queue to do salaam, right?

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:44.320
[Unknown]: The RSS person never does it.

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:49.200
[Guest]: And that's because the RSS doesn't need the state, it's the BJP state that needs the RSS.

01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:50.200
[Guest]: That is remarkable, right?

01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:55.880
[Guest]: I mean, I show you here in this book, the kind of personal sacrifices RSS people make

01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:57.880
[Unknown]: without accepting anything in return.

01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:01.560
[Guest]: And again, these are all things that other parties should take from it.

01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:06.560
[Guest]: The BSP had this Bahujan Volunteer Force, which was like the RSS, they don't have this,

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:07.800
[Guest]: I met people there.

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:11.960
[Unknown]: The Congress has a Seva Dal, which is absolutely pathetic, how many of your listeners even

01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:13.520
[Guest]: know they exist, right?

01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:18.200
[Guest]: So on the first part that you asked that, you know, this debate between Savarkar on

01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:23.600
[Guest]: a pure political project versus the RSS view, which is a pure social project, which is the

01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:28.120
[Guest]: view that it had at that time, right, it's turned out that the social project actually

01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:32.080
[Unknown]: benefits the political project in a way in which Savarkar doesn't understand.

01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:34.280
[Unknown]: That's the enormous power of the RSS.

01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:38.160
[Guest]: The second part of the question you ask is that how does the RSS change its mind?

01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:40.160
[Guest]: And the answer is the murder of the Mahatma.

01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:44.360
[Guest]: I point out in the book that the RSS had no institutional role in it.

01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:48.280
[Guest]: In fact, the Godse Act actually set back Hindu nationalism.

01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:52.840
[Guest]: I mean, one of the counterfactuals that I see is that the partition, the Hindu Mahasabha

01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:58.120
[Guest]: and Savarkar's criticism of Gandhi turns out to be right, that when you begin to appease

01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:01.520
[Guest]: the Muslim League, what you don't, you don't get Hindu-Muslim unity, you get different

01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:02.520
[Guest]: countries.

01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:07.920
[Guest]: Objectively, the Savarkar's view on Congress politics vis-a-vis Muslim League turned out

01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:09.560
[Guest]: to be true, right?

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:17.040
[Guest]: And with Hindu and Sikh refugees pouring into India after 1947, we see a jump in RSS membership

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:18.040
[Guest]: and Hindu Mahasabha membership.

01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:22.320
[Guest]: They could have come to power, I mean, far earlier in India compared to 1996, they could

01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:24.560
[Guest]: have come to power far earlier, right?

01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:25.960
[Guest]: Why does that not happen?

01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:31.040
[Guest]: Because the murder of Mahatma, who is a Hindu leader, is linked to the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha,

01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:34.040
[Guest]: at least ideologically, if not institutionally, right?

01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:39.480
[Guest]: And the RSS is banned, Golwalkar in jail, all the pracharaks are put in jail.

01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:43.040
[Unknown]: On the other hand, they are able to notice that the Hindu Mahasabha, which is Savarkar's

01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:46.360
[Guest]: political party, is not banned, right?

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:52.120
[Guest]: Even though the groups that were the Madanlal, Pahua, Apte, Bodse were all Hindu Mahasabha

01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:53.120
[Unknown]: members, right?

01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.840
[Unknown]: And they also realized why, which is that the Hindu Mahasabha is a coalition, is an

01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.520
[Unknown]: ally in parliament, right?

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:03.000
[Guest]: It's the industry minister, Shyam Prasad Mukherjee, who's from the Hindu Mahasabha.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:07.760
[Unknown]: And so Nehru and Patel realized that, look, it's a splinter group, not the actual Hindu

01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:08.760
[Guest]: Mahasabha that's doing it.

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:13.360
[Guest]: And the RSS realized and noticed that the ban that they were put through, which frankly

01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:14.360
[Guest]: is undemocratic.

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:20.360
[Guest]: Because if there's no evidence to ban someone, to jail someone for this long, while I'm very

01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:24.760
[Unknown]: vocal when it's the BJP that violates civil liberty, what the Congress did to the RSS

01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:31.600
[Guest]: at that time, while had popular support, is to me at least a violation of civil liberties.

01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:36.560
[Unknown]: But the lesson the RSS learned is not a single MP spoke up in parliament in their favor.

01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:40.240
[Unknown]: And even though they wanted nothing to do with the state and government, the government

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:46.040
[Unknown]: wanted something to do with it, which is why Golwalkar reluctantly in 1951, agrees to the

01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:51.680
[Guest]: setting up of a separate political party, the Jansa, with a lot of RSS members and the

01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:55.840
[Guest]: face would be Shyam Prasad Mukherjee, who has since left the Hindu Mahasabha, to contest

01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:57.720
[Unknown]: in India's first elections.

01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:05.360
[Guest]: So the RSS comes to politics because of Gandhi's murder and its quote-unquote oppression that

01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:09.520
[Guest]: it faces immediately after that, and very quickly, the RSS realizes that its social

01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:13.600
[Guest]: aim and the political aim of the party are actually quite united.

01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:19.120
[Amit Varma]: No, what you said about, you know, the RSS's vision, winning out over Savarkar's is also

01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:23.120
[Amit Varma]: echoed in, you know, one of my favorite quotes about politics, which, you know, all my listeners

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:25.080
[Amit Varma]: will groan now because they know what's coming.

01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:28.720
[Amit Varma]: But Andrew Breitbart once said, politics is downstream of culture.

01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:35.320
[Amit Varma]: And I think the great triumph of Hindu nationalism comes from the RSS recognizing the truth of

01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:36.320
[Amit Varma]: this, in a sense.

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:41.880
[Guest]: And sorry to interrupt you again, that's also the failure of the Nehruvian idea of India,

01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:46.200
[Guest]: because they didn't understand the sentence that you just said, that Nehruvian politics

01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:49.240
[Guest]: was seen as unmoved from culture.

01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:52.840
[Amit Varma]: A point that I repeatedly keep making, you know, it's become another trope of my show

01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:56.440
[Amit Varma]: that I ask my guests something I won't ask you because it's too much of a cliche now

01:58:56.440 --> 01:59:01.440
[Amit Varma]: and we have so much else to talk about, but was our relatively liberal constitution imposed

01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:06.160
[Amit Varma]: on an illiberal society and therefore was always that top-down imposition was always

01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:08.440
[Amit Varma]: sort of bound to fail in some way.

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:12.000
[Amit Varma]: But you know, having said that, I can sort of contradict that immediately by pointing

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.560
[Amit Varma]: out that the first leader of the Jansang, Shama Prasad Mukherjee, in many tellings comes

01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:19.920
[Amit Varma]: across as a remarkably liberal man.

01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:24.360
[Amit Varma]: For example, he left the Hindu Mahasabha because he was upset that they would not admit members

01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:28.360
[Amit Varma]: of other religions, which he thought was completely pointless.

01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:32.600
[Amit Varma]: And I did an episode recently with Rupur Dhaman Singh on the making of the first amendment.

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:36.640
[Amit Varma]: And there, if you just look at all the arguments and what people are doing across sides, it

01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:41.480
[Amit Varma]: appears to be Shama Prasad Mukherjee, who is a great liberal and Nehru, who is the enemy

01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:42.480
[Amit Varma]: of liberalism.

01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:46.840
[Amit Varma]: And again, all those arguments and all those quotes are in the public domain.

01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:51.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, I was struck by this very intriguing thing that you said about the Bharatiya Jansang

01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:52.920
[Amit Varma]: when it was formed.

01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And this is possibly partly because even though, you know, Shama Prasad wants to form it, he

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.760
[Amit Varma]: asked Golwalkar, he says no, but then eventually, you know, enough of Golwalkar's colleagues

02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:02.760
[Amit Varma]: want it.

02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:05.200
[Amit Varma]: So he agrees and a lot of RSS people come in.

02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:11.600
[Amit Varma]: And you speak about how this represents a movement away from primadonnas and ideologues

02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:13.840
[Amit Varma]: towards orators and organizers.

02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:17.760
[Amit Varma]: And primadonnas you've spoken about before, but you speak about how temperamentally they

02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:22.240
[Amit Varma]: are dangerous for an organization, ideologues, you know, you use the word theorems for them

02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:24.480
[Amit Varma]: just as you do temperament for primadonnas.

02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:30.840
[Amit Varma]: But the orators and organizers are interesting because this almost, in a sense, then besieges

02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:36.440
[Amit Varma]: the future of the BJP, of course, today with Modi and Shah, but even earlier than with

02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:41.040
[Amit Varma]: sort of Vajpayee and Advani, which is, you know, the meat of your remarkable book.

02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:46.400
[Amit Varma]: So let's talk about the two of them now and the very different circumstances in which

02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:48.040
[Amit Varma]: they kind of, you know, came to being.

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:53.120
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about the early Vajpayee because, you know, he's born in Gwalior on Christmas

02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:55.080
[Amit Varma]: Day in 1924.

02:00:55.080 --> 02:01:01.040
[Amit Varma]: And you speak about how Gwalior is a hub for resurgent Hindu identity, in your words.

02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:04.040
[Amit Varma]: And you also say that, you know, Vajpayee's future and therefore India's future could

02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:07.000
[Amit Varma]: have been different had he been born in, say, United Provinces.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:13.480
[Amit Varma]: So explain to me a bit of Vajpayee's background and how that sort of shaped him and eventually,

02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:15.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, led him to becoming part of the RSS.

02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:20.520
[Guest]: Well, I mean, coming to the first part of your question, from the very beginning, Hindu

02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:24.680
[Guest]: nationalism has realized that they need an orator and an organizer.

02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:29.680
[Guest]: So the first Jugalbandi in that respect was Shamprasad Mukherjee, who was, you know, the

02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:34.200
[Guest]: youngest vice chancellor of Calcutta University, erudite man, etc, etc.

02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:36.800
[Amit Varma]: He was vice chancellor at the age of 33.

02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:40.680
[Amit Varma]: And no doubt, many people will point out that people at the age of 33 are still doing their

02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:41.680
[Amit Varma]: PhDs in JNU.

02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:42.680
[Amit Varma]: They will snark.

02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:43.680
[Guest]: There you go.

02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:44.680
[Guest]: Right.

02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:50.440
[Unknown]: But Jugalbandi was very, so he was very consciously made the face of the movement because he wanted

02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:52.440
[Guest]: somebody who would speak in Parliament.

02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:57.040
[Guest]: At the same time, you had Dindayal Upadhyay, who was seconded by Guru Golwalkar, who was

02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:02.760
[Guest]: the head of the RSS at that time, to be the Advani for Shamprasad Mukherjee and then, of

02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:03.760
[Guest]: course, you have Vajpayee Advani.

02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:06.680
[Guest]: And now you have Modi and Amit Shah.

02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:13.000
[Guest]: Point being that there's a bit of social engineering that there was a space for someone like Vajpayee.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:18.400
[Guest]: And because Shamprasad Mukherjee dies young, right, or dies early, there was a need to

02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:23.200
[Guest]: replace so that to understand Vajpayee's rise, you have to understand Vajpayee's personality,

02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:24.200
[Guest]: etc, etc.

02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:29.720
[Guest]: But the fact that luck, and this is something you referred to beginning, luckily for Vajpayee,

02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:34.360
[Guest]: the very traits he exhibited was something that Hindu nationalism required hugely after

02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:36.840
[Unknown]: the death of Shamprasad Mukherjee.

02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:40.200
[Guest]: But the sort of corollary to that is if it wasn't Vajpayee, it may have been somebody

02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:41.200
[Guest]: else.

02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:45.040
[Guest]: That person may not have had the talent to take the BJP to victory, you know, so many

02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:46.040
[Guest]: decades later.

02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:51.880
[Guest]: So Vajpayee, his family, he's a Kanyakumari Brahmin, they are poor, they are originally

02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:54.280
[Guest]: from Bateshwar in what is today Uttar Pradesh.

02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:59.640
[Guest]: But I think his grandfather moves to Gwalior, which is a princely state, is a princely state

02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:05.720
[Guest]: run by a Hindu king, which is the Maharaja of Gwalior, he's a Maratha, he's a Sindhiya,

02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:06.720
[Guest]: right?

02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:11.480
[Guest]: Again, a progeny of, you know, according to the RSS, you know, the person who made one

02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:14.680
[Guest]: of the mistakes in the third battle of Panipat, right?

02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:19.720
[Guest]: And harsh critics would argue that even today, so many hundred years later, you see a Sindhiya

02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:20.720
[Guest]: splitting the party.

02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:25.360
[Guest]: It's a bit mean, but you know, I am sorry for that.

02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:30.280
[Guest]: So Vajpayee comes, you know, it's a very traditional Gangetic Brahmin family, he wears a sacred

02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:31.280
[Guest]: thread.

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:36.640
[Guest]: His brother also wears a sacred thread and the RSS happens to come to Gwalior because

02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:37.640
[Guest]: it is Marathi speaking, right?

02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:40.640
[Guest]: Otherwise, it wouldn't have come there that quickly.

02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:46.080
[Guest]: So very soon after the creation of the RSS, you know, it's been able to percolate into

02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:51.040
[Unknown]: Gwalior because the king of the Raja of Gwalior is a Maratha, Marathi speaking, was part of

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:53.160
[Guest]: the old Maratha Empire, right?

02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:57.960
[Guest]: And that's also why Vajpayee Marathi is very good because if you go to Gwalior even today,

02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:01.240
[Guest]: you have Marathi speakers and you have Hindi speakers, right?

02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:05.760
[Unknown]: And the RSS comes there and he joins the Shaka and he joins the Shaka because of his caste,

02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.480
[Guest]: because you know, he was a, you know, a Brahmin and he joins and that was the social base

02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:11.360
[Guest]: of the RSS at that point.

02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:15.080
[Guest]: And I also mentioned there that on the first day, he's wearing a sacred thread, but very

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:20.120
[Guest]: quickly he realizes that he doesn't want markers that distinguish himself from other Hindus

02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:23.160
[Guest]: and he removes the sacred thread and his own brother, I don't think I mentioned it in the

02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:27.600
[Guest]: book on, you know, in the first days in the Shaka, he cooks his own meals because he doesn't

02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:31.480
[Unknown]: want somebody who's not a Brahmin to cook his meals and within three, four days he ends

02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:32.480
[Guest]: that.

02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:39.440
[Guest]: To me, that's a wonderful story because it tells you that compared to traditional Hinduism,

02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:48.040
[Guest]: the RSS, again, for electoral logic, initially pushes you to be much more progressive, right?

02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:53.480
[Guest]: And that is Vajpayee's trajectory and his father then becomes a teacher in the Gwalior

02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:56.560
[Guest]: education system and employee of the Maharaja of Gwalior.

02:04:56.560 --> 02:05:00.680
[Guest]: He's a fantastic orator, that is Vajpayee's great skill.

02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:01.680
[Guest]: He's a middle-rung poet.

02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:06.480
[Guest]: So people who say Vajpayee is a great poet haven't read his poetry like I have, but what

02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:10.800
[Guest]: it gives him is a rhythm of sentences, right?

02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:17.440
[Guest]: That mixed with Vajpayee's extraordinary political antennae and the fact that his father was

02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:22.760
[Guest]: also a very good speaker gives Vajpayee's legendary quality, which is that he says a

02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:27.560
[Guest]: sentence that the left says is in their favor and the right says is in their favor.

02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:29.960
[Guest]: This is Vajpayee's like eternal quality, right?

02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:33.920
[Guest]: Like he'll say something in parliament and parliament will say, wow, this man is one

02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:38.480
[Guest]: of us without irritating the RSS, Arvani just can't do that, right?

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:43.160
[Guest]: So that's Vajpayee's kind of background and as I argue, it's a background that is far

02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:49.400
[Guest]: apart from the moderate personality eventually gets and what changes Vajpayee from a provincial

02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:54.920
[Guest]: gangetic Brahmin into this kind of liberal avtaar that most liberal Indians kind of said

02:05:54.920 --> 02:05:57.920
[Guest]: right man in the wrong party are two things, Amit.

02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:00.280
[Guest]: One is it's the influence of parliament.

02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:06.560
[Guest]: At the age of 34, Vajpayee becomes an MP again, social engineering because Dindyal Upadhyay

02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:12.360
[Guest]: who runs the party at that time wants a good articulate replacement for Shyama Prashad

02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:13.360
[Unknown]: Mukherjee.

02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:19.080
[Guest]: And he's in parliament from the age from 1957, basically unbroken to 2007, 2008, that's enormous,

02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:20.080
[Guest]: right?

02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:25.840
[Guest]: Whether in the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha and Vajpayee does not care who represents

02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:26.840
[Guest]: the party.

02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:30.560
[Guest]: He wants to make sure that he has the best seat to speak in parliament.

02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:32.560
[Guest]: That's his self-image, right?

02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:36.160
[Guest]: And parliament in that period, right, is an Aruvian consensus.

02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:40.000
[Guest]: Even if you're not part of the Congress, you broadly believe in an Aruvian consensus to

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:44.400
[Guest]: be respectable in parliament, you have to accommodate the Aruvian consensus and Vajpayee

02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:45.400
[Unknown]: does that.

02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:50.640
[Guest]: And he does that not because he's a half a congressman as his right wing critics allege,

02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:55.360
[Guest]: but that is what you have to behave to get respectability in Congress of that period.

02:06:55.360 --> 02:07:00.760
[Guest]: So that is the first liberalizing influence of Vajpayee, given his social background.

02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:06.160
[Guest]: The other, which has led to some controversy in the book is his longtime companion Rajkumari

02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:07.160
[Guest]: Kaul.

02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:11.960
[Guest]: They are in love when Vajpayee is 17, she's 16 in Gwalior, they study in the same college

02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:16.160
[Guest]: together, but it doesn't happen, I think, because the families oppose, but they meet

02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:21.840
[Guest]: a couple of decades later and at that time, Rajkumari Kaul is married and Vajpayee then

02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:28.880
[Guest]: has a long standing relationship with her, her husband, Mr. Kaul, Rajkumari Kaul and

02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:31.640
[Guest]: Vajpayee live together, right?

02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:35.080
[Guest]: And she is Indira Gandhi's second cousin.

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:40.640
[Guest]: She's a remarkable woman, I think one of the most under studied political women of the

02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:47.360
[Guest]: 20th century in that she plays a role in liberalizing one of the greatest politicians of 20th century

02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:49.200
[Guest]: India, namely Vajpayee.

02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:53.320
[Guest]: She has long discussions on him, say on the Ayodhya movement, she's opposed to the demolition

02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:59.200
[Guest]: of Babri Masjid, and she's a key part of the puzzle in trying to understand why someone

02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:03.520
[Guest]: like Vajpayee with Vajpayee's background began to be seen as a moderate.

02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:04.520
[Amit Varma]: No, no.

02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:09.040
[Amit Varma]: And, and, you know, I found it fascinating how you've quoted Vajpayee at one point as

02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:14.120
[Amit Varma]: saying quote, I am unmarried, but not, yeah.

02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:15.240
[Amit Varma]: So that was fascinating.

02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:20.200
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to explore a sort of a couple of interesting facets of Vajpayee's personality

02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:21.200
[Amit Varma]: here.

02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:25.720
[Amit Varma]: And one is even though Advani, who we'll speak about later, had an actual cosmopolitan background

02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:32.480
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, Vajpayee in many ways is also fairly cosmopolitan in the sense that,

02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:36.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, in that 95 meeting that you write about where Advani says that he'll be the

02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:41.600
[Amit Varma]: prime ministerial face of the BJP, Vajpayee cautions him by quoting Hazrat Nizamuddin

02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:47.320
[Amit Varma]: and he says, Delhi toh bahut door hai, and you know, he's a man who likes Bhang Pakoras,

02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:53.880
[Amit Varma]: he makes prawn curry, you know, he likes his whiskey, you describe him as an epicurean.

02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:57.680
[Amit Varma]: So it seems very interesting that, and this is something that is also say common with

02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:02.400
[Amit Varma]: Advani, whose background would make you expect this much more, but he's also, you know, Advani

02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:04.520
[Amit Varma]: is also into English literature and all that.

02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:09.360
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing is that where their political vision or perhaps a political vision

02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:14.880
[Amit Varma]: that they are sort of driven to by circumstances can be exclusionary and can have a narrow

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:19.240
[Amit Varma]: vision of what a person in India is or what a Hindu is.

02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:23.840
[Amit Varma]: In their lived reality, in the concrete, outside the abstract, in the world of the concrete,

02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:28.960
[Amit Varma]: they are actually quite cosmopolitan and syncretic and absorbing all of these different cultures

02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:30.240
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:34.380
[Amit Varma]: And this about Vajpayee seemed very interesting to me.

02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:38.400
[Amit Varma]: What was also fascinating though, which is sort of a counterpoint to that, is you quote

02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:43.920
[Amit Varma]: a family friend of his saying, quote, from an early age, Vajpayee resented English speaking

02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:47.160
[Amit Varma]: Indians, but he was also fascinated by them.

02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:48.840
[Amit Varma]: That's the story of his life.

02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:49.840
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:52.120
[Amit Varma]: And this has multiple resonances.

02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:56.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, first of all, to what extent do you feel that this was true and not just something

02:09:56.440 --> 02:09:58.160
[Amit Varma]: that this person was saying?

02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:02.520
[Amit Varma]: Did it change with Rajkumari Kaul, who was earlier Rajkumari Haksar, and as you pointed

02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:06.960
[Amit Varma]: out, second cousin of Indira Gandhi, to what extent did she change that because, you know,

02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:11.420
[Amit Varma]: he was fluent in English and obviously brought a lot more of these influences?

02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:17.360
[Amit Varma]: And to what extent does that sort of resentment towards English speaking elites linger on

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:19.840
[Amit Varma]: and shape the politics today?

02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:24.640
[Amit Varma]: Because it is true that a lot of Indian politics has been shaped in a top down way from English

02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:27.720
[Amit Varma]: speaking elites who are disconnected with the rest of the country.

02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:33.280
[Amit Varma]: And it is natural and rational, you know, to imagine resentment towards that.

02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:39.960
[Guest]: Yeah, I think that that's a key way to understand the RSS, this insecurity and this anger at

02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:44.480
[Amit Varma]: English speaking elites, like me, Amit, like, and this made my life very hard when I started

02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:49.520
[Guest]: doing interviews, you know, and the thing is, I didn't pretend to be otherwise, right?

02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:53.520
[Guest]: I didn't pretend that, you know, I was pretty clear, look, I grew up in Bandra, that I've

02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:59.400
[Guest]: gone to, you know, Harvard and Princeton, like, but at the same time, they want you

02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:00.400
[Guest]: to know their story.

02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:04.200
[Unknown]: So it's a complicated, you know, it's a complicated relationship.

02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:07.480
[Guest]: You talk about Vajpayee, but you know, Advani is even more syncretic.

02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:12.320
[Guest]: Yes, he came from an English speaking background, he knew, which is defined as, you know, English

02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:14.320
[Unknown]: before you know any other Indian language, right?

02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:15.320
[Guest]: He did.

02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:17.640
[Guest]: I mean, he knew English before he knew Hindi.

02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:23.040
[Guest]: But at the same time, he, the kind of Hinduism that is practiced amongst Sindhis of that

02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:25.960
[Guest]: period in Karachi, is a very syncretic one.

02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:31.000
[Guest]: His, in his house, you have Sikh rituals, you know, that are practiced.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:36.360
[Guest]: His mother used to go to a Sufi shrine, precisely the kind of shrine that the RSS, the Higdewar

02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:38.480
[Guest]: opposed, which we discussed earlier.

02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:42.800
[Guest]: So it's a syncretic background, and he's English speaking, he's playing tennis, as I mentioned,

02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:47.240
[Guest]: you have to understand Advani is to understand him through the catastrophe of partition,

02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:51.720
[Guest]: and his desire to make his family and India whole again, that sense he comes across as

02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:56.360
[Guest]: a much more sympathetic character in this book, than the cartoonish versions of him,

02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:01.560
[Guest]: you know, wearing that hat in the Rath Yatra, right, saying that here's a man who is really

02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:07.200
[Guest]: shaped by these grand forces of history that he's trying to, you know, come to terms with

02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:09.760
[Guest]: after so many years.

02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:16.920
[Guest]: And ironically, Amit, the quality that pole vaults Advani into the heart of Hindu nationalism

02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:19.040
[Guest]: is the fact that he speaks English.

02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:25.520
[Guest]: So Atal Bihari Vajpayee becomes an MP in 1957, and also leader of the party, the Jan Sangh

02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:30.800
[Guest]: in Parliament, even though they had, I think, only three MPs, and Dindya Lupadia himself,

02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:35.760
[Guest]: a dhoti wearing Hindi speaking type, realizes very quickly that Luckhians Delhi is English

02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:36.760
[Guest]: speaking.

02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:40.360
[Guest]: So if you want to speak to journalists, you want to speak to diplomats, I mean, you know,

02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:45.240
[Guest]: he has the same insight that Arnab Goswami has had like 50 years later.

02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:50.240
[Guest]: But the difference is that Dindya Lupadia says, look, I need somebody to help Vajpayee

02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:52.480
[Guest]: navigate this English speaking world.

02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:55.920
[Guest]: And who's the English speaking person we have in our midst?

02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:58.920
[Guest]: It's Lal Krishna Advani, who happens to be in Rajasthan.

02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:03.200
[Guest]: That's the immediate reason that he is moved as secretary to Vajpayee in 1957.

02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:09.240
[Guest]: So it's this very complicated relationship between the English speaking world and Hindu

02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:14.080
[Guest]: nationalism, given that that was a reason for the rise of Advani himself, right.

02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:19.680
[Guest]: And of course, once Vajpayee gets much bigger, his political constituency becomes the English

02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:24.440
[Guest]: speaking liberals compared to Advani, right, even though the English speaking types who

02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:30.040
[Guest]: get into the BJP, Chandan Mitra, Swapan Das Gupta, Vajpayee can't relate to any of them.

02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:31.840
[Unknown]: They are all Advani's men.

02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:37.600
[Unknown]: So you know, this is a, it's a fascinating thread that runs through this book, without

02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:42.600
[Unknown]: a, and I like it also because it's a contradictory thread, there's no clear, you know, it's like

02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:46.760
[Amit Varma]: a river that is kind of meandering up and down there, the relationship between English

02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:48.760
[Amit Varma]: speaking resentment and Hindu nationalism.

02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:53.880
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, there's a very telling quote in your book about the time where, you know,

02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:56.120
[Amit Varma]: Advani was sent to Delhi to help out Vajpayee.

02:13:56.120 --> 02:14:00.760
[Amit Varma]: And you quote an RSS man active during that period, as saying, quote, there are two types

02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:05.800
[Amit Varma]: of Indians, those who use Western toilets, and those who use Indian toilets, we use Indian

02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:11.080
[Amit Varma]: toilets, but we need some people who use Western toilets, stop it, which is why, you know,

02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:12.920
[Amit Varma]: Advani is sort of sent there.

02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:17.880
[Amit Varma]: Another sort of very interesting thing about Advani is that this sort of impression of

02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:21.360
[Amit Varma]: Advani as a hardliner and Vajpayee as a moderate.

02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:24.720
[Amit Varma]: And I think there is perhaps much more truth to Vajpayee's moderation.

02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:29.880
[Amit Varma]: But Advani was sort of, you know, circumstances almost forced him to take this hardline stand

02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:34.400
[Amit Varma]: because first of all, in 1985, he's kind of, you know, pitchforked into the leadership

02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:39.000
[Amit Varma]: of the party when Vajpayee has to go because, you know, all the Hindu vote has gone to Rajiv

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.240
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi and all of that, and then over a period of time, he, you know, becomes hardline out

02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:44.240
[Amit Varma]: of circumstance.

02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:47.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, I'm struck by a bunch of quotes about him.

02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:52.360
[Amit Varma]: In fact, and one is, of course, from Balraj Madhok, who was opposed to both Advani and

02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:58.000
[Amit Varma]: Vajpayee and Balraj Madhok called Advani, a quote, boneless wonder, who does not have

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.120
[Amit Varma]: his own character or opinion, stop quote.

02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:06.880
[Amit Varma]: And much later, you know, you quote Arun Shourie as saying of the time in the cabinet together

02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:11.360
[Amit Varma]: in the Vajpayee government, that Advani was the second most powerful man in the country.

02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:17.640
[Amit Varma]: The most powerful was the man who last met him, you know, indicating that he is so impressionable

02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:18.640
[Amit Varma]: as it were.

02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:23.680
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about Advani's beliefs, like we've already sort of spoken about, you know,

02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:28.440
[Amit Varma]: Vajpayee the orator and, you know, Advani, the organizer coming together and that's how

02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:29.440
[Amit Varma]: they start.

02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:33.160
[Amit Varma]: But Advani also becomes not bad at orating at a later period in time.

02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:34.840
[Amit Varma]: But so he's an organizer.

02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:35.840
[Amit Varma]: He's looking after the party.

02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:36.960
[Amit Varma]: The party has an ethic.

02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:38.120
[Amit Varma]: It is a team ethic.

02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:40.080
[Amit Varma]: He has a cosmopolitan background.

02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:44.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, he went to St. Patrick's and, you know, you describe an incident about I think

02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:48.840
[Amit Varma]: in the early 2000s, he goes to Pakistan and he goes to that school and they sing for he's

02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:53.340
[Amit Varma]: a jolly good fellow for him and, you know, his eyes missed over, as you point out.

02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:54.600
[Amit Varma]: So he is that kind of man.

02:15:54.600 --> 02:16:00.880
[Amit Varma]: He's also what is the sense that you get about, you know, what his views are like?

02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:01.880
[Amit Varma]: What does he really believe?

02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:02.880
[Amit Varma]: What is he driven by?

02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:06.960
[Amit Varma]: Like Swapan Dasgupta at one point said, as you've quoted in your book, that Advani was

02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:11.760
[Amit Varma]: a different man before and after the Rath Yatra, which is interesting.

02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:16.600
[Amit Varma]: But I think that is, you know, he would have reached a bit of an age there where your basic

02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:18.260
[Amit Varma]: character doesn't change.

02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:23.160
[Amit Varma]: So are these people political animals who are responding to incentives in the political

02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:28.880
[Amit Varma]: marketplace, which later determines the way that they are looked at or at their core,

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:31.240
[Amit Varma]: is there something else which you can point to?

02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Like with Vajpayee, certainly you can say that he had things that he stood up for and

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000
[Amit Varma]: strong beliefs.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:41.040
[Amit Varma]: For example, when, you know, the Golwalkar asked him to break up his relationship with

02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:44.280
[Amit Varma]: the Rajkumari, he just flat out refused.

02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:48.240
[Amit Varma]: And you know what, give me a sense of Advani in that sense.

02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:52.560
[Guest]: You know, the narrative spine of this book, Amit, is Vajpayee and Advani.

02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:57.680
[Guest]: So it was very important for me to get their personalities right, very important, right.

02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:01.440
[Guest]: And to have that, look, people change, as you said, people change over 80 years, but

02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:05.680
[Guest]: they also have to have some part of their personalities that are constant.

02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:11.080
[Guest]: And after thinking about this for three years, I realized that the two core personality traits

02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:17.120
[Guest]: of Advani, right, one is loyalty, you know, he's defined by loyalty, you know, and it's

02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:20.560
[Guest]: a trait that, you know, is very welcome in the RSS.

02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:25.860
[Guest]: And the second trait is underconfidence, he's constantly unsure, he has this Hamlet-like

02:17:25.860 --> 02:17:31.080
[Guest]: quality, where, you know, he's constantly unsure to do or not to do, to be or not to

02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:34.240
[Guest]: be, you know, in a sense, Vajpayee doesn't have that at all.

02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:38.640
[Guest]: So right from the beginning, when he meets Vajpayee, he's in awe of Vajpayee's speaking

02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:39.640
[Guest]: talent.

02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:43.440
[Guest]: And Advani himself is very underconfident about his speaking talent, right.

02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:45.600
[Guest]: He's an unnatural politician in that sense.

02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:50.160
[Guest]: But you know, he's loyal, he spends a lot of time with the party carder, the party carder

02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:54.200
[Guest]: like that, Vajpayee has no time for them, Vajpayee only has time for Parliament.

02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:58.800
[Guest]: So over time, he develops this hardline image amidst for three reasons.

02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:04.960
[Guest]: One is that he listens to the party, he listens to the RSS, he spends morning to evening like

02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:09.480
[Guest]: going to party headquarters, listening to what people are saying, Vajpayee doesn't do

02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:10.480
[Guest]: that at all.

02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:12.680
[Guest]: And the party is far more hardline than Parliament.

02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:15.520
[Guest]: So Advani becomes the face of the party.

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:18.080
[Guest]: That's the first reason why he gets a hardline image.

02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:22.720
[Guest]: The second reason he gets a hardline image is that Vajpayee liked that, because Vajpayee

02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:26.960
[Guest]: understood the fact that you need an orator and an organiser and at the times in which

02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:32.000
[Guest]: the RSS was tiring of him, he would say, look, if you're tiring of me, I'll put a different

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.520
[Guest]: party president that you like, who will also be loyal to me.

02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:36.520
[Guest]: And that was Advani.

02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:41.000
[Unknown]: So they needed the jugalbandhi, Vajpayee understood it, Advani understood it also.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.960
[Guest]: The third reason he's given the impression of being hardline today is the Rath Yatra,

02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:47.240
[Guest]: right, and the Babri Majid demolition.

02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:50.400
[Guest]: No question, that's the defining feature of Advani.

02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:55.720
[Guest]: I point out in the book though that Rath Yatra, of which I'm critical, if you've read that,

02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:58.280
[Guest]: was not because he was a religious zealot at all.

02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:01.680
[Guest]: It was sheer naked political opportunism.

02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:07.240
[Guest]: That in August 1990, the VP Singh government announces the Mandal Commission report, where

02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:11.680
[Guest]: you have reservations in central government jobs for OBCs or backward castes.

02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:15.920
[Guest]: This immediately sets off panic among the upper caste base of the BJP.

02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:20.760
[Guest]: And Advani is able to see that if this continues like this, there will be a split between the

02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:25.480
[Unknown]: upper caste and the backward caste, you know, and if it's just upper caste, the BJP cannot

02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:26.600
[Unknown]: come to power.

02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:30.880
[Guest]: So literally a month later, he announces the Rath Yatra, where he travels from Somnath

02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:33.200
[Guest]: to Ayodhya, or he plans to travel to Ayodhya.

02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:37.280
[Guest]: The Ayodhya movement is by that time already seven years old.

02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:42.680
[Guest]: So nothing explains the timing of the Rath Yatra, except that literally a month earlier,

02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:47.720
[Guest]: you had the VP Singh government, right, and I would say that that is the sheer political

02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:53.200
[Guest]: opportunism, right, rather than, you know, deeply held Islamophobia and a sign of that

02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:58.040
[Guest]: is that in all his speeches that you see there, right, I don't want to defend him, he's very

02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:03.000
[Guest]: careful not to criticize Muslims directly, which is something you hear every day in this

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:04.000
[Unknown]: government.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.840
[Guest]: You know, he's very, very careful and even when the crowd starts saying something against

02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:13.000
[Guest]: Prophet Mohammed or something, Advani is the first to shush them up, you know, saying that's

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:14.000
[Unknown]: not what this is about.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:19.960
[Guest]: That's what gives him this Hamlet-like quality that his own social instincts and the political

02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:24.600
[Guest]: persona that frankly is good for him, like, you know, it's good to be called a hardliner

02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:28.880
[Amit Varma]: because the parliament and English-speaking liberals will hate you, but the RSS and the

02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:31.920
[Unknown]: cadre will say, okay, he's one of us, right?

02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:36.120
[Guest]: But that's what gives Advani this complexity and I don't want to defend him or anything

02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:41.000
[Guest]: like that, but certainly as the beginning of the book shows Amit, he could have become

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:46.120
[Guest]: prime minister in 96, but he is understands, or you can say underconfident, or he understands

02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:50.960
[Guest]: his own limitations that if he is prime minister, the BJP will never get allies and so you need

02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:52.440
[Guest]: someone like Vajpayee.

02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:56.080
[Guest]: So he gets Vajpayee out of cold storage and Vajpayee is then the PM candidate and then

02:20:56.080 --> 02:21:02.360
[Guest]: Vajpayee becomes PM again, 96, 98 and 99 and Advani serves under him and I just think that's

02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:07.480
[Unknown]: remarkable because how many politicians, you know, are aware of their own limitations.

02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:11.440
[Guest]: Certainly, you know, today's Congress and Rahul Gandhi are not aware of their limitations,

02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:12.440
[Guest]: right?

02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:18.880
[Guest]: And in that sense, certainly when you read this book, the hundred percent negative image

02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:24.320
[Unknown]: of Advani, some of you may have, will be diluted just a little bit and the hundred percent

02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:28.840
[Guest]: positive image of Vajpayee that some of you have will be diluted just a little bit.

02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:32.120
[Guest]: They were a jugal bandhi, they were at some level play acting.

02:21:32.120 --> 02:21:35.320
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, responding to incentives, before I get to my next question, a couple

02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:38.200
[Amit Varma]: of asides and the first is an aside to an aside.

02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:41.600
[Amit Varma]: So it may seem completely irrelevant, but I remember, you know, there used to be this

02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:46.160
[Amit Varma]: news magazine in the early 90s called NewsTrack, which would go around in videotapes.

02:21:46.160 --> 02:21:50.400
[Amit Varma]: And I remember, you know, watching an episode of NewsTrack where there was an interview

02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:55.480
[Amit Varma]: of Devi Lal and it was fabulous if someone can find the clip, I don't know if it exists,

02:21:55.480 --> 02:22:00.400
[Amit Varma]: where he is basically sitting in, I think a banyan and a dhoti in the garden on a chair

02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:03.880
[Amit Varma]: with his feet up and the camera angle is, you know, at his shoes.

02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:07.640
[Amit Varma]: So his shoes are really big and he is kind of in the background.

02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:13.040
[Amit Varma]: And the interviewer asks him, ki Devi Lal ji, apne apne bete ko chief minister kyu banaya?

02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And Devi Lal says, toh kya Bhajan Lal ke chhore ko banaya?

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:19.280
[Amit Varma]: Which is a masterful answer.

02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:24.480
[Amit Varma]: But the reason this aside came to me was because of the next aside, which is again about how

02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:30.120
[Amit Varma]: circumstance seems to shape politics in the sense that VP Singh went in for all the Mandal

02:22:30.120 --> 02:22:35.000
[Amit Varma]: stuff he did partly because Devi Lal was agitating and he felt politically insecure.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:39.360
[Amit Varma]: And then Advani responds to that with, you know, the Rath Yatra and then whatever happens

02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:43.640
[Amit Varma]: happens and it, you know, it's like a domino effect of one thing after another and you

02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:45.760
[Amit Varma]: wonder what would have happened if the chain was broken.

02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:53.600
[Amit Varma]: Now, tell me a little bit about sort of the relationship between Advani and Vajpayee like

02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:57.000
[Amit Varma]: at one level, their backgrounds are pretty different.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:01.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, you point out how Vajpayee is from Gwalior, the orthodox strand of colonial era

02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:05.840
[Amit Varma]: Hinduism as it were, Advani is from the reformist strand.

02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:12.080
[Amit Varma]: He is, you know, in Karachi where he's going to St. Patrick's and he's playing tennis and

02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:16.680
[Amit Varma]: the Guru Granth Sahib is at home in one sense, he's almost like his family is partly Nanak

02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:19.080
[Amit Varma]: Panthi, it would seem.

02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:23.840
[Amit Varma]: And then they both joined the RSS and they come together and you describe their first

02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:30.600
[Amit Varma]: meeting where, you know, Shyamaprasad Mukherjee goes to Kota to campaign before the 5152 elections

02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:35.200
[Amit Varma]: and because he's not great at Hindi, the RSS sends Vajpayee who was earlier the editor

02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:39.680
[Amit Varma]: of their magazine to help him out and Advani is just smitten.

02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:44.920
[Amit Varma]: And he says about Vajpayee, he describes him later as quote, a poet who had drifted into

02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:49.520
[Amit Varma]: politics, something was smoldering within him and the fire in his belly produced an

02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:52.840
[Amit Varma]: unmistakable glow on his face, stop quote.

02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:58.880
[Amit Varma]: And at a sense, it almost, you know, it seems like and they're both deeply emotional people,

02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:02.800
[Amit Varma]: as Vasundhara Rajesh India tells you, I think at another point of the story, and it seems

02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:07.240
[Amit Varma]: to me like a beautiful sort of bromance that is developing through the book that these

02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:12.760
[Amit Varma]: are such different people, Vajpayee much more flamboyant, given to expression, slightly

02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:17.720
[Amit Varma]: more colourful life, while Advani, despite the cosmopolitan background is a very stable

02:24:17.720 --> 02:24:23.480
[Amit Varma]: personality, very Uxorious, if I might use that word, I shouldn't use jargon, but Uxorious,

02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:28.680
[Amit Varma]: however you pronounce it means someone absolutely devoted to his wife, which is, of course,

02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:33.400
[Amit Varma]: a very formidable Kamla Jagdiani, who also kind of stays in the background, just like

02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:35.520
[Amit Varma]: Rajkumari Kaul.

02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:40.240
[Amit Varma]: What was the relation like, you've also spoken about how, you know, in later in the 60s and

02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:45.320
[Amit Varma]: the 70s, they'd go and watch movies together, and they just loved each other's company.

02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:49.760
[Amit Varma]: And yet there is a sort of drift when, you know, the first Vajpayee government actually

02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:54.280
[Amit Varma]: spends his time because Vajpayee realizes that there isn't enough talent in the RSS.

02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:59.080
[Amit Varma]: And so he brings in all these other people and centralizes a lot of things in the PMO.

02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:01.000
[Amit Varma]: And Advani is a bit resentful.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:05.320
[Amit Varma]: What's the personal relationship been growing through the years like Advani makes in a sense

02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:10.640
[Amit Varma]: a supreme sacrifice in 95, where he says that, you know, Vajpayee should be the PM candidate,

02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:15.440
[Amit Varma]: and the whole party is just aghast at that, and, you know, he is the obvious choice.

02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:18.560
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that relationship and your sense of it.

02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:23.320
[Amit Varma]: And was it moving in parts to sort of, you know, look at how that unfolds through the

02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:24.320
[Amit Varma]: years?

02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:30.360
[Guest]: So, I mean, I look at this relationship, this Jugalbandi as having three different strands.

02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:34.600
[Guest]: The first strand, which is, I think, the, you know, the one that is essential is that

02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:37.040
[Guest]: they like each other, they like hanging out.

02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:41.000
[Guest]: So think about your listeners to think about friends you like to hang out with, there's

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:42.000
[Guest]: no formula for it.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.000
[Guest]: Like, you know, you, you may like somebody else, but you may not like like shooting the

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.080
[Guest]: breeze for an evening with somebody, you know, somebody else you may disagree and argue with,

02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:50.920
[Guest]: but it's fun to hang out with.

02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:51.920
[Guest]: They were like that.

02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:56.760
[Guest]: So they, you know, they, and it's hard to reduce that chemistry into three or four equations.

02:25:56.760 --> 02:25:59.120
[Guest]: So they like Bollywood films, right?

02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:01.000
[Guest]: That was an aspect of the personal relationship.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:02.000
[Guest]: They like to eat, right?

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:07.240
[Guest]: They used to go out, Advani was a vegetarian, Vajpayee was anything but, you know, they

02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:09.240
[Guest]: would discuss, you know, each other's family.

02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:10.800
[Guest]: So they would do that kind of thing.

02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:14.080
[Guest]: They had a similar emotional quotient that they could, you know, cry and laugh at the

02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:15.080
[Guest]: same time.

02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:20.080
[Guest]: There was definitely a fanboy element, Advani when he met as the quote that you read out,

02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:25.160
[Guest]: now Advani was, you know, startled by Vajpayee and look, I think one of the big strengths

02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:30.240
[Guest]: of the book is I never met Vajpayee and I mean this because anyone I know who met Vajpayee

02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:35.800
[Guest]: was bedazzled by him, you know, any journalist, anyone who sees it in parliament, he could

02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:40.600
[Guest]: make time stop and I would encourage your listeners to go at least on YouTube and see

02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:45.360
[Guest]: some of his speeches, you know, even when, you know, he's being calculated this, that

02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:50.160
[Guest]: he, you know, unlike many politicians who try to convince you, Vajpayee could make you

02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:51.160
[Guest]: laugh.

02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:52.160
[Guest]: He could make you smile.

02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:55.120
[Guest]: You know, his sentences had an angularity to it.

02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:57.960
[Guest]: He in his best sense, he had the ability to uplift you.

02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:01.080
[Guest]: Now the problem with that is that may not be the person he is.

02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:06.160
[Guest]: Many cases, many times it is, sometimes it's not, but you can get totally, you know, emotional

02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:08.440
[Guest]: and irrational if you met him.

02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:12.760
[Guest]: So many of the people who are a little critical of my book for being, you know, because of

02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:17.880
[Guest]: sort of puncturing this grand Vajpayee image, which I do, while at the same time saying

02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:21.600
[Guest]: he was one of India's greatest prime ministers, but look, he was a human being and he was

02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:22.600
[Guest]: a politician.

02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:26.640
[Guest]: Are people who met him and people who've been blinded by that, right?

02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:32.080
[Guest]: I have not, and I'm thankful for that because had I met Vajpayee, this book would definitely

02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:34.200
[Guest]: have come across as a fanboy book, right?

02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:37.120
[Guest]: I don't think India has had a greater political orator.

02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:41.840
[Guest]: And I think part of the personal equation between Vajpayee and Advani was Advani was

02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:42.840
[Guest]: a fanboy.

02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:45.200
[Guest]: He was a fanboy of Vajpayee.

02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:48.680
[Guest]: The second strand of that relationship was professional.

02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:53.280
[Guest]: Something that we discussed earlier that Hindu nationalism needs a moderate, needs a hardliner,

02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:57.320
[Guest]: needs an orator, needs an organizer, and both of them fitted that part.

02:27:57.320 --> 02:28:00.680
[Guest]: And you know, when the mood of the nation was for moderation, Vajpayee was in front.

02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:04.880
[Guest]: When the mood of the nation was for radicalism, Advani was propped in front.

02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:10.600
[Guest]: And by the way, as an aside, Amit, I think that is the most remarkable part of the relationship

02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:15.080
[Guest]: that in a country as hierarchical as India, you have a relationship that is able to switch

02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:17.520
[Guest]: spots not once, but twice.

02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:22.480
[Guest]: So it's like, you know, Obama now serving under Biden, Biden had served under Obama,

02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:26.240
[Guest]: Obama now serving under Biden, and then a few years later, Biden once again serving

02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:27.240
[Guest]: under Obama.

02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:28.240
[Guest]: It's unthinkable.

02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:30.080
[Guest]: But that's literally what Vajpayee and Advani did.

02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:34.160
[Guest]: And that was also because they were professionally compatible, right?

02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:38.200
[Guest]: In a way in which Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi were competing with the same spot, there

02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:39.200
[Guest]: was no jugalbandi there.

02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:41.040
[Guest]: That's why they didn't like each other.

02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:46.280
[Guest]: Or Subramanian Swamy and Madhok were competing with the same spot as the face and voice of

02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:52.080
[Guest]: Hindu nationalism as Vajpayee did, whereas Vajpayee and Advani were perfectly compatible

02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:57.040
[Guest]: in a jugalbandi that is at least in part a requirement of Hindu nationalism, which is

02:28:57.040 --> 02:29:01.720
[Guest]: both a party seeking political power as well as a social movement seeking to transform

02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:02.720
[Guest]: society.

02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:04.800
[Guest]: So it's like the communists in that respect.

02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:08.040
[Guest]: And that's the second strand, professional compatibility.

02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:12.280
[Guest]: The third strand, however, and that's like, literally, that's the taste that I want to

02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:17.340
[Guest]: leave you with in the book is ideology, that it's a, it's a, it's an ideology that focuses

02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:18.340
[Guest]: on teamwork.

02:29:18.340 --> 02:29:23.560
[Guest]: And even when the things went so bad between Vajpayee and Advani, for Advani, it was, you

02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:26.760
[Guest]: know, between 98 and 2004, when they were in power.

02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:31.840
[Guest]: And for Vajpayee, it was between 1986 and 1993 or 1994, they never divorced.

02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:36.400
[Guest]: So it was like one of these odd couples squabbling in the, in the park that you see, and you're

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:39.480
[Guest]: like, they're going to call the police, but they go home and cook for each other.

02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:41.000
[Guest]: It's like that.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:46.800
[Guest]: And what keeps that couple united is a deep ideological belief in the sanctity of marriage.

02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:48.400
[Guest]: That's what these people had.

02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:53.240
[Guest]: And a good sign of that is the end of the book, which, you know, I'm sorry, please read

02:29:53.240 --> 02:29:54.240
[Guest]: the book.

02:29:54.240 --> 02:29:55.240
[Guest]: Don't just see, hear the podcast.

02:29:55.240 --> 02:30:00.440
[Guest]: But at the end, at Vajpayee's, you know, just after his funeral, Advani has to speak and

02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:05.000
[Guest]: Advani could have deferred to Vajpayee, his 60 year relationship with Vajpayee in terms

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:10.260
[Guest]: of personality or in terms of personal chemistry or in terms of professional compatibility.

02:30:10.260 --> 02:30:11.680
[Guest]: But he focuses on ideology.

02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:17.240
[Guest]: He says that thinking about Vajpayee will help us live according to the ideology and

02:30:17.240 --> 02:30:21.120
[Guest]: principles that the RSS has laid for us or words to that effect.

02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:22.440
[Guest]: That's very telling.

02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:26.960
[Guest]: Because even after all these decades, even after all the love, the warmth, the professional

02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:30.520
[Guest]: compatibility, the marriage was kept together by an ideology.

02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:32.040
[Amit Varma]: No, that's fascinating.

02:30:32.040 --> 02:30:37.480
[Amit Varma]: And I'll go off on another sort of brief digression by something that you said, and something

02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:39.000
[Amit Varma]: that you wrote.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:42.720
[Amit Varma]: What you said was that you're glad you didn't meet Vajpayee because then you might have

02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:43.720
[Amit Varma]: been biased by it.

02:30:43.720 --> 02:30:46.080
[Amit Varma]: And this could have been a fanboy story.

02:30:46.080 --> 02:30:50.280
[Amit Varma]: In your book, at one point, you also write about how Advani realizing consciously that

02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:53.280
[Amit Varma]: he needs to woo English speaking journalists.

02:30:53.280 --> 02:30:58.280
[Amit Varma]: And so he gets Swapandas Gupta and Chandan Mitra and so on into the fold.

02:30:58.280 --> 02:31:01.720
[Amit Varma]: And since then, they've been complete fanboys.

02:31:01.720 --> 02:31:07.480
[Amit Varma]: And equally, I know, sort of, quote unquote, liberal acquaintances of mine, who have been

02:31:07.480 --> 02:31:11.400
[Amit Varma]: granted a meeting with Rahul Gandhi and suddenly their view just flipped and they are just

02:31:11.400 --> 02:31:16.800
[Amit Varma]: in complete awe of the guy and no, no, he's not as dumb as you think he is and blah, blah,

02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:17.800
[Amit Varma]: blah.

02:31:17.800 --> 02:31:22.280
[Amit Varma]: So what happens like, you know, and I'm referring to sort of, if you have any observations about

02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:27.240
[Amit Varma]: this human trait, that you meet this person in power, who's a public figure who is nice

02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:28.240
[Amit Varma]: to you.

02:31:28.240 --> 02:31:31.320
[Amit Varma]: And suddenly you just flip your independent thinking vanishes.

02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:32.560
[Amit Varma]: I have seen this so often.

02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:33.560
[Guest]: And it's just so bizarre.

02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:34.560
[Guest]: It's the power of raw charisma.

02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:41.160
[Guest]: This is what Max Weber said is a very key component of why politics works and boy did

02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:42.160
[Guest]: Vajpayee have it.

02:31:42.160 --> 02:31:46.600
[Guest]: You know, like Advani, I don't think you meet Advani, you say sincere man, you know, if

02:31:46.600 --> 02:31:51.200
[Guest]: you like him, you know, like whatever educated man, but you know, you won't like with Vajpayee,

02:31:51.200 --> 02:31:53.800
[Guest]: like, you know, journalists will go to talk to him.

02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:57.320
[Guest]: Journalists have told me to talk to him about some political story, and he kind of turned

02:31:57.320 --> 02:32:01.160
[Guest]: to the window and see, you know, barish suno and they go and for five minutes, listen to

02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:04.160
[Guest]: the sound of the rain, you know, I mean, it's mesmerizing.

02:32:04.160 --> 02:32:09.960
[Guest]: Absolutely mesmerizing, which is, and that, of course, at a personal level, at a political

02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:15.520
[Guest]: level, Vajpayee's command over what to say, what not to say was an enormous political

02:32:15.520 --> 02:32:16.520
[Guest]: tool.

02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:21.400
[Guest]: Like to give you one example again, this charisma, he goes to Pakistan in the late nineties on

02:32:21.400 --> 02:32:27.960
[Guest]: the bus, Lahore bus yatra, and he gives a speech in Pakistan to all the elites of Pakistan.

02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:33.440
[Guest]: And he just totally floors them, both in the way he quotes Urdu and the way he speaks,

02:32:33.440 --> 02:32:35.840
[Guest]: but also in like the sentences he uses.

02:32:35.840 --> 02:32:39.600
[Guest]: So he gives the sentence and I quoted in the book, I'm saying it in English, which is,

02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:45.480
[Guest]: he says that, you know, some people feel that by coming to Pakistan, I have put a mohar

02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:48.480
[Guest]: or I put a stamp on their existence, right?

02:32:48.480 --> 02:32:53.760
[Guest]: So that's the beautiful sentence, because what he's saying is, and the Pakistan audience

02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:58.520
[Guest]: understands is that people in the RSS who believe in Akhand Bharat, who believe that

02:32:58.520 --> 02:33:02.920
[Guest]: Pakistan should not exist in the first place, feel that by Vajpayee going there, that he

02:33:02.920 --> 02:33:04.840
[Guest]: has put a seal on Pakistan, right?

02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:07.000
[Guest]: But he never has to say it in that complicated way.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:10.880
[Guest]: He actually George Orwell, you know, should use Vajpayee as an example, because he, you

02:33:10.880 --> 02:33:14.640
[Guest]: know, he shows without telling, and then the next sentence is remarkable.

02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:20.560
[Guest]: He says, I'm here to tell you that Pakistan's existence doesn't need a stamp from anybody.

02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:24.880
[Guest]: And the crowd there goes bananas, because they get exactly what he's trying to say.

02:33:24.880 --> 02:33:29.800
[Unknown]: At the same time, nobody in India makes a complaint, the RSS doesn't say anything, because

02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:33.240
[Unknown]: at least formally the sentence seems okay, you know.

02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:37.860
[Guest]: So this charisma that you're talking about is able to float people, charm parliament,

02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:43.880
[Guest]: but it's also able to say things and not say things that is able to pay for the very different

02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:48.640
[Guest]: and sometimes conflicting constituencies of Hindu nationalism.

02:33:48.640 --> 02:33:51.280
[Amit Varma]: And how much of Vajpayee is Mukhota?

02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:56.020
[Amit Varma]: Like how much of this is, do you think is your field is performative?

02:33:56.020 --> 02:34:00.280
[Amit Varma]: And how much is sort of the real Vajpayee, because it seems to me at different points

02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:04.120
[Amit Varma]: in your narrative, you get a sense of a man who does believe in certain things and is

02:34:04.120 --> 02:34:08.520
[Amit Varma]: willing to stand up, like, for example, his relationship with Rajkumari when Golwalkar

02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:12.920
[Amit Varma]: asked him to break that down, or even his sort of stubbornness towards like when he

02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:18.120
[Amit Varma]: forms the BJP in 1980, and he's saying Gandhian socialism, and we won't talk about the other

02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:23.280
[Amit Varma]: and he kind of abandons the Hindu vote, so to say what you would imagine, all of which,

02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:27.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, then goes to the Congress and the RSS stops working for them, but he kind of

02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:32.240
[Amit Varma]: sticks to his gun till the, you know, the election of 84, which is so disastrous.

02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:37.240
[Amit Varma]: So I did get the sense through the book that there are certain core beliefs that he will

02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:40.040
[Amit Varma]: not compromise on no matter what the politics.

02:34:40.040 --> 02:34:45.560
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit more about your sense of the man in those terms that between Mukhota

02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:48.200
[Amit Varma]: and man, you know, what's happening there?

02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:49.520
[Amit Varma]: Are there lines he will not cross?

02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:53.440
[Guest]: So good question, I mean, then, you know, despite having spent three years and reading

02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:56.040
[Guest]: everything he's written, I don't have an answer.

02:34:56.040 --> 02:35:00.000
[Guest]: And that's something I learned, even when I worked with Narsimha Rao, that you think

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:04.280
[Guest]: you know, Narsimha Rao, I was focusing only on Narsimha Rao, and it was only a biography.

02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:09.040
[Guest]: And even so, there were parts of him I didn't understand, you know, and I then began to

02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:12.480
[Guest]: realize that, you know, if I think about my parents, or if I think about my wife, or I

02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:16.840
[Guest]: think about my daughter, you know, I know them so well, sometimes they surprise you.

02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:21.000
[Guest]: And I'm sure that your listeners and you also Amit, you think you know somebody very well.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.400
[Guest]: And then sometimes you realize you don't know, there's parts to them that you can never quite

02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:25.400
[Guest]: make out.

02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:29.160
[Guest]: And even while writing it, I wanted to leave that, like human beings are not mathematical

02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:32.280
[Guest]: equations where you figure them out, because they sometimes surprise you.

02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:36.920
[Guest]: And at least I hope that with Advani and Vajpayee, I make them living and breathing, and you

02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:41.120
[Unknown]: come away knowing something about them, but they also seem to have this ability to sometimes

02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:42.480
[Guest]: surprise you, right.

02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:47.800
[Guest]: So that's how I sort of told the story of Vajpayee, especially this sort of core conflict

02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:51.600
[Guest]: that you talked about saying that, you know, is he really a moderate or is he putting on

02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:52.600
[Guest]: a mask, right?

02:35:52.600 --> 02:35:56.760
[Guest]: And at times, it seemed he was wearing a mask, at times, he seemed that, you know, his instincts

02:35:56.760 --> 02:35:57.760
[Guest]: were liberal.

02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:03.600
[Guest]: And I didn't fight that, I didn't try to paper that over, and I didn't try to kind of explain

02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:04.600
[Guest]: it at the end.

02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:11.960
[Guest]: Except to say that, you know, large and great personalities are complex figures.

02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:16.000
[Unknown]: So they are like, Narsimha Rao, for example, had this deep vision for India, but was also

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.000
[Guest]: a corrupt man.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.000
[Guest]: Right?

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:21.520
[Guest]: Corrupt man in the sense, he definitely bribed the GMM MPs, I provide evidence for that.

02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:24.400
[Guest]: At the same time, he was a frugal man, the money wasn't for himself.

02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:29.200
[Guest]: So you know, it's a complex, could be very petty to his family, Narsimha Rao, Gandhi,

02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:32.240
[Unknown]: you know, he's not a good family man, didn't treat his sons very well.

02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:36.920
[Guest]: At the same time, you know, this remarkable human being, you know, outside of his family.

02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:42.720
[Guest]: And I think this desire to have just one answer I push against, and I push against because

02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:48.160
[Guest]: I don't know, you know, and maybe if I spent even five years, more years on this book,

02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:53.560
[Guest]: and only focused on Bajpayee, I may not have been able to get to the core of your answer.

02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:59.160
[Guest]: Except to say that, I think in a lot of cases, Bajpayee's first instinct was, quote unquote,

02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:00.160
[Guest]: liberal.

02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:04.760
[Guest]: But that was accompanied by this worry or this anxiety, that he was always a guest artist

02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:05.760
[Guest]: to the party.

02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:06.760
[Unknown]: Right?

02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:07.760
[Unknown]: So there is an element to that.

02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:15.800
[Guest]: But there is a magic to human beings and there is a magical inconsistency to human beings

02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:19.520
[Amit Varma]: that sometimes precludes me from answering a question like the one you asked.

02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:23.280
[Amit Varma]: No, and in fact, it's quite possible that Bajpayee himself wouldn't be able to answer

02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:26.240
[Amit Varma]: it because sometimes we are a mystery even to ourselves.

02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:29.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of the other tropes of my show, which keeps coming up is about how everyone

02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:31.560
[Amit Varma]: contains multitudes.

02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:37.040
[Amit Varma]: And the sort of the three Indian figures I always cite when I'm talking about, you know,

02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:41.480
[Amit Varma]: how true that statement is, is Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru and Vajpayee.

02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:47.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, it was very sad when Vajpayee died recently that the response on social media,

02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:51.580
[Amit Varma]: especially was so polarized that either he was, you know, the best Prime Minister we

02:37:51.580 --> 02:37:52.580
[Amit Varma]: ever had.

02:37:52.580 --> 02:37:53.960
[Amit Varma]: And there is some truth to that.

02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:58.440
[Amit Varma]: Or he was, you know, a Hindu nationalist demagogue who was just othering Muslims.

02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:01.120
[Amit Varma]: And there is a little bit of truth to that as well.

02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:05.560
[Amit Varma]: But you know, before we move on to talking about the Bharatiya Jansangh, you know, that

02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:10.440
[Amit Varma]: first leg of the political movement where Vajpayee and Advani are really together.

02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:15.520
[Amit Varma]: One final question on Advani per se, because one of the interesting bits of trivia that

02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:20.960
[Amit Varma]: struck me from your book is that he was also a sort of a part-time film critic.

02:38:20.960 --> 02:38:23.960
[Amit Varma]: And that he wrote film reviews for the magazine, The Organizer.

02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:28.400
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, at one point when, you know, he criticized Richard Attenberg's Gandhi,

02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:33.280
[Amit Varma]: because he said that why are foreigners making a film on Gandhi, aren't Indians good enough

02:38:33.280 --> 02:38:34.280
[Amit Varma]: to do it?

02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:38.480
[Amit Varma]: And that led to a tangential question, which is neither about Advani nor about cinema,

02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:45.080
[Amit Varma]: but more about sort of protectionism and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch kind of sentiment that

02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:47.600
[Amit Varma]: foreign things are bad, Indian things are good.

02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:51.440
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, the economic logic behind that is complete rubbish.

02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:57.280
[Amit Varma]: But I've come to realize that the point of that sentiment is that insular protectionist

02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:03.240
[Amit Varma]: sentiment is not even so much sort of economic, though there is, of course, a political logic

02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:07.480
[Amit Varma]: of it that your base of small traders will want to be protected from imports and all

02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:12.960
[Amit Varma]: that, but is also in a sense, psychological, and it's this distrust and resentment and

02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:19.060
[Amit Varma]: hatred of the other who comes from outside because of, you know, these centuries of colonization

02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:20.880
[Amit Varma]: and invasion and all of that.

02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:26.200
[Amit Varma]: To what extent do you think that what is otherwise a sort of an economic position in the modern

02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:30.920
[Amit Varma]: world comes from this deep rooted psychological insecurity?

02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:33.880
[Guest]: Just two points on that.

02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:39.920
[Guest]: Before we talk about Janasang and BJP and the economic question, you know, you mentioned

02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:44.040
[Guest]: that Advani was a film critic, he was a full time film critic.

02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:47.680
[Guest]: And just as an interesting anecdote, for those of you who want to do research after this,

02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:53.760
[Unknown]: that in Advani's own memoir, I think I read, if my memory serves right, that, you know,

02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:58.560
[Guest]: he had spent some time with the organizer and he had a pen named Netraj, N-E-T-R-A.

02:39:58.560 --> 02:40:02.400
[Unknown]: So then, of course, my researcher mindset, let me go and find these articles, which was

02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:06.240
[Guest]: a huge pain because we're looking at articles written in the 1960s.

02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:10.280
[Unknown]: So I went to this archive, that archive, and in the 1960s and all is not digitized, it's

02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:14.560
[Unknown]: you know, it's a physical thing and you have to kind of open it, some of it is a microfilm.

02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:15.560
[Unknown]: So it's a lot of effort.

02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:20.040
[Guest]: But then I was able to pick out that some of, you know, Netraj's criticisms, including

02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:23.840
[Unknown]: like saying that, you know, when you want to make a film on Gandhi, why are we going

02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:24.840
[Unknown]: to Richard Attenborough, right?

02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:28.240
[Unknown]: It would eventually, a decade later come out as a film, but even then he was criticizing

02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:29.240
[Guest]: this.

02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:33.280
[Guest]: So, you know, this, this is a part about this process that I quite like, you get a clue

02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:35.920
[Guest]: somewhere, you know, I used to read Shalakum as a kid.

02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:39.560
[Guest]: So maybe I just, you know, if I can't do the real thing, I do like the fake thing, which

02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:43.280
[Guest]: is a researcher's Shalakum, which is, you get a tip like this, then you go to one library,

02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:48.480
[Guest]: you go to another library, you go to a microfilm and, you know, this, just doing that one sentence,

02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:52.960
[Guest]: finding out a couple of his reviews took me a lot of time, but it was worth it, you know,

02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:55.760
[Guest]: because it's someone like you will, you will read it and you'll immediately notice it and

02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:00.880
[Guest]: use, and it's a show don't tell, like, don't tell me that Advani was a reviewer, you know,

02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:05.240
[Guest]: write some of the, you know, quote him giving some of those reviews that itself gives you

02:41:05.240 --> 02:41:06.640
[Guest]: something about the man, right?

02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:11.520
[Guest]: So the, thank you for noticing that because otherwise a week could have been wasted, right?

02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:16.360
[Guest]: But the larger question you ask is about this instinct of protectionism that Hindu nationalism

02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:22.560
[Guest]: has, let me push back a little bit against that Amit, because I spent a lot of time in

02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:28.160
[Guest]: the book arguing that Hindu nationalism doesn't really have a theory of what to do once you

02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:29.600
[Guest]: have state power.

02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:34.000
[Guest]: So it has this theory on how you get state power in a democracy by uniting Hindus, othering

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.280
[Guest]: Muslims, etc, etc, etc.

02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:41.080
[Guest]: But if you say, what is the Hindu nationalist view on foreign policy, on economics, on welfare

02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:42.640
[Guest]: scheme, it doesn't have it.

02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:47.040
[Guest]: You have Hindu nationalists over time, who have expressed views on it.

02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:51.280
[Guest]: So just like you have Arun Shourie, who is a strong pro marketer, who I would call a

02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:55.280
[Guest]: Hindu nationalist, you know, broadly, even though he's currently fighting with the institution,

02:41:55.280 --> 02:42:00.720
[Guest]: his cultural critiques, etc, etc, on Marxism, or against reservation, all of that have Hindu

02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:01.720
[Guest]: nationalist elements to it.

02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:06.720
[Guest]: At the same time, you have his former close friend, Gurumurthy, who was, you know, with

02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:07.720
[Guest]: the Swadeshi Jagran Manch.

02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:13.560
[Guest]: Much earlier, as I point out in the book itself, you have Subramanian Swamy and Balraj Madho,

02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:17.320
[Guest]: who wanted a frontal assault on Indira Gandhi's socialism.

02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:21.120
[Guest]: But you have Deep Dayal Upadhyaya and Vajpayee who push against it, and they push against

02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:26.160
[Guest]: it not for ideological reasons, but they feel that the Indian voter was actually not free

02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:27.560
[Guest]: market at that time.

02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:32.560
[Guest]: So even if they were rejecting Indira Gandhi, they were not rejecting the Nehruvian consensus.

02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:37.800
[Guest]: And that tells you, in the book itself, that on this, there's plenty of diversity within

02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:38.800
[Guest]: Hindu nationalism.

02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:43.640
[Guest]: So even this protectionist instinct that you talk about, is not in evidence when they come

02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:44.640
[Guest]: to power.

02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:48.920
[Guest]: I mean, I would argue and the book does argue that Yashwant Sinha and Jaiswant Singh, who

02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:54.280
[Guest]: were the finance ministers of the Vajpayee government between 98 and 2004, were the most

02:42:54.280 --> 02:43:00.720
[Guest]: kind of anti-statist, pro market finance ministers India has had, and I would say that, you know,

02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:05.040
[Guest]: and maybe this is betraying my own ideological impulses, so feel free to disagree with you,

02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:08.840
[Guest]: that did India a lot of good in those years, you know, between 98 and 2000.

02:43:08.840 --> 02:43:14.400
[Guest]: Once again, you know, I even when I teach, I say, the few times I show you my cards,

02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:18.200
[Guest]: I wanted to be clear to the listener that there are other cards that one can play, you

02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:19.200
[Guest]: know.

02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:25.400
[Guest]: So that's a complex answer to this question that the protectionist instinct is not embedded

02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:26.400
[Guest]: in Hindu nationalism.

02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:27.400
[Guest]: It's just not.

02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:33.000
[Guest]: If you look at the thinkers, if you look at the actions, and therefore to answer the question,

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.680
[Guest]: why is Narendra Modi's economic policy the way it is, don't look at Hindu nationalism.

02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:39.680
[Guest]: Don't look at Savarkar.

02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:40.680
[Guest]: Look at Narendra Modi.

02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:41.680
[Guest]: Look at the circumstances.

02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:46.440
[Guest]: If you want to understand demonetization, don't read like Dindayal Upadhyay, right?

02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:48.760
[Guest]: So the ideology does some things for you.

02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:49.760
[Guest]: And that's very important.

02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:55.800
[Guest]: For example, you can't understand what Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have done on Article 370

02:43:55.800 --> 02:44:00.080
[Guest]: without knowing that the Jan Sangh right from the fifties itself has said in the constitution,

02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:03.680
[Guest]: in their manifesto, if we come to power, this is what we'll do.

02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:08.600
[Guest]: The Citizenship Amendment Act and the NRC again, is based on this ideological obsession

02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:09.600
[Guest]: with demographics.

02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:14.080
[Guest]: So to understand those actions of the Modi government or the Vajpayee government, definitely

02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:15.560
[Guest]: look to ideology.

02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:21.960
[Guest]: But the Hindu nationalist ideology is silent on 90% of things we, you and me would call

02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:22.960
[Guest]: governance, right?

02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:29.360
[Guest]: So there may be individual RSS heads who have a view on it, like Sudarshan did, who was

02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:35.680
[Guest]: kind of left-wing on economics and Dattopan Thegdi, again, RSS man who founded India's

02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:37.320
[Guest]: largest trade union.

02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:41.880
[Guest]: But there are plenty of others within Hindu nationalism who don't agree with that.

02:44:41.880 --> 02:44:46.960
[Guest]: That's what makes it remarkable to Amit that on a lot of intellectual areas, it's actually

02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:52.720
[Guest]: a broad tent that as long as you don't defeat the party, split the party, you're actually

02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:55.760
[Guest]: allowed to have various kinds of views within it.

02:44:55.760 --> 02:44:57.320
[Amit Varma]: No, that's a fair point.

02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:58.780
[Amit Varma]: And you've revealed your cards.

02:44:58.780 --> 02:45:03.800
[Amit Varma]: But I'll also at this point, reveal my cards and point out that the two central figures

02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:07.840
[Amit Varma]: of your two biographies, Narasimha Rao and Vajpayee are in my mind, the best prime ministers

02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:09.240
[Amit Varma]: we've had by far.

02:45:09.240 --> 02:45:14.320
[Amit Varma]: But here I would again, sort of not exactly push back, but just state a thought that comes

02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:19.200
[Amit Varma]: to my mind that if you, you know, Jaswant and Yashwant were good finance ministers,

02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:20.200
[Amit Varma]: but they were not from the RSS.

02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:21.200
[Amit Varma]: They were sort of outsiders.

02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:26.040
[Amit Varma]: Jaswant really, you know, came from the Swatantra party and Yashwant Sinha was an earlier finance

02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:28.120
[Amit Varma]: minister for another government.

02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:33.280
[Amit Varma]: And the RSS, like you pointed out about how in the 80s, because the RSS felt that the

02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:37.440
[Amit Varma]: BJP was ignoring the Hindu vote, you know, they reset up the Vishwa Hindu Parishad in

02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:38.440
[Amit Varma]: a sense.

02:45:38.440 --> 02:45:44.600
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, in 91, when liberalization happened, because they felt that the BJP wasn't

02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:50.920
[Amit Varma]: strong enough in voicing their opposition to it, they set up the Swadeshi Jagran Manch.

02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:56.600
[Amit Varma]: So at least from the RSS point of view, you know, there seems to be some continuity.

02:45:56.600 --> 02:46:01.280
[Amit Varma]: And it struck me that this might come not from economic ideology, being pro free markets

02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:07.000
[Amit Varma]: or against them or whatever, but just a distrust of foreigners in general.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:11.040
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, but I mean, that's just kind of me thinking aloud.

02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's, do you want to respond to that?

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:19.160
[Guest]: I mean, I don't know, because, you know, look, there's definitely a nativist instinct in

02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:20.160
[Guest]: the RSS.

02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:24.120
[Guest]: The question is, to what extent does it, is it articulated in policy?

02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:25.120
[Guest]: That's what we really care about.

02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:26.120
[Guest]: Right?

02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:27.120
[Guest]: And I'm like, don't look there.

02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:30.640
[Unknown]: But look, during the Vajpayee government, Amit, there are many other areas where you

02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:34.600
[Guest]: can see the imprint on the RSS, for example, on teaching of history, right?

02:46:34.600 --> 02:46:38.920
[Guest]: Actually, RSS didn't care really about that the foreign minister wasn't from the RSS,

02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:42.560
[Guest]: but they wanted Rudlimanav Joshi to be the education or HRD minister.

02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:43.560
[Unknown]: They care about it, right?

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:48.440
[Guest]: Equally, when it came to telecom and roads, I point out, the RSS supported it, because

02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:54.360
[Unknown]: just like the RSS support for GST, it supports the vision of a united India, unity, remember,

02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:57.440
[Unknown]: that's the core idea, territorial and cultural unity.

02:46:57.440 --> 02:46:59.920
[Guest]: So you have to think of it in those terms, right?

02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:05.560
[Guest]: Because when you spend a lot of time thinking about the RSS as these anti-Dalvian protectionists,

02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:09.880
[Guest]: and then you end up with two prime ministers who whatever else you say, that's not the

02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:11.720
[Unknown]: frame in which you think about them.

02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:16.000
[Guest]: So when they have come to power, that's not the frame in which they have operated, right?

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:22.120
[Guest]: And even today, you know, on the disputes that the RSS, the Swadeshi Jagrand Manch or

02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:27.440
[Guest]: the RSS trade unions are having with the Modi government, you know, on let's say on some

02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:30.440
[Guest]: of the economic reforms that they're trying to do.

02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:33.680
[Guest]: It's not that Mohan Bhagwat is taking the side of the Swadeshi Jagrand Manch against

02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:34.680
[Guest]: Modi.

02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:39.240
[Amit Varma]: He's like, look, this is a family, figure it out, you know, which is a healthy attitude,

02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:40.240
[Amit Varma]: frankly.

02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:41.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, absolutely.

02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:45.520
[Amit Varma]: And to sort of buttress your point about Modi, there's clearly no ideology there like I did

02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:49.640
[Amit Varma]: this episode with Pooja Mehra, who's written the book called The Lost Decade, which, you

02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:53.280
[Amit Varma]: know, describes in very fine detail how everything that Modi did in government was shaped by

02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:57.800
[Amit Varma]: political imperatives when, you know, he was with a jibe of a suit boot, the government

02:47:57.800 --> 02:47:59.800
[Amit Varma]: was thrown at him and all of that.

02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:04.280
[Amit Varma]: And he figured that economic reforms would not sell with the public.

02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:10.240
[Amit Varma]: He instantly kind of moved away from it and went into status populist directions as it

02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:11.240
[Amit Varma]: were.

02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:13.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, we'll take a quick commercial break now.

02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:18.680
[Amit Varma]: And when we come back, I want to talk a lot more about sort of those two legs of the political

02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:23.720
[Amit Varma]: journey of this great Jugal Banti, first, the Bharatiya Jan Sangh and then finally,

02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:24.960
[Amit Varma]: the Bharatiya Janata Party.

02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:30.040
[Amit Varma]: So see you after a quick commercial break.

02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:33.640

[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:49.760
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Vinay Sitapati on his marvelous book Jugalbandi, the BJP before Modi.

02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:54.760
[Amit Varma]: And now, you know, we've spoken about sort of the background of Hindu nationalism and,

02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:58.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, all the different conditions which lead to it sort of coming to being.

02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:03.200
[Amit Varma]: We spoken about the different personalities of Advani and Vajpayee and the relationship

02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:04.200
[Amit Varma]: between them.

02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:08.480
[Amit Varma]: I want to speak now a little bit about the Bhartiya Jansangh.

02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:12.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, we spoke about how it originated because after the assassination of Mahatma

02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:17.280
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi, when the RSS was sort of thrust into the wilderness and demonized and banned for

02:50:17.280 --> 02:50:21.040
[Amit Varma]: a few months, they realized that we need to have a political voice.

02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:25.680
[Amit Varma]: And you know, Golwalkar, despite being initially hesitant, said, okay, let's go for it and

02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:32.920
[Amit Varma]: supplied his RSS pracharaks and his RSS people to this new party led by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.

02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:38.720
[Amit Varma]: And then, you know, who dies young, so at 51, so, and there's an interesting counterfactual

02:50:38.720 --> 02:50:39.720
[Amit Varma]: there.

02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:40.800
[Amit Varma]: And if we have time, I'll ask you about those.

02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:42.880
[Amit Varma]: But then Vajpayee and Advani take over the party.

02:50:42.880 --> 02:50:47.400
[Amit Varma]: Now this, the next phase that happens is very interesting to me, because what you point

02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:52.680
[Amit Varma]: out is that for about 15 to 18 years, they have to function within what you call the

02:50:52.680 --> 02:50:54.740
[Amit Varma]: Nehruvian consensus.

02:50:54.740 --> 02:50:57.020
[Amit Varma]: So what do you mean by that?

02:50:57.020 --> 02:51:01.560
[Amit Varma]: And tell me a little bit about what it implies and which are the areas where Vajpayee and

02:51:01.560 --> 02:51:07.320
[Amit Varma]: Advani feel that they can compromise, because they have to go with the temper of the times

02:51:07.320 --> 02:51:12.080
[Amit Varma]: and which are the areas that are so core to them, that they never compromise on those?

02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:18.920
[Guest]: Amit, I think the Nehruvian consensus, the way I use it in the book, has three pillars.

02:51:18.920 --> 02:51:22.960
[Guest]: Pillar one, which is the most controversial pillar is the relationship between the state

02:51:22.960 --> 02:51:23.960
[Guest]: and Hinduism.

02:51:23.960 --> 02:51:28.840
[Guest]: Now, I don't want to say the sentence Nehru was anti-Hindu, I mean, the BJP says that

02:51:28.840 --> 02:51:29.840
[Guest]: all the time.

02:51:29.840 --> 02:51:31.080
[Guest]: I don't think that's right.

02:51:31.080 --> 02:51:36.400
[Guest]: But Nehru certainly was worried that a Hindu majority country, where the majority of Hindus

02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:41.720
[Guest]: were religious Hindus, it wasn't just they were Hindus by name only, there was a threat

02:51:41.720 --> 02:51:44.200
[Guest]: that the religion would enter the state.

02:51:44.200 --> 02:51:51.840
[Guest]: So just speaking descriptively, objectively, without any value judgment, Nehru definitely

02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:56.320
[Guest]: intervened in Hinduism, much more than he intervened in other religions.

02:51:56.320 --> 02:52:01.800
[Guest]: This is the codification of Hindu law, for example.

02:52:01.800 --> 02:52:06.800
[Guest]: The other thing that the BJP talks about all the time, which is that, why is Tirupati temple

02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:09.760
[Guest]: run by three IAS officers?

02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:14.640
[Guest]: This of course is long standing, but it is a grouse that they have that, why has nationalization

02:52:14.640 --> 02:52:17.560
[Guest]: of temples taken place and not other religions?

02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:22.200
[Guest]: I think part of the reason was that Nehru felt that this force had to be controlled.

02:52:22.200 --> 02:52:27.880
[Guest]: Otherwise, it would go against his modernizing experiment and part of it was that he felt

02:52:27.880 --> 02:52:29.600
[Guest]: that he was a Hindu.

02:52:29.600 --> 02:52:35.760
[Guest]: So as a Hindu, he had the right and the legitimacy to intervene in Hindu affairs, especially

02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:40.000
[Guest]: because Hinduism doesn't have an authoritative church or an authoritative text.

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:45.920
[Guest]: So the modern Nehruvian state became the vehicle for speaking and reforming Hinduism, right,

02:52:45.920 --> 02:52:50.600
[Guest]: which is the BJP and the Jansans counter to that has always been, but Nehru is not really

02:52:50.600 --> 02:52:51.840
[Guest]: a Hindu.

02:52:51.840 --> 02:52:53.000
[Guest]: But Nehru believed that.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:57.880
[Guest]: On the other hand, he did not think, especially when it came to dealing with post-partition

02:52:57.880 --> 02:53:03.120
[Guest]: Muslims that he had the same legitimacy or the Congress party had the same legitimacy

02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:05.000
[Guest]: to deal with Muslim affairs.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:09.440
[Guest]: On hindsight, you can say that he was being a little short-sighted because even though

02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:15.240
[Guest]: he had a, you know, I wouldn't say noble, but he had a pretty idealistic aim here.

02:53:15.240 --> 02:53:19.560
[Guest]: It has been, you know, it does expose that the state has not been even handed when it

02:53:19.560 --> 02:53:24.640
[Guest]: comes to religion and it has definitely given the BJP an issue from an issue where there

02:53:24.640 --> 02:53:25.640
[Guest]: was none.

02:53:25.640 --> 02:53:29.200
[Guest]: And I think those of your listeners who don't like the BJP, I think the first thing you

02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:34.000
[Guest]: should do is to admit this and then to say, but so what, you know, and this was his particular

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:35.000
[Guest]: logic.

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:39.680
[Guest]: So I think that's the first pillar of the Nehruvian consensus, which is that a particular

02:53:39.680 --> 02:53:43.520
[Guest]: worry that Hinduism and traditional Hinduism should stay out of the state.

02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:47.440
[Guest]: Nehru, of course, didn't have a worry that Islam would enter the Indian state because

02:53:47.440 --> 02:53:52.600
[Guest]: Muslims were a minority, but he did have this special worry when it came to Hinduism.

02:53:52.600 --> 02:53:56.360
[Guest]: Second Amit, and you know, I'm, I'm a fan of your podcast enough to know that the second

02:53:56.360 --> 02:54:01.240
[Guest]: pillar is something you don't like, which is the role of the state in the economy, in

02:54:01.240 --> 02:54:06.240
[Guest]: society, the, you know, big brother, you know, can see all, knows all.

02:54:06.240 --> 02:54:11.760
[Guest]: That was a modernizing impulse that, you know, the Madhav Khosla, who's been on your podcast

02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:17.440
[Guest]: before, you know, made it quite clear to your listeners that Nehru's and Ambedkar's idea

02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:22.280
[Guest]: of the constitution was premised on the fact that they thought traditional Indian society

02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:24.680
[Guest]: was incapable of liberal democracy.

02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:29.640
[Guest]: And so the constitution would be this transformative, you know, and a teaching tool to teach Indians

02:54:29.640 --> 02:54:32.080
[Guest]: to understand liberal secular democracy.

02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:33.120
[Guest]: Right.

02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:37.600
[Guest]: So that I think was the second pillar of the Nehruvian state, which is that a belief that

02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:43.240
[Guest]: the modern state will be the vehicle for transformation of the Indian economy and, and society.

02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:49.160
[Guest]: A third pillar, which had to do more with temperament than policy was this belief that

02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:52.960
[Guest]: you must respect the protocols of democracy.

02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:56.200
[Guest]: You must mean, you know, respect constitutional functionaries.

02:54:56.200 --> 02:55:01.080
[Guest]: You must respect those, you know, who you actually have power over to give you just

02:55:01.080 --> 02:55:06.400
[Guest]: one example, Nehru was remarkably courteous to his chief ministers, the chief ministers

02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:11.800
[Guest]: during that time, even though, especially after 1950, Nehru completely controlled the

02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:16.720
[Guest]: Congress party and the chief ministers were totally beholden to him yet, as you can see

02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:20.320
[Guest]: from his letters to chief ministers, he was very respectful of that.

02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:25.800
[Guest]: So these were the three pillars of the Nehruvian consensus, a particular worry that Hinduism

02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:26.800
[Guest]: would take over the state.

02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:31.520
[Guest]: Let me put that in the most neutral way possible, a belief that the state, the heavy handed

02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:36.520
[Guest]: state would, from the commanding heights, not just transform the economy, but transform

02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:37.520
[Guest]: Indian society.

02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:44.120
[Guest]: And third is a temperament in which you respected constitutional functionaries, you know, even

02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:49.760
[Guest]: when Nehru disagreed with the Supreme Court, as I think Tripu Dhaman Singh was already

02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:51.440
[Guest]: come on your podcast.

02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:56.040
[Guest]: I just feel that when I answer your questions, I also answer, you know, half your podcast

02:55:56.040 --> 02:55:57.960
[Guest]: listeners come through.

02:55:57.960 --> 02:56:02.920
[Guest]: But I think that was the third aspect of it, which is that he was, you know, he treated

02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:06.580
[Guest]: even the Supreme Court with some respect, he was careful about what he said.

02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:10.480
[Guest]: So he exemplified this larger democratic temperament.

02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:17.200
[Guest]: Now, Vajpayee and Advani sort of come on to the national stage at a time when two things

02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:20.880
[Guest]: are happening, which is giving, putting them on the defensive, which is forcing them to

02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:21.880
[Guest]: play back foot.

02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:26.280
[Guest]: One is that the Nehruvian consensus is completely dominant in parliament.

02:56:26.280 --> 02:56:32.040
[Guest]: And I don't just mean with the Congress party, you know, I think that's a mistake, you know,

02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:37.720
[Guest]: for people to see that even the non-Congress opposition bought many of the principles of

02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:38.960
[Guest]: the Nehruvian consensus.

02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:43.160
[Guest]: So you can say that Rajaji and the Swatantra party, you know, had a slight departure when

02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:47.800
[Guest]: it came to the role of the state in the economy, but many of the other precepts he agreed.

02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:53.120
[Guest]: So I would say that most of the parliamentary opposition to the Congress party agreed with

02:56:53.120 --> 02:56:55.920
[Guest]: about 70 to 80% of the Nehruvian consensus.

02:56:55.920 --> 02:56:57.600
[Guest]: It was that powerful.

02:56:57.600 --> 02:57:02.560
[Guest]: And today, when you see a Modi consensus or a Narsimha consensus in India, I think people

02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:08.200
[Guest]: will find it very hard to remember how much of a colossus Nehru was both in parliament

02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:09.200
[Guest]: and in India.

02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:13.000
[Guest]: You know, today they all say, oh, he's a, you know, UP Brahmin or a Kashmiri Brahmin

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.960
[Guest]: who sort of moved to UP, what's his social base?

02:57:15.960 --> 02:57:16.960
[Guest]: Is he like Lalu Yadav?

02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:21.800
[Guest]: I mean, he had a national base and he really stood out as the hope of post-independent

02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:22.800
[Guest]: India.

02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:26.760
[Guest]: And I am critical of him in the book saying that, you know, his self-conscious elitism

02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:29.280
[Guest]: has brought the Congress party where it is today.

02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:33.260
[Guest]: So there's something conceptual in that idea, but nonetheless, he was a colossus.

02:57:33.260 --> 02:57:38.880
[Guest]: So Vajpayee and Advani had to deal with that and Vajpayee in particular, and Vajpayee therefore

02:57:38.880 --> 02:57:43.760
[Guest]: adopted the Nehruvian consensus because that's what it meant to be respectable in parliament.

02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:48.920
[Guest]: And as we've discussed before, Vajpayee, the thing he cared about the most was speaking

02:57:48.920 --> 02:57:50.960
[Guest]: in parliament, charming the opposition.

02:57:50.960 --> 02:57:55.560
[Guest]: He didn't really care who ran the party and he was very happy for Advani to do that.

02:57:55.560 --> 02:57:59.120
[Guest]: So that was the first impact on Vajpayee, the Nehruvian consensus.

02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:03.840
[Guest]: The second reason why the Jansangh of that period, now which is the Prakasa party to

02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:09.320
[Guest]: the BJP had to fall within the Nehruvian consensus was the murder of Mahatma Gandhi.

02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:15.400
[Guest]: As we discussed earlier, the Jansangh or Hindu nationalism more generally was on the ascendant

02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:20.060
[Guest]: after partition because what the Hindu Mahasabha and the RSS had been complaining about Gandhi

02:58:20.060 --> 02:58:24.720
[Guest]: and the Congress all this while, namely that the appeasement of the Muslim League would

02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:27.640
[Guest]: result in the breakage of India actually happened.

02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:30.240
[Guest]: And we don't have evidence for this in terms of elections.

02:58:30.240 --> 02:58:34.760
[Guest]: But if you just look at the increase in enrollment of Hindu Mahasabha, increase in enrollment

02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:41.720
[Guest]: of RSS between August 1947 and February 1948, which is when Gandhi is assassinated, it's

02:58:41.720 --> 02:58:47.320
[Guest]: definitely on the ascendant and people I speak to within the RSS and the Jansangh of that

02:58:47.320 --> 02:58:53.680
[Guest]: period really felt that this was their chance, that we had an 80% Hindu majority, half the

02:58:53.680 --> 02:58:56.960
[Guest]: Muslim population, no Britishers, this was their chance.

02:58:56.960 --> 02:59:03.120
[Guest]: The murder of the Mahatma, who was the leader of Hindus, ironically made the RSS and Hindu

02:59:03.120 --> 02:59:08.800
[Guest]: Mahasabha seem like a party that was opposed to the interest of the vast majority of moderate

02:59:08.800 --> 02:59:09.800
[Guest]: Hindus.

02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:15.480
[Guest]: And so, I mean, the RSS was banned, Hindu Mahasabha wasn't banned, but every time there

02:59:15.480 --> 02:59:19.720
[Guest]: was an election, you know, whoever was opposing the Jansangh candidate would bring up saying

02:59:19.720 --> 02:59:21.960
[Guest]: that they have the blood of Gandhi on their hands, right?

02:59:21.960 --> 02:59:24.720
[Guest]: And as I point out, that's not, the evidence is not there.

02:59:24.720 --> 02:59:29.400
[Guest]: So they always had the sense that they had to mainstream themselves and it took them

02:59:29.400 --> 02:59:30.840
[Guest]: a very long time.

02:59:30.840 --> 02:59:35.240
[Guest]: And the way to mainstream themselves, Amit, was to basically fall within the Nehruvian

02:59:35.240 --> 02:59:38.840
[Guest]: consensus on which 80 to 90% didn't disagree.

02:59:38.840 --> 02:59:42.960
[Guest]: They did disagree on the role of Hinduism in the state, but that was something they

02:59:42.960 --> 02:59:45.760
[Guest]: downplayed in the initial years.

02:59:45.760 --> 02:59:50.000
[Guest]: The third thing, Amit, that aided them in falling into the Nehruvian consensus is something

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:56.200
[Guest]: that we discussed earlier, which is that on 80% of issues we call governance, Hindu nationalism

02:59:56.200 --> 02:59:57.840
[Guest]: doesn't really have a view.

02:59:57.840 --> 03:00:02.400
[Guest]: So when it came to foreign policy of Nehru, non-aligned movement, when it came to his

03:00:02.400 --> 03:00:07.040
[Guest]: economics, sure, you know, individual Jansangh members like Balraj Madhok had problems, Subramaniam

03:00:07.040 --> 03:00:12.960
[Guest]: Swami had a problem, but they couldn't rely on ideology to make that case and that made

03:00:12.960 --> 03:00:17.080
[Guest]: it much easier for Atal Bihari Vajpayee to go with that.

03:00:17.080 --> 03:00:22.040
[Guest]: And as evidence of that point that I give you is that once the central hall of parliament,

03:00:22.040 --> 03:00:26.960
[Guest]: which is sort of the heart of where the gossip and the chai is drunk in parliament, when

03:00:26.960 --> 03:00:31.720
[Guest]: that consensus changes after Narsimha Rao, especially with regard to the relationship

03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:36.680
[Guest]: between the state and the economy, Vajpayee changes too, you know, and that tells you

03:00:36.680 --> 03:00:38.480
[Guest]: that he doesn't have deep views on this.

03:00:38.480 --> 03:00:42.080
[Guest]: He just wants to go with whatever makes common sense in parliament.

03:00:42.080 --> 03:00:46.800
[Guest]: So that's the, you know, the relationship between Vajpayee and the Nehruvian consensus.

03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:52.800
[Guest]: The reason I'm giving you a long answer to this, Amit, is too many both admirers of Vajpayee

03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:57.240
[Guest]: as well as his right-wing detractors used to say, look, he's half a congressman, you

03:00:57.240 --> 03:00:59.800
[Guest]: know, he was bedazzled by the charm of Nehru.

03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:01.240
[Guest]: That's not the case at all.

03:01:01.240 --> 03:01:02.680
[Guest]: He was a wily politician.

03:01:02.680 --> 03:01:06.760
[Guest]: He understood very clearly that Nehru was the consensus and he didn't want to break

03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:07.760
[Guest]: from the consensus.

03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:13.280
[Guest]: And that's also why the RSS supported Vajpayee when it came to these quote-unquote left-wing

03:01:13.280 --> 03:01:14.280
[Guest]: views.

03:01:14.280 --> 03:01:15.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:01:15.280 --> 03:01:19.440
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, one like there is something in this journey of Vajpayee and his strategy

03:01:19.440 --> 03:01:23.880
[Amit Varma]: towards sort of dealing with politics that comes down all the way to the present day

03:01:23.880 --> 03:01:28.200
[Amit Varma]: to the, you know, even the way Modi and Amit Shah approach politics, which is, you know,

03:01:28.200 --> 03:01:32.760
[Amit Varma]: again, as you pointed out in your book, you know, in the first elections, the Jansangh

03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:38.760
[Amit Varma]: perhaps, partly because of Shama Prasad Mukherjee's charisma and all that, get 3.06% of the vote,

03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:41.600
[Amit Varma]: but that's more than Hindu Mahasabha and Ram Rajya Party.

03:01:41.600 --> 03:01:48.280
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the Bharatiya Jansangh automatically becomes the primary Hindu party, so to say.

03:01:48.280 --> 03:01:52.640
[Amit Varma]: Now, one, you've pointed out how because of the political imperative of fitting within

03:01:52.640 --> 03:01:56.720
[Amit Varma]: the Nehruvian consensus, you know, they sort of moderate themselves.

03:01:56.720 --> 03:02:00.480
[Amit Varma]: But even later at different points in time, like one of the really fascinating parts of

03:02:00.480 --> 03:02:05.900
[Amit Varma]: the book is how the political wind is influencing Vajpayee.

03:02:05.900 --> 03:02:10.760
[Amit Varma]: And for example, you know, after the VHP comes up in 1964, and you have anti-cow slaughter

03:02:10.760 --> 03:02:16.600
[Amit Varma]: becoming an issue, they used that in the 1967 elections, a pivot towards that, you know,

03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:20.040
[Amit Varma]: with Vijay Rajesh India being a major patron of the party.

03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:24.120
[Amit Varma]: And in that elections, they have the second largest vote share after the Congress, but

03:02:24.120 --> 03:02:25.940
[Amit Varma]: third in terms of seats.

03:02:25.940 --> 03:02:30.560
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, then you point out about how Vajpayee, which, you know, fans of his prime

03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:35.400
[Amit Varma]: ministership may recoil a bit to see this, but he supported the bank nationalizations

03:02:35.400 --> 03:02:40.400
[Amit Varma]: of Indira Gandhi and many of the economic policies, because that's the way the political

03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:41.640
[Amit Varma]: wind was blowing.

03:02:41.640 --> 03:02:47.160
[Amit Varma]: And I'm struck by this very interesting article you cite, which was written in 1971, which

03:02:47.160 --> 03:02:52.820
[Amit Varma]: Vajpayee wrote, but under the sort of pen name of Urs William Sewak, where he spoke

03:02:52.820 --> 03:02:59.640
[Amit Varma]: about the need to balance ideology and power and to realize that if you wanted to go with

03:02:59.640 --> 03:03:05.480
[Amit Varma]: power, you had to, at some levels in the political sphere, compromise on ideology.

03:03:05.480 --> 03:03:10.200
[Amit Varma]: And you speak about how, you know, when Golwalkar reads this, he realizes pen name or no pen

03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:14.280
[Amit Varma]: name only Vajpayee can write like this and he calls Vajpayee over to chat with him.

03:03:14.280 --> 03:03:19.360
[Amit Varma]: And he realizes that Vajpayee in a sense is right, that the RSS needs to take a step back

03:03:19.360 --> 03:03:23.240
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, let Vajpayee kind of go down this route.

03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:28.480
[Amit Varma]: Now, this sort of leads me to this larger question that even in modern times, and this

03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:33.960
[Amit Varma]: is a question I've had, that on the one hand, we see the BJP today taking Hindutva almost

03:03:33.960 --> 03:03:39.720
[Amit Varma]: to its logical sort of conclusion, where many of the things that they aimed for in that

03:03:39.720 --> 03:03:45.240
[Amit Varma]: period of time, like the building of temple and the abolition of 370 and all that is gradually

03:03:45.240 --> 03:03:50.040
[Amit Varma]: being achieved, but at the same time, there is, again, a trade off to be made between

03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:54.920
[Amit Varma]: pure ideology and the will to power, so to say, which Amit Shah exemplifies.

03:03:54.920 --> 03:03:59.940
[Amit Varma]: So on the one hand, you see this ideological purity, which is finding more expression.

03:03:59.940 --> 03:04:04.480
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, you also have a will to power where, for example, under Amit Shah,

03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:08.240
[Amit Varma]: they'll do what I would call in the political sphere, mergers and acquisitions, where they'll

03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:15.160
[Amit Varma]: buy 50 MPs from this party or, you know, co-op leaders from some other party, and all of

03:04:15.160 --> 03:04:16.160
[Amit Varma]: that.

03:04:16.160 --> 03:04:21.840
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, in this balance, in this trade off between politics and ideology, where,

03:04:21.840 --> 03:04:26.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, Vajpayee realized that you have to, you know, you can't go too far towards

03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:29.920
[Amit Varma]: ideology, politics has to reign supreme, you have to respond to the incentives and the

03:04:29.920 --> 03:04:34.480
[Amit Varma]: atmosphere of the time, which is why relative liberalizers of the 70s, like Balraj Madhok

03:04:34.480 --> 03:04:38.480
[Amit Varma]: and Subramanian Swamy were eventually sidelined.

03:04:38.480 --> 03:04:43.880
[Amit Varma]: But you know, if we look at the party today, for example, how do you view this trade off?

03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:52.000
[Amit Varma]: Does a party risk losing its soul, so to say, if it compromises too much for political purposes,

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:55.240
[Amit Varma]: like we can look at parties like the Congress and all and say they have no soul at all,

03:04:55.240 --> 03:04:56.240
[Amit Varma]: so it doesn't really matter.

03:04:56.240 --> 03:05:03.280
[Amit Varma]: But the BJP is a firmly ideological party, and yet it is this will to power and the accumulated

03:05:03.280 --> 03:05:06.760
[Amit Varma]: organizational wisdom of a century that has got them to where they are today?

03:05:06.760 --> 03:05:09.280
[Guest]: Well, I mean, that's a deep question, right?

03:05:09.280 --> 03:05:13.680
[Guest]: And first up, I want to remind your listeners that, you know, I don't think anyone has read

03:05:13.680 --> 03:05:18.480
[Guest]: the book as carefully as Amit, but that doesn't mean you only hear this podcast and not buy

03:05:18.480 --> 03:05:19.480
[Guest]: the book.

03:05:19.480 --> 03:05:22.920
[Guest]: That's what I'm worried about, Amit, because you've read it so carefully that, you know,

03:05:22.920 --> 03:05:26.120
[Guest]: the reader may feel, you know, why should we buy the book, please buy the book, it's

03:05:26.120 --> 03:05:27.560
[Guest]: available on Amazon.

03:05:27.560 --> 03:05:32.880
[Guest]: No matter how closely and in detail Amit has read the book, it's not a substitute to buying

03:05:32.880 --> 03:05:33.880
[Guest]: the book.

03:05:33.880 --> 03:05:37.640
[Guest]: So I must put an advertisement, Amit, because, you know, you know everything about the book.

03:05:37.640 --> 03:05:38.640
[Amit Varma]: So I have to.

03:05:38.640 --> 03:05:44.040
[Amit Varma]: I second, I second that and in the sense I second your recommendation, and I have to

03:05:44.040 --> 03:05:48.240
[Amit Varma]: point out that my listeners, you know, there is a meme on Twitter where people have seen

03:05:48.240 --> 03:05:51.840
[Amit Varma]: in the unseen bookshelves with all the books I've bought because of my episodes.

03:05:51.840 --> 03:05:53.440
[Amit Varma]: So don't worry about that.

03:05:53.440 --> 03:05:56.280
[Amit Varma]: Everybody's going to go out and buy the beautiful book.

03:05:56.280 --> 03:05:57.280
[Amit Varma]: But let's let's.

03:05:57.280 --> 03:05:58.280
[Guest]: Thanks.

03:05:58.280 --> 03:05:59.280
[Guest]: Thanks, Amit.

03:05:59.280 --> 03:06:03.640
[Guest]: Well, so look, here's why the question you ask is deep, right, which is that at the heart

03:06:03.640 --> 03:06:08.440
[Guest]: of Hindu nationalism is, you know, you call it will to power and ideology, right?

03:06:08.440 --> 03:06:14.000
[Guest]: Let me call it it's a conventional party seating power, which is your will to power argument.

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:19.920
[Guest]: And two is it's a, you know, it's an ideological movement radically seeking to reshape society.

03:06:19.920 --> 03:06:21.760
[Guest]: And there is this tension.

03:06:21.760 --> 03:06:24.600
[Guest]: And this tension is always on yin and yang.

03:06:24.600 --> 03:06:28.200
[Guest]: So I wouldn't say that there's a, you know, we discussed this earlier, there's no, you

03:06:28.200 --> 03:06:32.600
[Guest]: know, movement towards radicalism necessarily that, you know, the nature of India is always

03:06:32.600 --> 03:06:36.760
[Guest]: you are moderate Hindus, you are radical Hindus, you know, you have plenty of people who don't

03:06:36.760 --> 03:06:41.520
[Guest]: think of themselves as Hindus, that a political party that you know, wins enormously, the

03:06:41.520 --> 03:06:43.840
[Guest]: word enormous only means less than 50%.

03:06:43.840 --> 03:06:48.480
[Guest]: So I think the highest vote share any Prime Minister has got is Rajiv Gandhi in 1984 on

03:06:48.480 --> 03:06:53.280
[Guest]: the back of his mother's murder, and even he got less than one in two voters, right?

03:06:53.280 --> 03:06:58.360
[Guest]: So you always have some other party, you know, the opposition, you have adequate unity, then

03:06:58.360 --> 03:07:02.480
[Guest]: that puts the you know, BJP or the Congress on the back burner and then forces you to

03:07:02.480 --> 03:07:04.760
[Guest]: be moderate to try to get allies.

03:07:04.760 --> 03:07:10.600
[Guest]: So the dynamic that you talk about, right, is a yin and yang is an up and down, right?

03:07:10.600 --> 03:07:13.080
[Guest]: It's never moving towards one particular direction.

03:07:13.080 --> 03:07:17.920
[Guest]: To give you one just one example, when it came to the Citizenship Amendment Act, there's

03:07:17.920 --> 03:07:21.080
[Guest]: a reason I think that it was Amit Shah who presented it.

03:07:21.080 --> 03:07:24.840
[Guest]: And if my memory serves, and I think your listeners can check that Narendra Modi made

03:07:24.840 --> 03:07:29.040
[Guest]: sure that he wasn't in parliament, you know, because he wanted to, you know, it was so

03:07:29.040 --> 03:07:30.040
[Guest]: radical, right?

03:07:30.040 --> 03:07:34.200
[Guest]: And he was afraid what the press what the foreign press would say, that Modi wanted

03:07:34.200 --> 03:07:35.360
[Guest]: to appear moderate, right?

03:07:35.360 --> 03:07:39.760
[Guest]: Now, Modi is not more moderate than Amit Shah, they both are cut off the same cloth.

03:07:39.760 --> 03:07:46.080
[Guest]: But that that the point being that the ideology of Hindu nationalism itself needs this jugalbandi,

03:07:46.080 --> 03:07:47.080
[Guest]: right?

03:07:47.080 --> 03:07:50.200
[Guest]: Which is why right in the beginning, you see the jugalbandi of Shyam Prashad Mukherjee

03:07:50.200 --> 03:07:54.280
[Guest]: and Dindya Lopadia, you can call it moderate and hardline, but the other way you can see

03:07:54.280 --> 03:08:00.040
[Guest]: it is one cares about the ideology, the other cares about what you call will to power, right?

03:08:00.040 --> 03:08:05.080
[Guest]: It's true that the BJP under Modi is able to kind of break political parties, but the

03:08:05.080 --> 03:08:10.820
[Guest]: ability of Vajpayee to reach out to parties in return like AIDMK wanted very opportunistic

03:08:10.820 --> 03:08:13.960
[Guest]: things that that predates Amit Shah and Modi.

03:08:13.960 --> 03:08:18.600
[Guest]: So this is a I mean, it's a good question that you asked, because the answer to this

03:08:18.600 --> 03:08:21.200
[Guest]: puzzle is jugalbandi, right?

03:08:21.200 --> 03:08:26.960
[Guest]: That jugalbandi provides a team ethic of teamwork, where given that you have this inevitable

03:08:26.960 --> 03:08:32.120
[Guest]: yin and yang, this radical, this moderate, this hardline, you know, soft line, you need

03:08:32.120 --> 03:08:33.560
[Guest]: to stick it together.

03:08:33.560 --> 03:08:37.560
[Guest]: Because in many other parties, when this happens, Amit, you end up with a split.

03:08:37.560 --> 03:08:41.600
[Guest]: So the other party, for example, where this happens very often is the Communist Party,

03:08:41.600 --> 03:08:45.560
[Guest]: which is both a movement seeking to reshape society as well as, you know, at least after

03:08:45.560 --> 03:08:49.920
[Guest]: the 1950s, tactically a believer in bourgeois democracy.

03:08:49.920 --> 03:08:54.800
[Guest]: But and you did like have some kind of this dynamic, I think you had when Jyoti Basu was

03:08:54.800 --> 03:08:58.880
[Guest]: in his height of his power in Bengal, you had Jyoti Basu running the government and

03:08:58.880 --> 03:09:03.280
[Guest]: I think you had Pramod Das Gupta running the party, again, the same dynamic.

03:09:03.280 --> 03:09:08.360
[Guest]: But you know, while that jugalbandi stayed, the communists in general have been plagued

03:09:08.360 --> 03:09:09.800
[Guest]: by a lot of splits.

03:09:09.800 --> 03:09:13.000
[Guest]: The biggest split Amit is between overground and underground.

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:17.040
[Guest]: So if you look at the Communist Party in India in Bihar at the moment, a lot of people were

03:09:17.040 --> 03:09:21.920
[Guest]: surprised that the Communist Party did unusually well in the in the results last month.

03:09:21.920 --> 03:09:24.080
[Guest]: But you know, it has a very old history in Bihar.

03:09:24.080 --> 03:09:30.920
[Guest]: In fact, I think it's produced Communist Party CPI MLAs from Patna itself, I think Dr. Sen.

03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:35.760
[Guest]: So it has a whole history, but it would have done even better if it had been able to solve

03:09:35.760 --> 03:09:41.280
[Guest]: this very dynamic that you identify in Hindu nationalism, when the underground and overground

03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:42.280
[Guest]: get together.

03:09:42.280 --> 03:09:47.920
[Guest]: Why did the CPI split into CPM and the CPM has split into the Maoists because they simply,

03:09:47.920 --> 03:09:50.120
[Guest]: you know, they could not accommodate the radicals.

03:09:50.120 --> 03:09:51.120
[Guest]: They just couldn't, right.

03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:54.600
[Guest]: And there the definition of radical is that you believe in taking up arms against the

03:09:54.600 --> 03:09:55.600
[Guest]: state.

03:09:55.600 --> 03:10:00.840
[Guest]: And I think it has hurt the communist movement hugely, you know, the splits and this constant

03:10:00.840 --> 03:10:04.480
[Guest]: anxiety about whether you should be underground or overground, I think the underground movement

03:10:04.480 --> 03:10:07.840
[Guest]: has given a bad name to the overground communists.

03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:14.160
[Guest]: So the dynamic that you talk about is not peculiar to the BJP, because it happens in

03:10:14.160 --> 03:10:16.520
[Guest]: many parties that are also movements.

03:10:16.520 --> 03:10:21.100
[Guest]: The solution to that problem is peculiar to the to the BJP.

03:10:21.100 --> 03:10:27.000
[Amit Varma]: So let's kind of move on to, you know, what is the big rupture, you know, in the politics

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:31.080
[Amit Varma]: of the Hindu nationalist movement and a big rupture in Indian politics as well, which

03:10:31.080 --> 03:10:35.360
[Amit Varma]: is the emergency where, you know, so many opposition leaders get jailed.

03:10:35.360 --> 03:10:39.680
[Amit Varma]: And what you see during that time is that all of these parties, you know, from Jayprakash

03:10:39.680 --> 03:10:45.080
[Amit Varma]: Narayan on where he stands in the spectrum and Vajpayee and so on are like, let's leave

03:10:45.080 --> 03:10:46.080
[Amit Varma]: everything aside.

03:10:46.080 --> 03:10:47.080
[Amit Varma]: Let's just unite.

03:10:47.080 --> 03:10:49.680
[Amit Varma]: And it's pure will to power there more than ideology.

03:10:49.680 --> 03:10:53.020
[Amit Varma]: And they all come together and you point out about how after the emergency, when the coalition

03:10:53.020 --> 03:10:58.080
[Amit Varma]: wins power, you know, the Bharatiya Jan Sangh realizes that we have the most seats of all

03:10:58.080 --> 03:11:00.320
[Amit Varma]: the parties, but we won't make a bid for PM.

03:11:00.320 --> 03:11:04.040
[Amit Varma]: And there are, of course, three candidates, Murarji Desai, Charan Singh and Jagjivan Ram.

03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:10.400
[Amit Varma]: And again, it's sort of the strategic astuteness of Vajpayee that, you know, he supports Jagjivan

03:11:10.400 --> 03:11:15.160
[Amit Varma]: Ram because his thinking is Jagjivan Ram is a Harijan and therefore, this whole project

03:11:15.160 --> 03:11:20.640
[Amit Varma]: of expanding the Hindu vote to include, you know, all castes and so on will be helped

03:11:20.640 --> 03:11:22.520
[Amit Varma]: if Jagjivan Ram comes to power.

03:11:22.520 --> 03:11:26.640
[Amit Varma]: But the Janata experiment, as we know, kind of fails.

03:11:26.640 --> 03:11:31.000
[Amit Varma]: And after that, you know, Vajpayee and Advani form the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is

03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:33.560
[Amit Varma]: suddenly committed to Gandhian socialism.

03:11:33.560 --> 03:11:40.200
[Amit Varma]: And the vision seems entirely different from whatever it was before, to the extent that,

03:11:40.200 --> 03:11:45.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, they disassociate themselves from, you know, religious imagery and language and

03:11:45.400 --> 03:11:49.720
[Amit Varma]: rhetoric and all of that, to the point where the RSS stopped supporting them, you know.

03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:54.240
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, you could say Vajpayee makes that shift at exactly the wrong time when

03:11:54.240 --> 03:11:56.120
[Amit Varma]: the political winds are shifting.

03:11:56.120 --> 03:12:01.000
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that period and why are Vajpayee and Advani going into

03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:05.800
[Amit Varma]: this interesting direction and, you know, what do the changing political winds then

03:12:05.800 --> 03:12:06.800
[Guest]: mean for them?

03:12:06.800 --> 03:12:11.800
[Guest]: Amit, the direction that Vajpayee chooses is driven by one thing, which is that where

03:12:11.800 --> 03:12:13.960
[Guest]: he thinks the voter is headed.

03:12:13.960 --> 03:12:20.520
[Guest]: Vajpayee's analysis of the 1970s in India is even though the Congress is in decline,

03:12:20.520 --> 03:12:25.000
[Guest]: Congressism or the Nehruvian consensus has not been rejected by the voter.

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:30.800
[Guest]: So while the voter in 1977 rejects Indira Gandhi, they don't reject the larger principles

03:12:30.800 --> 03:12:33.720
[Guest]: on which the Nehruvian consensus is built.

03:12:33.720 --> 03:12:39.440
[Guest]: More importantly, even the anti-Indira political parties, the BLD, Jai Prakash Narayan, they

03:12:39.440 --> 03:12:41.960
[Guest]: don't fundamentally reject the Nehruvian consensus.

03:12:41.960 --> 03:12:46.000
[Guest]: What they don't like is the authoritarian figure of Indira Gandhi.

03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:51.240
[Guest]: And Vajpayee realizes that for the Jan Sangh to become mainstream, there is no other, this

03:12:51.240 --> 03:12:52.880
[Guest]: is the only opposition in town.

03:12:52.880 --> 03:12:56.200
[Guest]: So if you want to take down the Congress, which is the hundred pound gorilla in the

03:12:56.200 --> 03:13:04.240
[Guest]: room, you have to merge yourself into a non-Congress opposition, which actually shares many of

03:13:04.240 --> 03:13:08.840
[Guest]: the precepts of the Nehruvian consensus, which is what he's able to do.

03:13:08.840 --> 03:13:14.960
[Guest]: And as you pointed out, Jan Sangh is the largest constituent of the Janata party in the 77

03:13:14.960 --> 03:13:15.960
[Guest]: elections.

03:13:15.960 --> 03:13:20.000
[Guest]: So logically, Vajpayee should have been prime minister, but they don't even begin to ask

03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:24.040
[Guest]: that question because they're like, look, we're grateful that we're part of you.

03:13:24.040 --> 03:13:26.960
[Guest]: You know, that's not even, let's not ask for more than we can get.

03:13:26.960 --> 03:13:34.360
[Guest]: And that again shows a certain sagacity and a certain ability to avoid the immediate greed

03:13:34.360 --> 03:13:35.360
[Guest]: of power.

03:13:35.360 --> 03:13:36.360
[Guest]: They're interested in the long game.

03:13:36.360 --> 03:13:37.360
[Guest]: They are marathon runners.

03:13:37.360 --> 03:13:39.760
[Guest]: They are not hundred meter runners.

03:13:39.760 --> 03:13:41.680
[Guest]: And I think that's something quite remarkable.

03:13:41.680 --> 03:13:45.200
[Guest]: And the other aspect that you pointed out, which is that not just Vajpayee, but even

03:13:45.200 --> 03:13:47.000
[Guest]: the RSS wanted Jagjivan Ram.

03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:49.160
[Guest]: Jagjivan Ram, by the way, is a complex figure.

03:13:49.160 --> 03:13:52.960
[Guest]: I mean, his father was a priest, you know, he knew Sanskrit.

03:13:52.960 --> 03:13:56.160
[Guest]: So he was scheduled caste, but he was highly Sanskritized.

03:13:56.160 --> 03:14:01.000
[Guest]: But they wanted the symbolism of a Dalit prime minister, India's first, and I think only

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:04.840
[Guest]: Dalit prime minister would have come through because the Jan Sangh wanted him.

03:14:04.840 --> 03:14:08.200
[Guest]: And that was stymied by other parties, namely Charan Singh.

03:14:08.200 --> 03:14:11.680
[Guest]: But again, it tells you something about the party, right?

03:14:11.680 --> 03:14:16.880
[Guest]: While they are in power between 1977 and 80, they don't go outside the Nehruvian consensus.

03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:21.400
[Guest]: This is more classically the case when it comes to foreign policy that Vajpayee continues

03:14:21.400 --> 03:14:24.920
[Guest]: to follow the non-aligned movement in some sense.

03:14:24.920 --> 03:14:26.800
[Guest]: So they are very, very careful.

03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:31.720
[Guest]: And I think that again, that shows a certain ability to sort of run the long distance rather

03:14:31.720 --> 03:14:33.680
[Guest]: than short distance.

03:14:33.680 --> 03:14:37.480
[Unknown]: The problem again, not for India, which I leave your listeners to decide what is in

03:14:37.480 --> 03:14:38.480
[Guest]: India's interest.

03:14:38.480 --> 03:14:45.240
[Guest]: But the problem for Hindu nationalism is that this analysis that Vajpayee has of the Indian

03:14:45.240 --> 03:14:50.400
[Guest]: voter in the 70s, he carries over to the 80s, but a lot of changes are happening in the

03:14:50.400 --> 03:14:51.400
[Guest]: 80s.

03:14:51.400 --> 03:14:54.000
[Guest]: There's the breakdown of the Congress system.

03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:58.040
[Guest]: There's Hindu anxiety because of the Khalistan movement, which is targeting Hindus of all

03:14:58.040 --> 03:14:59.040
[Guest]: castes.

03:14:59.040 --> 03:15:04.200
[Guest]: There's an anxiety among upper caste Hindus in North India, for example, Gujarat, where

03:15:04.200 --> 03:15:06.840
[Guest]: there is an increase in OBC reservations.

03:15:06.840 --> 03:15:12.240
[Guest]: And there's a sense that Saudi petrodollars is expanding conversions of lower caste Hindus

03:15:12.240 --> 03:15:13.240
[Guest]: into Muslims.

03:15:13.240 --> 03:15:14.240
[Guest]: So there's a sense of anxiety.

03:15:14.240 --> 03:15:18.760
[Guest]: And again, not my job to judge whether it's a valid anxiety or not, but there is an anxiety

03:15:18.760 --> 03:15:20.440
[Guest]: and it's demand drawn.

03:15:20.440 --> 03:15:24.960
[Guest]: Now at precisely this time, Vajpayee, who one of the core arguments I make in this book

03:15:24.960 --> 03:15:26.760
[Guest]: is he's not a mass politician.

03:15:26.760 --> 03:15:28.320
[Guest]: He has his year to parliament.

03:15:28.320 --> 03:15:29.760
[Guest]: He doesn't have his year to the ground.

03:15:29.760 --> 03:15:33.480
[Guest]: And there's a difference between the two, because changes in the ground may take a little

03:15:33.480 --> 03:15:35.280
[Guest]: while to percolate to parliament.

03:15:35.280 --> 03:15:36.280
[Guest]: It's not immediate.

03:15:36.280 --> 03:15:39.880
[Guest]: Whereas I think someone like Indira Gandhi and Narendra Modi have a direct connect with

03:15:39.880 --> 03:15:40.880
[Guest]: the voters.

03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:42.160
[Guest]: So Vajpayee doesn't get it.

03:15:42.160 --> 03:15:47.760
[Guest]: So even in the early 80s, when the Bharatiya Janata Party is created in 1980, he actually

03:15:47.760 --> 03:15:51.640
[Guest]: wants it to be a continuation of Jayaprakash Narayan's vision.

03:15:51.640 --> 03:15:57.000
[Guest]: Hence, even the name, I think the most important relic of the Janata experiment that remains

03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:59.200
[Guest]: today is the name Bharatiya Janata Party.

03:15:59.200 --> 03:16:03.400
[Guest]: It's the same name, he just put Bharatiya in front of it.

03:16:03.400 --> 03:16:07.600
[Guest]: He made sure that there was a prominent Muslim leader, Sikandar Bhakta.

03:16:07.600 --> 03:16:11.680
[Guest]: He said very clearly that we don't follow, we won't follow Hindu nationalist ideology.

03:16:11.680 --> 03:16:14.960
[Guest]: We will follow Jayaprakash Narayan's ideology.

03:16:14.960 --> 03:16:20.040
[Guest]: What we will do is we follow Hindu nationalist discipline, because what he felt the Janata

03:16:20.040 --> 03:16:22.600
[Guest]: experiment lacked was just discipline and teamwork.

03:16:22.600 --> 03:16:27.400
[Guest]: So he wanted to take Hindu nationalist teamwork with Jayaprakash's ideology.

03:16:27.400 --> 03:16:31.160
[Guest]: And as I point out, you know, in the early 1980s, he's exactly wrong.

03:16:31.160 --> 03:16:36.520
[Guest]: Again, it's not anxiety that is created by the RSS or VHP, but the RSS and VHP see this

03:16:36.520 --> 03:16:40.880
[Guest]: and they see that the party of the Hindus, the BJP is actually turning left, is turning

03:16:40.880 --> 03:16:41.880
[Guest]: secular.

03:16:41.880 --> 03:16:46.840
[Guest]: So they then activate this Hindu anxiety even more and Indira Gandhi, who's a far better

03:16:46.840 --> 03:16:52.040
[Guest]: politician in that sense than Vajpayee, as a mass level, sees this Hindu anxiety.

03:16:52.040 --> 03:16:53.440
[Guest]: She plays to it.

03:16:53.440 --> 03:16:56.800
[Guest]: She goes to temples, she wears saffron saris.

03:16:56.800 --> 03:17:01.080
[Guest]: In the, I think 1982 or 83, there are elections in Jammu and Kashmir.

03:17:01.080 --> 03:17:06.840
[Guest]: And as your listeners know, Jammu has a lot of Hindus and the valley is exclusively Muslim.

03:17:06.840 --> 03:17:10.800
[Guest]: So she campaigns for the Hindu votes in the, and I mean Indira Gandhi, campaigns for the

03:17:10.800 --> 03:17:16.360
[Guest]: Hindu vote in Jammu in that election, using the bogey of national conference, Farooq Abdullah

03:17:16.360 --> 03:17:19.600
[Guest]: and the valley's Muslims, right?

03:17:19.600 --> 03:17:25.240
[Guest]: And she portrays herself as, you know, goddess Durga committed to keeping India united against

03:17:25.240 --> 03:17:29.840
[Guest]: the Khalistan movement and even gives her life for the movement, the RSS notices.

03:17:29.840 --> 03:17:35.320
[Guest]: And so in the 1984 elections held immediately after Indira Gandhi's murder, the RSS actually

03:17:35.320 --> 03:17:42.480
[Guest]: campaigns and votes for Rajiv Gandhi because, and I quote an RSS essay in their mouthpiece

03:17:42.480 --> 03:17:47.000
[Guest]: organizer just after the election saying that, look, Rajiv won because he was the Hindu party

03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:50.120
[Guest]: and Vajpayee lost because he was not the Hindu party.

03:17:50.120 --> 03:17:54.680
[Guest]: And that begins Vajpayee's long exile from the BJP beginning in 1986, all the way to

03:17:54.680 --> 03:17:55.680
[Guest]: 1995.

03:17:55.680 --> 03:18:00.880
[Guest]: So to answer your question, I think Vajpayee's analysis of where India was heading in the

03:18:00.880 --> 03:18:03.120
[Guest]: 1970s was right.

03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:05.760
[Guest]: Someone like Balraj Madhok was wrong in this regard.

03:18:05.760 --> 03:18:10.480
[Guest]: I don't think the Jansangh would have survived in the seventies by being the party of capitalism,

03:18:10.480 --> 03:18:12.840
[Guest]: much as many of your listeners would have preferred that.

03:18:12.840 --> 03:18:16.320
[Guest]: I just don't think the political mood was, was for that.

03:18:16.320 --> 03:18:20.120
[Guest]: And the eighties on the other hand, Vajpayee read it completely wrong and Advani read it

03:18:20.120 --> 03:18:23.120
[Guest]: better because he had his ear closer to the card.

03:18:23.120 --> 03:18:27.720
[Guest]: So Advani, I show him, you know, facing the biggest test of loyalty in his life because

03:18:27.720 --> 03:18:33.220
[Guest]: he doesn't want to reject Vajpayee the person, but he has to reject Vajpayee the ideology

03:18:33.220 --> 03:18:34.480
[Guest]: and he does it.

03:18:34.480 --> 03:18:38.840
[Guest]: And what is remarkable about the BJP is that this happens without a split to the party

03:18:38.840 --> 03:18:42.720
[Guest]: in any other party, Amit, this would have resulted in a split.

03:18:42.720 --> 03:18:48.000
[Amit Varma]: No, and I was struck by, you know, the words of the RSS where they called the 1984 elections

03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:54.340
[Amit Varma]: as a quote, massive Hindu mandate, end quote for Rajiv Gandhi, which is very telling.

03:18:54.340 --> 03:18:59.440
[Amit Varma]: And you talk about how that big growing Hindu vote bank between 1980 and 1984 just goes

03:18:59.440 --> 03:19:00.440
[Amit Varma]: for the Congress.

03:19:00.440 --> 03:19:07.080
[Amit Varma]: And, and you sort of point out another very sort of interesting meeting after that, where,

03:19:07.080 --> 03:19:09.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, the RSS is trying to figure out what do we do?

03:19:09.320 --> 03:19:12.600
[Amit Varma]: And obviously the BJP needs a new leader and all of that.

03:19:12.600 --> 03:19:17.800
[Amit Varma]: And they have, of course, revived the Vishwa Hindu Parishad as a sort of, you know, a counterpoint

03:19:17.800 --> 03:19:20.640
[Amit Varma]: to take the, you know, the hardline view forward.

03:19:20.640 --> 03:19:23.680
[Amit Varma]: But then they decide that Vajpayee has to go and you described this fascinating meeting.

03:19:23.680 --> 03:19:29.080
[Unknown]: I think it's in Gandhinagar, where the young Amit Shah has to, I think, grind paan for

03:19:29.080 --> 03:19:30.080
[Unknown]: Vijay Rajesh.

03:19:30.080 --> 03:19:31.080
[Amit Varma]: Beetle nut.

03:19:31.080 --> 03:19:34.600
[Amit Varma]: He has to grind beetle nut for Vijay Rajesh India, who's sitting in a room with Atal and

03:19:34.600 --> 03:19:40.760
[Amit Varma]: at one point where he's handing over the beetle nut, you know, that this message comes from

03:19:40.760 --> 03:19:44.680
[Amit Varma]: the RSS that Vajpayee has to step down and Vijay Rajesh has to take over.

03:19:44.680 --> 03:19:46.880
[Amit Varma]: And Vijay Rajesh, again, a very interesting figure.

03:19:46.880 --> 03:19:52.320
[Amit Varma]: I was, I wish you'd written more about her where she just doesn't want power.

03:19:52.320 --> 03:19:56.640
[Amit Varma]: She's an incredible patron, practically funds a party single-handedly for a long time, but

03:19:56.640 --> 03:20:00.720
[Amit Varma]: just doesn't want the spoils of power and she doesn't want to hurt Vajpayee.

03:20:00.720 --> 03:20:03.720
[Amit Varma]: So eventually she doesn't take it and it goes to Advani.

03:20:03.720 --> 03:20:07.740
[Amit Varma]: Now, tell me a little bit about how that shift happens.

03:20:07.740 --> 03:20:10.960
[Amit Varma]: Does it affect the personal relationship between the two men?

03:20:10.960 --> 03:20:14.800
[Amit Varma]: Does Vajpayee completely withdraw or is he a humble party servant?

03:20:14.800 --> 03:20:21.020
[Amit Varma]: And what's happening in the next few years as far as the Hindu vote is concerned?

03:20:21.020 --> 03:20:25.680
[Amit Varma]: Because those are tumultuous years for Indian politics, say, you know, leading to VP Singh

03:20:25.680 --> 03:20:26.680
[Amit Varma]: coming to power.

03:20:26.680 --> 03:20:30.160
[Amit Varma]: And of course, we'll, you know, discuss that phase in Ayodhya right after this.

03:20:30.160 --> 03:20:34.060
[Amit Varma]: But in that period, the second half of the 80s, what's the dynamic there?

03:20:34.060 --> 03:20:35.060
[Amit Varma]: What is going on?

03:20:35.060 --> 03:20:37.920
[Amit Varma]: Ramayana and Mahabharata also become really popular at that time.

03:20:37.920 --> 03:20:41.280
[Amit Varma]: Give me a sort of a picture of what the party is going through in that period.

03:20:41.280 --> 03:20:47.440
[Guest]: Well, I mean, for those of your listeners who are strong critics of the BJP and who

03:20:47.440 --> 03:20:52.480
[Guest]: are supporters of the Congress, or rather who see the Congress party as the only quote

03:20:52.480 --> 03:20:59.640
[Guest]: unquote secular possible opposition to the BJP, if you're that kind of person, I think

03:20:59.640 --> 03:21:03.520
[Guest]: you would agree with me that Rajiv Gandhi was absolutely the worst thing that should

03:21:03.520 --> 03:21:05.800
[Guest]: have happened during that period.

03:21:05.800 --> 03:21:11.160
[Guest]: Because and here's a tragedy, you know, he came across as Mr. Clean, the kind of euphoria

03:21:11.160 --> 03:21:16.240
[Guest]: that greets Rajiv Gandhi when he becomes prime minister in late 1984, you know, he's seen

03:21:16.240 --> 03:21:21.320
[Guest]: as it's very similar to, you know, the John F. Kennedy mania in the United States of the

03:21:21.320 --> 03:21:22.320
[Guest]: 1960s.

03:21:22.320 --> 03:21:23.320
[Guest]: He could do no wrong.

03:21:23.320 --> 03:21:28.160
[Guest]: He, you know, he's a modernizer, unlike his brother, younger brother, Sanjay, he kept

03:21:28.160 --> 03:21:29.400
[Guest]: away from politics.

03:21:29.400 --> 03:21:31.120
[Guest]: So he was seen as clean.

03:21:31.120 --> 03:21:32.600
[Guest]: He was seen as a reluctant man.

03:21:32.600 --> 03:21:37.600
[Guest]: A lot of the people who surrounded him were, you know, people from school who had private

03:21:37.600 --> 03:21:39.100
[Guest]: sector education.

03:21:39.100 --> 03:21:42.840
[Guest]: So there was a thrill that went in India, especially the middle class, that he was the

03:21:42.840 --> 03:21:44.680
[Guest]: right man at the right time.

03:21:44.680 --> 03:21:47.640
[Guest]: He actually turned out to be the wrong man in the wrong time because his extraordinary

03:21:47.640 --> 03:21:53.000
[Guest]: inexperience meant that his counter to this Hindu anxiety was to pander it.

03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:58.160
[Guest]: It wasn't to tamp it down the way Mahatma Gandhi had done, which is you see Hindu anxiety

03:21:58.160 --> 03:22:01.520
[Guest]: in the 20s and the 40s, but you actually, that's the leader, right?

03:22:01.520 --> 03:22:03.960
[Guest]: You see anxiety and you calm your people down.

03:22:03.960 --> 03:22:05.360
[Guest]: He exaggerates it.

03:22:05.360 --> 03:22:10.660
[Guest]: So he opens the locks for Babri Masjid for prayer in 1986, I think.

03:22:10.660 --> 03:22:18.000
[Guest]: And then in 1989, he, I think 1985 or 1986 for prayer.

03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:24.160
[Guest]: And in 1989, he opens, he allows Shilanyas or bricklaying ceremony in Ayodhya.

03:22:24.160 --> 03:22:29.240
[Guest]: And it's not a coincidence, Amit, that recently after the new temple was inaugurated in Ayodhya,

03:22:29.240 --> 03:22:33.160
[Guest]: I think it was the Madhya Pradesh Congress, which ran an advertisement saying that actually

03:22:33.160 --> 03:22:34.900
[Guest]: it was Rajiv Gandhi who did it.

03:22:34.900 --> 03:22:39.600
[Guest]: So if you buy the rhetoric that the BJP is a communal party, Rajiv Gandhi got there first,

03:22:39.600 --> 03:22:40.600
[Guest]: you know.

03:22:40.600 --> 03:22:46.600
[Guest]: And then he sort of, he did a jugalbandi of this, you know, Hindu communalism with Muslim

03:22:46.600 --> 03:22:47.600
[Guest]: communalism.

03:22:47.600 --> 03:22:52.720
[Guest]: He was, India, I think was the first country under Rajiv Gandhi to ban the satanic verses.

03:22:52.720 --> 03:22:58.640
[Guest]: He annulls the Supreme Court judgment when it comes to Shabanu by passing a law and,

03:22:58.640 --> 03:23:02.820
[Guest]: you know, which did the exact opposite of protecting Muslim women.

03:23:02.820 --> 03:23:10.520
[Guest]: So here was a man who sees these various Hindu and Muslim anxieties not of his making, responds

03:23:10.520 --> 03:23:15.520
[Guest]: not with high-minded liberalism, but pandering of the worst kind, you know, absolutely worst

03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:16.520
[Guest]: kind.

03:23:16.520 --> 03:23:22.280
[Guest]: And that is the box or the hole that the new party president, Lal Krishna Advani finds

03:23:22.280 --> 03:23:27.620
[Guest]: himself in, in 1986, that you have Hindu anxiety, but actually that Hindu anxiety is being sought

03:23:27.620 --> 03:23:30.480
[Guest]: to be monopolized by the Congress party.

03:23:30.480 --> 03:23:35.640
[Guest]: And if he doesn't move to the right of the Congress party, you know, he risks a repetition

03:23:35.640 --> 03:23:42.240
[Guest]: of the 1984 results where the Congress gets all the Hindu votes and that, it is this kind

03:23:42.240 --> 03:23:49.280
[Guest]: of context, Amit, in which the Lal Krishna Advani finally accepts the Ayodhya movement.

03:23:49.280 --> 03:23:54.480
[Guest]: The Ayodhya movement began by the RSS, BHP and I hope your listeners are listening to

03:23:54.480 --> 03:24:01.200
[Guest]: this two congressmen on stage in 1983 for the Ayodhya movement and very soon Rajiv Gandhi

03:24:01.200 --> 03:24:02.200
[Guest]: adopts it.

03:24:02.200 --> 03:24:07.080
[Guest]: It takes to 1989 for the BJP to adopt it under Lal Krishna Advani.

03:24:07.080 --> 03:24:11.360
[Guest]: And as I point out, you know, he gets on the Rath Yatra, it's an opportunistic reaction

03:24:11.360 --> 03:24:16.400
[Guest]: to the Mandal commission recommendations being implemented.

03:24:16.400 --> 03:24:22.800
[Guest]: And in many ways, the book argues that Advani's about right turn was actually a signal to

03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:28.240
[Guest]: his own cadre and his own movement that the BJP doesn't want to get left behind.

03:24:28.240 --> 03:24:32.680
[Guest]: And all through this period, Vajpayee feels that what Advani is doing is wrong.

03:24:32.680 --> 03:24:35.560
[Guest]: He feels that religion and politics shouldn't mix.

03:24:35.560 --> 03:24:39.800
[Guest]: And Amit, you had asked me this question earlier that, you know, which is the real Vajpayee?

03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:42.560
[Guest]: Is he, you know, is he the liberal or is he really wearing a mask?

03:24:42.560 --> 03:24:46.760
[Guest]: It's hard to say because at that time, his anger is quite genuine.

03:24:46.760 --> 03:24:49.640
[Guest]: He feels this is absolutely the wrong way to go.

03:24:49.640 --> 03:24:53.600
[Guest]: And in fact, he tells Advani that the problem with riding a tiger is that you can never

03:24:53.600 --> 03:24:54.680
[Guest]: get off.

03:24:54.680 --> 03:24:57.040
[Guest]: And I think he genuinely believes that.

03:24:57.040 --> 03:25:01.800
[Guest]: At the same time, I think Vajpayee is being ignored by the party.

03:25:01.800 --> 03:25:06.200
[Guest]: He travels on his own quite a bit in India, but most of the time he's spending time in

03:25:06.200 --> 03:25:12.760
[Guest]: the US with his, you know, or he's in his house in Delhi and he has a little bit of

03:25:12.760 --> 03:25:16.160
[Guest]: Kothari and they're eating, as I point out in the book, prawn curry, a little bit of

03:25:16.160 --> 03:25:17.160
[Guest]: whiskey.

03:25:17.160 --> 03:25:21.000
[Guest]: Vajpayee loved opium or Bhang pakodas.

03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:23.560
[Guest]: And you know, so this is the loser's quote.

03:25:23.560 --> 03:25:27.520
[Guest]: So Vajpayee is being sidelined and these are the people around him.

03:25:27.520 --> 03:25:29.760
[Guest]: People like Rajesh Mishra, Jaswant Singh.

03:25:29.760 --> 03:25:35.000
[Guest]: And the thing is that once Vajpayee comes to power in 96 and then 98, he doesn't forget

03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:38.520
[Guest]: these people because they stood with him when nobody else was standing.

03:25:38.520 --> 03:25:43.880
[Guest]: Now Advani is not invited to these sorries because he doesn't drink, he doesn't eat meat

03:25:43.880 --> 03:25:45.320
[Guest]: and he doesn't, you know, he doesn't gossip.

03:25:45.320 --> 03:25:47.000
[Guest]: He doesn't do that kind of thing.

03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:51.360
[Guest]: On the other hand, relations between the two, I think both make a huge effort to keep it

03:25:51.360 --> 03:25:52.360
[Guest]: going.

03:25:52.360 --> 03:25:54.640
[Guest]: So from Advani's side, I think it's loyalty.

03:25:54.640 --> 03:25:58.840
[Guest]: From Vajpayee's side, it's a recognition that his sidelining in the party is not because

03:25:58.840 --> 03:25:59.840
[Guest]: of Advani.

03:25:59.840 --> 03:26:02.680
[Guest]: It's because the party itself is going in a different direction.

03:26:02.680 --> 03:26:07.560
[Guest]: And Advani is his one insurance, then when things change, then Vajpayee is back in business.

03:26:07.560 --> 03:26:10.160
[Guest]: I also think, you know, I don't want to portray Vajpayee as too cynical.

03:26:10.160 --> 03:26:11.960
[Guest]: I also think he liked Advani.

03:26:11.960 --> 03:26:17.200
[Guest]: So while the professional relationship between them is ruptured, the personal relationship

03:26:17.200 --> 03:26:19.400
[Guest]: somehow manages during this period.

03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:26.240
[Amit Varma]: No, and I can't underscore the point you made earlier about the Congress's alleged secularism,

03:26:26.240 --> 03:26:29.960
[Amit Varma]: which you know, the BJP themselves used to use the term pseudo secularism, which was

03:26:29.960 --> 03:26:33.680
[Amit Varma]: very interesting because if you're against pseudo secularism, one would assume you're

03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:36.920
[Amit Varma]: against a pseudo part of it and therefore you don't mind secularism.

03:26:36.920 --> 03:26:39.800
[Amit Varma]: But they were against both pseudo secularism and secularism.

03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:42.960
[Amit Varma]: But you know, the point to underscore and what I feel strongly about is that the Congress

03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:45.880
[Amit Varma]: today on the ground is the party of Kamal Nath.

03:26:45.880 --> 03:26:49.400
[Amit Varma]: To call it a non-communal party is just a joke.

03:26:49.400 --> 03:26:54.240
[Amit Varma]: They've always been quoting the Hindu vote, which they continue to do today.

03:26:54.240 --> 03:26:59.280
[Amit Varma]: And for all of Rahul Gandhi's woke posturing on Twitter, the bottom line is that he has

03:26:59.280 --> 03:27:04.400
[Amit Varma]: never actually come to, you know, spoken about the horrors of the past or, you know, tried

03:27:04.400 --> 03:27:08.200
[Amit Varma]: to come to terms with them, not just what his father did, but also what his grandmother

03:27:08.200 --> 03:27:09.200
[Amit Varma]: Indira Gandhi did.

03:27:09.200 --> 03:27:13.080
[Amit Varma]: And I think for everything wrong that Modi has done, and he's a horrendous, horrendous

03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:16.440
[Amit Varma]: prime minister, and this is just my opinion, of course, I think Indira was worse.

03:27:16.440 --> 03:27:21.320
[Amit Varma]: Indira was just a moral monster for the kind of things that she did, which is why it's

03:27:21.320 --> 03:27:25.800
[Amit Varma]: difficult to take the Congress party seriously, as long as they have portraits of Indira Gandhi

03:27:25.800 --> 03:27:26.800
[Amit Varma]: on the wall.

03:27:26.800 --> 03:27:27.800
[Guest]: But that sort of...

03:27:27.800 --> 03:27:30.440
[Guest]: Can I interrupt you, if you don't mind?

03:27:30.440 --> 03:27:31.440
[Guest]: Sure.

03:27:31.440 --> 03:27:33.720
[Guest]: Look, I'm just being descriptive, right?

03:27:33.720 --> 03:27:34.720
[Amit Varma]: I know.

03:27:34.720 --> 03:27:38.840
[Guest]: So because I have views, I have pretty strong views and, you know, if you read my book,

03:27:38.840 --> 03:27:42.520
[Guest]: I mean, you know, I think you know that we agree on many things more than we disagree,

03:27:42.520 --> 03:27:43.960
[Guest]: but that's not the point here.

03:27:43.960 --> 03:27:50.640
[Guest]: I'm much more sympathetic about Indira Gandhi as a stunningly good politician.

03:27:50.640 --> 03:27:55.080
[Guest]: Whatever else you can say about her moral feelings, she was a very good politician.

03:27:55.080 --> 03:27:58.120
[Guest]: Her son was a bumbling politician.

03:27:58.120 --> 03:27:59.120
[Guest]: His sin is incompetence.

03:27:59.120 --> 03:28:03.520
[Guest]: It was, you know, he was a pilot who didn't have a heart in this and, you know, and he

03:28:03.520 --> 03:28:07.960
[Guest]: was confronting India, these massive crises in India, and he was just clueless despite

03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:09.360
[Guest]: having this mandate.

03:28:09.360 --> 03:28:11.400
[Guest]: I think that's a much worse sin, right?

03:28:11.400 --> 03:28:14.840
[Guest]: Or whatever, I leave your listeners to ask that question.

03:28:14.840 --> 03:28:20.320
[Guest]: And in that, I think Rahul Gandhi, you know, reminds me a lot more of his father rather

03:28:20.320 --> 03:28:24.320
[Guest]: than his grandmother, because, you know, from all accounts, he's a, you know, personally

03:28:24.320 --> 03:28:25.320
[Guest]: polite person.

03:28:25.320 --> 03:28:26.320
[Guest]: He's personally charming.

03:28:26.320 --> 03:28:30.920
[Guest]: You know, he's well brought up, but he's just, you know, for the kind of changes that is

03:28:30.920 --> 03:28:35.600
[Guest]: going on in India, he could not be, you know, worse place to deal with.

03:28:35.600 --> 03:28:38.800
[Guest]: And that definitely reminds me of Rajiv Gandhi during that period.

03:28:38.800 --> 03:28:44.240
[Amit Varma]: No, the reason I partly called Indira Gandhi a moral monster is includes what you just

03:28:44.240 --> 03:28:48.400
[Amit Varma]: said about her incredible politics, because she was such an incredible politician.

03:28:48.400 --> 03:28:53.760
[Amit Varma]: She took decisions and took the country in directions, which were going to be disastrous

03:28:53.760 --> 03:28:57.200
[Amit Varma]: for the people and were horrible in terms of governance, and she didn't give a damn

03:28:57.200 --> 03:28:58.200
[Amit Varma]: about that.

03:28:58.200 --> 03:28:59.200
[Amit Varma]: That wasn't even a factor.

03:28:59.200 --> 03:29:03.960
[Amit Varma]: Her only factor, much as in fact, it is for the current dispensation, is that how do I

03:29:03.960 --> 03:29:10.280
[Amit Varma]: craft the narrative to win elections, governance, you know, and in that sense, when, you know,

03:29:10.280 --> 03:29:14.200
[Amit Varma]: Narendra Modi did demonetization, which I call the largest assault on property rights

03:29:14.200 --> 03:29:15.200
[Amit Varma]: in human history.

03:29:15.200 --> 03:29:19.320
[Amit Varma]: The moment I heard about that measure, I thought, oh, this is, you know, just the kind of thing

03:29:19.320 --> 03:29:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Indira Gandhi would do, you know, just thinking of narrative and not giving a damn about what

03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:25.520
[Amit Varma]: actually happens on the ground.

03:29:25.520 --> 03:29:29.480
[Amit Varma]: But that aside, and I must point out to my listeners that this is me giving my opinion.

03:29:29.480 --> 03:29:32.360
[Amit Varma]: And you know, none of this is in the book.

03:29:32.360 --> 03:29:33.360
[Amit Varma]: None of this is in the book.

03:29:33.360 --> 03:29:34.640
[Amit Varma]: This is just me giving my opinion.

03:29:34.640 --> 03:29:39.720
[Amit Varma]: Vinay's book is only about facts and in that sense is incredibly rigorous.

03:29:39.720 --> 03:29:44.880
[Amit Varma]: Now, let's talk about that period after Rajiv Gandhi comes out of power.

03:29:44.880 --> 03:29:49.800
[Amit Varma]: Now, we already spoke earlier in the episode about what is happening when, you know, V.P.

03:29:49.800 --> 03:29:50.800
[Amit Varma]: Singh is in power.

03:29:50.800 --> 03:29:52.320
[Amit Varma]: Devi Lal is doing his little thing there.

03:29:52.320 --> 03:29:53.320
[Amit Varma]: V.P.

03:29:53.320 --> 03:29:54.440
[Amit Varma]: Singh feels insecure about that.

03:29:54.440 --> 03:29:55.440
[Amit Varma]: So he does Mandal.

03:29:55.440 --> 03:29:56.440
[Amit Varma]: Now, L.K.

03:29:56.440 --> 03:30:01.000
[Amit Varma]: Advani, who is, you know, in charge of BJP is now in a spot, how do I react to Mandal?

03:30:01.000 --> 03:30:05.240
[Amit Varma]: There are all these pressures and this could divide sort of the Hindu vote.

03:30:05.240 --> 03:30:06.800
[Amit Varma]: But I need to bring it together for me.

03:30:06.800 --> 03:30:07.800
[Amit Varma]: What do I do?

03:30:07.800 --> 03:30:08.800
[Amit Varma]: Oh, there's Ayodhya.

03:30:08.800 --> 03:30:10.600
[Amit Varma]: Let's do a Rath Yatra.

03:30:10.600 --> 03:30:15.120
[Amit Varma]: And you speak about, you know, Atal Bihari, Vajpayee, in fact, you quote him as saying,

03:30:15.120 --> 03:30:19.120
[Amit Varma]: quote, the difficulty of the Rath, once you ride it, you do not feel like getting down

03:30:19.120 --> 03:30:20.120
[Amit Varma]: from it.

03:30:20.120 --> 03:30:21.120
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

03:30:21.120 --> 03:30:22.120
[Amit Varma]: And at another point, he asked L.K.

03:30:22.120 --> 03:30:23.120
[Amit Varma]: Advani that don't do this.

03:30:23.120 --> 03:30:27.600
[Amit Varma]: He says, you know, quote, you're riding a tiger, stop quote, which is really interesting to

03:30:27.600 --> 03:30:28.600
[Amit Varma]: me.

03:30:28.600 --> 03:30:35.480
[Amit Varma]: I want to sort of point out that this changes Advani in a kind of fundamental ways, as I

03:30:35.480 --> 03:30:39.840
[Amit Varma]: think Swapan Dasgupta remarked that the Rath Yatra changes him in fundamental ways, almost

03:30:39.840 --> 03:30:44.880
[Amit Varma]: as if he has taken this direction and the Mukhota becomes a person, so to say, the mask

03:30:44.880 --> 03:30:45.880
[Amit Varma]: becomes a person.

03:30:45.880 --> 03:30:50.920
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about this phase of time leading up to Ayodhya and one of the

03:30:50.920 --> 03:30:54.840
[Amit Varma]: sort of, you know, when you go deep into that, when you go deep into the nuances of what

03:30:54.840 --> 03:31:01.400
[Amit Varma]: actually happened, what strikes me there is that just as in the 1980s, the whole resurgence

03:31:01.400 --> 03:31:06.120
[Amit Varma]: of the Hindu vote was a bottom up thing, which, you know, Vajpayee and Advani were first completely

03:31:06.120 --> 03:31:07.600
[Amit Varma]: taken aback by.

03:31:07.600 --> 03:31:11.640
[Amit Varma]: What is happening now also is that the movement is a bottom up thing.

03:31:11.640 --> 03:31:16.360
[Amit Varma]: And that Vajpayee and even Advani, from what seems to from the narrative, have much less

03:31:16.360 --> 03:31:21.640
[Amit Varma]: control than most people, including Narsimha Rao, appear to think they do.

03:31:21.640 --> 03:31:26.760
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that phase, especially as this episode releases on the 6th of December,

03:31:26.760 --> 03:31:29.440
[Amit Varma]: which is, of course, a, you know, a sort of a historic day.

03:31:29.440 --> 03:31:33.440
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about the lead up to that, because what is really interesting is that you have

03:31:33.440 --> 03:31:40.080
[Amit Varma]: political Hindutva, the supply end of political Hindutva, gathering force at a time when,

03:31:40.080 --> 03:31:43.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, the people at the top aren't really in control of events anymore.

03:31:43.800 --> 03:31:46.160
[Amit Varma]: And there are things happening, which have a momentum of their own.

03:31:46.160 --> 03:31:47.160
[Guest]: Tell me a bit about that.

03:31:47.160 --> 03:31:48.160
[Guest]: I think that's exactly right.

03:31:48.160 --> 03:31:53.680
[Guest]: Because, you know, and it's not like, let's just take a step back, Amit, to focus a little

03:31:53.680 --> 03:31:57.320
[Guest]: bit on the period 1990 to 91.

03:31:57.320 --> 03:32:02.000
[Guest]: There are three different momentums or three different forces in India, which have a momentum

03:32:02.000 --> 03:32:03.320
[Guest]: of their own.

03:32:03.320 --> 03:32:07.400
[Guest]: One is, of course, the OBC reservations in North India, which then culminates in Mandal

03:32:07.400 --> 03:32:08.680
[Guest]: Commission report.

03:32:08.680 --> 03:32:13.080
[Guest]: But Mandal Commission report didn't begin OBC reservations in India, it actually ended

03:32:13.080 --> 03:32:18.880
[Guest]: it because in the 60s itself, in the states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, etc.

03:32:18.880 --> 03:32:22.480
[Guest]: You had OBC reservation and by the 80s, this had entered North India.

03:32:22.480 --> 03:32:27.120
[Guest]: So the OBC reservations and the central level and central government job was the culmination

03:32:27.120 --> 03:32:28.400
[Guest]: of this force.

03:32:28.400 --> 03:32:32.000
[Guest]: The other, of course, is the Rath Yatra or Mandir.

03:32:32.000 --> 03:32:36.040
[Guest]: As I point out, there was a bottom up force that was activated by the RSS and VHP and

03:32:36.040 --> 03:32:40.720
[Guest]: the movement began in 1983 itself, seven years before the Rath Yatra.

03:32:40.720 --> 03:32:47.200
[Guest]: And the third, let's not forget, Amit, was the catastrophic failure of the Indian economy.

03:32:47.200 --> 03:32:51.400
[Guest]: And again, it was not fated that you would end up with liberalization, but something

03:32:51.400 --> 03:32:52.400
[Guest]: had to give.

03:32:52.400 --> 03:32:57.320
[Guest]: So Indira Gandhi herself tried with the LKJ commission report, the Alexander commission

03:32:57.320 --> 03:33:02.800
[Guest]: report on economic changes, Rajiv Gandhi tried a little bit, but it was really left to Narsimha

03:33:02.800 --> 03:33:03.800
[Guest]: Rao to open up.

03:33:03.800 --> 03:33:09.920
[Guest]: Now, the point I make in my book is that all of these three events, which is Mandal, Mandir

03:33:09.920 --> 03:33:12.800
[Guest]: and market, were not inevitable.

03:33:12.800 --> 03:33:18.760
[Guest]: When VP Singh comes to power, yes, there is an OBC reservation, they did talk about it

03:33:18.760 --> 03:33:23.800
[Guest]: in the manifesto itself, but had it not been for Devi Lal's attempt to upstage VP Singh,

03:33:23.800 --> 03:33:26.400
[Guest]: he may never have implemented the Mandal commission report.

03:33:26.400 --> 03:33:29.880
[Guest]: If the government had changed and the Congress come back, they would have never implemented

03:33:29.880 --> 03:33:31.320
[Guest]: it.

03:33:31.320 --> 03:33:35.280
[Guest]: Because the commission report was submitted in 1980 itself and for 10 years, the Congress

03:33:35.280 --> 03:33:37.480
[Guest]: government didn't want to touch it.

03:33:37.480 --> 03:33:42.760
[Guest]: This ditto with Mandir, if it hadn't been for the Mandal commission report, Advani was

03:33:42.760 --> 03:33:47.400
[Guest]: still in his Hamlet-like ability of should I, should I not, he wouldn't have decisively

03:33:47.400 --> 03:33:49.120
[Guest]: got on to the rut.

03:33:49.120 --> 03:33:53.320
[Guest]: And as I argued in my previous book, Half Line, if it wasn't for Narsimha Rao, you may

03:33:53.320 --> 03:33:56.480
[Guest]: not have been so decisive when it came to liberalization.

03:33:56.480 --> 03:34:00.680
[Guest]: And I just want to take your listeners back to a question we had right in the beginning

03:34:00.680 --> 03:34:06.960
[Guest]: of this podcast, which is the role that events and people play alongside structures and larger

03:34:06.960 --> 03:34:07.960
[Guest]: changes.

03:34:07.960 --> 03:34:11.800
[Guest]: And I think Mandal, Mandir and Markit are good examples of that, that yes, there were

03:34:11.800 --> 03:34:14.200
[Guest]: larger forces, but it was not fated.

03:34:14.200 --> 03:34:20.760
[Guest]: And all those three decisions which LK Advani makes on Mandal, Mandir and Markit, which

03:34:20.760 --> 03:34:26.560
[Guest]: is to support OBC reservations, support Mandal, to support Mandir and to support Markit was

03:34:26.560 --> 03:34:27.560
[Guest]: not inevitable.

03:34:27.560 --> 03:34:30.680
[Guest]: And I point out in the book, many pulls and pressures he had.

03:34:30.680 --> 03:34:35.440
[Guest]: And for good or for worse, those three decisions define the party today, which is that BJP

03:34:35.440 --> 03:34:39.960
[Guest]: is known as the pro-Mandir party, it is known also as an OBC party.

03:34:39.960 --> 03:34:45.360
[Guest]: And I know many of your listeners would disagree, but at least it plays a superficial mouth

03:34:45.360 --> 03:34:49.240
[Guest]: value to the benefits of liberalization.

03:34:49.240 --> 03:34:55.120
[Guest]: And that's very important because that 1991 period is a real pivot in Indian history.

03:34:55.120 --> 03:34:56.680
[Guest]: It could have turned out very differently.

03:34:56.680 --> 03:35:01.680
[Guest]: Yes, there were the larger forces, but only looking at a larger forces and saying that

03:35:01.680 --> 03:35:06.640
[Guest]: these were inevitable in India, or to put it differently, looking just as demand side

03:35:06.640 --> 03:35:11.520
[Guest]: explanations to say that supply will soon follow, it need not have turned out that way.

03:35:11.520 --> 03:35:13.880
[Guest]: So in that sense, it's an enormous pivot.

03:35:13.880 --> 03:35:17.760
[Guest]: And I want to end with the question you asked, because today, your listeners are hearing

03:35:17.760 --> 03:35:20.640
[Guest]: it on December 6, 2020.

03:35:20.640 --> 03:35:25.040
[Guest]: And on December 6, 1992, there was a very different event in India, which is the demolition

03:35:25.040 --> 03:35:26.040
[Guest]: of the Babri Masjid.

03:35:26.040 --> 03:35:30.720
[Guest]: And Amit, I got to tell you that the Babri Masjid haunts me in many ways.

03:35:30.720 --> 03:35:35.000
[Guest]: So as I told you, right in the beginning of the podcast, I remember the Bombay riots,

03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:40.520
[Guest]: I remember seeing the timber yards on the other side of Mahim Bay burning from the terrace

03:35:40.520 --> 03:35:41.920
[Guest]: of my building.

03:35:41.920 --> 03:35:45.760
[Guest]: But also in my Narsimha Rao book, I devoted a whole chapter to it.

03:35:45.760 --> 03:35:50.320
[Guest]: And once again, in this book, I devote an entire chapter to Babri Masjid.

03:35:50.320 --> 03:35:54.600
[Guest]: And broadly, you know, so I think I've done more research on the subject and talk to more

03:35:54.600 --> 03:35:57.960
[Guest]: people than most, I would say with some confidence.

03:35:57.960 --> 03:36:00.920
[Guest]: And you know, I don't want to reveal more to your listener, because you know, she and

03:36:00.920 --> 03:36:02.580
[Guest]: he should read it.

03:36:02.580 --> 03:36:08.720
[Guest]: But in short, I'm more convinced that things went out of control, rather than a well planned

03:36:08.720 --> 03:36:10.280
[Guest]: conspiracy from the top.

03:36:10.280 --> 03:36:11.320
[Guest]: There was a conspiracy.

03:36:11.320 --> 03:36:15.160
[Guest]: The question is, was the top leadership of the BJP involved?

03:36:15.160 --> 03:36:19.240
[Guest]: You would never know, because there's a lot of smokes and mirrors happening here.

03:36:19.240 --> 03:36:23.000
[Guest]: The trial court has actually exonerated everybody saying there's no conspiracy.

03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:24.440
[Guest]: I don't agree with that.

03:36:24.440 --> 03:36:32.420
[Guest]: But it seems certainly plausible that someone like Advani and Vajpayee were blindsided by

03:36:32.420 --> 03:36:38.200
[Guest]: things getting out of hand, rather than, you know, well planned conspiracy from the top.

03:36:38.200 --> 03:36:42.160
[Amit Varma]: In fact, one of the sort of memorable sentences from your book and earlier, you claim that

03:36:42.160 --> 03:36:44.360
[Amit Varma]: you are not into good sentences and all of that.

03:36:44.360 --> 03:36:46.120
[Amit Varma]: And that's completely untrue.

03:36:46.120 --> 03:36:50.320
[Amit Varma]: And one of my favorite sentences from the book is when you're describing Advani and

03:36:50.320 --> 03:36:54.720
[Amit Varma]: Joshi at the site where, you know, things are going out of their hand and you write

03:36:54.720 --> 03:37:00.300
[Amit Varma]: quote, they look like prisoners rather than wardens, stop quote, which to me, like sums

03:37:00.300 --> 03:37:04.860
[Amit Varma]: up so much not just about that event, but possibly a lot more than that.

03:37:04.860 --> 03:37:08.800
[Amit Varma]: And then you also write about how, you know, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, of course, chose not

03:37:08.800 --> 03:37:12.760
[Amit Varma]: to go to Ayodhya and was apprehensive about what would happen there.

03:37:12.760 --> 03:37:14.000
[Amit Varma]: And he's in Delhi.

03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:19.360
[Amit Varma]: And you know, when the demolition starts, N M Khatate, his old friend goes to meet him.

03:37:19.360 --> 03:37:23.560
[Amit Varma]: And you quote Khatate as saying quote, he was all alone watching TV.

03:37:23.560 --> 03:37:25.000
[Amit Varma]: He was very, very angry.

03:37:25.000 --> 03:37:28.600
[Amit Varma]: He could not believe what had happened, stop quote.

03:37:28.600 --> 03:37:33.120
[Amit Varma]: And there's sort of, and that's just a very interesting dynamic, you know, we don't have

03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:34.120
[Amit Varma]: much time.

03:37:34.120 --> 03:37:36.520
[Amit Varma]: So I want to get to sort of closing question in a sense.

03:37:36.520 --> 03:37:42.200
[Amit Varma]: But again, I would say that I have barely touched upon sort of the depth and nuance

03:37:42.200 --> 03:37:43.200
[Amit Varma]: that is in your book.

03:37:43.200 --> 03:37:48.280
[Amit Varma]: So you know, even the period after this through the 90s, Vajpayee becoming Prime Minister,

03:37:48.280 --> 03:37:53.360
[Amit Varma]: the sort of the two short terms, and then that one longish term, and then Modi and Shah

03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:55.400
[Amit Varma]: coming back, all of it is fascinating.

03:37:55.400 --> 03:37:59.760
[Amit Varma]: And it's like a thriller unfolding in front of you and an ongoing thriller as it were.

03:37:59.760 --> 03:38:03.280
[Amit Varma]: So it's impossible to kind of put it down.

03:38:03.280 --> 03:38:09.880
[Amit Varma]: I want to sort of end with something that you said in a recent interview for Scroll

03:38:09.880 --> 03:38:18.240
[Amit Varma]: with Rohan Venkat, where in response to something that he said, you spoke about how quote, a

03:38:18.240 --> 03:38:23.120
[Amit Varma]: Hindu group consciousness that you are Hindu, I am Hindu, let's vote for the same party

03:38:23.120 --> 03:38:24.640
[Amit Varma]: that has to be constructed.

03:38:24.640 --> 03:38:28.600
[Amit Varma]: That's a hundred year project of Hindu nationalism, which is why when you look at the wording

03:38:28.600 --> 03:38:33.120
[Amit Varma]: of Hindu nationalism is politically liberal in that it is premised on the idea of one

03:38:33.120 --> 03:38:35.000
[Amit Varma]: person, one vote, stop quote.

03:38:35.000 --> 03:38:39.080
[Amit Varma]: Now, you've spoken about the Hindu group consciousness, you are Hindu, I am Hindu, let's vote for

03:38:39.080 --> 03:38:40.080
[Amit Varma]: the same party.

03:38:40.080 --> 03:38:44.840
[Amit Varma]: Now, obviously, people contain multitudes, which has become a cliche on my show.

03:38:44.840 --> 03:38:50.720
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, and it might be the case that, let us say that I am a Hindu, and you can

03:38:50.720 --> 03:38:55.440
[Amit Varma]: appeal to that part of me, when you're trying to build this Hindu group consciousness.

03:38:55.440 --> 03:39:01.320
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, what canny politicians would always look out for is that other other parts

03:39:01.320 --> 03:39:06.920
[Amit Varma]: of people's personality, which we can appeal to, which they can care about enough to vote

03:39:06.920 --> 03:39:09.880
[Amit Varma]: for it, that don't go down this axis.

03:39:09.880 --> 03:39:16.960
[Amit Varma]: So for example, a lot of the ideas of Congress are just abstract ideas and often insincerely

03:39:16.960 --> 03:39:22.560
[Amit Varma]: expressed by them to begin with, like concepts of secularism or all the abstract ideas of

03:39:22.560 --> 03:39:24.000
[Amit Varma]: India that come about.

03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:28.680
[Amit Varma]: And I would argue that in our lived reality as well, besides a Hindu consciousness, there

03:39:28.680 --> 03:39:34.320
[Amit Varma]: is also a sort of, there is something syncretic to it, there is something, you know, while

03:39:34.320 --> 03:39:38.040
[Amit Varma]: our society in many ways is deeply liberal, there are many ways in which it is deeply

03:39:38.040 --> 03:39:43.440
[Amit Varma]: liberal in the way that we embrace influences from everywhere and make this delightful khichdi,

03:39:43.440 --> 03:39:47.760
[Amit Varma]: like Vajpayee himself in his own personality, if not in his politics.

03:39:47.760 --> 03:39:54.720
[Amit Varma]: So my sort of rambling question to you right at the end is that, you know, in all your

03:39:54.720 --> 03:40:00.280
[Amit Varma]: studies of sort of political theory, not just in India and elsewhere, is it something that

03:40:00.280 --> 03:40:05.240
[Amit Varma]: would give you the sense that assuming that this Hindu consciousness has been captured

03:40:05.240 --> 03:40:10.760
[Amit Varma]: by this one party at the center, and it's done for, and it would appear that even other

03:40:10.760 --> 03:40:15.440
[Amit Varma]: parties like the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress are very cognizant of it.

03:40:15.440 --> 03:40:20.400
[Amit Varma]: And they work within the bounds of, you know, they don't want to displease this Hindu consciousness,

03:40:20.400 --> 03:40:26.120
[Amit Varma]: so to say, you know, are there other aspects to our nature that also unite us, other things

03:40:26.120 --> 03:40:31.920
[Amit Varma]: that we care about, that can in future become a locus of political movements?

03:40:31.920 --> 03:40:36.560
[Guest]: So that's a deep question, I mean, like your other questions, but this is a deep question.

03:40:36.560 --> 03:40:42.160
[Guest]: And let me just rephrase it in my language, which is the following, which is that if you

03:40:42.160 --> 03:40:46.880
[Guest]: just buy this idea that India is a Hindu majority country, and you had this one party that has

03:40:46.880 --> 03:40:51.880
[Guest]: been able to activate Hindu group consciousness, is politics as we know over?

03:40:51.880 --> 03:40:55.760
[Guest]: Because there's no other way in which you can localize, you can kind of find another

03:40:55.760 --> 03:40:57.760
[Guest]: loci of identity.

03:40:57.760 --> 03:41:03.480
[Guest]: So one is that it's true that India is a Hindu majority country, but India is also a peasant

03:41:03.480 --> 03:41:04.480
[Guest]: majority country.

03:41:04.480 --> 03:41:07.880
[Guest]: It's a majority peasant country, it's a majority of workers and peasants.

03:41:07.880 --> 03:41:10.440
[Guest]: Why doesn't the Communist Party come to power?

03:41:10.440 --> 03:41:14.880
[Guest]: India is a majority Bahujan country, you know, non-Apakasa 80%.

03:41:14.880 --> 03:41:16.980
[Guest]: Why didn't Kanchiram come to power?

03:41:16.980 --> 03:41:25.640
[Guest]: So the first answer to your question is that rather than look for other identity access,

03:41:25.640 --> 03:41:28.720
[Guest]: maybe the real answer lies in better organization.

03:41:28.720 --> 03:41:33.200
[Guest]: You know, rather than trying to find a magic that, you know, to counter Hindu group consciousness

03:41:33.200 --> 03:41:38.740
[Guest]: by something else, how about like picking parties which just focus on better organization

03:41:38.740 --> 03:41:42.720
[Guest]: and in that learn something from the BJP, don't split, right?

03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:44.400
[Guest]: Believe in teamwork, right?

03:41:44.400 --> 03:41:48.680
[Guest]: Even when there's disagreement, kind of stick around because things may come your part.

03:41:48.680 --> 03:41:54.040
[Guest]: That's the purpose of this book, that look, the inevitability of the BJP's rise is not

03:41:54.040 --> 03:41:55.040
[Guest]: true.

03:41:55.040 --> 03:41:56.040
[Guest]: There's hard work there.

03:41:56.040 --> 03:41:57.040
[Guest]: There's teamwork there.

03:41:57.040 --> 03:42:01.280
[Guest]: Yes, it's a majoritarian ideology, but there's no shortage of majoritarian ideologies in

03:42:01.280 --> 03:42:02.280
[Guest]: India.

03:42:02.280 --> 03:42:04.360
[Guest]: Why did this particular one win?

03:42:04.360 --> 03:42:07.680
[Guest]: So that's the first sort of answer to the question that you asked.

03:42:07.680 --> 03:42:14.200
[Guest]: The second answer, Amit, is to ask the question that is the only way to defeat the BJP through

03:42:14.200 --> 03:42:19.400
[Guest]: another group identity or is there another way to conceptualize the individual?

03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:25.880
[Guest]: Unfortunately on this question, I'm a pessimist, which is that the beginning of Hindu nationalism

03:42:25.880 --> 03:42:30.960
[Guest]: is the introduction of one person, one vote to a group-based society where Indians think

03:42:30.960 --> 03:42:35.740
[Guest]: in their social and economic lives are entirely in terms of groups.

03:42:35.740 --> 03:42:40.560
[Guest]: What makes Indian politics flexible is that the group definition keeps changing.

03:42:40.560 --> 03:42:44.200
[Guest]: Sometimes you vote on the basis of your region, sometimes your caste, sometimes your religion,

03:42:44.200 --> 03:42:47.280
[Guest]: but you're still voting on the basis of groups.

03:42:47.280 --> 03:42:53.840
[Guest]: Now the question is, will Indians ever start voting on the basis of individual freedom?

03:42:53.840 --> 03:42:54.840
[Guest]: That's really the question.

03:42:54.840 --> 03:42:58.960
[Guest]: And if that happens, that's a genuine counter to the BJP.

03:42:58.960 --> 03:43:02.360
[Guest]: Stop telling me how to celebrate Valentine's Day.

03:43:02.360 --> 03:43:04.400
[Guest]: Stop telling me what to eat in my house.

03:43:04.400 --> 03:43:07.640
[Guest]: These are all based on the idea of individual freedom.

03:43:07.640 --> 03:43:13.840
[Guest]: The reason, Amit, that those critics of the BJP don't have popular purchase, they just

03:43:13.840 --> 03:43:20.320
[Guest]: don't have popular purchase, is in India we yet don't have a constituency which is liberal.

03:43:20.320 --> 03:43:25.120
[Guest]: And I define liberal in the very limited sense of putting individual freedom at the center

03:43:25.120 --> 03:43:26.620
[Guest]: of your politics.

03:43:26.620 --> 03:43:32.960
[Guest]: So that's a pretty pessimistic answer because that is a fundamental counter to the BJP.

03:43:32.960 --> 03:43:38.400
[Guest]: But none of the BJP's opposition parties want to go that path, especially the Congress party.

03:43:38.400 --> 03:43:39.600
[Guest]: That's not what they're into.

03:43:39.600 --> 03:43:43.060
[Guest]: And maybe they're not going down that path because Indians aren't ready for that kind

03:43:43.060 --> 03:43:44.440
[Guest]: of argument.

03:43:44.440 --> 03:43:48.920
[Guest]: So that's, you know, I'm sorry to end this long, long podcast on a slightly pessimistic

03:43:48.920 --> 03:43:49.920
[Guest]: note.

03:43:49.920 --> 03:43:54.040
[Guest]: But, you know, I want to end this by asking what you think, because I think, you know,

03:43:54.040 --> 03:43:58.320
[Guest]: hearing your podcast, this is a question you obsess over again and again and again.

03:43:58.320 --> 03:44:00.080
[Amit Varma]: No, I agree with you entirely.

03:44:00.080 --> 03:44:03.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, my hope would be that a great locus would be individual freedom because we are

03:44:03.920 --> 03:44:05.880
[Amit Varma]: all individuals first.

03:44:05.880 --> 03:44:09.880
[Amit Varma]: And then after that, we construct all these other group identities and whatever around

03:44:09.880 --> 03:44:10.880
[Amit Varma]: us.

03:44:10.880 --> 03:44:13.200
[Amit Varma]: And I do not see it happening.

03:44:13.200 --> 03:44:14.760
[Amit Varma]: And I'm as pessimistic about it.

03:44:14.760 --> 03:44:18.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know, one thing that gives me hope is that look, the future is full of unknown

03:44:18.200 --> 03:44:19.200
[Amit Varma]: unknowns.

03:44:19.200 --> 03:44:24.280
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, one can just hope for things that are currently beyond our conception and

03:44:24.280 --> 03:44:25.800
[Amit Varma]: maybe good things will come out of that.

03:44:25.800 --> 03:44:30.520
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that I do hope for is that the next time we, you know, do an episode

03:44:30.520 --> 03:44:35.280
[Amit Varma]: together, perhaps on your first book on Narasimha Rao, which is as fascinating a subject that

03:44:35.280 --> 03:44:40.200
[Amit Varma]: you'll give me five or six hours because today I really felt like we could have gone on and

03:44:40.200 --> 03:44:41.200
[Amit Varma]: on and on.

03:44:41.200 --> 03:44:47.240
[Amit Varma]: But unfortunately, you know, we are both human and there is only so much time for this.

03:44:47.240 --> 03:44:50.640
[Amit Varma]: But thank you so much for your generosity in sharing your time and your insights.

03:44:50.640 --> 03:44:55.000
[Amit Varma]: I, you know, I'm going to read your book again carefully because there is so much to process

03:44:55.000 --> 03:44:58.080
[Amit Varma]: and I recommend that all my listeners do the same.

03:44:58.080 --> 03:44:59.560
[Guest]: So thanks so much for coming on the show.

03:44:59.560 --> 03:45:00.560
[Guest]: Thanks, Amit.

03:45:00.560 --> 03:45:05.560
[Guest]: And I'm totally sold on to this on what you're doing, because I haven't had this discussion

03:45:05.560 --> 03:45:07.880
[Guest]: with anyone with this kind of depth.

03:45:07.880 --> 03:45:12.120
[Guest]: And I think that, you know, it's the medium and it's you who makes it possible, which

03:45:12.120 --> 03:45:17.360
[Guest]: is if you go back to our original debate about, you know, structure or technology and individuals,

03:45:17.360 --> 03:45:20.080
[Guest]: I think in the case of seen and unseen, it's both here.

03:45:20.080 --> 03:45:21.800
[Amit Varma]: So thank you very much.

03:45:21.800 --> 03:45:25.480
[Amit Varma]: You are the first historian to tell me that the great man of history is true by pointing

03:45:25.480 --> 03:45:26.960
[Guest]: out that the great man is me.

03:45:26.960 --> 03:45:27.960
[Guest]: Thank you so much.

03:45:27.960 --> 03:45:28.960
[Guest]: Thanks.

03:45:28.960 --> 03:45:29.960
[Guest]: Thanks a lot, Amit.

03:45:29.960 --> 03:45:30.960
