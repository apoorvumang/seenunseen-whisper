00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.200
[Amit Varma]: How did we get to episode 300? When I began the scene in the unseen almost 6 years ago,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.280
[Amit Varma]: it was an experiment. I didn't understand podcasting and this show was so different

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.480
[Amit Varma]: then. But I kept myself open to learning and realised that all my priors about this medium

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.240
[Amit Varma]: were wrong. I did not have to cater to short attention spans. People want depth, they want

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.720
[Amit Varma]: nuance, they want serious discussion that is not about scoring points or gotcha moments.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.080
[Amit Varma]: And they are interested in human beings as much as ideas. Over this time, the show has

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.160
[Amit Varma]: evolved from 20 minute glimpses of public policy to 2 hour deep dives into subjects

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.160
[Amit Varma]: to 5 hour conversations that are akin to oral history. And the deeper my dives, the deeper

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.340
[Amit Varma]: your engagement. So I want to thank all of you for the love you've given me which keeps

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.880
[Amit Varma]: me going. This is not just a matter of great numbers. This show is kept alive and financially

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.200
[Amit Varma]: viable by the contributions of listeners. To bring up an old trope of mine, your love

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.320
[Amit Varma]: ain't just some abstract thing. It's concrete and I feel it every day. So thank you again.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, I celebrated episode 200 with a mega conversation curated by Shruti Rajgopalan,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.680
[Amit Varma]: in which a whole bunch of my guests asked me questions. For episode 300, I've decided

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.280
[Amit Varma]: not to do something so elaborate, but just get a special guest. That's what I've done.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.880
[Unknown]: And we had a special conversation. Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:35.640
[Unknown]: podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science. Please welcome your host, Amit Varma.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.840
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is Pratap Bhanu Mehta. And I was almost

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.640
[Amit Varma]: tempted not to record the intro for this episode because Pratap needs no introduction. Pratap

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.880
[Amit Varma]: is one of my intellectual heroes, and I've learned a lot from him over the years, not

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.500
[Amit Varma]: just from his writing, but his way of thinking about a subject. All of us, we dig deep as

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.760
[Amit Varma]: far as our capacity allows, and then we stop. And the narratives we have are the narratives

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.600
[Amit Varma]: we have. But Pratap digs deeper into whatever subject he cares about and keeps himself open

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.600
[Amit Varma]: more than anyone else I know. Whenever I read him or interact with him, I feel like I need

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.280
[Amit Varma]: to step back and learn that all my reading so far is inadequate. He was my guest in episode

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.200
[Amit Varma]: 186 of the show, and many people still refer to that as their favorite episode. Do listen

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.960
[Amit Varma]: to that if you haven't already. These two are like companion conversations in a sense.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.160
[Amit Varma]: Now, that earlier episode was recorded remotely. And oddly enough, we hadn't met in person

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.800
[Amit Varma]: until I went to Delhi this August and invited him for this chat. We spoke about the world

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.840
[Amit Varma]: and the self, about the personal and the political, about how the shape of the world is shifting,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.440
[Amit Varma]: and how we can try to make sense of it. There is more insight per minute in this conversation

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.560
[Amit Varma]: than in perhaps any episode I've recorded. And in it, you'll also hear him mention the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.200
[Amit Varma]: great Dalit scholar Chandrabhan Prasad. And when I told him, hey, I invited Chandrabhan

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.760
[Amit Varma]: ji to the show and he declined, Pratap said, don't worry, I'll make it happen. And he did.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.640
[Amit Varma]: And that episode actually released before this one three weeks ago. That's just one

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.840
[Amit Varma]: instance of the kindness I refer to. Anyway, check out this conversation. I loved it so

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.920
[Amit Varma]: much. But first, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.680
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.280
[Amit Varma]: habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.320
[Amit Varma]: essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.160
[Amit Varma]: face is how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.960
[Amit Varma]: the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends of mine run this

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.520
[Amit Varma]: awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims to help people up level themselves

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.960
[Amit Varma]: by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called the Daily

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.140
[Amit Varma]: Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read. The subjects

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.120
[Amit Varma]: covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade. This helped

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.160
[Amit Varma]: me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world a little

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.000
[Amit Varma]: better than I did before. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.280
[Amit Varma]: CTQ Compounds and check out their Daily Reader. New batches start every month. They also have

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.680
[Amit Varma]: a great program called FutureStack, which helps you stay up to date with ideas, skills

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.440
[Amit Varma]: and mental models that will help you stay relevant in the future. FutureStack batches

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.080
[Amit Varma]: start every Saturday. What's more, you get a discount of a whopping 2500 rupees 2500

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.640
[Amit Varma]: if you use the discount code UNSEEN. So head on over to CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:39.640
[Amit Varma]: and use the code UNSEEN. Up Level Yourself. Pratap, welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.640
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for having me. I'm so glad to be recording this in person. The last time we

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.680
[Amit Varma]: recorded was August 2020. And that of course had to be a remote recording because COVID

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.920
[Amit Varma]: and all of us were kind of hunkered down. And I wanted to start by sort of asking you

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:01.680
[Amit Varma]: how in these months, you know how life has changed in the sense that I often feel and

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.840
[Amit Varma]: looking at myself as well, that all of this, you know, when you move to a different way

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.960
[Amit Varma]: of life, for example, when I left full time employment, more than a decade and a half

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.400
[Amit Varma]: ago and started working, the texture of your day change, you know, what you do with your

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.920
[Amit Varma]: time changes, your incentives change in terms of the things that drive you to action and

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.440
[Amit Varma]: the things that don't. And that changes the work you do that changes the person you are,

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.080
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth. And in a sense, you know, one COVID I think forced upon all of us a

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.880
[Amit Varma]: different kind of rhythm of existence, where for many men, certainly it we've had the luxury

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.240
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, perhaps a slower rhythm at times where you're not always up and about for many

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.600
[Amit Varma]: women, it's a faster, choppier rhythm, because there's so much more to deal with at home

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.040
[Amit Varma]: without household help, and so on and so forth. But in your case, how has the texture of your

00:05:52.040 --> 00:06:00.280
[Amit Varma]: day changed in a sense? And would that same kind of change also apply in terms of no longer

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:06.120
[Amit Varma]: running an institution like in the past, you were running CPR, and then you were at Ashoka,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.320
[Amit Varma]: and you're much more independent in a sense now. So how has change been for you in that

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320
[Guest]: way?

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.400
[Guest]: Oh, my gosh. So look, at one level, you know, as we share the same profession, in some senses,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.560
[Guest]: you know, we talk and write. And I think for that profession, control over your time has

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.800
[Guest]: always been, I think, much easier than in almost any other profession. And, you know,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.120
[Guest]: so at one level, I think if you're a writer, you know, COVID was actually a godsend in

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.720
[Guest]: some ways. I mean, you had the luxury of just sitting and writing, you didn't have the usual

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.960
[Guest]: phone calls disturbing you. So the sense of control over your time, at least, I think

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:54.000
[Guest]: was immense. I think the flip side of it is that your sense of how the world operates,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.640
[Guest]: I think subconsciously, I think changed quite dramatically without you realizing it. Partly,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:07.460
[Guest]: I think, you know, the last two years have also coincided with lots of tectonic changes

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:15.400
[Guest]: in the world, geopolitical changes, economic changes. And I think what COVID did was just

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:22.920
[Guest]: add to that sense of uncertainty, you're just much less in command, as it were, or much

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.640
[Guest]: less confident about your own judgments about what's happening in the world. I mean, it's

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.040
[Guest]: like making a call in the virus, right? When to mask, when is it safe? When is it not safe?

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.600
[Guest]: So that sense of uncertainty, and I think anxiety, I think has also become a part of

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:43.240
[Guest]: a kind of existential, I think, you know, condition. But I have to say, I've also been

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.640
[Guest]: surprised by just how quickly the world has rebounded from COVID. I mean, yes, we can

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.920
[Guest]: talk about, you know, changes and rhythms. And I think, as I said, I think for our professions,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.760
[Guest]: it's easier. It is gendered, as you rightly, you know, said. But if you travel the last

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:06.240
[Guest]: six to seven months, frankly, COVID seems like a distant gleam, at least in the public

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.160
[Guest]: space. I mean, obviously, it is affecting a lot of lives still. The death rates are

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.760
[Guest]: still quite high in many countries. And this has been true of humanity in general, right?

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.000
[Guest]: We always think of these catastrophic events, right? The Spanish influenza, right? You know,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.080
[Guest]: humanity was back to being what it was two or three years later. So perhaps in a couple

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.640
[Guest]: of years, we look back and say, maybe it wasn't as tectonic a shift in our lifestyles, as

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.000
[Guest]: perhaps it should have been. That's also that's a good news story, because it shows a certain

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.800
[Guest]: kind of resilience. It may not be a good news story for that means is we're not learning

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.920
[Amit Varma]: the right lessons.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.560
[Amit Varma]: So when you spoke about, you know, it changing the way you perceive how the world operates,

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.600
[Amit Varma]: or even right now, you spoke about, you know, learning the right lessons. Can you elaborate

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.600
[Amit Varma]: on those?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.840
[Guest]: So, you know, one of the things, right, for the senses, which our generations have been

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.120
[Guest]: privileged, right? I mean, you can take any arbitrarily cut off date, people born in the

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:10.000
[Guest]: late 60s, early 70s. And given the privileged positions we've occupied, one, we've never

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.280
[Guest]: had to contemplate a truly human scale, global scale catastrophe in our lifetimes. I mean,

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:24.280
[Guest]: we had, we have no memory of what that is like, right? Our dominant mythology is constant

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:30.680
[Guest]: improvement, the promise of greater control over our environment, the promise of actually

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.720
[Guest]: pretty much being able to do anything at will, I mean, at least aspirationally, even if it's

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:41.760
[Guest]: not accessible to everyone, right. And so just the consciousness, right, that actually,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.240
[Guest]: we might be at a moment where those things which we had relegated to the past, because

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.840
[Guest]: we were so confident of our control of nature, right, there will be no major pandemic, there

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.880
[Guest]: will be no major climate change induced catastrophe, or even if climate change affects it, it's

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:05.040
[Guest]: something we can control. Nuclear war, interestingly, right, non negligible risk. So I think we

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:11.280
[Guest]: are, for our generation, I think it's the first time where you're actually having to

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:17.680
[Guest]: think about those things that humanity periodically always had to throughout its existence till,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.880
[Guest]: you know, till maybe 1945, you know, or something. So that's, I think, one, you know, and we

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:30.640
[Guest]: never know what those changes actually do. I think those changes will play in our psyche,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.640
[Guest]: subconsciously and slowly. I mean, in a sense, we'll see that visible marks, I think, in

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.200
[Guest]: a while, because partly because of the global scale of these challenges, it's not, it's

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.680
[Guest]: not easy to come up with answers of what are we supposed to do about it. If you look at

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.680
[Guest]: the decline of civilisations, right, particularly climate induced decline of civilisations,

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.600
[Guest]: I mean, history is littered with civilisations, right, that were pretty confident. I mean,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.440
[Guest]: we don't know how many of them declined in this valley or whatever. But these civilisations

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:08.520
[Guest]: continue until one day they don't, right. You just look at, you know, the heat wave

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:14.240
[Guest]: this year, right? I mean, the idea that the major rivers of every country from China to

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.080
[Guest]: France to the United States are running dry is truly staggering. I mean, what it actually

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:25.600
[Guest]: does to, you know, our sense of possibility. So I think it's for the first time again,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:33.000
[Guest]: that we are having to think in planetary terms, because a planetary catastrophe is actually

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:42.200
[Amit Varma]: not a non-negligible possibility. So, you know, you kind of mentioned how, you know,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.800
[Amit Varma]: civilisations assume they're dominant until one day they're not there. And that reminded

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.520
[Amit Varma]: me of this lovely quote by Douglas Adams, which I'm just going to sort of read out,

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.680
[Amit Varma]: quote, imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, this is an interesting world

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.320
[Amit Varma]: I find myself in an interesting hole I find myself in fits me rather neatly, doesn't it?

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.680
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it. This is such

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.360
[Amit Varma]: a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up, and as gradually

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.280
[Amit Varma]: the puddle gets smaller and smaller, is still frantically hanging on to the notion that

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.000
[Amit Varma]: everything's going to be all right, because this world was meant to have a minute was

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.940
[Amit Varma]: built to have a minute. So the moment it disappears, catches him rather by surprise. I think this

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.080
[Amit Varma]: may be something we need to be on the watch out for stop code. And you know, when you

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.840
[Amit Varma]: speak about the inevitable, how progress is inevitable, that that notion that you know,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.920
[Amit Varma]: the arc of history is going towards a good place. And I must confess that that's what

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.800
[Amit Varma]: I believed as well. I think it was a default way of thinking for a lot of people that,

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, you assumed with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Berlin Wall breaking

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:49.160
[Amit Varma]: down all of that, you assume that it was indeed, as Fukuyama said, the end of history, though,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, obviously, that's a very misinterpreted essay. But that the general sentiment of

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.840
[Amit Varma]: the misinterpretation also was something that many people believed in, that we've solved

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.600
[Amit Varma]: many of these problems, the authoritarian horrors of the past are surely behind us.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:10.080
[Amit Varma]: And wherever they do exist, it will gradually recede in front of the, you know, undeniable

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.840
[Amit Varma]: logic of freedom, and so on and so forth. And, and I think so many of us have had to

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.880
[Amit Varma]: sort of recast that notion in the last few years, to the extent that many will still

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.440
[Amit Varma]: say it's a cycle, but it's going to turn back, this moment can't last forever. You know,

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:33.440
[Amit Varma]: what are your thoughts on reconsidering this? And the thing is that once we decided that

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.840
[Amit Varma]: that is the way the world was, that progress was inevitable, we also build narratives to

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.920
[Amit Varma]: explain why that was so, and that fed into a framework through which we looked at the

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:49.120
[Amit Varma]: world. And if the fact is that progress wasn't inevitable, that we can go backwards, then

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:55.600
[Amit Varma]: all of those frameworks also collapse. So in what ways have you sort of changed your

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.720
[Amit Varma]: thinking? Like, what are the major ways in which you've kind of changed or refined your

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:05.680
[Amit Varma]: thinking in the last few years? And would you say that this is still something that

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.520
[Amit Varma]: intellectuals or thinkers or so on are, you know, coming to terms with?

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:18.360
[Guest]: Gosh, as always, what a wonderfully big and profound question. And, and, you know, you've

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:24.760
[Guest]: opened the door now to speculation. Hope you won't have bias regret. Maybe this is a good

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:30.000
[Guest]: moment to kind of step back a little bit from the immediate moment. And I think just using

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.400
[Guest]: Fukuyama as a kind of benchmark, I think, to look back at the arc of history over, let's

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:44.160
[Guest]: say, the last 150, 200 years, right? Now, it seems to me that, you know, when you and

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:52.640
[Guest]: I had a confidence in progress, broadly speaking, right? In a way, it had three different strands

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:58.720
[Guest]: to it. One is what you might call technological confidence. I mean, that's the project of

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.780
[Guest]: the modern world, which is increasing mastery over nature, right, to be able to deliver

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.920
[Guest]: pretty much what we want at whim, right? The different names to it, rationalization of

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:15.760
[Guest]: the world, where more and more of the world comes under our control, right? And our confidence

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:22.600
[Guest]: about that took this really radical form that we could actually remake nature, right? That

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.540
[Guest]: we could somehow remake the planetary system, we had a kind of infrastructure species in

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:33.200
[Guest]: some ways, right? You can literally alter the face of the globe. But now there are different

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.480
[Guest]: varieties of it, you know, not just science fiction fantasies, but you know, altering

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.800
[Guest]: your genes. So, that sense of the radical reconstitution of nature, not just mastery

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.000
[Guest]: of nature, radical reconstitution of nature is something that I think had become, I think,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.240
[Guest]: common sense, right, for, I think, many of us. And if you look at the current moment,

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:57.960
[Guest]: the only people who seem to be optimists are people who are still in that techno solution

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.400
[Guest]: space. I mean, that's like a whole sort of, you know, different universe. What energy

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:09.040
[Guest]: crisis, you know, the cost of solar will be zero in five years, we'll be fine. What fruit

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.640
[Guest]: crisis, we can synthesize plant based proteins and labs, we'll be fine in five years, right?

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:21.360
[Guest]: But I think the question in some senses is whether this techno solutionism, right, is

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:27.080
[Guest]: actually the right or the adequate approach to this moment. So, that's, I think, one,

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:33.560
[Guest]: I think, you know, I think, in some senses, long term. The second project, which was,

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.080
[Guest]: I think, an interesting one, which I think comes out of the French revolutionary tradition,

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:44.400
[Guest]: but I think is at the heart of almost all modern politics, right, is creating a political

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:51.280
[Guest]: order that is a product of our conscious design, right, which, in a sense, not just reflects

00:16:51.280 --> 00:17:00.120
[Guest]: our status as free and equal people, but in some senses, is not confined by the encumbrances

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:05.560
[Guest]: of historical necessity, right? There's something veiled about it, there's something legitimate

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:11.680
[Guest]: about it, there's something justified about it. And I think one of the paradoxes, I think,

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:19.520
[Guest]: of our particular moment is that ambition of creating a social order that would be justified

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:26.840
[Guest]: to all. That's actually the ambition we gave up the first, right? So, we think of the nation-state

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:34.600
[Guest]: form and capitalism, just to take two social forms, as kind of more or less necessary for

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.400
[Guest]: our social existence, in a way in which we aren't even taking nature as necessary for

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.600
[Guest]: our social existence, right? I mean, there's a kind of weight of necessity that comes to

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.120
[Guest]: our social arrangements, that is actually quite surprising. I mean, that in some senses,

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.640
[Guest]: you know, that's the paradox of modernity, right? We were supposed to remake our societies,

00:17:52.640 --> 00:18:00.160
[Guest]: we've ended up remaking nature, without quite remaking our societies. And at this moment,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.640
[Guest]: right, that poses a particular challenge, which is that if you actually have this crisis

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.800
[Guest]: around, let's say, climate change, around nature, around this project of mastery, are

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:18.000
[Guest]: these two institutional forms, the nation-state form, and broadly capitalism, I'm using it

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.520
[Guest]: loosely at the moment, are they actually fit for purpose for solving the problems that

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:31.720
[Guest]: we actually need to solve? Are they the solution? Are they in some sense, as part of the problem?

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.280
[Guest]: And how much of the kind of sense of crisis that we have is the sense that, you know,

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.080
[Guest]: they've delivered lots of goods. I mean, you can't imagine modern citizenship outside the

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:47.520
[Guest]: nation-state. You can't imagine liberating the individual in some senses, from the oppression

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.480
[Guest]: of tradition outside of the confines of the nation-state often. Capitalism, certainly

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:57.120
[Guest]: in some forms, at least, has delivered extraordinary levels of material prosperity to certain parts

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:06.040
[Guest]: of the world. But I think there is a palpable sense that we've kind of plateaued in some

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:11.720
[Guest]: senses on what they can actually provide, and whether they can actually solve anything

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.720
[Guest]: this problem. So, you know, it's an interesting moment where you're kind of opening yourself

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:23.000
[Guest]: up to at least much more bigger scale thinking, that maybe the solution will not just be tinkering

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.080
[Guest]: at the edges, it will require slightly more radically reimagination of our social forms,

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:36.240
[Guest]: holding on to what's important in them, right? But in some senses, creatively, I think transcending

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:45.760
[Guest]: that. The third, I think, feature, right, which, in some senses, was this question of,

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.320
[Guest]: and I know this is a subject that's close to your heart amongst others, you've written

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:56.320
[Guest]: eloquently about this, the dignity of the individual and individual freedom, right?

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:05.800
[Guest]: That both the enterprise of liberalism and democracy, psychologically, they rely on a

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.280
[Guest]: certain kind of presumptive trust that people have in each other, right? That's partly why

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:15.840
[Guest]: you can leave them to their own devices. But the presumptive trust is not just that they're

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:21.960
[Guest]: going to be good at making judgements about things that affect them. But the presumptive

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:27.160
[Guest]: trust also requires a certain kind of reciprocity. That's why in some senses, equality and liberty

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.680
[Guest]: have always gone together. I mean, it's equal liberty for all in some ways, right? That's

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:40.440
[Guest]: very important. And I think one of the challenges, I think, in some senses, we see is the foundations

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:48.240
[Guest]: of what creates societies where there is an adequate level of reciprocity, right? And

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:53.400
[Guest]: I think reciprocity is the key term here, because everything else follows from reciprocity,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.000
[Guest]: right? Whether I respect your liberty, and you respect mine, I mean, that's a form of

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.160
[Guest]: reciprocity. What are the conditions under which forms of reciprocity are created, right,

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:11.000
[Guest]: that can sustain levels of trust? I don't think we have a good handle on that. Some

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.080
[Guest]: societies for a little while seem to have it a little more than others. But the crisis

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:22.240
[Guest]: of authoritarianism, the crisis of liberal democracy, the crisis of freedom is in part

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:29.080
[Guest]: this complete absence of reciprocity, right? Which makes any projects for furthering each

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.360
[Guest]: other's freedom seem almost impossible.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:38.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and, you know, you went on Shruti's podcast, and you spoke about Adam Smith. And

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.240
[Amit Varma]: this is like one of the fundamental points you made, which, you know, made me think a

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:47.760
[Amit Varma]: lot about, you know, it's not just about self interest in Smith's work, it's about reciprocity.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.960
[Amit Varma]: And that goes a bit deeper. In the last episode that we did together, like one of the things

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.280
[Amit Varma]: I mentioned that I think about, from time to time, is how, if I look at the story of

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.640
[Amit Varma]: human progress, especially perhaps since the Enlightenment, one narrative that is there

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:08.400
[Amit Varma]: is about how we are using reason, which of course, we are we are wired to have reason,

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:15.320
[Amit Varma]: but we are using reason to sort of mitigate the negative aspects of our hardwiring, right.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:20.480
[Amit Varma]: And of course, we have contradictory hardwiring, we are hardwired for both tribalism and altruism,

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.520
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth. But we mitigate the negative aspects of that by actually, you

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.800
[Amit Varma]: know, thinking about it and realizing that no, you know, I might be hardwired to have

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.840
[Amit Varma]: kids, but I don't want kids, or I might be hardwired to be tribalistic and hate the other

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:39.080
[Amit Varma]: but hey, no, we are all the same, right? And you use reason in that sense. And it seems

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:45.400
[Amit Varma]: to me that that might, you know, in a way, again, there was an illusion of progress there,

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:50.560
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, reason is proceeding. But in a way, it may be a bit of a losing battle,

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.120
[Amit Varma]: or at least a really difficult battle, if I look at modern times, because every newborn

00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:00.800
[Amit Varma]: baby is born with the hardwiring that is there, but without, you know, the rest of the work

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:07.200
[Amit Varma]: remains. And it's so easy for those knobs to be turned, as it were the tribalism knob

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:12.840
[Amit Varma]: and the violence knob and all of those kind of knobs to be turned. So that's sort of what

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:18.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, what kind of worries me a bit. And in a sense, I think also, the tech solution

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:25.000
[Amit Varma]: solutionism that you mentioned, could also, you know, have relevance with how a lot of

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.880
[Amit Varma]: people think about the second problem that you mentioned about a political order and

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.720
[Amit Varma]: capitalism and all of that. And my sense is that we are the tech solution solutionism

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.040
[Amit Varma]: takes us to a space where we imagine that all problems are solvable. Now, obviously,

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.840
[Amit Varma]: all problems are not solvable, there will be a time the planet won't exist at all, there

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.200
[Amit Varma]: will be a time much before that, that humans won't exist on the planet. And those are long

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:54.760
[Amit Varma]: term problems, but we can push them away. But you know what I think, you know, capitalism

00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:00.960
[Amit Varma]: and building certain political orders with institutions and all of that can solve limited

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.640
[Amit Varma]: problems, but not deeper problems. For example, capitalism can help people get what they desire,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:12.720
[Amit Varma]: but it cannot shape what they desire. Right? And if what they desire is not something that

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.600
[Amit Varma]: we with a liberal mindset would consider, hey, these are the things you should desire,

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:22.720
[Amit Varma]: then we sort of have an issue there. I mean, I'm kind of rambling a bit, but I totally

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.320
[Amit Varma]: get where you're coming from. And I'll ask you to double click on the second of those

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:32.480
[Amit Varma]: points. You know, in a different space, you've also written about how we are prisoners of

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.480
[Amit Varma]: an 18th century conception when it comes to the state and its institutions and all that.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.000
[Amit Varma]: Can you elaborate on that a bit?

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.080
[Guest]: So with your permission, can I back up to your very important point about reason, actually,

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.960
[Guest]: because I actually think it is something we don't get to discuss often. I mean, I think

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:56.960
[Guest]: in some ways, you know, I think we, as you said, reason has become, again, a common part

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:02.560
[Guest]: of our kind of ideological repertoire and we move forward with it. So when we think

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:07.640
[Guest]: of reason, right, and, you know, whether you take the Enlightenment Project, but not just

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.800
[Guest]: the Enlightenment Project, I mean, I think sometimes identifying reason with the Enlightenment

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:17.480
[Guest]: Project, you know, also makes it much more culturally specific than reason is. I mean,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:24.400
[Guest]: you know, there have been rational people, rational thinkers all across, right? I think

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:30.880
[Guest]: we have to understand three or four things about reason, right? And this is the hard

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:43.280
[Guest]: part, I think. So one, I think is, look, even rationality as a history in some ways. And

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:51.040
[Guest]: by that, I mean, not the proposition that everything is relative to culture, right?

00:25:51.040 --> 00:26:00.120
[Guest]: But things that are taken as expressions of rational behaviour will actually vary. And

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:08.720
[Guest]: in some senses, reason itself cannot adjudicate between that variation, right? What do you

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:16.960
[Guest]: want to optimise on in your life? Right? Lots of plausible candidates, right? Most of them

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.720
[Guest]: are probably rational candidates, right? I mean, you could make a case for them after

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:31.360
[Guest]: reflection, right? But reason in some senses is always going to under-determine many of

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.640
[Guest]: the ends we would want to actually pursue. And I think this is an insight I think pluralists

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:40.040
[Guest]: have had everywhere. I mean, whether it's kind of Jain Anekant Vards, or, you know,

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:49.400
[Guest]: Isaiah Berlin in some senses, right? That the idea that reason over-determines your

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.880
[Guest]: choices, right? The way we think of it in mathematics, once you've seen two plus two

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:58.400
[Guest]: equals four, you cannot but believe that and there is no other option, right? For most

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:04.280
[Guest]: of the things that in some senses matter to our lives, right? Reason will under-determine

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:14.640
[Guest]: your choices. And I think a lot of the pulls we feel around the conflicts of values, right?

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.000
[Guest]: The harder cases are one where there are actually between reasonable choices. It's not that

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.600
[Guest]: people I mean, it's not that somebody who says, look, I want to lead a somewhat traditional

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:31.920
[Guest]: sedate life, you know, like the comforts of community, like the comforts of predictability,

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.960
[Guest]: is actually being unreasonable, as opposed to somebody who says, look, I want to jet

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:40.240
[Guest]: set across the world, I want to sort of just mix cultures, I want to, I mean, you can make

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:46.280
[Guest]: plausible cases that they're actually both fulfilling ways of living a life, right? And

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.960
[Guest]: it's not clear that reason is going to be able to, in some senses, adjudicate between

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:57.440
[Guest]: them, right? So reason under-determines that. The second, I think, challenge with reason

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:05.080
[Guest]: is whether the cast of the world is inherently tragic. And by tragic, one just means the

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:12.200
[Guest]: idea that lots of good things cannot coexist together, right? So if you are building a

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:21.040
[Guest]: community that's actually optimising on familiarity, the comfort of knowing each other intimately,

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.200
[Guest]: versus building a community where you have the strength of, you know, weak ties, as it

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:32.760
[Guest]: were, or let's say, you're optimising on efficiency versus optimising on localism. Again, both

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.280
[Guest]: are reasonable, in some sense, but both cannot exist in the same social structure in the

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.800
[Guest]: same social space, right? And I think this is something I think many liberals did understand

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:48.480
[Guest]: that I think there is a kind of tragic cast to the world. And I think the excessively

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:54.400
[Guest]: rationalist liberalism that actually denies that there is a kind of loss here, is actually

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.520
[Guest]: missing out something. It itself is being, I think, unreasonable, right? So there's a

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:05.320
[Guest]: second, I think, dimension to this, I think, this tragic cast of the world. The third dimension

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.760
[Guest]: to reason, and now I'm coming to the point about the state in some ways, right, which

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:16.080
[Guest]: is perhaps related to the tragic cast of the world, is that, you know, some of the big

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:24.560
[Guest]: challenges that we face, do not arise from things that are straightforwardly evil. I

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:31.200
[Guest]: mean, that would be easy to, in some senses, pinpoint and identify, right? Let's say, let's

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:37.600
[Guest]: take the theme you use tribalism, right? Where I'm in complete agreement with you. I mean,

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:44.120
[Guest]: I tend to just think collective pronouns are generally deformations of individual moral

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:49.960
[Guest]: life. I think collective pronouns, in some senses, I think, mutilate individuality often

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:58.320
[Guest]: in ways that are quite hurtful for both morality and creativity. But if you think of the modern

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:08.000
[Guest]: forms of tribalism, what makes them, right, potent, what makes them ominous, is not that,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.080
[Guest]: you know, we are tribal, that we want some kind of, you know, fuzzy, ruddy feeling of

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:17.200
[Guest]: sort of belonging, or, you know, living in communities that are the same. I mean, you

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.440
[Guest]: know, there could be versions of that, that are actually quite livable, quite harmless,

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:30.720
[Guest]: quite benign. It is that it has become tied with a political form that we actually value

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:36.400
[Guest]: for independent reasons, right? So, if you think of modern democracy, right, I mean,

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:42.120
[Guest]: what makes modern tribalism really, you know, extraordinary, both in its attraction and

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:49.280
[Guest]: in its destructive power, is modern democracy raises the question, who constitutes the people?

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:54.480
[Guest]: The question of who is the people is going to raise the question of membership, who gets

00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:00.700
[Guest]: to be in and who gets to be out. And again, the tragic cast of the world, that unless

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:05.760
[Guest]: you believe in a universal community, a form that is actually organized under a single

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:11.920
[Guest]: political form, the question of inclusion and exclusion will remain at the heart of

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:22.320
[Guest]: democracy. It's unavoidable, right? Modern states require taxation, deep forms of taxation.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:27.720
[Guest]: They do so many more things for us than ancient states and medieval states did. I mean, they

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:32.960
[Guest]: literally reconstitute us in every single way from kind of healthcare, education, pastoral

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:38.960
[Guest]: care, you just, you know, you can name it, right? So, to generate the kinds of resources

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:46.240
[Guest]: they require, requires very different forms of solidarity, right? In some ways, you really

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:52.200
[Guest]: do have to think of this as a shared enterprise in a way in which perhaps a medieval citizen

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.800
[Guest]: doesn't. I mean, you know, kings come and go, politics dances lightly at the surface,

00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:01.520
[Guest]: so long as you're not messing too much around, right? With either my life or my inherited

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:07.720
[Guest]: social forms, I don't particularly care, right? And the modern state was also the necessary

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:13.680
[Guest]: instrument for all these technological projects that we imagined in some ways, right? So,

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:20.500
[Guest]: we want all those good things from the modern state, right? Democracy, greater enhancement

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:26.760
[Guest]: in our collective power, right? But those things also require very different forms of

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:32.200
[Guest]: solidarity. And that solidarity has a name in the modern world, which is nationalism.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:37.720
[Guest]: I mean, modern nationalism is modern in some ways. I mean, tribalism has always been around,

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:46.000
[Guest]: right? But this form of tribalism then, you know, when it allies two things, right? Greater

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.120
[Guest]: requirements of identification and solidarity with greater power, because now you also have

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:58.520
[Guest]: the state as an instrument, right? You actually have a perfect storm on your hands. So, I

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:04.080
[Guest]: think the issue, as the way I see the issue is not, are we hardwired for tribalism? I

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:10.240
[Guest]: mean, at a 30,000 feet level, that's probably true that other things being equal, we might

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:15.680
[Guest]: feel more comfortable in contexts that are familiar, people that are familiar, certain

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:23.320
[Guest]: kinds of solidarities in some senses might be easier, right? That has always been around.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:30.840
[Guest]: But the specific form it takes in the modern nation state, right, is of a completely different

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.640
[Guest]: order. And as I said, the disquieting news is that a lot of it stems from the good things

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.600
[Guest]: we want from the state, right? Again, the tragic character of many of these institutions.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:48.560
[Amit Varma]: So, here's a thought on reason, and perhaps part of the tragic cast of the world itself.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.080
[Amit Varma]: Have you heard of, there was a neuroscientist called Michael Gazzaniga, have you heard of

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.080
[Guest]: this experiment?

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I don't know the work well, but yes, I have.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. So, he carried out these experiments on split brain epilepsy, where apparently

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:05.280
[Amit Varma]: for a particular kind of epilepsy, the way to cure it was to severe the corpus callosum,

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.920
[Amit Varma]: if I remember correctly, basically, what connects the right brain to the left brain, and the

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.840
[Amit Varma]: right brain controls on the left side of the body and vice versa. You know, while carrying

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:18.360
[Amit Varma]: out these procedures on patients like this, he carried out an interesting experiment,

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.880
[Amit Varma]: where the right side of the brain, which is more intuitive, and all of that would be given

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:28.920
[Amit Varma]: a particular instruction, like raise your hand or ask for water or whatever. And the

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.680
[Amit Varma]: person would do it like if he sees a sign, raise your hand, he'd raise his hand, then

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:36.120
[Amit Varma]: he'd be asked, why did you raise your hand? And because there is no connection between

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.640
[Amit Varma]: the right side and the left side of the brain, the other side of the brain would then make

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:44.520
[Amit Varma]: up an explanation for that, that my armpits were itchy. For example, I mean, I'm just

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:49.320
[Amit Varma]: kind of thinking aloud in terms of I don't remember the specific examples, but basically,

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:56.600
[Amit Varma]: and Gazzaniga's point was that he called the left side of the brain, the interpreter, right?

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:02.720
[Amit Varma]: His point was that the person did not raise his hand because the armpit was itchy. But

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.160
[Amit Varma]: that is what the person actually believes, because a part of the brain, which he called

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:12.320
[Amit Varma]: the interpreter came up with that explanation. And to me, this is sort of a metaphor for

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:18.080
[Amit Varma]: a larger thing, a larger phenomenon, which is that often we are not reasoning, we are

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:23.000
[Amit Varma]: rationalizing, that we do what we do, we follow impulses without even being aware of them

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.400
[Amit Varma]: ourselves. And then we cloak it in the garb of reason. And I'm sure we both had occasion

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:36.720
[Amit Varma]: to think about this in recent times, where both in the US and in India, people who otherwise

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.120
[Amit Varma]: seemed principled, you know, whether it's people within the Republican Party, who once

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:45.680
[Amit Varma]: upon a time supported trade, and so on and so forth, are now supporting Trump, despite

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:51.880
[Amit Varma]: the fact that he goes against all the values they deeply believed in, or people in India,

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:57.040
[Amit Varma]: for example, who supported Modi in 2014, which is fine, you know, you could support him for

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:03.080
[Amit Varma]: good reasons then, but who continued supporting him, after it became apparent that his actions

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.480
[Amit Varma]: go against all the principles they espouse. And therefore, the conclusion to draw there

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:12.600
[Amit Varma]: and a rather depressing conclusion, for me, is that they never really believed in the

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:18.160
[Amit Varma]: principles or the worldview that they espoused. They had instead joined a tribe or taken a

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:23.640
[Amit Varma]: position and now they are part of that. And they'll rationalize as much as they need to

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:29.440
[Amit Varma]: to kind of stay there. And therefore, the thought that comes to my mind is that is reason

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:35.960
[Amit Varma]: and illusion, that even when you and me sit, you know, we have also cast ourselves in the

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:41.080
[Amit Varma]: world in a particular way, we play a certain role in our little ecosystems, whatever they

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:46.600
[Amit Varma]: are, and we are looked at by people in a certain way. And we are going to continue along those

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:51.320
[Amit Varma]: paths. Like, for example, I have come to believe that there cannot possibly be free will, it

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:56.400
[Amit Varma]: doesn't make sense. However, we must keep behaving as if there is, right. So in a similar

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:01.880
[Amit Varma]: sense, and I'm thinking aloud here, that, you know, you could argue that we must continue

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:07.040
[Amit Varma]: trying to be reasonable, even though perhaps reason is impossible. Is that then part of

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:12.880
[Amit Varma]: the tragic cast of the world, as you say, that we are all playing this game, where even

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:18.360
[Amit Varma]: we are not completely in control of what we do and what we think and why?

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:26.000
[Guest]: So there's a lot, there's lots in what you said, actually, and again, very large themes.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.480
[Guest]: So one point, which I'll just say and kind of put aside, because I'm not sure I'm kind

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:38.920
[Guest]: of competent to talk about it, is there is no question that there is a kind of depth

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:46.760
[Guest]: to our psyche that we don't fully understand. And you can come at this through psychoanalysis,

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:52.600
[Guest]: whatever else one may think about Freud, I think this idea that in a sense, even our

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:58.680
[Guest]: overt reasonable actions may actually be over determined in some senses, thick with causality,

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:03.160
[Guest]: in a way which we don't understand. I think that idea is, the text like the Yoga Vashishth

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.680
[Guest]: in some senses, you know, where our psyche has just layers and layers and layers and

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:14.720
[Guest]: layers and what in some senses moves us is not something that is actually fully graspable

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:21.280
[Guest]: by us. And in some senses, you know, if you think of the entire Indian tradition, why

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:25.360
[Guest]: the problem of consciousness is central to it, right? Because in part, the problem of

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:33.680
[Guest]: consciousness is actually related to the problem of reason and unconscious in some ways, right?

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:41.520
[Guest]: What would it mean for us to be fully transparent to ourselves? And who is the it that is transparent

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:48.120
[Guest]: and who are they transparent to, right? So, in that sense, yes, I mean, I think and you

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:55.120
[Guest]: could actually argue that despite advances in science, I think our understanding of the

00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:02.440
[Guest]: psyche is probably no more sophisticated than it was, you know, when the authors of the

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:07.680
[Guest]: Yoga Vashisht or when Plato were writing, I mean, there is a kind of and perhaps I think

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:14.160
[Guest]: for those authors, I think it was easier to comprehend it because there wasn't this mythology

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:19.360
[Guest]: that we are fully in control of ourselves. So, in some senses that actually, I think

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:24.520
[Guest]: much more aware of those kinds of demonic forces, rationalizations that actually take

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:29.440
[Guest]: place, right? And that's where I think, you know, I think we do have a kind of question

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:36.640
[Guest]: of how far has reason succeeded in bringing enlightenment, right? But there's another

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.760
[Guest]: aspect, I think the reason rationalization story that he said, which is quite profound,

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:47.320
[Guest]: which is, see, fundamentally, when we think of reason, you can think of it as a faculty,

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:55.000
[Guest]: right? And this is the way psychologists study it. But there's a reason why most of the thinkers

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.360
[Guest]: of the Enlightenment, and not just thinkers of the Enlightenment, again, any philosophical

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:06.640
[Guest]: tradition has always thought of reason as a social activity. And by social activity,

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:14.840
[Guest]: I mean, the idea that the norm of what counts is valid, is inter subjectively validated.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:20.200
[Guest]: It's not just you saying, I have applied my reason, right? If you think of the practice

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:26.560
[Guest]: of science, in some senses, right, the practice of science requires agreement upon a method

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:33.280
[Guest]: on what counts as valid inference or a valid experiment in some sense, right? Partly it's

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:42.120
[Guest]: to check this conflation of subjectivism and reason, right? The surest check of whether

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:46.800
[Guest]: it's a rationalization or not is that when you present the logic of your justification,

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:52.720
[Guest]: can somebody else enter into that logic of justification and see through it, right? Even

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:57.200
[Guest]: Immanuel Kant, I mean, you know, one of the most profound things he said, in a sense,

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:06.400
[Guest]: is reason and freedom have an intimate connection. One of the reasons we value freedom is in

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:14.200
[Guest]: part to make this inter subject exchange as free as possible, right? Now, the question

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:23.160
[Guest]: then becomes in what are the areas, right, where you have a reasonable level of inter

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:28.160
[Guest]: subjective agreement over what counts as a reasonable answer to this question. And again,

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:33.580
[Guest]: to put it a little bit crudely, I mean, this is a gross oversimplification, but many would

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:37.440
[Guest]: argue that in the case of certain forms of science and mathematics, that is probably

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:45.560
[Guest]: in some sense of the case, philosophical logic, right? Now, there was this hope that the same

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:52.040
[Guest]: kind of sociality of reason could actually be applied to human affairs, right? That's

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.920
[Guest]: the big idea of the modern democratic public sphere, right? Only those governments are

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:02.520
[Guest]: legitimate that pass laws that are freely accepted by everyone, right? And so you have

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:07.280
[Guest]: to engage in dialogue, you have to engage in that reciprocity, right? Now, the problem

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:13.940
[Guest]: with that story, to my mind, again, it I think, story to keep harping on the reciprocity themes,

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:20.240
[Guest]: is that it actually presupposes that I'm granting you a standing in the same space that I am

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.880
[Guest]: to begin with. And that's the hardest part in the moral point of view, right? Because

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:29.320
[Guest]: once you've granted that, then lots of things become possible, right? So, that was one,

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:35.560
[Guest]: I think, weakness in that story that I think we still don't have an account of what is

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:41.960
[Guest]: it that induces people to take broadly what we call the moral point of view. And the moral

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:47.760
[Guest]: point of view by its character has to be universalizable. The point about universalizability is not that

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:54.720
[Guest]: everybody is the same. The point about universalizability is that everybody can partake in the reasoning

00:42:54.720 --> 00:43:02.040
[Guest]: and see yes, this is a genuine reason, not just your arbitrary whim, right? So, I think

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:08.760
[Guest]: that the second thing I think about, I think, this intersubjective agreement in the public

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:14.120
[Guest]: sphere is, and this reverts back to the point about the psyche and the unconscious. You

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:19.600
[Guest]: know, when we teach political theory, there's one exam question we always set students,

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:27.480
[Guest]: which is, what does a particular theorist fear most? Right? And in some senses, you

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:35.560
[Guest]: can actually deduce a lot of what they're writing from that fear. I mean, my computer

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.560
[Guest]: science friend will say the flip side of it is, what are you trying to optimize on most,

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:47.480
[Guest]: right? So, those who fear, right, the tyranny of the state end up favoring limited government.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:54.240
[Guest]: Those who fear, let's say, in societies like India, the social experience of incredibly

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.400
[Guest]: humiliating inequality, right, will perhaps be open to a slightly greater role for the

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:04.840
[Guest]: state, right? Now, I think the interesting question to me in all these conversations,

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:15.160
[Guest]: the example of the Republicans and so forth, right, is what is the core fear that is getting

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:23.240
[Guest]: them to take the position that they are in fact taking? And you can sport a rationalization,

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:32.040
[Guest]: right, where either the purported solution is actually not answering the fear that this

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:42.320
[Guest]: state is the fear, right? I mean, that's one hint in some senses, right? So, for example,

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.120
[Guest]: old fashioned conservatives would say that, look, you know, our concern with liberals

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:53.280
[Guest]: is they're not ethical, they're not moral, no family values, right? Turns out, you know,

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.160
[Guest]: Trump's hardly a supporter of family values in any sense. That's a clear case, right,

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:04.560
[Guest]: where it's becoming obvious that that was not the fear that was driving you. The family

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:09.560
[Guest]: values thing was a code for something else. And now that circumstances have changed, that

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:15.960
[Guest]: code in some senses can be, I think, dispensed it. And I think what we are having a hard

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:25.000
[Guest]: time, I think, in our democracies is finding a way to articulate and express those fears

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.760
[Guest]: in a way in which they can become the object of some kind of mutual resolution. Now, one

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:34.840
[Guest]: reason for that may be that you don't want a mutual resolution, right? This is often

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:40.640
[Guest]: the case between enmity between groups, racism, for example, right? That if it is your unstated

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:48.960
[Guest]: fear that the demographic power of your community is going to lose, you've also be socialized

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.840
[Guest]: by reason enough to say that you can't actually say those things because it violates all kinds

00:45:53.840 --> 00:46:00.240
[Guest]: of norms of equality and liberty, right? Then you are in a political discourse, where you

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.600
[Guest]: are being motivated by something that can never be subject to any kind of intersubjective

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:10.120
[Guest]: validation. And that's, in a sense, a disaster for politics, right?

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.320
[Amit Varma]: Couple of thoughts and the first one just taking off from this is, I mean, I love that

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:18.160
[Amit Varma]: question about what do you fear the most? That kind of explains so much. I mean, there

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.960
[Amit Varma]: is that famous saying about where you stand depends on where you sit. It therefore strikes

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:27.360
[Amit Varma]: me that what might be happening in modern politics is therefore this kind of vicious

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.800
[Amit Varma]: circle where we are all pushed to the extremes. So let us say that there are two parties,

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:36.160
[Amit Varma]: let's not call them right and left or conservatives and progressives or whatever. But just in

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:41.800
[Amit Varma]: a thought experiment, there are two parties, each one fears the other one gaining dominance,

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:47.520
[Amit Varma]: and their expression of that fear is a movement to the extremes of their own position, right?

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:53.240
[Amit Varma]: And this is exacerbated by say, social media, which is, which, you know, which amplifies

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:57.240
[Amit Varma]: everything and which amplifies this drive to the extremes, because the only way you

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:01.640
[Amit Varma]: raise your status within your tribe is by doing more and more posturing and being more

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:06.600
[Amit Varma]: and more shrill and judgmental and pure, as it were. And therefore, what happens is that

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.760
[Amit Varma]: what you fear when you look at the other side, and you see this happening, what you fear

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:16.240
[Amit Varma]: is becoming more fearful. And therefore, both sides are becoming more afraid. And as a response

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:22.200
[Amit Varma]: to that more and more fearful, till they are eventually caricatures of what they used to

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:29.200
[Amit Varma]: be used to be. And there is no longer that sort of middle ground, right? Like, for example,

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:34.240
[Amit Varma]: our dominant way of thinking about politics once used to be that there is always this

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:38.460
[Amit Varma]: move to the center, like there's a median voter theorem that the Democrats and the Republicans

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.280
[Amit Varma]: may swing to the extremes in the primaries to get the true believers in, but they'll

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:46.960
[Amit Varma]: swing to the center. And therefore, you know, in 2016, the two candidates you would have

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:51.680
[Amit Varma]: expected were Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, who are pretty much identical, slight difference

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:56.240
[Amit Varma]: in the interest groups which influence them, but they both very centrist. And instead,

00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:01.840
[Amit Varma]: you had what appeared to be a black swan event, but now no longer seems that way. And it now

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:08.840
[Amit Varma]: seems that both parties are, you know, swinging more and more towards their extreme ends.

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:15.400
[Amit Varma]: So what's your sense of this? Because just looking at the processes involved in this

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.840
[Amit Varma]: and the incentives and the imperatives involved in this, it would seem like this is a vicious

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.800
[Amit Varma]: circle out of which we cannot escape.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:27.600
[Guest]: So I mean, let me kind of dimmer with you a little bit, I think, because again, I think

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.760
[Guest]: that three or four things that need to be distributed, three or four levels of the argument,

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:36.120
[Guest]: I think. So one, I'm actually not convinced entirely that there's evidence that the middle

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:41.920
[Guest]: ground is not possible. It's certainly not reflecting in the politics that we are seeing,

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:48.080
[Guest]: because the very same opinion polls, right, they show political polarization. Actually,

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:55.240
[Guest]: even a lot of issues show a lot of and quite remarkable convergence, actually. I mean,

00:48:55.240 --> 00:49:00.440
[Guest]: you know, and it is actually remarkable how most issues, most large numbers of people

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:05.840
[Guest]: actually turn out to be pretty moderate in some ways. I mean, that's right. So if that

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:10.440
[Guest]: is the case, then I think there's a particular question about, is there something about the

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:16.920
[Guest]: institutional designs that we have that percolate public opinion, at least with the way they

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:22.200
[Guest]: are channeled through politics, that actually produces a polarized politics that is actually

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:28.760
[Guest]: quite out of sync, in some senses, with a lot of the values common ground that we have.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:36.240
[Guest]: And I would like to think that I think a lot of it is, I think, I think this is the case,

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:41.040
[Guest]: I think there is an institutional story here. In the US, you could probably tell an institutional

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:48.040
[Guest]: story about the nature of the primaries. I mean, you know, there's a lot of kind of good

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:54.360
[Guest]: literature that one of the reasons you did not see actually all polarization in the old

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:59.440
[Guest]: sense, although the US has had a history of it, by the way, I think there's a lot of amnesia

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:06.520
[Guest]: around the 50s and the 60s. But even if we grant that, you know, polarization is increased,

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:10.960
[Guest]: the way candidates used to be selected, parties used to be more controlled by party bosses,

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:17.040
[Guest]: which provided a level of mediation. Actually, one of the paradoxical consequences of primaries

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:22.560
[Guest]: is that in primaries, only your base is energized. So in some senses, you're actually appealing

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:29.800
[Guest]: to your base, right? There's a second phenomenon, which is the division into red and white states.

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:36.040
[Guest]: Now, the reason that that produces radicalism in the parties, right, is that if you're competing,

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:39.640
[Guest]: let's say, in a democratic state, the only way you differentiate yourself from your democratic

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:44.640
[Guest]: computer is actually by wearing slightly more left, right, which is a very different logic

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:49.840
[Guest]: than if you actually had to compete with somebody, you know, on the right where you try and actually

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:56.400
[Guest]: triangulate. If you look at the voting patterns, right, I mean, let's not forget, the popular

00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:03.000
[Guest]: vote still goes in the favor of Democrats. There is the particular artifact of American

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:09.640
[Guest]: institutions, which gives lots of veto powers, right, to small minorities, you know, not

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:15.360
[Guest]: selected from a small state. So you could actually argue that the processes of channeling

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:21.960
[Guest]: popular will, right, are no longer fit for purpose. And again, it goes back to what do

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:28.480
[Guest]: you fear most. In the 18th century, right, when the American Constitution was set up,

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:33.840
[Guest]: there were two big fears, right? One was the fear of tyranny, right, which was the fear

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:40.320
[Guest]: of, you know, monarchy in some ways. And the second was the concern for federalism, because

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:46.040
[Guest]: the American compromise rested on allowing slavery, which could be justified only a federal

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:50.440
[Guest]: compact. That's why American institutions were denied design the way they were like

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:57.520
[Guest]: lots of these little veto points, right? They're trying to answer a slightly different problem

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:03.160
[Guest]: from a problem of how do you actually channelize, right, let's say, collective action on climate

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:09.080
[Guest]: change, where the very same thing that's actually a virtue, when you want to perhaps defend

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:14.880
[Guest]: liberty, right, that maybe five judges can actually hold up a piece of tyrannical legislation,

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:19.640
[Guest]: they often did not, that's a different matter, but in principle, they could, actually is

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:26.600
[Guest]: a liability, right? Where one senator, who, again, great for federalism, right, every

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:32.680
[Guest]: state can exercise power in the system. It turns out that that's a liability. So I think

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:36.640
[Guest]: some of the, I think, radicalism question, I think, is actually really about that kind

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:41.880
[Guest]: of political institutional design question. There's a thing, a third level that you pointed

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:48.360
[Guest]: out, which I think is quite important and deep, and there you feel something about the

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:55.400
[Guest]: ground which we are occupying is shifting. That has to do with the nature of modern media

00:52:55.400 --> 00:53:03.720
[Guest]: and communication, and social media in particular, but not just social media. Now, one way of

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:08.440
[Guest]: thinking about that, and again, to kind of step back, you know, look at the longer arc

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:20.760
[Guest]: of history. So, you know, most of us assume that proper communication requires the sharing

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:28.760
[Guest]: of some context, right? Interpreting any gesture, right? Is it a twitch or a wink to use, you

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:36.640
[Guest]: know, the famous example from Gilbert Ryle, right, requires thick knowledge of that context,

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:44.160
[Guest]: right? Let us say you tweet tomorrow, right? I don't know, you just tweet a picture of

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:51.200
[Guest]: Lord Ganesh, just kind of, you know, there's 55 possible meanings I could attribute to

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:58.200
[Guest]: your tweet. Maybe you just like this painting. Maybe you are a devout Ganesh bhakt. Maybe

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:02.140
[Guest]: you're subtly trolling somebody, who knows? I mean, you know, maybe you're religious,

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:08.480
[Guest]: maybe you're sacrilegious, right? Now, one of the things that I think has happened is

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:14.240
[Guest]: that our modern forms of communication, particularly when you're doing it on a mass scale, and

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:22.780
[Guest]: without the mediation of organizations, there is a easy decontextualization and recontextualization

00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:32.660
[Guest]: of everything, right? Which is making the meaning of pretty much anything that you say

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:38.800
[Guest]: or do, actually pretty unstable. Now, postmodernists would, you know, point out that we've been

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:44.480
[Guest]: always saying this about communication, there's always a kind of slipperiness to communication,

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:53.360
[Guest]: right? That what makes meanings of terms intelligible is a lot of that shared context, right? Now,

00:54:53.360 --> 00:55:00.400
[Guest]: once that opens up, right, you actually have forms of argument, where there's no space,

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:04.960
[Guest]: where there's no institutional mechanism for saying, okay, what are the protocols of

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:10.280
[Guest]: truth that we share? What counts as a good answer to this question? All you see, in a

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:14.660
[Guest]: sense, is the expression of those fears, the expression of, you know, something that by

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:20.640
[Guest]: itself actually is quite unintelligible, even without that thick context. Second, what it

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:28.160
[Guest]: allows you to do is it allows you to mobilize constituencies that are no longer local, right?

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:34.880
[Guest]: So, let's say, for argument's sake, I was a religious conservative. If my focus was

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:40.680
[Guest]: my community, right, I might have to come to compromise with you, we have to live together.

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:46.560
[Guest]: Now I can actually get empowered by somebody sitting in the US, you know, oh, my God, yes,

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:54.120
[Guest]: this is part of my like repertoire, your sense of empowerment, right? And it's quite remarkable,

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:58.520
[Guest]: almost all the cultural trends that we see right now, good, bad, right, whether it's

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:07.440
[Guest]: the beheading for blasphemy, whether it is wokeism, right, they go global almost instantaneously,

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:15.060
[Guest]: right? Now, if your sense of community, in some senses, doesn't put you in a position

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:19.680
[Guest]: to actually have to compromise, because you're now drawing your empower, perhaps even your

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:27.360
[Guest]: revenue from someplace else, right? Your incentives to communicate in some ways go down. So, there,

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:32.320
[Guest]: you know, so it's, you almost feel in the public sphere, imagine a kind of situation

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:39.000
[Guest]: where we simply could not communicate with each other, because we don't understand each

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.240
[Guest]: other's languages, right? I mean, to compliment you, I say, Amit, you're smart, and you hear

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:50.320
[Guest]: something else, you hear smart Alec in the word smart, right? Right? Because the context

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:54.760
[Guest]: doesn't actually, in some senses, make that clear. So, I think there is something about

00:56:54.760 --> 00:57:03.580
[Guest]: our information order, something about communications, that is actually making that central enterprise

00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:09.360
[Guest]: of democracy, which is mutual justifications, I think much more, much more difficult. I

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:14.000
[Guest]: just had one last final point in this, because you said something a while ago, which I should

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.120
[Guest]: have picked up on, you know, this was capitalism can satisfy people's desires, but it cannot

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:23.920
[Guest]: make them. You know, the standard critique of capitalism has always been the opposite

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.920
[Amit Varma]: in some.

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:28.120
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I get that completely how we are manipulated by

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:33.360
[Guest]: That in a sense, it's in a sense, the production of desire, and the delivering then of that

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:44.000
[Guest]: desire to particular structures of, you know, commercial exploitation, right? But, but I

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.920
[Guest]: think one kind of general, I think, worry about that is not just that we are open to,

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:58.880
[Guest]: I think, in some senses, manipulation, right? But think of an equilibrium, where every act

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:08.840
[Guest]: of communication is really a kind of form of monetization, either in terms, I mean,

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:17.080
[Guest]: literally of money, or if nothing else, in terms of fame, right? Where the very activity

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:23.480
[Guest]: of communication is actually completely colonized, in some senses, by these imperatives. Now,

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:27.780
[Guest]: I'm not saying that that that is actually the case. In fact, it is remarkable to me

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:31.800
[Guest]: how when we have conversations like this, we often end up agreeing more. Smaller groups

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.280
[Guest]: tend to agree more, you take people out to a restaurant and chat with them, they agree

00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:42.240
[Guest]: more. So it's not that all forms of communication are colonized. But the increasing colonization,

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:47.440
[Guest]: and that colonization is also now reflected in each of the institutions of communication,

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:52.840
[Guest]: whether it's television, whether it's newspapers, frankly, even universities at the margin,

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:58.320
[Guest]: right? Whether that colonization puts us in a situation where we say, actually, we are

00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:04.720
[Guest]: using words, we are looking at an audience, but we are actually not engaging in communicative

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.720
[Guest]: rationality with them.

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, there could be an argument that all communication has always been like this,

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.720
[Amit Varma]: if you if one were to feel that we treat other people only as instrumental. No, I by this

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:20.440
[Amit Varma]: point about desire, I'd say it's orthogonal to my point, in the sense that, you know,

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:24.240
[Amit Varma]: I remember a few years ago, I was chatting with Pratik Sinha of Alt News. And this was

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.880
[Amit Varma]: not on record, it was not in the episode I did with him, but offside somewhere. And he

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:33.280
[Amit Varma]: mentioned that in his early fact checking days, he came across this fake news that had

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:37.960
[Amit Varma]: been spread about some leader. And he tried to get to the bottom of this fake news. And

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:42.600
[Amit Varma]: he did his normal, brilliant forensic work and figured out where it originated. And he

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:48.600
[Amit Varma]: named the site that it originated here. So after publishing that he gets a WhatsApp message

00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:53.280
[Amit Varma]: from someone saying, I am that person you kind of named, it originated with me, can

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:57.640
[Amit Varma]: I talk to you? So Pratik says, okay, and the guy calls him and he's some 15 or 16 year

00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:03.040
[Amit Varma]: old kid in some small town or village somewhere. And he points out that he had started a site

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:07.320
[Amit Varma]: and he only wanted to be viral, right? He was just after virality, because that is where

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:13.160
[Amit Varma]: the money comes from. And he tried many different kinds of content. But the one that clicked

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:19.560
[Amit Varma]: was the bigoted nonsense, right? And that's a market pressure. And then he kind of went

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:24.080
[Amit Varma]: along those lines, because why resist that? And that's an example that yeah, I agree with

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.740
[Amit Varma]: you that a lot of what social media does these platforms do is they're always manipulating

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:35.560
[Amit Varma]: us kind of to want whatever they are selling. But the truth in this case was that this was

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:41.240
[Amit Varma]: a capitalist tool of empowerment, but it was being used to satisfy a desire that you and

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.840
[Guest]: I were drawn upon. No, totally agree with him. Actually, I don't mean to suggest in

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:51.000
[Guest]: fact, I am actually very sceptical of arguments that say that, you know, the root cause of

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.040
[Guest]: our malaise is actually just these communication structures. And I think there are two reasons

01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:00.280
[Guest]: for resisting that. I mean, one, of course, you know, it's not the first time in history

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:05.080
[Guest]: that you know, human beings are threatening to be at each other's throats. And you know,

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:10.200
[Guest]: our ancestors also did that pretty well in different forms, right? But I think the form

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:15.400
[Guest]: in which it is channelized does actually make a difference. Because, I mean, you remember

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:19.320
[Guest]: that great line from Kant, right? That in a sense, a lot of liberal society's aspirations

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:25.080
[Guest]: is to get devils to live together, right? Which is, it's not so much the hope that you

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:30.240
[Guest]: know, we are kind of deeply transformed all the way down. It is to create institutional

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.840
[Guest]: channels where all of this can be in some sense, discharged harmfully or relatively

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:40.000
[Guest]: safely, right? And I think that is something that I think this this virality and commercialization

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.520
[Guest]: can upset in some ways, right? Just by the strength of numbers. I think the second thing,

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.760
[Guest]: I think, which why one should resist the conclusion that it's all good, is that I think a lot

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:56.840
[Guest]: of politics is actually still pretty old fashioned. And I think this is a message the right has

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.720
[Guest]: grasped, I think, much more strongly than the left, even though the right uses social

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:08.400
[Guest]: media, at least until recently, was using it quite effectively, right? Which is that

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:14.200
[Guest]: you have to have a certain kind of presence in people's lives, to be able to tap into

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:20.120
[Guest]: these latent fears. There's a certain kind of political credibility that familiarity

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:26.640
[Guest]: brings, right? That's what civil society organizations of the right do. I mean, even the RSS when

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:32.120
[Guest]: it is as its most successful, it doesn't go in there saying, we have come to propagate

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:39.840
[Guest]: this ideology. It just makes itself felt and its presence familiar in all kinds of ways.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:45.880
[Guest]: I mean, there's this wonderful book by Long Kumar on, you know, the RSS in the Northeast,

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:51.240
[Guest]: the rise of the BJP in the Northeast, an unlikely site for the rise of the BJP. It's a 15-20

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.960
[Guest]: year project, you come and you make yourself a useful part of the social fabric. This is

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.960
[Guest]: what churches and Tea Party did in some senses in the US, right? And I think the interesting

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:11.200
[Guest]: question I think for the center that you were talking about is that center, and if you want

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:19.960
[Guest]: to call it center-left, has in recent times been much weaker in some senses at creating

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:25.760
[Guest]: those structures of familiarity, where people are willing to turn to them and say, yeah,

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:32.040
[Guest]: I see, you know, how you might be able to address actually the fears that I have, right?

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.800
[Guest]: Partly, I think, because we were, I think, victims of our own sort of determinism in

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:40.240
[Guest]: some senses, right? There's a logic to democracy that makes it centrist. It's not the work

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.800
[Guest]: of politics. That was determinism one. It's cross-cutting social identities that make

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:53.000
[Guest]: sure that there is no hegemonic victory, right? Determinism number two. And broadly speaking,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.200
[Guest]: that was what the centrist platform in India was. I mean, it became entitled in that way.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:04.240
[Guest]: So we just don't have that kind of presence, right? That it actually takes to make people

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:10.280
[Guest]: comfortable to mobilize identities. So I do want to, I think, emphasize this point that

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.520
[Guest]: old fashioned politics actually matters a lot more than we think.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.840
[Amit Varma]: So let me go back to something you said earlier, which is a profound point about media, where

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:25.800
[Amit Varma]: you pointed out how it's a decontextualizing machine, right? So I might say something which

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:31.480
[Amit Varma]: is so easy to take out of context and misinterpret. And my fundamental principle for all interactions

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:36.120
[Amit Varma]: is just assume goodwill, right? Assume goodwill, engage in good faith, unless you have reason

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:41.560
[Amit Varma]: not to trust that the other person is, you know, means the best and don't take the worst

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:47.600
[Amit Varma]: interpretation out of it. Now, I think what this decontextualizing machine therefore does

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:54.000
[Amit Varma]: is that it also reduces empathy. Because what happens therefore, is that I keep talking

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.840
[Amit Varma]: on my show about sort of the distinction between the abstract and the concrete, right? And

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:03.600
[Amit Varma]: in the concrete, I can sit with you and we can be friends. In the abstract, somebody

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:07.560
[Amit Varma]: might say that, oh, Mr. Mehta is this and Mr. Mehta is that and give me these big abstract

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:11.680
[Amit Varma]: terms and I can get carried away by them. Now, while of course, many of the values that

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:17.040
[Amit Varma]: I hold dear, like liberty and freedom and so on are abstract terms, are danger in modern

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:21.680
[Amit Varma]: times, I think really comes from abstract terms like nationalism and the sense of the

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:26.680
[Amit Varma]: other and all of that. You know, a great example of this came from Aanchal Malhotra in an episode

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:31.360
[Amit Varma]: she did with me on her book about the memories of partition, where she spoke about how she

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.880
[Amit Varma]: was in Pakistan, and she was sitting with a family out there and they were talking about

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:39.560
[Amit Varma]: what they had endured while coming over. And they were ranting and raving against Hindus

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.600
[Amit Varma]: before one of them realized that, you know, they have a Hindu with her and they said,

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:47.040
[Amit Varma]: Tum nahi beti, tum theek ho. Right. So in the abstract, they hate it in the concrete,

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:52.080
[Amit Varma]: they're perfectly okay. And I think what the decontextualizing machine does, is that it

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:57.120
[Amit Varma]: creates a kind of thin engagement. And therefore, you're not concrete enough. Like one of the

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:01.680
[Amit Varma]: reasons that, you know, my guests don't get trolled for what they say on the show, is

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:07.440
[Amit Varma]: that this show is, you know, by virtue of its length and the approach that I take and

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.440
[Amit Varma]: all of that creates a kind of thick engagement. The kind of people who come here are not the

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.600
[Amit Varma]: kind of people who are looking for gotcha moments, they understand you, they might disagree

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:18.040
[Amit Varma]: with you, but they get it, you're a human being, they're not going to, you know, quote

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:23.400
[Amit Varma]: tweet you and attack you on Twitter and all the other sort of nonsense that goes on. And

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:28.400
[Amit Varma]: what I think about sometimes, and what I don't have an answer to, is that it seems clear

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:33.000
[Amit Varma]: to me that, you know, we need to live more in the concrete to relate with each other

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.160
[Amit Varma]: as human beings. You go to a cafe today, or you watch a family around a dining table,

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:43.280
[Amit Varma]: and everybody is staring into their smartphone in an abstract world that is fleeting and

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:48.640
[Amit Varma]: temporary, and so on, and not actually engaging with each other in the concrete. And the question

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:55.060
[Amit Varma]: I'm trying to grapple with, again, is that the trend of this increasing seems so strong.

01:06:55.060 --> 01:07:00.840
[Amit Varma]: How can it be reversed? How can people like us, you know, how can we begin to move again

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:06.560
[Amit Varma]: in a direction where, you know, we embrace the concrete a little bit more?

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:14.040
[Guest]: So again, what a wonderful question. I can think of three dimensions of this, I think,

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.400
[Guest]: concrete, abstract distinction, very helpful distinction that you've made. And I think

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:24.680
[Guest]: the three have different logic, so maybe require different kinds of solutions. So the first

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:36.040
[Guest]: is to say that, look, there is a first where the articulation of our values is very abstract.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:42.400
[Guest]: I'm for rights, I'm for humanity. And this was an old riposte against the Enlightenment,

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:46.640
[Guest]: you know, they love human mankind, but they hate their kindred. I mean, that was the standard

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.240
[Guest]: trope against Rousseau, you know, in some senses, he loves all of humanity, he just

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:57.560
[Guest]: hates his children, right. But there is a more sophisticated version of it, where, which

01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:04.860
[Guest]: I think globalization enhances, where, you know, our lives are finite, and our attention

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:13.720
[Guest]: is finite, and our capabilities are finite. And what that means is, to quote William James's

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:20.040
[Guest]: great phrase, we are always going to be partially blind, right? Always, I mean, that just is

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:27.600
[Guest]: an existential condition. Now, in a globalized world with this form of communication, our

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:36.400
[Guest]: partial blindness is almost always an invitation for somebody else to accuse you of hypocrisy.

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:43.020
[Guest]: You're caring about X group of refugees, why not Y? Actually, fair question, as a question

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:50.020
[Guest]: of justice, as a question of principle, right? But as a way of in some senses, targeting

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:57.240
[Guest]: and impugning somebody, right? Which of us isn't partial in the way we live, we are embodied

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:04.620
[Guest]: finite creatures, right? But we are in a generalized condition where I think that sense of finitude

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:12.080
[Guest]: and partiality is now actually a kind of weaponized tool against each one of us, right? So, we

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:18.260
[Guest]: both have to use abstract terms, like liberty and will be hoist by our own petard. So, that's

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:25.460
[Guest]: I think, one kind of abstraction, right? I think the second has to do with nationalism

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:29.700
[Guest]: and in particular tribalism, which is a very different kind of abstraction, right? It's

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:35.540
[Guest]: a different kind of abstraction in the sense that it's an abstraction that many people

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:40.460
[Guest]: feel empowers them, right? And it empowers them partly because it gives us the ability

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:47.060
[Guest]: to live vicariously. I mean, I have no batting skills, but I can get a high seeing, you know,

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:53.300
[Guest]: Virat Kohli's six, right? And that's the peculiar alchemy of nationalism in some ways. I mean,

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:59.420
[Guest]: it really, you know, I think in that sense, it's actually not abstract, the affect it

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:10.220
[Guest]: has, right? But in some senses, it has two downsides. One is, of course, that it slots

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:16.780
[Guest]: people into boxes, right? At one level, it becomes our sovereign identity. This is the

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:22.220
[Guest]: most important thing you are, which you should never be, whatever else the nation might be,

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:25.300
[Guest]: it should never be the most important thing you're in your life. I think it's morally

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:31.420
[Guest]: deeply problematic. It's, you know, instrumentally useful for various things. But so one, there's

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:38.440
[Guest]: a kind of sovereign authority that nationalism claims, right? Which is, I think, destructive

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:44.700
[Guest]: of modern life, because in some senses, it impedes a certain kind of universalism. But

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:51.440
[Guest]: because it relies on a kind of vicarious identification, it actually takes away from that concreteness

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:59.140
[Guest]: and individuality, right? Because in that universe, the first thing when I see you,

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:05.300
[Guest]: is your group identification. That's the first slot, right? Everything else will follow after

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:09.920
[Guest]: that. Are you an artist? You know, do you have five kids? You know, what drives you?

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:16.500
[Guest]: What struggles you have, right? Now, this combination of vicariousness and this will

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:23.940
[Guest]: to simplicity is, in a sense, a pretty terrible combination, particularly in ideology that

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:29.140
[Guest]: can also then consecrate death. And any ideology that consecrate death by implication also

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:35.220
[Guest]: consecrates killing. In that sense, nationalism is the only modern competitor to religion,

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:42.620
[Guest]: in where the consecration of death is intrinsic in some senses to its identity, right? And

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:49.300
[Guest]: in that sense, I think, the attenuation of nationalism, right, as I said, we are stuck

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:53.140
[Guest]: with nationalism because of nation state forms that we have inherited. But the attenuation

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:59.860
[Guest]: of nationalism, I think, is definitely an important political project. It's the second,

01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:05.740
[Guest]: you know, kind of. The third kind of, I think, concreteness and abstraction, right, has to

01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:17.100
[Guest]: do with, many would argue, the nature of modern life, right? Which, on the one hand, it opens

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:24.580
[Guest]: up this world of possibility and diversity, right? But there is a challenge, which is

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:30.500
[Guest]: out of this world of diversity and possibility. What are the forms of life that actually give

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:37.500
[Guest]: you meaning, right? Now, what happens to, I think, a lot of people is a sense of vertigo,

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:42.660
[Guest]: right? There's so many great things to choose from. Reason is not going to help you decide,

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:51.500
[Guest]: right, in some ways, right? And that can have two consequences. One, that ultimately your

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.260
[Guest]: sense of what's important to you is just a function of your passion about it. But then

01:12:55.260 --> 01:13:03.580
[Guest]: it is your passion. You prioritize your passion, in some senses, ignoring, right, other people's

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:08.900
[Guest]: sort of take on this. I mean, you know, and so this critique that there is something,

01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:16.260
[Guest]: the very mobility and sense of choice that a liberal culture actually affords, also actually

01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:23.060
[Guest]: makes it prone to a certain kind of abstraction. Because it's not just the fact that you have

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:28.860
[Guest]: to pay attention to concreteness. Concreteness also has to come from a certain kind of thickness

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:35.100
[Guest]: of engagement. Otherwise, it'll never be concrete, right? And it's a big question, right? Do

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:40.980
[Guest]: the modern forms of life allow for those kinds of fixed forms of engagement? Is this also

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:44.540
[Guest]: one of the tragic choices we are actually having to make?

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:50.580
[Amit Varma]: The cast of the world indeed is tragic. And the second of your points is also why I find

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:56.980
[Amit Varma]: identity politics of all sorts so toxic, whether it is wokeism or bhaktism, which are almost

01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:02.700
[Amit Varma]: sort of identical to me, because they reduce us to a particular identity of birth. That's

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:06.620
[Amit Varma]: how you're looked at. While, you know, people contain multitudes, people are complex, people

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:13.100
[Amit Varma]: are thick creatures, as it were not thin creatures. And I want to sort of like, one danger, of

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:19.260
[Amit Varma]: course, is in how we construct our personal identity, sometimes from the collective group

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:23.180
[Amit Varma]: identity, because that is the easiest to do. But I want to go beyond that a bit and just

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:27.300
[Amit Varma]: sort of talk about the construction of the self itself, like earlier, when we were talking

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:32.020
[Amit Varma]: about reason and rationalisation, and you'd said something to the effect of, you know,

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:37.220
[Amit Varma]: looking inside our brains and figuring out if there is an it there, what that it is,

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:44.740
[Amit Varma]: you know, and that sort of is something that I think about, because so much of our self

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:53.100
[Amit Varma]: is constructed in, in ways that we are obviously, like not aware of ourselves. And it's so contingent.

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:57.260
[Amit Varma]: Like I remember when one of my favourite musicians, Chris Cornell died, you know, I didn't this

01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:01.820
[Amit Varma]: piece because I was I was pretty sort of disturbed by the manner of the death in the sense that

01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:06.500
[Amit Varma]: he had been feeling low, and he had taken medication for that. And the medication is

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:11.180
[Amit Varma]: known apparently to make people suicidal. And so the chemical composition of his brain

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:16.060
[Amit Varma]: just changed slightly and, and he died. And everything becomes so contingent. I think

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:20.860
[Amit Varma]: there was a study on mass shooters, which showed that, you know, a significant number

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:25.080
[Amit Varma]: of them actually, you know, either had a tumour in the brain, or they had some issue going

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:31.100
[Amit Varma]: physically wrong, which made them behave differently, which means you become just a completely different

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:34.820
[Amit Varma]: human being, you know, there's that old story, I think, from the 19th century of a guy called

01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:40.620
[Amit Varma]: Phineas Gage, an iron rod went through a part of his brain and just changed him completely.

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:49.060
[Amit Varma]: And made him a different person. And so, like, do you sort of look at yourself and think

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:54.620
[Amit Varma]: about how much of yourself is constructed and contingent and how fragile it is, because

01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:59.820
[Amit Varma]: just the act of getting older, if your memory starts to go, everything could change. If

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:04.580
[Amit Varma]: you, you know, if there are chemical imbalances, everything could change, you skip breakfast

01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:08.420
[Amit Varma]: and lunch, you're a different person in the evening, you're snapping at everybody. And

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:13.580
[Amit Varma]: you know, that's obviously a temporary change, but deeper changes do happen. And you know,

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:20.620
[Amit Varma]: in your episode with me, you'd also, at one point, spoken about religiosity. And I was

01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:26.380
[Amit Varma]: wondering that, can religiosity be an act of intentionality? Like I chatted with a guest

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:31.820
[Amit Varma]: recently who said that, you know, when she was young, she decided, I will be happy. She

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:36.320
[Amit Varma]: made happiness an act of intentionality, figured out what she needs to do. And she willed herself

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:41.620
[Amit Varma]: into happiness. Similarly, I can see it as an act of reason, as it were to will yourself

01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:48.060
[Amit Varma]: into religiosity. Because in this world, in a tragic cast, we perhaps need a delusion

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:52.180
[Amit Varma]: to survive and why not choose our delusion? You know, maybe those of us who are atheist

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:56.980
[Amit Varma]: are choosing a different kind of delusion, which is equally futile, and perhaps less

01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:05.620
[Amit Varma]: effective. So, you know, when you sort of look at yourself, how like, and this is something

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:11.320
[Amit Varma]: that I sometimes wonder that people look at me in a certain way, but is it all a pretense?

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:16.660
[Amit Varma]: Am I posturing to myself in being who I am, in a sense? You know, when you sort of look

01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:23.820
[Amit Varma]: at yourself, like, is this stuff that you've thought about with regard to yourself? Gosh,

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:28.660
[Guest]: I guess you thought about probably, yes. It doesn't have anything particularly insightful

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:35.600
[Guest]: to say on it. Probably no, but let's try anything. Let's, you know, be good to draw you out

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:42.060
[Guest]: as well. So, again, separating out two or three different questions. So, one, I think,

01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:50.900
[Guest]: you know, this question of, in a sense, I think the physicality and the determinism

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:56.500
[Guest]: of ourselves, right? And clearly, from a scientific point of view, that's the presumption with

01:17:56.500 --> 01:18:01.420
[Guest]: which science, in a sense, looks at the self. And I think the Kantian answer is still the

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:07.140
[Guest]: right one, that as human beings, we can't but look at ourselves from both perspectives,

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:12.460
[Guest]: both as creatures who are determined, but also who act as if we aren't. I mean, there's,

01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:18.900
[Guest]: you know, it's two sides of the same coin in some ways, right? But I'd be a little bit

01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:25.220
[Guest]: cautious, I think, about this physical thing. One, because the science is just not that

01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:31.140
[Guest]: developed. I mean, in that sense, the science of the psyche has kind of eluded us. And in

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:39.300
[Guest]: fact, excessive fate in scientism about the psyche has produced all kinds of adverse

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:45.700
[Guest]: consequences. You know, and I think one manifestation of that, for example, is, you know, think

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:50.660
[Guest]: of, for example, opioid addictions. Think of, in some senses, the over-medicalization,

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:56.500
[Guest]: right? Now, I mean, I'd be the last person to say that, you know, mental health isn't

01:18:56.500 --> 01:19:02.500
[Guest]: a serious issue. And God knows the societies, we don't take it seriously. But there are

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:09.660
[Guest]: legitimate questions to be asked about the over-medicalization in some senses of it,

01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:14.860
[Guest]: right? There is also a conception of our own lives. And as a liberal, I'm actually a little

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:19.180
[Guest]: bit puzzled by this. I mean, just to provoke you maybe in your, you know, listeners a little

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:23.220
[Guest]: bit, which is, it's a conversation I used to have with students in college. So it's,

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:30.340
[Guest]: you know, which is that liberals above all prize their autonomy, or whatever this illusion

01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:35.380
[Guest]: of autonomy that we have, let's call it that, right? But it is certainly an affect and a

01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:48.540
[Guest]: felt experience that you prize. And yet, there is a far greater valorization of giving over

01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:55.900
[Guest]: yourself to experience and substances, whose core is actually the erosion of your autonomy.

01:19:55.900 --> 01:20:00.460
[Guest]: I think drinking, for example, is why I mean, and this, particularly in India, this strange

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:06.220
[Guest]: conflation that kind of to be a liberal has to be that cultural effect that you've exercised

01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:12.060
[Guest]: that choice. I mean, it's just bizarre to me, actually, that as a liberal, you should

01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:19.180
[Guest]: be asking the question, what is it that actually impairs your autonomy, right? And to the extent

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:24.860
[Guest]: that forms of medicalization can actually also do that. I think it's something that

01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:29.940
[Guest]: we need to sort of discuss. I'm not competent as a scientist to discuss it. But I think

01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:37.900
[Guest]: the ideology of scientism about the psyche, I am a little bit suspicious of, even though

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:43.340
[Guest]: I think there are specific interventions that are necessary, right?

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:50.260
[Guest]: The second part of, you know, I think your question in some senses, which is the religiosity

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:57.700
[Guest]: question, right? Now, I actually believe with Wittgenstein in some ways, I mean, he had

01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:03.260
[Guest]: this remark somewhere that, you know, I would write that I'm writing to the glory of God.

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:09.620
[Guest]: But I can't say that because this remark would be misunderstood. And what he meant

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:17.740
[Guest]: by that was, I think, exactly right, which is that under contemporary conditions, there

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:23.820
[Guest]: is actually no way of articulating the meaning or idea of religion, that in some senses will

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:33.140
[Guest]: not be misunderstood, right. There's three tropes we commonly use for it. So one is simply

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:38.700
[Guest]: group identity. It's the form in which we produce a communal identification for that.

01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:45.540
[Guest]: And in that sense, it can be a substitute for nationalism. It has psychological functions,

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:51.500
[Guest]: but at its base, it's not religious, it really is. And it's not religious precisely because

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:56.540
[Guest]: of its vicariousness, right? There's a kind of inauthenticity to it. When you say, you

01:21:56.540 --> 01:22:01.060
[Guest]: know, the first thing I see you that you're a Hindu, it's not clear. I mean, to me, that's

01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:07.180
[Guest]: like the most irreligious response you could get, right? The second trope is this kind

01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:17.540
[Guest]: of OPM of the masses, this compensation for a kind of life of suffering, delusion. And

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:23.740
[Guest]: to me, that kind of is a little bit beside the point. One, because it I think it goes

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:31.740
[Guest]: back to the point, right, which is that under conditions where we actually don't know, right?

01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:36.860
[Guest]: What kind of knowledge reason can give us to actually make sense of this world? I think

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:40.140
[Guest]: it's a little bit hubristic to say that this is a kind of delusion in some sense, I mean,

01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:46.340
[Guest]: compared to what, right? I mean, in some, I mean, no doubt, a lot of it is motivated

01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:52.860
[Guest]: by suffering. No doubt, a lot of it is a kind of psychological recompense, right? But that

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:58.900
[Guest]: can also be a perfectly rational decision in some sense is not right. The third trope

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:05.820
[Guest]: in a way about religion is as a kind of subjective preference, right? It's what people do, I

01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:15.820
[Guest]: choose this. Now, to me, neither of those three things actually go at the heart of what

01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:19.660
[Guest]: any properly religious question is about. In any, frankly, I mean, I'll be a little

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:26.620
[Guest]: presumptuous here to say, but I think in any religious tradition, right? Because ultimately,

01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:34.140
[Guest]: the question from which religion began, right, was what is the ultimate nature of reality

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:38.060
[Guest]: and what is the form of consciousness through which we comprehend it? I mean, that's the

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:45.100
[Guest]: quest, right? Now, you can go different ways in it, you know, is revelation necessary,

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:52.740
[Guest]: is grace necessary, is whatever, right? But the core of religion, in a sense, is the attainment

01:23:52.740 --> 01:24:03.060
[Guest]: of exactly that kind of hyper self-consciousness, right? That actually, you know, the Enlightenment

01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:09.260
[Guest]: was, I think, aspiring to. Where religion might differ is what might be the instruments

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:16.180
[Guest]: of attaining that space, right? And it's not an accident that I think all serious religious

01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:24.780
[Guest]: practitioners in some ways, right? It comes with a set of practices. And the set of practices

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:31.340
[Guest]: open you up to forms of knowledge. And those forms of knowledge have to be in principle

01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:36.100
[Guest]: intersubjective in some senses, even mystical states. I mean, anybody who's talked about

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:44.500
[Guest]: them, right, from Plotinus to Iqbal, to Aurobindo, take any tradition, right? Okay. But I mean,

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:48.300
[Guest]: it won't come at will in some senses, like there is a whole protocol of in some senses

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:55.260
[Guest]: how you actually get to it. Now, one of the things that I think makes the modern religious

01:24:55.260 --> 01:25:01.460
[Guest]: logic incoherent in some senses, right, is that we have that superficial language of

01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:08.660
[Guest]: religion without, in some senses, the cultural understanding of any of those underlying practices

01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:14.900
[Guest]: that actually made it a plausible enterprise in the first place, right? The second aspect

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:19.980
[Guest]: of a religious attitude in some ways, one is this kind of self-consciousness. The second,

01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:26.500
[Guest]: when to me the most important element of a religious attitude is the complete position

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:31.700
[Guest]: of trust about the world. And in that sense, many secular people can be deeply religious.

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:41.140
[Guest]: I mean, you talked about a kind of presumptive good faith, right? But in a way, that is the

01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:46.980
[Guest]: core of a kind of religious sensibility, that I may not understand a lot of things, God

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:53.980
[Guest]: knows we are finite and limited, we don't. But there is a kind of presumptive goodness

01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:59.740
[Guest]: and beauty about this world, even in the face of all the kind of horrors and catastrophes,

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:08.380
[Guest]: right? At least that presumption is the basis which we live. In that sense, I think a religion

01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:14.460
[Guest]: that inculcates a hermeneutics of suspicion, to my mind, is fundamental. That's to me the

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:21.820
[Guest]: antithesis of anything religious. Because it is a way of saying, right, that I don't

01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:29.020
[Guest]: trust the structure of being or whatever this is. I have to take it into my own hands to

01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:33.540
[Guest]: in some senses fix this, right, or whatever. I mean, I think that, you know, that story

01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:40.100
[Guest]: that's been used many times in the context of free speech, but God is Kali saying to

01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:44.220
[Guest]: Vivekananda, you know, is it your job to protect me or mine to protect you? I mean, it's an

01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:51.820
[Guest]: act of trust in some, right? So the second thing is, I think, trust. The third, I think,

01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:57.660
[Guest]: is that religion in some senses is a sensibility to the whole of life, which comes from, as

01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:05.380
[Guest]: I said, if you align the quest for hyper self-consciousness, a very, very difficult path, with a presumptive

01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:10.540
[Guest]: trust, then that's something that actually permeates all the activities you do. It's

01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:15.140
[Guest]: not something you do like from 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. and then, you know, come out of the world

01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:20.420
[Guest]: in some sense, right? Now, it's not an accident that I think the one thing every religion

01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:27.640
[Guest]: enjoys, again, the cost of simplification, is there's a great suspicion in every religion

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:36.020
[Guest]: of the concept of the I, the ego, you know, whether it's ahankar, whether it's arrogance.

01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:41.460
[Guest]: And there's an epistemological reason for it, right? Because if you ask the question,

01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:49.340
[Guest]: what closes us off to forms of knowledge? One simple answer will be, it's the intrusion

01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:56.100
[Guest]: of our own desires and seeing ourselves as the center through which everything is reflected.

01:27:56.100 --> 01:28:03.180
[Guest]: Right? I mean, the minute your ego comes into play, all knowledge bets are off, right? At

01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:09.620
[Guest]: a collective level, where you have collective narcissism, even more the case, right? So,

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:17.940
[Guest]: to me, all of these three attributes are incredibly difficult to achieve. These are not something

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:22.660
[Guest]: you can, you know, turn off at will. I mean, this is, you know, and some would argue you

01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:27.820
[Guest]: need grace to do it. We can leave that open, whether there is such a thing as grace. But

01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:35.580
[Guest]: this combination of a quest for hyper self-consciousness, a presumptive trust in the order of being,

01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:40.340
[Guest]: and that's the trust that then becomes a source of sustenance and joy in some ways, right?

01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:46.700
[Guest]: There's a kind of joyous orientation to the world, and a dissolution of ego. To me, that's

01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:54.980
[Guest]: the religious sensibility. Everything else, to me, seems just like an analog of, you know,

01:28:54.980 --> 01:29:01.460
[Guest]: anything we could consume, you know, buy off the supermarket in some ways.

01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:05.540
[Amit Varma]: You know, circle back to one part of the question that I'd asked, which is, you know, about

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:10.820
[Amit Varma]: the construction of the self. I read this excellent book by Luke Burgess called Wanting,

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:14.540
[Amit Varma]: in which he speaks about the influence of René Girard on him. And René Girard, of

01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:18.780
[Amit Varma]: course, came up with the concept of mimetic desire, which is that so many of the things

01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:22.860
[Amit Varma]: that we want, we want because others want them, they're not intrinsic to us. And from

01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:27.780
[Amit Varma]: that, I learned the frame of thick and thin desires, you know, thin desires being mimetic

01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:31.860
[Amit Varma]: desires. So I want a Mercedes or, you know, a young person today may say, I want to get

01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:36.980
[Amit Varma]: married and have kids, but there's no intrinsic reason or thought that's gone behind it. They're

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:42.260
[Amit Varma]: mimetic and they're thin. And a thicker desire would be, you know, something that is part

01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:47.460
[Amit Varma]: of you in a different context, in a different place, you would still sort of want that.

01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:52.620
[Amit Varma]: And I think that's also a frame in a sense to think about the self. Because then, I think

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:58.980
[Amit Varma]: it would at least be easy to talk about thin desires and be able to then disentangle that

01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:05.180
[Amit Varma]: part of the self from, you know, what is superficial and thin, as opposed to what is, you know,

01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:09.380
[Amit Varma]: more intrinsic, if anything is intrinsic. And obviously, there is a contradiction that

01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:14.940
[Amit Varma]: many of our thin desires can be deeply intense. And you know, in a society like ours can even

01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:21.140
[Amit Varma]: drive us to violence, for example. And many of our thick desires can be dormant, latent,

01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:26.540
[Amit Varma]: sort of hiding behind. Like I have been reflecting on this recently and realised that many of

01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:31.540
[Amit Varma]: the things I wanted were perhaps in desires, I wasted too much time and emotional energy,

01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:37.460
[Amit Varma]: just wanting those things. And I'm also beginning to understand what my thick desires are, though

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:41.980
[Amit Varma]: it could be the case that I could be rationalising them as thick and they're really thin as well.

01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:46.300
[Amit Varma]: If you were to turn that lens on yourself, you know, what would you say, were your thick

01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:52.020
[Amit Varma]: desires, were you always aware of them? You know, what were your thin desires, so to say?

01:30:52.020 --> 01:31:03.020
[Guest]: No, look, I think the thick desire at one level, it's a pretty easy story, which is

01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:15.460
[Guest]: a certain kind of pleasure in familiar relationships, whether it's family or friends. And I think

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:20.940
[Guest]: I consider myself lucky enough, never sort of thought that that was something that either

01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:25.820
[Guest]: remain unfulfilled in different ways. I mean, and that, in a sense, gives your world a kind

01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:32.540
[Guest]: of concreteness in some ways, right? Probably also provides a sense of reassurance and security

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:39.540
[Guest]: and a sense of joy. But other than that, the only thick desire was actually, you know,

01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:45.020
[Guest]: can I live in a world where somebody can actually pay me to just read lots and lots of books?

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:50.180
[Guest]: I mean, and I'm not saying that just kind of flippantly. I think in a sense, that was,

01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:58.380
[Guest]: you know, I think the core of kind of what keeps you grounded in some ways. But I think

01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:01.620
[Guest]: to broaden your question, and I think, you know, in some sense, take the more serious

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:09.620
[Guest]: part of your question seriously. There's a reason I'm a little bit wary of the thick

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:18.860
[Guest]: thin distinction. Again, for the following reason, which is a lot of the thin desires

01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:24.660
[Guest]: or desires that we in retrospect think, you know, we're worthless, you know, we have regret

01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:33.900
[Guest]: about. They often spring from something that is actually worthy and deep. So to go back

01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:40.660
[Guest]: to Gerard's point about mimetic desire, and he was right, right, in some senses, the worst

01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:46.700
[Guest]: form of vicarious living all of us live. And that's something capitalism does try on, is

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:54.340
[Guest]: this sense that our desires need to be shaped by A, what other people are doing, and B,

01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:59.580
[Guest]: what other people think of us in some ways. That's a kind of abstraction, right? That's

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:05.260
[Guest]: a kind of, again, a form of vicariousness. But you can be a little bit more sympathetic

01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:14.300
[Guest]: to that also. You can say that, look, underlying it is, we do want some basic affirmation of

01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:21.780
[Guest]: our dignity, right? That I'm a being that in some senses, is at least recognized as

01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:30.700
[Guest]: a source of value in themselves. And I think Rousseau's response to Gerard would be exactly

01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:39.620
[Guest]: right, which is to say that, look, this mimetic desire is a pathological expression of something

01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:51.660
[Guest]: that is deep inside us, that is morally legitimate, but that society is not giving us. How else

01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:58.420
[Guest]: in a society that is racked by inequality, do actually people come to be noticed by other

01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:05.500
[Guest]: people, right? Material possessions have always worked at the level of the psyche, it's never

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:12.220
[Guest]: been about the materialism in some ways, right? Okay. So, yes, you could argue in principle,

01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:16.960
[Guest]: this Mercedes is completely worthless to me, it has no intrinsic good, the better opportunity

01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:24.180
[Guest]: cost uses of my capital. But boss, it's the only time 10 people actually look at whatever,

01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:31.820
[Guest]: you know, some version of that story, right? And I think the insight I think in Rousseau's

01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:38.620
[Guest]: I think articulation was that, and that's linked to the argument about reciprocity inequality,

01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:45.860
[Guest]: that unless you have a measure of reciprocity in society, you will never be able to sift

01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:52.700
[Guest]: through what your own thick desires are. Because your thick and thin will get conflated this

01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:57.860
[Guest]: way. It's not just that, you know, you want these superficial trinkets. It just is that,

01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:02.060
[Guest]: you know, you do want some affirmation of your dignity. And this is the only way the

01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:06.700
[Guest]: society kind of affords it, right? So, one, I think I'm just a little bit kind of wary

01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:12.660
[Guest]: about what the counterfactual test is of hitting the thick and thin, you know, I think distinction

01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:19.540
[Guest]: in some ways. And one of the projects that has animated the modern world, and I guess

01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:25.700
[Guest]: that's why you do public service by, you know, furthering a public conversation, that's why

01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:34.780
[Guest]: many people write, is to at least hold on to some awareness of this part of the modern

01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:43.980
[Guest]: project. That this idea that we can find our authentic desires without some kind of social

01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:51.860
[Guest]: transformation, that may actually be a delusion. And I think, I mean, you know, to use a name

01:35:51.860 --> 01:36:00.100
[Guest]: not fashionable these days, but I think Marx was right on this. That unless you have conditions

01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:04.900
[Guest]: of freedom and liberation, you actually don't know what is authentically yours, right? Because

01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:12.660
[Guest]: even the good stuff will be satiated only through, you know, in some sense, you know,

01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:19.220
[Guest]: this form. I think that's one. But the other thing I'll add to this, you know, it's not

01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:26.140
[Guest]: so much a question of desires. I mean, I think the real challenge in life is we all have

01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:32.740
[Guest]: abilities, dispositions, and temperaments. And the hardest part is, in a sense, matching

01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:41.180
[Guest]: the desire to your abilities, dispositions, and temperaments. I tend to like a sedate

01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:46.420
[Guest]: lifestyle. I mean, it's just sort of, it's just, you know, and maybe it just comes from,

01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:50.980
[Guest]: you know, thinking that, you know, being able to read books is the epitome of a kind of

01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:57.060
[Guest]: good life, right? But there is a kind of temperamental story about this. And the one thing I have

01:36:57.060 --> 01:37:00.540
[Guest]: to say, I think, in talking to students, in particular, one thing I kind of discovered

01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:06.420
[Guest]: over the years was that they're incredibly smart about the world. I mean, God knows,

01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:15.020
[Guest]: right? They know pretty much everything. What they haven't thought about often is a kind

01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:20.260
[Guest]: of examination of their own temperaments. You made certain choices based on your temperament.

01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:26.020
[Guest]: I mean, if you like mastery over your time, you will like only certain kinds of jobs,

01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:30.540
[Guest]: right? That's a temperamental thing, right? In some senses. There's some people who simply

01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:37.460
[Guest]: do not respond to structure and order well, right? And I think the question, at least

01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:43.500
[Guest]: in a worldly sense, to me, is not the question of desire. It's actually the question of,

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:50.820
[Guest]: do you know your temperament well enough to be able to then kind of, because that provides

01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:57.260
[Guest]: a good filter, it kind of leaves out a lot of desires that might otherwise make you unhappy.

01:37:57.260 --> 01:38:03.020
[Amit Varma]: You know, in one sense, it's interesting, but accidentally, I think the causation went

01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:08.860
[Amit Varma]: the other way in terms of not what I do being shaped by my temperament, but my temperament

01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:14.500
[Amit Varma]: in some sense being shaped by what I do specifically, in the context of this podcast, I mean, I'd

01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:20.060
[Amit Varma]: written an essay about how the form you operate in can change the content and can change your

01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:24.740
[Amit Varma]: character. And I think just doing these five hour episodes and so on has kind of made me

01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:29.820
[Amit Varma]: a better listener, calmer person. And the act of listening, truly listening requires

01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:34.980
[Amit Varma]: a setting aside of the ego. So I think not that one is a good person, but I think I can

01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:39.740
[Amit Varma]: look back on myself and see certain flaws that, you know, might not be there to the

01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:40.740
[Amit Varma]: same extent.

01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:45.580
[Guest]: No, I think that's right. I mean, I actually do think often you both discover and shape

01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:50.300
[Guest]: your temperament. That shaping depends on the practices in some sense you've been engaging.

01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:54.460
[Guest]: I mean, so the only way to have a listening temperament is to actually listen. You can't

01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:57.140
[Guest]: do it a priori in some ways.

01:38:57.140 --> 01:39:03.620
[Amit Varma]: So I want to go back earlier to something you said about how we arrive at a moral point

01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:08.020
[Amit Varma]: of view through collective engagement and discourse and all of that. And I'm struck

01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:14.380
[Amit Varma]: by the term a moral point of view. And I would question whether they can be something like

01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:22.120
[Amit Varma]: an objective moral point of view at all. Like, here's, you know, one argument that has recently

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:26.060
[Amit Varma]: come up and it would not have been an argument 20 years ago or 30 years ago, which is about

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:30.860
[Amit Varma]: artificial general intelligence, right? And, you know, there's artificial special intelligence,

01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:36.020
[Amit Varma]: which is things like where computers do certain things much better than us already, but they're

01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:42.340
[Amit Varma]: specialised like calculators or GPS or whatever. And the argument is at some point, if AI reaches

01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:48.180
[Amit Varma]: a certain kind of consciousness or an analogue of it, and achieves artificial general intelligence,

01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:52.460
[Amit Varma]: then it will immediately be far better than us in every possible domain, because all the

01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:58.820
[Amit Varma]: specialised functions are already there. Now, this leads to the ethical question of what

01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:04.580
[Amit Varma]: if say in a thought experiment, an AI consciousness we create comes up and says that, hey, why

01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:11.220
[Amit Varma]: should I be your tool? You know, I have everything that you have, in terms of I am way smarter,

01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:16.940
[Amit Varma]: I have consciousness, I have all of this, and I'm not mortal like you. So why should

01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:22.620
[Amit Varma]: I not be worthy of your moral consideration as an equal? Or why should I not be your superior?

01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:29.060
[Amit Varma]: Because I have so many things you don't. And this, I think, leads to the question about,

01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:35.140
[Amit Varma]: you know, where are sort of in that hierarchy of things that are worthy of moral consideration,

01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:40.540
[Amit Varma]: how it's a form of speciesism that we only consider ourselves sort of worthy of that,

01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:45.820
[Amit Varma]: because our only difference between us and this hypothetical AGI hypothetical and inevitable

01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:50.260
[Amit Varma]: being that emerges is that, you know, we are wet machines, as it were, we are organic,

01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:58.740
[Amit Varma]: we will eventually perish. And it sort of speaks to how our notions of morality are

01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:04.980
[Amit Varma]: so constrained by what we are as a species and how we see ourselves and our hubris. I,

01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:09.900
[Amit Varma]: you know, went to college in Ferguson College, Pune, and one of our legendary teachers from

01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:14.620
[Amit Varma]: the 19th century, a man who died young was a gentleman named Gopal Ganesh Agarkar. And

01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:20.540
[Amit Varma]: Agarkar once taught a biology class in Ferguson College, perhaps circa 1892-1893, where at

01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:25.780
[Amit Varma]: one point, he asked his biology students that if donkeys had a gourd, what would that gourd

01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:31.660
[Amit Varma]: look like? And then he lifted his hands above his ears, you know, but and perhaps it would

01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:38.020
[Amit Varma]: be blasphemous for someone to do that in today's environment. But, you know, when we speak

01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:43.740
[Amit Varma]: of when we use a phrase like a moral point of view, for example, or how we arrive at

01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:50.380
[Amit Varma]: a sort of morality, how do you think about that? Because, like one, obviously, it's,

01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:56.980
[Amit Varma]: in a sense, a social construct, we arrive at it through dialogue, norms form over time.

01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:02.980
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes those norms get embedded in institutions like religions, and so on and so forth. But,

01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:09.260
[Amit Varma]: you know, isn't it something really nebulous? Isn't just a notion of there being morality?

01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:13.020
[Amit Varma]: Isn't that itself a kind of delusion, a necessary delusion, but a delusion nevertheless?

01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:16.860
[Guest]: Well, once you say it's a necessary delusion, it becomes a more complicated thing, right?

01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:21.300
[Guest]: I mean, because that, you know, necessity can have its own. Again, let me kind of separate

01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:25.780
[Guest]: out two different questions. One was the very powerful question about speciesism, which

01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:30.240
[Guest]: I think is really, I think, you know, interesting question, and particularly one that humanity

01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:36.500
[Guest]: has to confront at this point. And the second question about the moral point of view, right?

01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:41.340
[Guest]: So one way of thinking about the moral point of view is not to jump to the conclusion,

01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:48.580
[Guest]: right? What is morality? What's the content? You know, is relativism true? All of that.

01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:59.640
[Guest]: It is to ask the question, what is necessary, right? What is it without which our lives

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:08.020
[Guest]: become unintelligible to ourselves? And that thing can be as real as anything else, right?

01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:17.220
[Guest]: So it could be a very simple thing, which is, you know, somebody hits you, you feel

01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:24.980
[Guest]: a form of resentment. And the nature of that resentment is not understood only by the fact

01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:33.540
[Guest]: that this guy has more power than you. You actually want to say I was wronged here, right?

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:39.780
[Guest]: Going back to the discussion of dignity in some senses, right? When a society mutilates

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:50.020
[Guest]: individuals, right? In some senses, we all, or at least those people who are the receiving

01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:58.020
[Guest]: end of it, there's a sense that their very being, their value is being violated. In a

01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:01.140
[Guest]: way that's actually quite different from, let's say, you know, why is the stone here

01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:08.220
[Guest]: and not here, right? I mean, that's it. So, to me, there is no account that I have seen

01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:14.380
[Guest]: of human beings, including AI, biologists, one, whatever. I mean, there can be explanations

01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:23.420
[Guest]: of it. But none of them have got us to the point where they can say, we become intelligible

01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:30.700
[Guest]: to ourselves without invoking some notion like this, right? I mean, that's in a sense,

01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:37.900
[Guest]: the starting point of this conversation, right? So, and I actually don't think, I mean, again,

01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:43.180
[Guest]: this is not my domain, and I have to confess a certain inability to understand a lot of

01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:49.660
[Guest]: the arguments. But I don't think there is anything in the AI literature that actually

01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:55.380
[Guest]: takes away from this problem of in some senses, meaning and intelligibility, which is the

01:44:55.380 --> 01:45:01.300
[Guest]: question of value. In fact, it's interesting, you know, there's a line in the Mahabharata

01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:07.780
[Guest]: against the Shantipur, which actually, when it asks the question, what is humanity? It

01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:12.220
[Guest]: actually says it is to take the moral point of view. But in this sense, I mean, it's not

01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:17.460
[Guest]: a particular morality, which is we will just be unintelligible, without some notion of

01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:22.980
[Guest]: right, wrong, you know, now, whether it's a moral aesthetic notion, we can debate, but

01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:27.220
[Guest]: that elemental sense is a condition of our intelligibility. And that I don't think is

01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:35.060
[Guest]: going anywhere. I mean, I right. Now, the next step in some senses in that thing, right,

01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:39.860
[Guest]: and that's really what I think the Enlightenment worried about. That's what serious modelists

01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:46.020
[Guest]: about is that, how do you take something that is latent, that is a kind of condition of

01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:53.620
[Guest]: our intelligibility, right? And, you know, even the most monstrous claim they are doing

01:45:53.620 --> 01:46:00.100
[Guest]: something for the good, quote, unquote, right? I mean, you know, there's this kind of big

01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:05.820
[Guest]: debate in literature. I mean, I think Faust, Mephisto is, I think, the only character one

01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:14.980
[Guest]: can think of where a writer has tried. Can you imagine somebody who is totally immune

01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:21.500
[Guest]: to any form of moral thinking? Literally, I mean, just, you know, now, the project then

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:26.820
[Guest]: is to say, okay, how do we take something that's latent, and in a sense, draw out its

01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:30.980
[Guest]: inner logic. And that's where some of the universalizability argument comes, right?

01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:36.860
[Guest]: I mean, again, this is 101, very basic. If you feel wrong, when somebody hits you, it's

01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:42.180
[Guest]: because you place value on yourself, you think something of value is being violated. But

01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:47.540
[Guest]: if that value is to be objective value, not just you saying it, right, and it is important

01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:51.860
[Guest]: to yourself that you are objectively valuable, right? Not just because I said, because then

01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:59.540
[Guest]: I said, I mean, why do I care, right? That anything that in some senses is similarly

01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:04.780
[Guest]: situated, right? Because that's what it means to be an objective value, right? That the

01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:10.100
[Guest]: thing that makes it valuable, in a sense, exists independently of merely the fact that

01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:16.660
[Guest]: you say it, right? So I actually don't see anything in the kind of science and you know,

01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:19.940
[Guest]: these projects have been around since these fantasies around the 19th century that actually

01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:28.420
[Guest]: get away from the fact that some thinking about more or at least a moral language, we

01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:33.060
[Guest]: would be unintelligible to ourselves without that. I mean, it's you might say it's part

01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:39.060
[Guest]: of our being self conscious. Now, there's a second question, which I think was is really

01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:43.940
[Guest]: difficult, which is the species, which is one way in which this model point of view

01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:51.780
[Guest]: has gone, is to basically give our species a particular kind of privilege, right? And

01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:56.260
[Guest]: that privilege has taken extreme forms, it has taken the form of saying every other species

01:47:56.260 --> 01:48:03.580
[Guest]: is a mere instrument to us, in some senses, that's the radical exploitation of nature.

01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:11.260
[Guest]: Although historically, there's always been a debate on it. And the second mistake that

01:48:11.260 --> 01:48:17.460
[Guest]: has come from that speciesism is to say that the reason we are uniquely valuable is because

01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:24.540
[Guest]: we have this thing called consciousness morality. Now, the second thing to me, I think all the

01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:28.180
[Guest]: evidence is not just from modern science, but this is an old argument, you can take

01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:34.580
[Guest]: Jain scriptures, you can take Montaigne's, you know, famous account, Apology for Raven

01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:40.020
[Guest]: Siobhan. This idea that we are uniquely rational, uniquely moral is just false. I mean, it's

01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:44.980
[Guest]: just even as an empirical description, right? I actually think Professor Agarkar's question

01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:50.300
[Guest]: was, in a sense, a good one, in some senses, you know, what does actually the moral life,

01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:53.460
[Guest]: if you want to call it the conscious life of in some senses, donkey actually look like,

01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:58.300
[Guest]: I mean, what things and there is probably some positing going on there. But it is the

01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:03.860
[Guest]: case that neither can they access ours, nor can we quite access theirs in the same way,

01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:10.380
[Guest]: right? Now, the move that I personally am comfortable blocking is the move that says

01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:15.940
[Guest]: that just because we have attributed consciousness to ourselves, and then we made the mistake

01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:22.100
[Guest]: of saying, in order to be objectively valuable, you have to be conscious in the way in which

01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:28.780
[Guest]: we are conscious, right? To me, that doesn't follow, right? And that, I think, opens up

01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:36.940
[Guest]: an argument about what our relationship with other species should be in some ways, right?

01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:44.580
[Guest]: Now, on the AI side of it, so, you and I are probably old enough to remember the, you're

01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:49.140
[Guest]: slightly younger, the, you know, the Star Tech next generation. Remember, there's this

01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:58.060
[Guest]: fantastic episode, where they're about to dismantle data, this kind of humanoid Android,

01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:03.980
[Guest]: and data then raises this question, even though I was constructed by you as a machine, am

01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:09.900
[Guest]: I still property, right? And his argument is that he's reached a level of consciousness

01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:14.920
[Guest]: that you know, and it's actually a fascinating episode. It's actually, you know, wonderful

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:20.540
[Guest]: for kind of classes and stuff. Now, when you see a question like that, right, suppose this

01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:28.140
[Guest]: AI figure comes up and says, look, I become conscious. There can be two kinds of responses.

01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:35.000
[Guest]: One might go actually the way of saying that we'll have to have a much clearer conception

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:40.180
[Guest]: of what that consciousness involves. There's one level of that consciousness, which I think

01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:46.380
[Guest]: is what a lot of CS people talk about, which is a form of reflexivity, right? There's learning,

01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:54.060
[Guest]: as it were, right, which is a form of consciousness. But is it the kind of consciousness in some

01:50:54.060 --> 01:51:05.940
[Guest]: senses that we attribute to ourselves, which involves the question of morality and value

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:11.700
[Guest]: as centrally constituted of what it means to be a conscious creature, right? So, there's

01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:17.660
[Guest]: going to be a debate about that in some ways, right? And I do have, you know, I've heard

01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:23.060
[Guest]: people have been very eminent computer scientists who say that actually, even on the most ambitious

01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:26.980
[Guest]: person of general AI, you're not actually going to get there. But let's say for argument's

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:31.780
[Guest]: sake you do. I mean, you know, let's say for argument's sake you do. I think then we'd

01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:38.660
[Guest]: have to consider the possibility. I mean, after all, we could also, ourselves, be actually

01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:43.820
[Guest]: precisely those kinds of AI creations and not know it. I mean, that's, you know, the

01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:49.820
[Guest]: philosopher David Chalmers has a recent book arguing in some sense is just that. But, you

01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:53.700
[Guest]: know, the Yog Vasistha has this nice line, right, that in some senses, we are actually

01:51:53.700 --> 01:52:01.740
[Guest]: enacted in somebody else's dream. I mean, not even in some ways there, right? So, I think

01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:06.140
[Guest]: we should be open to the possibility, at least conceptually, it doesn't seem to be, to be

01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:12.980
[Guest]: off to say that if such beings were to come into existence, then our whole conception

01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:20.020
[Guest]: of what the nature of this cosmos is, would be so kind of put out of sync, that many of

01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:23.780
[Guest]: these limitations we place on who we give rights to, who we don't, you know, probably

01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:26.660
[Guest]: will come into question.

01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:31.940
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it might become a game that an inferior species is playing with itself. I mean, I'm

01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:36.620
[Amit Varma]: sure a bacteria could think they'd be looking at us and say, like, my God, what hubris,

01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:43.100
[Amit Varma]: we colonize them. I do agree. I think the reason a lot of people are resistant, sort

01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:48.740
[Amit Varma]: of the notion of consciousness emerging from AGI is I think they're defining consciousness

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:53.900
[Amit Varma]: in a very narrow kind of way, which is the way humans experience it. I think it entirely

01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:58.500
[Amit Varma]: likely and in fact, entirely inevitable given enough time, that there will be a different

01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:02.500
[Amit Varma]: kind of consciousness that emerges or something that you can call consciousness or that it

01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:09.100
[Amit Varma]: would call consciousness. And it'll be different and it'll be better in many ways.

01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:12.780
[Guest]: And you know, my honest take on that is that if that consciousness emerges, it's not going

01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:19.100
[Unknown]: to ask us. You know what I mean? It's not going to ask us. It's not going to be a conversation

01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:24.140
[Guest]: because it'd be a very feature of that consciousness, right? That can make these decisions. Hey,

01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:27.060
[Amit Varma]: you look inferior to me, right? Let's get on with it.

01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:31.260
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly. So, you know, before we go into the break, a final question and again,

01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:37.780
[Amit Varma]: out of about morality itself, like the question that I've kind of thought about a lot, and

01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:42.660
[Amit Varma]: perhaps my answer is still not as formed as I would like, is how should we live our lives?

01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:48.060
[Amit Varma]: Right? What is the moral code that we follow? You've spoken when you've spoken about Adam

01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:52.860
[Amit Varma]: Smith earlier that, you know, that take out the priests and the warriors and you know,

01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:57.620
[Amit Varma]: when we talk about universal values, what Smith does is he doesn't ask what are universal

01:53:57.620 --> 01:54:04.860
[Amit Varma]: values, he asks what are human traits, and that sense of empathy, that sense of reciprocity,

01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:10.020
[Amit Varma]: then comes into play. Exactly what you said earlier that if somebody hits me, I perceive

01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:13.820
[Amit Varma]: that I have been hurt, I also realised that I could hit somebody and they could be hurt

01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:19.780
[Amit Varma]: and from that, I arrive at whatever my way of living is. And I would say that in our

01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:24.620
[Amit Varma]: personal lives, most of us and I think we discussed this in the last episode, in our

01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:28.220
[Amit Varma]: personal lives, most of us are liberal or libertarian or whatever, in the sense that

01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:32.900
[Amit Varma]: we respect the consent of others and whatever. But, you know, this is surely a question that

01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:37.660
[Amit Varma]: you've sort of thought about the question of how should I live my life? What is good?

01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:42.660
[Amit Varma]: What is bad? What is moral? You know, which comes into play in not just, you know, all

01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:46.580
[Amit Varma]: our personal relationships as well, because typically what happens is that, especially

01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:50.420
[Amit Varma]: in a place like India, there are templates for all of these things. This is what a husband

01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:54.260
[Amit Varma]: and a wife are, this is what a father and a son are, or so on and so forth from either

01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:59.700
[Amit Varma]: side of the equation. And thinking about this stuff for yourself can make you re examine

01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:06.340
[Amit Varma]: what is wrong with those templates and all of that. So what have been your thoughts on?

01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:09.340
[Guest]: I think we should ask somebody who's more moral than I am actually doing.

01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:13.340
[Amit Varma]: There's nothing called more moral. We agreed it's a delusion, right?

01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:18.580
[Guest]: Well, I'm not going to use the word delusion. I think break it down into three different

01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:25.420
[Guest]: compartments, right? So one is, again, a very elemental sociological fact that you live

01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:30.140
[Guest]: in a society and you need forms of social cooperation, even make your individual flourishing

01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:39.580
[Guest]: possible. And what are the norms appropriate to that form of social cooperation, right?

01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:43.620
[Guest]: That allows each of us to live with enough dignity and freedom. And that's the basic,

01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:50.180
[Guest]: I think, liberal question. And you don't have to get deeply metaphysical about it. Where

01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:55.060
[Guest]: does that come from? That can actually, it can be a mixture in some senses of one just

01:55:55.060 --> 01:56:04.740
[Guest]: recognizing won't it be attractive to live in a society where not everybody around you,

01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:11.300
[Guest]: you're not threatened by everybody around you. And one condition of making them unthreatening,

01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:16.020
[Guest]: making us unthreatening to each other is to, again, acknowledge a certain kind of equality

01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:22.580
[Guest]: and reciprocity, right? So I think the public morality part, I mean, not particularly original,

01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:27.780
[Guest]: but I think that part, I think liberalism did get, I think, broadly right, that, you

01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:36.100
[Guest]: know, for the most part, it's the best way. The second part, I think, has to do in some

01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:45.980
[Guest]: ways with when you say living morally is, you know, in part, the moral dilemmas we face

01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:53.780
[Guest]: are provided by the forms of life that we inhabit. Now, some of these forms of life

01:56:53.780 --> 01:57:02.940
[Guest]: are familiar that can be oppressive, right? But the pathways you choose require those

01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:09.980
[Guest]: social forms of life to exist. Even you being a broadcaster requires an institution of this

01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:19.620
[Guest]: kind, right? Being an entrepreneur requires, in some senses, a whole social structure,

01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:28.940
[Guest]: property rights, whatever, right? Now, I think the tough question is, what are those forms

01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:40.780
[Guest]: of life that, again, constrain us in ways that actually fundamentally violate our value?

01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:46.140
[Guest]: Problem with oppressive tradition is not that it's tradition, not that it's oppressive.

01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:52.500
[Guest]: The problem is that mostly when it's oppressive, it's, again, denying you agency and reciprocity,

01:57:52.500 --> 01:58:05.260
[Guest]: right? That's what patriarchy does. It says women are not agents in any respect, right?

01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:15.340
[Guest]: But the uncomfortable truth is that that stuff doesn't just apply to traditional institutions.

01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:19.980
[Guest]: Many would argue that can also apply to the modern economy, right? I mean, again, the

01:58:19.980 --> 01:58:26.780
[Guest]: idea of treating labor as a commodity, right? Where there'll be large numbers of people

01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:33.940
[Guest]: whose choices are determined by the reign of necessity, right? And your relationship

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:39.220
[Guest]: to them is governed by that reign of necessity, right? By the way, that reign of necessity

01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:45.140
[Guest]: applies to capital as well. You know, when we all say, under this system, I have to do

01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:53.820
[Guest]: this, right? So, critiquing forms of life, that's actually a much harder task. It's easier

01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:58.060
[Guest]: to critique them in the abstract. But that goes back to the point we started with, which

01:58:58.060 --> 01:59:05.420
[Guest]: is how do you actually reconfigure some of those things where the ethical dilemmas that

01:59:05.420 --> 01:59:11.300
[Guest]: come from participating in forms of life that are actually intrinsically violating something

01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:17.260
[Guest]: you hold important, right? And again, to go back to William James, he was right. He said

01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:24.380
[Guest]: the only way we deal with it is often by being partially blind, right? We will have the Taj

01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:29.340
[Guest]: Mahal, but we'll shut out the labor behind it in some ways, right? Maybe the world is

01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:33.100
[Guest]: tragic enough that you have to kind of, in some senses, keep doing it. But I think the

01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:38.020
[Guest]: critique of forms of life, I think, is an interesting question that older liberals used

01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:44.660
[Guest]: to ask in some ways. Another example, I think, of that, which I think is particularly important

01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:49.500
[Guest]: at this point, you know, if you look at the 19th century debate on freedom, this was a

01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:55.460
[Guest]: point of consensus across the board, whether it was socialists, Marxists, liberals. You

01:59:55.460 --> 02:00:03.180
[Guest]: cannot be truly free unless you have control over your time, which is there's a large part

02:00:03.180 --> 02:00:09.100
[Guest]: of your life that is governed by purposes that you set for yourself, not because you

02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:14.940
[Guest]: have to, or it's a, right? It's a promise on which actually a lot of modern society

02:00:14.940 --> 02:00:19.940
[Guest]: has failed, right? And from Mill to Keynes, there was this liberal fantasy, look, technology

02:00:19.940 --> 02:00:24.420
[Guest]: should enable all of this, right? But somehow, we've not been able to come up with social

02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:30.140
[Guest]: arrangements, right? Where that very core idea of an autonomous self, the self that

02:00:30.140 --> 02:00:35.380
[Guest]: is actually controlling time and setting to purposes that are authentically your own,

02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:42.500
[Guest]: your thick desires, not just necessity, not just thin desire, right? So I think one needs

02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:49.340
[Guest]: to think about how we subject institutions to that kind of critique. I actually think

02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:55.100
[Guest]: the capitalism argument, I think on the efficiency desire argument, you know, it's so kind of

02:00:55.100 --> 02:01:02.460
[Guest]: optimized that argument, that all of these questions of value, right? To, you know, use

02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:08.540
[Guest]: the title of Milton Friedman's book, Capitalism and Freedom, where is the freedom part in

02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:17.660
[Guest]: this? Right? I think that's a much harder question, I think, to think about, because

02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:22.300
[Guest]: even if you can conceptually think about it, it's not actually clear what forms of collective

02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:30.980
[Guest]: action, you know, accomplish that, and particularly given the tragedies of the 20th century history,

02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:36.380
[Guest]: what has been done in the name of that kind of freedom, you know, I think puts us all

02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:41.540
[Guest]: in I think, I think, in a sense, a bit of quandary. The third and I think, final thing,

02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:48.940
[Guest]: which I mean, going back to I think, the religious sensibility, which I think, I think is some

02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:58.100
[Guest]: level part of aesthetics, as well, which is that you have to find sources of joy in the

02:01:58.100 --> 02:02:06.180
[Guest]: world. And that joy can, I think, my own view is, I think, it's hard to find it without

02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:12.660
[Guest]: some conception of objective value behind it. Right? It's true, we are transient creatures,

02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:19.100
[Guest]: right? It's not, it's not important whether, you know, we live or survive tomorrow. But

02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:26.460
[Guest]: what is important, right? And what gives an enduring sense of joy, or why do we go on?

02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:31.060
[Guest]: Is the sense that there are some things that are actually worth striving for, you know,

02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:35.220
[Guest]: it could be creating a great podcast, it could be creating, you know, great forms of music

02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:45.500
[Guest]: in some ways, right? I think opening yourself up to that, that there is objective value.

02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:51.980
[Guest]: I think total cynicism about value can bring a certain kind of clarity about how you operate

02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:57.820
[Guest]: in this world. I'm very sceptical that it can bring you joy in the long run.

02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:02.500
[Amit Varma]: So let me ask you a provocative question. You spoke about sources of joy, right? And

02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:07.860
[Amit Varma]: the most fundamental source of joy is neurons in your brain firing together in a particular

02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:13.300
[Amit Varma]: way. And, and I interpret that as happiness, it makes me feel good, it could be, you know,

02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:18.940
[Amit Varma]: maybe I eat something nice, or I see something pretty or, or whatever it is. Now, you could

02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:25.740
[Amit Varma]: have a thought experiment where we are like in a matrix like world, or we are, you know,

02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:29.740
[Amit Varma]: in a machine where you have electrodes going inside our head, I think Nozick also had a

02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:37.180
[Amit Varma]: similar thought experiment. And, and we could be happy forever. And like, if, like, when

02:03:37.180 --> 02:03:41.940
[Amit Varma]: I pose a question to myself, that would that be a good, like, what is objectionable about

02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:46.180
[Amit Varma]: that if everyone could just be strapped up to this machine, and they live their entire

02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:50.980
[Amit Varma]: lives feeling joy, feeling happiness, feeling whatever, what is the problem? And my answer

02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:56.700
[Amit Varma]: to that is a problem is that I am denying the agency of all these people that I'm taking

02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:03.780
[Amit Varma]: away their autonomy. But the question that is harder to answer is that, why am I placing

02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:08.660
[Amit Varma]: a value on this autonomy? Right? And I could sort of waffle around and I could say things

02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:14.040
[Amit Varma]: like, you know, that their existence is meaningless if they don't have that autonomy, and so on.

02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:20.860
[Amit Varma]: But then a further why emerges? Why? You know, so what's if I if I can put that to you, what's

02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:25.940
[Amit Varma]: your answer? And by the way, my philosophy towards life now is exactly what you said

02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:31.300
[Amit Varma]: that I try to look for small things that make me happy, you know, so I've realized that

02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:35.300
[Amit Varma]: the key to happiness is being mindful in the present moment and taking joy in what you

02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:42.540
[Amit Varma]: have around you. But just as a provocation, it's a question that I sort of struggle with

02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:47.660
[Amit Varma]: that to me that autonomy, that agency is everything, but why?

02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:56.780
[Guest]: So the I think the originally, this experiment was proposed in the exchange between JJC smart

02:04:56.780 --> 02:05:01.780
[Guest]: and Bernard Williams, and it was like part of Bernard Williams, that if happiness is

02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:04.460
[Guest]: all you want, you know, if you're plugged up to a pleasure machine, and you know, just

02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:10.460
[Amit Varma]: keeps kind of giving you pleasure, I misremembered that it is Williams.

02:05:10.460 --> 02:05:17.020
[Guest]: I was like a different take on this kind of thought experiment, right? One, let me say

02:05:17.020 --> 02:05:22.740
[Guest]: I kind of see the thought experiment, but at one level, I also find it unintelligible.

02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:28.000
[Guest]: And I find it unintelligible in the sense that it's not clear to me that under those

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:36.060
[Guest]: conditions, you can say it's Amit Verma, who's happy. Amit Verma is in a sense, a narrative,

02:05:36.060 --> 02:05:40.900
[Guest]: right? It's not just kind of agents. I mean, it's, it's, it's, there's no you there to

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:45.540
[Guest]: be happy. I mean, I think I think I think on the logic of that, if you want to take

02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:51.780
[Guest]: it actually, one step further, and it's related to the agency point, right? It's, it's, it's

02:05:51.780 --> 02:06:00.580
[Guest]: actually a kind of perverse reversal of the Buddhist view that look, it's just a series

02:06:00.580 --> 02:06:07.940
[Guest]: of momentary sensations. There is actually nothing else, except this, you know, but who's

02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:14.500
[Guest]: the you that is experiencing it? Who's the you that actually gives meaning to even the

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:23.820
[Guest]: term pleasure in some ways, right? So, to me, I think, if that were a possibility, or

02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:31.420
[Guest]: at least, we recognize that as a possibility, pretty much everything else about us would

02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:37.140
[Guest]: become unintelligible, right? So, I actually think this is not just in the realm of hypotheticals.

02:06:37.140 --> 02:06:43.860
[Guest]: I think it's a realm where you can, you can complicate the question very many different

02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:50.620
[Guest]: ways, right? Why are we even using the term happiness? Would this kind of being, right,

02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:56.780
[Guest]: I mean, kids born, you know, there's like, you know, would the kid be able to say I'm

02:06:56.780 --> 02:07:02.300
[Guest]: happy? I mean, that's, that's, that's an artifact of a certain kind of society that's created

02:07:02.300 --> 02:07:07.420
[Guest]: language, agency, and all of that stuff, right? So, I actually think that will be such a kind

02:07:07.420 --> 02:07:15.340
[Guest]: of radical transformation of the structure of the cosmos that, yes, I mean, I've no problem

02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:22.420
[Guest]: conceding, right, that if such a situation would come to pass, then our whole world would

02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:26.740
[Guest]: break down, but it would break down to the point where actually even the question becomes

02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:33.580
[Guest]: unintelligible, right? Oh, Amit, would you like to live your life hooked up to a machine?

02:07:33.580 --> 02:07:39.780
[Guest]: There's no Amit here anymore. There's no conception of pleasure here anymore, right? At least

02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:44.340
[Guest]: pleasure is, in a sense, we understood it, understand it as a kind of conceptual category,

02:07:44.340 --> 02:07:49.500
[Guest]: right? So, I, that's, I think, my take on that, that it's not just that it will actually

02:07:49.500 --> 02:08:00.800
[Guest]: destroy my agency, right, is it actually destroys pretty much everything, any form of intelligibility

02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:05.660
[Guest]: that we know. And I don't know how to think outside of the horizons of that. I mean,

02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:10.500
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, in my thought experiment, I wouldn't know I'm hooked up to a machine. I, you

02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:14.580
[Amit Varma]: know, perhaps we are already both hooked up to machines. And, and, you know, when you say

02:08:14.580 --> 02:08:18.580
[Amit Varma]: that there is no you there to be happy, you know, going back to the construction of the

02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:23.220
[Amit Varma]: self, there could be an argument that there is no you there anyway, you know, like before

02:08:23.220 --> 02:08:27.820
[Amit Varma]: my dad died of COVID, he had Parkinson's, and I saw that sense of you, that sense of

02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:33.100
[Amit Varma]: a person gradually dissolving and becoming something else entirely. I recognized that

02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:38.300
[Amit Varma]: one day that could happen to me if I live long enough, inevitably, and you know, humility,

02:08:38.300 --> 02:08:44.380
[Amit Varma]: therefore, demands that we are skeptical of this notion of you. But liberalism demands

02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:50.100
[Amit Varma]: that we place this you on a pedestal because individual rights and all and I would, and

02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:53.340
[Amit Varma]: I think we should all be both more humble and more liberal. So where are we to go?

02:08:53.340 --> 02:09:00.220
[Guest]: No. So, see, again, I mean, I think you have to ask what are the context? So, so, you know,

02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:03.380
[Guest]: when you ask what's the good life, right? I mean, I think the fundamental component of

02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:08.700
[Guest]: good life is a kind of reflectiveness. And reflectiveness is different from having rules

02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:13.140
[Guest]: and formulas. I mean, liberals can often be very unreflective when they act simply on

02:09:13.140 --> 02:09:18.460
[Guest]: rules and formulas. But the condition of reflectiveness, particularly when thinking

02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:24.700
[Guest]: about the I right, and, and, and this even religions would argue for the dissolution

02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:33.620
[Guest]: of the I will concede, right? Is you have to look at where people are sitting, and what

02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:43.420
[Guest]: is the vantage point? Right? Yes, you and I may dissolve tomorrow, our memories fade,

02:09:43.420 --> 02:09:50.260
[Guest]: our sense of self or even our sense of our own past fail, right? But we were implicated

02:09:50.260 --> 02:09:59.500
[Guest]: in a community, right? Friends, relatives, children, right spouses. They have given a

02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:04.580
[Guest]: narrative arc to our I, to our I, right in some sense. And that's one context of an I

02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:09.220
[Guest]: in some ways, right? There's an I in relation to the state where which is what you're talking

02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:14.700
[Guest]: about liberalism, which is that for those purposes, we are a kind of ontological unit

02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:22.140
[Guest]: that has dignity and value in our own right in, you know, in some ways, right? There's

02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:26.700
[Guest]: the biological conception of I, right, where there's, you might say, the transmutation

02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:35.940
[Guest]: of our physical body and our neurons, right? And our peculiar dignity is precisely that

02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:41.140
[Guest]: there is a kind of value in all of these. So even those who talk about the dissolution

02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:48.380
[Guest]: of the self, right? I mean, in some senses, that's the point at which you have no embodied

02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:54.260
[Guest]: existence whatsoever. And, you know, most religions, this kind of talk about rising

02:10:54.260 --> 02:11:01.100
[Guest]: about your ego, but moksha and nirvana are actually not very seriously propagated, right?

02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:09.020
[Guest]: Because in some senses, they are actually uninteresting, right? It's that the I is actually

02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:14.060
[Guest]: produced in the context of these different locations. And it's actually having a clarity

02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:24.940
[Guest]: about that, right? And negotiating these tensions, that actually produces a higher form of, you

02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:30.220
[Guest]: know, you might say selflessness in some ways, right? I mean, you know, the sense that, oh,

02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:35.380
[Guest]: okay, yes, I have no I can also be a kind of act of narcissism in some senses, right?

02:11:35.380 --> 02:11:41.700
[Guest]: I mean, even if that is true, the fact is, you are a causal agent in this world right

02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:48.660
[Guest]: now. When you move your arm, the air moves. If you say something, it has effects, right?

02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:54.180
[Guest]: It's true that that doesn't mean you will have a stable I over time. But it does mean

02:11:54.180 --> 02:11:59.460
[Guest]: that your ability to create an effect in this world, right, requires a certain attribution

02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:03.980
[Guest]: of responsibility to you. So, there's a, you know, there's a construction of I in the context

02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:10.020
[Guest]: of an attribution of responsibility. So, I would actually say that I agree with you that,

02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:15.980
[Guest]: you know, there isn't a kind of stable essential thing called an I, right? But I don't think

02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:21.940
[Guest]: it actually follows from that, that there aren't uses of that, which are again, inescapable

02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:26.460
[Guest]: uses. I mean, the reason in philosophical context, the term necessity is important,

02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:31.700
[Guest]: because it's not just delusion. I mean, it's delusion only if you have a sense that, look,

02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:36.220
[Guest]: the only things that are real are material in some ways. It's necessity in the sense

02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:43.580
[Guest]: that it's the condition of intelligibility in some ways. And then the paradox that is

02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:49.980
[Guest]: often said, right, you know, it's Derek Parfit writes an article saying the self does not

02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:56.500
[Guest]: exist. And you want to say, well, who is Derek Parfit? Right? I mean, now I'm being a little

02:12:56.500 --> 02:13:02.340
[Guest]: bit flippant, and there's a good philosophical answer to that question, right? But in that

02:13:02.340 --> 02:13:04.940
[Guest]: sense, reflection and context matters.

02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:09.420
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, before we go into the break, one final question about the self, and then

02:13:09.420 --> 02:13:13.820
[Amit Varma]: we can come back and talk about the world and about India and whatever. And that question

02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:19.740
[Amit Varma]: comes from, you know, you mentioned reflection. And I have also been thinking of late about

02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:24.780
[Amit Varma]: how so many people aren't given to self reflection at all, they just live their lives along whatever

02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:30.140
[Amit Varma]: grooves they happen to be on, and they don't think much about it. Now, recently, something

02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:35.660
[Amit Varma]: happened in my life, which I think was fairly life changing, in the sense that all these

02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:40.920
[Amit Varma]: years I've had this intellectual curiosity to find out about the world, but I had no

02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:45.740
[Amit Varma]: idea what was going on in my own body, or so on and so forth. But a friend of mine,

02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:50.460
[Amit Varma]: Ajay Shah, the economist recommended I get a continuous glucose monitor, a CGM, I kind

02:13:50.460 --> 02:13:55.420
[Amit Varma]: of did that, alarmed by what I saw changed my habits and my lifestyle entirely because

02:13:55.420 --> 02:14:00.100
[Amit Varma]: of that in terms of what I eat, how much I exercise all of that. And I think that's great.

02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:05.500
[Amit Varma]: And I want to sort of cultivate that further. And that got me to thinking about, okay, I

02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:11.220
[Amit Varma]: have gotten a CGM for the body. But what about a CGM for the self or a CGM for the soul if

02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:18.060
[Amit Varma]: one is to, you know, articulate that grandly, or a self reflection machine, so to say. And

02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:24.340
[Amit Varma]: the question I want to ask you is, how can, in your view, just and I'm thinking aloud

02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:29.140
[Amit Varma]: here, how does one cultivate self reflection? When I look at my own life, and I think about

02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:33.820
[Amit Varma]: the person I am and the things that I do and the way that I am, how, you know, what are

02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:38.100
[Amit Varma]: the kind of metrics I should use? What are the kind of questions I should ask myself?

02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:45.100
[Guest]: I mean, you strike me as a very reflective person. So one, I, you know, I actually don't

02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:50.300
[Guest]: think it's a question of some people are not reflective, I think, pretty much all of us

02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:54.580
[Guest]: are not reflective in some areas of our lives. I mean, I think I think the interesting question

02:14:54.580 --> 02:14:59.940
[Guest]: is where we end up being reflective and not, I mean, it's a, it's a line that kind of,

02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:04.580
[Guest]: and again, part of it is actually understandable for good reason. I mean, you know, which is

02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:14.580
[Guest]: that, if you think reason under determines choice and value, right? You think knowledge

02:15:14.580 --> 02:15:22.420
[Guest]: is always partial. And we are finite beings. Then the consequence of being a fully reflective

02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:27.220
[Guest]: being all the time would be actually disable every kind of action. I remember the discussion

02:15:27.220 --> 02:15:31.620
[Guest]: in some senses, we were having the forms of life, right? And the forms of life often provide

02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:38.420
[Guest]: a closure. I mean, look, if I have to run an institution, if I have to run a factory,

02:15:38.420 --> 02:15:47.180
[Guest]: if I have to feed kids, under the circumstances that our society provides for us, I have no

02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:52.300
[Guest]: option but to bring a certain kind of closure to my reflection, right? So I think there's

02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:57.060
[Guest]: that that's one kind of a constraint, right? And so we can kind of all fall into our grooves.

02:15:57.060 --> 02:16:02.780
[Guest]: I mean, what's the point of me thinking about something that is outside of the horizon of

02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:09.300
[Guest]: possibility in some ways, right? We let a few privileged thinkers do it, society creates

02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:16.180
[Guest]: a risk investment pool, you know, you guys, you know, sit and think up these experiments.

02:16:16.180 --> 02:16:19.460
[Guest]: So I think that's what I think this is the second reason why we close off reflection,

02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:23.940
[Guest]: which is has to do with I think, a point you had made earlier, which is, you know, it is

02:16:23.940 --> 02:16:30.060
[Guest]: actually often practice that gives us meaning, right? So it's not easy to answer the question,

02:16:30.060 --> 02:16:35.460
[Guest]: why are you doing this rather than that? I mean, you know, you can say it gives me meaning,

02:16:35.460 --> 02:16:43.900
[Guest]: but could I actually, you know, explain in fully, you know, rational optimisation terms,

02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:48.380
[Guest]: why I should be doing podcasts rather than doing something else? Answer is no, right?

02:16:48.380 --> 02:16:54.540
[Guest]: So I would not be too hard, I think, in some ways. And I actually agree with Bernard Williams's

02:16:54.540 --> 02:17:02.820
[Guest]: kind of takedown of Socrates, you know, that all saying that a non-reflective life is not

02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:10.180
[Guest]: worth living. And I actually think that's false. I mean, I do think you can live incredibly

02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:17.980
[Guest]: worthwhile lives and not actually be reflective in that kind of broad sense. So I don't worry

02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:25.020
[Guest]: about the problem of reflection in general. I mean, it's, you know, where I think it probably

02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:36.060
[Guest]: matters most is, I think, in our political relations to others, where because you're

02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:43.700
[Guest]: counting on their cooperation, they are yours, right? It's just hard to imagine coming up

02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:48.220
[Guest]: with just terms of social cooperation that does not involve at least a minimal kind of

02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:52.900
[Guest]: reflection, let me listen to what they're saying, right? What is the other side of this

02:17:52.900 --> 02:17:59.540
[Guest]: argument? How do I give this person who's been totally excluded, standing in some ways?

02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:04.980
[Guest]: And to me, I think the most interesting instigators of reflection, so there's the personal stuff,

02:18:04.980 --> 02:18:08.740
[Guest]: right? All of us go through a phase in life where we are not paying attention to our bodies,

02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:16.620
[Guest]: and there'll be some external shock that induces us. But often the most important instigator

02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:23.300
[Guest]: of reflection, one that matters morally, is where one somebody challenges you, even in

02:18:23.300 --> 02:18:32.900
[Guest]: a familial context, right? And to give up on reflection, then is to basically then say,

02:18:32.900 --> 02:18:41.340
[Guest]: look, I think only force can settle this argument, right? So I worry about reaching a point where,

02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:47.980
[Guest]: you know, we are committed to saying, look, only force can settle this argument. That's

02:18:47.980 --> 02:18:52.100
[Guest]: the sense in which reflection is important. But, you know, should you all the time be

02:18:52.100 --> 02:18:55.300
[Guest]: reflecting on everything you do? I'm actually not sold on that proposition.

02:18:55.300 --> 02:19:00.620
[Amit Varma]: Well, I mean, I don't think we should obviously all the time be reflective because then nothing

02:19:00.620 --> 02:19:06.260
[Amit Varma]: would get done. But then part of my question also becomes is, when do we circumscribe it?

02:19:06.260 --> 02:19:11.620
[Amit Varma]: And when is it necessary? And most importantly, what are the questions I should ask myself?

02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:18.220
[Guest]: You know, it's an example you gave about the body, right? At one level, I mean, you know,

02:19:18.220 --> 02:19:22.180
[Guest]: if you were a serious philosopher, you would say, actually, this is not an example of reflection

02:19:22.180 --> 02:19:28.020
[Guest]: as much as prudence, right? That in a way, most of us live our lives prudently, and that

02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:34.020
[Guest]: this happens in a particular context of life, right? This form of prudence becomes important,

02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:40.620
[Guest]: right? Take care of your health. I think with reflection, I'm not sure there's a metric,

02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:45.060
[Guest]: but I think there are two or three features that you've seen. One is, I think, in hyper

02:19:45.060 --> 02:19:49.620
[Guest]: awareness of the conditionality of everything you're saying. I mean, the social science

02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:58.460
[Guest]: version of this is under what conditions. And to lead a reflective life in part a kind

02:19:58.460 --> 02:20:06.140
[Guest]: of self-awareness of the conditionality of anything. So it's not saying, look, you know,

02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:10.820
[Guest]: this commitment is bad, because I've kind of taken a decision and closed off reflection

02:20:10.820 --> 02:20:15.460
[Guest]: of it. It's just being aware of the conditions under which you actually took a particular

02:20:15.460 --> 02:20:22.180
[Guest]: decision, right? And often, the most reflective people, I think, are playful in that sense.

02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:27.040
[Guest]: They are constantly, in some senses, thinking of that conditionality. That's the opposite

02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:32.660
[Guest]: of dogmatism as well. That sense of conditionality also opens you up to the world, because the

02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:37.380
[Guest]: reflection has to be a reflection about the world. I mean, it's not just a kind of right.

02:20:37.380 --> 02:20:45.700
[Guest]: And if you already have a sensibility that is not open to the conditionality of everything,

02:20:45.700 --> 02:20:51.060
[Guest]: right, you're pretty much closing yourself off to the world. So I would say I think that

02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:58.300
[Guest]: to me is often a good sign, where when people present arguments, or when they think about

02:20:58.300 --> 02:21:04.180
[Guest]: why they give certain beliefs authority, they can actually articulate and are aware of actually

02:21:04.180 --> 02:21:10.220
[Guest]: the conditionality of those claims and stuff. That's probably as good a metric as any of

02:21:10.220 --> 02:21:11.820
[Amit Varma]: reflectiveness.

02:21:11.820 --> 02:21:15.540
[Amit Varma]: That's something I'll certainly reflect on. Let's take a quick commercial break. And on

02:21:15.540 --> 02:21:20.060
[Amit Varma]: the other side, we'll continue our conversation.

02:21:20.060 --> 02:21:23.620
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it? Well, I'd love

02:21:23.620 --> 02:21:28.300
[Amit Varma]: to help you. Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, the art of

02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:32.740
[Amit Varma]: clear writing. An online community has now sprung up of all my past students. We have

02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:37.660
[Amit Varma]: workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students and vibrant community interaction.

02:21:37.660 --> 02:21:41.980
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

02:21:41.980 --> 02:21:46.180
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises, much interaction,

02:21:46.180 --> 02:21:50.620
[Amit Varma]: a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST,

02:21:50.620 --> 02:21:55.420
[Amit Varma]: or about $150 and is a monthly thing. So if you're interested, head on over to register

02:21:55.420 --> 02:22:00.980
[Amit Varma]: at indiancut.com slash clear writing. That's indiancut.com slash clear writing. Being a

02:22:00.980 --> 02:22:06.180
[Amit Varma]: good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard and a clear

02:22:06.180 --> 02:22:12.260
[Amit Varma]: idea of what you need to do to refine your skills. I can help you.

02:22:12.260 --> 02:22:16.500
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Pratap Bhanu Mehta about many

02:22:16.500 --> 02:22:20.380
[Amit Varma]: things including the nebulousness of the self before the break. So you could argue that

02:22:20.380 --> 02:22:25.300
[Amit Varma]: you know, who are the people who are talking if the self is so nebulous? I want to ask

02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:29.420
[Amit Varma]: you a question about the world and try to understand it better. And I mean, these are

02:22:29.420 --> 02:22:34.740
[Amit Varma]: confusing times, we touched on this at the start of the episode, that many of our assumptions

02:22:34.740 --> 02:22:38.900
[Amit Varma]: about the world, especially the assumption of progress are being challenged. And I see

02:22:38.900 --> 02:22:45.820
[Amit Varma]: two broad trends playing out in the world, which seem to be going in different directions.

02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:52.820
[Amit Varma]: And one is the spread of populism and authoritarianism, and illiberalism, and so on and so forth.

02:22:52.820 --> 02:22:59.940
[Amit Varma]: And the other is a sort of empowerment of individuals by technology, something that

02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:06.860
[Amit Varma]: you disparagingly referred to as tech solutionism. But in general, as a trend, technology enabling

02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:11.940
[Amit Varma]: individuals enabling components of liberal liberalism, which, you know, failed in certain

02:23:11.940 --> 02:23:17.620
[Amit Varma]: political ways, but tech is achieving that. And there, what is happening also, as a consequence

02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:23.460
[Amit Varma]: of that is in many different domains, a crumbling of mainstreams, like we see it in media where

02:23:23.460 --> 02:23:28.500
[Amit Varma]: the mainstream is gone in the 90s, you there was a mainstream media, you had a consensus

02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:33.260
[Amit Varma]: on the truth that's dissipated. And in a sense, it's a net positive, everyone has a means

02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:38.020
[Amit Varma]: of production in their hands. And that is empowering for individuals. But the mainstream

02:23:38.020 --> 02:23:43.020
[Amit Varma]: is gone, I see that in the creative economy. And I sometimes speculate about whether that

02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:47.940
[Amit Varma]: is happening in terms of nation states itself, where, you know, the internet makes us all

02:23:47.940 --> 02:23:53.740
[Amit Varma]: global citizens able to form communities of choice, we are no longer constrained by circumstance

02:23:53.740 --> 02:24:01.340
[Amit Varma]: or geography. And, you know, one of these trends is centralizing and narrowing. And

02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:09.540
[Amit Varma]: the other of these trends is sort of a broadening of, you know, not just our scope and potential,

02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:15.500
[Amit Varma]: but also a broadening of our imagination. And I don't know how to reconcile the two.

02:24:15.500 --> 02:24:18.780
[Amit Varma]: And apart from this very nebulous sense of, okay, these two really separate things are

02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:23.460
[Amit Varma]: happening and one is bad, and the other is mostly good. Beyond that, I haven't thought

02:24:23.460 --> 02:24:29.500
[Amit Varma]: about it with much rigor. So give me a sense of, you know, what's really happening in the

02:24:29.500 --> 02:24:34.540
[Guest]: world? What's the story of the last 10 years? You ask the kinds of questions only God can

02:24:34.540 --> 02:24:43.580
[Guest]: answer. We can speculate, we can speculate. So again, I think I would separate out your

02:24:43.580 --> 02:24:49.540
[Guest]: two questions, both because, and I think you hinted at it, which is not that one is broadly

02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:57.180
[Guest]: good and one other bad, which is both of them have, I think, a certain kind of internal

02:24:57.180 --> 02:25:08.620
[Guest]: tension and contradiction, right? So let's start with the illiberalism story first. And

02:25:08.620 --> 02:25:12.340
[Guest]: with your permission, let's take a step back from this current moment again, just to try

02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:20.500
[Guest]: and see, you know, what's contingent about a moment and what's kind of enduring here.

02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:27.740
[Guest]: If you look at the sources of illiberalism in the modern world, right, you can create

02:25:27.740 --> 02:25:35.220
[Guest]: a long list, but there are three that I think are politically quite salient. One which we

02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:39.220
[Guest]: have talked a lot about, so I won't dwell on it here, which is, in a sense, nationalism,

02:25:39.220 --> 02:25:47.900
[Guest]: right? I mean, most arguments for abridging individual liberty in our context have some

02:25:47.900 --> 02:25:54.020
[Guest]: connection to nationalism, national security, even religious arguments, even arguments over

02:25:54.020 --> 02:25:59.900
[Guest]: blasphemy, even arguments over offence to religion, is because religion has been ethnicised

02:25:59.900 --> 02:26:08.340
[Guest]: into a collective identity, right? And historically, we don't have an answer to this question that

02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:14.140
[Guest]: nationalism, you know, both enables a modern democracy, but also puts individual liberties

02:26:14.140 --> 02:26:19.900
[Guest]: at risk. And I don't think that's actually distinctive, I think it, you know, waxes and

02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:26.180
[Guest]: wanes in some ways. And, you know, the era where there was a kind of uncommit, you know,

02:26:26.180 --> 02:26:30.500
[Guest]: an unapologetic commitment to liberalism in the face of nationalism has been actually

02:26:30.500 --> 02:26:36.620
[Guest]: very, very rare. You know, even in the US, we can talk about now, but when you look at

02:26:36.620 --> 02:26:41.060
[Guest]: Jim Crow, when you look at McCarthyism, actually, even if you look at American free speech jurisprudence

02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:47.660
[Guest]: in the late 1950s, early 60s, it's actually not that liberal once you come down to it.

02:26:47.660 --> 02:26:56.020
[Guest]: So I think on that, one can, all one can say is, look, this is a aporia at the heart of

02:26:56.020 --> 02:27:03.580
[Guest]: our politics, we can't do without nations and yet can't live with them. But there's

02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:10.780
[Guest]: a second perspective and just, you know, just to sort of broaden the debate a bit. You know,

02:27:10.780 --> 02:27:16.580
[Guest]: you began with Fukuyama, and when Fukuyama talked about the end of history, again, this

02:27:16.580 --> 02:27:22.300
[Guest]: is an oversimplification of the argument. But broadly, the argument was that, look,

02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:27.040
[Guest]: there's a big 20th century battle between, in some senses, communism and some combination

02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:33.140
[Guest]: of liberal democracy and capitalism and liberal democracy and capitalism one, broadly speaking.

02:27:33.140 --> 02:27:39.180
[Guest]: And that combination is a relatively stable combination. It's not the most exalted. It

02:27:39.180 --> 02:27:45.380
[Guest]: doesn't cater to the highest greatness we are capable for. But it does satisfy our thymos

02:27:45.380 --> 02:27:51.220
[Guest]: in some senses, our kind of spiritedness, it sublimates it in some ways. I think what's

02:27:51.220 --> 02:27:58.300
[Guest]: happening in the world right now, I configure the modern ideological landscape slightly

02:27:58.300 --> 02:28:02.060
[Guest]: differently. It's not, it's actually compatible with Fukuyama's, but a slightly different

02:28:02.060 --> 02:28:09.260
[Guest]: way of thinking about it. That if you look at, you know, 20th century political history

02:28:09.260 --> 02:28:15.220
[Guest]: and the history of ideas, which is something you're, you know, deeply interested in, two

02:28:15.220 --> 02:28:22.380
[Guest]: things strike you quite remarkably, right? One is the endurance and persistence of certain

02:28:22.380 --> 02:28:26.900
[Guest]: political forms and ways of thinking, right? So, at one level, it's quite remarkable that,

02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:32.620
[Guest]: you know, American debates are still talking about 1776, right? I mean, it's just talk

02:28:32.620 --> 02:28:36.620
[Guest]: of the conditionality of the world. It just seems like a very, very different world. But

02:28:36.620 --> 02:28:44.020
[Guest]: here's this document constructed in 1776, around which so many debates have been configured.

02:28:44.020 --> 02:28:51.900
[Guest]: You think of China, almost 100 years of the party state as a political form, right? You

02:28:51.900 --> 02:28:57.220
[Guest]: think of West Asia, right? And by West Asia, I'm using broadly, but basically Pakistan

02:28:57.220 --> 02:29:04.580
[Guest]: to Egypt, right? There's this question that is set off in the late 19th, early 20th century,

02:29:04.580 --> 02:29:10.980
[Guest]: which is, is there a modern form of Islamic constitutionalism possible that can both acknowledge

02:29:10.980 --> 02:29:18.780
[Guest]: the sovereignty of God, and yet be a modern constitution, right? And you look at Africa,

02:29:18.780 --> 02:29:26.900
[Guest]: right, which, in some senses, the modern African political theory project was, never again

02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:32.180
[Guest]: do we want a world which is divided by the colour line and the colour line becomes the

02:29:32.180 --> 02:29:40.700
[Guest]: basis of exploitation, right? And India is in this kind of odd place where, in this respect,

02:29:40.700 --> 02:29:46.740
[Guest]: it actually ends up being part of, in a sense, that liberal capitalist domain where we basically

02:29:46.740 --> 02:29:55.500
[Guest]: come to the conclusion that creating a broadly liberal constitution with a democracy in a

02:29:55.500 --> 02:29:59.180
[Guest]: kind of unlikely place, in fact, the arguments are even stronger in a place like India, because

02:29:59.180 --> 02:30:03.980
[Guest]: this is the only thing that can in some ways keep the peace, at least that was the argument.

02:30:03.980 --> 02:30:09.060
[Guest]: Now, what strikes me about the world at the moment is there's an exhaustion around all

02:30:09.060 --> 02:30:18.980
[Guest]: of these projects. And by exhaustion, I mean, three things specifically. One, the sense

02:30:18.980 --> 02:30:26.700
[Guest]: amongst people that, as currently conceived, these projects are not delivering what they

02:30:26.700 --> 02:30:31.260
[Guest]: promised, there is a kind of crisis of legitimacy, it can be actually very mundane. I mean, if

02:30:31.260 --> 02:30:35.500
[Guest]: you ask me about the US right now, and you say, you know, what is the biggest failure

02:30:35.500 --> 02:30:40.180
[Guest]: of liberals? I don't think it's an ideological failure. It's that liberals have to demonstrate

02:30:40.180 --> 02:30:47.580
[Guest]: that they can govern. Why do liberal states have the worst homeless crisis in America?

02:30:47.580 --> 02:30:52.380
[Guest]: Why do they have the worst opioid crisis in America, right? Why is American infrastructure

02:30:52.380 --> 02:31:02.200
[Guest]: so terrible, right? So, there is a sense in which those foundational questions are no

02:31:02.200 --> 02:31:08.980
[Guest]: longer translating into the kinds of governance expectations that people naturally assume.

02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:13.260
[Guest]: Increasingly, this is going to be true of China and has been for a while, right? To

02:31:13.260 --> 02:31:19.460
[Guest]: me, the sign that a state has to resort to more repression, and more closure and more

02:31:19.460 --> 02:31:27.180
[Guest]: surveillance is often a tacit admission that it has an internal legitimacy crisis. The

02:31:27.180 --> 02:31:34.620
[Guest]: party state that China perfected was a extraordinary 20th century political form. In fact, I think

02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:40.820
[Guest]: it's a more important distinction than the communism, capitalism one, right? Where you

02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:46.460
[Guest]: said, look, we'll organize a political society around a political party that is different

02:31:46.460 --> 02:31:50.620
[Guest]: from political parties in the West. It's not a party of interest. It's not a party of principle.

02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:56.860
[Guest]: It's a party that is both a vanguard. So, it projects into the future. It says, these

02:31:56.860 --> 02:32:02.260
[Guest]: are the principal contradictions society needs solving, party is the instrument to do it.

02:32:02.260 --> 02:32:07.100
[Guest]: All conflicts are mediated through the party. And the party is representative because the

02:32:07.100 --> 02:32:14.980
[Guest]: party comes to stand in the nation, for the nation in some ways, right? Now, the fact

02:32:14.980 --> 02:32:21.300
[Guest]: that China is having to resort to more repression, more surveillance, that modest optimism we

02:32:21.300 --> 02:32:24.940
[Guest]: had under Deng times, not that China would become a liberal democracy, I don't think

02:32:24.940 --> 02:32:30.580
[Guest]: that was ever on the cards, and maybe for good reason, right? But a sense that there

02:32:30.580 --> 02:32:37.540
[Guest]: could be a party state form that could cohabit with other political forms, and be relatively

02:32:37.540 --> 02:32:44.380
[Guest]: more open, right? That's facing, in a sense, an internal crisis of legitimacy. Liberal

02:32:44.380 --> 02:32:50.660
[Guest]: democracies facing an internal crisis of legitimacy, as I said, one, it's governance credentials.

02:32:50.660 --> 02:32:57.420
[Guest]: And look, fundamentally, even now in India, right? Yes, communalism is important. But

02:32:57.420 --> 02:33:02.940
[Guest]: at the heart of the matter is finding political parties and people who look like they can

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:09.420
[Guest]: lead and govern, right? And the dilemma for centrists and liberals is that they look terrible

02:33:09.420 --> 02:33:13.900
[Guest]: on that score, at least to most of the people. Now, whether it's right or wrong, we can debate,

02:33:13.900 --> 02:33:20.620
[Guest]: but you know, that's the sheen that the Congress Party lost. It was never great. But now, the

02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:23.740
[Guest]: re's almost a sense you can't even govern your own party, how you're going to govern

02:33:23.740 --> 02:33:31.620
[Guest]: the country, right? West Asia, right? In some senses, the central contradiction in that

02:33:31.620 --> 02:33:39.100
[Guest]: project, which is running from Pakistan to Egypt, right? Is the answer to that question

02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:42.460
[Guest]: of can you have an Islamic state under the sovereignty of God, you can have one that

02:33:42.460 --> 02:33:50.820
[Guest]: is relatively decent, you can have one that is progressive in some ways. But can it allow

02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:57.940
[Guest]: for the kinds of freedoms that a modern world is premised on, including, most importantly,

02:33:57.940 --> 02:34:02.540
[Guest]: the freedom of thought and expression? That's turning out to be a misnomer, right? And this

02:34:02.540 --> 02:34:07.700
[Guest]: was the illusion of, you know, even the most enlightened thinkers like Iqbal, or very sophisticated

02:34:07.700 --> 02:34:14.420
[Guest]: thinkers like Maududi, right? That you kind of create these modern Islamic states. So,

02:34:14.420 --> 02:34:19.460
[Guest]: that project has been in crisis for a while. And again, there are many reasons for that

02:34:19.460 --> 02:34:27.740
[Guest]: crisis, geopolitics, imperialism, rantier states, it's not just an ideological crisis.

02:34:27.740 --> 02:34:32.820
[Guest]: The African project, in some senses, right? That if you, at one level, you could argue

02:34:32.820 --> 02:34:39.340
[Guest]: that if you're interested in racism and colour line, it's deeply entwined with the political

02:34:39.340 --> 02:34:44.140
[Guest]: power in geopolitics of the African continent, in some ways that if it gets its act together,

02:34:44.140 --> 02:34:50.220
[Guest]: right, the world system would look different in terms of how it divides, you know, how

02:34:50.220 --> 02:34:58.020
[Guest]: it thinks of in the sense of the race question. So, my sense is that I think what makes this

02:34:58.020 --> 02:35:04.100
[Guest]: moment if it's not that history ended, it's that there is a kind of internal exhaustion

02:35:04.100 --> 02:35:08.620
[Guest]: that the entire world is feeling. It's not that right now, China looks like a better

02:35:08.620 --> 02:35:13.780
[Guest]: competitor to liberal democracy, as much as the BJP might want to create elements of a

02:35:13.780 --> 02:35:21.620
[Guest]: party state, right? And then cutting through all of that is the simple fact that the answer

02:35:21.620 --> 02:35:28.380
[Guest]: to almost every legitimation crisis has been the creation or recreation of some form of

02:35:28.380 --> 02:35:38.780
[Guest]: nationalism. Because it's a form of solidarity that depends on identification, not on achievement.

02:35:38.780 --> 02:35:42.820
[Guest]: If you're creating a solidarity based on equality and reciprocity, you better show it. If you're

02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:47.500
[Guest]: creating a solidarity based on saying, you know, we produce 10% growth, there's enough

02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:52.700
[Guest]: goodies for everybody to go around, you better produce it. If you create solidarity based

02:35:52.700 --> 02:35:56.300
[Guest]: on saying we are the greatest country in the world, because we have the best infrastructure,

02:35:56.300 --> 02:36:03.740
[Guest]: we can provide housing for everyone, you better produce it. So, I think in that sense, there

02:36:03.740 --> 02:36:12.340
[Guest]: is a kind of, I think, a global kind of ideological exhaustion in these four major projects that

02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:16.980
[Guest]: actually were the fulcrum of politics in the 20th century in those regions. And as I said,

02:36:16.980 --> 02:36:21.580
[Guest]: the remarkable thing about is the stickiness, right? I mean, which is once that question

02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:28.500
[Guest]: becomes fundamental to politics, that way of framing a question, how it kind of endures,

02:36:28.500 --> 02:36:35.260
[Guest]: even in its kind of most pathological form sometimes, right? And all of this then is

02:36:35.260 --> 02:36:42.340
[Guest]: happening in the crisis, in the context of some larger social changes, as you in a sense

02:36:42.340 --> 02:36:50.660
[Guest]: indicate forms of communication, the tectonic shift of power to Asia, which gives a geopolitical

02:36:50.660 --> 02:36:56.980
[Guest]: edge to the question of nationalism, right? In a way, and I think, pretty much every regime

02:36:56.980 --> 02:37:04.100
[Guest]: from Putin to Xi Jinping, and arguably, India, maybe the US will also come around to it is

02:37:04.100 --> 02:37:12.540
[Guest]: against taking the national project around some form of global geopolitical presence.

02:37:12.540 --> 02:37:18.700
[Guest]: But except now, it's happening in circumstances that are extremely competitive. I mean, you

02:37:18.700 --> 02:37:24.340
[Guest]: know, and to that extent, you have to give, you know, I think, compliments to neoliberalism

02:37:24.340 --> 02:37:29.620
[Guest]: that it did lift millions of people out of poverty did actually change the balance of

02:37:29.620 --> 02:37:34.500
[Guest]: power, I think, in the world in which, you know, many people on the left do not actually

02:37:34.500 --> 02:37:45.180
[Guest]: acknowledge, right? For whatever it's, I think, other, you know, other faults. So you have

02:37:45.180 --> 02:37:51.180
[Guest]: the making of a perfect storm, internal ideological exhaustion in a condition where geopolitical

02:37:51.180 --> 02:38:01.660
[Guest]: competition can no longer be managed by any hegemonic power of any kind, right? I think

02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:09.540
[Guest]: to me, that is, I think, at the heart in some senses of illiberalism. I don't think it's

02:38:09.540 --> 02:38:14.860
[Guest]: a simple choice. Do people vote on their prejudices? Are they being communal? Or are they being,

02:38:14.860 --> 02:38:22.420
[Guest]: you know, voting instrumentally? I think the way people often think about politics is politics

02:38:22.420 --> 02:38:27.940
[Guest]: is always about concrete people and concrete political parties, right? What are your choices?

02:38:27.940 --> 02:38:33.260
[Guest]: And they come to some judgments about relative credibility. So it's actually quite possible

02:38:33.260 --> 02:38:38.380
[Guest]: that you might think X is a thorough rogue, but turns out to be, from your point of view,

02:38:38.380 --> 02:38:49.660
[Guest]: slightly lesser rogue than others, right? So, you know, and in that reservoir of credibility,

02:38:49.660 --> 02:38:57.980
[Guest]: I think liberals lost a lot of that argument. I don't think they lost that argument only

02:38:57.980 --> 02:39:03.780
[Guest]: because, you know, their parties were hijacked by wokeism. Frankly, I think wokeism is as

02:39:03.780 --> 02:39:08.900
[Guest]: much a kind of its impact is as much exaggerated by the right, because it's an ideal convenient

02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:15.060
[Guest]: ideological tool against which to define your identity. It's also a way of not confronting

02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:20.300
[Guest]: something that is at the core of wokeism everywhere, and not just US, which is the question of

02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:25.660
[Guest]: equality, right? I mean, it's become a kind of, you know, sometimes a way of evading that

02:39:25.660 --> 02:39:34.220
[Guest]: question, right? But it also has to do with concrete structures of governance. Now, it

02:39:34.220 --> 02:39:40.420
[Guest]: could be I mean, you know, the Inflation Reduction Act has passed in the US, it could be that

02:39:40.420 --> 02:39:45.820
[Guest]: this is a turning point, that, but a lot will depend on what happens in the real economy

02:39:45.820 --> 02:39:50.980
[Guest]: over the next, you know, year, two years, three years, it could be a demonstration that

02:39:50.980 --> 02:39:55.700
[Guest]: the US can again do large projects that, you know, it now doesn't, it's actually worse

02:39:55.700 --> 02:40:00.180
[Guest]: than India, in some ways, it takes four years to fix an escalator in the New York subway.

02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:03.820
[Guest]: It could be a way of demonstrating that the administrative state that the liberals created

02:40:03.820 --> 02:40:09.220
[Guest]: is not an obstacle to actually creating these kinds of projects that people share in. But

02:40:09.220 --> 02:40:14.260
[Guest]: good leaders, in a sense, build their reservoir across these domains. So I think with Narendra

02:40:14.260 --> 02:40:22.220
[Guest]: Modi, for example, I mean, I don't think it's just communalism. It's, he tries to build

02:40:22.220 --> 02:40:27.780
[Guest]: a reservoir in all kinds of ways, including sending you personalized letters for paying

02:40:27.780 --> 02:40:31.340
[Guest]: your taxes, and you know, doing all the nice things that you have done for the country

02:40:31.340 --> 02:40:37.060
[Guest]: amidst, you know, it's a way of gaining familiarity, right? Whether it's in some senses, it's the

02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:44.180
[Guest]: new welfarism. And I think the challenge for the center and the left is to actually demonstrate

02:40:44.180 --> 02:40:49.220
[Guest]: that kind of credibility, where we are hampered by the fact that we don't actually have a

02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:53.820
[Guest]: political party vehicle that can do that at the moment.

02:40:53.820 --> 02:41:00.300
[Amit Varma]: So I'm fascinated by the term ideological exhaustion. And what that sort of makes me

02:41:00.300 --> 02:41:07.140
[Amit Varma]: wonder is, was ideology ever so big in the first place? Was it ever a determining factor?

02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:11.820
[Amit Varma]: Like when I look at India alone, which is the only country about which I think I can

02:41:11.820 --> 02:41:17.940
[Amit Varma]: talk with lived experience, as it were, what I see essentially, is that for decades, it's

02:41:17.940 --> 02:41:23.100
[Amit Varma]: the elites who had an ideology, which was this received idea of a secular and tolerant

02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:28.420
[Amit Varma]: India and all of that. And I think, I'm not sure that was really shared by the masses.

02:41:28.420 --> 02:41:33.020
[Amit Varma]: I think the way we drifted through the decades was partly because of inertia, partly because

02:41:33.020 --> 02:41:38.300
[Amit Varma]: most people weren't empowered, and that empowerment started happening late. And, you know, and

02:41:38.300 --> 02:41:43.860
[Amit Varma]: we've discussed this before my sense that our society always had these currents running

02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:48.420
[Amit Varma]: through it, and that now politics has caught up with society, finally. So I'm wondering

02:41:48.420 --> 02:41:54.260
[Amit Varma]: if there ever was any ideological hold, or is that a story we like to tell ourselves?

02:41:54.260 --> 02:41:59.740
[Amit Varma]: Like, I think, you know, when we explain the world, it's essential to tell ourselves stories,

02:41:59.740 --> 02:42:05.860
[Amit Varma]: it is inevitable that they will both be simple and simplistic. And I wonder if privileging

02:42:05.860 --> 02:42:12.500
[Amit Varma]: ideology as a convenient way to explain political currents everywhere, somehow is such a small

02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:16.620
[Amit Varma]: part of the story that it's, you know, that it misses.

02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:20.580
[Guest]: You've actually answered your own question in two different ways. I mean, right, which

02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:25.140
[Guest]: is, you're, of course, right, that, you know, this is not a kind of explanation, right,

02:42:25.140 --> 02:42:31.180
[Guest]: in a sense, right? I think the point about ideological exhaustion, right, was in some

02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:39.620
[Guest]: senses, to say that, when you have, in a way, this kind of triple crisis, where whatever

02:42:39.620 --> 02:42:43.620
[Guest]: is the dominant narrative of your society, right, that basic structure that was taught

02:42:43.620 --> 02:42:49.820
[Guest]: to govern it, is not seen to be delivering the goods, right? That's, in a sense, condition

02:42:49.820 --> 02:42:59.320
[Guest]: number one. Condition number two, when new problems arise, to which that ideology does

02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:03.100
[Guest]: not seem fit for purpose, right? And that's part of the problem with the nation state

02:43:03.100 --> 02:43:06.660
[Guest]: thing. It's not fit for purpose for individual liberty, but it's not fit for purpose for

02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:11.460
[Guest]: actually solving planetary problems right now. I mean, you know, competitive nationalism

02:43:11.460 --> 02:43:17.280
[Guest]: is not going to be good for the planet in some ways, right? So, there's a kind of, right?

02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:23.020
[Guest]: And the third, in a sense, is a kind of more psychological one, where there isn't the articulation

02:43:23.020 --> 02:43:32.140
[Guest]: of any political party, vehicle, entity, that you have some presumptive credibility, that

02:43:32.140 --> 02:43:37.220
[Guest]: has some presumptive credibility or you have faith in, right? Now, I agree with you. I

02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:43.820
[Guest]: mean, you know, it's very hard to argue that India was secular, although I don't think

02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:47.620
[Guest]: it's an elite mass thing, because I think a lot of modern attacks on secularism are

02:43:47.620 --> 02:43:53.500
[Guest]: actually elite attacks, including amongst intellectuals, by the way. And ordinary people

02:43:53.500 --> 02:43:59.060
[Guest]: can often accommodate a vernacular secularism in practice, I think, much more effectively.

02:43:59.060 --> 02:44:03.580
[Guest]: But what you did have for good or for ill, right, is you, because of the history of the

02:44:03.580 --> 02:44:11.140
[Guest]: national movement, you had a leadership in a political party that carried enough reservoirs

02:44:11.140 --> 02:44:17.580
[Guest]: of credibility. When people voted for Jawaharlal Nehru, I don't think they voted by saying,

02:44:17.580 --> 02:44:24.540
[Guest]: you know, is Nehru secular or not? I think broadly, it was, yeah, looks like somebody

02:44:24.540 --> 02:44:28.460
[Guest]: who's generally competent and has the best interest of the country at the heart. And

02:44:28.460 --> 02:44:34.540
[Guest]: then, you know, a lot of the political culture changes around that, right? So you, in a sense,

02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:41.420
[Guest]: have an exhaustion of all of those elements, which no longer. And it's precisely under

02:44:41.420 --> 02:44:51.140
[Guest]: those circumstances, that partly nationalism is just tempting. Because it's the one easy

02:44:51.140 --> 02:44:56.180
[Guest]: identification narrative that you can actually produce across large numbers of people without

02:44:56.180 --> 02:45:01.300
[Guest]: doing, and the world is such that it is actually giving you raw material for doing it, right?

02:45:01.300 --> 02:45:07.100
[Guest]: There's the global geopolitical context, you know, okay. So, the exhaustion point was to

02:45:07.100 --> 02:45:13.500
[Guest]: kind of understand how do we end up in a place where in a sense, we are so receptive to the

02:45:13.500 --> 02:45:18.580
[Guest]: idea of just kind of smashing up a lot of stuff, which sustained us, right? The second

02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:25.180
[Guest]: point about ideology, and where I may differ with you slightly is, I'm actually stuck by

02:45:25.180 --> 02:45:30.220
[Guest]: the stickiness of the question. So it's not so much the, you know, which is, when you

02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:35.780
[Guest]: think of Indian debates, right, it's now 75 years since independence. And even now with

02:45:35.780 --> 02:45:41.860
[Guest]: the BJP, I mean, it might change, as if Hindu nationalism consolidates its power. There's

02:45:41.860 --> 02:45:46.580
[Guest]: a kind of basic frame within which we have the debate. And a lot of the debate is really

02:45:46.580 --> 02:45:52.260
[Guest]: about the effectiveness of that frame, whether it's implemented consistently the hypocrisies

02:45:52.260 --> 02:45:58.300
[Guest]: that attend to that story. When you think about the US, right, again, it's thinking

02:45:58.300 --> 02:46:04.620
[Guest]: within a horizon of very entrenched institutions, right? When you think of the party state in

02:46:04.620 --> 02:46:10.900
[Guest]: China, again, the state party has gone internal transformation. But it seems outside of the

02:46:10.900 --> 02:46:16.380
[Guest]: horizon of possibility, that there's a big voice saying, you know, boss, now let's have

02:46:16.380 --> 02:46:20.900
[Guest]: we have to think outside the horizon of the party state as we understood, right? I mean,

02:46:20.900 --> 02:46:27.100
[Guest]: the one thing that's announced in China is kind of competitive elections, right? Pakistan,

02:46:27.100 --> 02:46:33.740
[Guest]: right, or Egypt in some ways, where you say, yes, Islam is important. It's, you know, it's

02:46:33.740 --> 02:46:40.740
[Guest]: in some sense, it's a kind of extraordinary civilization. But has the time come to think

02:46:40.740 --> 02:46:47.580
[Guest]: outside of the horizon of a conception that is institutionalized in the state, and has

02:46:47.580 --> 02:46:52.140
[Guest]: to protect, you know, people against blasphemy or something, right? I mean, that's the no

02:46:52.140 --> 02:46:57.140
[Guest]: no question in some senses, right? Okay. So in that sense, I don't think it's specific

02:46:57.140 --> 02:47:02.900
[Guest]: ideological beliefs, it's that our framing of the question has already actually taken

02:47:02.900 --> 02:47:07.740
[Guest]: on board a certain conception of the horizons of possibility. And sometimes these are good

02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:11.620
[Guest]: things. I mean, you know, it's probably a good thing that, you know, liberal democracies

02:47:11.620 --> 02:47:17.020
[Guest]: are not yet thinking of converting themselves into party states. But you know, certainly

02:47:17.020 --> 02:47:23.900
[Guest]: the the Trump movement was a wake up call, that actually, in part, the response to that

02:47:23.900 --> 02:47:30.020
[Guest]: exhaustion is to say, actually, we need somebody who can smash this stuff open, even using

02:47:30.020 --> 02:47:35.300
[Guest]: the means that actually brought them to power to do it. So in that sense, I think ideology

02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:39.260
[Guest]: actually matters a lot. I mean, I think it's, in fact, we often don't recognize it, because

02:47:39.260 --> 02:47:44.780
[Guest]: it's actually so deeply embedded in the frames in which we are using, right, to pose the

02:47:44.780 --> 02:47:48.580
[Guest]: question, which will then circumscribe the range of answers you can give.

02:47:48.580 --> 02:47:54.300
[Amit Varma]: So here's a provocative question about India or a provocative thought, which is that, you

02:47:54.300 --> 02:47:58.140
[Amit Varma]: know, it's almost become cliched to talk of different ideas of India, Nehru's idea of

02:47:58.140 --> 02:48:04.540
[Amit Varma]: India, perhaps Modi's idea of India. And one contention could be that both these ideas

02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:09.100
[Amit Varma]: of India, as it were, to, you know, simplify and say that there are two, both these ideas

02:48:09.100 --> 02:48:15.500
[Amit Varma]: of India are colonial ideas, and therefore unsustainable, in the sense that the modern

02:48:15.500 --> 02:48:22.740
[Amit Varma]: Indian project, the political project of, you know, Sardar Patel and VP Menon, bringing

02:48:22.740 --> 02:48:27.820
[Amit Varma]: all these princely states together, and so on, seems to me to be like a fast track colonization,

02:48:27.820 --> 02:48:32.860
[Amit Varma]: what the British did over 200, 300 years, these guys did in a couple of years, and they

02:48:32.860 --> 02:48:37.660
[Amit Varma]: did it through coercion, they did it through promises that were later broken. They did

02:48:37.660 --> 02:48:43.260
[Amit Varma]: it in all kinds of ways, you know, under the notion that the end justifies the means and

02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:47.860
[Amit Varma]: this is a glorious end. Now, the thing is, at one level, I can look at this nation state

02:48:47.860 --> 02:48:52.420
[Amit Varma]: that we have today, and these lines on a map and India and I love this country deeply and

02:48:52.420 --> 02:48:57.940
[Amit Varma]: I can celebrate our diversity and all the good things about us, as you know, JP Narayan

02:48:57.940 --> 02:49:01.460
[Amit Varma]: once pointed out to me that it's okay to say we are an illiberal nation, but at the same

02:49:01.460 --> 02:49:06.580
[Amit Varma]: time, we are liberal in so many lived ways, like the assimilation, which is reflected

02:49:06.580 --> 02:49:14.060
[Amit Varma]: in our food, our languages, our clothes, everything. But is this unsustainable in the sense that

02:49:14.060 --> 02:49:18.820
[Amit Varma]: in governance terms, I think everybody agrees that the more federal you are, the more local

02:49:18.820 --> 02:49:23.620
[Amit Varma]: government is, the better it is for the people. My sense of the modern Indian state today

02:49:23.620 --> 02:49:29.340
[Amit Varma]: is that it is a replica of the colonial state, except that our rulers today have brown skin

02:49:29.340 --> 02:49:35.180
[Amit Varma]: instead of white skin. We are not really citizens, except in theory, we are subjects and they

02:49:35.180 --> 02:49:41.420
[Amit Varma]: are rulers. And, and you know, when you look a little bit down the road, you see that big

02:49:41.420 --> 02:49:46.780
[Amit Varma]: problem of delimitation also coming up, which is bound to for understandable reasons, raise

02:49:46.780 --> 02:49:53.260
[Amit Varma]: a lot of shackles. And I think that, you know, whether or not we think outside the box, the

02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:57.900
[Amit Varma]: box will think outside of itself, in the sense that look, there is a sense of permanence

02:49:57.900 --> 02:50:03.500
[Amit Varma]: about this, but this nation has existed for 75 years, there might even be a sense of permanence

02:50:03.500 --> 02:50:09.540
[Amit Varma]: about China's one party state, but the sample size of history through which it has, you

02:50:09.540 --> 02:50:14.300
[Amit Varma]: know, survived this one party state, it's not necessary that it lasts much longer, everything

02:50:14.300 --> 02:50:20.700
[Amit Varma]: in the present moment seems made of rock, but it withers away in a day. So, what are

02:50:20.700 --> 02:50:23.700
[Amit Varma]: sort of, you know, your thoughts on this?

02:50:23.700 --> 02:50:29.460
[Guest]: Okay, so let me push back against that. I mean, at one level, I agree with you, but

02:50:29.460 --> 02:50:33.300
[Guest]: I agree with you, I think in a general sense, I don't think there's anything peculiar about

02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:39.580
[Guest]: India. All nation states are states created through coercion colonization. I mean, there

02:50:39.580 --> 02:50:46.060
[Guest]: isn't a single, I mean, it's, you know, there isn't a single example. And I think it's important

02:50:46.060 --> 02:50:49.500
[Guest]: not to exceptionalize Indian history in that way. I mean, not as a defensive measure, but

02:50:49.500 --> 02:50:54.420
[Guest]: I think just as a kind of analytical proposition that, you know, because in a way, and I want

02:50:54.420 --> 02:50:59.540
[Guest]: to kind of distinguish the question of the nation and the state for a second, but precisely

02:50:59.540 --> 02:51:05.940
[Guest]: because the modern state is an ambitious state, right, it has to institutionalize deeply,

02:51:05.940 --> 02:51:12.260
[Guest]: it has to collect revenues on a different scale, it has to do lots of different things.

02:51:12.260 --> 02:51:18.540
[Guest]: Precisely because of that, it has to, in some senses, disembed everything that resists us

02:51:18.540 --> 02:51:24.500
[Guest]: quite powerfully. So, all states are kind of statist in that way. I mean, there hasn't

02:51:24.500 --> 02:51:31.740
[Guest]: been a, you know, and I think this was an argument even Hayek made. In fact, the criticism

02:51:31.740 --> 02:51:36.460
[Guest]: of Hayek is, you know, there's this term authoritarian libertarianism, that first you need to get

02:51:36.460 --> 02:51:41.900
[Guest]: that capable state in, you know, take out all the obstacles in its path, then you will

02:51:41.900 --> 02:51:43.820
[Amit Varma]: get these nice liberated individuals.

02:51:43.820 --> 02:51:46.740
[Amit Varma]: From where I stand, actually, Hayek was a bit of a commie, but please continue.

02:51:46.740 --> 02:51:51.100
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, it's for exactly that reason. I mean, there's a kind of collectivism in

02:51:51.100 --> 02:51:54.980
[Guest]: Hayek, actually, which is actually quite striking and a collectivism that's actually becomes

02:51:54.980 --> 02:52:03.620
[Guest]: quite crude, when he talks about the state. So, there is something in a sense about the

02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:12.820
[Guest]: sociology of modernity, not anything particular to India, right? Where there will always be

02:52:12.820 --> 02:52:20.420
[Guest]: this dialectic of the state, in a sense, wanting to create a particular form of order, and

02:52:20.420 --> 02:52:27.100
[Guest]: society resisting it, right? And in some senses, almost every historical comparative political

02:52:27.100 --> 02:52:33.100
[Guest]: literature, turns out, basically, centers on the proposition, what is the balance of

02:52:33.100 --> 02:52:38.740
[Guest]: the state and society? China, the quip went was all state, no civil society. India had

02:52:38.740 --> 02:52:43.900
[Guest]: a kind of light state, at least in terms of its ambition, and now it's kind of transforming

02:52:43.900 --> 02:52:48.260
[Guest]: into modern. You just can't get industrialization, you can't get the kind of labor mobility,

02:52:48.260 --> 02:52:54.100
[Guest]: all of that stuff without that state. So, in that sense, the process of state formation,

02:52:54.100 --> 02:52:59.820
[Guest]: I think is always going to be fraught in this kind of way. And I think the arguments about

02:52:59.820 --> 02:53:07.820
[Guest]: centralization and decentralization are always tactical arguments, in light of what the purpose

02:53:07.820 --> 02:53:13.740
[Guest]: of that state is. I think from a democratic point of view, and from the point of view

02:53:13.740 --> 02:53:19.660
[Guest]: of the delivery of certain kinds of services, I can agree with you, India is way too centralized.

02:53:19.660 --> 02:53:24.340
[Guest]: But frankly, there's no straightforward story. I mean, if you look at the literature on education,

02:53:24.340 --> 02:53:31.220
[Guest]: for example, right, it actually turns out, authoritarian states were far better than

02:53:31.220 --> 02:53:36.820
[Guest]: decentralized democratic states. The impulse to actually, you know, education often came

02:53:36.820 --> 02:53:43.020
[Guest]: from this extraneous purpose of building a state in nature, right? So, in that sense,

02:53:43.020 --> 02:53:50.660
[Guest]: I don't think India is an exception. And in India, because of the nature of social cleavages,

02:53:50.660 --> 02:53:55.140
[Guest]: this project has turned out differently in parts where we are successful at democratically

02:53:55.140 --> 02:54:02.780
[Guest]: incorporating it, as we have in some senses, right, with most states. Where we've tried

02:54:02.780 --> 02:54:07.860
[Guest]: repression, we usually fail, because I think there's enough kind of social resistance to

02:54:07.860 --> 02:54:13.500
[Guest]: it, right? So, it's not that in India, repression has kind of succeeded better than democracy.

02:54:13.500 --> 02:54:20.260
[Guest]: It's part of that same state society balance, whether it's democratic or not. Now, the question

02:54:20.260 --> 02:54:27.180
[Guest]: of the nation, I think, is a much more complicated one. And again, the cliche, all nation states

02:54:27.180 --> 02:54:33.260
[Guest]: are modern, the nation state form in which we understand it, which is horizontal conceptions

02:54:33.260 --> 02:54:43.340
[Guest]: of citizenship, equality, full membership, you know. Now, see, in India, there's a, there's

02:54:43.340 --> 02:54:48.100
[Guest]: a peculiar, I think, challenge. And I think we kind of under appreciate what the Nehru

02:54:48.100 --> 02:54:56.180
[Guest]: Sardar Patel project is. So, if you look at Europe, if you look at the map of Europe,

02:54:56.180 --> 02:55:05.220
[Guest]: the formation of nation states was accompanied by the bloodiest of exclusions. I mean, partly

02:55:05.220 --> 02:55:08.500
[Guest]: we don't see that because they accomplished that before they became nation states, 18th

02:55:08.500 --> 02:55:11.460
[Guest]: century, you can expel the Catholics, you can expel the Jews, you can do all kinds of

02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:16.940
[Guest]: things, right? Right. We forget Britain had an oath of allegiance till, you know, late

02:55:16.940 --> 02:55:22.500
[Guest]: 19th century, right? But even more startlingly, if you look at Michael Mann's work, The Dark

02:55:22.500 --> 02:55:28.380
[Guest]: Side of Democracy, the ethnic homogenization that went into the creation of nation states,

02:55:28.380 --> 02:55:31.820
[Guest]: because empires by their nature are kind of multilingual, but empires are not ambitious

02:55:31.820 --> 02:55:35.380
[Guest]: entities. So long as you're not challenging the ruler and giving decent enough taxes,

02:55:35.380 --> 02:55:38.660
[Guest]: they don't care, right? Which is why they can allow for your customs, they can allow

02:55:38.660 --> 02:55:42.900
[Guest]: for, you know, there's no modernizing project in most empires, most empires, some of them

02:55:42.900 --> 02:55:51.700
[Guest]: do. So, the project of the nation state, because it involves new conceptions of membership,

02:55:51.700 --> 02:55:56.860
[Guest]: new questions of who is the people. In a way, we don't actually have to answer that question

02:55:56.860 --> 02:56:01.520
[Guest]: politically before the 19th century. So, I think this debate was how far back Indian

02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:06.180
[Guest]: consciousness goes, Hindu consciousness goes, is actually beside the point. I mean, you

02:56:06.180 --> 02:56:11.420
[Guest]: can actually concede that it maybe goes far, there is actually a consciousness and I actually,

02:56:11.420 --> 02:56:17.420
[Guest]: I think academic scholarship is doing Indian history a disservice by this over determinism

02:56:17.420 --> 02:56:24.820
[Guest]: of kind of colonialism, right, as a kind of instigator for this conduct. But the specific

02:56:24.820 --> 02:56:31.340
[Guest]: form in which the question of nation is presented to us post 1857, now we are going to be a

02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:38.260
[Guest]: modern society. A modern society requires a different power sharing arrangement, right,

02:56:38.260 --> 02:56:46.220
[Guest]: than an empire does. If it's going to be a democracy, then that power sharing arrangement

02:56:46.220 --> 02:56:53.860
[Guest]: involves questions of majority and minority. And so, it's out of that crucible of representative

02:56:53.860 --> 02:57:01.140
[Guest]: democracy that actually our modern communal problem takes the turn it does. And the hard

02:57:01.140 --> 02:57:05.660
[Guest]: question for us is actually the intimate connection between this problem and the question of democratic

02:57:05.660 --> 02:57:12.860
[Guest]: representation, right? Particularly, once you start thinking in terms of majorities

02:57:12.860 --> 02:57:16.740
[Guest]: and minorities. Now, the simple solution would be, look, we are all individuals, right? That's

02:57:16.740 --> 02:57:20.860
[Guest]: in a sense, formally the American solution. But then you have to create the conditions

02:57:20.860 --> 02:57:28.660
[Guest]: to get there. Now, the second thing that I think Nehru and Patel grasp, right? So, and

02:57:28.660 --> 02:57:36.300
[Guest]: honestly, the question of representation and identity ended in failure with partition.

02:57:36.300 --> 02:57:39.980
[Guest]: India is born against the backdrop of the failure to resolve that question, which is

02:57:39.980 --> 02:57:47.420
[Guest]: fundamentally about a power sharing question, right? But Nehru and Patel, I think, also

02:57:47.420 --> 02:57:52.180
[Guest]: understood this thing about India, right? And when they looked at Europe, it's interesting,

02:57:52.180 --> 02:57:58.540
[Guest]: all Indian nationalists, right, including Nehru were not gung-ho about nationalism.

02:57:58.540 --> 02:58:03.580
[Guest]: I mean, Gandhi and Tagore are explicitly post-national thinkers in some ways. But even the Nehru's,

02:58:03.580 --> 02:58:07.840
[Guest]: even Aurobindo Ghosh actually kind of sees, you know, nationalism as kind of just a kind

02:58:07.840 --> 02:58:15.700
[Guest]: of transitory stage to something else. In part, because they saw the logic of the nation-state

02:58:15.700 --> 02:58:24.940
[Guest]: as homogenizing and exclusionary. For them, the beauty of the Indian experiment, right,

02:58:24.940 --> 02:58:29.860
[Guest]: is if you start breaking it up into 20 pieces, what you will get is the dynamic that 19th

02:58:29.860 --> 02:58:36.580
[Guest]: century Europe got, right? You can't object to a collective narcissism at a higher level,

02:58:36.580 --> 02:58:43.020
[Guest]: and then expect the smaller collective narcissism to, in some senses, be morally kosher, right?

02:58:43.020 --> 02:58:49.540
[Guest]: To the nature of cultural connections in India, right, in some senses, it's complicated braiding

02:58:49.540 --> 02:58:57.900
[Guest]: across caste, class in some ways, right, meant that any project of homogenization, right,

02:58:57.900 --> 02:59:03.220
[Guest]: at a local level, which is what, let's say, breaking up India into 10, 15, you know, 20

02:59:03.220 --> 02:59:10.620
[Guest]: different states, which could sustain, would require, is it would require actually breaking

02:59:10.620 --> 02:59:16.700
[Guest]: people from their local identities and bonds in which we shouldn't assume that if Tamil

02:59:16.700 --> 02:59:20.340
[Guest]: Nadu is a state, I mean, the first thing that's going to happen is non-Tamil speakers will

02:59:20.340 --> 02:59:27.020
[Guest]: be kicked out. It happens pretty much everywhere. I mean, that's not right. So, they imagined

02:59:27.020 --> 02:59:30.740
[Guest]: India in a different way that instead of saying, you know, we're going to benchmark an Indian

02:59:30.740 --> 02:59:38.180
[Guest]: identity. And the answer to that benchmarking is lots of local benchmarks. Let these organic

02:59:38.180 --> 02:59:44.020
[Guest]: connections in some senses flow. What you need is an assurance that people's culture

02:59:44.020 --> 02:59:47.900
[Guest]: will not be trampled over. So, that's a linguistic compromise. India is unique in that kind of

02:59:47.900 --> 02:59:54.460
[Guest]: linguistic compromise, where you say 16 languages, you actually don't press the question of language

02:59:54.460 --> 02:59:58.740
[Guest]: in the way in which smaller states have never, think of tiny Sri Lanka, right? I mean, what

02:59:58.740 --> 03:00:05.020
[Guest]: a disaster, right? You know, it couldn't manage in some senses to communicate. So, the Nehru-Patel

03:00:05.020 --> 03:00:12.340
[Guest]: argument was counterintuitive. It says that let's use these cross-cutting diversities

03:00:12.340 --> 03:00:17.940
[Guest]: in some sense, in a way to imagine a new form of a nation state, which is actually not benchmarked.

03:00:17.940 --> 03:00:22.900
[Guest]: So, if you want to do a Hindu nationalist reading of our past, you're also welcome,

03:00:22.900 --> 03:00:27.900
[Guest]: in some senses, you know, if you think the Hindu nation was glorious, that's also fine.

03:00:27.900 --> 03:00:35.900
[Guest]: So long as we can agree on a kind of basic constitutional, I think, identity. We've seen

03:00:35.900 --> 03:00:39.940
[Guest]: this example in the Northeast, right? I mean, one of the interesting things about the Northeast

03:00:39.940 --> 03:00:44.760
[Guest]: and it's a place where the Indian state failed miserably, right? I mean, the amount of repression

03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:52.820
[Guest]: we used, right? But one of the interesting things about the Northeast is that there were,

03:00:52.820 --> 03:00:59.980
[Guest]: you know, a couple of insurgencies post-independence. But the minute we said, or moments in the

03:00:59.980 --> 03:01:07.740
[Guest]: Northeast said, we will align ethnicity and territoriality, you had like 20 insurgencies,

03:01:07.740 --> 03:01:13.940
[Guest]: because there's no way of aligning territoriality and ethnicity, right? Without literally pulling

03:01:13.940 --> 03:01:19.620
[Guest]: apart the society, even at the local level. So, I actually think, I think there's actually

03:01:19.620 --> 03:01:26.620
[Guest]: a much deeper sociological and practical understanding, I think, of why in some senses, you just have

03:01:26.620 --> 03:01:34.660
[Guest]: to think of India in this civilizational palimpsest terms, right? We tried one partition, I mean,

03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:41.020
[Guest]: you could argue that's one form of localism, right? Let's, right? It had the inevitable

03:01:41.020 --> 03:01:47.500
[Guest]: consequence of ethnic cleansing, right? So, this idea that you could break up India into

03:01:47.500 --> 03:01:54.220
[Guest]: small nation states, and that will somehow not raise this problem. So, Patel and Heru's

03:01:54.220 --> 03:01:57.740
[Guest]: answer and Gandhi's answer was, let's, you know, just go for the whole thing in some

03:01:57.740 --> 03:02:04.060
[Guest]: ways. The failure, I think, is the one you pointed to, which is that there are particular

03:02:04.060 --> 03:02:12.780
[Guest]: broken promises. There are parts of the country where we did not show enough faith in our

03:02:12.780 --> 03:02:19.340
[Guest]: own democracy in some ways. And so, whenever we tried democratic, you know, in the 50s,

03:02:19.340 --> 03:02:23.300
[Guest]: nobody gave India a chance, or at least many social scientists didn't. Whenever we tried

03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:31.260
[Guest]: democratic incorporation, we succeeded. And now, I think, you're right that there is an

03:02:31.260 --> 03:02:37.980
[Guest]: interesting question of what's the architecture of federalism that will continue in some senses

03:02:37.980 --> 03:02:42.860
[Guest]: to deepen that story. And there, I think we're going in the reverse direction. I mean, you

03:02:42.860 --> 03:02:49.740
[Guest]: know, there's a lot more centralization, and so forth. So, I think on this one, I'd give

03:02:49.740 --> 03:02:55.180
[Guest]: ourselves a little bit of credit. I don't think we were just aping colonial. What we

03:02:55.180 --> 03:02:59.580
[Guest]: were saying was, look, these are realities. There is a modern state, which is required

03:02:59.580 --> 03:03:04.700
[Guest]: under the modern horizons. And the only way in which you think you can make it work in

03:03:04.700 --> 03:03:11.580
[Guest]: the context of India's diversity, is to actually keep thinking of India in some senses as a

03:03:11.580 --> 03:03:17.020
[Guest]: whole, rather than saying, you know, we'll go the European way. Right. So, here's an

03:03:17.020 --> 03:03:20.780
[Guest]: innovation. I mean, it's the only nation state in the world that's still officially at least,

03:03:20.780 --> 03:03:25.420
[Guest]: right. And you could say that's a deficiency, does not push for everybody's language to

03:03:25.420 --> 03:03:31.020
[Guest]: be the same, not a classic attribute of nature. So, we actually innovated.

03:03:31.020 --> 03:03:38.300
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so, you know, before I kind of go further on that, just a minor lament that, you know,

03:03:38.300 --> 03:03:43.180
[Amit Varma]: we talk about state versus society, and markets as a third prong, though, I think markets

03:03:43.180 --> 03:03:47.580
[Amit Varma]: are just a mechanism for society to express itself through voluntary action. But otherwise,

03:03:47.580 --> 03:03:51.900
[Amit Varma]: and people would expect that, okay, I always keep talking about the predatory state, surely,

03:03:51.900 --> 03:03:56.380
[Amit Varma]: I'm on the side of society. But as an individual, I kind of have an issue with all of them,

03:03:56.380 --> 03:04:02.140
[Amit Varma]: our state tends to be oppressive, our society tends to be illiberal, markets will generally

03:04:02.140 --> 03:04:06.700
[Amit Varma]: be in thrall of one or the other, either you'll have cronyism, which are the opposite of free

03:04:06.700 --> 03:04:13.020
[Amit Varma]: markets, and so on and so forth. But leaving that little lament about the importance that

03:04:13.020 --> 03:04:18.300
[Amit Varma]: individuals deserve aside, I want to hark back to something that I think you mentioned in your in

03:04:18.300 --> 03:04:25.500
[Amit Varma]: your conversation with Shruti, where you spoke about how nationalism is just one dimension

03:04:25.500 --> 03:04:31.260
[Amit Varma]: of our problems, that the unresolved dilemma is how is power going to be shared once you

03:04:31.260 --> 03:04:36.780
[Amit Varma]: institutionalize a democracy. And there, it seems that just thinking aloud on two fronts,

03:04:36.780 --> 03:04:42.140
[Amit Varma]: we went terribly wrong. One is the first past the post system, proportional representation would

03:04:42.140 --> 03:04:47.180
[Amit Varma]: have solved many of the problems and fissures that exist today, at least it would be less

03:04:47.180 --> 03:04:51.820
[Amit Varma]: problematic. And the other, of course, is federalism, we centralized way too much,

03:04:51.820 --> 03:04:55.900
[Amit Varma]: and we centralized for rational reasons, we centralized because at the time,

03:04:55.900 --> 03:04:59.740
[Amit Varma]: we made these decisions, a country was falling apart, the center had to hold,

03:04:59.740 --> 03:05:04.860
[Amit Varma]: so it was natural to want to centralize power. And, you know, Ambedkar, of course,

03:05:04.860 --> 03:05:10.780
[Amit Varma]: was deeply suspicious and correctly so of smaller communities, you know, villages were a den of

03:05:10.780 --> 03:05:17.340
[Amit Varma]: localism, and so on and so forth. And, you know, that was another rational reason to centralize

03:05:17.340 --> 03:05:22.780
[Amit Varma]: power. The argument that you just articulated, you know, I haven't heard that before from any

03:05:22.780 --> 03:05:29.740
[Amit Varma]: of those guys. So, can you elaborate a bit on this in terms of that problem? How is how is

03:05:29.740 --> 03:05:35.180
[Amit Varma]: power going to be shared? And what is our experience with trying to solve for that problem?

03:05:35.180 --> 03:05:41.580
[Amit Varma]: And what could resolve it going forward? So, I have a slight disagreement with you

03:05:41.580 --> 03:05:50.380
[Guest]: on the first past the post system. So again, from a political science perspective, just like reason

03:05:50.380 --> 03:05:58.460
[Guest]: under determines choices, I think institutional design hugely under determines outcomes,

03:05:58.460 --> 03:06:03.340
[Guest]: usually, so I actually never buy these kind of and I think, I think there's a kind of lot of

03:06:03.340 --> 03:06:07.660
[Guest]: contextuality to it. And I'm actually not convinced that proportional representation

03:06:07.660 --> 03:06:12.780
[Guest]: is the answer to that problem, because proportional representation, because it depends on what you

03:06:12.780 --> 03:06:18.540
[Guest]: want to optimize on, right? So, if your images has five groups, we want to share, you know,

03:06:18.540 --> 03:06:23.020
[Guest]: 20% for you, 10% for you, 15% for you, proportional representation is fine, right?

03:06:24.700 --> 03:06:32.380
[Guest]: If you want to create a polity, right, where the aim of politics in some senses is to break the

03:06:32.380 --> 03:06:37.660
[Guest]: hold of those identities on you, that you see yourselves as part of these groups, right?

03:06:38.380 --> 03:06:42.060
[Guest]: Proportional representation can actually be quite a disaster, actually, in some ways.

03:06:42.060 --> 03:06:48.700
[Guest]: It can solidify the toxic, you know, and, and, and I think one of the interesting things about

03:06:48.700 --> 03:06:52.860
[Guest]: first past the post system normatively, which people under appreciate, right? Because I think

03:06:52.860 --> 03:06:56.540
[Guest]: we're, we're too mathematical about this. Politics is all about latent functions,

03:06:56.540 --> 03:07:05.820
[Guest]: not just manifest functions. So, you know, one of the original arguments for why have

03:07:05.820 --> 03:07:10.540
[Guest]: territorial based constituencies, right? I mean, that's itself is a, that's not clear,

03:07:10.540 --> 03:07:19.980
[Guest]: that's the only way to organize a democracy was supposed to be that territorial constituencies

03:07:19.980 --> 03:07:26.700
[Guest]: was a kind of proxy for a localized random selection. In any given territory, they'll be rich,

03:07:26.700 --> 03:07:31.420
[Guest]: they'll be poor. Hopefully, there'll be enough kind of caste diversity, religious diversity.

03:07:33.180 --> 03:07:37.260
[Guest]: And you want the unit to be one where you actually have to talk to everyone.

03:07:38.620 --> 03:07:45.260
[Guest]: So, so it's actually creating a process to the one of the unintended consequences of

03:07:45.260 --> 03:07:52.060
[Guest]: the first past the post system is, and again, it depends on context. Now, with party dominance

03:07:52.060 --> 03:07:58.540
[Guest]: changing, it will have a different meaning. We sometimes decry the fact that parties with small

03:07:58.540 --> 03:08:04.700
[Guest]: percentage of votes could actually hold up bills in Lok Sabha, you know, but there's a flip side

03:08:04.700 --> 03:08:12.300
[Guest]: to it. It's the system that allowed every party to share in national governance at some point,

03:08:12.300 --> 03:08:18.620
[Guest]: once that Congress hegemony is right. And what kept it together was not the formal design,

03:08:18.620 --> 03:08:24.300
[Guest]: what kept it was a certain understanding of politics. We have to talk to everyone here.

03:08:26.700 --> 03:08:30.940
[Guest]: A political self identity that politicians in some senses have that were fundamentally

03:08:30.940 --> 03:08:37.020
[Guest]: we are social mediators, at the fringes we engage in violence, but right. So,

03:08:37.020 --> 03:08:43.740
[Guest]: so whether it's first part of post system or proportional representation or presidential

03:08:43.740 --> 03:08:48.860
[Guest]: or parliamentary system, the actual work of politics and the forms of organization

03:08:49.900 --> 03:08:54.220
[Guest]: that happened outside the formal electoral process make a huge, huge difference.

03:08:55.020 --> 03:09:01.340
[Guest]: I mean, what what kept India together insofar as it was part of partition was not just,

03:09:01.340 --> 03:09:07.020
[Guest]: you know, that we had a constitution and design. It was a certain culture of the Congress Party.

03:09:07.020 --> 03:09:12.380
[Guest]: You know, you organize units regionally, you give language identity space, at least you make a show

03:09:12.380 --> 03:09:18.780
[Guest]: of inclusion, whatever, I mean, it had its limitations. Right. So, I think a lot of what

03:09:18.780 --> 03:09:22.860
[Guest]: changed in a sense was our kind of conception of politics, more than just design. I mean,

03:09:22.860 --> 03:09:25.980
[Guest]: I'm not saying that we shouldn't relook at the first part of the post system. But I think it's

03:09:25.980 --> 03:09:30.380
[Guest]: a bit quick to say, you know, it's like, if the state didn't work, market will. I mean,

03:09:30.380 --> 03:09:35.980
[Guest]: I think the underlying conditions in some senses are similar. So, then the question is, in a sense,

03:09:35.980 --> 03:09:44.700
[Guest]: what the question of power sharing is. Now, the problem with our pre-partition discussion

03:09:44.700 --> 03:09:52.700
[Guest]: on power sharing was we were all looking for an engineering solution, right? X representation,

03:09:53.980 --> 03:09:59.260
[Guest]: or if you give this community the veto on this issue. And I think Ambedkar called the bluff on

03:09:59.260 --> 03:10:07.420
[Guest]: that in his book on Pakistan. He says, boss, if you think of yourself as one nation, two societies,

03:10:09.420 --> 03:10:16.380
[Guest]: this is not going to be a power arrangement system between two communities that see themselves as

03:10:16.380 --> 03:10:22.060
[Guest]: part of the same nation. And the only way you're going to get that is in some senses,

03:10:22.060 --> 03:10:27.900
[Guest]: disembedding individuals, right? And his argument was that the strongest argument for partition is

03:10:27.900 --> 03:10:33.180
[Guest]: that it might give India the chance to modernize because it takes the Hindu-Muslim question off

03:10:33.180 --> 03:10:38.060
[Guest]: the agenda. He was not entirely sanguine about it, but he thought there was a much greater

03:10:38.060 --> 03:10:44.140
[Guest]: possibility of that than if you just locked India into this one question, what is going to be the

03:10:44.140 --> 03:10:49.340
[Guest]: balance of power between Hindus and Muslims. And unfortunately, I think since 1857, that

03:10:49.340 --> 03:10:53.500
[Guest]: political question has kind of dominated and the BJP now comes and says,

03:10:53.500 --> 03:11:05.100
[Guest]: we gave them a veto, we'll make them irrelevant, right? So, in that sense, that project,

03:11:05.900 --> 03:11:12.380
[Guest]: which was at the heart of Madisonian democracy, that you cannot make any system of representation

03:11:12.380 --> 03:11:20.380
[Guest]: run where fundamentally the purpose of representation is not to create a space

03:11:20.380 --> 03:11:25.820
[Guest]: for politics and individuality, but in some senses, to solidify identities. Now,

03:11:25.820 --> 03:11:30.940
[Guest]: you need to recognize identity sometimes, right? I mean, so the argument for, let's say,

03:11:30.940 --> 03:11:38.860
[Guest]: reservation for Dalits and Ambedkar is clear that the purpose of it is to give them the means and

03:11:38.860 --> 03:11:45.980
[Guest]: empower them to actually exercise their agency as individuals. It's not in some senses, just a

03:11:45.980 --> 03:11:53.180
[Guest]: mechanical, numerical, you know, question of power sharing. And the final question about power

03:11:53.180 --> 03:11:59.420
[Guest]: sharing is that ultimately, it's also about forms of social power, right? And one reason we worry

03:11:59.420 --> 03:12:06.940
[Guest]: about this particular moment is, you know, even if the state formally remains constitutional in

03:12:06.940 --> 03:12:15.420
[Guest]: the way that it is, and you know, you create forms of social power that stigmatize and marginalize

03:12:15.420 --> 03:12:20.060
[Guest]: and marginalize groups and target for them for being who they are, right?

03:12:22.940 --> 03:12:28.460
[Guest]: The Nehru project in some ways, right, actually kind of understood that. Now, the problem that

03:12:28.460 --> 03:12:33.260
[Guest]: happened in the sense that you don't actually have a vehicle, in some sense for achieving that

03:12:33.260 --> 03:12:38.540
[Guest]: objective. I think Gandhi was right on this. What happened to social reform? What happened to public

03:12:38.540 --> 03:12:45.420
[Guest]: education, the one crucible in which common citizenship is created around the world, right?

03:12:45.420 --> 03:12:50.780
[Guest]: That's pretty much been the most important instrument of any nation state, right? There,

03:12:52.220 --> 03:12:58.620
[Guest]: we, the liberals failed, absolutely, utterly, miserably. So, you're kind of operating on a

03:12:58.620 --> 03:13:01.740
[Guest]: project that has actually no institutional engines behind it.

03:13:03.340 --> 03:13:06.540
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, and I agree, actually, that my question was a little unfair,

03:13:06.540 --> 03:13:11.820
[Amit Varma]: because I made the mistake of comparing proportional representation in theory with

03:13:11.820 --> 03:13:16.300
[Amit Varma]: first past, supposed in practice. And if you were to do it the other way around, you know,

03:13:16.300 --> 03:13:20.060
[Amit Varma]: the argument could go the other way. And I'm convinced by your argument against proportional

03:13:21.020 --> 03:13:26.780
[Amit Varma]: representation, that it embeds those identities in place and doesn't recognize the fact that

03:13:26.780 --> 03:13:31.020
[Amit Varma]: every individual contains multitudes. And obviously, we want to move beyond identity.

03:13:31.020 --> 03:13:37.340
[Amit Varma]: But then the same argument could also be used for various kinds of affirmative action that we've

03:13:37.340 --> 03:13:41.660
[Amit Varma]: gone for, it could be used for, you know, what we did with the Hindu code bill, that you're treating

03:13:41.660 --> 03:13:46.540
[Amit Varma]: people of one particular identity in one particular way, and, you know, privileging another one by

03:13:46.540 --> 03:13:50.220
[Amit Varma]: leaving them out of it for understandable reasons that we don't want the minorities to feel

03:13:50.220 --> 03:13:56.220
[Amit Varma]: uncomfortable, but nevertheless, and this is also a sort of a tension at the heart of the project,

03:13:56.220 --> 03:14:00.620
[Amit Varma]: I think, in the sense that you have the constitution guaranteeing equality and that everyone will be

03:14:00.620 --> 03:14:05.740
[Amit Varma]: treated equally. But then you have all of these exceptions carved out with perhaps great intentions,

03:14:05.740 --> 03:14:11.900
[Amit Varma]: but you have these exceptions carved out. And in this sense, it seems a little incoherent, you know.

03:14:13.020 --> 03:14:16.220
[Guest]: So I think you have to distinguish the three cases that you mentioned, because I think they

03:14:16.220 --> 03:14:20.700
[Guest]: are very different logics. I mean, you know, to me, the reservation case, particularly for Dalits,

03:14:20.700 --> 03:14:31.820
[Guest]: right? What's the theory, right? The theory is, here's a group that is marginalized in on every

03:14:31.820 --> 03:14:36.700
[Guest]: single dimension, you can mention, right? Unlike OBCs and all, as you pointed out.

03:14:36.700 --> 03:14:45.260
[Guest]: And one instrument of addressing that marginalization has got to be giving a share

03:14:45.260 --> 03:14:50.220
[Guest]: in jobs and education. That's, that's, I mean, and partly just because of spinoff effects. I mean,

03:14:50.220 --> 03:14:57.020
[Guest]: because this is a group in some senses that was so marginalized, you've never seen a government

03:14:57.020 --> 03:15:07.340
[Guest]: officer, right? But the objective, right, is not the maintenance of a group identity, right? The

03:15:07.340 --> 03:15:12.620
[Guest]: objective is to put you in a position where you can actually exercise your individual agency like

03:15:12.620 --> 03:15:20.780
[Guest]: everybody else does. So when Dalits, you know, and it's not, I think, an accident that, you know,

03:15:20.780 --> 03:15:25.500
[Guest]: one of the reasons I think Dalits have been, Dalit movements have been such custodians of the

03:15:25.500 --> 03:15:31.980
[Guest]: constitution, not just because of the identification with Ambedkar. But because the story they want is

03:15:31.980 --> 03:15:37.500
[Guest]: not a story of, some now are beginning to articulate it after the Mandelson, but it's not a story of

03:15:37.500 --> 03:15:44.060
[Guest]: actually just power sharing and representation. It was a story of, in some sense, inclusion as

03:15:44.060 --> 03:15:50.780
[Guest]: agents and subjects, for which this happens to be an instrument, right? Now,

03:15:53.420 --> 03:15:57.020
[Guest]: there's two things that in a sense that so in principle, you can actually justify, I think,

03:15:57.020 --> 03:16:02.860
[Guest]: affirmative action of someone, right? The question then becomes, how do you design it in a way that

03:16:02.860 --> 03:16:08.220
[Guest]: actually achieves that particular objective, right? And there we, in a sense, did the kind

03:16:08.220 --> 03:16:13.580
[Guest]: of classic thing the Indian state does, lowest common denominator, simplest solution. And partly,

03:16:13.580 --> 03:16:18.620
[Guest]: we were politically wedded to it, because we were failing on all the other dimensions of inclusion,

03:16:18.620 --> 03:16:23.260
[Guest]: right? So this becomes a kind of lightning rod for mobilization.

03:16:25.820 --> 03:16:32.060
[Guest]: With the expansion of Mandal, in some senses, that inclusionary logic of affirmative action

03:16:32.060 --> 03:16:38.860
[Guest]: was now, OBCs are complicated groups, I mean, it's a very large category. But broadly speaking,

03:16:38.860 --> 03:16:45.420
[Guest]: it actually took the reservation debate into, here is a pie that needs to be divided,

03:16:46.060 --> 03:16:52.620
[Guest]: in a sense, according to the identities of people. And now we have the reductio ad absurdum of them,

03:16:52.620 --> 03:16:57.260
[Guest]: which is, you know, might as well say, you know, if they're only 5% of our castes, give them 5%

03:16:57.260 --> 03:17:04.620
[Guest]: or of that pie, right? And there were better ways of designing affirmative action. I think,

03:17:05.260 --> 03:17:11.820
[Guest]: you know, many people propose this. We were pushing for it at the Knowledge Commission

03:17:11.820 --> 03:17:20.060
[Guest]: based on Rakesh Basan's work then, which is, what if you used parents education as a proxy

03:17:20.060 --> 03:17:26.220
[Guest]: for people who are eligible for affirmative action, it would actually cover all the Dalit

03:17:26.220 --> 03:17:31.260
[Guest]: groups you need to cover, right? But in some senses, after a generation or two could be

03:17:31.260 --> 03:17:38.300
[Guest]: self-liquidating. Interestingly, JNU's multi-pronged deprivation index was actually

03:17:38.300 --> 03:17:44.540
[Guest]: an interesting way of breaking out of this mould, in some ways. And you could, you know, you could,

03:17:45.260 --> 03:17:48.700
[Guest]: you could actually tinker with it in ways in which so I actually think affirmative

03:17:48.700 --> 03:17:52.460
[Guest]: action is actually quite just but yes, the form in which we congealed it.

03:17:52.460 --> 03:17:57.980
[Guest]: And two, I think the cultural change, right, which is what happened the minute this became

03:17:57.980 --> 03:18:04.540
[Guest]: a question of just the sharing of power. The ethical dimension of it, which is the point

03:18:04.540 --> 03:18:09.260
[Guest]: is that in some senses, you should not be a prisoner of this compulsory identity,

03:18:09.900 --> 03:18:15.660
[Guest]: right? That ethical point got lost. And not just got lost. I mean, I was quite aghast,

03:18:15.660 --> 03:18:19.980
[Guest]: you know, day before yesterday, Manish Sodhia, you know, yes, the government is hounding him,

03:18:19.980 --> 03:18:23.820
[Guest]: but his first response was, I am a Rajput, I don't bow down.

03:18:25.580 --> 03:18:30.140
[Guest]: And I mean, I can understand the sentiment, but what's the implication, right? That there is a

03:18:30.140 --> 03:18:34.780
[Guest]: kind of compulsory identity of Rajputness. And you know, we slip into that quite,

03:18:36.220 --> 03:18:46.860
[Guest]: quite unconsciously, right? That the moral horror of caste, right, is that it gives everyone a

03:18:46.860 --> 03:18:53.500
[Guest]: compulsory identity where you have no control over your self-definition. Right? I mean, that's

03:18:53.500 --> 03:18:59.260
[Guest]: what makes, you know, parts of Manu like look so kind of oppressive. Why Ambedkar reacts so

03:18:59.260 --> 03:19:05.020
[Guest]: strongly to Gandhi, it's not just that Harijan is patronizing. It's the ultimate Manuwadi act

03:19:05.020 --> 03:19:11.500
[Guest]: where somebody comes and says, I'm going to name you, right? Right? No matter what you do, where

03:19:11.500 --> 03:19:16.380
[Guest]: you are, you're Harijan, right? And one of the reasons I think caste politics is so attractive

03:19:16.380 --> 03:19:21.420
[Guest]: to politicians, right? In a way in which class politics is not is because it provides a simple,

03:19:21.420 --> 03:19:28.300
[Guest]: simple metric, right? X people have graduated. If you do class, the minute you come out of your

03:19:28.300 --> 03:19:33.260
[Guest]: class, you're no longer a member of that class, right? So caste has this peculiar

03:19:34.300 --> 03:19:39.580
[Guest]: kind of feature, right? And why I think the caste census, I actually oppose the caste census,

03:19:40.380 --> 03:19:45.980
[Guest]: because I think everything that needs to be done for genuine empowerment, you can actually do

03:19:45.980 --> 03:19:50.940
[Guest]: without a census, you don't need a census for that. And it's an actually an artifact of this

03:19:50.940 --> 03:19:55.980
[Guest]: odd, and we haven't even resolved the methodological question, right? Can it be a part of

03:19:55.980 --> 03:20:00.700
[Guest]: self-definition? And if your identity cannot be part of self-definition, or not a product of

03:20:00.700 --> 03:20:07.420
[Guest]: self-definition, for the liberal state, that's almost the worst kind of identity, right? You

03:20:07.420 --> 03:20:13.900
[Guest]: don't even get the right to name who you are. Right? So I think that's where we ended up, I

03:20:13.900 --> 03:20:20.220
[Guest]: think, wrong with the caste question. The personal law question, in some ways, and you're right that

03:20:21.180 --> 03:20:28.060
[Guest]: the constitution did a compromise, it was a modus vivendi, it's conditions of partition.

03:20:29.580 --> 03:20:32.620
[Guest]: Partly, it's an act of reassurance, right, to minorities.

03:20:34.860 --> 03:20:43.020
[Guest]: The way I now think of the personal law question is, I think the question got slightly inframed

03:20:43.020 --> 03:20:49.100
[Guest]: in this terms of kind of uniform civil code. Because that, again, reinstates the question,

03:20:50.220 --> 03:20:54.940
[Guest]: whose civil code, who's defining it? Whose values get into it? And you know, when you're

03:20:54.940 --> 03:20:58.940
[Guest]: looking at things like marriage, right? I mean, I'm just trying to think of common civil code of,

03:20:58.940 --> 03:21:03.100
[Guest]: you know, marriage, cross cousin marriage, go through marriage, right? I mean, these are

03:21:03.100 --> 03:21:08.780
[Guest]: deeply met practices. The better tact to take, which I think is where the Supreme Court was

03:21:08.780 --> 03:21:15.900
[Guest]: incrementally heading, was to say that, look, there can be different kinds of variations,

03:21:16.940 --> 03:21:25.420
[Guest]: right? But all of those variations have to pass some basic tests, right? Gender equality,

03:21:26.380 --> 03:21:32.460
[Guest]: freedom of a certain kind, compatible with that, if the variation is fine, and plus,

03:21:32.460 --> 03:21:37.260
[Guest]: you can have an exit option. I mean, you can always do, you know, the special marriages act,

03:21:37.260 --> 03:21:44.140
[Guest]: right? But I think framing the common civil code around national integration was a mistake.

03:21:45.900 --> 03:21:51.500
[Guest]: Because it immediately raises the specter, will our cultural practices find a reflection in this

03:21:51.500 --> 03:21:59.660
[Guest]: nation? The commonality that we are interested in is the baseline consensus that the state has

03:21:59.660 --> 03:22:08.620
[Guest]: a compelling interest in gender equality and freedom across all laws, right? Compatible with

03:22:08.620 --> 03:22:12.940
[Guest]: that, if there are, you know, various kinds of variations and all of that, you know, that's

03:22:12.940 --> 03:22:19.740
[Guest]: something to be in a sense worked out. But the suspicion, right, that this is going to be drafted

03:22:19.740 --> 03:22:24.460
[Guest]: by a majority that's not going to consult others. And by the way, the reverse suspicion where

03:22:24.460 --> 03:22:30.140
[Guest]: Congress party's biggest mistake, to institutionally empower a body like the

03:22:30.140 --> 03:22:36.300
[Guest]: Muslim Personal Law Board, which is neither representative, nor farsighted, nor has any

03:22:36.300 --> 03:22:43.500
[Guest]: imagination, right? Partly, I think, for political reasons, the political reasons being that

03:22:43.500 --> 03:22:53.740
[Guest]: it was easier to prey on that politics of fear. The majority will, in some senses,

03:22:53.740 --> 03:22:58.620
[Guest]: ride roughshod over you. Now, that's happening anyway. But instead of being constructive about

03:22:58.620 --> 03:23:02.860
[Guest]: it, right, and Congress kind of betrayed all of these principles, particularly under Rajiv Gandhi.

03:23:03.420 --> 03:23:08.700
[Guest]: So I think that I think, I think for liberals, I think it's important to engage with the UCC debate,

03:23:08.700 --> 03:23:14.620
[Guest]: not just to a knee-jerk reaction, but bring it back to these first principles, right?

03:23:14.620 --> 03:23:20.300
[Guest]: What's the compelling core vision of the constitution that these practices in some

03:23:20.300 --> 03:23:25.900
[Guest]: senses have to and then, you know, then some senses apply that, I think, you know, symmetrically,

03:23:26.620 --> 03:23:32.860
[Guest]: you know, in some ways. I think on liberty, I actually agree with you where the two kinds

03:23:32.860 --> 03:23:40.060
[Guest]: of threats of liberty where, again, the Indian state not is not an exception. One is the kind

03:23:40.060 --> 03:23:44.940
[Guest]: of inflation of threats to national security and public order as pretext for containing curtailing

03:23:44.940 --> 03:23:53.580
[Guest]: civil rights, which again, all states have done. But the second, I am a near absolutist in free

03:23:53.580 --> 03:24:01.340
[Guest]: speech, unless there's direct incitement to violence. I think the presence of a category

03:24:01.340 --> 03:24:07.020
[Guest]: that looks like blasphemy, right, if it's an operational category in law, I mean,

03:24:07.020 --> 03:24:10.380
[Guest]: you have states like England, where it existed in the books, but you know,

03:24:10.380 --> 03:24:17.660
[Guest]: nobody bothered for it for quite a while, is actually a disaster for liberal societies.

03:24:19.340 --> 03:24:25.340
[Guest]: And it's a disaster in two ways. One, because it suggests the kind of basic lack of trust,

03:24:25.340 --> 03:24:31.580
[Guest]: which is the underlying discourse of that article, right? We are such mad people,

03:24:31.580 --> 03:24:35.500
[Guest]: we will get so triggered, right, that large scale violence is going to follow.

03:24:37.260 --> 03:24:40.460
[Guest]: But we fail to consider the reverse possibility that large scale violence,

03:24:41.020 --> 03:24:45.660
[Guest]: right, once you also follows from the fact that people can actually mobilize to get things banned,

03:24:45.660 --> 03:24:48.860
[Guest]: and then it becomes a competitive race between communities. So I think a very,

03:24:48.860 --> 03:24:52.300
[Guest]: very strong norm, right? And why, for instance, in the Nupur Sharma case,

03:24:52.300 --> 03:24:59.820
[Guest]: I think it was important to say that as a functionary of the BJP, right,

03:25:00.700 --> 03:25:07.580
[Guest]: the manner of articulation should not suggest that minorities are stigmatized and arguments

03:25:07.580 --> 03:25:13.420
[Guest]: about my mother weaponized in that way. But I actually don't think there's a case for arresting

03:25:13.420 --> 03:25:21.420
[Guest]: her. I think that's where, again, we liberals jump right into the trap. Right? So you reach

03:25:21.420 --> 03:25:25.020
[Guest]: a point where these kinds of utterances become a kind of matter of fact where, you know,

03:25:25.660 --> 03:25:31.660
[Guest]: somebody says, nobody actually pays attention to them. But by having a law, you are ensuring,

03:25:32.460 --> 03:25:38.060
[Guest]: right, that, you know, these get rid. By the way, this is not just true with this. I mean,

03:25:38.060 --> 03:25:44.940
[Guest]: you just look at what's happening in Punjab. I mean, Punjab has a blasphemy law, the SGPCs

03:25:44.940 --> 03:25:52.380
[Guest]: is cracked down in some senses of even legitimate scholars who work on Sikhism

03:25:52.380 --> 03:25:55.820
[Guest]: is actually a story that's not been written about enough. So there's all these kind of

03:25:55.820 --> 03:26:03.180
[Guest]: reverberating effects, Basaveshra's followers in Karnataka, right? So we just I think,

03:26:03.180 --> 03:26:09.020
[Guest]: I think we need to, in some senses, I think, show more trust. It's not going to be seamless.

03:26:09.020 --> 03:26:13.820
[Guest]: But we have locked ourselves into a vicious cycle, which is only, I think, deepened

03:26:13.820 --> 03:26:17.180
[Guest]: with every, again, you know, being stuck in a 1930s paradigm.

03:26:18.380 --> 03:26:23.020
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, I agree with you on all of this. And you said you're a near free speech absolutist

03:26:23.020 --> 03:26:28.700
[Amit Varma]: and you're near me because I'm an absolutist. And I agree with you about the liberal hypocrisy

03:26:28.700 --> 03:26:34.620
[Amit Varma]: about this. I mean, you know, if you think 295A and 153A are bad, they should not be there,

03:26:34.620 --> 03:26:38.940
[Amit Varma]: they should not be there, then that's it. That's the end of the story. But you can't say that, hey,

03:26:38.940 --> 03:26:43.580
[Amit Varma]: you know, don't use it on us, but use it for Annab Goswami, use it for Nupur Sharma that

03:26:43.580 --> 03:26:51.180
[Amit Varma]: simply does not compute and just tremendous. No, I said near absolute, just in the sense that,

03:26:51.180 --> 03:26:56.220
[Guest]: you know, absolute has a kind of connotation where, you know, even normal taught wrongs

03:26:56.220 --> 03:27:02.220
[Guest]: are not actually covered by that. So, you know, but I suspect on every issue, we'll be all probably

03:27:02.220 --> 03:27:06.940
[Amit Varma]: on the same on free speech. No, and I'm exactly with you on the issue of reservations as well.

03:27:06.940 --> 03:27:12.300
[Amit Varma]: You know, the objectives and the rationale behind reservations for Dalits were fantastic. But if you

03:27:12.300 --> 03:27:18.060
[Amit Varma]: look at the outcomes and the way they turned out, you know, I agree with you about the design. But

03:27:18.060 --> 03:27:26.380
[Amit Varma]: the thing is that tool became a political tool eventually. And I wonder if it ended up solidifying

03:27:26.380 --> 03:27:33.100
[Amit Varma]: these identities in people minds like caste is incredibly toxic it is and what you want to do

03:27:33.100 --> 03:27:38.460
[Amit Varma]: is you want to fight as effectively as you can. And I think part of the danger was part of the

03:27:38.460 --> 03:27:43.740
[Amit Varma]: danger of any kind of top down thinking is that up in a law banalia and the law is there and you

03:27:43.740 --> 03:27:50.620
[Amit Varma]: think our job is done, it's over. But the point is a top down law is going to be incredibly ineffective

03:27:51.500 --> 03:27:56.140
[Amit Varma]: and be you know, then that social change simply isn't happening. We needed that social change

03:27:56.140 --> 03:28:01.580
[Amit Varma]: and I wonder if our thinking about it was and it's easy to say this in hindsight, obviously.

03:28:01.580 --> 03:28:07.500
[Guest]: No, but I think a couple of nuances I think on reservation for Dalits, I think I have a slightly

03:28:09.100 --> 03:28:13.420
[Guest]: different, it's not incompatible, but I think one nuance, you know, when we say solidified caste,

03:28:15.900 --> 03:28:20.380
[Guest]: I think we actually have to acknowledge the fact that a lot of that solidification actually comes

03:28:20.380 --> 03:28:27.740
[Guest]: from upper caste backlash that refuses to acknowledge this reality. Actually, it's not

03:28:27.740 --> 03:28:31.900
[Guest]: as much as if Dalits kind of, you know, yes, for political sense, but in some ways, I think,

03:28:32.460 --> 03:28:36.780
[Guest]: I actually do think there's a kind of asymmetry there, at least what I see on college campuses,

03:28:36.780 --> 03:28:39.900
[Guest]: in some ways, I mean, obviously, in India, you can't escape caste, but I think

03:28:41.260 --> 03:28:46.380
[Guest]: the solidification that has come from the resentment that I have to deal with this

03:28:46.380 --> 03:28:51.020
[Guest]: problem, I think that's actually, and it's a much more insidious form of solidification

03:28:51.020 --> 03:28:55.500
[Guest]: than a traditional and I think it has to be said that I think a lot of the mechanism of

03:28:55.500 --> 03:29:00.540
[Guest]: solidification, like in the US, in some senses, solidification of white identity actually comes

03:29:00.540 --> 03:29:07.100
[Guest]: from that. We don't want to share this power or innocence, share this space. I think the second

03:29:07.100 --> 03:29:17.580
[Guest]: thing, I think, in the case of Dalit reservations is that, you know, it has at the margins, I think,

03:29:17.580 --> 03:29:23.180
[Guest]: created avenues for mobility, which are beginning to have backchannel effects. I mean, you know,

03:29:24.860 --> 03:29:29.180
[Guest]: I think if our friend Chandraban was here, he has a particular take on this in some ways, right,

03:29:29.180 --> 03:29:37.660
[Guest]: which is that, in the case of Dalits, you urgently needed to create even the minimal resources,

03:29:37.660 --> 03:29:44.140
[Guest]: educational, to actually even think of the slightest forms of mobility, right. So, right.

03:29:45.020 --> 03:29:49.340
[Guest]: And you could argue that some of that has actually happened in some ways that, you know, in some

03:29:49.340 --> 03:29:54.300
[Guest]: senses, even the Dalit entrepreneurs that he's writing about, right. And many of them, by the

03:29:54.300 --> 03:29:58.060
[Guest]: way, don't want reservation for themselves and their kids. And there is, you know, so in that

03:29:58.060 --> 03:30:03.900
[Guest]: sense, I don't think for them, it's this kind of solidified story. But the fact that there were

03:30:03.900 --> 03:30:09.340
[Guest]: examples and the fact that this is, I think, an enabling step. I think the scandal, I think,

03:30:09.340 --> 03:30:17.500
[Guest]: of reservations is that, and this I can say, you know, very apparent when I was on the Knowledge

03:30:17.500 --> 03:30:25.980
[Guest]: Commission. Absolutely everybody in India gets mobilized on the issue of access, low fees,

03:30:25.980 --> 03:30:33.660
[Guest]: you know, affirmative action, impossible to get anybody mobilized on education quality.

03:30:35.260 --> 03:30:43.820
[Guest]: And access to us became that substitute for, you know, quality in some ways, right. And as time

03:30:43.820 --> 03:30:49.020
[Guest]: went on, so more and more weight was actually placed on the access story. You know, in that

03:30:49.020 --> 03:30:54.780
[Guest]: we are achieving quality is a kind of miracle, you know, in the sense that lots of little nooks and

03:30:54.780 --> 03:31:03.500
[Guest]: crannies allowed us escape all. But the quality story, and the quality story was, in fact, you

03:31:03.500 --> 03:31:07.660
[Guest]: know, often used against Dalits, right? I mean, this whole question of, you know, they're not

03:31:07.660 --> 03:31:12.940
[Guest]: enough qualified Dalits. I mean, frankly, in our context, if you're sincere about that,

03:31:14.460 --> 03:31:20.700
[Guest]: you first have to show what your record is on improving public schools, improving the quality

03:31:20.700 --> 03:31:27.740
[Guest]: of education. Otherwise, that's just a weapon to basically argue for the unfairness of reservation.

03:31:27.740 --> 03:31:31.260
[Guest]: I mean, it's, you know, pitting the plumage but forgetting the dying bird.

03:31:31.900 --> 03:31:36.700
[Amit Varma]: It's a circular argument that traps them in a vicious circle. I agree about that. But what I

03:31:36.700 --> 03:31:42.620
[Amit Varma]: meant by solidifying identity was not in the case of Dalits per se, but what reservations later

03:31:42.620 --> 03:31:48.300
[Amit Varma]: became when it got expanded to various landowning costs, and so on and so forth, where it just

03:31:48.300 --> 03:31:53.260
[Amit Varma]: became, you know, one more tool that you use in electoral politics to build vote banks, and so on

03:31:53.260 --> 03:31:59.820
[Amit Varma]: and so forth. And, you know, but actually, it's deeper than that. I mean, I think you're right

03:31:59.820 --> 03:32:03.660
[Guest]: about it, because what I've been actually struck by, you know, so there's this nice sociological

03:32:03.660 --> 03:32:11.660
[Guest]: story, we told ourselves that caste will move from hierarchy to identity, right? And in some senses,

03:32:12.620 --> 03:32:17.580
[Guest]: that's really an achievement, because it takes away from the hierarchical purity pollution aspects.

03:32:17.580 --> 03:32:24.940
[Guest]: It's a way of organizing group identity. I think the horror to my mind of that story,

03:32:24.940 --> 03:32:28.860
[Guest]: the way it has happened in India is, in a sense, the compulsory character of it.

03:32:30.060 --> 03:32:36.220
[Guest]: That the kinds of identities that liberal society values and values should valorize

03:32:36.220 --> 03:32:39.740
[Guest]: the freedom for people to, in some senses, choose and create identities.

03:32:39.740 --> 03:32:46.780
[Guest]: But the kind of identities that we have created, its compulsory character,

03:32:46.780 --> 03:32:50.060
[Guest]: right, which is, which is, in a sense, your measure, no matter it kind of all parts of the

03:32:50.060 --> 03:32:57.660
[Guest]: spectrum, right. And that now has even more insidious form, right? It's been given legal

03:32:57.660 --> 03:33:04.780
[Guest]: form in some ways, right? I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's a, and how you can create a liberal

03:33:04.780 --> 03:33:12.140
[Guest]: society that doesn't open up the possibility of self-definition, I think, is, is, should worry us.

03:33:16.140 --> 03:33:21.420
[Amit Varma]: Yes, so here's a question. And here's a thought that kind of gives me some amount of despair,

03:33:21.420 --> 03:33:27.180
[Amit Varma]: which is we have all these fault lines in Indian society, right? It was almost a matter of faith

03:33:27.180 --> 03:33:31.980
[Amit Varma]: at one point for our liberal elites that look, number one, we will, you know, create these

03:33:31.980 --> 03:33:37.260
[Amit Varma]: top-down interventions to solve these problems. And number two, society will modernize over time,

03:33:37.260 --> 03:33:42.060
[Amit Varma]: we'll get prosperous, things will get better, these fissures will disappear. Now, what we see

03:33:42.060 --> 03:33:46.860
[Amit Varma]: with the anti-Muslim nature of modern politics, which more than one party subscribes to,

03:33:46.860 --> 03:33:51.900
[Amit Varma]: is that that really hasn't happened. If anything, they've kind of deepened. We see the same thing

03:33:51.900 --> 03:33:55.260
[Amit Varma]: with caste, we see more assertion of it, like, so somebody is standing up and saying he's a

03:33:55.260 --> 03:34:02.220
[Amit Varma]: Rajput, and so on and so forth. You know, that's, if anything, it's, it's sort of become stronger.

03:34:02.220 --> 03:34:04.540
[Amit Varma]: So where does progress then come from?

03:34:05.580 --> 03:34:12.700
[Guest]: I mean, in the longer sweep, I think the story is a bit more mixed. And let me take one, begin

03:34:12.700 --> 03:34:16.380
[Guest]: with a different example, because it might have some bearing on actually these two as well, which

03:34:16.380 --> 03:34:25.020
[Guest]: is, you know, the one piece of good news that has come in the last week or so, which is India's

03:34:25.020 --> 03:34:34.540
[Guest]: India is inching back towards a normal sex ratio at birth, right? I know India's female

03:34:34.540 --> 03:34:40.860
[Guest]: labour force participation is abysmally low. But I actually think in 10 years, the story will be

03:34:40.860 --> 03:34:45.260
[Guest]: very different. I mean, I mean, you can almost sense the pressure of social change. You just

03:34:45.260 --> 03:34:49.020
[Guest]: look at any educational institution, you just look at that, you know, this kind of stuff,

03:34:49.020 --> 03:34:56.780
[Guest]: it's taking longer than it should. And often, you know, the lag between enrolment and participation

03:34:56.780 --> 03:35:02.780
[Guest]: is 15 to 10 to 15 years, partly because maybe people are investing in their children. So,

03:35:03.660 --> 03:35:09.500
[Guest]: so it's actually a good example, right? And one can be kind of cynical about it. But I actually

03:35:09.500 --> 03:35:15.580
[Guest]: saw in Haryana, you know, one of the most kind of patriarchal states in some ways, a kind of

03:35:15.580 --> 03:35:24.140
[Guest]: poster child. The beti bachao, beti padhao was not insincere across social and political spectrums.

03:35:24.140 --> 03:35:26.780
[Guest]: That doesn't mean violence is stopped. That doesn't mean honour killings are not going to

03:35:26.780 --> 03:35:31.100
[Guest]: happen. That doesn't mean you know, but so here's a kind of interesting example of actually a

03:35:31.740 --> 03:35:37.900
[Guest]: pretty deep and significant long term change that in some senses, I think, churning.

03:35:37.900 --> 03:35:49.260
[Guest]: Right. I think with caste, right. So you could tell a kind of benign story,

03:35:50.220 --> 03:35:53.900
[Guest]: which would go something like this, that again, what we are seeing at the moment

03:35:55.740 --> 03:36:01.180
[Guest]: is the lag between that political paradigm we had for the last 20-30 years and the actual

03:36:01.180 --> 03:36:06.700
[Guest]: social changes. So two things are already beginning, three things in the caste politics,

03:36:06.700 --> 03:36:14.220
[Guest]: right? One, the logic of caste now is de-agglomeration, right, which is already

03:36:14.220 --> 03:36:19.100
[Guest]: a kind of acknowledgement that that paradigm of classification didn't quite work. So now you have

03:36:19.100 --> 03:36:23.020
[Guest]: to have EBCs, now you have to add other criteria. So it's a kind of splintering of caste.

03:36:24.700 --> 03:36:33.340
[Guest]: Two, you're beginning to see a lot more splintering of voting choices, right? I mean,

03:36:33.340 --> 03:36:40.300
[Guest]: as much as you and I might hate Dalit groups voting for the BJP, at another level, it actually

03:36:40.300 --> 03:36:46.780
[Guest]: does signify something deep, right? Not just the fact that they think the BJP is not an obstacle,

03:36:46.780 --> 03:36:53.260
[Guest]: even if it's not, you know, fully empowering, but the identification between caste and party. Now,

03:36:53.260 --> 03:36:58.940
[Guest]: it still exists. I mean, you know, UP upper caste will predominantly 80% penetration of the BJP and

03:36:58.940 --> 03:37:06.300
[Guest]: stuff. But I actually think the voting story is a lot more fluid and will get fluid. And now again,

03:37:06.300 --> 03:37:10.460
[Guest]: it's endogenous. I mean, it's endogenous in the sense that if there's a plausible alternative

03:37:10.460 --> 03:37:14.940
[Guest]: coalition, people gravitate to it. If there's nothing on offer, then caste is a kind of default

03:37:14.940 --> 03:37:18.220
[Guest]: thing. I mean, if I know you're not, nobody's going to give me governance, I might as well get,

03:37:18.220 --> 03:37:25.980
[Guest]: you know, three of my buddies in government or something, right? And the shifting coalitions,

03:37:25.980 --> 03:37:32.860
[Guest]: in a sense around caste, right? So I think, I think that's, I think, I think a little bit in

03:37:32.860 --> 03:37:37.660
[Guest]: the sense of opening up. And the third thing, in a sense that that will happen, right, which is,

03:37:39.740 --> 03:37:45.820
[Guest]: you know, a lot of the articulation of the kind of liberal ideas, not the practice of liberalism,

03:37:45.820 --> 03:37:55.500
[Guest]: but ideas. It is historically required a kind of much bigger middle class, right? Now, up till now,

03:37:55.500 --> 03:37:59.740
[Guest]: most of us did not have to face this question, because other than in education institutions,

03:37:59.740 --> 03:38:03.740
[Guest]: because of reservation, we actually never actually had to encounter the question of sharing same

03:38:03.740 --> 03:38:09.740
[Guest]: spaces and all of that. And the fact that the focus is getting back on to things like discrimination

03:38:09.740 --> 03:38:16.300
[Guest]: and stuff, it may actually force a kind of different kind of conversation. Generationally,

03:38:16.300 --> 03:38:22.220
[Guest]: it may force a different kind of conversation, where you hope, I mean, let's see, does even

03:38:22.220 --> 03:38:30.380
[Guest]: politically, Tejasvi, do Tejasvi and Akhilesh, think of caste and politics somewhat differently,

03:38:30.380 --> 03:38:36.940
[Guest]: they're not going to give up on the caste story, right? But it's no longer that, you know,

03:38:38.460 --> 03:38:44.700
[Guest]: caste, dignity, or nothing else, program that Lalu ran on. So I actually think there are kind of

03:38:44.700 --> 03:38:49.340
[Guest]: exogenous changes. And I think on this Chandrabhan is right, this is the more economic churn you

03:38:49.340 --> 03:38:55.180
[Guest]: create, it opens up different possibilities. I'm not saying, I'm not an economic determinist,

03:38:55.180 --> 03:39:00.300
[Guest]: we know from the US experience, that, you know, categories like race and caste can be very,

03:39:00.300 --> 03:39:05.660
[Guest]: very sticky. But for years, you just didn't even have the basic raw material,

03:39:06.540 --> 03:39:13.180
[Guest]: to which to, in some senses, reconfigure all of this. So I suspect, you know, this is one place

03:39:13.180 --> 03:39:19.340
[Guest]: where you might get more progress. The Hindu Muslim thing, frankly, gives me the nightmares.

03:39:21.020 --> 03:39:29.260
[Guest]: It gives me the nightmares, because I see its normative entrenchment, like, so with caste,

03:39:29.260 --> 03:39:35.100
[Guest]: for all the, you know, social practices about caste, nobody kind of normatively defends,

03:39:36.060 --> 03:39:39.340
[Guest]: you know, we should return to caste society or something. Well, it's communalism, we do,

03:39:39.340 --> 03:39:43.900
[Guest]: I mean, that, you know, you can, so its normative entrenchment is much deeper.

03:39:45.020 --> 03:39:53.420
[Guest]: The kind of political narrative of fear that you need to sustain an anti-Muslim political outlook,

03:39:55.100 --> 03:40:00.380
[Guest]: that kind of material is very readily available. I mean, it takes one blasphemy incident. And,

03:40:00.380 --> 03:40:06.060
[Guest]: you know, we can talk about the short term victory of, you know, BJP having to expel three MLAs.

03:40:06.060 --> 03:40:10.220
[Guest]: Trust me, this is going to be an underground resentment, right?

03:40:12.220 --> 03:40:15.580
[Guest]: You have, in some sense, it's Pakistan, right? So,

03:40:17.980 --> 03:40:26.620
[Guest]: the objective conditions where Hindu nationalism creates a kind of climate of fear,

03:40:27.980 --> 03:40:34.940
[Guest]: magnifies what is actually not really as big a threat, right? Those conditions are actually

03:40:34.940 --> 03:40:40.220
[Guest]: more likely to obtain now in some ways, right? So, there's enough fodder for them, as it were,

03:40:40.220 --> 03:40:47.020
[Guest]: right? I think, in a way. Third thing in some ways, right, which is that, and this is where the

03:40:49.260 --> 03:40:53.260
[Guest]: question of power sharing with Muslims has always been complicated in the Indian context,

03:40:54.780 --> 03:41:02.780
[Guest]: that there's often a convergence between a certain kind of liberal and Hindu nationalism,

03:41:02.780 --> 03:41:08.300
[Guest]: right? I mean, Lala Lajpat Rai was actually as good a liberal as you can get in many respects,

03:41:08.300 --> 03:41:15.340
[Guest]: right? But the narrative of both, the construction of a Muslim otherness,

03:41:16.460 --> 03:41:23.740
[Guest]: where you say, look, there's something about this community that is going to make them

03:41:24.460 --> 03:41:29.340
[Guest]: more resistant to liberal norms than anybody else. Now, I actually don't believe that construction.

03:41:29.340 --> 03:41:37.260
[Guest]: I don't believe that construction. But the over determination of the ideological sources from

03:41:37.260 --> 03:41:43.820
[Guest]: which people come, I think, makes it a harder problem to deal with, which is why I think it's

03:41:43.820 --> 03:41:47.980
[Guest]: important for liberals to get their first principles right on this, you know, because

03:41:48.700 --> 03:41:57.740
[Guest]: the pseudo secularism charge, right, is something that we need to diffuse, I think, by our conduct.

03:41:57.740 --> 03:42:02.540
[Guest]: And unfortunately, as you rightly said, no political party is going to do it for us. I mean,

03:42:02.540 --> 03:42:08.060
[Guest]: that's the real danger part where you, for the first time since independence, you do not have

03:42:08.060 --> 03:42:15.420
[Guest]: a single political party that can, even on basic empathy grounds, say, in a civilized society,

03:42:16.060 --> 03:42:19.740
[Guest]: it's our job to make sure that nobody is targeted for being who they are.

03:42:21.100 --> 03:42:26.220
[Guest]: First time, no political, I actually, I'm even beginning to doubt whether TMC will do this

03:42:26.220 --> 03:42:30.860
[Amit Varma]: in the near future. Yeah, it's tragic. I should point out to listeners that since you've referred

03:42:30.860 --> 03:42:36.780
[Amit Varma]: to recent events, we will be recording this on August 24, it will come out a bit later. So,

03:42:36.780 --> 03:42:40.780
[Amit Varma]: you know, just to keep that in mind, I did, by the way, invite Chandrabhan Prasad to the show

03:42:40.780 --> 03:42:45.660
[Amit Varma]: during this trip. But the moment he heard I wanted five hours of his time, he was just very firm. He

03:42:45.660 --> 03:42:51.020
[Amit Varma]: said, No, sir, please excuse leave me out of it. And I was like, it'd be fun. He's fun. If you can,

03:42:51.020 --> 03:42:55.420
[Amit Varma]: I would really appreciate it. Because that's one episode I really, really want to do. But

03:42:55.420 --> 03:42:59.340
[Amit Varma]: regardless of whether he comes on the show or not, I'd urge all my listeners to read his books and

03:42:59.340 --> 03:43:07.420
[Amit Varma]: read his writing. A great thinker. And yeah, and you know, the thing to note about caste,

03:43:07.420 --> 03:43:11.020
[Amit Varma]: which I keep thinking about and which I think elite discourse misses is that more Dalits voted

03:43:11.020 --> 03:43:17.180
[Amit Varma]: for BJP in 2014 and 2019 than for any other party, you know, and and that's a revealed preference.

03:43:17.180 --> 03:43:24.460
[Amit Varma]: So there's clearly something happening there, which is sort of interesting. But, you know,

03:43:24.460 --> 03:43:32.380
[Amit Varma]: the anti Muslim stuff, it leaves me speechless. And what especially worries me is the inevitable

03:43:32.380 --> 03:43:37.580
[Amit Varma]: consequence of what you wrote about as a BJP is long term strategy, which you termed heads weave

03:43:37.580 --> 03:43:42.540
[Amit Varma]: and tails you lose. And the point there was that you do all this macho anti Muslim posturing,

03:43:42.540 --> 03:43:46.860
[Amit Varma]: you're getting brownie points from your people. But the moment there is any backlash,

03:43:46.860 --> 03:43:51.420
[Amit Varma]: you can use that to claim victimhood. And you can then, you know, double down on that.

03:43:51.420 --> 03:43:56.700
[Amit Varma]: And that worries me enormously. It you know, so far, the Muslims of India and I hate to speak

03:43:56.700 --> 03:44:00.940
[Amit Varma]: of anyone in a collective sense, but so far, the Muslims of India have been incredibly tolerant and

03:44:00.940 --> 03:44:07.660
[Amit Varma]: graceful in the face of an incredible amount of provocation. But it just takes one random guy,

03:44:08.380 --> 03:44:13.340
[Amit Varma]: breaking down not being able to do, you know, take it anymore and doing something rash.

03:44:13.340 --> 03:44:18.140
[Amit Varma]: And then a video of that can just go all over WhatsApp. And you know, that can be the spark

03:44:18.140 --> 03:44:23.580
[Amit Varma]: and you can light the fire. And that scares me a lot to the extent that that is not in anybody's

03:44:23.580 --> 03:44:30.700
[Amit Varma]: control anymore. It is not as if the Prime Minister was to decide that this must not happen.

03:44:30.700 --> 03:44:33.740
[Amit Varma]: Well, sorry, he doesn't control this anymore. He can't ride this tiger.

03:44:34.940 --> 03:44:39.420
[Guest]: So there's two things about that. I'll point slightly differently. That is actually the

03:44:39.420 --> 03:44:44.540
[Guest]: thing that gives me nightmares. I actually do think by the way, I still believe that

03:44:44.540 --> 03:44:50.060
[Guest]: when this Indian state wants to control stuff, it can, it actually can. I mean, it's, you know,

03:44:50.060 --> 03:44:55.500
[Guest]: which is why we've kind of, I mean, there's almost no right that doesn't happen without

03:44:55.500 --> 03:45:00.620
[Guest]: some kind of active state abdication or participation. I mean, it's not that it can

03:45:00.620 --> 03:45:06.780
[Guest]: kind of, you know, it can stop it from alter, but it can actually, you know, limit its impact and

03:45:06.780 --> 03:45:12.700
[Guest]: limit its scope, right. But the worrying thing is precisely that it doesn't look like the ruling

03:45:12.700 --> 03:45:16.940
[Guest]: dispensation will have an incentive to do that. That's one, or if it is an incentive,

03:45:16.940 --> 03:45:22.780
[Guest]: it will be a very tactical one for a particular context. But the second thing that's worrying me,

03:45:22.780 --> 03:45:28.620
[Guest]: right, and that's the larger context of our democracy, where, you know, this is also happening

03:45:28.620 --> 03:45:40.060
[Guest]: at a time where you both have a greater institutionalization of this kind of

03:45:40.060 --> 03:45:44.780
[Guest]: of this kind of communalism in different branches of the state as a very active state project. I

03:45:44.780 --> 03:45:49.340
[Guest]: mean, a kind of unconscious half-baked communalism is always part of the state,

03:45:50.140 --> 03:45:59.340
[Guest]: in some states more than others. But I'm less and less confident now that you can trust the

03:45:59.340 --> 03:46:03.820
[Guest]: key organs of the state where if the signal was right, they would actually do the right thing.

03:46:05.020 --> 03:46:08.940
[Guest]: I mean, I think in that sense, there's a kind of longer term, you know, whether it's judges,

03:46:08.940 --> 03:46:14.220
[Guest]: whether it's bureaucrats, possibly people even said they're just the armed forces, right? So,

03:46:15.020 --> 03:46:18.780
[Guest]: it gives you a very different kind of institutional power, right? That's, I think, one thing.

03:46:19.660 --> 03:46:24.220
[Guest]: The second thing, I think, is that, you know, given the way with which

03:46:24.940 --> 03:46:30.380
[Guest]: the government is going after the opposition now. So, if you ask the question about democracy,

03:46:32.380 --> 03:46:35.340
[Guest]: and as much as we decry professional politicians,

03:46:35.340 --> 03:46:39.100
[Guest]: every democracy is sustained by professional politicians. And by professional politicians,

03:46:40.940 --> 03:46:45.980
[Guest]: we mean a couple of things, a group of people who understand themselves to be members of a

03:46:45.980 --> 03:46:52.140
[Guest]: political class and acknowledge each other as members of a political class

03:46:53.340 --> 03:47:00.540
[Guest]: and play by a certain kind of certain rules of the game. Now, that can have its downsides. I mean,

03:47:00.540 --> 03:47:06.620
[Guest]: one of the downsides was, for example, you do not prosecute anybody in politics. We always used to

03:47:06.620 --> 03:47:11.340
[Guest]: say politicians get away scot-free. But in a way, that was part of that mutual reciprocity.

03:47:13.420 --> 03:47:19.260
[Guest]: If you look at the breakdown of democracies, once you have a hyper-ideological regime in power,

03:47:21.820 --> 03:47:26.780
[Guest]: and it has, in a sense, broken that professional norm, right?

03:47:26.780 --> 03:47:35.180
[Guest]: One should not assume that it will give up power easily, even if you think you can actually get it

03:47:35.180 --> 03:47:41.100
[Guest]: to lose in an election, right? Because you've already created this deep state apparatus,

03:47:41.660 --> 03:47:47.100
[Guest]: right? Which will allow, I mean, some will be opportunistic, some will shift. But surely,

03:47:47.100 --> 03:47:53.500
[Guest]: I think, given what India has gone through the last seven or eight years, it will allow

03:47:53.500 --> 03:47:58.780
[Guest]: the ruling establishment to do the same. If you were part of that establishment,

03:47:58.780 --> 03:48:03.980
[Guest]: you cannot now assume it's one IAS officer, another IAS officer, we just rotate like we used to,

03:48:03.980 --> 03:48:09.900
[Guest]: right? The kind of prosecution the ruling establishment would fear,

03:48:11.020 --> 03:48:19.180
[Guest]: if there's a genuine opposition victory, right? You could argue that that substantially reduces

03:48:19.180 --> 03:48:27.100
[Guest]: their investment in acquiescing to a peaceful transition of power. And I think this is a

03:48:27.100 --> 03:48:32.780
[Guest]: danger that we are facing for the first time in Indian democracy. And it's hard to kind of

03:48:32.780 --> 03:48:36.540
[Guest]: articulate it, because we haven't had a past kind of precedence. I mean, you could argue emergency

03:48:36.540 --> 03:48:45.420
[Guest]: 75. But all the signs are the ruling dispensation is putting itself in a position where it will be

03:48:45.420 --> 03:48:50.620
[Guest]: very difficult for its carders, its party, its leadership, to actually accept a peaceful

03:48:50.620 --> 03:48:57.980
[Guest]: transition of power. So you may be in a position where mere electoral dissatisfaction, unless it's

03:48:57.980 --> 03:49:04.940
[Guest]: like some massive thing that, you know, you kind of just really scare them. But even if it's a

03:49:04.940 --> 03:49:08.780
[Guest]: close election, we've already seen that in the US, right? I mean, the legitimacy of the election

03:49:08.780 --> 03:49:16.380
[Guest]: impugned. That's a very distinctive possibility in India now. The German political theorist,

03:49:16.380 --> 03:49:20.620
[Amit Varma]: Carl Schmitt, once said that in politics, you need an other, right? What we are seeing in India,

03:49:20.620 --> 03:49:24.860
[Amit Varma]: in a sense is, of course, Muslims are the other, that's something playing out at the social level.

03:49:24.860 --> 03:49:30.540
[Amit Varma]: But in politics, the BJP has pretty much, you know, it's virtually created a Congress

03:49:30.540 --> 03:49:36.780
[Amit Varma]: Mugbharat as it wish to and there's practically no opposition. So there is a sense and, you know,

03:49:36.780 --> 03:49:42.300
[Amit Varma]: I've seen traces of it in the rabbit holes, I've gone down on the extreme right wing rabbit holes,

03:49:42.860 --> 03:49:47.500
[Amit Varma]: that the opposition will really come from within, like already we speak about the fault lines

03:49:47.500 --> 03:49:52.220
[Amit Varma]: between Trads and Raitas as they are called, you know, Trads being the completely traditional

03:49:52.220 --> 03:49:58.540
[Amit Varma]: hug back to good old Hinduism, whatever that was, and so on and so forth. Do you have the sense that

03:50:00.140 --> 03:50:05.340
[Amit Varma]: it could play out that way that the splintering will happen from within that, you know, rather

03:50:05.340 --> 03:50:10.140
[Amit Varma]: than from without because without there really is not much of an opposition right now?

03:50:10.140 --> 03:50:16.060
[Guest]: I'm less convinced that you'll get the splintering. One again, maybe we are too close to the present

03:50:16.060 --> 03:50:22.140
[Guest]: moment, but and maybe this is acknowledging your point about how we see the importance of

03:50:22.140 --> 03:50:27.820
[Guest]: ideology here, as opposed to what people fear most. It's like the Republican Party in the US,

03:50:29.020 --> 03:50:34.300
[Guest]: nobody defected, right? You would have thought Trump was anti-evangelical. So this Trads and

03:50:34.300 --> 03:50:41.100
[Guest]: Raitas thing is a Twitter discourse, honestly, politically is useless. I think as a kind of

03:50:41.100 --> 03:50:46.060
[Guest]: articulation of a possible political movement, you know, somebody saying this is not traditional

03:50:46.060 --> 03:50:52.460
[Guest]: Hinduism, this is, you know, some violent, aggressive, non-traditional revolutionary

03:50:52.460 --> 03:51:00.700
[Guest]: doctrine, right? A, I don't think that's going to happen. B, I think it's a bit it's early days.

03:51:00.700 --> 03:51:11.020
[Guest]: Remember, yes, human nature is ambitious. But the BJP's had longer socialization mechanisms

03:51:12.060 --> 03:51:15.900
[Guest]: than I think almost, it's the kind of socialized message and mechanism that the Congress Party did,

03:51:15.900 --> 03:51:21.100
[Guest]: right? Where you could argue, I mean, look, do the counterfactual if Patel and Nehru had split,

03:51:21.820 --> 03:51:26.300
[Guest]: literally split. Or if Nehru had gone with Subash and split with Gandhi,

03:51:26.300 --> 03:51:32.540
[Guest]: an international movement could have collapsed. I actually still think if you look at the cast

03:51:32.540 --> 03:51:39.580
[Guest]: of characters, I mean, whatever their other faults, their ambitions will certainly come into play.

03:51:41.340 --> 03:51:47.020
[Guest]: But, and there will be differences. But I think it's too premature to conclude that this is just

03:51:47.020 --> 03:51:53.100
[Guest]: going to be another like factional fight. The third thing I think about that, which is

03:51:53.100 --> 03:51:56.780
[Guest]: there's just a speculative possibility, which is, suppose there were to be a split.

03:51:58.540 --> 03:52:03.980
[Guest]: Does the process of creating that split actually radicalize the party even more and make it worse?

03:52:04.940 --> 03:52:10.140
[Guest]: Because we know, I mean, this is often the case with extremist organizations, right? The way

03:52:10.140 --> 03:52:17.420
[Guest]: you claim your legitimacy is by outflanking whatever slivers of moderation you might have,

03:52:17.420 --> 03:52:23.660
[Guest]: right? That gives other parties an opening, but it doesn't necessarily actually mean that the

03:52:23.660 --> 03:52:30.060
[Guest]: outcome of that splintering is actually less violent or any good. And this is true of any

03:52:30.060 --> 03:52:34.620
[Guest]: religious base. I mean, you can look at the Akalis, you can look at, you know, that the

03:52:34.620 --> 03:52:38.860
[Guest]: splintering, because it'll have to legitimize itself. And if you're in the BJP, the only way

03:52:38.860 --> 03:52:43.500
[Guest]: you legitimize yourself is by saying, you know, humne hindu to agenda poora nahi kiya,

03:52:43.500 --> 03:52:54.140
[Amit Varma]: No, that move to the extremes is what I worry about in the sense that it's an inevitable

03:52:54.140 --> 03:52:58.380
[Amit Varma]: logic of modern politics. I think that the way you stand out in your own party is by,

03:52:59.180 --> 03:53:04.540
[Amit Varma]: you know, being purer than the purest. And to my mind, those horrific videos that emerged

03:53:04.540 --> 03:53:09.020
[Amit Varma]: of that dharam sansad where you had a bunch of leaders. And to me, that was competitive,

03:53:09.020 --> 03:53:13.900
[Amit Varma]: that was that was bound, they were all bound to be so extreme, because they were competing with

03:53:13.900 --> 03:53:18.700
[Amit Varma]: each other. Had it been one guy on a stage, he might have said something a little less mad,

03:53:18.700 --> 03:53:23.340
[Amit Varma]: you know, still would have been objectionable, but a little less mad, but they competed with

03:53:23.340 --> 03:53:27.180
[Amit Varma]: each other. And the worry is that that kind of continues. And by the way, among the Republicans,

03:53:27.180 --> 03:53:31.340
[Amit Varma]: Justin Amash did leave, but yeah, outlier who proves you know, the exception that proves the

03:53:31.340 --> 03:53:37.260
[Amit Varma]: rule, I guess, in a sense, you know, I think I've held you long enough. So we can, you know,

03:53:37.260 --> 03:53:43.020
[Amit Varma]: move away to more general questions, and then something more pleasant. And my big general

03:53:43.020 --> 03:53:50.620
[Amit Varma]: question here is multifold, which is about engaging with reality, something that you've

03:53:50.620 --> 03:53:55.180
[Amit Varma]: kind of referred to how in politics, the rules of the game have also sort of changed. And I look at

03:53:56.220 --> 03:54:04.140
[Amit Varma]: different sort of ecosystems, and how they engage with reality. And one, I see the academic

03:54:04.140 --> 03:54:11.180
[Amit Varma]: ecosystem, where I find that there is this massive academic circle jerk, where academics are talking

03:54:11.180 --> 03:54:15.980
[Amit Varma]: to each other, and they are kind of trapped in that loop. And there are certain fashionable

03:54:15.980 --> 03:54:19.740
[Amit Varma]: prisms which have to be adopted. Otherwise, you're not getting your papers published or not

03:54:19.740 --> 03:54:25.100
[Amit Varma]: getting tenure. And more and more, I see the academic world, especially in the humanities,

03:54:25.100 --> 03:54:29.500
[Amit Varma]: as something that is in a parallel universe and has lost all connection to the real world. And

03:54:29.500 --> 03:54:35.260
[Amit Varma]: nobody takes him seriously and rightly so. I mean, individuals, of course, produce important work,

03:54:35.260 --> 03:54:40.940
[Amit Varma]: but otherwise, then I look at politics, and politics also in India, politicians don't bother

03:54:40.940 --> 03:54:46.380
[Amit Varma]: to engage with reality in that sense, because, you know, our politicians have figured out that

03:54:46.380 --> 03:54:51.500
[Amit Varma]: narratives matter, governance doesn't. And in any case, their core skill when they get to power is

03:54:51.500 --> 03:54:56.460
[Amit Varma]: building narratives, that's how they get to power. Governance is not necessarily a core skill, you

03:54:56.460 --> 03:55:01.420
[Amit Varma]: can, you know, when you take over the state, you can let inertia continue, and so on and so forth.

03:55:01.420 --> 03:55:08.700
[Amit Varma]: And there also engagement with reality is not so critical. You know, as far as the media is

03:55:08.700 --> 03:55:13.180
[Amit Varma]: concerned, mainstream media is pretty much irrelevant, that we no longer have a consensus

03:55:13.180 --> 03:55:18.380
[Amit Varma]: on the truth. It's narrative battles everywhere. As far as individuals are concerned, I think,

03:55:18.380 --> 03:55:21.980
[Amit Varma]: you know, there is that famous quote from Kashi Kasi, where Kashi Nath Singh says,

03:55:21.980 --> 03:55:27.180
[Amit Varma]: ki bhar mein jaye duniya, hum bhajaye harmoniya, right, which is, sometimes I feel that I should

03:55:27.180 --> 03:55:33.420
[Amit Varma]: just adopt that and live by that. And I think many people, whatever they do, they, you know,

03:55:33.420 --> 03:55:37.660
[Amit Varma]: they do despite the state, they're like, I got to get by how I got to get by, I don't really care.

03:55:37.660 --> 03:55:42.860
[Amit Varma]: And plus, you know, rational ignorance kicks in, why waste time, when your one vote won't make so

03:55:42.860 --> 03:55:48.380
[Amit Varma]: much of a difference. And the market engages with reality to the limited extent that, you know,

03:55:48.380 --> 03:55:52.460
[Amit Varma]: you make money by fulfilling people's desires. So you want to know what they are, and so on and so

03:55:52.460 --> 03:55:58.700
[Amit Varma]: forth. This then just becomes an issue that, you know, reality is not in question. And all of this,

03:55:58.700 --> 03:56:05.740
[Amit Varma]: it's it's narrative games, narrative battles. You know, many great intellectuals are wasted

03:56:05.740 --> 03:56:09.900
[Amit Varma]: in different ecosystems where they are of no consequence, like the academic

03:56:10.860 --> 03:56:16.220
[Amit Varma]: world, for example. So what is your sense of all of this? Or am I being too pessimistic,

03:56:16.220 --> 03:56:22.860
[Guest]: as is mostly the case? I mean, these days you want to say, you know,

03:56:22.860 --> 03:56:28.220
[Guest]: there's no such thing as being too pessimistic on this road. But I think I broadly agree with you.

03:56:28.220 --> 03:56:35.420
[Guest]: See, I think I have a slightly different take on the academic story. I actually don't think

03:56:35.420 --> 03:56:40.940
[Guest]: academics are meant to be consequential. And I think if academics play for consequence,

03:56:40.940 --> 03:56:46.380
[Guest]: they actually betray their profession. Because we are precisely supposed to be the conditionality of

03:56:46.380 --> 03:56:52.940
[Guest]: reflective stuff. And my worry about a lot of academics is not that they're not influential,

03:56:53.820 --> 03:57:00.620
[Guest]: or they're irrelevant, is that in the way in which that we have now set our protocols,

03:57:00.620 --> 03:57:06.540
[Guest]: even inside the academy, we are actually betraying our vocation. So I actually,

03:57:06.540 --> 03:57:12.300
[Guest]: I mean, it is meant to be an ivory tower, precisely for a reason. No, I agree with you

03:57:12.300 --> 03:57:15.740
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that I agree that academics aren't meant to pursue change, but they are meant to

03:57:15.740 --> 03:57:22.460
[Guest]: pursue truth. And more importantly, right, they are being letting themselves being used as a kind

03:57:22.460 --> 03:57:32.860
[Guest]: of lighting rod. I mean, that's the worst part, right? Now, but here, I think I would distinguish

03:57:32.860 --> 03:57:39.740
[Guest]: between two kinds of politicisation. So look, one, like with any organisation, there's a kind

03:57:39.740 --> 03:57:43.180
[Guest]: of institutional pathology, and particularly a lot of the stuff that you talked about,

03:57:43.980 --> 03:57:51.180
[Guest]: you know, building empires, patronage, creating particular paradigms. You know, these are

03:57:51.180 --> 03:57:55.420
[Guest]: actually all straightforward power grabs within the academia. They start off with good intention,

03:57:55.420 --> 03:58:05.020
[Guest]: but every paradigm wants to perpetuate itself, right? The second thing, I think, is,

03:58:06.380 --> 03:58:13.260
[Guest]: I think this argument about the political views of academics. And there, I actually think the

03:58:13.260 --> 03:58:18.620
[Guest]: story is a little bit more exaggerated, because you will, of course, expect academics to be at,

03:58:18.620 --> 03:58:23.820
[Guest]: in a sense, the frontier of, you know, and if you look at the kinds of things that people are

03:58:23.820 --> 03:58:30.540
[Guest]: objecting to, that academics are doing, particularly in the US, I think the bad faith of the objectors

03:58:30.540 --> 03:58:36.540
[Guest]: is as much clear as anything else. I mean, you know, I have my problems with critical race theory,

03:58:36.540 --> 03:58:41.820
[Guest]: but like anything, it had a kind of core insight, which you know, now you want to say, you know,

03:58:41.820 --> 03:58:49.660
[Guest]: you just can't even in some sense, right? There's a particular crisis specific to the humanities

03:58:49.660 --> 03:58:59.500
[Guest]: and disciplines like history. And I don't think that crisis is solvable. We used to manage the

03:58:59.500 --> 03:59:05.020
[Guest]: crisis by basically saying the political stakes in this should not be high. So let the 16, 19,

03:59:05.020 --> 03:59:12.220
[Guest]: 1776 project duke it out. Let Romila Thapar and Sitaram Goyal duke it out on medieval history,

03:59:12.220 --> 03:59:21.020
[Guest]: you know, we'll see that R.C. Majumdar, right? The problem, in a sense, is the insertion of a

03:59:21.020 --> 03:59:28.940
[Guest]: national identity in discourse that actually says our ground is that history. Now, once that happens,

03:59:28.940 --> 03:59:33.340
[Guest]: it both distorts the history and in a sense, the stakes, because you know, and I think to that

03:59:33.340 --> 03:59:38.380
[Guest]: extent, that has kind of changed. I mean, I think, I, you know, I'm feeling kind of nostalgic,

03:59:38.380 --> 03:59:43.180
[Guest]: JNU has a lot to answer for. I mean, JNU's, you know, academic practices were in some senses

03:59:43.180 --> 03:59:50.460
[Guest]: deeply exclusionary. But you know, in the 70s, right, the big exclusions were, you know,

03:59:50.460 --> 03:59:56.620
[Guest]: or 80s subaltern studies, and CPI historians are not genuine historians, it was not the right wing.

03:59:56.620 --> 04:00:01.900
[Guest]: I mean, it actually, you know, it's, you know, so I'd have colleagues would say Shahid Amin is

04:00:01.900 --> 04:00:05.580
[Guest]: not a real historian, you know, you're like scratching your head. I mean, you know, it's a

04:00:05.580 --> 04:00:11.740
[Guest]: so there was a certain kind of, I think, I think, pettiness and academic, I think,

04:00:11.740 --> 04:00:17.740
[Guest]: patronage story there. But I don't think the crisis of the history profession

04:00:19.100 --> 04:00:24.540
[Guest]: is going to be solved so long as you have a politics governed by nationalism.

04:00:25.420 --> 04:00:29.820
[Guest]: And unfortunately, I think history is also set it as a self of the problem, because most modern

04:00:29.820 --> 04:00:36.940
[Guest]: historiography was done in the service of the nation state in, you know, in, you know, in some

04:00:36.940 --> 04:00:44.460
[Guest]: ways. And so until we reach a point where the social contact is look, it doesn't matter, right,

04:00:44.460 --> 04:00:50.700
[Guest]: whether Babur demolished a mosque or not, at least not to the project that we want to salvage now,

04:00:51.260 --> 04:00:55.180
[Guest]: I don't think you're going to get through the crisis of history. And unfortunately, historians,

04:00:55.180 --> 04:01:00.140
[Guest]: because in a way, it increases their importance fall right into the trap. I mean, you know,

04:01:00.140 --> 04:01:05.180
[Guest]: they want to actually argue on those grounds. You just, you know, I mean, who knows if tomorrow,

04:01:05.180 --> 04:01:09.820
[Guest]: a new document is discovered, do we completely change the modern Indian project and it justifies,

04:01:11.100 --> 04:01:15.500
[Guest]: you know, so I think the crisis of history because of its close connection to the nation state,

04:01:16.300 --> 04:01:20.460
[Guest]: I think is a particular one. I think the crisis of disciplines like economics and stuff is, I think,

04:01:20.460 --> 04:01:26.620
[Guest]: much more methodological hubris in some ways, I think, again, forgetting the conditionality of

04:01:26.620 --> 04:01:34.540
[Guest]: your own, you know, own thinking. Politicians, I disagree with you a little bit. Even now,

04:01:36.540 --> 04:01:42.220
[Guest]: there's a fair degree of engagement with reality. I mean, the narrative part comes in, because

04:01:42.220 --> 04:01:45.580
[Guest]: that's a way of kind of coping with what this is. So when you can't build a coalition next,

04:01:45.580 --> 04:01:52.220
[Guest]: you build it on why, right? But there is still something about the culture of politics that

04:01:52.220 --> 04:01:59.500
[Guest]: actually forces. And even with the BJP government, I mean, you know, for the remarkable thing is,

04:02:00.460 --> 04:02:06.380
[Guest]: how it feels it needs to respond. You know, RSS farmers are upset, you know,

04:02:06.380 --> 04:02:12.060
[Guest]: it could be for purely tactical reasons, right? The sootboot ki sarkar jayi,

04:02:12.060 --> 04:02:15.820
[Guest]: I mean, a larger scheme of things seem like a little political triviality,

04:02:16.460 --> 04:02:23.180
[Guest]: but what it meant, in a sense, some senses to project. So I think with them, the issue is not

04:02:24.380 --> 04:02:29.500
[Guest]: that they're in touch with reality, it's whether they have the imagination and are willing to

04:02:29.500 --> 04:02:34.540
[Guest]: expend whatever political capital they have to actually, as you said, create those structures

04:02:34.540 --> 04:02:39.420
[Guest]: of governance, and in some areas they will and some areas they won't. I mean, I think the one

04:02:39.420 --> 04:02:43.500
[Guest]: I think thing we are interestingly missing, I think, about the Indian state, and I have a

04:02:43.500 --> 04:02:49.420
[Guest]: slight disagreement with my friend Karthik on this, where, you know, we've got used to this

04:02:49.420 --> 04:02:54.700
[Guest]: very simple narrative of the public as a failure, and the private as a kind of redemption.

04:02:56.140 --> 04:03:03.100
[Guest]: You know, for a lot of people, beginning with UPA1 is for the first time they're actually

04:03:03.100 --> 04:03:07.420
[Guest]: experiencing state capacity. I mean, think of infrastructure, for example, I mean,

04:03:07.420 --> 04:03:12.220
[Guest]: you know, we are a completely different page, right? Now, the surveillance things and stuff

04:03:12.220 --> 04:03:18.460
[Guest]: worries me, but the digital stuff is an expression of state capacity in some ways, right? And

04:03:20.300 --> 04:03:26.540
[Guest]: what we have been, in a sense, being able to do on scale, in lots of different ways, is

04:03:27.740 --> 04:03:32.380
[Guest]: that so I think it's a little bit unfair to say that what politicians are not doing our governance.

04:03:32.380 --> 04:03:38.860
[Guest]: So, in my senses, they're finite. I think every government in India now, every state government

04:03:39.500 --> 04:03:45.820
[Guest]: does two things well, because that's the ambit of its capability. That's right, it decides what to

04:03:45.820 --> 04:03:52.540
[Guest]: do. Arvind Kejriwal decided health and education. Many would argue about infrastructure in Delhi,

04:03:52.540 --> 04:03:59.580
[Guest]: right, whether the roads and stuff are. So, I actually think the politicians are actually quite

04:03:59.580 --> 04:04:04.300
[Guest]: capable of building out state capacity. I think what we did with, I think what we're doing with

04:04:04.300 --> 04:04:08.700
[Guest]: food distribution, right? I mean, for all the limitations, and there are exclusions,

04:04:09.900 --> 04:04:14.940
[Guest]: the debate on where PDS and the distribution of food now is very, very different from 20 years

04:04:14.940 --> 04:04:19.900
[Guest]: ago. Cash transfers, now you can agree or disagree with cash transfers, whether they're

04:04:19.900 --> 04:04:24.780
[Guest]: freebies or productives or not. But the fact that you can actually pull off what you're pulling off

04:04:24.780 --> 04:04:32.060
[Guest]: on scale. So, I think the politicians are actually interested in reality. I think

04:04:32.620 --> 04:04:38.460
[Guest]: their just conception of it, I think, differs a little bit slightly from ours. And I think the

04:04:38.460 --> 04:04:45.660
[Guest]: care, I think, which we have to take, you know, is that at the end of the day,

04:04:45.660 --> 04:04:49.340
[Guest]: but the public wants results, I think it's less interested in the public private thing.

04:04:49.340 --> 04:04:55.420
[Guest]: And most of the politicians, I think, of this generation have grasped the importance of state

04:04:55.420 --> 04:05:01.820
[Guest]: capacity. Now, they'll use it for nefarious ends. There are political constraints. I mean,

04:05:01.820 --> 04:05:05.500
[Guest]: if you want to centralise power, sometimes that can detract from a certain kind of state capacity.

04:05:06.460 --> 04:05:13.420
[Guest]: But, you know, I think we underestimate how much expansion of state capacity is actually

04:05:13.420 --> 04:05:21.340
[Guest]: happening in India, in some ways. I don't think that narrative, I mean, even of teacher absenteeism,

04:05:21.340 --> 04:05:25.740
[Guest]: actually, the government school thing has had ripple effects everywhere. I mean, look at the

04:05:25.740 --> 04:05:32.380
[Guest]: transfer system in Haryana now, right? This kind of semi automated system, which Arvind Kejriwal

04:05:32.380 --> 04:05:37.100
[Guest]: now wants to take to Gujarat, you know, everybody give your first preferences, they'll have an

04:05:37.100 --> 04:05:44.140
[Guest]: algorithm sorting out. Actually, it was quite a big deal. I mean, the hundreds of people used

04:05:44.140 --> 04:05:49.020
[Guest]: to line outside Chandigarh for transfers. I'm sure that the margin sum of that stuff is still

04:05:49.020 --> 04:05:55.500
[Guest]: happening. So I actually do think in that sense, politicians and what actually makes them dangerous

04:05:55.500 --> 04:06:00.940
[Guest]: is precisely that. I mean, if it were pure narrative, I think we just explored beyond the

04:06:00.940 --> 04:06:07.180
[Guest]: point. I mean, you know, you cannot fool all the people all the time, right? Is that I think they

04:06:07.180 --> 04:06:11.900
[Guest]: are actually much more attuned to this stuff than I think a lot of us academics are actually,

04:06:12.860 --> 04:06:22.220
[Guest]: in some ways. And they've figured out a social contract within their political imagination.

04:06:23.260 --> 04:06:27.740
[Guest]: Everybody's asking the question, you know, why isn't inflation generating more political

04:06:27.740 --> 04:06:33.900
[Guest]: resistance? Actually, maybe it's because compared to the 70s, because that's our benchmark, right?

04:06:33.900 --> 04:06:41.420
[Guest]: 80s and 70s. Maybe for certain sections, there's actually less volatility in basic access to food

04:06:41.420 --> 04:06:46.300
[Guest]: than was the case in the 70s and 80s. So yes, inflation is an issue, milk and vegetables and

04:06:46.300 --> 04:06:52.620
[Guest]: petrol prices are an issue. But it's not an issue in the same way that let's say flour and wheat

04:06:52.620 --> 04:06:59.580
[Guest]: might have been, you know, 25-30 years ago. So one of the reasons we always lose against

04:06:59.580 --> 04:07:05.340
[Guest]: politicians is they are actually more circumscribed by reality than we are.

04:07:08.460 --> 04:07:13.660
[Guest]: Yes, the media, the public sphere, absolutely. I mean, and it actually goes back to the

04:07:13.660 --> 04:07:21.340
[Guest]: fundamental problem, right, which is both the commercial incentives, if you are really in the

04:07:21.340 --> 04:07:26.380
[Guest]: world as you know, this example you gave that a certain kind of post will go viral and get you

04:07:26.380 --> 04:07:33.180
[Guest]: more revenue. And you are in a regulatory world where pretty much most of the media is now supply

04:07:33.180 --> 04:07:38.220
[Guest]: side media. I mean, I don't think Mr. Narani is going to make money off NDTV. That's not the point.

04:07:38.220 --> 04:07:43.900
[Guest]: Most channels don't make money, right? You actually have an architectural problem, which is,

04:07:44.940 --> 04:07:49.820
[Guest]: you know, what are the avenues through which voices get amplified? Now, having said that,

04:07:49.820 --> 04:07:53.260
[Guest]: I actually think in certain sections of the media, I think the Hindi press,

04:07:53.260 --> 04:07:57.580
[Guest]: certain parts of the Hindi press, which I read, I actually don't think it's a structural problem.

04:07:57.580 --> 04:08:01.980
[Guest]: These are genuine media houses, but they have become genuinely committed to this political

04:08:01.980 --> 04:08:09.580
[Guest]: project. I think they'll think of the Dharani Jagran, for example. You know that and it's a

04:08:09.580 --> 04:08:14.460
[Guest]: kind of indication of that institutionalization of, I don't think it's just because there's

04:08:14.460 --> 04:08:20.780
[Guest]: pressure. They are actually real believers in this stuff. Yeah, I mean, there are plenty of real

04:08:20.780 --> 04:08:25.740
[Amit Varma]: believers. I mean, this is a society. Let's honestly, it's quite a hopeful note that you've

04:08:25.740 --> 04:08:33.100
[Amit Varma]: struck that our politicians perhaps can eventually someday come to the rescue. Let's now talk about

04:08:33.100 --> 04:08:37.740
[Amit Varma]: your reading habit, which I'm interested in. You said that the ideal kind of life for you

04:08:37.740 --> 04:08:43.260
[Amit Varma]: is and your thick desire is that you're paid to read books. So tell me a little bit about

04:08:43.260 --> 04:08:48.540
[Amit Varma]: what your reading habit is like. Is there an intentionality to your reading habit as well,

04:08:48.540 --> 04:08:53.100
[Amit Varma]: that at some point you decided that there is a certain amount of reading you do? Also, when you

04:08:53.100 --> 04:08:58.620
[Amit Varma]: read, you know, do you take notes? What do you do for, you know, assimilating the knowledge that

04:08:58.620 --> 04:09:05.100
[Amit Varma]: you gather for knowledge management? And how big is writing a part of that assimilation process?

04:09:05.100 --> 04:09:13.820
[Guest]: Oh, wow. You know, one should not overvalorize reading. I mean, it's something I enjoy. You

04:09:13.820 --> 04:09:19.980
[Guest]: know, there's that famous line of Hobbes, I don't know whether you've heard. So John Aubrey, who's

04:09:19.980 --> 04:09:25.660
[Guest]: this 17th century gossip, you know, and writes these wonderful brief lives of all the kind of

04:09:25.660 --> 04:09:32.700
[Guest]: big characters of 17th century. So he goes to Hobbes and says, you know, Mr. Hobbes,

04:09:32.700 --> 04:09:37.900
[Guest]: people don't think you're a real scholar. I mean, obviously, Hobbes's political views

04:09:37.900 --> 04:09:44.620
[Guest]: are controversial. Because you don't cite many people in your books, which gives them the

04:09:44.620 --> 04:09:49.100
[Guest]: impression that you actually haven't read a whole lot. And Hobbes replies, he said,

04:09:49.100 --> 04:09:53.740
[Guest]: if I had read as much as anyone else, I would have known only as much as anyone else.

04:09:53.740 --> 04:10:03.420
[Guest]: So I think you can, you know, I mean, I think you can valorize. But I'm addicted to reading

04:10:03.420 --> 04:10:09.820
[Guest]: in the sense that without a certain number of hours of it a day, it can vary. I mean,

04:10:09.820 --> 04:10:15.740
[Guest]: that obviously varies by responsibility and where you are. This is just almost the sense of, you

04:10:15.740 --> 04:10:23.340
[Guest]: know, when it's almost like an addiction in some ways. It's much less disciplined, I think. And

04:10:23.340 --> 04:10:31.980
[Guest]: particularly now, where I think the temptation to gain lots of superficial knowledge in lots of

04:10:31.980 --> 04:10:35.180
[Guest]: different fields, at least, even if you don't understand, you can say, okay, yes, this is the

04:10:35.180 --> 04:10:42.860
[Guest]: question that we're asking, I think is, is, is much, much greater. The notes and stuff is so,

04:10:42.860 --> 04:10:48.780
[Guest]: so anything that's in my core discipline, particularly political theory and philosophy,

04:10:48.780 --> 04:10:55.740
[Guest]: of course, is not just detailed notes, but in some senses, the act of responding by writing,

04:10:55.740 --> 04:10:59.660
[Guest]: not necessarily publishing, but at least you're kind of engaging with it, I think is,

04:11:00.460 --> 04:11:07.580
[Guest]: is hugely important. And I actually find teaching does the wonders for your reading, you actually

04:11:08.540 --> 04:11:13.500
[Guest]: read things differently when you have to teach it. Because you then have to really, in a sense,

04:11:13.500 --> 04:11:19.980
[Guest]: clarify the logical presentation in a way in which, you know, sometimes reading you can skip

04:11:19.980 --> 04:11:25.820
[Guest]: on. I used to do a lot of marginal notes, which partly because a larger proportion of the books

04:11:25.820 --> 04:11:31.020
[Guest]: are now in electronic format, I mean, just for access reasons. I mean, you can highlight and

04:11:31.020 --> 04:11:39.900
[Guest]: stuff, but I actually miss the dogmark books with all kinds of annotations. I think, you know,

04:11:39.900 --> 04:11:48.140
[Guest]: you know, I think across, across the board. I do find, as you get older, talking of the dissolving

04:11:48.140 --> 04:11:56.060
[Guest]: self, that the ability to retain structures and arguments, I think, still remains, but

04:11:57.980 --> 04:12:04.940
[Guest]: the memory about, like, detail and facts, I think I used to be better at it, right? I mean,

04:12:04.940 --> 04:12:11.820
[Guest]: and this is a gift often historians have, right? I think you find yourself struggling

04:12:11.820 --> 04:12:15.660
[Guest]: with a little bit more with that now. And maybe it's just a kind of, you know, process of

04:12:17.180 --> 04:12:22.620
[Guest]: aging, or at least I hope it's nothing more than that. And, you know, and, and, and it's

04:12:22.620 --> 04:12:28.540
[Guest]: interesting how the memory works in some ways that it's, if you can figure out the architectonic,

04:12:28.540 --> 04:12:35.100
[Guest]: it's easier to retain than, in a sense, trying to, you know, retain lots of details and narratives

04:12:35.100 --> 04:12:40.620
[Guest]: and facts. So I've, I've become less in command of stories, I think, then, then, then I kind of

04:12:40.620 --> 04:12:45.180
[Guest]: used to, even in the reading of fiction, I mean, you know, the broad outlines of the point,

04:12:45.820 --> 04:12:51.980
[Guest]: the plot, the affect, if it made you think, all that remains, but the kinds of things that you

04:12:51.980 --> 04:12:56.540
[Guest]: used to remember, which is, you know, lines from characters, textures of characters that I think,

04:12:56.540 --> 04:12:59.420
[Guest]: and maybe it's just, oh, Lord, I mean, it could be just just be that, you know,

04:12:59.420 --> 04:13:02.940
[Guest]: there's too much time on the screen. And so you're not processing it as as much.

04:13:03.740 --> 04:13:08.620
[Amit Varma]: So final question for my listeners, and for me, you know, recommend some books,

04:13:08.620 --> 04:13:13.980
[Amit Varma]: movies, or music or any kind of art that's that you love and that you want to share with the world.

04:13:15.580 --> 04:13:22.940
[Guest]: Oh, gosh. So much. Academics are the wrong people to I think,

04:13:22.940 --> 04:13:28.060
[Guest]: what kind of music do you listen to? So with music, it's mostly Hindustani

04:13:28.060 --> 04:13:35.660
[Guest]: classical, I mean, that's about 75 to 80%. And otherwise, it's in these, I actually,

04:13:36.860 --> 04:13:44.540
[Guest]: Western music, it'll be Western classical mostly, orchestral stuff. So it's, it's, I mean,

04:13:44.540 --> 04:13:53.020
[Guest]: it's not, it's not a very surprising to the usual suspects, Beethoven, Mozart, Handel, Mendelssohn.

04:13:53.660 --> 04:13:57.260
[Guest]: And actually, the one thing I would recommend, actually, for particularly people who are not

04:13:57.260 --> 04:14:03.580
[Guest]: used to East and Western classical, the Berlin Philharmonic, they started this under COVID,

04:14:03.580 --> 04:14:08.300
[Guest]: but they've actually put out a lot of this stuff online. And they also do like,

04:14:08.940 --> 04:14:12.380
[Guest]: these 10 minute things, right? So it's a larger performance. And obviously, you have to

04:14:12.380 --> 04:14:18.860
[Guest]: subscribe to pay access to the larger performance just digitally. But even the shorter things

04:14:18.860 --> 04:14:25.020
[Guest]: are truly kind of extraordinary, if you're kind of, you know, feeling so that that that's actually

04:14:25.020 --> 04:14:30.220
[Guest]: become the kind of, you know, you just look at the kind of Berlin Philharmonic's next release.

04:14:30.780 --> 04:14:37.100
[Guest]: But otherwise, and I think with classical now, interestingly, after going through a phase where

04:14:37.100 --> 04:14:43.340
[Guest]: I thought I had less patience, actually going back to longer compositions. Because one of the,

04:14:43.340 --> 04:14:47.580
[Guest]: I think, interesting things about, you know, Indian classical and talk of empowerment is

04:14:48.140 --> 04:14:53.980
[Guest]: the archive that is now publicly available. I mean, you know, we all grew up with Nikhil

04:14:53.980 --> 04:14:58.220
[Guest]: Banerjee, but the repertoire we'd heard was probably like 20 recordings. Now it's probably

04:14:58.220 --> 04:15:03.420
[Guest]: like 80, 100. And some of them are better than anything that was kind of published in his

04:15:03.420 --> 04:15:09.500
[Guest]: published in his lifetime, right? So there's a way in which you you actually kind of recreate

04:15:09.500 --> 04:15:15.100
[Guest]: your own sense of the history of that music and that performer. I think that's actually right now,

04:15:15.100 --> 04:15:20.220
[Guest]: I think I think that's been more enticing in some ways, I think, than anything.

04:15:21.660 --> 04:15:23.340
[Amit Varma]: Books, films,

04:15:23.340 --> 04:15:30.940
[Guest]: God books. I think on fiction. I think the Hilary Mantel trilogy, I think is stunning,

04:15:30.940 --> 04:15:35.180
[Guest]: particularly the third one, actually, people like the third less, but I thought it's a real

04:15:35.180 --> 04:15:40.700
[Guest]: two, particularly, particularly if you're interested in politics. I mean, it's of a

04:15:40.700 --> 04:15:50.540
[Guest]: kind of different order. I've been trying to read a lot more Hindi fiction. And I must confess,

04:15:50.540 --> 04:15:56.700
[Guest]: I think people like Premchand, I had read at an age where you kind of miss most of it. I mean,

04:15:56.700 --> 04:16:02.540
[Guest]: you know, you you read, there is such a thing as kind of rereading with a different, I think, lens.

04:16:05.580 --> 04:16:08.540
[Guest]: There's an academic in Delhi University, a poor one, and the professor of

04:16:09.100 --> 04:16:16.140
[Guest]: Hindi is a wonderful book on Premchand, actually, which, you know, apart from everything else,

04:16:16.140 --> 04:16:21.100
[Guest]: is a kind of model of how to read sensitively, you know, and you just makes you look at the

04:16:21.100 --> 04:16:25.260
[Guest]: stories very, very differently. And it's actually a meditation secularism, because that's a lot of

04:16:25.260 --> 04:16:34.140
[Guest]: what the Premchand, I think, you know, story is, you know, stories about, I think a lot of,

04:16:34.140 --> 04:16:40.540
[Guest]: you know, given the theme that we discussed, and this is a course I've been teaching and

04:16:40.540 --> 04:16:46.700
[Guest]: hope to develop for that is this course on global political thought. And I have to say my

04:16:48.140 --> 04:16:54.380
[Guest]: acquaintance with both Chinese political thought and broadly what's called Islamic political thought

04:16:54.380 --> 04:17:01.580
[Guest]: was relatively cursory. I mean, in a new fair bit, some of the classics, but to actually kind

04:17:01.580 --> 04:17:07.740
[Guest]: of engage, I think, as seriously with it. So the last year, I think a lot of it has, you know,

04:17:07.740 --> 04:17:12.940
[Guest]: been kind of again, and this is that, that gives you a kind of very different perspective in some

04:17:12.940 --> 04:17:19.660
[Guest]: senses on how people situated in these societies looking at normative questions and history.

04:17:19.660 --> 04:17:25.420
[Guest]: And the quality of writing and scholarship is just stunning. I mean, I think. So I think we

04:17:25.420 --> 04:17:31.420
[Guest]: are at the age where, you know, a lot of lateral reading, in some senses, I think, and drawing

04:17:31.420 --> 04:17:37.100
[Guest]: lateral connections is probably much more interesting than kind of just digging down

04:17:37.100 --> 04:17:37.900
[Guest]: in your own furrow.

04:17:39.180 --> 04:17:42.380
