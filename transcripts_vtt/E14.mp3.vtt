00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.880
[Amit Varma]: I had a bad dream the other night. I dreamed that I was sitting on an old wooden armchair

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.400
[Amit Varma]: in an apartment that I lived in on Marine Drive. It was a massive apartment. My room

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.800
[Amit Varma]: was as big as a tennis court. And this flat seemed endless with bedrooms and dressing

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.280
[Amit Varma]: rooms and halls and hallways and bathrooms and closets and kitchens and entertainment

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.240
[Amit Varma]: rooms, sports rooms, a couple of bars, perhaps even a torture chamber. This was an apartment

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.440
[Amit Varma]: you would have to measure not in hundreds of square feet, but in thousands of square

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.200
[Amit Varma]: feet, perhaps even in acres. And as I sat on my old wooden armchair, the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.600
[Amit Varma]: same armchair on which Jawaharlal Nehru had once panked Indira, I heard a loud noise.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.880
[Amit Varma]: It was the kind of sound a house would make if a house could fart.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.640
[Amit Varma]: I looked to my right and there was a huge crack on the wall. I heard the sound again

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.400
[Amit Varma]: and some cement dust fell on me. The ceiling was cracking now. I looked out through the

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.520
[Amit Varma]: window on my right and the building there collapsed. All around me, the cracks in the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.800
[Amit Varma]: walls just grew. I looked through the inside door of the house and I found that half of

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.440
[Amit Varma]: bedroom 44 had collapsed. My old poster bed, on which Motilal Nehru's mother had given

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.880
[Amit Varma]: birth to Motilal, was half in the room and half suspended in space. Clearly the house

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.760
[Amit Varma]: was collapsing. One of the cracks in the wall nearest to me

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.080
[Amit Varma]: widened and became a hole. A sparrow thrust its head through that hole. It made chirrupy

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.520
[Amit Varma]: noises at me. And then it said in a human voice, Aren't you gonna leave the house? Aren't

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.320
[Amit Varma]: you gonna leave the house? It's falling down. And I just turned to that stupid sparrow and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.840
[Amit Varma]: I said, How can I leave? This is a rent-controlled flat. I pay only twenty rupees a month to

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.640
[Amit Varma]: live here. I can never leave this flat. And the sparrow said, Damn this rent control!

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:22.280
[Unknown]: Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.960
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.560
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen. My guest today is the American economist Alex Tabarrok,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.600
[Amit Varma]: who's here in Mumbai as a resident senior fellow at the IDFC Institute. He was a guest

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.680
[Amit Varma]: on the Scene and the Unseen a few weeks ago, where he spoke to me about FSI. Today, he

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.360
[Amit Varma]: joins me to talk about rent control. Welcome to the show, Alex.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.480
[Amit Varma]: Great to be here. So you've by now spent like three months

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.240
[Amit Varma]: in Mumbai. This is also known as the city of rent control.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.720
[Guest]: Yeah, that makes it fascinating for an economist to visit and see.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.100
[Amit Varma]: So tell me the history of rent control in the USA. How did it pan out over there?

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.760
[Guest]: So rent control has been particularly big in the United States, in New York. And they

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.320
[Guest]: put into place rent control during World War II. And the thing about rent control is that

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.360
[Guest]: it's great when you first start it, because you can't run away with an apartment building.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.440
[Guest]: So the owners of the apartment building, it's already built. The government says, Oh, you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.040
[Guest]: can't charge, you know, a high rent. What can they do? Nothing. That's the short run,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.280
[Guest]: or in the long run, when you have rent control, there's no incentive for developers to build

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.600
[Guest]: apartments. There's also no incentive for developers to maintain apartments. So what

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.360
[Guest]: happened in New York is that over time, huge areas of New York actually really started

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.280
[Guest]: to crumble away, almost as if they had been bombed. This was the time where you had movies

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.680
[Guest]: like Escape from New York, or Fort Apache, the Bronx, where New York literally looked

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.400
[Guest]: like a hellhole that you wanted to escape from. And really, the reason was, is that

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.960
[Guest]: rent controls created kind of a devastating situation in which entire blocks started to

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.600
[Guest]: crumble away. Now, what happened in New York is that over time, the rent controls were

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.480
[Guest]: loosened considerably, so that new buildings did not have any rent controls, so that when

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.540
[Guest]: somebody left their apartment building, you could raise the rent and things like that.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.080
[Guest]: So although New York still has some rent controls, particularly on the old stock, what has happened

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.600
[Guest]: in the United States and in New York, in particular, is that rent controls have faded away over

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.000
[Guest]: time. And that has provided new incentives to build apartments.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.400
[Amit Varma]: So the intentions behind rent control, obviously, they sound great, that, you know, poor people

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.160
[Amit Varma]: can't afford rising rents, and therefore you keep rents stable for them and all of that.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.920
[Amit Varma]: What else? I mean, the unseen effects, like you mentioned, is that then the owners have

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.240
[Amit Varma]: no incentives to look after the property, to develop the property further. Isn't this

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.000
[Amit Varma]: in a sense a form of theft? You're destroying a lot of capital suddenly. It's almost like

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.440
[Amit Varma]: dead capital, not literally that, but...

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.800
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly. And the situation in Mumbai has been even worse than in New York, because

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.440
[Guest]: Mumbai put price controls, rent controls in, in something like 1949, and they have never

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.840
[Guest]: raised them. They're still the same level, despite inflation, despite changes in economic

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.720
[Guest]: circumstances, the rent controls haven't changed. So what this means is that if you're in a

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.200
[Guest]: rent controlled apartment in Mumbai, you never want to give your apartment up. I mean, even

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.520
[Guest]: if the apartment is falling apart, it doesn't matter because the rents are so ridiculously

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.320
[Guest]: low that you don't want to give your apartment up ever. And this means that it's really difficult

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.040
[Guest]: to build new apartments, to take a crumbling apartment and build something taller and bigger

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.240
[Guest]: and better, with more apartments and, you know, better infrastructure, it's really hard

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.240
[Amit Varma]: to do.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.440
[Amit Varma]: You'll see this if you're driving down Marine Drive, for example, the Queen's Necklace,

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.720
[Amit Varma]: and you have all these old buildings lining it up, which, you know, haven't been renovated

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.320
[Amit Varma]: for decades, almost. And I know people who live in some of those old buildings in these

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.280
[Amit Varma]: sprawling flats, and they're paying like 150 rupees a month for rent, which is so absurd.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.680
[Amit Varma]: And there are 10s and 1000s of, you know, apartments like that all across Mumbai, which

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.000
[Amit Varma]: are essentially, they're dead capital, they're just lying there, the owners can't do anything

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.080
[Amit Varma]: with it, the buildings can't be broken down and redeveloped and so on. Now, tell me this,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.880
[Amit Varma]: I want to understand how the political economy of this works. Who are the Baptists and the

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.880
[Amit Varma]: bootleggers in this?

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:56.280
[Guest]: Okay. Yeah, so let me just add to that, and then we'll come to the Baptists and the bootleggers.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:03.240
[Guest]: What is incredible in Mumbai is that the buildings become so dilapidated, that they literally

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.080
[Guest]: fall apart every single year, you know, as you have monsoon season come in, and then

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.680
[Guest]: these buildings are destroyed. So it literally sometimes it's killing people.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.840
[Amit Varma]: Every few months is a scandal. And it's always sort of considered like a moral failing of

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.400
[Amit Varma]: the owner for not looking after the building. When you look at the poor guy's incentives,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.680
[Amit Varma]: why on earth should he spend his hard earned money when he doesn't, in all practical terms,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.680
[Guest]: own it anymore?

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.280
[Guest]: Exactly. The owners don't own the land anymore. That's exactly correct. Now, the Baptists

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.640
[Guest]: and the bootleggers, you know, it's really hard to understand. And I think this is another

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.520
[Guest]: situation where we've just gotten into a negative equilibrium, where hardly anybody is actually

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.960
[Guest]: benefiting. Yeah, you have some Baptists. So I think we're in a situation where we've

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.400
[Guest]: gone into a negative equilibrium, where hardly anybody is benefiting from the equilibrium,

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:01.080
[Guest]: but it's still very difficult to change. So on the Baptist sort of side, the politicians

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.960
[Guest]: make it very easy to say that, well, we're for keeping rent controls. And there are people

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.280
[Guest]: who are currently in their apartments who are benefiting from that. The problem is,

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:18.080
[Guest]: is that there are many, many more people who would benefit from more construction, who

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.160
[Guest]: would benefit from better infrastructure, who would benefit from taking a two-story

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.160
[Guest]: apartment building, which has a handful of apartments, pulling it down because it's about

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.880
[Guest]: to fall down anyway, and building a 10-story or a 20-story where more people could live.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.920
[Guest]: The problem is, is that the new beneficiaries aren't voters. The new beneficiaries, they're

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.540
[Guest]: not living in Mumbai now. They'd like to live here. There's plenty of people who would like

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:52.920
[Guest]: to come in, but they're not current voters. And they, I think, often don't see these issues.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:09:02.320
[Guest]: This is an unseen issue. It seems very simple to say, if we allow the greedy developers,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.600
[Guest]: the greedy owners to raise prices, poor people are going to be kicked out of their apartment

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.560
[Guest]: buildings. And of course, there's some truth to that. The unseen part of it is that the

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:21.440
[Guest]: only way you're going to house millions of people in India is by building more. And the

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.360
[Guest]: only way you're going to build more is to create incentives to build more, for private

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.880
[Guest]: developers to build more. The only way of building more housing is to create incentives

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.120
[Guest]: for private developers to build more housing.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, here's the interesting thing. So, I look at the voters of Mumbai. Obviously, the people

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.080
[Amit Varma]: who own rent-controlled flats, whose property have been taken away from them, are very few

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.360
[Amit Varma]: in number. A slightly larger number, a much larger number, are the people who actually

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.040
[Amit Varma]: live in those rent-controlled flats and would vote in favor of rent control. But an even

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.200
[Amit Varma]: larger number, which is everybody else, is people who don't live in rent-controlled flats

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.400
[Amit Varma]: or own them, but who would benefit enormously if rent control wasn't there. But they don't

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:06.640
[Amit Varma]: understand this. So, how do you get these ideas across to people so they understand

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.200
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, rent control is bad, FSI, as we discussed in a previous episode is bad.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.900
[Amit Varma]: What's the problem with these ideas filtering through? I mean, as an economist, you often,

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, you teach economics, you speak to young students who are just coming fresh out

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.000
[Amit Varma]: of nowhere. Why are these ideas so hard to get across?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.560
[Guest]: Well, you know, Adam Smith talked about the invisible hand, the logic of the market. Well,

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.840
[Guest]: the reason it's invisible, that means it's hard to see. So, that's the problem that we

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.720
[Guest]: face as economists, to try and get people to see the invisible hand. And that's just

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:45.520
[Guest]: very, very difficult to do. You almost need sort of constitutional rules to lock some

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.760
[Guest]: of these things in place, because it's very difficult to get people to see some of these

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.320
[Guest]: things some of the time, even when it's in their interest to see these things.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.320
[Guest]: And I think something else which makes it difficult for people to see is that they do

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.880
[Guest]: see the corruption in the system. And it is a corrupt system the way it is now. There's

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:11.240
[Guest]: no question that developers will sometimes do, or owners will sometimes do disreputable

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:17.560
[Guest]: things to get people, you know, out of the apartments. Builders will pay bribes for various

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:23.600
[Guest]: things. And that turns people off. So, people see the corruption and they say, well, we

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:30.960
[Guest]: need something to stop this. We need some government to impose some moral rules against

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.960
[Guest]: these corrupt developers.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.520
[Guest]: What they don't see is that the corruption is generated by the law. The law is what is

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:44.400
[Guest]: creating the corruption. If we could get rid of some of these laws to make it easier to

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.400
[Guest]: build, easier to own property, to rent an apartment, if we could get rid of some of

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.800
[Guest]: these laws, the corruption would go away.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:59.280
[Guest]: The corruption is not a feature of capitalism. The corruption is a feature of a controlled

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:05.360
[Guest]: system in which all of the logic says, you know, we want to build because we've got so

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.360
[Guest]: many people who need apartments, so many people who need houses. There's a big demand for

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.760
[Guest]: houses and yet the supply is constrained. So, the logic is pushing people to build.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.320
[Guest]: The government says no. So, of course, you're going to have bribes. And in fact, the bribes

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.600
[Guest]: are the only thing which makes the system work at all. If it weren't for the bribes,

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.160
[Guest]: there'd be even fewer houses. There'd be even less development.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:34.640
[Guest]: So, the corruption in this case actually in the end serves some kind of good purpose.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.240
[Guest]: At least it allows some building, but it looks bad. It looks immoral. It looks distasteful

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.200
[Guest]: and people don't like to see that.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.560
[Amit Varma]: And people don't get that government is at the heart of the corruption. If not for government

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.680
[Amit Varma]: discretion and bad rules, there would be no corruption to begin with.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:55.760
[Amit Varma]: You know, living in Mumbai, I often tend to be pessimistic because in all my years of

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.840
[Amit Varma]: living in India, what you tend to see is that government just grows and grows and grows.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.400
[Amit Varma]: You can talk of reforming it, but it's just very hard to reform it in any way and to break

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.680
[Amit Varma]: down bad rules like this because you seem to be stuck in a vicious circle.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Do you, coming from where you are, have a more positive view of things? Like, for example,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.560
[Amit Varma]: will Mumbai forever be rent controlled the way it is now? Can these laws change? Can

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.880
[Guest]: incentives change?

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:29.360
[Guest]: The one thing which gives me hope is that the gains from trade here are so large that

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:35.840
[Guest]: they're pushing in favor of development and building and so forth. So, you know, clearly

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:42.580
[Guest]: India is becoming a urban society. And what that means is that hundreds of millions of

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:49.800
[Guest]: people are moving from the rural areas to the cities. So India must build new cities.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:55.960
[Guest]: That has to happen. And it's in that building of the new cities that I think there's a chance

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.500
[Guest]: to change a lot of these rules.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:04.840
[Guest]: The old cities may be stuck in this negative equilibrium, but entirely new cities are going

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:10.120
[Guest]: to have to be built, new cities with millions of people. So I think that there's a chance

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:15.800
[Guest]: here to have some demonstration projects, you know, to have in, you know, Paul Romer

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:22.040
[Guest]: talks about charter cities. But all we need, I think, is a few demonstration projects to

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:28.480
[Guest]: illustrate what could happen with better rules. And I think that would change people's point

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.920
[Guest]: of view quite a bit.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.740
[Amit Varma]: And when I look at the political economy around rent control in particular, to bring the subject

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:39.640
[Amit Varma]: back there, I often see that, sure, the interest groups in favor of rent control remaining

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.920
[Amit Varma]: are the tenants who stay in the house or a vote bank and so on. But they should logically

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.280
[Amit Varma]: also be powerful interest groups who want rent control removed. For example, builders

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.780
[Amit Varma]: who are an extremely powerful lobby in Mumbai, if not the most powerful lobby, would benefit

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:57.320
[Amit Varma]: if rent control was removed because then they would have so much new construction to do.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.360
[Amit Varma]: Given that, where's the resistance? Where are we stuck?

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:05.480
[Guest]: Yeah, it's hard to understand. I think the point you raised earlier is correct. There

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:12.960
[Guest]: is just a huge social ballast is that the views of the people in general are pro-rent

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.840
[Guest]: control. And that makes it very difficult, even given the incentives of the builders.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:24.320
[Guest]: But because the builders look corrupt, then even, you know, even though they have all

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:30.480
[Guest]: the right incentives, the power of the people actually is too strong here. However, I think

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:35.560
[Guest]: if we had some new cities, that we would not get these rules in place. I think there's

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:41.400
[Guest]: enough understanding. And that's one of the amazing things about India is I think actually,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:47.320
[Guest]: though maybe you'll disagree with me here, I think actually the intellectual class understands

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:54.440
[Guest]: these issues quite well. In speaking with people, you know, economists in India, and

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.720
[Guest]: even people in government at the top levels, I think they actually understand these issues

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:05.480
[Guest]: quite well. But they also feel frozen in place. They also feel that they can't do much about

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.240
[Guest]: them. However, if we had some new cities, maybe then that there would be an opportunity

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.560
[Amit Varma]: to do something new.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.360
[Amit Varma]: Well, India's future is in the cities. And I hope we'll see you more often, both in Mumbai

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.120
[Amit Varma]: and in our new cities. Thank you so much for coming on the show.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.800
[Amit Varma]: Thanks a lot.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:27.280

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:37.720
[Amit Varma]: age of blogs is over, Marginal Revolution is an exception. Anyway, I'm outta here for

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:51.480
