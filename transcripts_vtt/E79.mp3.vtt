00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.040
[Amit Varma]: so similar, if not basically the same, in terms of language, cuisine, dress, cricket,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.520
[Amit Varma]: and even our taste for bad escapist cinema. I'd actually go further and argue that we

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.440
[Amit Varma]: are more than siblings. We're Siamese twins. We're joined at the hip almost literally,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.960
[Amit Varma]: bound not just by culture, but also by geography, and therefore geopolitics. And for this reason,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.400
[Amit Varma]: everything that happens in Pakistan concerns us also. We can't afford to just ignore it.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:07.320
[Amit Varma]: And elections in Pakistan are more important for us than elections in any other country.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.480
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.960
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.720
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. Today's topic is the Pakistan elections of July 25.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.880
[Amit Varma]: Now, this conversation took place on July 23, before the elections, and you're listening

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.200
[Amit Varma]: to it on the Monday after. But that's okay, because what we discussed was not the specific

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.080
[Amit Varma]: result of the specific elections, but the state of Pakistani democracy, and what is

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.000
[Amit Varma]: at stake here. My guests today are my colleagues at the online magazine I edit, Pragati at

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.280
[Amit Varma]: ThinkPragati.com. Pranay Kotastane is our editor for foreign affairs, as well as a fellow

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.560
[Amit Varma]: at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, and one of the most highly regarded foreign

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.960
[Amit Varma]: policy analysts in this country. Hamsini Hariharan is the assistant editor of Pragati and foreign

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.040
[Amit Varma]: policy is also one of her beats. Before we begin the conversation, though, here's a quick

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.920
[Amit Varma]: commercial break. If this happens to be the only podcast you listen to, well, you need

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.880
[Amit Varma]: to listen to some more. Check out the ones from IBM podcast who co produced the show

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.480
[Amit Varma]: to the scene and the unseen. Thanks, Amit. Great to be back. Yeah, thanks for having

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.520
[Amit Varma]: us. So now we're recording this on the 23rd of July and the 25th, obviously the elections

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.400
[Amit Varma]: in Pakistan. So what I wanted this episode to be about is not so much what the outcome

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.680
[Amit Varma]: will be, because it will be known by the time you listen to it, but we don't know it yet.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:19.120
[Amit Varma]: But more about what is the landscape of politics and electoral politics in Pakistan and how

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.640
[Amit Varma]: it's kind of evolved. So Pranay, just give me sort of a quick update, like I'm speaking

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.680
[Amit Varma]: purely from a layman's perspective. What is Pakistani democracy? Is there such a thing?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.520
[Guest 2]: The Pakistani democracy is quite elusive, actually. And that's been perplexing for many

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.960
[Guest 2]: of the people around. And the way we've tried to characterize it is that Pakistan is actually

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.400
[Guest 2]: not one geopolitical entity, but two of them. One is the putative state of Pakistan, which

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.680
[Guest 2]: actually has its flag, a PM, a PM's car, and all that paraphernalia with it. But the more

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.240
[Guest 2]: important one is something what we call the military jihadi complex. Now, the way we define

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:11.320
[Guest 2]: it is that it is a dynamic syndicate of the military, militants, the jihadists, the radicalists,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.960
[Guest 2]: and political economic structures, which basically have their own foreign policy and domestic

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.320
[Guest 2]: policies. And they try to assert their relative dominance over this entire thing called Pakistan.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.960
[Guest 2]: So it is this MJC or the military jihadi complex, which actually is in control of the corridors

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.520
[Guest 2]: of power in Pakistan, and it is the one which determines what will happen. And even in this

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.680
[Guest 2]: election, if you see it, the most important opinion that matters is not the one that comes

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.920
[Guest 2]: out of opinion polls, but the opinion of the military, and the military seems to have made

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.320
[Amit Varma]: its choice. So what's really the history of this military jihadi complex? Like, it hasn't

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.580
[Amit Varma]: always existed, I'm assuming. But at the same time, like, would you say that the dominance

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.760
[Amit Varma]: of the military was something written in the DNA of the Pakistan state in terms of how

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.760
[Guest 2]: it was formed?

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.000
[Guest 2]: Yes, actually, it is, it has been existing since the emergence of Pakistan. And in fact,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.560
[Guest 2]: there is a great book by Steve Wilkinson called Army and the Nation. And it tries to lay out

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.920
[Guest 2]: a comparison between the history of the Indian Army and the history of Pakistani Army and

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:28.920
[Guest 2]: why both of them diverge in terms of the political roles that armies play in both states. And

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.480
[Guest 2]: it's a fascinating account of that. And the military jihadi complex has its root right

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.200
[Guest 2]: from the emergence of Pakistan. There have been several constitutions that Pakistan has

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.880
[Guest 2]: had several stages where the military was in direct control of the government. And even

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:52.160
[Guest 2]: now, even though there is something called a Pakistani PM, do you know who's the Pakistani

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.200
[Guest 2]: PM now, for example?

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.680
[Guest 2]: Give me a minute while I Google it.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:03.000
[Guest 2]: Yeah, right. You need to Google it. I think you might know the PM of some other neighboring

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.200
[Guest 2]: state, but it's difficult. Let's say Maldives, you would know who is right. But in Pakistan,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.120
[Guest 2]: it's difficult because the current guy who's been installed is someone who's not even a

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:19.640
[Guest 2]: big guy in his own political party. He was only installed because Nawaz Sharif sort of

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.760
[Guest 2]: confronted the Pakistani military and the military jihadi complex thought that he was

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.720
[Guest 2]: getting too big for his shoes. And hence he was booted out. So if I have to say what are

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.200
[Guest 2]: the broad trends that have taken place over the last few years, let's look at it first

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:41.960
[Guest 2]: from a foreign policy angle of Pakistan. One, the narrative that the MJC has been selling

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:48.680
[Guest 2]: all these years that they are the protectors of Pakistan and the world would be worse off

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.600
[Guest 2]: if they weren't there. That kind of narrative has weakened over the last few years. The

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.400
[Guest 2]: Americans who are backing the Pakistani military just because they thought there was no better

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.520
[Guest 2]: option, they chose to believe so, are also frustrated with it. So if you see over the

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:11.360
[Guest 2]: last few years, the aid that Pakistan army got has significantly declined. So from a

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:17.320
[Guest 2]: foreign policy angle, there is a pressure. The amount of options that Pakistani army

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:24.280
[Guest 2]: had have reduced now. That's one big thing. In the domestic side, what you saw was last

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:31.000
[Guest 2]: time Nawaz Sharif, his party called the Pakistan Muslim League, Nawaz, won a landslide elections.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.040
[Guest 2]: They won around 178 seats out of 342. And it was the first time when a democratic transition

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:44.000
[Guest 2]: actually took place from one democratic party to the other. Big, big event right after 70

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.080
[Guest 2]: years. And even though that happened, after that Nawaz Sharif sort of did a lot of things

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:56.520
[Guest 2]: to change Pakistan and most importantly, and where the Pakistani military didn't like it

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:02.840
[Guest 2]: is where he started questioning the ISI, etc. on what they have been doing in regulating

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:08.360
[Guest 2]: the jihadists. And this came out as a leaked report in a famous newspaper called Dawn.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:15.040
[Guest 2]: And that's when the Pakistani military started to go behind him. And hence he was overthrown.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.040
[Guest 2]: And he was forced to exit. There was a non entity was made the PM. So these are the two

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.440
[Guest 2]: things. The third one is what is happening on the Pakistani border with Afghanistan,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.440
[Guest 2]: which I guess Hamsini can tell you better. Yeah, something that I wanted to talk about

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:36.600
[Guest 1]: was the rise of the Pashtun Taifus movement. So what's been happening is that since 2015,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.840
[Guest 1]: there's been supposedly a crackdown on the Tariq-e-Taliban Pakistan. And so the Pakistan

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:49.120
[Guest 1]: army launched something called Operation Zarb-e-Azab. And this meant that a lot of people who were

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.600
[Guest 1]: in the area were arbitrarily detained and harassed and all of that. And this is not

00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.960
[Guest 1]: new also in the federally administrated tribal areas of FATA, which comes under, it doesn't

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.000
[Guest 1]: come under the Pakistani constitution. So what happened is from 2015, there have been

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.040
[Guest 2]: small protests. Just to correct, it does come under the Pakistani constitution, but the

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:16.080
[Guest 2]: laws which apply to these people are different from the laws that apply to the other Pakistanis.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.240
[Guest 2]: So there is something called the FCR and their draconian laws. For example, one person doesn't

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.560
[Guest 2]: have one vote in those areas, whereas the other Pakistanis have. Here there is something

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.520
[Guest 2]: called a community vote, things like that. Really crazy colonial stuff, which still continues

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.280
[Guest 1]: to this. Yeah. And another thing is if you do something, then members of your family

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.720
[Guest 1]: will be detained and so on. So they are really draconian laws. So what's happened over the

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.980
[Guest 1]: last year is that this movement started calling for, you know, dignity for the rights of Pashtuns.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:52.200
[Guest 1]: And it's the first grassroots movement in recent history in Pakistan that's managed

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.600
[Guest 1]: to affect an outcome that the Pakistan army was not really favorable to. So one of the

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:03.880
[Guest 1]: things that they were able to do about a month ago was merge two provinces in Pakistan, Khyber

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.880
[Guest 1]: Pakhtunkhwa and FATA. And this has been a demand for a very long time so that there

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.160
[Guest 1]: would be better governance and so on. But this is the first time that the change has

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.600
[Guest 1]: actually been mandated. And this goes on to show that there is a lot of dissatisfaction

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.480
[Guest 1]: on the ground. The people aren't really happy with the way that the civilian government

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.600
[Guest 1]: has been acting simply because the civilian government does not have a lot of power.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.480
[Amit Varma]: And correct me if I'm wrong, but one sense in which this uprising is different from past

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:37.880
[Amit Varma]: uprisings is that past uprisings focused to a certain extent on identity politics and

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.600
[Amit Varma]: Pashtuns versus arrest and so on. While this was really focused strongly on individual

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.800
[Amit Varma]: rights and on just being treated as citizens and so on. Is that a correct formulation?

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:52.400
[Guest 2]: No, I would suggest it is still largely it is being seen as a Pashtun movement itself.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.240
[Guest 2]: The word itself means Pashtun protection movement. But are they agitating for the same sort of

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.320
[Guest 2]: things they were in the past? Yeah, it's not that they are arguing for a Pashtunistan or

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:08.000
[Guest 2]: anything like that. They are arguing for Pashtuns to have the same rights that other Pakistanis

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.400
[Guest 2]: have, essentially that. And the unique thing about this is that the leadership is not affiliated

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:20.200
[Guest 2]: with any political party. So it's tough for the Pakistani army to curb it. They have immense

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.680
[Guest 2]: amount of instruments to curb it, right. And the military jadhi complex excels in that

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:30.520
[Guest 2]: they can manufacture charges, get forced disappearances. It's a very famous term in Pakistan, which

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:36.720
[Guest 2]: is called namalu mafrads. These are unidentified persons, they emerge out of nowhere, and they

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.840
[Guest 2]: will just abduct you. Very, very common happened to a lot of Pashtuns. And in fact, that is

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.280
[Guest 2]: why this entire movement started. And the leader of this, for example, is a guy called

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:53.920
[Guest 2]: Manzoor Pashteen. He's a young chap has no political history. But he went around Fata

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:59.920
[Guest 2]: and there was a march, a lot of people joined him on the way. So it's what Hamsini said

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.320
[Guest 2]: a grassroots movement, which really caught on and the Pakistani army was caught unawares.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:10.320
[Guest 1]: Yeah, and what the movement has done differently from other movements, as Pranay said, is that

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:16.160
[Guest 1]: it didn't take up any political affiliations, even at the end of it after the two provinces

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.040
[Guest 1]: were merged, and a lot of people were saying, you know, what next for the movement? The

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.400
[Guest 1]: leaders of the movement were saying maybe individuals will take up political contest

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.960
[Guest 1]: if they want to, but the movement as such is not going to back anyone. And while it

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:35.160
[Guest 1]: was happening, it was suddenly seen as you know, an important vote that they had never

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.080
[Guest 1]: counted before on because traditionally Pashtun votes go to the PTI that works, the Pakistan

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:48.200
[Guest 1]: Tehreek-e-Insaf, that is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. So this was seen as a new demographic that

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:53.080
[Guest 1]: has never come to the foray before in Pakistan.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.440
[Amit Varma]: And just sort of going back to the first point you made, Pranay, about the army no longer

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.080
[Amit Varma]: the military jihadi complex been weakened over the last few years. And I remember the

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:10.360
[Amit Varma]: early 2000s before 9-11, Pakistan was economically pretty much on the verge of collapse and someone

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.720
[Amit Varma]: like I visited Pakistan to cover the Indian cricket tour of 2006. And I'd also written

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.440
[Amit Varma]: for the Wall Street Journal and so on in that time. And I remember someone at that point

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:25.080
[Amit Varma]: telling me that we think of, we don't call Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda, we call it Al-Faida. Because

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:32.440
[Amit Varma]: what happened with that was that the army suddenly got a spurt of validation and you

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.640
[Amit Varma]: know, it could justify itself in much stronger times, in much stronger terms and a lot of

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.560
[Amit Varma]: funds poured in from abroad because you obviously looked as Pakistan as a key ally in the war

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:47.280
[Amit Varma]: against terror and the military jihadi complex just grew stronger. Now, one reason for the

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.960
[Amit Varma]: military jihadi complex growing weaker, obviously, is that the West has figured out that these

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:58.880
[Amit Varma]: guys are not allies, they are playing a double game. But is it also the case that even domestically,

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.360
[Amit Varma]: people are more empowered or more disillusioned against the army? Is it like a two way thing

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:10.560
[Guest 2]: happening here? Yes, that's true for some section because look at it like this. So Pakistani

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.920
[Guest 2]: military jihadi complex, everyone now knows that they are the ones who are in the driver's

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:22.240
[Guest 2]: seat. And in spite of them being in the driver's seat, things haven't changed a lot, right.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:28.360
[Guest 2]: And in fact, the gap between India and Pakistan has also been widened significantly. So in

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.160
[Guest 2]: a sense, there is this disillusionment that whatever we were promised, and the military

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:39.040
[Guest 2]: being the protectors of the ideological frontiers have not delivered. So there is that sense

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:45.240
[Guest 2]: of alienation which has come in. But because the military jihadi complex is still the most

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.320
[Guest 2]: powerful formation, it can, you know, there are these, for example, every year, there

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.920
[Guest 2]: are these surveys, which keep getting held everywhere. And still Pakistani army gets

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:03.120
[Guest 2]: some 75% ratings in the most trusted institution of Pakistan and all that. So that kind of

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.240
[Guest 2]: continues. But I guess yes, there has been some disillusionment that we aren't getting

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.840
[Guest 2]: what we are. Most recent example, actually, like just yesterday, there have been street

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:20.160
[Guest 2]: protests in Punjab, people saying ISI Murdabad and all that. That's very, very rare for it

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:27.160
[Guest 2]: to happen in Punjab. Second, what has also changed the fact is that there have been terrorist

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:33.480
[Guest 2]: attacks in the heartland of Punjab over the last few years. So that again, has set a question

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:39.080
[Guest 2]: back in the army's court that what happened, you were the guys who are going to protect

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.640
[Guest 2]: us against India and against all the terrorists. But now, even the gardens of you know, there

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:50.920
[Guest 2]: was an attack in a park in Punjab in Lahore. So even those places aren't safe anymore.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:56.720
[Guest 2]: So that has sort of weakened domestically. And would it be your case that you know, when

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.740
[Amit Varma]: Indians typically think of Pakistan as an enemy nation, what they actually thinking

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:05.640
[Amit Varma]: of is a military jihadi complex, and not so much the you know, like Pakistan civil society

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.880
[Amit Varma]: at this point, seems fairly fed up themselves of the military jihadi complex.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:16.000
[Guest 2]: No, that's a very good point. Actually, that's why I was trying to say that look at Pakistan

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.320
[Guest 2]: as two entities, there is this one entity, which you can't probably, you know, sort of

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.680
[Guest 2]: get you on your side, because they have defined their existence as opposing you. And that's

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.560
[Guest 2]: a military jihadi complex, right. So maybe the long term solution for the for that entity

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:39.280
[Guest 2]: is just that resist, we need to resist it for now and hope that we dismantle it in the

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:47.000
[Guest 2]: future or it gets dismantled on its own. But the other side is not inherently inimical

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.800
[Guest 2]: to India or might not be so it at least it can be changed. And an evidence for that is

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:59.640
[Guest 2]: like what you see happening in a Kashmir, for example, over the last two, three years,

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:07.120
[Guest 2]: Pakistan could have done a lot more if it wanted to. And I it's my sort of assertion

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:12.680
[Guest 2]: that actually they haven't done a lot. And a lot of problems which are of the recent

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:18.440
[Guest 2]: times are our own problems and the way we've handled Kashmir politically, but Pakistan

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:23.720
[Guest 2]: has been a peripheral player in this, but it's not been the main person which is doing

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.600
[Guest 2]: things from behind, which was the case a few years ago,

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.680
[Guest 2]: Your case is if they wanted to, they could have, they could have and they didn't. So

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:36.000
[Guest 2]: why didn't they? They didn't because as you see, last few years, Nawaz Sharif was the

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.040
[Guest 2]: one who was trying to assert himself politically. And there were some overtures on both sides.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:49.080
[Guest 2]: And they sort of tried to figure it out that, you know, maybe we need to get our acts in

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.280
[Guest 2]: the domestic sphere first together and then see what we have to do with India. So there

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:58.880
[Guest 2]: was and remember the terrorism increased significantly within Pakistan, right? So there was backlash

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.600
[Guest 2]: internally as well. If Punjab is getting bombed internally, they said, how can we support

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.920
[Guest 2]: terrorism elsewhere? So this entire narrative of Pakistan having backing terrorist elements

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.360
[Guest 2]: sort of had weakened over the last few years, right?

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.840
[Guest 1]: And do you think that this is one of the reasons Nawaz Sharif also faced pushback from the

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.120
[Guest 1]: army that he was trying to control terrorism and didn't let the terrorists affect what

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.120
[Guest 2]: was happening?

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.720
[Guest 2]: He was questioning those guys. And that's what the report in Dawn said. And that was

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:37.000
[Guest 2]: a bit too much to ask. And that's why what happened and he was declared that he was not

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.760
[Guest 2]: sadiq and amin, right?

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:44.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, what is a sadiq and amin? You told me before you began recording, but for the benefit

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.520
[Guest 2]: of the listeners.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:51.760
[Guest 2]: It's fascinating Pakistan has so current constitution, which is in force in Pakistan was the one

00:19:51.760 --> 00:20:00.320
[Guest 2]: which started in 1973. And after that, an article was inserted in Zia ul Haq's time,

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:08.400
[Guest 2]: an article 62, which said that a person who is elected to the legislative assembly, he

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:14.040
[Guest 2]: should have adequate knowledge of Islamic teachings and practices on the obligatory

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:20.160
[Guest 2]: duties prescribed by Islam, and he should abstain from major sins. And the clause also

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.600
[Guest 2]: said that candidate should be sadiq and amin. So it means honest and righteous. Now you

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:32.680
[Guest 2]: can understand how vague this is. So the Pakistani military jihadi complex often uses this clause

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:39.240
[Guest 2]: to just take people out which whom they don't like, and the way they do now is very intelligent.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:46.160
[Guest 2]: So earlier, like back until the 1990s, they could just overthrow the political outfits

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:52.320
[Guest 2]: and the army guys could become the president and military martial law administrators like

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:58.040
[Guest 2]: what Pervez Musharraf, Zia ul Haq and all those guys did. But now, there will be a backlash

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:03.240
[Guest 2]: internationally even within Pakistan, right? So what they do is more intelligent things,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:08.520
[Guest 2]: more sophisticated things, they get the judiciary to front this. So the judiciary will say that,

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:14.880
[Guest 2]: okay, Nawaz Sharif has been involved in Panama paper leaks, and he is no longer sadiq and

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.680
[Guest 2]: amin. So he should be thrown off. And then you have this entire set of another guy coming

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:26.320
[Guest 2]: in who the Pakistani army wants, which is quite marvelous. Yeah, in fact, that's why

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:33.640
[Guest 1]: the recent dismissal of Nawaz Sharif and his putting an arrest out for him for 10 years,

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.200
[Guest 1]: he's supposed to be jailed. It was called judicial coup, because that's what it was.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.440
[Guest 1]: It was orchestrated by the Pakistan army. So the army basically controls the judiciary

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.280
[Amit Varma]: and uses it as a tool when it wants to. Yeah. So you know, I want to ask you guys about

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.600
[Amit Varma]: the current elections. But before I do that, a slightly deeper question going back to the

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.040
[Amit Varma]: background that you were giving me before the start of the episode about the army's

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:04.040
[Amit Varma]: predominant role in Pakistani politics, which is so different from the army's role in India

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:11.840
[Amit Varma]: and thank goodness for that. And can you give me a TLDR of how the Pakistani army, the military

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:19.240
[Amit Varma]: jihadi complex as it has become now, became dominant in Pakistan politics right from 47.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:25.040
[Amit Varma]: And if that is a structural reason, then why should it change now? I mean, is there any

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:30.800
[Guest 2]: hope of it ever changing? Yeah, the structural reason for the Pakistan

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:36.800
[Guest 2]: army's dominance was, now Pakistan was born a very insecure state, right? And it always

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:43.440
[Guest 2]: perceived it so. So for the first few years, the biggest chunk of their budgetary allocation

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:49.320
[Guest 2]: was in defense itself. So, in a sense, it was the army and the armed forces which got

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:56.040
[Guest 2]: a head start over the other institutions. And in a fragile state, which was just beginning,

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:01.960
[Guest 2]: it was only the army which sort of seemed to work, right? And remember, during the British

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:08.320
[Guest 2]: times as well, they had allocated big canal colonies along the Indus and given it to the

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:13.480
[Guest 2]: military guys, etc. So, these were also the people who were the richer ones, the well-educated

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:20.280
[Guest 2]: ones, and now also more important from a public finance point of view. So, these people had

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:27.680
[Guest 2]: a head start and that sort of they then you had the first coup which came up and you had

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:33.360
[Guest 2]: Ayub Khan taking over the reins. So, it was born that way, you know, and that sort of

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:41.480
[Guest 2]: has continued. The army has never allowed the other putative state to actually emerge.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.800
[Amit Varma]: And was it like, as in our case, was there ever a sort of constitution which tried to

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.400
[Guest 2]: lay down the rules of the game? Or how did that go? Yeah, the often the constitution

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:57.120
[Guest 2]: was made by the army guys itself. After they ruled, they had a new constitution, it changed,

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:05.200
[Guest 2]: etc. So, it always tried to give a veneer of democracy and a legitimacy which you would

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:11.280
[Guest 2]: find acceptable, but always it was clear where the power center lay. And to your question

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:18.040
[Guest 2]: of whether it will change or not, the only thing sort of which can change is if this

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:23.920
[Guest 2]: Pakistani military jihadi complex is no longer seen as the one which can deliver the goods

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:30.120
[Guest 2]: for the Pakistanis. And I guess, at least the trend is now in a direction where Pakistanis

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:36.860
[Guest 2]: themselves are questioning where we are going with what we've done. And, you know, the countries

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:42.440
[Guest 2]: around Pakistan have managed to do much better things. So, they are questioning that. And

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:47.760
[Guest 2]: that's why you are seeing a lot of this civil unrest with the PTM, etc., which is coming

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.240
[Amit Varma]: up. And therein lies the hope, I guess. In fact, this is why I keep saying that, you

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.640
[Amit Varma]: know, just because we view Pakistan as the enemy, which as you correctly pointed out,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.480
[Amit Varma]: there are two aspects of Pakistan and the military jihadi complex as enemy, just because

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.520
[Amit Varma]: of that, we shouldn't cut down on trade with them. In fact, if anything, we should expand

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.520
[Amit Varma]: free trade with them, we should expand person to person relations, because all of those

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:14.320
[Amit Varma]: things will only strengthen Pakistani civil society vis-a-vis the military jihadi complex.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.960
[Amit Varma]: So that is sort of another front in the battle we have to fight against.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:23.640
[Guest 2]: Right. But I would say, I have a slightly different take to it, at least we shouldn't

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:30.480
[Guest 2]: think of all these big overtures, you know, a PM meeting a PM and all that, because the

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:36.960
[Guest 2]: past evidence shows that whenever such big jhumlas take place, immediately after that,

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:41.760
[Guest 2]: the military jihadi complex strikes back. There is instance after instance where this

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:48.720
[Guest 2]: has happened. So, it's better to not, you know, insert a finger into the eyes of the

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:54.840
[Guest 2]: MJC by doing these big events. Yeah, you could do it at a first start with a back channel

00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:01.600
[Guest 2]: talks, NSAs to NSAs, and then slowly open people to people contacts, but anything which

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:06.640
[Guest 2]: is big, which questions the military jihadi complex, who's, you know, the foundation of

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:12.120
[Guest 2]: that is that they are going to protect against India, right? So, if you start to question

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:17.000
[Amit Varma]: that, then MJC strikes back. So, like the MJC, maybe what you're saying is MJC may be

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.360
[Amit Varma]: wounded and insecure, but they're still the biggest beast in the room and you don't want

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:25.880
[Amit Varma]: to roil them up too much. We'll shift to talking about the current elections, which I find

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:30.200
[Amit Varma]: hopelessly complicated and hard to understand right after a brief commercial break.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.680
[Unknown]: Hey, it's been another great week on IBM. If you aren't following us on social media,

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.240

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.800
[Unknown]: now, onto your shelves.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:14.920
[Amit Varma]: Pranay and Hamsini, welcome back to the scene and the unseen. So, help me make sense of

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:20.920
[Amit Varma]: what's happening in these elections. You've had Nawaz Sharif sort of being defined against

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:25.400
[Amit Varma]: a military jihadist complex, which is on the downswing both in terms of what the world

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:31.040
[Amit Varma]: thinks of it and in terms of dealing with domestic matters. So, they've used the Supreme

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.680
[Amit Varma]: Court as a puppet to get Nawaz out of the way. They've installed a puppet prime minister.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.680
[Amit Varma]: And now you have elections coming up. So, lay it out for me. What's at stake here? Who

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.600
[Guest 1]: are the players in this game? And what's likely to happen?

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:48.480
[Guest 1]: Before we get into these elections, I think it'll be good if Pranay, you told us how the

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.120
[Guest 1]: National Assembly elections in Pakistan actually work, right? With respect to vote shares in

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.240
[Guest 2]: provinces and so on.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:05.800
[Guest 2]: Yeah. So, think of it this way, that the electoral seats, basically Pakistan is dominated by

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:13.360
[Guest 2]: one state. Okay. So, the total number of seats in the assembly are 342. Not all of them go

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.800
[Guest 2]: for elections. They are sort of, some of them are reserved seats, etc.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.000
[Guest 1]: For minorities and women.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.800
[Guest 2]: Yeah, minorities and women. So, around 270 will go to vote in these elections. Now, the

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:35.880
[Guest 2]: Punjab dominance is that nearly 170 seats out of 342 belong to Punjab. Okay. So, the

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:42.000
[Guest 2]: second highest state, which is Sindh, it is less than half of that number. It has 75 seats.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.560
[Guest 2]: So, anyone who controls Punjab sort of is the big person in town. In the last elections

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:56.400
[Guest 2]: now, Nawaz Sharif's party really sweeped the entire Punjab. Okay. And they had close to

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:04.880
[Guest 2]: 178 seats or something like that. So, because of that, they were the big party there. Now,

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:11.400
[Guest 2]: what's happening now? Because PMLN has now lost favor of the Pakistani military jihadi

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.800
[Guest 2]: complex, there are some other formations who are coming up. Now, there is something called

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:22.520
[Guest 2]: the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, which is led by Imran Khan and his election symbol obviously

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:28.480
[Guest 2]: is a cricket bat. I don't know why not a ball, but it's a cricket bat. So, Imran Khan is

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:34.360
[Guest 2]: the, his party actually rules this thing called the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which is another state.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:40.120
[Guest 2]: That state just has now 50 seats totally. These are the two big formations. The third

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:45.600
[Guest 2]: formation is the Pakistani People's Party, which is Benazir Bhutto's party. Now, it is

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:52.520
[Guest 2]: being led by her son. Now, over the time, PPP's influence has waned. And even in these

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:58.520
[Guest 2]: elections, it is only restricted to sins that they might perform well. These are the three

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:04.400
[Guest 2]: big parties. Some other parties are now Pakistani military jihadi complex is also trying to

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:09.960
[Guest 2]: mainstream militants. So, there is always like a palimpsest of militants who keep coming

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:16.960
[Guest 2]: into the electoral setup. Earlier, you had some jihadi elements. Now, you have these

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:23.800
[Guest 2]: guys Hafiz Saeed has a party called the Milli Muslim League that might contest. So, there

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.800
[Guest 2]: are... And they are backed by the military jihadi complex. Yeah, it is a part of the

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.880
[Guest 2]: military jihadi. They are the jihadi part of the military jihadi. So, it is very clear

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:37.440
[Guest 2]: they are trying to mainstream it. There are militant Barelvi outfits also. There is a

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:43.520
[Guest 2]: Pakistani Labaik party. And they are also trying. So, there are many, many layers of

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:50.440
[Guest 2]: these militant guys who are also sort of contesting. So, these are the main guys in the elections.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:58.120
[Guest 2]: Now, Pakistani army has made its choice. It looks like Imran Khan is their man and a few

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.480
[Guest 2]: reasons for that. First, they hated the PM and Nawaz Sharif. And even though Nawaz Sharif

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:08.760
[Guest 2]: won't be contesting elections, they fear that his family will still be in control and he

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:13.120
[Guest 2]: might again come back. So, they are trying to restrict them. They are doing that in a

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:21.040
[Guest 2]: few ways. One, they are obviously helping Imran Khan project his party's name everywhere.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.680
[Guest 2]: Second, they have split the Pakistani Muslim League itself. And there was this Interior

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:32.120
[Guest 2]: Minister Nisar Chaudhary who was from the Nawaz Sharif faction. Now, he split from the

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:38.120
[Guest 2]: PMLN and he is contesting elections alone. And he was allotted the symbol of a jeep,

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:43.560
[Guest 2]: which very obviously evokes images of the Pakistani military itself. And not only did

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:50.440
[Guest 2]: that happen, a lot of people started quitting PMLN. And by some strange luck, a lot of these

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:57.000
[Guest 2]: independents have been given the jeep symbol. So, this is like the jeep party. So, this

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.160
[Guest 2]: is the jeep party, which is sort of, they don't call themselves a party, by the way.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:07.400
[Guest 2]: They are saying we are not a group, but we know what it is.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:14.720
[Guest 2]: What might happen is because PTI does not have a great presence in Punjab, these jeepers

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:21.640
[Guest 2]: plus the PTI might collaborate and you might have a formation which can run.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:27.480
[Amit Varma]: And also Imran in the past has sort of shown his sympathy for militants anyway. Of course.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:32.400
[Amit Varma]: So he's always sort of been, you know, wanting to get into the good books of the military

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.120
[Guest 2]: jihadi complex. Yeah, he is. I mean, the party was started

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:42.920
[Guest 2]: by, now the interesting thing is even Nawaz Sharif's party was bankrolled by the Pakistani

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.960
[Guest 2]: army back in the 80s when Benazir Bhutto was just rising. This was late 80s.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.720
[Guest 2]: So as a counterpoint to that. So, there was this formation called the IJI,

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:58.520
[Guest 2]: which was formed and Nawaz Sharif was a businessman who was brought in to do this. But over time,

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:03.960
[Guest 2]: Nawaz Sharif now with, you know, 30 years of politics behind him wanted to do things

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:08.320
[Guest 2]: his own way and that was too much for the Pakistani army.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:15.240
[Guest 2]: So now you have another case here and they are trying to form this party called the PTI.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:22.720
[Guest 2]: Obviously, they emerge, they come up every time the Pakistani army wants them to do,

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:28.560
[Guest 2]: wants them to create all these noises. So yes, it looks like they are the Pakistani

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.600
[Amit Varma]: army's guys. All very entertaining. So, is the army also

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.400
[Amit Varma]: going to rig the elections in a manner of speaking? Because like there is an army person

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.960
[Amit Varma]: at every booth, for example, they're pretty much controlling the physical logistics.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:45.160
[Guest 2]: Yeah. So that's, that's the interesting thing. And I don't know how that would work out.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:52.160
[Guest 2]: My guess is they have already rigged the election. You don't need to rig the ballot process to

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:58.160
[Guest 2]: rig an election, right? You can rig it. They'll just put Nawaz Sharif behind bars, put his

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.520
[Guest 2]: daughter behind bars. So, I mean, if that is not rigging, what is?

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:08.480
[Guest 1]: You face so many insurmountable difficulties. And I think you wouldn't want to rig the election

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:14.240
[Guest 1]: anymore because the army still wants that veneer of credibility, right? At some point,

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:18.440
[Guest 1]: they still, they've always maintained the prop of a civilian government to show that

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:24.720
[Guest 1]: there is some aspect of democracy within Pakistan. So if they go any further, then I think they

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.160
[Guest 1]: will be tipping that balance and they won't want to do that necessarily because then they

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.960
[Amit Varma]: can go back to military rule. But does that matter anymore? Because everyone

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.320
[Amit Varma]: in the international community, for example, knows the real score anywhere, right?

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:40.760
[Guest 1]: No, I think it does matter because recently Pakistan has been put on the FATF, right?

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:47.320
[Guest 2]: The Financial Action Task Force, for not cracking down on terrorism and money laundry and things

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:51.440
[Amit Varma]: like that. And I don't know, what do you think, Pranay?

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:58.240
[Guest 2]: I think the difference this time is because Nawaz Sharif is extremely popular still. And

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:03.600
[Guest 2]: in fact, after what the army has done to him and put him behind jail, etc, there's a greater

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.720
[Guest 2]: sympathy wave for him as well. So he's no walkover either. He's a seasoned politician.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:14.960
[Guest 2]: So if the Pakistan army goes overboard, there might be, you know, pushback from the supporters

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:20.480
[Guest 2]: of Nawaz Sharif, which didn't exist earlier because, you know, there was only one game

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.600
[Guest 2]: in town earlier. But now there is at least a hint of some political opposition.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.840
[Amit Varma]: Is there space for such a backlash to express itself? I mean, if it's basically an army

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.760
[Amit Varma]: run country, they can just clamp down on any dissent, right?

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:40.520
[Guest 2]: Yeah, that might well happen. And in fact, that's what is happening. But for example,

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:46.040
[Guest 2]: there were a lot of protests in favor of Nawaz Sharif as well. And, you know, voices were

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:51.200
[Guest 2]: raised even after he was removed because of this clause. So in a sense, they won't be

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.880
[Guest 2]: able to keep it under wraps if this happens. So there will be some fallout, there will

00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:00.880
[Guest 2]: be protests, which I don't know whether they are ready to take that challenge.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:06.440
[Guest 1]: Yeah. So when he was debarred from government, right, he did a long march from Islamabad

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:12.720
[Guest 1]: to Lahore, saying, you know, yes, I've been debarred from office, but I still have clout.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:17.040
[Guest 1]: And similarly, when the judgment now that sentenced him to 10 years of prison was out,

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:22.000
[Guest 1]: he and his daughter were actually in London and protesters stormed through the apartment

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.400
[Guest 1]: and eventually he chose to come back to Pakistan, even though he knew he was facing arrest.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.200
[Guest 1]: And I think these are all symbolic of the fact that the Sharifs know that there is a

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.400
[Guest 1]: sympathy wave for them, that they will command it in that sense.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's which is kind of ironic, given that they were once cronies themselves in

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.680
[Guest 2]: a sense of the army, like you pointed out.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:45.040
[Guest 2]: Yeah, that is true. But you know, once you have power, I guess the logic of power works

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:51.840
[Guest 2]: differently and I think he probably thought that he can do more things on his term rather.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.400
[Amit Varma]: Power changes everybody. I mean, power is like the most fascinating subject of modern

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.400
[Amit Varma]: times.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:01.200
[Guest 1]: There is this famous quote from the Harry Potter, right? When Voldemort in the first

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:06.960
[Guest 1]: book says, there is only power in those who are too weak to seek it. And I think that's

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.960
[Guest 1]: a great way to explain what is happening in Pakistani politics.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:17.720
[Amit Varma]: A profound geopolitical insight from someone who lost. Times do change and power does shift.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.720
[Amit Varma]: So okay, so here's the million dollar question then. All this is happening in Pakistan, the

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:27.160
[Amit Varma]: military jihadi complex is asserting itself and Imran might, interestingly, our listeners

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:32.360
[Amit Varma]: will know this as they're listening to the podcast, we don't at the time of speaking,

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:36.760
[Amit Varma]: Imran might come to power or whatever happens. What are the repercussions for India?

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:42.500
[Guest 2]: So from the Indian angle, these elections don't really matter. They are all interesting

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.960
[Guest 2]: for us to observe. But still, what we are seeing is the military jihadi complex, we

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:55.960
[Guest 2]: have to face that particular side of the equation. And there will be someone who will be a crony

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:01.840
[Guest 2]: of the military jihadi complex. Earlier, you at least had some guy who could question the

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:07.160
[Guest 2]: military jihadi complex in a limited sense. But yes, there was now you will end up with

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:13.280
[Guest 2]: the situation where there is a military jihadi complex and the political party is just going

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:20.280
[Guest 2]: to relay whatever they want them to relay. So we have no other option but to try to see

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:29.320
[Guest 2]: how this military jihadi complex's role can be managed. And that's what we are left with.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:34.180
[Amit Varma]: And what is Imran's attitude towards India in terms of his public utterances and so on?

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:38.400
[Guest 2]: What is his approach? Extremely antagonistic towards India. He's,

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:44.320
[Guest 2]: in fact, his favorite criticism of any of his political opponents is they are India

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:50.120
[Guest 2]: supporters, or they did something which was in India's interests or something. And everyone

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:56.520
[Guest 2]: for them is a raw agent. So that's the standard thing with PTI. It won't change.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:02.840
[Amit Varma]: Right. And we are also no doubt raw agents. Pranay and Namsini, thanks a lot for coming
