00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.120
[Amit Varma]: Too many of us think of the world in terms of binaries. That makes it easy to make sense

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.400
[Amit Varma]: of the world. The most common binary is that of good and evil. That's why mainstream commercial

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.280
[Amit Varma]: cinema has heroes who are good and villains who are bad. Keep it simple for the audiences.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.120
[Amit Varma]: Make it easy to root for one side over the other. That's why there are so few nuanced

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.020
[Amit Varma]: gods in religion. And even in our politics, in an age where so much has become so tribal,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.640
[Amit Varma]: we think in binaries. It's an easy way to make sense of a complex world. In these pandemic

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.600
[Amit Varma]: times, one binary that is all around us is that of the lockdown. So much of the discourse

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.120
[Amit Varma]: behaves as if there are two possible ways to act. One, have a lockdown. Two, have no

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.320
[Amit Varma]: lockdown. But the truth is that this is not a binary choice, but a continuum along which

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.000
[Amit Varma]: many other options exist. The best option, in fact, might be one in which we don't have

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.360
[Amit Varma]: a complete lockdown, but nor do we let the pandemic get out of control. What are these

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.640
[Amit Varma]: gradations? How can they be calibrated? What kind of metrics do we need to determine how

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.200
[Amit Varma]: much of a lockdown is needed? And what kind of data do we need to make good decisions?

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.720
[Amit Varma]: Most importantly, given the nature of our politics, and given how incompetent and ill-equipped

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.960
[Amit Varma]: our governments are, can good ideas even be implemented in practice?

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.920
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.400
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.600
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen. My last episode on COVID-19 was recorded in the middle

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.400
[Amit Varma]: of April with Shruti Rajgopalan. When I think of the time that has passed since then, it

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.760
[Amit Varma]: feels like it went by in the blink of an eye. When I think of all that has happened in that

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.160
[Amit Varma]: time, it feels like an eternity. There has been so much pain and suffering across the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.240
[Amit Varma]: world, and especially across India, that I sometimes feel guilty to even be able to live

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.520
[Amit Varma]: a relatively normal life. There is so much to process about all that happened. Shruti

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.880
[Amit Varma]: and I spoke about how policymakers were faced with thankless choices at that time. No matter

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.720
[Amit Varma]: what they did, countless lives would be lost, and that cost would be viscerally visible.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.520
[Amit Varma]: It would be seen, while any counterfactual would be unseen. And there is no way to calculate

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.080
[Amit Varma]: all the costs of any action, even in hindsight. For example, we know that the lockdown has

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.220
[Amit Varma]: been a disaster. There have been massive humanitarian costs, especially among the poor. Not having

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.400
[Amit Varma]: a lockdown could also have been a disaster, as our healthcare systems could have been

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.600
[Amit Varma]: overwhelmed, and again, the poor would have suffered the most. And it's easy to say that

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.280
[Amit Varma]: hey, do a lockdown but implement it well so suffering is minimal. But while that sounds

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.780
[Amit Varma]: good on paper, given how poor our state capacity is, that might have been utopian to aim for.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.840
[Amit Varma]: In fact, as I argued in a column a few weeks ago, what India may have learned from this

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.960
[Amit Varma]: is that our flailing state is a bigger disaster than COVID-19. That earlier episode and the

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.900
[Amit Varma]: column will be linked from the show notes. Today's episode, though, doesn't focus only

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.860
[Amit Varma]: on what has happened in the last few weeks, but also on what we can do moving forward.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.400
[Amit Varma]: My guest is Anoop Malani, a polymath public intellectual based in Chicago, who has a degree

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.840
[Amit Varma]: in law, a PhD in economics, and has worked closely in health economics over the last

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.440
[Amit Varma]: decade and a half. He has written papers on past pandemics, the insights from which inform

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.920
[Amit Varma]: many of his thoughts on the current one. And he's not a believer in pontificating from

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.280
[Amit Varma]: a distance. For years, he has been advising governments and working closely with them

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.560
[Amit Varma]: to bring about actual change on the ground. And in the case of COVID-19 as well, Anoop

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.120
[Amit Varma]: has put forward a plan for coming out of lockdown that aims to minimize death and suffering.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.080
[Amit Varma]: It's a nuanced plan based around what he calls adaptive controls. It takes a position that

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.060
[Amit Varma]: both removing the lockdown completely and keeping it going as is are impractical solutions

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.800
[Amit Varma]: with huge costs. Instead, we need to have an approach by which we lift controls to varying

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.440
[Amit Varma]: degrees depending on local conditions, and we keep adapting to new data. He elaborates

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.800
[Amit Varma]: upon this in this conversation. And he also shares his larger thoughts on what the state

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.440
[Amit Varma]: and society can learn from this pandemic. We spend the first 40 minutes of a conversation

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.840
[Amit Varma]: exploring his personal evolution as a thinker, which I found fascinating. And we start talking

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.840
[Amit Varma]: about COVID-19 after the break around the 40 minute mark. Before we begin this conversation,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.680
[Amit Varma]: though, let's take a quick commercial break. If you enjoy listening to the scene and the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.560
[Amit Varma]: unseen, you can play a part in keeping the show alive. The scene and the unseen has been

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.840
[Amit Varma]: a labor of love. I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.040
[Amit Varma]: my brain and my universe, and hopefully yours as well. But while the work has been its own

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.160
[Amit Varma]: reward, I don't actually make much money off the show. Although the scene and the unseen

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.280
[Amit Varma]: is great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken up to the insane engagement level of

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.760
[Amit Varma]: podcasts. I do many, many hours of deep research for each episode. Besides all the logistics

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.880
[Amit Varma]: of producing the show myself, scheduling guests, booking studios, paying technicians, the travel

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.960
[Amit Varma]: and so on. So well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going. And that involves

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.200
[Amit Varma]: you. My proposition for you is this. For every episode of the scene and the unseen that you

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.640
[Amit Varma]: enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth. You can

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.200
[Amit Varma]: do this by heading over to seen unseen.in slash support and contributing an amount of

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.040
[Amit Varma]: your choice. This is not a subscription. The scene and the unseen will continue to be free

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.120
[Amit Varma]: on all podcast apps and at seen unseen.in. This is just a gesture of appreciation. Help

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.920
[Amit Varma]: keep the scene going. seen unseen.in slash support.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.880
[Amit Varma]: Anoop, welcome to the scene and the unseen. Thank you. Happy to be here. So Anoop, you

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.440
[Amit Varma]: know, before we get to the subject at hand, which is the pandemic and the lockdown and

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.000
[Amit Varma]: the difficult few months that we've been having, tell me a little bit about your background,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.760
[Amit Varma]: because I was sort of looking at your background and your CV and all of that. And it seemed

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.240
[Amit Varma]: to me that you're like the Forrest Gump of academics, you did a law degree, you clerked

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.480
[Amit Varma]: in the Supreme Court in the US, you did an econ PhD. And, you know, you've also written

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.880
[Amit Varma]: a lot of papers on medical and healthcare issues. So where did it all start? Where did

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.560
[Amit Varma]: the journey begin? What did you want to do when you were a kid?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.000
[Guest]: Yeah, that's a great question. I do feel a little bit like the Forrest Gump of academics

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.980
[Guest]: and also the real world, doing all those different things actually puts you in interesting places

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.640
[Guest]: at different times. So I got a chance to see, for example, 9-11 up close. But let's see,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.200
[Guest]: I think it probably started in high school, you know, typical Indian immigrant kid, parents

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.160
[Guest]: wanted me to be a doctor. And, you know, I think I probably wanted to satisfy my parents,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.880
[Guest]: but my parents have very high standards. So, you know, again, classic situation. In seventh

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:24.800
[Guest]: or eighth grade, I did a science fair project where I tried to see the impact of radiation

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.000
[Guest]: on mice. So this was back in the 1980s. There was still a real concern about nuclear war.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.840
[Guest]: And so I thought it'd be interesting to x-ray mice to see what the impact of radiation would

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:40.200
[Guest]: be on health. And so mice weren't easy to work with. My dad was a doctor, so was my

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.560
[Guest]: mom, but my dad was a doctor. And he said he would figure out a way for me to irradiate

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.160
[Guest]: the mice at his hospital, the hospital that he had privileges at. And so we went and we

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.600
[Guest]: irradiated the mice. And then I tracked the mice for, I don't know, I guess weeks just

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.000
[Guest]: to see what their IgG levels were over time. And I think my parents were super excited

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.680
[Guest]: because they thought that I was interested in medicine. And what I realized back then

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.280
[Guest]: was that I was actually interested in the research component of it. And so that science

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:15.120
[Guest]: experiment went well, more for me than the mice. And then I decided that I would be a

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:21.680
[Guest]: little bit interested in research. In high school, I decided I would debate. And I don't

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.840
[Guest]: know if you've ever debated, but debate is basically about making, not just learning

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.360
[Guest]: how to make arguments, but making other people's arguments and leveraging those arguments in

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.440
[Guest]: order to win a debate. And what I always thought during this process was, why am I only repeating

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.400
[Guest]: what other people's arguments are? Wouldn't it be more interesting if I could make those

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.640
[Guest]: arguments myself? That is to say, do the research that would help other people make arguments.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.360
[Guest]: And so I think those are the two things I had going off to college. The other thing

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.540
[Guest]: I had was, you know, in high school, my form of rebellion wasn't to cut my hair in strange

00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:00.280
[Guest]: ways or to, you know, wear crazy clothes. My rebellion was to decide not to become a

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:06.680
[Guest]: doctor, which, you know, in a family constitutes rebellion, which is not to say I wasn't going

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.360
[Guest]: to go to college. It was just I was going to do something other than medicine. So when

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.960
[Guest]: I went off, went to college, I initially majored in political science, mainly because that

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:22.880
[Guest]: seemed to flow naturally from the debate activities I was doing in high school. And then in college,

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:30.520
[Guest]: I got to take some math courses, and I realized I enjoyed math a lot more than political science.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.640
[Guest]: And so while my major was political science, it's really just math classes I took for my

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.000
[Guest]: last two years, mainly at least. That's my main memory is the math classes. I remember

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.200
[Guest]: almost nothing about my political science classes.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:49.480
[Guest]: And sometime around my fourth year, I must have been in my third year. So I was at Georgetown

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.760
[Guest]: University in Washington, D.C., and there's a famous bookstore called Kramer's Books in

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.000
[Guest]: DuPont Circle. And I would go there with some frequency and just kind of hang out. And they

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.720
[Guest]: also had a coffee shop. So back in the day, so in the 1990s, that was still relatively

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:08.720
[Guest]: novel. I would go and, you know, have a coffee, read books. And I happened upon a book by

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.520
[Guest]: Gary Becker. I think it's called The Economic Approach to Human Behavior.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:20.040
[Guest]: And I, for some time, because of debate, just being curious, you know, tried to understand

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.360
[Guest]: how humans behave. Just, you know, I think everybody does this, try to figure out what

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.800
[Guest]: the world, how it functions so that they can figure out their role in it and how to interact

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.080
[Guest]: with it. And so I was doing the same thing, except, you know, I had a little bit of math

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.320
[Guest]: in my pocket. And so I, you know, was always trying to figure out how everything fit together,

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.800
[Guest]: you know, why I was attracted to the concept of democracy or, you know, what this notion

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.080
[Guest]: of this thing called rights is and how it made sense and how, what role should the government

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.680
[Guest]: play, you know, just kind of standard stuff that a political scientist would think about,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.400
[Guest]: but from a mathematical perspective. And I can never really get it all organized in my

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.320
[Guest]: head. I had intuitions, but not a structure. And all of a sudden I happened upon this book

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:04.120
[Guest]: and it's an amazing book. And for the first time, I realized that people have been thinking

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.680
[Guest]: in a similar way. I remember I wasn't an economics major. I was a political science major. I

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.520
[Guest]: wasn't reading Chicago economics at the time, certainly not Becker. And so this is the first

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.280
[Guest]: time I had an eye-opening experience where I said, look, this person is thinking the

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:22.320
[Guest]: way that I want to think using the tools that I'd like to be able to use. And really I want

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:27.520
[Guest]: to study with this person or, you know, do similar sorts of stuff. So then I decided

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.800
[Guest]: to apply to grad school in economics. Now I had a political science background, but

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.200
[Guest]: I'd taken a lot of math classes and had some chances. So that was one decision I made.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.960
[Guest]: I was going to apply to economics grad school. The other thing is that I was at Georgetown.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.520
[Guest]: And if I remember correctly, my class, something like, I was in this program called the School

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.120
[Guest]: of Foreign Service. It wasn't the right best fit for me, but it was a program that I was

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:55.560
[Guest]: in where you studied, your focus was international more than, say, domestic. And my recollection

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.360
[Guest]: was something like 50 or 75% of students applied to law school. I'm not saying all of them

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.800
[Guest]: went to law school, but 75% I heard had applied to law school. So, you know, I'm a young kid,

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.940
[Guest]: so I'm going to do what the crowd does too. So I decided I would also apply to law schools.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.640
[Guest]: So I applied to law schools and economics grad schools. And the only place that I got

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.960
[Guest]: into both was the University of Chicago. So that's how I got to the University of Chicago.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.200
[Guest]: And so you know the background there. At the University of Chicago, the very first class

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.200
[Guest]: you take in the economics department is with Gary Becker. Well, the first microeconomics

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.120
[Guest]: classes. So this is fantastic for me. This is exactly what I'd hoped for. I felt so lucky

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:38.160
[Guest]: that I had this opportunity. Around this time, I also met a person named Jim Heckman. So

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:44.560
[Guest]: Jim Heckman was teaching, I think he taught the second quarter econometrics course. And

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:50.440
[Guest]: I didn't have an interest in statistics before grad school. And then I met Jim Heckman. And

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:57.360
[Guest]: Jim, you know, kind of introduces you to the idea of causal inference, which is to say,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.840
[Guest]: you know, if you say X causes Y, in order to say that, you have to say if there was

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:09.320
[Guest]: not X, you would not necessarily or you have less probability of getting outcome Y. And

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.320
[Guest]: how do you think very formally about that kind of statement? And so he introduced something

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.000
[Guest]: called a potential outcomes framework, which I thought was fascinating. Obviously, he'd

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.400
[Guest]: been, you know, had seminal work in the late 1970s that introduced this concept, kind of

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:27.160
[Guest]: in parallel with Don Rubin. And so it was fantastic. And he and I hit it off. And so

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:33.440
[Guest]: the second year I was there, I think I was his TA for that course. And so there was those

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.840
[Guest]: were the two kind of big influences. We can talk about some of the other people I met

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.120
[Guest]: along the way, but but those are the two big influences that I had. And then Chicago is

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:49.720
[Guest]: a very strange place. Chicago is, you know, I think everybody associates with market economics.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.360
[Guest]: And they take that approach very seriously in all aspects. So Chicago is also known as

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.440
[Guest]: a place that provides very little support. So when you start out, you have to, even if

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.000
[Guest]: you're a third year student or fourth year student, you got to make it on your own. What

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.480
[Guest]: does that mean? That means you figure out what papers to write, you write them, and

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.240
[Guest]: hopefully you're successful on the market, especially in the 1990s. There was no sense

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.560
[Guest]: that the graduate program was there to support you in your efforts on the market. Sure, you

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.080
[Guest]: can get a recommendation, but it was really incumbent upon you to come up with a paper,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:25.200
[Guest]: incumbent upon you to kind of get out there, you'll, you know, the thought was, if you're

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.920
[Guest]: good, you don't really need a recommendation, your paper should do all the work for you.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.320
[Guest]: And so I knew this during this time. And I was among a group of people that were quite

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.440
[Guest]: star, you know, that turned out to be stars. And while I did well, I was always worried

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.000
[Guest]: that these people were going to, there are not that many academic jobs out there in top

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.560
[Guest]: places. And so I was always worried, you know, what was going to happen. So some of the names

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.040
[Guest]: actually will be names that now many people will kind of appreciate. Yvonne Wernering,

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:57.720
[Guest]: MIT, Ed Vitlasil, I think he's at Yale, Matthias Dabke, who's made quite an impact in macro

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.240
[Guest]: and family economics, among others. And so I started worrying.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.040
[Amit Varma]: I was actually very curious about the Gary Becker connection. Because you know, when

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.720
[Amit Varma]: I read that he was one of your advisors, you know, while you were doing your econ PhD,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:15.680
[Amit Varma]: it struck me that he was, you know, almost the last intellectual of a certain kind, in

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.760
[Amit Varma]: the sense that he straddled all these disciplines, you know, Milton Friedman called him, quote,

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.400
[Amit Varma]: the greatest social scientist who has lived in work, but stop quote, and Justin Wolfers

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.320
[Amit Varma]: called him the most important social scientist in the last 50 years. And it struck me that

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:36.200
[Amit Varma]: in that sense, he was almost like a 19th century intellectual, that he wasn't bound by a specialization,

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:41.480
[Amit Varma]: that he was, you know, delving into all these different disciplines, not just economics,

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.560
[Amit Varma]: but also sociology, racial discrimination, crime, just a few days ago, I was reading

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.320
[Amit Varma]: his work on rational addiction. And it's just fascinating work. And it sort of comes from

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:56.040
[Amit Varma]: that classic impulse to try and understand human nature. And it seems to me that when

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.840
[Amit Varma]: I look upon your arc, and your interest in the variety of things that you've done, was

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.240
[Amit Varma]: he a direct influence in that sense,

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.200
[Guest]: it would be hard to understate how important Gary was, in the way we thought about the

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:14.400
[Guest]: world. So, you know, we had a set of tools, so some basic economic models, and some techniques,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.040
[Guest]: some framework for the world. And we were taught to think about everything that way.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.160
[Guest]: So, you know, for me, the first approach is to think about how judges behaved,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.880
[Guest]: which I'll explain in a second, because I eventually turned to law soon after where

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:34.000
[Guest]: I left off, but, you know, thought about how judges behaved, how people answered surveys,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.560
[Guest]: how clinical trials functioned, almost everything I thought of, I thought through an economic

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.600
[Guest]: lens. And the reason was, was Gary said that you should, and that it was fruitful to do

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.320
[Guest]: so. And he demonstrated it in terms of, you know, you've mentioned crime, we could talk

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.600
[Guest]: family, we could talk addiction, we could talk advertising, you name the topic, and

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.240
[Guest]: he's thought about it. And he wasn't alone, by the way, there was a foundation there,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.760
[Guest]: you know, before then, you had, you know, Milton Friedman talking about the draft, you

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.760
[Guest]: know, obviously, then more classic subjects, but there's a wide range. So there's this

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:14.400
[Guest]: notion of, I mean, not in an aggressive way, but that economics should be hegemonic in

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.720
[Guest]: the sense that it should go to other fields, and try to introduce mathematical modeling.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:24.880
[Guest]: And now, you know, that's kind of, I think, back then, when I say back then, I mean, prior

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:30.280
[Guest]: to the 1990s, I think that was extremely radical. And in some sections, it is still radical,

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:35.620
[Guest]: but not really today. I mean, today, the idea that you would take applied math and apply

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:41.360
[Guest]: it to every single topic doesn't seem surprising. And this epidemic slash pandemic that we're

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.280
[Guest]: seeing now is a great example of this. If you think about epidemiology, there's the

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.540
[Guest]: non-technical shoe leather epidemiology of going to find the people that are infected

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:55.260
[Guest]: and then addressing that. And then there's the applied math version of it, which is SIR

00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:00.040
[Guest]: and more complicated models. And we are perfectly comfortable with that now. And I think that

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.360
[Guest]: part of that is, you know, the idea that you can use applied math tools and a structure

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.200
[Guest]: to address things. The only thing that economics really adds to that is to say, look, we shouldn't

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.720
[Guest]: just use math for biology or physics or chemistry. We should use math for human behavior. And

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:19.980
[Guest]: there's some simple ideas that can help you organize those mathematical theories to whatever

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.440
[Guest]: interaction humans have. And I think the ultimate example of that actually is people applying

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.840
[Guest]: it also to animals and animal behavior, which is another situation where it's just like,

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:34.240
[Guest]: look, every sort of interaction you can see in the world, regardless of what's doing the

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.640
[Guest]: interaction, there's a value to using applied math and some basic underlying principles

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.480
[Guest]: or axioms in order to organize that. And it's super helpful in terms of prediction, right?

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.320
[Guest]: It's really hard for me to understand how people behave until I have a framework to

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.480
[Guest]: think about it. And these tools that Gary had helped me think about that.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.520
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on to law now. What was your experience there? Like, you know, you clerked for Sandra

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:59.000
[Amit Varma]: Day O'Connor in the Supreme Court. And what was that journey like? What fascinated you

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.880
[Amit Varma]: about law? And were you sort of looking at the legal system through the tools of economics?

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:10.120
[Guest]: Yeah, so that was an interesting journey. So I think the initial interest in law was

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.640
[Guest]: not merely, I kind of understated my interest in law. So I initially said that I was interested

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.920
[Guest]: mainly because everybody else at Georgetown was applying to law. That's not entirely correct.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.040
[Guest]: If you, you know, debate in high school or college, you're going to think a lot about

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.920
[Guest]: politics. If you're a political science major, you're going to do it again. And a critical

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.160
[Guest]: component of political science is the law. And so there was an underlying interest in

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.800
[Guest]: the law. You know, when I first went to University of Chicago, I did my economics PhD course

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.080
[Guest]: work first, and I started to lose interest in law because I found the economics so new

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.840
[Guest]: and so fascinating. But while I was working with Jim Heckman, and not just as his TA,

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:49.560
[Guest]: but as research assistant, he introduced me to a gentleman named Richard Posner. I'd never

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.800
[Guest]: heard of Richard Posner before, which is probably more a sign of my lack of education than anything

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.800
[Guest]: else. Dick Posner was, at that time, a judge, also a lecturer at the University of Chicago

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:05.460
[Guest]: Law School, one of the founders of the law and economics movement, along with folks like

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:10.880
[Guest]: Becker and Aaron Director, and Ronald Coase, who was also there at the time. And he and

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:16.880
[Guest]: I hit it off. And we wanted to work together, either as RAs or as co-authors. But at the

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.960
[Guest]: time, I was working for Jim Heckman. And Jim is notorious, both in terms of number of hours

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:27.320
[Guest]: you have to work, but also in not allowing you to do anything other than his work. But

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.840
[Guest]: he respected Dick Posner enough to let me switch jobs. So I went from an RA for Heckman

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:39.500
[Guest]: to an RA for Dick Posner. And anybody that's had an interaction with Posner, and that's

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:45.040
[Guest]: Eric's father, will find him fascinating. He's like Becker. He is extremely prolific,

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.880
[Guest]: likes to think about everything, and is very systematic in thinking about lots of things.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.760
[Guest]: I think a little bit more than Becker, he's willing to deviate from standard economic

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.760
[Guest]: models, especially as his career evolved. So it was very interesting to see that. And

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.880
[Guest]: I ended up being the kind of person that was defending the classic economic models, because

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.360
[Guest]: I was just a young student in economics at the time. And he was willing to push them

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.640
[Guest]: a little bit more. So we had some interactions. He convinced me to kind of resume my law education.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:16.800
[Guest]: So I turned to law school. And one thing I discovered was that law school is very hard,

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.200
[Guest]: but it's not nearly as hard as economics graduate school. This is going to tie back into the

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.280
[Guest]: Supreme Court in just a second. I found, I didn't tell a lot of people at this time,

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:30.920
[Guest]: but I found law to be a relief from economics in terms of how much less work it required

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:36.240
[Guest]: to succeed. It was hard nonetheless, but it just was much easier. And that showed in my

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:40.320
[Guest]: grades in economics grad school were fine, but my grades in law school were a little

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.360
[Guest]: bit better as a result of the change in intensity, which I found to be a little bit of a relief,

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:51.480
[Guest]: too. So that performance and my rapport that I had with some of the professors that I'd

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:57.920
[Guest]: met indirectly, so Dick Posner and Richard Epstein and some of the others, allowed me

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:03.240
[Guest]: to do well enough in law school to apply for clerkships. And I was able to secure a Supreme

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.760
[Guest]: Court clerkship. It's very interesting. You get these clerkships ahead of time. So I knew

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:12.780
[Guest]: by my third year that two years after graduation, I would be clerking for Justice O'Connor.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:17.240
[Guest]: In the interim, I was going to clerk for a person, a good friend named Stephen Williams,

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:22.760
[Guest]: who on the DC circuit in Washington, one of the main appellate courts. So that's how I

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:28.480
[Guest]: got the opportunity to clerk with Justice O'Connor. And that was an eye-opening experience

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:35.800
[Guest]: in the sense that it is the first time that I went from just writing papers that maybe

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.720
[Guest]: people would read or being an RA, in which case somebody else is writing the papers and

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:45.000
[Guest]: I was doing stuff in the background, to actually writing... It's actually the second year that

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.380
[Guest]: I was writing things of consequence. I would undersell it if I said I didn't have the same

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:55.680
[Guest]: experience my first year clerking at the DC circuit for Stephen Williams. That year, the

00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.000
[Guest]: year that I clerked for Stephen Williams, we had the Microsoft case. So this was the

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.400
[Guest]: big antitrust case in the year 2000 that showed up before the DC circuit. And there, I had

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.840
[Guest]: my first big practical introduction to antitrust and got to learn a little bit about the tech

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:17.300
[Guest]: industry, which had just had a crash or was in the midst of a crash. So that was my first

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.920
[Guest]: opportunity to do something of direct importance. But then, you know, there's always a layer

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.440
[Guest]: above the appellate court that was the Supreme Court that made the ultimate decisions aside

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.120
[Guest]: from say Congress and the president that would make these decisions. And so that was my first

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:36.560
[Guest]: chance to see that in action. And also to see the process, not just, you know, kind

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:41.640
[Guest]: of help make decisions, but see the process. And so I found that very insightful.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.800
[Amit Varma]: And were you thinking about a career in law at any point? Or in fact, to sort of rephrase

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:51.720
[Amit Varma]: that question, were you, as a person, were you driven by a sense of what you want to

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:57.960
[Amit Varma]: be like, I want to be X or Y or Z? Or were you more driven by problems that interested

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.600
[Amit Varma]: you that I want to solve this problem? For example, it was a you know, a problem that

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:07.520
[Amit Varma]: drove you to do your little test on mice when you were a kid. So were you driven more by

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.560
[Amit Varma]: problems? Or was there a sense of I want this to be my career? And I want this to be my

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.640
[Amit Varma]: path? How did you approach all of that? Because you left the law soon enough, and you kind

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.000
[Amit Varma]: of got back into, you know, academics and economics.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.720
[Guest]: I don't think I had a grand ambition to be anything in particular. I've noticed two things.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.000
[Guest]: One is I like shiny new objects. So if you present me with a new problem or a new thing

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.040
[Guest]: to think about, I'm always attracted and want to think about it. And probably have too much

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.280
[Guest]: of a tendency to drop what it is that I'm working on to think about that new, look at

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.480
[Guest]: that new shiny object and think about that new, new, interesting idea that you've got.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:49.040
[Guest]: The second thing I guess I had a sense of is trying to organize my way of thinking about

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.000
[Guest]: the world, which is to say not only do I want to think about your new object, but I want

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.760
[Guest]: to figure out how that relates to everything else that I've been thinking about. It's not

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:01.160
[Guest]: like I have some notebook with a grand theory of the world, but I feel this strong sense

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.760
[Guest]: of trying to make things consistent and rethink some of the old stuff in light of what I'm

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:10.000
[Guest]: learning about new stuff. And so that was part of it. That sense of wanting to understand

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.840
[Guest]: the world, I think, is what probably led me to academics. You know, I don't want to undersell

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.640
[Guest]: the idea that going to a school where people judged you by whether or not you became an

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.560
[Guest]: academic in particular. University of Chicago was really bad because the standard was not

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.480
[Guest]: only are you going to become an academic, but are you going to win the Nobel Prize?

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:30.480
[Guest]: You know, that kind of pushed you towards academics too. So I did think about law, and

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.480
[Guest]: I thought about law because along the way, when you go to law school, it's very practical.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:39.080
[Guest]: You know, you have to spend your summers, and I spent one summer only doing this, which

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.960
[Guest]: is working at a law firm. And I worked at two firms, and both of them were fantastic.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.560
[Guest]: I realized, I saw for the first time that outside of academia, there are some people

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.400
[Guest]: doing some very important things and that are incredibly smart. So I worked for a firm

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.760
[Guest]: called Wachtell Lipton, Rosen and Katz in New York, which is one of the premier M&A

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.920
[Guest]: firms, among other things in New York, and just met spectacularly smart people who were

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:08.040
[Guest]: intellectually curious, but at the same time were very practical. They were resolving matters,

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:13.160
[Guest]: both in court and M&A deals, for example. And then I went to a place called Kellogg

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.440
[Guest]: Huber Hanson Todd, I think that's what it was called back then. It might just be Kellogg

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:22.720
[Guest]: Huber now, in Washington, DC. And again, same experience, just really bright people. And

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.760
[Guest]: I met a gentleman named Peter Huber, and he was one of the founders of the firm. And he

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.880
[Guest]: actually was found very interesting because he both continued to write books and had a

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.880
[Guest]: practical consulting firm slash law firm. And so that's when I first entertained the

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:43.520
[Guest]: idea of being a lawyer. There's one other per name I should mention is Ken Feinberg

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:49.600
[Guest]: is a person that I met who had his own firm in DC and he played a really interesting role.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:54.320
[Guest]: He helped serve as kind of a private judge to resolve matters. So when you had like the

00:26:54.320 --> 00:27:00.560
[Guest]: Agent Orange Victims Fund, or I think he might have done the 9-11 Fund, he was the one that

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.880
[Guest]: would allocate money from the fund to different claimants. So that was also very interesting

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:09.320
[Guest]: because he was also very intellectual about it and thinking about how do we not just figure

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.160
[Guest]: out who was harmed, but practically how you allocate a limit out of resources across these

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:18.600
[Guest]: people and account for proof. So I think that that really kind of got me thinking that maybe

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.680
[Guest]: law is a real career. And I think I probably ended up in a law school first for two reasons.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:28.160
[Guest]: One was because it was a nice compromise between the two. It allowed me to see and respect

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:33.580
[Guest]: these individuals who were actually making, you know, kind of intellectual contributions

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:39.360
[Guest]: in a practical way in cases or in transactional matters, and at the same time keep a foothold

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.640
[Guest]: in academics. And one thing that people don't appreciate about law schools, especially modern

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:49.800
[Guest]: law schools, and maybe this is more so about kind of top-tier law schools, unfortunately,

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:55.560
[Guest]: is that they allowed you to think academically about a broad range of subjects. So you're

00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.280
[Guest]: supposed to think about law, but they didn't penalize you if you thought about non-law

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:06.800
[Guest]: topics. And so that was the other thing that I think led me back to, you know, law, and

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.560
[Guest]: in particular legal academia, at least to start my career. I think that answers your

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.560
[Amit Varma]: question.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And it's interesting that you should describe the very smart people you met in

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:19.560
[Amit Varma]: these law firms as intellectually curious and very practical, because that also sort

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.720
[Amit Varma]: of describes a lot of the, seems to describe to me at least a lot of the work that you

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:29.160
[Amit Varma]: went on to do specifically in health economics, you know, which kind of almost puts you, you

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.440
[Amit Varma]: know, a decade and a half before COVID, it's almost like you were on a trajectory to bring

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:38.160
[Amit Varma]: you where we are today. So what were the sort of problems that, the shiny new things as

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.640
[Amit Varma]: it were, that drew you towards health economics?

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:47.120
[Guest]: So again, you know, it's going to be individuals to start with. So just around the time Jim

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:52.040
[Guest]: Heckman had introduced me to Dick Posner, I started thinking about how judges behave.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:57.200
[Guest]: I also met this person named Tom Philipson, who's actually an important person in the

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.680
[Guest]: current context, because I think he's the head of the CEA, Council of Economic Advisors

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.240
[Guest]: for the U.S. President. And he was a health economist and had some really interesting

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:11.480
[Guest]: ideas. One of these ideas was that you could use economics to understand how people behave

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:17.240
[Guest]: during epidemics and how you can use economics to understand how people make decisions about

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.440
[Guest]: treatment for disease.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.080
[Guest]: So I began having conversations with him and he was, you know, he'd begun thinking about

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.840
[Guest]: this in the mid 1990s. So he'd already kind of had a head start in thinking about this,

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.920
[Guest]: but I thought it was fascinating. And so we talked about that, but the one idea that I

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:37.840
[Guest]: latched onto that led me to kind of embrace working with Thomas a bit more was that he

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:43.960
[Guest]: viewed, he had this concept called a data market. And the basic idea is that when you

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:48.080
[Guest]: do a survey, for example, for research, you want to do a survey to see who people are

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.600
[Guest]: going to vote for. You want to do a survey to see what income people have. You want to

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.920
[Guest]: do a survey to see, you know, how has COVID affected them. You have to think of it as

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:02.040
[Guest]: a labor market, or at least as a market where the respondents are supplying information

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:07.160
[Guest]: and the surveyors are demanding that information. And there's some trade and you have to think

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:11.320
[Guest]: about what the price of that trade is and what the quality of the supply is here at

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.320
[Guest]: information.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:17.460
[Guest]: And so that really started influencing me, made me think a lot differently or think very

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:21.320
[Guest]: differently about econometrics. Econometrics, we kind of took the data as given. We had

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:26.520
[Guest]: some discussion of selection obviously with Jim Heckman, but it made me think a little

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:32.400
[Guest]: bit more about whether or not we could use the idea of a market to improve statistical

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:39.120
[Guest]: inference from surveys. And so he and I wrote a paper together in 1999 about these and the

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.040
[Guest]: role that incentives play and how that changes the inferences that you'd make.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.520
[Guest]: But anyway, the main thing that I got from that was, you know, Tom was very much in the

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:55.440
[Guest]: mold of Gary and allowed me to kind of think in ways that I hadn't about data. So connecting

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.680
[Guest]: a lot of the work that Gary was doing with the work that Jim was doing. And I decided

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:05.000
[Guest]: I wanted to work with this person more. So we didn't initially work on epidemics. I got

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.040
[Guest]: to that a little bit later, but we did work on, you know, another very interesting aspect,

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.360
[Guest]: which is the idea of nonprofits. And this also started moving me towards health because

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:20.240
[Guest]: in the United States, about 60% of hospitals are nonprofit. More, I think, if you do it

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:28.600
[Guest]: by bed. But so we started thinking about why are some firms nonprofit, some firms for profit?

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:34.240
[Guest]: And why do firms decide to, you know, sometimes choose each of these two different forms?

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:40.240
[Guest]: Why do markets tolerate it in equilibrium? And why does it only happen in certain sectors

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.520
[Guest]: and not in other sectors? So we started thinking about that. And again, that got me thinking

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:49.000
[Guest]: more about health. And ultimately, when I was writing my dissertation, I think I was

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.720
[Guest]: able to put, you know, three of these influences all together in a way that's very, I'd like

00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:00.760
[Guest]: to think very Becker-esque. So I started just like many grad students at Chicago, I went

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:05.040
[Guest]: through many topics, and each of them were actually fine. So I had my first topic was

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.880
[Guest]: on how judges behave. The second topic was actually on whether or not this is the law

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:13.160
[Guest]: influence, whether or not the felony murder rule, which we can dive into if you want to,

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.040
[Guest]: but it's a very peculiar rule that says that if you, if somebody dies, while you're committing

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.800
[Guest]: a felony, you're liable for murder, even if you didn't intend it, whether or not that

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.120
[Guest]: rule actually works and deterred, it actually has very complex effects. And so that was

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:29.820
[Guest]: the second paper. But I rejected each of these papers. And the reason is because the standard

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.280
[Guest]: at Chicago was, are you going to write the thing that that is not only going to be published

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.480
[Guest]: in a top three or top five journal, but that's really going to, you know, kind of put you

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:42.280
[Guest]: on the map and put you on a track towards winning a big prize at the end of your career.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:47.360
[Guest]: And I didn't think either of those were that big, but then as soon as I was done clerking

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:52.160
[Guest]: and was turning back to finishing my dissertation, I decided to dump all that because I had this

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:59.160
[Guest]: idea one day as I was driving to the airport, which is to think about clinical trials. I

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.760
[Guest]: was thinking about clinical trials. I don't know why I was thinking about clinical trials,

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:08.240
[Guest]: but I had this thought. I found it interesting that some clinical trials treated more people

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.560
[Guest]: than other clinical trials. That is to say, some clinical trials, you know, you look at

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.080
[Guest]: one treatment and you put half the people in control and half the people in that one

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:20.440
[Guest]: treatment. And then other trials, you'd have two treatments you're looking at and a control

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:26.120
[Guest]: and you do one third in each. And I thought, well, that's really interesting because especially

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.360
[Guest]: if it's a blinded trial, you know, you're going to have this differences. You're going

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.960
[Guest]: to get the same treatment maybe if they're common treatments across the two trials, you're

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.520
[Guest]: going to have different beliefs about it. And then it occurred to me that there's this

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:44.600
[Guest]: concept I had read out about called the placebo effect, where your expectations about a drug

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:50.040
[Guest]: affect the outcomes that you have after consuming that drug. And this is just because I was

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:54.280
[Guest]: doing background research with Thomas on data markets, learning how clinical trials work.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.720
[Guest]: And it occurred to me that this is a really interesting opportunity to study placebo effects.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:05.440
[Guest]: So I wrote a paper very quickly on how you can compare outcomes across two trials that

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:11.800
[Guest]: are looking at at least one common treatment, but that have different allocations of patients

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.240
[Guest]: to treatment. So different fractions getting treated to test for placebo effects. I immediately

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:21.720
[Guest]: called up Thomas as soon as I stopped. This was, you know, probably like an hour drive

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.240
[Guest]: at the end. I called Thomas and said I had this idea. He immediately saw that it was

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:30.640
[Guest]: a great idea. And he said, call Gary. So I called Gary and he said, yeah, that's a fantastic

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.880
[Guest]: idea. You should write that paper. And so within three months, I wrote a dissertation

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:40.400
[Guest]: on placebo effects. And so I knew also that that was actually a significant paper because

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.240
[Guest]: here are two people that thought not just it was an okay paper, but it was a really

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.600
[Guest]: interesting paper. And so that's how I kind of locked it in for me that I cared about

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:55.200
[Guest]: health economics, which is, you know, I had the data market stuff. I had now this dissertation.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.520
[Guest]: So health economics was going to be an area I thought was going to be very interesting.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:03.240
[Amit Varma]: And so that's how I ended up back at health. And that's a good time to take a quick commercial

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:07.480
[Amit Varma]: break. We'll come back after the break and, you know, get up to speed with bringing you

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.480
[Amit Varma]: to the current COVID crisis. And then we'll talk about that in some detail. We'll be back

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:19.240
[Amit Varma]: in a minute. Okay. If you're listening to the scene in the unseen, it means you like

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.920
[Amit Varma]: listening to audio and you're thirsty for knowledge. That being the case, I'd urge you

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:29.160
[Amit Varma]: to check out Storytel, the sponsors of this episode. Storytel is an audio book platform

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:33.760
[Amit Varma]: that has a massive range of audio books from around the world. The international collection

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:38.400
[Amit Varma]: is stellar, but so is a local collection. They have a fantastic range of Marathi and

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.640
[Amit Varma]: Hindi audio books. What's more, I do a weekly podcast there called the book club with Amit

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:48.360
[Amit Varma]: Verma, in which I talk about one book every week, giving context, giving you a taste of

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:53.880
[Amit Varma]: it and so on. Download that app and listen to my show. And as long as Storytel sponsors

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:58.360
[Amit Varma]: this show within this commercial itself, I will recommend an audio book that I liked

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:04.920
[Amit Varma]: on that platform every week. My recommendation for this week is Mitro Marjani by Krishna

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:10.880
[Amit Varma]: Swapti. This examination of the unexpressed desires and sexuality of a married woman took

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:17.840
[Amit Varma]: Conservative India by storm when it was released in 1966. And it still sounds as fresh and

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:25.200
[Amit Varma]: relevant today in 2020. So do listen to it on Storytel. Mitro Marjani by Krishna Swapti.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:34.080
[Amit Varma]: Download the Storytel app or visit Storytel.com. Remember that Storytel with a single L. Storytel.com.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.760
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Anoop Malani. And we've just,

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:43.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, reached that stage of the career where he's become interested in health economics

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.880
[Amit Varma]: and we'll soon get to COVID. But before that, Anoop, I want to take you back to something

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:54.240
[Amit Varma]: you said at the start of the show, where you said that you had witnessed 9-11 up close.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.320
[Amit Varma]: And the tone of your voice gave away that it was something significant to you. So can

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.800
[Amit Varma]: you can you elaborate on that?

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:07.040
[Guest]: Yeah, so this was obviously September 2011. I had just started my job as a clerk for Justice

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.240
[Guest]: O'Connor at the Supreme Court. And everything was fine. You're just getting the hang of

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:14.520
[Guest]: things and all of a sudden, you know, one day we show up to work, we start pretty early

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:19.640
[Guest]: and then somebody runs into our office and says planes crashed into a New York skyscraper,

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.080
[Guest]: the World Trade Center. And, you know, everybody, just like everybody else, it was everybody

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.720
[Guest]: has their stories about 9-11. And, you know, at first, we were really worried. You know,

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.120
[Guest]: we thought that this was just a small plane. And then we saw the second plane. When you

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:35.160
[Guest]: see this happening in real time, you're obviously your skin tingles, your hair stand on end.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.080
[Guest]: This is a significant event, at least for those that were in America, seeing what's

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:44.440
[Guest]: happening. And then we'd heard that there was a plane that had landed to the west of

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.600
[Guest]: us. So I don't know if you know about the geography of Washington, D.C., but to the

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.040
[Guest]: west of the Supreme Court immediately is the Capitol. And then to the west of that is down

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.200
[Guest]: a ways a bit is the White House. And to the west of that, if you go a little bit further

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:01.040
[Guest]: across the river, is the Pentagon. We didn't know that the plane had crashed in the Pentagon.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.320
[Guest]: We saw smoke in the sky and thought the plane had landed in the White House, which really

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:11.000
[Guest]: kind of freaked us out. The place went on lockdown. The justices were evacuated. We

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.880
[Guest]: were has to leave the building. And all these men with guns came out. And so we ended up

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:23.280
[Guest]: watching with crowds in hastily opened restaurants and bars along Pennsylvania Avenue. At about

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.320
[Guest]: this time, it just occurred to me, you know, I was so worried about what was happening

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.120
[Guest]: there in D.C. I didn't realize my sister was actually in New York City. She was going to

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:37.200
[Guest]: med school there. And so I spent part of the day trying to find her and part of the day

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:43.480
[Guest]: trying to, you know, kind of get my bearings straight. And so that event, I think, allowed

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.120
[Guest]: me to see that these things that happen in the world that you hear about, I mean, it's

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:52.200
[Guest]: not the first major event that happens, that they happen to people and they're real events

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.480
[Guest]: and will have real impacts in a way that's not just a news story that you read about.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.040
[Guest]: So that was the first thing that I realized that these are significant events. And one

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.400
[Guest]: of the things that I noticed, and this would happen to me repeatedly because there were

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:10.640
[Guest]: other strangely terrorist events that we've been close to, meaning not a participant in,

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.720
[Guest]: to be clear, but just to like be adjacently affected. It made me realize that there are

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.440
[Guest]: kind of two ways to address this. You know, I'm simplifying greatly here is that there's

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.600
[Guest]: some of my colleagues who say like, oh, these events happen and then they go back to their

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.160
[Guest]: regular research. And some people say these are events that one ought to think about more

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:34.640
[Guest]: seriously and understand the impact of. And I noticed that I kind of had the latter reaction,

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:38.760
[Guest]: which is I wanted to understand these events. And one of the ways that we did it, that year

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:43.560
[Guest]: that we had 9-11, we actually had three major events at the Supreme Court related to D.C.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.800
[Guest]: One was obviously 9-11, which dwarfs all the others. But a second one was that we had a

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.240
[Guest]: series of anthrax threats and attacks against government offices, including the U.S. Supreme

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:57.120
[Guest]: Court just two months later. And then towards the end of that year, there was a sniper going

00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:03.040
[Guest]: around D.C. shooting people from a white van, everybody thought. And so I was interested

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:09.940
[Guest]: in that last episode, the D.C. sniper, people thought were targeting people at gas stations.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.800
[Guest]: And so people started avoiding gas stations. And so my immediate reaction was, well, I

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.080
[Guest]: wanted to kind of understand whether that was a rational reaction or not. And I wanted

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:23.120
[Guest]: to see if we could determine that by looking at where people went to go buy gas. And based

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:27.720
[Guest]: on that, kind of back out what their beliefs are about the threat. That is to say, how

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.240
[Guest]: much cost were they willing to undertake to go someplace else?

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:35.880
[Guest]: Now, that research topic crashed and burned because I couldn't get access to the gas data.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:40.640
[Guest]: But when these crises happened, I was interested in trying to understand those crises and not

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:45.600
[Guest]: so much try to, you know, kind of push them aside and go back to what I was doing before.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:51.440
[Guest]: I guess it was the shiny new object, but had more salience because it had affected me or

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:56.200
[Guest]: the location that I was in. And so that's how 9-11 kind of happened.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.760
[Guest]: The one other thing I'd say about 9-11 that was a little bit controversial, not controversial,

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:05.680
[Guest]: but I think is a bit different is I feel that when events like this happen, people kind

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:13.040
[Guest]: of rush to conclusions about what that event means and what to do in response or what not

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:17.640
[Guest]: to do in response. And I don't have that view. My view is that at the beginning, there's

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:23.320
[Guest]: just a ton of uncertainty and that one ought to entertain a wide range of views and potential

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:28.600
[Guest]: responses and discuss them before deciding on any particular one. That's kind of controversial

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.360
[Guest]: because, you know, the other thing I observed during this is that not only is there a lot

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:38.160
[Guest]: of uncertainty, but there's a ton of hurting, which is to say people kind of hurt around

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:43.000
[Guest]: particular conclusions about an event and rush to judgment based on that hurt.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.720
[Guest]: It's not irrational, by the way. And the reason I know that is because of an important paper

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:50.960
[Guest]: that Abhijit Banerjee wrote back in, I think, 1991-92 about hurting, that it can be quite

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:56.360
[Guest]: rational, but it could mean that people rationally rush to judgment and then the potential for

00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:00.800
[Guest]: mistakes could be high. And so at 9-11, I think the rush to judgment, which I think

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.760
[Guest]: in hindsight, we know was the conclusion that the right response was a military response

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:10.240
[Guest]: and that Iraq and Afghanistan ought to be the targets. We learn in hindsight that maybe

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:13.760
[Guest]: that might not be the right approach. It might have been much more costly than the event

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.640
[Guest]: itself, but there's that rush to judgment. And so I think we see the same sort of thing

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:26.880
[Guest]: with COVID. That same sort of dynamics play out a little bit. But we should heed the uncertainty.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:31.400
[Guest]: That's the other thing I learned, I think, from 9-11 and learning now from COVID.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:37.640
[Amit Varma]: And that also, you know, just thinking aloud, it seems to me that some of the response to

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:43.080
[Amit Varma]: 9-11 might have been dictated by the fact that the incentives on the politicians were

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:48.800
[Amit Varma]: to appear to do something about the problem, instead of, you know, taking their time and

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:53.240
[Amit Varma]: doing things which might, you know, make an impact, but are not that visible. Do you think

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:59.360
[Amit Varma]: that played a part then? And do you think that is also an issue now?

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.880
[Guest]: Yes. And in fact, that is a very important point. If we were to write a book about this,

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.920
[Guest]: I would say what you just said is a theorem, which is that politicians feel the need to

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.400
[Guest]: act and that causes people to act probably before the information warrants it. Let me

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:18.640
[Guest]: offer a corollary to that theorem, which is that people that are in the business or have

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:25.920
[Guest]: the jobs of gathering information to inform policymaking are influenced by what the politicians

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:31.860
[Guest]: want to hear or what the policy consequences are. They're influenced by that when they

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:35.720
[Guest]: decide to gather the information, interpret the information. What does that mean? That

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:41.520
[Guest]: means that, you know, these stories that we hear about intelligence agencies, you know,

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:47.080
[Guest]: feeling the pressure to find evidence of WMDs, weapons of mass destruction, after 9-11 in

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:52.160
[Guest]: Iraq felt like, you know, they had to provide more evidence in favour than against, regardless

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.360
[Guest]: of what the data actually said, because that's what the people higher up wanted to hear.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.720
[Guest]: And so you can imagine the same sort of incentives play out during COVID, which is depending

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:09.400
[Guest]: on whether or not your boss, which is your higher up in the bureaucracy, whatever government

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:14.200
[Guest]: you're in, do they want to hear that cases are high or cases are low, whether they want

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:19.500
[Guest]: to justify a lockdown or want to exit from a lockdown, that will influence what you report

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:24.560
[Guest]: to them. And what that means is that we may not always get the best information. And if

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.680
[Guest]: you want to be more sophisticated about it, it means that you have to account for the

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:34.000
[Guest]: incentives that the producers of information have when you interpret that information.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.680
[Guest]: So in some sense, it goes back to that data market concept. But it's an important, I think

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.680
[Amit Varma]: an important corollary to what you said.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:46.600
[Amit Varma]: And I was going to ask a question about incentives in the current case a little later on. But

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:51.080
[Amit Varma]: since we are on the subject, I'll just ask it now. And then we'll rewind and we'll sort

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:56.720
[Amit Varma]: of come back to health economics and your other work on pandemics, which is that, you

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:01.840
[Amit Varma]: know, when I think about what the incentives are for current governments, it strikes me

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:07.200
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, whatever option the state chooses now, the costs are seen immediately

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.400
[Amit Varma]: and the benefits are unseen.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:16.680
[Amit Varma]: So the incentives of politicians are to play it safe in specific ways. For example, if

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:22.480
[Amit Varma]: I look at Prime Minister Modi earlier, his incentive was very much towards calling the

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:26.880
[Amit Varma]: lockdown and, you know, playing it safe rather than have the deaths piled up because of the

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.200
[Amit Varma]: deaths piled up from COVID, that would be, you know, something that would be a visible

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:36.080
[Amit Varma]: problem, especially for governments, which are particularly concerned about optics, as

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:42.080
[Amit Varma]: is the case in India, where a lot of the sort of your incentive is towards controlling the

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.080
[Amit Varma]: optics.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:47.040
[Amit Varma]: And in a similar way, you have a situation today where, for example, I am, you know,

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm in Bombay, Uddhav Thackeray is the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. And there is a lot

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.520
[Amit Varma]: of pressure from the central government, you know, there's a narrative war that is happening,

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.880
[Amit Varma]: there is a theory that at some point, the central government wants to impose precedence

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:04.560
[Amit Varma]: rule because Uddhav Thackeray is not being able to control the pandemic here. And therefore,

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.800
[Amit Varma]: the incentive for Mr. Thackeray, whether or not he's responding to these incentives is

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:14.160
[Amit Varma]: a different matter. But the incentive on Mr. Thackeray would be to keep the numbers low.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:19.120
[Amit Varma]: And one way of doing this is by not testing enough. And in fact, on a daily basis, one

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:25.040
[Amit Varma]: hears horror stories locally, of people who have had symptoms for 10 days, 12 days, and

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:29.720
[Amit Varma]: they go to hospitals and the hospitals refuse to even test them. So suddenly, you have a

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:35.600
[Amit Varma]: situation where these optics matter. And these other political dynamics matter and pervert

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:41.520
[Amit Varma]: the incentives to an extent where the people in charge may not necessarily be taking the

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:46.280
[Amit Varma]: best decision. As someone who works closely with governments, have you found that to kind

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.280
[Amit Varma]: of be a worry?

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.240
[Guest]: I want to be very careful with my answer here, because I want to continue working with governments.

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:57.040
[Guest]: So let me try a different approach, which is going to stay what you state, but in a

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:03.800
[Guest]: more general way and oblique way, but then ultimately agree. So let me turn instead to

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:09.200
[Guest]: an idea from evolutionary biology, which is one of the things I like to, this is an example

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.120
[Guest]: I really wanted to show. I was very excited the first time I was able to tell my kids

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:18.400
[Guest]: this because I've been waiting until they were ready to absorb it. But in general, we

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:23.200
[Guest]: think that more information is better. We meaning humans, at least modern thinking humans

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:28.880
[Guest]: that have university education, we think more information is better. The reality is that

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:35.520
[Guest]: evolution doesn't see it that way. That when you compare species, species don't have an

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:40.560
[Guest]: unconditional incentive to obtain information and truthful information. They have only the

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:46.680
[Guest]: incentive to gather the information that enables them to survive. Okay. So for example, this

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:53.240
[Guest]: can explain the difference between, say, humans who rely on sight, feel, sound, versus say

00:47:53.240 --> 00:48:01.200
[Guest]: bats, who rely on sound primarily. And it's really, you obtain the information gathering

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:06.360
[Guest]: ability that's optimal for survival, not for truth. Okay. You don't gather all the information

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:10.000
[Guest]: that you want. So we talk about that in the context of evolutionary biology. Then I always

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.640
[Guest]: ask my kids like, so how does that affect other things and try to push them a little

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:19.400
[Guest]: bit like a law teacher might push their students. And I get them to see that that's everywhere,

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.800
[Guest]: that our incentives to gather information are a function of what the utility or the

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:26.880
[Guest]: value of the practical use of that information is going to be. But that that practical use

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:30.640
[Guest]: can also affect the way that we gather the information. So you're not always getting,

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:35.040
[Guest]: you know, quote unquote, unbiased information about the world. Now, bringing it back to

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:43.320
[Guest]: your topic, that same concept applies here, which is a government official, a politician

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.840
[Guest]: doesn't have an incentive to gather truth for the sake of truth, not only in the mundane

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:50.480
[Guest]: ways in the sense that, you know, information is costly. And so you need to economize on

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:56.560
[Guest]: on expending effort and resources on getting information, but also they might find that

00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.840
[Guest]: certain conclusions have different payoffs or different conclusions have different payoffs.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.320
[Guest]: So for example, in a democracy or in a place where public opinion matters, you know, what

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:11.780
[Guest]: the public thinks is important. So in that sense, when you're gathering information,

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:15.480
[Guest]: you're not really just trying to find an unbiased estimate of what's going on in the world,

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.720
[Guest]: whether it's the amount of COVID in the population, things like that. What you're really doing

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.880
[Guest]: is trying to solve a, you know, play a beauty contest. I don't know if you remember what

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:27.360
[Guest]: the standard beauty contest, the goal is, and sometimes stock markets are characterized

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.880
[Guest]: this way, the goal is, is to figure out what the price is that everybody else will want

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:36.560
[Guest]: to price the stock at, not so much what the underlying true value of the stock is. Okay.

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:44.800
[Guest]: And so that's the classic kind of beauty contest approach or structure for information acquisition,

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:48.120
[Guest]: if that makes sense. And so to some extent, I think that's what politicians are trying

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:55.720
[Guest]: to do. They're trying to figure out what is going to get the best reaction in the population.

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.920
[Guest]: And that's obviously going to be influenced by whether or not you are, you know, in a

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:04.320
[Guest]: lockdown now and think that what you want to do is keep that going for political reasons

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.200
[Guest]: or whether you're not in a lockdown, you want to get to a lockdown. I'm not going to pick

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:12.920
[Guest]: any leaders. I'm not going to pick out any leaders and point them out, but it's also

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:17.120
[Guest]: going to be the case that the dynamics between leaders really matters. So if you take one

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:21.020
[Guest]: position and somebody else takes another position, that's a political threat. What you'll want

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:27.040
[Guest]: to do is gather information that supports your views as opposed to that other opponent

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:32.000
[Guest]: in the political process. And so again, it's going to skew the information that is produced.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.720
[Guest]: Now, you know, in a best case scenario, what would happen is that the data would be all

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:40.280
[Guest]: out there, unvarnished, and then you would just have to make arguments. I think that's

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.440
[Guest]: the kind of the best case view of the world, you know, kind of the way that legal trials

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:48.480
[Guest]: operate, which is all the data is presented and the judge decides as between arguments

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:52.400
[Guest]: that are made by the plaintiffs and defendants. But the reality is you have to think about

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:57.600
[Guest]: the incentives to gather information and the way to mask that information. And I think,

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:02.240
[Guest]: you know, what I'm looking for, and I imagine the most sophisticated politicians do this,

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:06.240
[Guest]: is that they realize that when they want to make decisions, they want to consider not

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.920
[Guest]: only the political aspects, but they'd like to see all the information. And I imagine

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.260
[Guest]: the most sophisticated or I'd like to imagine the most sophisticated politicians understand

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:17.640
[Guest]: that their underlings have to be given incentives to provide all that information and not the

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.640
[Guest]: information that the underlings think the politician wants. And so that way the politician

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:26.080
[Guest]: can make the best judgment, whatever the reason, whether it's to compete in a political contest

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.720
[Guest]: or to do well by the population or both. So I guess the thing that interests me in this

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:36.400
[Guest]: context is not so much, you know, what information are we getting now, but as we look forward,

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:42.160
[Guest]: what kind of structure should we put into place so that despite these incentives, that

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.640
[Guest]: unvarnished information comes forward? Does that make sense?

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:50.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it makes absolute sense. In fact, you know, when I mentioned Modi and Uddhav Thackeray

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:54.880
[Amit Varma]: in my question, I did not intend to condemn them for the choices they may or may not be

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:59.280
[Amit Varma]: making. They are rational people responding to incentives. And I think what one needs

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:04.280
[Amit Varma]: to do is not blame individuals, but look at the system and the incentives the system provides.

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.720
[Amit Varma]: So I think the answers are structural. And when you mentioned the beauty contest, I immediately,

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:13.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, thought of the story of the two guys who are in a forest when a tiger spots

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:17.360
[Amit Varma]: them from a distance and starts running towards them. Have you heard that story?

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.160
[Guest]: Yeah, you just have to be faster than the other guy.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:24.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so they're both running and one of them as the other guy that you know, we are never

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.440
[Amit Varma]: going to outrun the tiger and the other guy says I don't have to outrun the tiger, I have

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:33.880
[Amit Varma]: to outrun you, which is the way those specific incentives are structured. And it also then

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:39.600
[Amit Varma]: strikes me that, you know, let's again sort of zoom back and come to maybe a decade before

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:44.920
[Amit Varma]: COVID strikes. And you know, everyone knows that there is a possibility of a pandemic

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:50.440
[Amit Varma]: like this happening. Everyone also knows that it's a very low probability event. Now the

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:56.200
[Amit Varma]: thing is, if there is a low probability event, which has a relatively high and visible cost

00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:01.280
[Amit Varma]: of prevention, you know, if it's really low probability, no matter how high the cost of

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:06.120
[Amit Varma]: the event might be, the temptation of the politician is always to avoid the cost of

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:10.480
[Amit Varma]: preventing it, because he can always be questioned on that. And that will, of course, carry an

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:16.400
[Amit Varma]: opportunity cost, whereas he could just spend his, you know, time and effort somewhere else,

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:21.920
[Amit Varma]: and not worry about the pandemic, in that sense, for countries which hadn't, you know,

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:26.640
[Amit Varma]: been exposed to this kind of a pandemic before. And of course, you know, Southeast Asia was

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:31.560
[Amit Varma]: better prepared, because they had been through, you know, other similar, much smaller pandemics.

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:36.720
[Amit Varma]: But for the rest of the world, is it then inevitable that they were going to be underprepared

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.840
[Guest]: when COVID came around?

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:45.840
[Guest]: The short answer is yes. And it was rational. So in the 2000s, in the first decade of this

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:51.960
[Guest]: century, I wrote a paper with a colleague of mine, Albert Choi, where the thing that

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.240
[Guest]: provoked it was this, exactly this dynamic, which is, you know, why weren't we prepared

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:59.680
[Guest]: for 9-11? Why weren't we prepared for global warming? Why weren't we prepared for whatever

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:03.000
[Guest]: it happened to be? And, you know, some crisis had happened, I forget what the triggering

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
[Guest]: event was, it might have been just 9-11 itself, but everybody was blaming the government.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000
[Guest]: And I thought, that's kind of silly, because, you know, it's rational for the government

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.200
[Guest]: not to act before a crisis in the following sense. If you survey the literature right

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:22.320
[Guest]: now, there are tons of warnings out there. Okay, there's warnings about global warming,

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:27.560
[Guest]: there's warnings about financial crises, there are warnings now about epidemics. The reality

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:31.280
[Guest]: is there's even more than that, there's warnings about the risk of asteroids, and so on and

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:37.960
[Guest]: so forth. And governments can't address every single problem. Okay, there's limited resources,

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:42.360
[Guest]: but they have to choose. And the problem is that you have experts in each of these areas

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:47.080
[Guest]: saying, mine is the most important crisis, or mine is the most significant crisis. And

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:51.520
[Guest]: the government doesn't know which expert is correct. So the challenge for the government

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.280
[Guest]: is to figure out how do you decide? Now, obviously, they're going to act on some things or another.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.720
[Guest]: So for example, you know, the personal relationship between an expert and a politician might cause

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.200
[Guest]: that politician to weigh one expert's view a little bit more than the others. But in

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:07.320
[Guest]: general, or an expectation across these politicians, there's no particular thing that's going to

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:13.480
[Guest]: stand out that has a credible signal, except for one thing, which is a crisis. So when

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:19.200
[Guest]: there is a crisis, you know, terrorists crash in two towers in New York, and then the Pentagon,

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:24.920
[Guest]: or when, you know, actually the stock market crashes because of a, you know, subprime lending

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:30.160
[Guest]: in 2008, or when there's a actual disease that spreads, then politicians know they have

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:33.160
[Guest]: a credible signal that there's something very important, and that they have to take that

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:38.200
[Guest]: risk seriously. And that's a really kind of rational way to act, especially when it's

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:41.000
[Guest]: not just a one-time event that will never occur again, but it's an indicator of how

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.240
[Guest]: serious a class of threats is. So I think that, you know, 9-11 taught governments that

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:50.080
[Guest]: terrorism was something to take seriously. Whether or not it overreacted or underreacted,

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:53.560
[Guest]: that's a separate issue. That's where the theory of herds comes in. But that's one thing

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.960
[Guest]: that I think was the signal of credibility. The regulations that come after the 2008 crisis,

00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:02.500
[Guest]: I think is another example in the United States. And I think that after COVID, we'll be much

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:07.440
[Guest]: better prepared for COVID 2.0. And it's this sort of theory, I think, that can explain

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:12.400
[Guest]: why it is that East Asian countries, like Taiwan and Korea, et cetera, were better prepared

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:19.800
[Guest]: for COVID. And that's because they saw in 2003 SARS. And that event, that prior crisis,

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:23.320
[Guest]: which didn't hit all countries, but hit a subset of countries, kind of got them to see

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:28.240
[Guest]: that this is a credible risk. And countries that SARS did not hit, again, said there was

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.680
[Guest]: no crisis, so maybe this is not a credible hit. And so they didn't take as seriously

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:37.880
[Guest]: epidemic control. By the way, it also explains why it is perhaps why Kerala has done relatively

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:42.920
[Guest]: better than other states in COVID responses, because they saw the Nipah virus crisis. And

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:48.320
[Guest]: so they saw this as a real risk, and so we have to prepare for it. And so to some extent,

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:52.760
[Guest]: yes, Kerala did fantastic. But part of the success that Kerala had was that it had an

00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:57.720
[Guest]: early experience with the crisis, made it realize that this was something worth investing

00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.920
[Guest]: in, worth preparing for. So your theory is correct.

00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:05.320
[Amit Varma]: And would it also be fair to say, and again, this is a brief digression, but since you

00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.600
[Amit Varma]: brought Kerala up, that one of the factors would also have been that they have stronger

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:14.840
[Amit Varma]: systems of local governance. And a crisis like this really becomes difficult to control

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:19.920
[Amit Varma]: from the top down the further away you are, because your information is that much diffused

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:25.480
[Amit Varma]: and the incentives get messed up. So the more local the actual governance is, the better

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:29.720
[Amit Varma]: the flow of information, the better the incentives, and the more chances that you're going to

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.040
[Amit Varma]: handle something like this.

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:36.560
[Guest]: Yeah, I would say there's two components about Kerala. So I want to think a little bit more

00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:40.400
[Guest]: about the local, but let me go to the other one first and then come back to the local.

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:45.360
[Guest]: So one of the things I always found very interesting about Kerala, you know, there are various

00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:49.720
[Guest]: people that have made the argument, I think Amartya Sen has made this argument, and among

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:55.160
[Guest]: many others, that Kerala performs very well relative to other states in India. And the

00:57:55.160 --> 00:58:00.040
[Guest]: argument had been, you know, for some time, people thought that it was because the communist

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:05.960
[Guest]: government was doing a good job. I'm not entirely sure that's the case. I think Kerala was doing

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:09.720
[Guest]: well even before communists took over, if you look at historical data on literacy and

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:15.680
[Guest]: things like that. But I do want to give credit to the communist legacy a little bit. And

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.960
[Guest]: I want to tell you that there's costs and benefits and then get back to the local.

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:23.440
[Guest]: So the other state that comes to mind as I think about this is Vietnam. Vietnam has done

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:28.880
[Guest]: remarkably well if the data are taken at face value through this COVID crisis. And it's

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:32.240
[Guest]: not just in COVID, by the way, I have a separate line of research the last few years thinking

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:36.800
[Guest]: about slums. And Vietnam is very interesting too, because from what I can tell, not very

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:41.920
[Guest]: many slums, especially given its per capita income. And so one sense that I get is that

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:46.480
[Guest]: one of the things that communist governments do is build state capacity. And that is to

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:52.080
[Guest]: say build governments that are very capable of acting in whatever domain it is. And in

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:57.640
[Guest]: this context, there was a high return to having a lot of state capacity. And so that makes

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:01.480
[Guest]: me think that legacy of having a communist government in charge really built up the state

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:08.160
[Guest]: in a way that was helpful for COVID, both here and Vietnam. That would be my conjecture.

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:12.160
[Guest]: Now there are costs associated with that too. I don't recommend communism as a peacetime

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:16.480
[Guest]: government very much, actually not at all. And the reason is because I think that having

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.920
[Guest]: the government play a big role in peacetime means that you crowd out the private sector,

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:25.920
[Guest]: which in peacetime is, I think, a more effective method of providing goods and services to

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:29.960
[Guest]: the citizenry in peacetime. But certainly in crises, communist governments might have

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:34.440
[Guest]: an advantage worth investigating. So I think that's part of it.

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:39.240
[Guest]: Now in terms of the centralization versus decentralization, which is I think the point

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:43.400
[Guest]: that you were making initially, I'm not sure. I do think local governments have a strong

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:47.760
[Guest]: role to play. And having local state capacity, they have a strong role to play. But it's

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:53.840
[Guest]: also important to remember that there's a trade-off, which is the information on COVID

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:58.960
[Guest]: is global. That is to say you want to be informed about what's going on elsewhere, not just

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.680
[Guest]: what's going on locally in order to be able to make informed judgments. Then you want

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:08.160
[Guest]: to be able to act locally. So you want both local capacity, but a kind of a global awareness

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.400
[Guest]: of the risk to be effective. So I think the thing that makes this kind of interesting

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:17.920
[Guest]: from Kerala is they had a little bit of both. At a state level and maybe at a global level,

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.160
[Guest]: they seem to have, again, maybe I'm speaking prematurely, but they seem to have a sense

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:25.680
[Guest]: of the magnitude of the event. And they had the ability to think about it and act on it

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:34.080
[Guest]: at a local level. And to do so in a manner that wasn't, at least from an outside perspective,

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:39.880
[Guest]: wasn't as bogged down by political competition. So I think that's the other aspect of it.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:40.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:47.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And it's interesting. And just an aside, you know, how a pandemic can invert our sense

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.680
[Amit Varma]: of values where normally we know the damage that communism has done throughout the world

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.960
[Amit Varma]: in the 20th century, but suddenly in a pandemic, this aspect of communism comes to the rescue.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.440
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, I think all sane people would agree that urbanization and population density is

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:07.000
[Amit Varma]: a damn good thing. That's why, you know, the history of humanity is one of migration from

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.120
[Amit Varma]: rural areas to cities. But now that same population density is, you know, turning out to be a

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:20.320
[Amit Varma]: temporary curse while this pandemic rages. Let me kind of take you back, let's say, three

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:25.840
[Amit Varma]: months, you know, when people are just beginning to realize that COVID is something serious.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:30.040
[Amit Varma]: And at this point in time, and as you've spoken about at length, and we'll discuss, there

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:36.120
[Amit Varma]: isn't a binary between lockdown and no lockdown at all. There is a gradation of actions and

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:44.000
[Amit Varma]: conditions in between that we can start, you know, thinking about and measuring and working

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.640
[Amit Varma]: towards. But at the start before, you know, let's say in early March, when, especially

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:54.880
[Amit Varma]: in India, when people began to be aware of this, how do you look at the policy options

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.840
[Amit Varma]: before the policymakers before the governments, and it's easy to sort of, in hindsight, talk

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:05.200
[Amit Varma]: about all the mistakes that have been made, and many have been made. But what was your

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.440
[Amit Varma]: thinking at that point in time about how India should tackle it?

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:13.080
[Guest]: So the first thing that I thought was that we need more information. Now, we didn't have

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.560
[Guest]: a lot of information about what was going on. The information infrastructure was just

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.120
[Guest]: being built. But that was the first thing I thought. Then I thought, you know, until

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:27.160
[Guest]: we get the information ready, I can see the value of having a lockdown in the sense that

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:34.120
[Guest]: it would allow you to avoid an irretrievable loss. What do I mean by that? I mean that,

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.480
[Guest]: you know, just let's use the simple framework, which I actually don't think is wrong, that

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:44.240
[Guest]: there's really a choice between economic activity and deaths from COVID. And you don't know

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.440
[Guest]: what the magnitude of the deaths from COVID are. You kind of have a sense of what the

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:53.120
[Guest]: value of economic activity is. But there's a lot of variation in what the potential health

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.360
[Guest]: harms could be. And it's irretrievable in the sense that once somebody dies, you can't

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.960
[Guest]: bring them back. Now, I know as an economist, I can just put a dollar value on that. But

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.720
[Guest]: I want to understand that or appreciate that there is a kind of irretrievable loss to this,

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.560
[Guest]: or at least in the way that people think about this. In that context, you might want to be

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:14.160
[Guest]: particularly conservative at the beginning and try to do what is possible, maybe a temporary

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.720
[Guest]: lockdown in order to stop the spread of a potentially bad disease, focus really hard

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.840
[Guest]: on getting information about the nature of the disease, focusing not just what's going

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.120
[Guest]: on in India, but other places in the world. And on the basis of that information, make

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.480
[Guest]: a subsequent decision about whether or not to extend the lockdown or relax the lockdown

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:35.560
[Guest]: or do something else. That I thought was, you know, kind of seemed like a quick rational

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.720
[Guest]: response that you could have. The only thing that I would say there is that I thought that

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:45.200
[Guest]: the calculus was going to be different for the United States than for India for many

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.920
[Guest]: reasons. But the most important one is that the cost of a lockdown varies dramatically

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:53.760
[Guest]: across those two countries for two reasons. The first is you have a much lower income

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.720
[Guest]: population profile in India. A lockdown was going to affect the poor more than it was

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:03.840
[Guest]: going to affect the rich. You know, people that are on salaries can sit and take a few

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.080
[Guest]: weeks off work without really, you know, losing their income, or at least they have a savings

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.040
[Guest]: buffer, whereas people that are poor don't have those things. And so lockdown is going

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.800
[Guest]: to have a disproportionate effect on the poor, and India had a poor population. So that was

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.760
[Guest]: the first consideration. But the second thing, the reason I thought that lockdown was maybe

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:24.240
[Guest]: not as obviously an answer for India is that there's a difference in state capacity. So

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.400
[Guest]: the United States has a pretty good capacity to enforce a lockdown, notwithstanding the

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:35.240
[Guest]: riots we're seeing as a result of the police brutality against George Floyd in Minneapolis.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.800
[Guest]: In general, the United States has a lot of state capacity to enforce this lockdown. I

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.880
[Guest]: was worried a little bit about India's capacity to do so. I have to say that I was actually

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:44.760
[Guest]: kind of surprised and it forced me to come up with a theory for how India was able to

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:48.560
[Guest]: enforce one of the strictest lockdowns. I think I have one, but it did tell me that

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:53.480
[Guest]: it couldn't last for a long time. It would just be harder as people chafed. And so that

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.960
[Guest]: would be the reason why I would think that while lockdown might be the right answer for

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:01.600
[Guest]: India, it would be a shorter duration lockdown than you'd see in other parts of the world.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.320
[Guest]: And I think that's been a source of tension. I mean, it's TBD to be determined whether

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:09.600
[Guest]: or not India's lockdown will actually be longer than other countries or not. I think that,

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.600
[Guest]: you know, we're seeing that after June 8th, there'll be a relaxation under the newest

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:18.440
[Guest]: MHA orders, although states are free to extend. And you're starting to see some relaxation

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:22.680
[Guest]: in the United States, especially in the South. But those are the two reasons why I think

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:28.160
[Guest]: a lockdown, A, I think lockdown is a good idea, but B, I think that lockdown probably

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.240
[Guest]: would have, I would have expected it to be shorter in India than elsewhere.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:36.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, we are recording this on May 31st, by the way, and the episode airs on June 7th.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:42.400
[Amit Varma]: So if many things have changed by then, don't blame Anupami. So, you know, you mentioned

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:47.120
[Amit Varma]: that you had a theory about how the lockdown in India would proceed. What was that?

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:52.400
[Guest]: Okay, so I think that if everything went well, meaning the government responded appropriately

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:56.440
[Guest]: in an idealized way, what would happen is you do a lockdown, you'd start gathering a

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.840
[Guest]: lot of information, you'd start preparing hospitals and things like that. So what does

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:04.840
[Guest]: that mean? That means you would use this opportunity to ramp up testing, to figure out what was

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.520
[Guest]: going on, to make sure that the lockdown was working, etc. And the second thing you do

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:14.040
[Guest]: is build out beds. That's really what this whole, you know, when people say flatten the

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:19.600
[Guest]: curve, you know, having, I'd worked with SIR models to some extent before this in a few

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:23.920
[Guest]: research papers. And so my sense was, you know, when you do a lockdown, you suppress

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.800
[Guest]: your transmissibility. That doesn't mean that unless your lockdown goes forever, it means

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.960
[Guest]: if you let up from the lockdown, the epidemic returns because your transmissibility rises

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:37.160
[Guest]: again. You're just delaying the kind of the jump in infections. The value of that is that

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:42.560
[Guest]: you prepare. So you make the, you do testing, so you know where to respond. But also importantly,

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:46.080
[Guest]: you build out beds so that the peak is not, while you might have the same number of infections,

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:51.640
[Guest]: the deaths from those infections would fall. And so that was the idealized response. So

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.920
[Guest]: that was part of the answer to your question. The other part that surprised me that India

01:06:54.920 --> 01:07:00.560
[Guest]: was able to sustain this lockdown for so long, even though it is known to have a very low

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:05.560
[Guest]: rate of police per capita, that is to say low administrative state capacity, was the

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:11.520
[Guest]: following, which is, it occurs to me that when you have very little police force, it's

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:15.800
[Guest]: actually easier to enforce a lockdown. And the reason why is because if you can get the

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:20.040
[Guest]: population to just kind of agree to a lockdown, like credibly, they stay home, then it's really

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:24.720
[Guest]: easy to find violators. Because if there's very few people on the streets, the few people

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:29.920
[Guest]: that you find, you can go after with a limited resource, a limited number of police officers.

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:35.100
[Guest]: That is to say, it's easy to detect violators with even a low police force in a lockdown.

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.640
[Guest]: It's when you get to that intermediate stage where you begin to relax your lockdown, that

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:46.080
[Guest]: I think India will have more challenges than, say, the United States. The reason is because

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:50.440
[Guest]: it's harder to find the violators of whatever rules that you have, as there are more people

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.720
[Guest]: that are actually out in the street and interacting. And that's going to quickly overwhelm the

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.240
[Guest]: police force in India. Whereas in the United States, you might actually be able to enforce

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.000
[Guest]: that. You not only have a better population monitoring infrastructure, but you also have

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.960
[Guest]: more police per capita. And so that's how I, at least that's tentatively where I stand

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:10.280
[Guest]: for trying to understand how India was able to have a very harsh lockdown with low police

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.600
[Guest]: force per capita. It also makes me a little bit pessimistic about the ability to some

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:20.400
[Guest]: extent of doing more gradual measures. However, to me, I see that as a challenge. The challenge

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:26.260
[Guest]: that I get from that is how do you devise enforceable gradual social distancing as opposed

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:30.600
[Guest]: to complete social distancing under a lockdown? And as Jude mentioned earlier, my view is

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:35.520
[Guest]: that gradual social distancing or moderate amounts, especially targeted, is going to

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:40.680
[Guest]: be better for achieving the proper balance between economic activity on the one hand

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.120
[Guest]: and controlling infections and deaths on the other hand, both of which are, I think, very

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.120
[Guest]: important values.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.660
[Amit Varma]: That's a profound insight. And I have three related thoughts before I sort of ask you

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:55.720
[Amit Varma]: further questions about, you know, the different gradations of social distancing. One of the

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:59.600
[Amit Varma]: papers I'm going to link from the show notes is the paper you wrote in the Journal of Development

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.280
[Amit Varma]: Economics with a couple of co authors called learning during a crisis, a SARS epidemic

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:08.360
[Amit Varma]: in Taiwan, where you speak about exactly this aspect of how the people themselves, even

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:14.880
[Amit Varma]: though there were very few cases of SARS, the people themselves started avoiding public

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.800
[Amit Varma]: places and restaurants and malls and all of that. And gradually, the pandemic everyone

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:25.560
[Amit Varma]: was scared of just petered out and you refer to how an informational cascade can play a

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:30.880
[Amit Varma]: part in determining mass behavior where they can overreact in one direction or the other.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:36.920
[Amit Varma]: And it seems that those kinds of informational cascades probably did lead to more people

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:40.960
[Amit Varma]: staying at home during the initial part of the lockdown. So you're right that even though

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:45.560
[Amit Varma]: we have less police per capita, they would have had less policing to do because it'd

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:50.640
[Amit Varma]: be fewer breakers of the law. That's quite fascinating to me. My other sort of thought

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.640
[Amit Varma]: was and I discussed this in an episode I linked from the show notes, which I did with Shruti

01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:02.560
[Amit Varma]: Rajagopalan on COVID, where she sort of spoke about how the cost of not having a lockdown

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:06.960
[Amit Varma]: would have been disproportionately on the poor, and the cost of the lockdown are also

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:11.720
[Amit Varma]: on the poor. Now the thing is, the thought that this brings me to is that unfortunately,

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:18.080
[Amit Varma]: in India, the poor are invisible. And therefore, when I go back to the incentives of the powers

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:25.920
[Amit Varma]: that be, I see two things. Number one is that the costs of the lockdown are less visible

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:31.660
[Amit Varma]: than they would be if the pandemic was allowed to rage. And therefore, it is sort of easy

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:36.920
[Amit Varma]: for them to build narratives that completely ignore that and say that no, we'll keep the

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:40.880
[Amit Varma]: lockdown going and we'll keep the numbers down because the other consequences that if

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:44.940
[Amit Varma]: they remove the lockdown and the numbers go up drastically, they'll be blamed for it.

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:50.880
[Amit Varma]: It is safer to continue the lockdown as it is. And the other aspect of this is that therefore,

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:56.100
[Amit Varma]: even though we want more information, even though we want far more testing, their incentives

01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:00.800
[Amit Varma]: are actually to do less testing, because the less testing you do, the lower the numbers

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:07.200
[Amit Varma]: will be and the better the optics for you to make the case that hey, we did the lockdown

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:12.720
[Amit Varma]: and it worked. How do you sort of feel about, this might be repeating my earlier question

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:18.480
[Amit Varma]: about the incentives of politicians, but this seems almost an insurmountable problem to

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.680
[Amit Varma]: me when I think about it.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:25.320
[Guest]: Yeah, so you raised three very important questions. So the first is learning during a crisis.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:29.840
[Guest]: The second is about the impact on the poor. And the third is about testing rates. So let

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:33.760
[Guest]: me try to address those in turn. So first, let's start with the Journal of Development

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:39.840
[Guest]: Economics piece. So that was with Dan Bennett, among others, a colleague of mine at the Harris

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:47.560
[Guest]: School. And the interesting feature that we found in the SARS data coming out of Taiwan

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:52.480
[Guest]: was that even though this was a medical crisis, visits to hospitals fell dramatically. You

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:56.880
[Guest]: can see that in the claims data. And so then we tried to figure out what was going on.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:00.800
[Guest]: And what we kind of deciphered through looking at the data was that what had really happened

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.320
[Guest]: was that people were worried that they were going to get infected by going to the hospital.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:10.000
[Guest]: So they avoided hospitals. And paradoxically, that actually helped control the epidemic

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.160
[Guest]: because you had one less area where you were congregating. And one could make the argument

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:20.480
[Guest]: that hospitals actually were a vector for transmission of SARS. And we speculated that

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:26.960
[Guest]: this might actually have slowed down the progression of SARS. But I want to stress two things about

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:32.200
[Guest]: this paper that I think are interesting here. First is just a little bit of academic history.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:37.160
[Guest]: So back in the 1990s, epidemiologists were already talking about SIR models. This has

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:42.880
[Guest]: been going on for decades, obviously, of disease, even diseases that afflicted humans. But they

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:48.720
[Guest]: never really explicitly modeled how humans reacted. And there are two scholars in parallel

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:53.320
[Guest]: that had introduced the concept of something called prevalence elasticity. One was Thomas

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:59.520
[Guest]: Philipson, who was on my dissertation committee with Gary Becker. And the other one was Michael

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:04.720
[Guest]: Kramer, who just won the Nobel Prize in economics. And they posited this idea that in the midst

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:09.320
[Guest]: of a crisis, that is to say in the midst of an epidemic or any disease, and they were

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:13.620
[Guest]: thinking about things like HIV, that people would take precautionary behavior on their

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:17.280
[Guest]: own in response to the level of risk. And when the level of risk was high, they do a

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:20.880
[Guest]: lot of it. And when the level of risk fell, they'd take more risk. People would do less

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:27.280
[Guest]: social distancing or other protective efforts. Now, what they hadn't thought about was how

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:32.320
[Guest]: people gauged that risk. Their assumption was people could immediately see what the

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:37.720
[Guest]: prevalence was, like the truth on prevalence, and then adjust their behavior. And so what

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:41.560
[Guest]: the JDE, the Journal of Development Economics paper, tried to do is think about, well, how

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:46.880
[Guest]: do people form those beliefs in the first place? And what we realized is they were not

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:50.920
[Guest]: looking at raw data. They were looking at, in addition to whatever data that might be

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.240
[Guest]: made available in the press or whatever, they were thinking about what their colleagues

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:58.400
[Guest]: were doing, what their neighbors were doing. And so you could get these big herding effects

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:04.600
[Guest]: where people really kind of strongly distanced themselves in response. So this ties back

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:08.520
[Guest]: into some of the work that Abhijit Banerjee did on herding. So that was the important

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:13.400
[Guest]: thing. It's important to remember how people learn about disease risk to understand how

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.920
[Guest]: they're going to voluntarily respond. So that was the first thing, I think, that came out

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.760
[Guest]: of that Journal of Development Economics paper that was interesting in this context. People

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:24.880
[Guest]: are learning about the crisis, and the amount of social distancing we'll see after the lockdown

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:29.640
[Guest]: ends will be a function of what they learn. Testing policy is going to be important, but

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:32.800
[Guest]: also what other people in the street are doing, what their neighbors are doing. And that's

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.760
[Guest]: a little bit harder to predict. The second thing that was really important that came

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:41.560
[Guest]: out of this was how to do cost-benefit analysis in this context. That is to say, you know,

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:45.040
[Guest]: the question you asked was, is a lockdown a good idea or not? And I think the initial

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.320
[Guest]: simple way that people thought about it was, well, you know, there's this tradeoff between

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:53.600
[Guest]: health and economic activity. And if you lockdown, you get health and you get less economic activity

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.720
[Guest]: and vice versa. And then there was this wave of belief that actually, no, no, no, that

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:03.080
[Guest]: if you release, you would get less economic activity, that the disease caused less economic

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:07.920
[Guest]: activity because people would voluntarily social distance even if there wasn't a lockdown.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:11.500
[Guest]: And I think that there's some truth to that as well, except I think you have to combine

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:18.200
[Guest]: both views to really understand what's going on. And then the Development Economics paper,

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:22.760
[Guest]: the SARS paper, I think helps me think about that a little bit. So I think the way to do

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:27.100
[Guest]: cost-benefit analysis in this context, that is to say, ask yourself, what is the impact

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:31.760
[Guest]: of COVID versus what's the impact of lockdown, is to understand the following. And I apologize

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:36.520
[Guest]: if this is a little bit a longer discourse, but I've been thinking a lot about it recently.

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:41.080
[Guest]: So think about the chain of causation that you've got going on here. You go from COVID

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:47.840
[Guest]: or the disease, the disease causes some policy changes, and then those policy changes cause

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:53.320
[Guest]: some outcome along with the disease. And so if you're trying to figure this out, you can

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.840
[Guest]: break that up into two parts, which is to say, first, think about what affect different

01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:00.440
[Guest]: policies, what the outcome would be in terms of number of, amount of disease, amount of

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:06.360
[Guest]: economic activity with and without a lockdown, let's say, just to be simplistic about it.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:12.240
[Guest]: And then think about what policies are caused by the disease. That is to say, given the

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:15.640
[Guest]: disease, what policy is the government going to pursue? And that's how you can figure out

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:19.800
[Guest]: what the impact of COVID is, separately from what the impact of the lockdown is. Does that

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:20.800
[Guest]: make sense before I proceed?

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:24.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that makes absolute sense. In fact, that was going to be my next sort of question

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.600
[Guest]: to you. So please go ahead. It's fascinating.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.320
[Guest]: Yeah. So this is what, and I'm teaching a development economics class, actually just

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.920
[Guest]: finished teaching development economics. We did a little segment on this. And this is

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:37.920
[Guest]: this is kind of the way that I described it to students as well. So let's take the second

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:42.200
[Guest]: part of that step, which is, you know, what is the effect of policy on outcomes? And imagine

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:47.480
[Guest]: that there's two policies out there, lockdown or no lockdown, just for simplicity. And then

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:53.840
[Guest]: think about two types of outcomes, people dying from the disease and economic activity.

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.440
[Guest]: Okay. The important thing to remember is that when you have a lockdown, you have a mandatory

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:05.120
[Guest]: social distancing that will, let's just for simplicity say that non-pharmaceutical interventions

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.800
[Guest]: like a lockdown actually reduce disease. This should reduce the disease, but it will also

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:15.360
[Guest]: reduce your economic activity. If you don't do a lockdown, you will still have some distancing,

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:19.160
[Guest]: but it will be voluntary. People will decide what distancing do on their own. We call this

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:22.760
[Guest]: voluntary social distancing. So you'll have some voluntary social distancing, which will

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:28.160
[Guest]: also have these effects of lowering the number of cases and also decreasing economic activity.

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:32.640
[Guest]: And the real question is whether or not you will have more social distancing with voluntary

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:37.840
[Guest]: social distancing or with mandatory social distancing. And if you think that it's going

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:42.000
[Guest]: to be more with mandatory social distancing, then you're in the standard framework that

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.200
[Guest]: people initially had, which is the lockdown will cause more distancing, which will reduce

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:51.120
[Guest]: the disease, but also reduce economic activity more. Alternatively, if you think it's the

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:54.480
[Guest]: other way around, if you think voluntary social distancing will cause more, then you'll have

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:58.800
[Guest]: the opposite view. And ordinarily, you would think that mandatory social distancing is

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:03.480
[Guest]: more significant than voluntary social distancing, but that's not obviously the case. And the

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:08.680
[Guest]: evidence for this is actually Sweden, which has pursued a voluntary social distancing policy

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:13.280
[Guest]: and has seen remarkable reduction, not just in cases. I don't want to get into a debate

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.840
[Guest]: about Sweden, but they've seen a remarkable reduction in cases, but importantly, relative

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:21.760
[Guest]: to say the alternative modelling prediction, but importantly, they've seen a big reduction

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:26.400
[Guest]: in economic activity, suggesting that it's theoretically possible that voluntary social

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.400
[Guest]: distancing does more than mandatory. I don't want to extrapolate from Sweden because not

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:34.560
[Guest]: all societies are like Sweden. My kind of prior view is the mandatory social distancing

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:39.760
[Guest]: will actually achieve more social distancing than voluntary. And so I think that the classic

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:45.680
[Guest]: framing, which is that you get more disease reduction, but also more reduction in economic

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:51.120
[Guest]: activity with mandatory social distancing than voluntary is true. That is, I think the

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:55.480
[Guest]: right framework, although the degree of benefit might be smaller because in the counterfactual,

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:59.160
[Guest]: you would get some voluntary social distancing. So that's the first thing, the conclusion

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:05.200
[Guest]: I kind of came to. The second one, though, I came to is it took me back to Hayek, actually.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:09.240
[Guest]: So one important difference between mandatory social distancing and voluntary social distancing

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:14.080
[Guest]: is that mandatory social distancing is coordinated, in this case, by the government. And the question

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:20.360
[Guest]: is, is coordinated social distancing better than uncoordinated kind of free-for-all voluntary

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.520
[Guest]: social distancing? Now, ordinarily, you'd want to say the answer is yes, but I want

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:29.880
[Guest]: to think a little bit more seriously about this. And so what I suggest is thinking about

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:34.600
[Guest]: cabining the different costs and benefits of social distancing at the individual level.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.560
[Guest]: So when I'm deciding whether or not to socially distance, or I'm thinking about the costs

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:42.600
[Guest]: and benefits of social distancing to myself or in my vicinity, I think about the following.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:46.640
[Guest]: Obviously, there's some private benefits. I've reduced my risk of infection. There are

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:52.120
[Guest]: some private costs. When I distance, I can't go shopping or go to work. And so that's a

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:56.600
[Guest]: cost. It might lower income. It might lower my consumption. But there's also a non-private

01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:01.280
[Guest]: component of it in my immediate vicinity, which is the externalities I have. So when

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:07.920
[Guest]: I go out and don't socially distance, I might risk spreading the infection. And it's also

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:12.840
[Guest]: the case, though, that when I don't go out, I won't provide demand for the marketplace.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:17.240
[Guest]: So I'm going to affect other people's incomes. Okay? So there are personal costs and benefits

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:22.800
[Guest]: to myself. And then there's these external costs and benefits of engaging with the world

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:29.000
[Guest]: or not. Now, the way that I think about this, and this is very much in a kind of a Hayekian

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:34.440
[Guest]: view of the world, is that I probably have better information about the costs and benefits

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:39.880
[Guest]: to myself, particularly for the economic benefits, and especially when there's a lot of heterogeneity.

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:42.960
[Guest]: Some people benefit a lot more. So if you're a salaried worker, the benefit's smaller than

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:48.440
[Guest]: if you're a daily or hourly worker. But society might have better information on the externalities.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:51.680
[Guest]: And more importantly, they might do a better job of—or have better incentives. When I

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.760
[Guest]: say society, I mean government. They might have better incentive to account for the externalities.

01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:01.200
[Guest]: Okay? And so when you're trying to decide whether or not I want uncoordinated social

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.340
[Guest]: distancing, voluntary social distancing, or mandatory, you're really making a decision

01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:08.960
[Guest]: about whether or not you think that the private—the heterogeneity in private benefits and costs

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:14.680
[Guest]: are bigger than the social externalities. Okay? If you think externalities are more

01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:17.920
[Guest]: important and that the government has more information about that, you want the mandatory.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.660
[Guest]: If you think the private heterogeneity is more important, you want the voluntary social

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:25.480
[Guest]: distancing. Okay? And I think that's how you—that's the second important component of thinking

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:30.560
[Guest]: about whether or not it's better to do lockdown versus rely on voluntary social distancing.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.040
[Guest]: Okay? So now you've got, you know, kind of the two important things to think about when

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:37.480
[Guest]: deciding whether or not you think lockdowns are going to—you know, what effect the lockdowns

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:43.120
[Guest]: are going to have on both cases and economic activity, and which is better from a welfare

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:47.600
[Guest]: perspective. Once you have that, that tells you normatively whether you should support

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.840
[Guest]: a lockdown or not. And again, I'm simplifying lockdown versus no lockdown. Obviously, you

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:54.440
[Guest]: can do graduated measures as well. But then in order to figure out what the impact

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:59.840
[Guest]: of COVID is, I think people are a bit confused. What they need to think about is COVID not

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:04.040
[Guest]: only had an impact on deaths, but they also had an impact on policy, which then affects

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:08.480
[Guest]: those things. So the next step that you need to figure out is what is the likely impact

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.800
[Guest]: of COVID on policy choice by politicians? This really gets back to some of the original

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:18.200
[Guest]: questions that you had posed about how governments—what their incentives are. That's where that comes

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:23.560
[Guest]: in to play. So if you want to ask yourself the question, what is the impact of COVID?

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:27.880
[Guest]: You can't do that without thinking about what the impact is on policy. Policy is kind of

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:32.720
[Guest]: a—folded into that question. So that's, I think, where people are not thinking as

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:37.680
[Guest]: clearly as I would suggest about separating the idea of impact of COVID versus what is

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.640
[Guest]: the right policy. So that's how I would split that up. And the JDE paper kind of ties back

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:47.480
[Guest]: into this because it sheds light on the private voluntary social distancing aspect of it.

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.480
[Guest]: Let me pause there so that you can kind of provide feedback before I turn to the other

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.160
[Guest]: aspects of your question, which is the discussion you had with Shruti on poverty, which I think

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.080
[Guest]: is super important, and then the implications of low testing rates.

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:02.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, this is incredibly fascinating, and I'll take time to process it. But a few

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:07.320
[Amit Varma]: thoughts that come to mind. Number one, I'd say that, and I think you'd probably agree

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:12.760
[Amit Varma]: with, you know, that original sort of framing of the choice as lives versus livelihoods

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:17.000
[Amit Varma]: is a little simplistic, because no matter what choice you make, whether you have a lockdown

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.680
[Amit Varma]: or no lockdown, if we accept a binary of just those two options, you are going to affect

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:27.640
[Amit Varma]: both lives and livelihoods. My second sort of thought from there is that we will forever

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:32.400
[Amit Varma]: be in an epistemic fog. There is no, you know, as regards to costs and benefits, there's

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:38.480
[Amit Varma]: no way to really say how the counterfactuals would have turned out in the very long run.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:43.920
[Amit Varma]: And this is something that therefore will be sort of determined by whatever ideological

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:49.480
[Amit Varma]: proclivities one might already have, which, you know, and that brings about the curious

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:55.360
[Amit Varma]: situation where, you know, because Prime Minister Modi was for the lockdown, and President Trump

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.840
[Amit Varma]: was has sort of been speaking against it, that you have the left and the right on opposite

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:05.080
[Amit Varma]: sides of the debate in India and the US, where in India, the right wing is sending WhatsApp

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:11.240
[Amit Varma]: messages about how important lockdowns are. And it's the other way around over there.

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:16.480
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that this debate may never really be settled, because there is that epistemic

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:21.720
[Amit Varma]: fog and obviously, normatively, therefore, you and I would say that look, people have

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:28.040
[Amit Varma]: the best idea of the trade offs available to them, and let them make their own decisions.

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:33.360
[Amit Varma]: And you know, as in the case of Taiwan, you might find voluntary social distancing, actually,

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:37.320
[Amit Varma]: solving the problem if people are just allowed to make their own decisions. I mean, the counter

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.400
[Amit Varma]: to that, of course, would be what about the externalities, but as you pointed out, the

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:46.960
[Amit Varma]: externalities cut both ways, that if people don't socially distance, they are putting

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:52.480
[Amit Varma]: others at risk. But if they do socially distance, they are affecting the economy, the demand

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:58.600
[Amit Varma]: in the economy, and that will also take life somewhere down the line in unseen ways. So

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:03.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, I don't know what's the resolution of this? Because do you think that that epistemic

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:08.840
[Amit Varma]: fog can ever be lifted? Or would you agree that this is something that will be debated

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:13.840
[Amit Varma]: for decades about what was the right thing to do? And it will really depend on which

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:21.800
[Guest]: tribe you belong to. So I would say I'm somewhat optimistic, I'm cautiously optimistic. So

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:27.120
[Guest]: the first thing I'd say is, I believe that in a few years over the course of the next

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:32.200
[Guest]: few years, you will see more and more studies that more and more rigorously, although not

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:38.040
[Guest]: perfectly assess the causal impact of lockdowns. And obviously, you can't solve everything,

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:41.160
[Guest]: because you can't observe the alternative state of the world. It doesn't exist, which

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:44.800
[Guest]: is where we didn't do lockdown in India, or we released on different days in India, things

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:52.000
[Guest]: like that. But we will see a combination of epidemiologists and social scientists get

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.160
[Guest]: together and try to come up with counterfactuals. The only kind of pessimistic view I have is

01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:00.760
[Guest]: that, you know, I believe that the people that are going to write papers that suggest

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:05.040
[Guest]: that lockdown worked are people that had strong priors that lockdowns were good ideas, and

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.000
[Guest]: vice versa. But my hope is that by seeing papers on both sides of that, we'd be able

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:15.160
[Guest]: to get a better conclusion about what is likely the case. Although, I still think I agree

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.200
[Guest]: with you that there's going to be a lot of uncertainty about what's going on, but hopefully

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:23.600
[Guest]: we'll be a little bit more informed. I think the thing that is going to be a little bit

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:28.760
[Guest]: more complicated, which you also raised, which is this heterogeneity, I think that there

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:34.760
[Guest]: are different impacts on different people. That's an important component of this. And

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.880
[Guest]: that's true both on the disease spreading side. So we're finding out now that, you know,

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:41.160
[Guest]: maybe different people have different proclivity to spread the disease, either because they

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:45.800
[Guest]: have more or less contacts than other people do. But we're also finding those heterogeneous

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:50.680
[Guest]: impacts in terms of what the economic consequences are. So, you know, if you've got a good savings

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.280
[Guest]: buffer, you're going to be less affected than if you don't have as good savings buffer,

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:59.620
[Guest]: if you're salaried versus wage employee. And when we think about the impacts of these things,

01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:04.120
[Guest]: we have to understand, we have to appreciate that heterogeneity. That's becoming an important

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:09.480
[Guest]: part, a kind of a mainstream idea in econometrics these days. But we have to make sure that

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:13.320
[Guest]: we do that in policymaking as well. The reason why that's important is because it can lead

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:17.080
[Guest]: to a situation where we have COVID 2.0. I'm not making a prediction that we're going to

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:22.440
[Guest]: have it. But if we have COVID 2.0, we have to appreciate that even after learning, it's

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.960
[Guest]: possible that different governments are going to do different things, which brings us back

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:30.840
[Guest]: to your idea that the left and right are on opposite sides in India and the United States,

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:36.040
[Guest]: which by the way, incidentally, nicely ties in with your idea about political incentives

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:41.680
[Guest]: at the very start, which is, you know, very early on, there's some hurting that occurs

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.960
[Guest]: and the hurting doesn't necessarily always take you in favor of pro-lockdown or against

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.000
[Guest]: lockdown. But there's some sort of hurting occurs for each of the different groups. So

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.360
[Guest]: the right in the US might have heard it to no lockdown and the right in India might have

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:57.320
[Guest]: heard it to a lockdown. But then subsequent incentives are about sticking to your position.

01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.560
[Guest]: And that kind of affects your incentives to acquire information. In the future, I don't

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:05.800
[Guest]: expect that to be any different. I just expect it to be a little bit more informed. I think

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:10.840
[Guest]: the way that if I had my brothers or if I could, and I've been thinking increasingly

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:15.720
[Guest]: about this is what do we do when COVID 2.0 occurs? We don't want the same sort of hurting

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:19.800
[Guest]: to make a decision. Ideally, we'd like is the best possible information to inform the

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:23.220
[Guest]: decision making. There's going to be a political role in the sense that the politicians have

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:28.000
[Guest]: to decide what the balance is between economic activity and deaths. That's a philosophical

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:33.520
[Guest]: slash political issue. I don't think that that economists or social scientists necessarily

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:37.360
[Guest]: have the answer to that. But they should be able to say, given your the way that you're

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:41.560
[Guest]: making a tradeoff, given the way that a democratic society or government makes that tradeoffs,

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:44.600
[Guest]: what is the best way to achieve that? My hope is that there will be less hurting the next

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:50.400
[Guest]: time around. I think that's what you see in East Asia now, with COVID 1.0, given the SARS

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:54.240
[Guest]: experience. And my hope is that you'll see that again in the future for all the countries

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.240
[Guest]: of the world, including India.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:01.400
[Amit Varma]: Let's sort of move on to you know, the cost of the lockdown and how do we think moving

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:06.440
[Amit Varma]: forward like you've you've done some very thought provoking work on what you call adaptive

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:12.360
[Amit Varma]: controls, you know, which sort of goes against the notion that there is either a full lockdown

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:18.260
[Amit Varma]: or there is no lockdown, it's one or the other. And, you know, you have a notion of adaptive

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:23.280
[Amit Varma]: controls where number one, you argue that things should be done in a, you know, with

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:29.040
[Amit Varma]: gradations depending on how bad the situation is in different parts of the country and different

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:35.440
[Amit Varma]: parts of cities. And two, you argue that this kind of approach would actually be better

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:40.240
[Amit Varma]: than either approach keeping the full lockdown or removing the lockdown entirely. Can you

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.040
[Amit Varma]: elaborate a little bit on this?

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:48.520
[Guest]: Yes, we've been talking about this idea of a more gradual response to the crisis than

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:55.400
[Guest]: lockdowns. As I said before, I think that there is a strong argument for a lockdown

01:29:55.400 --> 01:30:00.920
[Guest]: at the beginning of a crisis, because you don't know what risk the disease poses and

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:05.040
[Guest]: you need a little bit of time to protect against the worst possible consequences, especially

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:11.140
[Guest]: high deaths and high death rates, and gather information. But once that's done, once you

01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:17.520
[Guest]: do that, you want to probably not use lockdowns as your strategy. You want to do something

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:22.120
[Guest]: that's a little bit more moderate. The reason for that is just because there's a high cost

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:26.480
[Guest]: to lockdowns. You're reducing economic activity and especially for the poor that can have

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:31.760
[Guest]: massive consequences. So you want to avoid those high costs of an extended lockdown.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.400
[Guest]: So what is a better approach? I think a good analogy for what a better approach would be

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:41.520
[Guest]: is the way that you drive a car. When you drive a car, you have two goals. I know you

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:46.400
[Guest]: have many goals, but two primary goals. One is you want to make sure that you're driving

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:49.880
[Guest]: within the speed limit at a reasonable speed. And the second thing is that you want to pay

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:53.920
[Guest]: attention to obstacles, whether it's a pothole in the road or a pedestrian running out, you

01:30:53.920 --> 01:31:00.240
[Guest]: want to be able to brake to avoid that. But when you do that response, you drive moderately.

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:03.560
[Guest]: When you're just trying to maintain the speed, you don't fully press on the accelerator for

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:07.080
[Guest]: an extended period and you don't fully press on the brakes for an extended period. You

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:12.800
[Guest]: try to maintain just a gentle adjustment of gas and brake to keep your speed target. And

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.660
[Guest]: then when you see an obstacle, that's when you brake, but you brake temporarily and then

01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:21.000
[Guest]: you resume your course. Now, the reason why it's a good analogy for the epidemic is that

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.120
[Guest]: you kind of want to do the same thing as you're going along with the epidemic. What your goal

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:30.240
[Guest]: is is not to just immediately stomp out the epidemic. That's very costly. What you want

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:34.880
[Guest]: to do is you want to maintain the reproductive ratio, reproductive rate, I should say, for

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:40.200
[Guest]: the epidemic that's below one, so that it's gradually being driven from society. And so

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:43.480
[Guest]: I think of that as kind of your speed goal. And every so often you're going to have these

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:46.560
[Guest]: outbreaks and in response to outbreaks, you need to contain them. That is to say, you

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:51.840
[Guest]: need to slam on the brakes. And in this analogy, the way to think about it is that social distancing

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:55.600
[Guest]: is like your brakes, allowing economic activity as your accelerator. And you want to avoid

01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:01.720
[Guest]: extremes except in rare cases, you want to modulate back and forth between the two. And

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:06.320
[Guest]: so that's kind of the intuition behind adaptive control. We just add a few other things for

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:11.120
[Guest]: adaptive control to make sense. The first one is that you have to choose your targets.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:15.840
[Guest]: So like the reproductive rate or the trajectory of death or what your bed capacity is relative

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:19.660
[Guest]: to hospitalizations. You figure out what your trigger is, and then you gradually respond

01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:25.000
[Guest]: to that trigger. That is to say, there's some mapping from what the data suggests COVID

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.880
[Guest]: is doing to your policies. But the policy response is gradual to avoid these extreme

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:35.360
[Guest]: cases. And the other thing that's important about this is keeping policy local. It goes

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:40.680
[Guest]: back to what you were saying about Kerala to some extent. The disease is infectious,

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:44.040
[Guest]: meaning they're going to be local clusters, unless you allow international travel or something

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:47.440
[Guest]: like that. But even then, it's going to be kind of local clusters. And so you'll want

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:52.640
[Guest]: to cordon off areas based upon those clusters and not stop all activity in society. So you

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:56.960
[Guest]: want to treat different areas differently. And so the way that we've been saying it is,

01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:03.320
[Guest]: to the extent that you can draw cordons around areas, say districts or blocks or even wards,

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:06.600
[Guest]: if you have the capacity to do that, by that I mean you can stop travel between the two

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:10.720
[Guest]: areas, any two areas, then you should treat those two areas differently and just monitor

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:15.520
[Guest]: COVID in those areas. And when COVID becomes severe, you tap on the brakes a little bit,

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:19.400
[Guest]: have more social distancing. And when COVID has subsided, you can allow more activity.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:22.840
[Guest]: And you just go back and forth that way with the goal of keeping the reproductive rate,

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:27.880
[Guest]: for example, below one. And over the course of a number of months, maybe six months, maybe

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:32.920
[Guest]: nine months, you'll be able to basically get back to the way things were before. In some

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:38.200
[Guest]: places much more quickly, in some places slowly. But this is a nice way to balance economic

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:43.000
[Guest]: activity with, it's a nice principled way to balance economic activity with infection

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:50.400
[Guest]: control. It's also really good when you don't have a lot of testing capacity, by the way,

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:54.440
[Guest]: or the ability to test, even if your labs could do all the tests, just that logistics,

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:58.680
[Guest]: you can't master them for logistical reasons or political reasons. And the reason is because

01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:03.080
[Guest]: you will still observe outbreaks, people showing up at hospitals or deaths. And so even without

01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:06.920
[Guest]: testing, you will see those events. And as long as you're doing things locally and can

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:10.960
[Guest]: cordon off areas, you can keep the outbreak from spreading. That's another big benefit

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:16.640
[Guest]: of adaptive control is that it accounts to some extent for inadequate or suboptimal levels

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:17.640
[Amit Varma]: of testing.

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:22.400
[Amit Varma]: So I have a follow up question. But before I get to that, let me kind of sum it up. So

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:28.160
[Amit Varma]: you can, you know, tell me if I sort of got it right. Essentially, what you're pointing

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:34.060
[Amit Varma]: out is that, you know, at whatever point a lockdown is completely removed, you're going

01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:38.640
[Amit Varma]: to have a massive spike in deaths, or a spike of a certain size. And there's going to be

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:42.400
[Amit Varma]: an overall number that's going to be quite high, whether you do it today, or whether

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:46.500
[Amit Varma]: you do it a month off, all you're doing with the lockdown is you're delaying that spike,

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:51.600
[Amit Varma]: but that spike is inevitable. However, what you're saying is that what you can do is if

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:57.400
[Amit Varma]: you gradually release it, you know, in a graded manner across different areas, depending on

01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:02.880
[Amit Varma]: local conditions, then you can control the overall number of deaths in the long run.

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:07.800
[Amit Varma]: And this is the best way to do it. Is that correct? Before I go on to my question?

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:12.760
[Guest]: That's exactly right. And then the other part of our answer is to build the tools that allow

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.240
[Guest]: each government to do that.

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:19.040
[Amit Varma]: Correct. Now, what I'm sort of thinking of is one, you spoke about the triggers. Now,

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:23.640
[Amit Varma]: it strikes me that whatever trigger you choose, let's say you choose the trigger of the reproductive

01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:28.320
[Amit Varma]: rate, which is how many people each infected person is passing it on to which you want

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:32.160
[Amit Varma]: to be less than one or whatever, you know, depending on what the metric is, you decide

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:36.960
[Amit Varma]: on what level of control and what level of social distancing you're going to enforce.

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:42.640
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, as we know, any metric that you come up with can easily be gamed. And

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:46.720
[Amit Varma]: especially when you consider the incentives of politicians, and you know, my listeners

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:51.240
[Amit Varma]: keep joking about how I only talk about incentives, but I've got to get back to it in this context,

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:55.280
[Amit Varma]: because the incentives of politicians will be to keep that number down. And there are

01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:01.320
[Amit Varma]: many ways to do this, such as by not testing enough. And in any case, we don't have adequate

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:05.480
[Amit Varma]: testing capacity, to the best of my understanding, even after, you know, a couple of months of

01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:12.080
[Amit Varma]: lockdown. And you know, the other part of this also is that at whatever, you know, different

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:17.680
[Amit Varma]: graded levels that you do, it does one really have the state capacity to sort of enforce

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:24.000
[Amit Varma]: that and what that also requires is that people higher up the chain of power have to then

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:30.760
[Amit Varma]: empower, you know, local authorities below them more than they would normally be comfortable

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:35.440
[Amit Varma]: to doing. So it seems that there is firstly a political economy problem here. And secondly,

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:39.760
[Amit Varma]: on the conceptual issue of look, whatever metric you choose as a trigger, it can be

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:44.640
[Amit Varma]: gamed. But are there triggers that can't be gamed? Are you looking at a combination of

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:49.600
[Amit Varma]: triggers like the amount of people who show up at hospitals, or just the overall death

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:55.720
[Amit Varma]: rate absent of cause, you know, and I'm just thinking aloud that when it comes to all these

01:36:55.720 --> 01:37:00.120
[Amit Varma]: little practical problems of who's going to enforce this stuff on the ground, and who's

01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:04.000
[Amit Varma]: going to take the decisions? How do you think about that? And it's a two part question.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.440
[Amit Varma]: One is how do you think about that? And two is you actually have a lot of experience of

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:13.400
[Amit Varma]: working with governments and advising governments. What's that experience been like?

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:19.360
[Guest]: Okay, so before I begin answering those two questions, let me just say that, in my opinion,

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:23.280
[Guest]: you can never talk enough about incentives. So you should just keep up with your approach

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:29.560
[Guest]: to that. I think incentives are critical to good policymaking. You have to make policy

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:34.040
[Guest]: in light of the incentives, the private incentives that people have to act. All right, so let's

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:38.520
[Guest]: now turn to these questions that you have. So the first thing I'll say is, when you set

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:44.400
[Guest]: targets for adaptive control, it is super important to think about setting targets that

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.120
[Guest]: are actually meaningful in terms of the information they're providing. So for example, if you

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:53.600
[Guest]: just set a reproductive rate target, as you said, reproductive rate is crudely estimated

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:58.700
[Guest]: by looking at the number of new cases minus the number of recovered cases minus the number

01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:02.800
[Guest]: of deaths, and you look at the trajectory of that from day to day, that's typically

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:07.520
[Guest]: how we calculate the reproductive rate without going into a lot of the details. Obviously,

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:12.400
[Guest]: the cases, the confirmed cases, that's manipulated by or affected by the testing rate. Not only

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:16.160
[Guest]: your testing rate per capita, but also who you're testing. You can test the people that

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:20.440
[Guest]: are high risk or low risk to manipulate that number. So you want to say, okay, well, I

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:23.800
[Guest]: got to be a little bit careful about this. How do I do it? One approach is to change

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:28.760
[Guest]: the trigger to something that's a little bit less easy to game. So look at just deaths.

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:33.400
[Guest]: So deaths can be hidden, but it's harder to hide than confirmed COVID cases. Obviously,

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:37.120
[Guest]: if there's COVID confirmed deaths, then obviously you still have the same testing issue, but

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.840
[Guest]: deaths might be less difficult to hide. So you might say, I want a different trigger,

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:48.280
[Guest]: which is deaths or trajectory of deaths. Alternatively, you can decide that you're going to modify

01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:53.240
[Guest]: your trigger and say, it's going to be a combination of your reproductive rate and your testing

01:38:53.240 --> 01:39:01.080
[Guest]: rate. So if your testing rate is very low, then I'm going to impose more social distancing,

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:05.000
[Guest]: independent of what the reproductive rate is. Or if you do a high testing rate, then

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.160
[Guest]: I'll focus on your reproductive rate. Okay? And that way you give people the incentives

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:14.640
[Guest]: to test. Now, obviously when you devise those rules, you need to think about two things.

01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:18.360
[Guest]: A, it's not just the testing rate, but who you're deciding to test. So testing policy

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:21.840
[Guest]: is important. This is something that people have been harping about since the beginning

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:25.400
[Guest]: of the crisis. It's important not just to test the people that show up at the hospital,

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:30.200
[Guest]: which are people that are already sick or test symptomatic people, which avoids the

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:33.840
[Guest]: asymptomatic people, but also to test the community. So you're getting both symptomatic

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:38.360
[Guest]: and asymptomatic and not people that are selected based upon the severity of their illness.

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:44.880
[Guest]: So that's one approach that you can take, which is focused on the quality of the testing.

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:48.800
[Guest]: The second approach you can take is just be more sophisticated in the way that you do

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:53.000
[Guest]: your analysis of the data. So this is another thing that we're thinking about. We don't

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.720
[Guest]: have a lot of community tests in India, virtually none, frankly, from what I can tell. But we

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:02.140
[Guest]: have a ton of data on tests already done and features about those tests and characteristic

01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:05.720
[Guest]: Indian government style. They gather actually a lot of data on whatever it is that they

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:12.480
[Guest]: do. If you can get access to those data, that is to say either academics or researchers

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:15.160
[Guest]: getting access to that data, or if you're a statistician sitting in the government,

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:19.160
[Guest]: the question is, what can you do with even that selected data?

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:22.400
[Guest]: If you know what the testing strategy is, we think that there might be ways to interpret

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:27.040
[Guest]: that data as well. And so that's another approach that you can take. You can either modify your

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:32.560
[Guest]: trigger to have better testing that's higher quality testing, or you could do more fancier

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:37.120
[Guest]: statistical footwork to try to make the best of whatever data is made available. So even

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.360
[Guest]: if people try to keep the testing rate low or select, maybe you can correct for it. So

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:44.620
[Guest]: that's the second way that you want to do. But you want to adjust your trigger to be

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:49.880
[Guest]: robust to the data that you get and issues with that data, including incentives to gather

01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:53.720
[Guest]: that data. So that's the way it works with triggers.

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:59.520
[Guest]: Now, the problem with that approach obviously is that's great in an ideal sense, setting

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:02.920
[Guest]: good triggers, but the same people that are going to make a decision about lockdown are

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:07.280
[Guest]: going to make a decision about adaptive control. And so if they have an incentive not to get

01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:10.640
[Guest]: accurate information, they're going to have an incentive to make sure that their adaptive

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:15.680
[Guest]: control triggers are also not getting accurate information. So that I think is the challenge

01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:19.840
[Guest]: with implementing adaptive control. And we're thinking about how to actually do that.

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:24.720
[Guest]: And that's a nice segue into your first question, as it turns out. Sorry for such a long prelude,

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:28.280
[Guest]: but it's about decision-making within the government. And you're right. I've spent some

01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:33.800
[Guest]: years working with different governments, either in a kind of adjacent to the research

01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:38.360
[Guest]: that I do, which is often on trying to understand the impact of different government programs

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:45.040
[Guest]: like Rasya Swasta Bhima Yojana, or other programs like Mission Kakhtiya, trying to work with

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:49.320
[Guest]: the government to evaluate those. You learn about what the government's decision-making

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:54.560
[Guest]: processes are, and you then can kind of get a sense of, they often ask you for help, and

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:56.920
[Guest]: you can get a sense of how they're making decisions and what they care about.

01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:00.340
[Guest]: And the other approach is through the, which you'd mentioned earlier, I have this program

01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:06.360
[Guest]: called the International Innovation Corps that sends people, graduates of Indian universities

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:10.880
[Guest]: or people that are working as consultants or programmers or engineers in India, to go

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:14.680
[Guest]: work, not just in the private sector, but to go work for the government on some government

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:18.880
[Guest]: program for one to three years to help implement it. We think that's a valuable tool for them

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:23.240
[Guest]: to see how the government functions and to improve, provide support to the government.

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:27.160
[Guest]: As part of that, we also get some purview into decision-making, not on the research

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:31.720
[Guest]: side, but the implementation side. And in that process, I've learned a few things.

01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:37.600
[Guest]: The first is, there are people that have, you know, people certainly respond to incentives,

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:41.480
[Guest]: political incentives, but at the same time, there are a lot of people in the government

01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:47.960
[Guest]: who really are just trying to make Indian society better. For those people, I think

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:53.720
[Guest]: it's better to think not in terms of politics as being the aim, but politics being a constraint.

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:58.680
[Guest]: And your goal should be, how do I help them make policy subject to political constraints?

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:03.360
[Guest]: Okay, not seeking the first best, but looking for the second best. And that's both in the

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:06.880
[Guest]: short run and in the long run, setting up structural features of decision-making that

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:12.480
[Guest]: enable them to have more latitude, more relaxed political constraints down the road. And a

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:18.480
[Guest]: lot of that is a function of, you know, building relationships over time. You help governments

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:22.520
[Guest]: for a little bit. You build individual relationships with particular bureaucrats, IS officers and

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:27.660
[Guest]: state officers. And then through that relationship, you build the trust that gets those people

01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:32.720
[Guest]: to listen to you a little bit more. So that's one approach that you can take. And the other

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:38.200
[Guest]: thing is to broadly help build an ecosystem where there are more officers like that. And

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:43.600
[Guest]: that's making, for example, investment in the training of bureaucrats. It's fostering

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:50.080
[Guest]: both a dialogue in academia and in the media where it's not immediately critical of the

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:53.600
[Guest]: government, but it's more understanding of what government constraints are. So there

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:58.200
[Guest]: can be a level of trust between bureaucrats more generally and people like us that are

01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:05.200
[Guest]: trying to discuss, critique, inform policy from the outside. And so I think that's another

01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:09.200
[Guest]: important lesson that I learned. This is a long process. I think we all have a role to

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:13.480
[Guest]: play, but it's important to remember that government bureaucrats have constraints and

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:17.720
[Guest]: we need to account for those constraints. So I think that's my answer to your decision-making.

01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:21.800
[Guest]: You're going to have to remind me of your second question though. It's been some time.

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:25.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, this was my second question. You answered the first question during what you called

01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:32.520
[Amit Varma]: your prelude to answering this question. But just a brief follow up on this. You were also

01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:37.080
[Amit Varma]: talking with governments now and advising them, right? So, you know, how receptive have

01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:42.520
[Amit Varma]: they been to your ideas of adaptive controls? Do they come to you with preconceived notions

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:47.680
[Amit Varma]: of what they already want and they want backup for that? Or are they also, you know, desperately

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:51.800
[Amit Varma]: trying to figure out what is the right thing to do and find a way to do it?

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:55.120
[Guest]: I think it's a mix. You know, usually when I have these conversations with governments,

01:44:55.120 --> 01:45:00.000
[Guest]: I don't come in knowing exactly what to do. Well, I always have a notion of what to do,

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.200
[Guest]: but I'm confident that I don't know the full answer. And the reason is because very often

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:08.500
[Guest]: in almost every conversation, I get new pieces of data from the government, whether it's

01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:14.520
[Guest]: facts on the ground shifted or whether it's the political constraints that are in operation.

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:18.560
[Guest]: By the way, political constraints are real reasons. I mean, I think it's naive to just

01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:23.160
[Guest]: ignore those issues. They are real constraints and they sometimes have rational bases as

01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:27.000
[Guest]: well. I mean, we're a democratic society. And so this is a side effect of a democratic

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:32.120
[Guest]: society. So I find that what typically happens is I have some notion. They give me some data.

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:38.880
[Guest]: I try in real time to see how my answer has to adapt to those realities that they're telling

01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:44.240
[Guest]: me. And if I can answer it right away, that's great. Otherwise, what I do is I say, you

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:47.880
[Guest]: know, I need to think about this. Give me a day to write you a one pager in response,

01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.360
[Guest]: which is very often my answer. And the key is just providing that back very quickly so

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:57.040
[Guest]: that we can set up for the next conversation. But yeah, that's typically the dynamic that

01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:00.880
[Guest]: we have. And I have to be honest, there's heterogeneity, but I will tell you there's

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:06.040
[Guest]: also selection. What do I mean by that? I mean, some bureaucrats are more open to outside

01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:11.960
[Guest]: advice. There are obviously differences in how much they are responding to private incentives

01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:16.800
[Guest]: versus social incentives to make Indian society better. I will not deny that. But I also have

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:20.240
[Guest]: to acknowledge that the folks that are willing to talk to me are probably going to be more

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:25.280
[Guest]: on the side of, you know, being responsive, being open to these ideas from the outside.

01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:28.560
[Guest]: And so I understand that I'm seeing a selective population. But based upon that selective

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:34.120
[Guest]: population, I'm actually, I think, more optimistic than a lot of my close friends are in this

01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:37.920
[Guest]: context, even though I know that it's a selective population. Does that make sense?

01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:41.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. And in fact, you seem very hopeful and optimistic, which

01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:46.680
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, maybe it's, you know, a result of my having just lived in India and lived

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:51.200
[Amit Varma]: in Bombay all this time that I sort of have this very dark negative view of government

01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:56.440
[Amit Varma]: and the way incentives function, but I'm hoping to learn that I'm wrong in some way or the

01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:03.640
[Amit Varma]: other. Let's turn to the economy now. I mean, there's no question that there has been devastation,

01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:08.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, whether it is because of the botching of the lockdown, or whether it is ultimately

01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:14.120
[Amit Varma]: because of COVID, which caused the lockdown to happen. Those are sort of separate debates.

01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:20.320
[Amit Varma]: And you know, they are intertwined. But one very interesting aspect of this devastation

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:25.280
[Amit Varma]: is what has happened to migrant workers, where, you know, 10s of 1000s of migrant workers

01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:31.040
[Amit Varma]: have left the cities and gone back, almost in a process of de urbanization. And what

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:36.880
[Amit Varma]: is especially tragic about it, what is heartbreaking about it is that many of these people from

01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:41.720
[Amit Varma]: the reports that we hear have completely lost faith. You know, there will be people for

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:45.760
[Amit Varma]: example, when the Bangalore lockdown was being lifted, and there were migrant workers on

01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:48.760
[Amit Varma]: the road who wanted to walk back to UP and they were asked, you know, why do you want

01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:52.880
[Amit Varma]: to walk back, the lockdowns lifted, your job will be back. And they said, No, no, we want

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:58.760
[Amit Varma]: to die at home. We've had enough of this. And there has been that deep loss of trust.

01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:04.040
[Amit Varma]: And the dehumanization that has taken place has possibly driven many of them away from

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:09.800
[Amit Varma]: the cities permanently in the sense that you hear people saying that no matter what happens,

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:15.560
[Amit Varma]: it's not about a livelihood anymore, we will not go back there. Now, this is, of course,

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:21.280
[Amit Varma]: just so disturbing at so many levels, at the humanitarian level, obviously, and and the

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:27.480
[Amit Varma]: deeper repercussions are that urbanization has always been an engine of growth, you know,

01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:31.480
[Amit Varma]: and there was a sense that India is urbanizing rapidly, and it's a good thing and people

01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:36.800
[Amit Varma]: are themselves making the choice to go to cities. And that's been the overwhelming sort

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.800
[Amit Varma]: of tide of movement from rural areas to cities, where they are part of these large economic

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:47.440
[Amit Varma]: networks, where, you know, they can contribute so much more and get so much more back. And

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:50.520
[Amit Varma]: now perhaps, I mean, I don't even know if it's the first time in history that it's happening

01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:54.760
[Amit Varma]: with at least in India for this short term, in the last couple of months, a movement has

01:48:54.760 --> 01:49:00.600
[Amit Varma]: been the other way. And it seems like it might not be a temporary thing. What are your feelings

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:05.280
[Amit Varma]: on this? Like, is it going to have long term consequences? And how should we deal with

01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:07.320
[Amit Varma]: that? How should we approach this?

01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:11.880
[Guest]: So I think that's a critical topic. But before I turn to that, I want to go back to to your

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:17.760
[Guest]: last question, just a little bit, actually, your prelude to this question, where you said

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:23.160
[Guest]: that I'm more optimistic than you are. And and that's because you're sitting in India.

01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:28.760
[Guest]: I think that's a really important point, actually. And and if you if you will indulge me, I want

01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:33.320
[Guest]: to go back and give you a little bit of history for myself to understand why I'm at where

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:38.280
[Guest]: I am. And I think where you are, why you are where you are, and like, what's the right

01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:39.280
[Guest]: balance?

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.280
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.840
[Guest]: So I'm more optimistic. That's correct. But I wasn't always more optimistic. When I was

01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:48.920
[Guest]: in college. One of the things that I wanted to do, you know, when I was growing up, I

01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:52.120
[Guest]: was always, we only went on vacation to one place, which is India, every two years, we'd

01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:55.840
[Guest]: go on a month long vacation to India, visit our relatives, and we wouldn't have a vacation

01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:01.480
[Guest]: in between. Then, you know, when I went off to college, I wasn't part of that process

01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:06.080
[Guest]: as much as anymore, I couldn't take up a month, but I decided to spend a summer working in

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:14.860
[Guest]: India for Mother Teresa at Asha Don in Mumbai. And during that time, I got to see poverty

01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:18.640
[Guest]: up close and personal in a way that I didn't even get to see when we were visiting family

01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:23.280
[Guest]: in India. We're not all prosperous in India, but but not to the extent that I saw when

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:27.960
[Guest]: I was in Mumbai, working at Asha Don. And I thought that it was very important to work

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:31.960
[Guest]: in India, and that you could do a lot more good there than than hanging out in the United

01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:37.040
[Guest]: States. But at the same time, I had an experience with just regular bureaucracy in India, whether

01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:42.320
[Guest]: it's taking money out of the bank, whether it's navigating traffic, or whether it's navigating

01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:46.440
[Guest]: the medical system for some of the some of the people that we saw there. This is also

01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:51.920
[Guest]: in the middle of the AIDS epidemic in India, too. So I saw a little bit about the way a

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:56.800
[Guest]: little bit had insight into how we were treating HIV and AIDS patients. And I became hugely

01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:03.440
[Guest]: pessimistic, hugely pessimistic, and then spent almost the next, you know, 15 years

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:12.040
[Guest]: avoiding India, focusing on the United States, maybe 20 years, 15. And it was only that distance

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:17.000
[Guest]: that allowed me to, you know, kind of forget, become less cynical, and reembrace with India.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.240
[Guest]: Now, I didn't, I still had that history. So I knew that it existed. And so I approached

01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:26.640
[Guest]: in a different way, which is I just lowered my expectations. And I forced myself to reassess

01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:30.780
[Guest]: what I should expect of India. It's also the case that I also stared at GDP growth rates

01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:35.360
[Guest]: in India, and per capita GDP and saw that India had made remarkable progress from say

01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:41.120
[Guest]: 85 to even 2005 to 2010. And that there was something significant going on in India. So

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:44.720
[Guest]: there was a lot of potential there. I think those two things brought me back and made

01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:50.240
[Guest]: me much more optimistic. Probably idiosyncratic, I had interaction with a number of positive

01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:55.760
[Guest]: with bureaucrats that really inspired me in Karnataka, and elsewhere, they kept me on

01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:59.360
[Guest]: this track. Obviously, I get disappointed as well. But because I think my expectations

01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:03.520
[Guest]: are a little bit different. And being able to go back and forth from India, to the United

01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:09.120
[Guest]: States helps renew that optimism. And one of the things I like to tell folks that are,

01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:11.520
[Guest]: you know, my colleagues in India that are a little bit more pessimistic is to understand

01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:15.000
[Guest]: that, you know, if you got deeply involved in American politics, you too would become

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.760
[Guest]: very cynical. And so India is not not always all that bad. It's good to sometimes step

01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:25.200
[Guest]: away. So anyway, that's, that's my kind of brief repost to the differences between us.

01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:29.360
[Guest]: So I would say Amit, next time, come on out to Chicago, I'll introduce you to some Chicago

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:34.600
[Guest]: politicians and then, you know, take a few weeks off. We'll be a little more closely

01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:40.440
[Guest]: aligned. So but anyway, back to migrants. So yeah, I share your concerns. I think I

01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:47.440
[Guest]: believe that urbanization is key driver growth in India. And that, you know, we see very

01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:52.560
[Guest]: few societies that are high income societies or a high fraction of their population is

01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:58.200
[Guest]: still engaging in agricultural labor. Yet we see that in India, it is unlikely to be

01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:02.920
[Guest]: the case that if India wants to be high income, that will continue. And that implies that

01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:07.000
[Guest]: people not only move out of agriculture, but very likely move into cities, which are responsible

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.740
[Guest]: for a disproportionate amount of India's growth. And I was very optimistic about that prior

01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:16.280
[Guest]: to COVID. And you know, my big concern was why don't more people move in? How do we make

01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:19.960
[Guest]: cities more accommodating? How do we build infrastructure in cities and things like that?

01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:26.160
[Guest]: COVID throws a wrench in all that. I think the lockdown in cities was hugely painful

01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:31.160
[Guest]: to not just migrant income, but broadly the poor in cities, especially the interruption

01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:38.360
[Guest]: of essential services. I also think that that in combination with the higher case load per

01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:44.880
[Guest]: capita and higher death toll per capita in cities, makes cities less hospitable. And

01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:48.920
[Guest]: the way that I think about it is, you know, I think of migrants as kind of the marginal

01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:52.560
[Guest]: movers to cities. That is to say, they're the last people in and they're the ones that

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:56.480
[Guest]: get the least benefit, but they are getting a benefit. So if you reduce the value of cities,

01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:00.520
[Guest]: those are the first people to leave because they're the ones that are made, you know,

01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:04.680
[Guest]: they go from being, you know, seeing cities as a small positive benefit to seeing cities

01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:10.080
[Guest]: as a negative as compared to people in the higher up on the income ladder. So it's not

01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:14.020
[Guest]: surprising to me that you're seeing these numbers of 7.5 million or 11 million people

01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:20.480
[Guest]: leaving cities to go back to their home state or to rural areas in the same state.

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:25.400
[Guest]: Now the real question is, is this a good thing or a bad thing? And what's likely to happen

01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:29.120
[Guest]: in the future and what can we do about it? I think that in the short run, you know, I

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:34.520
[Guest]: can see why people leave and why they're going back. It makes sense to me. The real challenge

01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:38.640
[Guest]: though is just, you know, how well will the states like UP, Bihar, et cetera, absorb these

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:43.760
[Guest]: people both in terms of COVID, are they able to effectively engage in quarantine of the

01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:48.680
[Guest]: high-risk individuals so that COVID doesn't spread in rural areas in those states? I think

01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:53.160
[Guest]: that's one of the big risks that we have right now with the return, very short-term risk

01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:58.060
[Guest]: from the migration. It's very much like the studies that it reminds me of is the early

01:54:58.060 --> 01:55:03.400
[Guest]: study done in the United States showing that before the lockdown, when COVID, we now know

01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:07.320
[Guest]: in hindsight, was really affecting New York City, before the lockdown happened there,

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:10.960
[Guest]: people fled New York City to other parts of the U.S. And now we realize that other parts

01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:14.800
[Guest]: of the U.S. that COVID that you see there can be, genomic analysis suggests that you

01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:19.160
[Guest]: can trace its ancestry back to the New York strains, meaning that the flight from New

01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:23.600
[Guest]: York is really what spread COVID around the country. And so I'm a little bit worried that

01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:27.240
[Guest]: that's going to happen now. The people in cities who are infected are going to go to

01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:32.040
[Guest]: rural areas that have largely avoided infection in the past. And now you're going to see small

01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:37.640
[Guest]: outbreaks in rural areas, complicating control. So that's a very short-term concern I have.

01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:42.280
[Guest]: And the question is how states are able to handle that, and what kind of, can they do

01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:47.320
[Guest]: humane quarantine to mitigate those effects? So that's the immediate consequence. And then,

01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:50.520
[Guest]: of course, the next consequence is, you know, what is the impact? Not only are you going

01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:53.680
[Guest]: to see growth in cities, which is a big driver of growth in India, but you're also going

01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:59.120
[Guest]: to see overwhelmed systems, perhaps, in these states that weren't expecting this large influx.

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:02.320
[Guest]: You know, just to give you a sense, we're working with Bihar. Bihar has a population

01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:07.600
[Guest]: of 100 million, roughly, and they're expecting to get 2 to 3 million back. So 2 to 3 percent

01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:12.000
[Guest]: of their population is coming back, which is a large number. It seems small, but from

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.880
[Guest]: a social organization perspective, that's quite a large influx. So that's going to be

01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:16.880
[Guest]: a big thing.

01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:21.280
[Guest]: But the question is, what is the consequence going forward? Like, are people going to,

01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:25.440
[Guest]: you know, is this just a temporary return to get some relief? Remember, it's still the

01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:30.880
[Guest]: height of the summer. There's still agriculture going on, so there's some rural demand. Maybe

01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:36.560
[Guest]: once cities, you know, control the infection, lockdown, it gets lifted in the big cities,

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:39.360
[Guest]: then maybe these people will immediately return, in which case we're back to the same path

01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:43.480
[Guest]: as before. Obviously, there's going to be a short-term economic crunch, especially on

01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:45.680
[Guest]: the poor, but hopefully we'll be able to return in a year.

01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:50.680
[Guest]: The alternative view is that people have just revised their views of the value of cities.

01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:55.520
[Guest]: If their belief is now that epidemics are possible and are going to come again, then

01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:59.800
[Guest]: it's going to take a little bit more for them to move to cities, which means you're going

01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:05.080
[Guest]: to see a slowing, a slowdown in the rate of urbanization in India. First, an immediate

01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:11.640
[Guest]: drop and then a slowing down of the return, which is hugely problematic from the perspective

01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:15.320
[Guest]: of India's economic development. Now, the question is, what do we do about that? And

01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:20.400
[Guest]: I can think of two things, or at least I'm thinking along two lines. The first is, for

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:24.400
[Guest]: a lot of the states that are getting migrants back, if they can look beyond the short-term

01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:29.080
[Guest]: crunch, they might see an opportunity. And what I mean by opportunity is, you know, if

01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:33.960
[Guest]: you're a state like Bihar or UP and you're getting a lot of migrants back, historically,

01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:37.960
[Guest]: you're a state that has economically lagged behind other states. And one of the reasons

01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:42.520
[Guest]: we think is because there is not as much urbanization in your states. You see a lot of small towns,

01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:47.760
[Guest]: but you don't see big cities. Big cities are much more common in the more developed states,

01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:53.320
[Guest]: especially in the south. And so the question is, can you figure out a way to get your migrants,

01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:58.960
[Guest]: instead of in some time in the future returning to Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, et cetera, can

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:04.120
[Guest]: you get them to go to cities in your state? So this is a great opportunity for you to

01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:10.360
[Guest]: urbanize quickly, provide a path for your migrants to go to local cities and grow those

01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:14.880
[Guest]: cities, take your tier three cities and make them tier two cities or better. So that's

01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:18.760
[Guest]: in some sense an opportunity, and that's what I encourage states in the Northern Belt to

01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:22.080
[Guest]: do with their returning migrants, see that as an opportunity.

01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:25.480
[Guest]: The second thing is that, you know, when we think more broadly about cities, this is a

01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:30.720
[Guest]: chance for us to kind of reassess how to make cities better, especially for the poor. And

01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:34.480
[Guest]: the fact that a lot of migrants have actually left gives you an opportunity to really restructure

01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:39.040
[Guest]: things. You know, the first and foremost is you need better infrastructure. Your cities

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:43.800
[Guest]: are growing faster than your underlying street and sanitation infrastructure, and you really

01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:47.840
[Guest]: need to kind of invest in that. That's the first thing. To do that, obviously, you'll

01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:51.520
[Guest]: need more local control and local financing that's a little bit better. That's going to

01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:54.600
[Guest]: have to be part of the answer, too, but really build that infrastructure.

01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:59.240
[Guest]: The second approach is to become a little bit more hospitable to migrants, to labor

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:03.840
[Guest]: migrants. And we're going to see that it's very hard to operate a city when a large fraction

01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:08.920
[Guest]: of your drivers, security guards, household help, et cetera, construction workers disappear.

01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:12.240
[Guest]: It's going to be hard to restart the city. You're going to appreciate that that labor

01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:16.200
[Guest]: is essential. Once you have that appreciation, it's going to be important to do things to

01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:20.560
[Guest]: make life easier for those people. That means, for example, you know, one of the big issues

01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:25.320
[Guest]: with slums is that there's the reason why we have slums is because we have restrictions

01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:29.560
[Guest]: on the growth of housing supply in cities, housing regulations, FSI regulations, things

01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:34.000
[Guest]: like that. And if we could relax some of those, that would be great. Another restriction is

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:39.600
[Guest]: just so much land that's owned by the state. If the state can start handing over land rights

01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:44.160
[Guest]: to slum dwellers, that'll entice people to come back and feel a little bit more secure

01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:47.000
[Guest]: living in cities. I think that's the second thing.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.600
[Guest]: A third issue, maybe this should have been the first issue, is to start really investing

01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:55.800
[Guest]: in public health, meaning allow the private sector in the health care system to deal with

01:59:55.800 --> 02:00:01.200
[Guest]: regular transactions for health, but have the public infrastructure, the public hospitals

02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:05.720
[Guest]: really focus on public health. So things like infectious disease and trying to help poor

02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:10.160
[Guest]: individuals make sure they have access to health care. Having that kind of renewed focus,

02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:14.240
[Guest]: narrow focus would be good. And cities really need to be at the start of that if they want

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.680
[Guest]: to get these migrants back. So those are the three things that I would think would be really

02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:18.680
[Guest]: important.

02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:22.440
[Guest]: I just want to stress again, one really, really important component of that second part is

02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:27.000
[Guest]: that not only do you provide housing to these individuals, to low-income people, but you

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:31.640
[Guest]: get rid of a lot of the required occupational licensing and other regulations that make

02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:35.400
[Guest]: it really, really hard for people to work in cities, whether it's as a shoeshine or

02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:41.000
[Guest]: starting your own small pawn shop or something like that. That's got to go away. You've got

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.280
[Guest]: to make it easier for people to economically thrive in cities without all these regulations.

02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:48.880
[Guest]: COVID is an opportunity to revisit that. We wouldn't have been able to do that in peacetime

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:52.880
[Guest]: because of a lot of vested interests. But now the vested interests are kind of back

02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:57.080
[Guest]: on their heels. And so while that's happening, this is a real opportunity to make life a

02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:00.280
[Guest]: little bit easier for poor individuals, poor people in cities.

02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:04.160
[Amit Varma]: But these are, you know, great and insightful points. I'll quickly take the opportunity

02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:08.880
[Amit Varma]: to plug episodes that I have done in the past on some of these subjects. They'll be linked

02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:13.880
[Amit Varma]: from the show notes. I've done episodes on FSI and rent control with Alex Tabarrok. I've

02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:20.160
[Amit Varma]: done an episode on slums with Pawan Srinath, where he spoke about how slums actually play

02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:24.840
[Amit Varma]: an essential role because they're the entry point of migrants from outside the city to

02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:29.200
[Amit Varma]: the city. And the solution of that, of course, as you pointed out, is increase the housing

02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:35.720
[Amit Varma]: supply. Changing our regulations around FSI is a great way of doing that. I have also

02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:42.080
[Amit Varma]: recorded an episode with Prashant Narang on this kind of licensing within cities, which

02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:47.320
[Amit Varma]: is such a problem, but that will release after this one, perhaps in a couple of weeks. I've

02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:52.720
[Amit Varma]: taken more than a couple of hours of your time. So I'm sort of now going to ask you

02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:58.400
[Amit Varma]: to sort of look into the economist's crystal ball and sort of look ahead and tell me what

02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:03.760
[Amit Varma]: are, you know, if you look five years into the future, what is sort of a best case scenario

02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:07.640
[Amit Varma]: and what is a worst case scenario? In other words, what gives you hope and what gives

02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:12.120
[Amit Varma]: you despair? Like I've heard it said, like someone framed it in a way on Twitter, the

02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:18.640
[Amit Varma]: optimistic side of things, which really struck me where I forget who this was. But this person

02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:24.320
[Amit Varma]: basically said that COVID is like a vaccine, which will give us the antibodies to fight

02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:29.880
[Amit Varma]: future pandemics, which might otherwise be worse. And I guess that's a very optimistic

02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:35.920
[Guest]: view. But what gives you reason for hope and despair? Okay, so I'll answer both parts.

02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:40.440
[Guest]: The first is I want to kind of give you worst case, best case. So the worst case scenarios,

02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:45.120
[Guest]: I think we already touched upon partly. I think that there's a risk that you're seeing

02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:51.280
[Guest]: de-urbanization that's going to last for longer than we hope. And that's going to slow growth

02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:56.360
[Guest]: structurally in India. That's one. Another thing that I think is very important is I

02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:05.200
[Guest]: fear that we're in for a rude macro awakening. So let me explain what I mean by that. So

02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:09.480
[Guest]: when we think about what COVID does, you should think about whether or not you think that

02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:13.000
[Guest]: there's a lockdown or not. There's two effects. There's an aggregate supply effect and aggregate

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.400
[Guest]: demand effect. The aggregate supply effect comes first. Either voluntary social distancing

02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:24.200
[Guest]: or mandatory lockdowns restrict your ability to work. So supply shifts in. That reduces

02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:29.960
[Guest]: the amount of economic activity and in general will tend to raise prices. But then there's

02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:35.000
[Guest]: a second effect that goes on. It offsets that a little bit, but worsens part of it, which

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:40.440
[Guest]: is that because there's less supply, there's less income that people have. They can't work,

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:43.800
[Guest]: so their incomes fall. So that reduces demand. So you have both the aggregate supply effect

02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:47.320
[Guest]: followed by an aggregate demand effect. The net result is a massive reduction in the amount

02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:53.080
[Guest]: of economic activity, although the ambiguous effect on prices. Now, governments have responded

02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:58.000
[Guest]: outside of the public health context by typically trying to address what they can, and that

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:02.240
[Guest]: is the aggregate demand effect. The way they do that is they increase supports to people.

02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:07.040
[Guest]: So in the United States, we gave out a bunch of checks to people to help supplement their

02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:12.320
[Guest]: income. And in India, you do some of that as well, although to a much lesser extent.

02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:16.400
[Guest]: And the idea here is basically do what we can. We can't address the aggregate supply

02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:22.440
[Guest]: issue because that's necessary for the or uncontrollable because of the COVID crisis.

02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:26.320
[Guest]: But the demand side, we can give people income. Now, the question is where governments got

02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:31.520
[Guest]: that money from in the first place. Now, ordinarily, if we were to think about just one country

02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:36.180
[Guest]: having suffering a shock like this, they would get a loan from the World Bank or from other

02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:39.880
[Guest]: countries going to the sovereign debt market to get money. But here we have a situation

02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:44.320
[Guest]: where the entire world is wanting to spend more. Now, there are some countries that had

02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:48.480
[Guest]: the surplus to do so, China, for example, but most countries didn't have that surplus.

02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:52.080
[Guest]: They were already operating with massive amounts of debt. And so in a world where there's more

02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:57.120
[Guest]: debt and everybody wants more money, there really is only one way that you give stimulus

02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:01.000
[Guest]: checks. It's by printing money. Now, we may mask it in very different ways, but what we're

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.840
[Guest]: doing is we're printing money.

02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:07.880
[Guest]: Now, anybody that knows how inflation works, like you use the quantity theory of money,

02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:11.800
[Guest]: you have a standard equation, Fisher's equation that tells you what the price levels are.

02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:17.400
[Guest]: And what it says is that the total supply of money is equal to the quantity of money

02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:22.520
[Guest]: that's available times the number of transactions that you have with money per day. And that

02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:27.160
[Guest]: gives you the daily supply. So not only is how many rupees there are, but how many times

02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:30.440
[Guest]: a given rupee circulates in a day tells you what the total supply of rupees is in that

02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:31.440
[Guest]: day.

02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:37.080
[Guest]: And in COVID, you have the following situation. Because you have this aggregate supply effect,

02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:42.960
[Guest]: people are not able to buy and sell goods. Velocity of money has fallen. Now, you can

02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:46.560
[Guest]: print more money and you're increasing the money supply, but you're not going to have

02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:52.000
[Guest]: a big effect on prices because again, velocity is down. So if total supply is the amount

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:55.440
[Guest]: printed times the velocity and the velocity has gone down, you can print more and kind

02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:58.200
[Guest]: of keep prices stable. Does that make sense?

02:05:58.200 --> 02:05:59.600
[Guest]: Makes absolute sense. Go on.

02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:05.520
[Guest]: Yeah. So now imagine what happens if over the next few months, you relax the constraint

02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:11.440
[Guest]: on supply. So the velocity rises. So now you've printed a whole bunch of money and now you're

02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:15.240
[Guest]: going to relax constraints that limit velocity. Velocity is going to rise. You're going to

02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:20.720
[Guest]: see a massive increase in effective money supply later on, not right now, later on as

02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:26.080
[Guest]: velocity rises. And that's going to trigger a binge of inflation. Okay. And you're going

02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:30.840
[Guest]: to have all the issues that come up with inflation that we've seen in the past and negative consequences,

02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:34.940
[Guest]: except this is going to be a weird inflation crisis because the inflation crisis where

02:06:34.940 --> 02:06:39.360
[Guest]: you've got this stock of money that's finally being released to circulate in the society.

02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:42.120
[Guest]: And we're going to have to figure out how to solve that problem. I'm not going to tell

02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:45.040
[Guest]: you that I know the answer to that, but one of the kind of the worst case scenarios that

02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:50.440
[Guest]: I worry about is a global hyperinflation problem or a global inflation problem. If we were

02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:55.760
[Guest]: 50 years ahead and everything was cryptocurrency or electronic money, the way you'd solve it

02:06:55.760 --> 02:06:59.680
[Guest]: is you'd proportionally reduce everybody's money stock, just the same way you would inflate,

02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:03.880
[Guest]: you would deflate, but we're not in that position. There's still money that's there and you have

02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:08.880
[Guest]: to figure out a way to pull money out of that system in order to control that inflation.

02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:13.000
[Guest]: So I worry a little bit about this. My prediction, if I were to make one, is that that's one

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:16.640
[Guest]: of the causes of the worst case scenario. And that's something that macroeconomists

02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:19.120
[Guest]: will be thinking about that they don't have an answer to right now.

02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:22.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And it could hurt the poor the most because inflation first and foremost is a

02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:26.960
[Amit Varma]: tax on the poor. So after what they have already been through, you know, the vicious cycle

02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:27.960
[Amit Varma]: just continues.

02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:32.360
[Guest]: Exactly right. So let's not dwell on only the negative. Let's try the positive because

02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:37.360
[Guest]: I think on net, I'm positive. To me, that stuff just tells me that this effect, it's

02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:40.440
[Guest]: not just the health component that's going to take a few years to resolve. It's going

02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:43.360
[Guest]: to be the economic component that's going to take a few years to resolve.

02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:48.720
[Guest]: But what I'm hoping is that the positive outweighs the benefits. And this is consistent with

02:07:48.720 --> 02:07:53.000
[Guest]: my general optimistic view about the world that I've learned about myself. So the first

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:56.420
[Guest]: is the issue that you pointed out, which is, you know, maybe we'll learn to handle future

02:07:56.420 --> 02:08:01.200
[Guest]: epidemics better. I'm optimistic that that'll be the case. You know, all of us have a role

02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:06.640
[Guest]: here to play, which is to hold governments accountable to doing that preparation going

02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:10.840
[Guest]: forward. So we should keep the pressure on for that and provide the assistance that we

02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:11.840
[Guest]: can.

02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:15.640
[Guest]: The second thing is I'm hoping that we are able to take this kind of de-urbanization

02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:19.680
[Guest]: as an opportunity to renew and strengthen our cities. And I'm optimistic that we'll

02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:25.240
[Guest]: do that. You know, what's amazing to me is that almost everybody I talk to, and I understand

02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:28.760
[Guest]: that that's a selected group, but almost everybody I talk to, with very few exceptions, generally

02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:33.080
[Guest]: has this view that cities are a driver of growth in India, that we need to do better

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:39.520
[Guest]: by migrant workers and slums. And we often agree on what the policies are. And the real

02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:43.480
[Guest]: issue is how do we get the government to engage in those policies? To me, that's really a

02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:48.200
[Guest]: problem of trying to understand what vested interests stand in the way and how do you

02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:52.180
[Guest]: come up with good second best policies to buy off those vested interests so you get

02:08:52.180 --> 02:08:55.920
[Guest]: better policies. That to me is the challenge going forward, but I'm optimistic that we'll

02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:00.760
[Guest]: be able to challenge it to address it with urbanization in India as well.

02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:06.240
[Guest]: The more complicated thing, I think, is really what do you do if there are structural features

02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:11.160
[Guest]: of the political system in India that make it so that it cannot achieve, for example,

02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:16.960
[Guest]: the trajectory that, say, China was on pre-COVID? So this has to do with issues of political

02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:21.520
[Guest]: competition leading to corruption in ways that China is able to control better than

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:26.140
[Guest]: we are able to control. This is the sort of things that people like James Robinson or

02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:30.920
[Guest]: that Chang-Tai Hsieh, both colleagues of mine at the University of Chicago debate, and that

02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:36.200
[Guest]: I think are an important debate for us to have in India. So in that sense, I am optimistic,

02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:40.960
[Guest]: but I think that we have to keep our eye on the ball going forward. I hope to see that,

02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:45.480
[Guest]: you know, in 10 years, India is just on a better path, especially if we're able to address

02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:49.200
[Guest]: a lot of the issues that you've raised in prior podcasts and use this opportunity to

02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:50.200
[Guest]: make those changes.

02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:54.520
[Amit Varma]: Anup, thanks so much for being so generous with your time and insights. You've given
