00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: IVM

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.640
[Amit Varma]: Let me elaborate. When you go out for coffee or dinner with friends,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.560
[Amit Varma]: do you force them to eat whatever you're having or what you feel is good for them?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.040
[Amit Varma]: No, you don't. You respect the individual autonomy and you expect them to respect yours, as they usually do.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.960
[Amit Varma]: At the end when the bill comes, you might insist on paying for it yourself,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.640
[Amit Varma]: but you never insist that one of them pays for it.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.480
[Amit Varma]: You don't steal money from their wallet when they are not looking and you don't try to leave the restaurant without paying.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.820
[Amit Varma]: And if you see a beggar outside and feel sorry for him,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.560
[Amit Varma]: you may leave the beggar something of your own volition,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.200
[Amit Varma]: but you would think it outrageous to pay nothing yourself, but force your friends to pay.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.840
[Amit Varma]: You see what I'm getting at here, right?

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.940
[Amit Varma]: We all respect the autonomy of others and we all respect the choices they make.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.360
[Amit Varma]: Consent is a big deal for us and we don't try to force other adults to do things against their wish.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.000
[Amit Varma]: We agree that violence is bad, except in self-defense. We believe in the dignity of the individual.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
[Unknown]: We are all libertarians.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:36.480
[Amit Varma]: We have no objection to state violence or to the state doing things to us that we would be outraged if anyone else did.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.720
[Amit Varma]: We misunderstand how society works and believe that societies and economies can be planned and engineered

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.320
[Amit Varma]: and ignore the fact that such planning on the behalf of others always involves violence.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.920
[Amit Varma]: Indeed, the everyday violence we face has been normalized so much that we don't think of it as violence at all.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.520
[Amit Varma]: Now, it's what I call the liberal paradox that we need the state to protect our rights and its existence does imply a certain amount of violence.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.560
[Amit Varma]: But the modern state, everywhere in the world and especially in India, goes far beyond this.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.520
[Amit Varma]: And this is a battle that libertarians constantly fight.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.520
[Amit Varma]: This normalization of violence, this overriding of individual rights in the name of an illusory greater good,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.000
[Amit Varma]: the daily assaults on human dignity.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.160
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is a man I admire deeply.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.480
[Amit Varma]: David Boaz wrote the book that first introduced me to the ideas of libertarianism, which I read at the turn of the millennium.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.120
[Amit Varma]: That book was called Libertarianism, a Primer, which he updated and expanded a few years ago into a fantastic book called The Libertarian Mind.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.240
[Amit Varma]: He writes prolifically about libertarianism and works now as an executive vice president at the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.240
[Amit Varma]: He has also been the editor of the Libertarian Reader, an excellent collection of writings about liberalism through the ages,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.480
[Amit Varma]: and the co-editor of the Cato Handbook for Congress and the Cato Handbook on Policy, which are brilliant guides to good governance.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.320
[Amit Varma]: He was kind enough to give me two hours of his time and we chatted over Skype.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.920
[Amit Varma]: Before we go to the conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.400
[Amit Varma]: This episode of The Seen and The Unseen is brought to you by Storytel.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.640
[Amit Varma]: The book I'm recommending today is an obvious choice.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.960
[Amit Varma]: It's by our guest for this episode, David Bowes.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.160
[Amit Varma]: It's his first book, Libertarianism, a Primer, which is available on Storytel in both audiobook and e-book format.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.080
[Amit Varma]: His other two books, Libertarian Mind, which is an update of that, is available in e-book format as is a Libertarian reader.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.280
[Amit Varma]: But Libertarianism, a Primer, you can actually listen to it.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.200
[Amit Varma]: So do check that out on Storytel.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.280
[Amit Varma]: And remember, you get a 30-day free trial only at storytel.com slash IBM.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.680
[Amit Varma]: David, welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.280
[Guest]: Thank you.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.480
[Amit Varma]: David, before we start off, tell me a little bit about you and about how you came to libertarian ideas.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.440
[Amit Varma]: Because when you were kind of growing up in the States, libertarian ideas weren't so common back then, right?

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.400
[Guest]: Well, that's right.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:31.760
[Guest]: On the other hand, basic libertarian ideas about individual freedom and self-reliance and not trusting the government are pretty basic to America.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.160
[Guest]: So in that sense, there was a decent background there.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.480
[Guest]: I grew up in Kentucky, in the middle of the country, sort of the South.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.560
[Guest]: And my parents were well-educated.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.520
[Guest]: I always say I'm the first in my family not to be a lawyer.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.640
[Guest]: So there was political conversation in my house.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.240
[Guest]: Not sure my brother and sister paid that much attention to it.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.080
[Guest]: But I talked about politics and policy somewhat with my parents.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:10.400
[Guest]: And then when I was in high school, I read Barry Goldwater's Conscience of a Conservative,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.880
[Guest]: which is actually a very libertarian book because much of American conservatism is very libertarian.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.400
[Guest]: And then I read Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.560
[Guest]: And then I read Ayn Rand.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.040
[Guest]: And by that point, I was pretty much on the way to being a committed libertarian.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:38.000
[Guest]: And yes, finding actual libertarianism there around 1970, early 70s, was pretty hard.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.120
[Unknown]: It was a small movement.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.560
[Guest]: And of course, we had no internet.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.760
[Guest]: So it was harder to find.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.800
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, back then, there was no Cato, no Students for Liberty, no Reason magazine.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.600
[Amit Varma]: How do you sort of find other people who think like you?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.840
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, are there moments of sort of self-doubt when where you wonder,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.040
[Amit Varma]: is there something wrong with me?

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.520
[Amit Varma]: Because I'm the only one who looks at the world like this.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.120
[Guest]: Well, I don't know that I ever felt quite like that.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:08.160
[Guest]: Like I say, there are basic libertarian ideas that suffuse American thought.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.040
[Guest]: Ayn Rand was a best-selling author, and it wasn't hard as a high school student to discover

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.160
[Guest]: Ayn Rand's work.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.280
[Guest]: I sort of stumbled on Henry Hazlitt, but Barry Goldwater had run for president on

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.440
[Guest]: a very conservative, but in some ways libertarian platform.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.120
[Guest]: So people knew about that.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:33.120
[Guest]: And what happened was that when I got to college, I joined a conservative group,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.640
[Guest]: Young Americans for Freedom.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.960
[Guest]: And of course, they said they were for freedom.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.240
[Guest]: And we were for free markets and free enterprise.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:47.200
[Guest]: And I came to discover partly by reading their magazine, oh, I see these tensions in conservatism.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.560
[Guest]: Sometimes they're for freedom.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.400
[Guest]: Sometimes they're talking about imposed order.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.720
[Guest]: And it's the freedom part that I like.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.280
[Guest]: Once you got hold of a copy of Reason magazine, then you would see ads for other libertarian

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.400
[Guest]: projects.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.680
[Guest]: So I met people in college and then after college.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.280
[Guest]: It was actually an exciting time.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.000
[Guest]: For libertarians, I should also mention there was the Foundation for Economic Education,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.560
[Guest]: FEE.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.680
[Guest]: And a lot of young conservatives got FEE's magazine, The Freeman.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:24.240
[Guest]: And that was a way to get connected to a network of people who did believe in freedom.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.600
[Guest]: But the mid 1970s was a pretty exciting time because you did have the Libertarian Party

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.120
[Guest]: being founded.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.240
[Guest]: You had Hayek.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.360
[Guest]: And Friedman winning Nobel Prizes.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.560
[Guest]: You had Robert Nozick's book coming out and winning a National Book Award.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.920
[Guest]: A little bit after that, then you did have the creation of the Cato Institute.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.440
[Guest]: And of course, Reason magazine, I think, goes back to 1969.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.560
[Guest]: So it was a smaller and less professional looking magazine then.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.720
[Guest]: But it was an exciting time.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.320
[Guest]: It was the beginning of a movement.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.040
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, just looking back at when I grew up in New York, I was a little bit more

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.360
[Amit Varma]: conservative, but looking back at when I grew up in India, which was somewhat later than

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.880
[Amit Varma]: you, and we obviously didn't have these fundamental American values of individual freedom and

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.480
[Amit Varma]: so on, which, you know, is embedded in your constitution and your way of thinking.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.240
[Amit Varma]: Over here, I often say that India's biggest religion is a religion of government.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.360
[Amit Varma]: I mean, statism is just sort of reflexive.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.920
[Amit Varma]: State violence is completely normalized.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.000
[Amit Varma]: And so it was very refreshing for me almost a couple of decades ago to read your book

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.760
[Amit Varma]: later, updated to the libertarian mind, which came out a few years ago.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, what I found interesting about the libertarian mind was at the start of it, you write about

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.360
[Amit Varma]: how the world is becoming more libertarian.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.880
[Amit Varma]: And if you look at the broader arc of history, that certainly seems to be true to some extent

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.000
[Amit Varma]: at that time.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.040
[Amit Varma]: But now, now that we live in the age of Trump and, you know, in India, Modi, for example,

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.720
[Amit Varma]: authoritarian populace across the world coming to power, and the discourse everywhere being

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:04.640
[Amit Varma]: arguments between different kinds of statism and not for liberty at all.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.920
[Amit Varma]: Are you still as optimistic?

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.640
[Guest]: Well, maybe not as optimistic, but I actually would sort of.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.400
[Guest]: Let's look at three things there.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.520
[Guest]: One is, is the world getting better?

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.800
[Guest]: Yes, absolutely.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.440
[Guest]: The world is getting more prosperous and the prosperity is more widespread.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:31.680
[Guest]: And the opportunity for people to pursue happiness in their own way is more broadly available

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.920
[Guest]: in more countries in the world.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:40.320
[Guest]: And of course, the good changes in China and India over the past generation account for

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:46.640
[Guest]: a lot of that progress and optimism because there are so many people to whom those changes

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.680
[Guest]: are relevant.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:54.800
[Guest]: So our website, humanprogress.org, details continuing progress on hunger, illiteracy,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.400
[Guest]: poverty, and so on.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:03.440
[Guest]: Is the world getting freer, which is somewhat different, though usually connected?

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.280
[Guest]: Yes, I think it still is.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:12.800
[Guest]: I think that the economic reforms in India and I think in China and I think in India,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.320
[Guest]: though I certainly yield to your expertise on that, but also some economic reforms even

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:26.640
[Guest]: happening in Africa, the decline of military dictatorships in Latin America, some policy

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.200
[Guest]: reforms in developed countries.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.520
[Guest]: Yes, I think overall we still are seeing more freedom.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.720
[Guest]: Now, what about our politics?

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:44.800
[Guest]: Well, yes, politics seems to have taken a turn for the worse since I was writing The

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.280
[Guest]: Libertarian Mind around 2013.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.720
[Guest]: We do have the rise of authoritarians in a lot of places.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.320
[Guest]: I've been saying in speeches lately, ideas we thought were dead are back.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:06.320
[Guest]: Ideas like socialism, economic nationalism, authoritarianism, even fascism.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:14.240
[Guest]: And we're facing fundamental challenges to liberalism in a way that in 2013 I probably

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.040
[Guest]: didn't sense was the case.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:23.040
[Guest]: So intellectually and politically, we have big challenges right now, probably more so

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.440
[Guest]: than I thought in 2013.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:32.080
[Guest]: But so far, I think we are still on a path of greater freedom.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.200
[Guest]: But if the politics continues in the direction it's been going the last few years, then that

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.240
[Guest]: will change.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.880
[Guest]: And it's interesting that the dead ideas that have been revived that you named like

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.280
[Amit Varma]: socialism, economic nationalism, fascism, they're all isms.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.440
[Amit Varma]: And that's kind of the reason I sometimes feel uncomfortable with the world, with the

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.720
[Amit Varma]: word libertarianism, because it seems to imply that it's a system of thinking that depends

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.120
[Amit Varma]: on certain facts about the world.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.320
[Amit Varma]: But actually, to me, it's just really a value system.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.640
[Amit Varma]: You respect individual autonomy, the dignity of others, you value consent and you stand

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.080
[Amit Varma]: against coercion.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.280
[Amit Varma]: Nothing more and nothing less.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.040
[Amit Varma]: It's not like one of the others in that sense.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.440
[Amit Varma]: So let's let's kind of talk about the fundamentals of sort of libertarianism.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.440
[Amit Varma]: What does it mean to you in simple terms?

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:28.560
[Guest]: What I like to say in speeches is libertarianism is the idea that a democracy is a system of

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:34.320
[Guest]: thinking that adults, individuals have the right and the responsibility to make the important

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.800
[Guest]: decisions about their own lives.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.440
[Guest]: And each word is important there.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.680
[Guest]: This is about the rights of adults, not necessarily children.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.680
[Guest]: That's a more complicated issue.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:53.680
[Guest]: This is also about individuals making decisions, not collectives, not nations to the extent

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.720
[Guest]: that we can avoid that, not racial groups and so on.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.960
[Guest]: Have the right, because as.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:06.480
[Guest]: Individuals as autonomous thinking, rational beings, we have the right to make the important

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.240
[Guest]: decisions about our lives.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:14.560
[Guest]: But with those rights go responsibilities, not imposed responsibilities, but just the

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:21.520
[Guest]: idea that if I make choices, I bear the consequences for the outcome of those choices.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.440
[Guest]: And that's a responsibility.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.440
[Guest]: And when we start thinking about sometimes people listen to that and they say, well,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.960
[Guest]: yes, but we do have that.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.400
[Guest]: But what's your complaint?

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:36.480
[Guest]: Well, of course, my complaint is that the government takes half the income I earn and

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.120
[Guest]: it tells me how I have to save for retirement and how I have to give to charity.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.840
[Guest]: It tells me what I can smoke and what I can drink and what I can read and who I can marry.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.280
[Guest]: And obviously not all of those things in any country at any one time.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.920
[Guest]: But but those kinds of things are the decisions that government is arrogating to itself to

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.920
[Guest]: make those decisions for me.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.120
[Guest]: I want the right to make those decisions.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.440
[Guest]: But that does mean that there will be consequences.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.480
[Guest]: And so I have a responsibility if I become a drunk or a drug addict.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.160
[Guest]: That's on me.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:17.360
[Guest]: Mostly if I don't save for my retirement, then I have to assume I have to accept responsibility

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.320
[Guest]: for that.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.800
[Guest]: I think parents should have the right to decide where their children will be educated and

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.520
[Guest]: how.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.040
[Guest]: That's also a responsibility as a parent.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:32.240
[Guest]: You should want to make the important decisions about guiding your child's life.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.360
[Guest]: And you you bear the consequences of those decisions.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.560
[Guest]: And of course, so do your children.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.920
[Guest]: And that's why it's so important to get them right.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:51.920
[Guest]: So in all of those areas, government is impinging, intruding on our right and responsibility to

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.080
[Guest]: be fully responsible adults.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, there's a really nice quote from your book, which I'm going to read out.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.200
[Amit Varma]: Quote, Libertarians believe in the presumption of liberty.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.600
[Amit Varma]: That is, Libertarians believe that people ought to be free to live as they choose, unless

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.240
[Amit Varma]: advocates of coercion can make a compelling case.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:13.200
[Amit Varma]: It's the exercise of power, not the exercise of freedom that requires justification.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.800
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, this is a very profound sentence, because what has happened in our world today,

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.840
[Amit Varma]: especially in India, but I think everywhere is a normalization of coercion, where we take

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:29.120
[Amit Varma]: a lot of state violence and state interference in our lives completely for granted.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, sometimes when I tell people that taxes are a form of coercion, it's a form

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:32.880
[Amit Varma]: of violence.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.480
[Amit Varma]: And they're like, they look at me aghast as if, you know, what on earth am I talking

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:36.720
[Amit Varma]: about?

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.440
[Amit Varma]: It's been so normalized.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.720
[Amit Varma]: And another sentence from your book, which I often, in fact, use at the start of slide

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.280
[Amit Varma]: shows when I talk about libertarianism is, quote, in a sense that have always been but

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.800
[Amit Varma]: two political philosophies, liberty and power.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.680
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.560
[Amit Varma]: And the arc of history really seems to be coming from a point where power is dominant

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.680
[Amit Varma]: to a point where liberty is asserting itself more and more.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.920
[Guest]: Well, that's right.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:08.240
[Guest]: And so all of these things are problems right now, but they have been problems in the past.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:16.960
[Guest]: And in most societies, they were more severe problems in the past, especially if we go

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.280
[Guest]: back before the rise of liberalism in the 17th and 18th centuries.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.520
[Guest]: For obviously, I know the history of the West better.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:31.200
[Guest]: The combination of church and state, the assumption that everything will stay the same, that

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:38.000
[Guest]: people's places in society are fixed, that if you're born a serf, your children will

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.440
[Guest]: be born serfs as well.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:45.120
[Guest]: All of that was a massive system of organized coercion.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:50.720
[Guest]: And of course, if you go back before that, we can argue that the the origin of states

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:57.120
[Guest]: was that the strong picked up sticks and threatened to hit or kill the weak.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.360
[Guest]: And that's how some people achieve power over others.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:06.560
[Guest]: But when liberalism came into the world, that was the problem.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:12.880
[Guest]: They were concerned about the denial of individual responsibility, of individual thought, freedom

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:21.360
[Guest]: of speech, freedom of religion and the use of power to impose other people's will on

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.080
[Guest]: you.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:29.040
[Guest]: And so since liberalism came into the world, in increasing parts of the world, people do

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.280
[Guest]: stand up and say that kind of coercion is not right.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:41.120
[Guest]: Now, you're correct to say that so many kinds of coercion go unchallenged, unnoticed by

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.920
[Guest]: most people.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.840
[Guest]: And there are different reasons for that.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:50.000
[Guest]: And many people believe that it's just necessary for the state to do more things than I think

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.160
[Guest]: it's necessary for the state to do.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.400
[Guest]: But there are also many people who have a personal agenda.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.320
[Guest]: They want their religious views imposed on everyone.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.720
[Guest]: They want their political views imposed.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.520
[Guest]: They want the state to take wealth from other people and give it to them or to prevent other

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:16.240
[Guest]: people from competing with them and possibly challenging their economic security.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:25.360
[Guest]: So there are many reasons that we haven't fully accepted the principle of liberty.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:31.680
[Guest]: But the principle of liberty, principle of natural rights, of human rights for the past

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:38.640
[Guest]: two or three centuries has been there as a vision and a beacon that can inspire people

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.400
[Guest]: and encourage them to push back against power.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.600
[Guest]: What were the American revolutionaries concerned about?

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.320
[Guest]: They were concerned about the way Britain was exercising power in this country.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:56.880
[Guest]: But they were also concerned from their study of history about the general problem of power,

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.280
[Guest]: that people with power will always want to extend it.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.120
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.480
[Amit Varma]: And I should clarify for my listeners that, you know, I'm saying libertarianism, you're

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.200
[Amit Varma]: saying liberalism.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.880
[Amit Varma]: We basically mean the same thing.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.880
[Amit Varma]: It, you know, this started off as liberalism, you know, a belief in human liberty.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.760
[Amit Varma]: And then the term liberalism somehow morphed towards the start of the 20th century, as

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.960
[Amit Varma]: you describe in your book.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.600
[Amit Varma]: And now it means different things in different parts of the world.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.720
[Amit Varma]: So especially in America, where, you know, it means almost the opposite of what it used

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.200
[Amit Varma]: to.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.440
[Amit Varma]: And old school liberals like us are called classical liberals by some, libertarians

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.320
[Amit Varma]: by others.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.640
[Amit Varma]: It's all really fundamentally the same thing.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.360
[Amit Varma]: It's really simple.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.600
[Amit Varma]: It goes down to the principle of like, you know, as you say in your book, the essence

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.080
[Amit Varma]: of this is something you learn in kindergarten.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.680
[Amit Varma]: Don't hit other people, don't take their stuff and keep your promises.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:52.160
[Amit Varma]: Just sort of talking about how sort of liberty began to assert itself against power, as it

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.880
[Amit Varma]: were, in this sort of long battle.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.400
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, the key point is the enlightenment.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:04.000
[Amit Varma]: So take me through a little bit of the early history of liberalism slash libertarianism

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.280
[Amit Varma]: and why John Locke is so important there.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.120
[Amit Varma]: And what are the ideas that came out of that?

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:20.160
[Guest]: Like I say, in the Western world, there was for 1500 years or so a dominant Catholic church.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:29.840
[Guest]: There were also princes and kings around Europe, and both parties had an interest in essentially

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.120
[Guest]: keeping things the same.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.840
[Guest]: The kings want to know that their sons and grandsons will also be kings.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:41.120
[Guest]: And that necessarily implies that the sons and grandsons of the serfs and the peasants

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.120
[Guest]: will remain in their state.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:52.880
[Guest]: And the church at that time was not very open to scientific thinking that might challenge

00:21:52.880 --> 00:22:04.240
[Guest]: the central role of religion in the world. Sometime around 1500, really, people started

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.160
[Guest]: thinking scientifically.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.640
[Guest]: They started using their reason to try to understand the world.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:18.960
[Guest]: And you get people like Galileo and Vesalius and Copernicus and Newton taking a genuinely

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:26.640
[Guest]: new scientific approach to understanding how our bodies work, how nature works, how the

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.960
[Guest]: heavens work, how the bodies in the universe work.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.760
[Guest]: And this was a new thing.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:39.920
[Guest]: This was the application of reason to understanding the world around us.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:47.280
[Guest]: And as people started doing that, it led them to some extent to question the rules that

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.080
[Guest]: authorities had set up for the world.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.640
[Guest]: So, Steven Pinker in his new book, Enlightenment Now, which I think you've talked about on

00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:03.600
[Guest]: here, identifies four elements of the Enlightenment, reason, science, humanism, and progress.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.320
[Guest]: Reason, the use of the human capacity to understand and analyze.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.560
[Guest]: Science, the application of reason to the natural world.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:18.800
[Guest]: Humanism, the idea that human institutions should be judged by how well they serve humanity.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.360
[Guest]: And then progress, the idea that things actually can change.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.640
[Guest]: They can get better.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.680
[Guest]: We can discover how the body works and use that to save lives.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:35.920
[Guest]: We can discover how nature works and harness it to provide us eventually with running water

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.320
[Guest]: and electricity and all those kinds of things.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:46.960
[Guest]: And we can come to understand how commerce makes people treat one another better.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.640
[Guest]: Sort of an old idea, you know, two ways of acquiring wealth.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.680
[Guest]: You can either take it from people or you can trade something for it.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:06.160
[Guest]: And in the Enlightenment liberal era, people started examining the way that trade was done.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:15.040
[Guest]: They started examining the way that trading is better in terms of social peace and actual

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:22.640
[Guest]: economic growth, and also noticed that people who come to each other as traders tend to

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.080
[Guest]: treat each other better.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.440
[Guest]: I've seen some scholars talk about the double thank you.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:31.360
[Guest]: When I buy something, I say thank you to the clerk and he says thank you to me.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.360
[Guest]: Because in that transaction, we've both been made better off.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.800
[Guest]: He now has money to buy whatever he needs.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:47.520
[Guest]: So this was the Enlightenment, the understanding that we could seek to understand and we could

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.040
[Guest]: anticipate progress.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:55.200
[Guest]: And then I think it's in that era that people start thinking about political institutions.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:00.560
[Guest]: What is the nature of man and what political institutions would best serve man?

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.960
[Guest]: And that's where John Locke comes in.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.720
[Guest]: About 1690, publishes his second treatise of government.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.280
[Guest]: And it says, what is the point of government?

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:16.160
[Guest]: Governments are created to protect our rights, our rights of life, liberty, and property.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:21.200
[Guest]: And we could try to protect them ourselves with sticks or guns or whatever we have.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.560
[Guest]: But there are certainly some good reasons to prefer that we create an organization that

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:31.440
[Guest]: will protect all of our rights and hopefully do so in a peaceful way.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:37.600
[Guest]: So government is created to protect individual rights and to protect private property.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:43.040
[Guest]: And if government is not serving those purposes, as we said in the Declaration of Independence,

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.000
[Guest]: it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.240
[Guest]: And then from John Locke's work on individual rights and the nature of government and Adam

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:59.040
[Guest]: Smith's work on spontaneous order and economics, we get really the whole flourishing of liberal

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:05.840
[Guest]: thought, now maybe known as libertarian thought, and also the flourishing of the world from

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:13.760
[Guest]: a world of backbreaking poverty and short life expectancies up until about 1700 and

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:21.600
[Guest]: the incredible progress of technology and economics and society since then.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.280
[Amit Varma]: And the reason this happens, obviously, is that once people have the freedom, so to say,

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:33.040
[Amit Varma]: to associate with others in whatever way they want, consenting adults can do whatever they

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.680
[Amit Varma]: want with each other, whether in the bedroom or in the marketplace.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.680
[Amit Varma]: And that leads to a positive some game like you described it, I think it's John Stossel's

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.800
[Amit Varma]: phrase, a double thank you moment, where both parties trading get better off and the amount

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:50.160
[Amit Varma]: of value in the world grows up, which is really the secret of all human success.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.480
[Amit Varma]: But sort of going back to Locke, I'll just quote another bit from your book where you

00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:00.000
[Amit Varma]: cite Locke, start quote, people have rights prior to the existence of government.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.040
[Amit Varma]: Thus, we call them natural rights because they exist in nature.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.680
[Amit Varma]: People form a government to protect their rights.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.600
[Amit Varma]: They could do that without government, but a government is an efficient system for protecting

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.000
[Amit Varma]: rights.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.680
[Amit Varma]: And if government exceeds that role, people are justified in revolting.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.320
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.960
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, just unpack this a little bit for me.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.800
[Amit Varma]: What what did Locke mean by natural rights per se?

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.680
[Amit Varma]: And also one insight, as you point out in your book, and we can talk about that later,

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:34.480
[Amit Varma]: is that even for those who don't believe in anything called natural rights, that rights

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:40.000
[Amit Varma]: cannot be natural, it would still benefit all of us the most if we proceeded on the

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.160
[Amit Varma]: assumption that we begin with the right to self-ownership, which is at the heart of Locke's

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:44.560
[Amit Varma]: thinking.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.720
[Guest]: Yes, well, that's right.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:53.120
[Guest]: So philosophers have been arguing ever since Locke about what rights are and whether they

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.040
[Guest]: can actually be justified.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:04.240
[Guest]: But Locke's argument was that we have rights inherent in the nature of man as a being capable

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.360
[Guest]: of reason.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.760
[Guest]: And so these rights are natural.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:13.360
[Guest]: We often say in the United States, the Constitution gives me the right to do that.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.520
[Guest]: Well, no, we really should say the Constitution protects my right to do that.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:23.440
[Guest]: I have a right to think the way I want to, to marry who I want to, to travel where I

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:23.920
[Guest]: want to.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.160
[Guest]: The Constitution protects those rights.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:36.000
[Guest]: And so the rights are natural or unalienable, as we said in the Declaration of Independence.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.280
[Guest]: And once we understand that, then we see the need for an agency to protect those rights

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.040
[Guest]: from threats from other people.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:45.840
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:51.520
[Amit Varma]: And what's happened in sort of modern times is that like all these terms get muddied,

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:56.480
[Amit Varma]: the term rights has also gotten muddied in the sense that we have what I would rather

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:01.840
[Amit Varma]: call entitlements, which aren't rights at all, also being spoken of as rights, for example,

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.040
[Amit Varma]: the right to food, the right to livelihood, the right to broadband.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.840
[Amit Varma]: And so on, which are really positive rights.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.440
[Amit Varma]: Can you just sort of explain the difference between negative rights and positive rights

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.080
[Amit Varma]: and how they muddy these waters?

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.280
[Guest]: Yes.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:22.240
[Guest]: Negative rights means that I have a right to take action, to live as I choose without

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.600
[Guest]: interference by others.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:31.120
[Guest]: So in that sense, you know, it is a negative on your ability to coerce me.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:38.560
[Guest]: Positive right means that I have a right to be given something by some agency, from you,

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.480
[Guest]: from the government, from some human source.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:50.240
[Guest]: And the important point, I think, is that negative rights can be enjoyed by everyone

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.160
[Guest]: in every society, no matter how poor the society is.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.960
[Guest]: We can all agree that we will not hit each other or take each other's stuff.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:04.160
[Guest]: We can agree that people can say whatever they want to and they will not be arrested

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.760
[Guest]: or executed for it.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:11.040
[Guest]: We can agree that people can grow food on their own property and they can either eat

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.520
[Guest]: it or exchange it with other people.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:19.280
[Guest]: When you start talking about positive rights, like the right to food or shelter, the right

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.840
[Guest]: to a college education, the right to have your children taken care of at government

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:32.240
[Guest]: expense, all of those things require someone else to provide this benefit to you.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:39.440
[Guest]: And because of that, they require infringing on your negative rights.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:46.880
[Guest]: When somebody says, I have a right to 12 years of education at public expense, which

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:55.440
[Guest]: is what they always mean, then that means they have the power to tax me to educate their

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.280
[Guest]: children for 12 years.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.080
[Guest]: Now, the argument is, well, it's all for all.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.600
[Guest]: We're all in this together.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:07.520
[Guest]: But of course, we all have different views about what kind of education is appropriate,

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.800
[Guest]: what kind of health care, how we want to spend our money.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:16.240
[Guest]: When you tax me, you don't know exactly what cost you might be imposing on me.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:22.560
[Guest]: So negative rights can be enjoyed by everyone without infringing on other people.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.960
[Guest]: Positive rights can only be enjoyed at the expense of other people.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:33.200
[Guest]: And so one obvious point about positive rights is if you have a poor society, you simply

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.360
[Guest]: can't have all these positive rights.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:40.000
[Guest]: And therefore, as an amateur philosopher, I would say, well, then they're not right.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.480
[Guest]: They may be entitlements.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.240
[Guest]: They may be things you think are a good idea when we get wealthy.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:52.480
[Guest]: But if you had tried to guarantee a right to food or a right to six years of education

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.200
[Guest]: in the United States very early on, we just didn't have the money.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.520
[Guest]: India 50 years ago didn't have the money to do those things.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:07.200
[Guest]: Even today, the United States may not have the money to provide all the things that Bernie

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.240
[Guest]: Sanders and other Democratic socialists want.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.960
[Guest]: And of course, when you try to supply all those things by government, you usually get

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:23.360
[Guest]: less economic growth, therefore lower wages, less efficient economies, less useful services

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.400
[Guest]: being provided, and sometimes much worse than that.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.960
[Amit Varma]: And I should really clarify on both our behalves.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.560
[Amit Varma]: Like when I talk about the difference between negative and positive rights, you know, especially

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.480
[Amit Varma]: in India, people look at me and ask, how can you say, you know, there's no right to food

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.240
[Amit Varma]: or water and these are just basic things.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.440
[Amit Varma]: And I'd like to point out that these are very desirable to say that they are not rights

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:48.080
[Amit Varma]: is not to say that people should go hungry, or people should not be educated.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:53.120
[Amit Varma]: It's just to point out that if you want the state to provide for that, it comes at a cost,

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.320
[Amit Varma]: it comes at a moral cost, obviously, of the violence that they're inflicting on other

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.200
[Amit Varma]: citizens.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:02.480
[Amit Varma]: And it also comes at a cost to recipients themselves, because there's always a trade

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.880
[Amit Varma]: off between this kind of distribution and growth.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.320
[Amit Varma]: And only growth lifts people out of poverty.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:14.720
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, there are better ways to achieve all of these things without necessarily using

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.640
[Amit Varma]: coercive means.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:22.480
[Amit Varma]: And this, you know, often kind of gets lost in translation while talking about rights.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.360
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, obviously, for a poor country, there are difficult questions that this brings

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:27.520
[Amit Varma]: up.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:31.360
[Amit Varma]: And I'll come to them a little later on, because I have a bunch of difficult questions

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:36.000
[Amit Varma]: that libertarians should confront and answer.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.240
[Amit Varma]: So kind of, you know, again, moving on from Locke to, you know, the right to self ownership,

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:45.680
[Amit Varma]: where his heart of the heart of his argument is that, look, you know, who owns us, you

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.760
[Amit Varma]: know, it cannot be that everybody owns everybody that doesn't work, it cannot be that some

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.880
[Amit Varma]: tyrant owns you, because, you know, where does that come from?

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:58.880
[Amit Varma]: So it is natural and almost self evident to say that we own ourselves and that self ownership.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.880
[Amit Varma]: And from that, you get the right to life and liberty, you get the right to free speech.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.960
[Amit Varma]: And interestingly, and what I want to ask you about is the right to property.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:14.080
[Amit Varma]: Now, this is the right to property is something that is under dispute from essentially all

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:19.040
[Amit Varma]: of these other philosophies of thinking, whether it's socialism or fascism or economic nationalism

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:24.640
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, all of them, in some senses, attack the right to property and behave almost

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:27.360
[Amit Varma]: as if there is something fundamentally immoral about this.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.720
[Amit Varma]: Can you unpack that for me?

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.120
[Guest]: Yes, they all do.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:36.320
[Guest]: On the other hand, the right to property, the feeling that this thing I have worked

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:41.840
[Guest]: for or this thing I have created is mine, I think is pretty natural to human beings.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.400
[Guest]: I don't think it's just in America.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:50.720
[Guest]: I think everywhere in the world, people feel that something I've created or land that

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.680
[Guest]: I've worked.

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:58.000
[Guest]: And that's what Locke said was that by mixing your labor with land that was formerly unowned,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.440
[Guest]: you make it yours.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:06.560
[Guest]: Now, a whole body of property law arises from that so that people now own land that they

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.000
[Guest]: themselves have not worked.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.560
[Guest]: They may be renting it out to other people and so on.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:18.000
[Guest]: But it's come through a process of, at least in theory, originally, somebody mixed his

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.760
[Guest]: labor with the land and acquired it that way and then was able, through a series of contracts,

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:29.360
[Guest]: to transfer it to his children, to people to whom he sold it or rented it and so on.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.680
[Guest]: Societies that have actually tried to abolish the right of property have turned into disasters.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.720
[Guest]: The best example would be the Soviet Union after the 1917 Revolution.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.960
[Guest]: They were really dedicated communists.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:48.880
[Guest]: They really did believe from each according to his ability to each according to his needs,

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.200
[Guest]: abolish property, abolish money.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.240
[Guest]: And it was an immediate disaster.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.760
[Guest]: We look at the pictures of Venezuela and we think how horrible that is.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:05.760
[Guest]: That sort of collapse happened in very short order in the Soviet Union from 1917 to 1921.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:11.520
[Guest]: And historians now call it war communism to blame it on the war.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:18.400
[Guest]: But what it was, was the best attempt ever to actually implement communism, a system

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:27.520
[Guest]: of true public ownership of all the property in society and distribution of resources on

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.880
[Guest]: the basis of need and not on the basis of money.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.520
[Guest]: And it was such a disaster that Lenin created the new economic policy, which essentially

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:42.400
[Guest]: created a sort of extremely stunted and interventionist market economy.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:49.440
[Guest]: Because if you don't say this house is yours, this factory belongs, this factory is under

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:55.360
[Guest]: the authority of someone who can make decisions about it, then you get total collapse of the

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.800
[Guest]: economy the way they did in 1920, 21.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:08.320
[Guest]: So there are a lot of ideologies that do not believe in an absolute right to poverty.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:16.080
[Guest]: Most of them don't deny the efficacy of private property ownership.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:23.360
[Guest]: They just don't think it can be that it should be absolute because there are higher causes,

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:30.000
[Guest]: whether that is allocating resources to our ethnic or religious group or indeed allocating

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.680
[Guest]: resources simply to the needs of the nobles or the monarchs or the parliament or the ruling

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.180
[Guest]: class.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.840
[Guest]: We have to make those kinds of exceptions.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:46.240
[Guest]: The countries that have been most successful have been those that have been best at protecting

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:55.440
[Guest]: property rights of each individual, of each corporate entity, and not severely interfering

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.680
[Guest]: with them through government interactions.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:04.640
[Amit Varma]: And of course, as you point out in your book, this is not just taking on from sort of a

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:09.280
[Amit Varma]: logical continuation of the right to self-ownership and therefore almost a normative moral point

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.160
[Amit Varma]: as it were.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.840
[Amit Varma]: But it's also for practical reasons that you need the right to property.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.240
[Amit Varma]: As you say in your book, quote, if our world were not characterized by scarcity, we wouldn't

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.360
[Amit Varma]: need property rights.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.120
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.160
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I had an episode on the right to property about how it's been eroded in

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.520
[Amit Varma]: India, like it started off as one of our fundamental rights and now it no longer is.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.920
[Amit Varma]: I had an episode on that with the economist Shruti Rajagopalan where she elaborated on

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.200
[Amit Varma]: this much more.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:40.720
[Amit Varma]: But another thing that, you know, not having a strong right to property does is it affects

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.360
[Amit Varma]: incentives.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.880
[Amit Varma]: And I'll just tell you a quick story about something that a friend of mine worked on.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:50.320
[Amit Varma]: There's a friend of mine called Barun Mitra, a writer in Delhi, who campaigned for many

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:55.760
[Amit Varma]: years to get a group of tribals property rights on land that they'd been occupying for generations.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.320
[Amit Varma]: I think it was in the state of Gujarat with other activists.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:06.320
[Amit Varma]: And finally, it came through and very innovatively using technology, using GPS data over a period

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.480
[Amit Varma]: of years, they managed to prove that this land was indeed theirs and they got the land

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:15.840
[Amit Varma]: rights. And the first thing they did when they got legal title was they built toilets

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.480
[Amit Varma]: in their houses.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:23.840
[Amit Varma]: And that to me is just so revelatory of the power of the incentive of property rights

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:28.880
[Amit Varma]: that the moment people actually own property, you have private ownership, the incentives

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.480
[Amit Varma]: change, they look after that property so much better.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:37.360
[Amit Varma]: And you can just see the difference between private and public property pretty much everywhere.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.840
[Guest]: Yes, you absolutely can.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.680
[Guest]: You know, there's a saying in the United States, nobody ever washes a rented car.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.480
[Guest]: You wash your own car.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.240
[Guest]: You want to keep up the value of your car, but you don't have much incentive to wash

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.640
[Guest]: a car you're just renting for a few days.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.440
[Guest]: That's that's the problem of the owner.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:00.000
[Guest]: And the same thing is true with publicly owned housing.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.240
[Guest]: It tends to deteriorate because there's no owner there who cares that when a window is

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.800
[Guest]: broken or a window sill is cracked, that you need to fix that.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.240
[Guest]: And it's true even just with renters of housing.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:20.240
[Guest]: If I'm renting an apartment, I care how good it is to live in, but its long term value

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.000
[Guest]: is of less interest to me.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.320
[Guest]: So keeping up the maintenance, painting when appropriate, patching holes, all those things

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.240
[Guest]: I'm going to be less careful about than I would be if I owned it.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:37.840
[Guest]: And of course, people who are renting out their property develop ways to take care of

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.080
[Guest]: that.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.680
[Guest]: They have security deposits.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.240
[Guest]: They have they check in sometimes.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:46.800
[Guest]: They make sure the the renter knows that you can call me if there's a problem because I

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.520
[Guest]: will want to fix it, all that sort of thing.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:54.800
[Guest]: But it's absolutely true that if you take away the ownership incentive, people have

00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:02.880
[Guest]: much less reason to make their property well maintained, long lasting and productive.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:10.480
[Guest]: The fact that I am able to reap the benefits of whatever I plant on my property makes me

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.440
[Guest]: want to do that.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:18.000
[Guest]: If I am allowed to plant corn on a piece of land, but I don't actually own the land, then

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.480
[Guest]: I'm not going to build a house for myself.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:26.000
[Guest]: I will build a house when I know that I have secure property rights or secure rental rights.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.160
[Guest]: If I'm confident that I live in a society with the rule of law and I've rented this

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.840
[Guest]: property for 20 years, then maybe I build a house.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:40.320
[Guest]: Property rights create the incentive to maintain property.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:44.320
[Guest]: And one of the points there, you know, from a sort of environmentalist or sustainable

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:51.760
[Guest]: development point, is it's ownership that makes people look at the long term.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:57.200
[Guest]: Because I figure someday I'm going to sell this property or maybe I'm going to leave

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.480
[Guest]: it to my son or daughter.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:06.240
[Guest]: But either way, I have a long term interest in maintaining the quality of the property,

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.760
[Guest]: whether that's a house or a field or a forest or whatever.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:15.840
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, moving on from sort of the moral case for libertarianism, for respecting

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.440
[Amit Varma]: individual freedom, which is that which comes from self ownership, we all own ourselves

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.520
[Amit Varma]: for the right to life and liberty and all of that.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:27.200
[Amit Varma]: There's also a consequentialist case which simply argues that, listen, forget natural

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.480
[Amit Varma]: rights, it doesn't matter.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:33.680
[Amit Varma]: If you want society to grow and to prosper, then you need individual freedom.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.280
[Amit Varma]: Expand on that a little bit.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:40.320
[Amit Varma]: What evidence we have to show that freedom really benefits the world at large?

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.040
[Guest]: Well, that's right.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:47.040
[Guest]: So my own view is basically I agree with the Declaration of Independence.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:52.240
[Guest]: All men are endowed by their creator or by nature with certain inalienable rights.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.480
[Guest]: And that is a self evident truth.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:01.920
[Guest]: I believe that it is wrong to use force against other people, except defensively.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.920
[Guest]: So if you're pointing a gun at me, I have a right to defend myself.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:11.920
[Guest]: But otherwise, I should not be the one to pick up a stick or a gun and try to take something

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.240
[Guest]: of yours or impose my will on you.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.800
[Guest]: And to me, that is self evident.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:22.800
[Guest]: And I think to most people, even if they can't develop a theory of individual rights, they

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:28.480
[Guest]: know it's wrong to pick up a gun or a stick and force people to act in a way they wouldn't

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:28.960
[Guest]: want to.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:34.000
[Guest]: So that is the self evident case for individual rights.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
[Guest]: But it is also true.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.880
[Guest]: And, you know, I work at a policy institute.

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.480
[Guest]: So what we make are consequentialist arguments all the time.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:49.760
[Guest]: Set aside whether it is, in fact, a whether we are endowed by our creator with certain

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.040
[Guest]: inalienable rights.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:59.360
[Guest]: Let's just say we want to live in a society that is peaceful and prosperous and harmonious.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.040
[Guest]: How do we make that happen?

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:07.440
[Guest]: Well, it seems clear we do need to respect people's individual choices, whether or not

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.400
[Guest]: you think it's a right.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:15.760
[Guest]: Respecting people's choices allows them to advance their own interests in a way that

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.080
[Guest]: doesn't harm other people.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:23.520
[Guest]: Allowing private property means that people have an incentive to use their property to

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.800
[Guest]: create wealth.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:31.200
[Guest]: Allowing market exchanges means that people have an incentive to think of how they can

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.240
[Guest]: serve others.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:38.720
[Guest]: You know, we we do talk about libertarianism in terms of individualism and individual rights.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:44.560
[Guest]: But really, it's a system that enables cooperation.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:51.920
[Guest]: And we libertarians believe in cooperation so strongly that we want social institutions

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:55.920
[Guest]: that enable it and social institutions like private property.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.120
[Guest]: I know what is mine.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.720
[Guest]: I know what is yours.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.920
[Guest]: Market exchange.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.120
[Guest]: I can exchange some of what I have for some of what you have.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.880
[Guest]: The rule of law, sound money.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:12.720
[Guest]: The fact that I know if I sell this to you for ten dollars, that ten dollars will be

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.760
[Guest]: worth it.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:18.720
[Guest]: Ten dollars will be worth just as much a year from now, ten years from now.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:24.000
[Guest]: The sounder the money is, the easier it is to make economic transactions.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:34.320
[Guest]: So all the benefits that we see from economic growth rest on the idea that people own things,

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:40.560
[Guest]: other people own other things, and we're all allowed to make exchanges and contracts with

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:47.520
[Guest]: each other in order to achieve mutually beneficial improvements in our situation.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:53.920
[Guest]: And you take each one of those improvements and you add up hundreds of millions of those

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.760
[Guest]: improvements and you get economic growth.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:03.280
[Guest]: You move from the quality of life in 1900 to the quality of life in 2000.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:04.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:10.800
[Amit Varma]: You know, one of the things that's always baffled me is that it's fairly evident that

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, all of political philosophy is really this tussle between liberty and power.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:19.600
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you'd imagine the political spectrum to split up like that, where you

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:24.160
[Amit Varma]: have extreme liberty, you have complete liberty on one side and, you know, statism and power

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:24.720
[Amit Varma]: on the other side.

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.400
[Amit Varma]: But that's not how it's split up.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:31.280
[Amit Varma]: For example, one of the things that baffles me is that, look, almost everybody will agree

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:36.000
[Amit Varma]: that it is okay for two consenting adults to do whatever they want with each other as

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.080
[Amit Varma]: long as they're not infringing someone else's rights.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.960
[Amit Varma]: But people will have different approaches to whether that happens in a bedroom or whether

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.160
[Amit Varma]: it happens in the marketplace.

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:49.600
[Amit Varma]: There'll be one group of people who will say that no, personal freedoms are sacrosanct,

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:53.040
[Amit Varma]: but hey, when it comes to the marketplace, the principle suddenly changes and the state

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.240
[Amit Varma]: must intervene.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:59.680
[Amit Varma]: And there'll be other groups of people who will kind of look at it differently and want

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:04.240
[Amit Varma]: economic freedom in the marketplace, but they will want to clamp down on personal freedoms.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:10.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, and this dissonance is what causes people to say that, hey, I'm socially liberal

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.360
[Amit Varma]: and fiscally conservative, you know, which kind of baffles me.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.760
[Amit Varma]: How has the spectrum divvied up like this?

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:22.240
[Guest]: Well, one of the problems is that when you state libertarian principles in their broadest

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:28.480
[Guest]: form, like everybody should have the right to live their life as they choose, make the

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.840
[Guest]: decisions they want so long as they don't interfere with the rights of others.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.040
[Guest]: Everybody agrees with that.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.080
[Guest]: And then you're right.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.360
[Guest]: People have different views of, oh, but I didn't mean that.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:44.640
[Guest]: No, no, that's against God's will or that's not helping the poor, not helping the marginalized

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:45.040
[Guest]: people.

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:53.360
[Guest]: So they divide into different groups on the basis of which ways they want to violate individual

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.800
[Guest]: rights, that they think that should override that.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.520
[Guest]: Why have they divided this particular way?

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.800
[Guest]: That's an interesting question.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.800
[Guest]: I don't know that it's true all over the world, and it hasn't always been true.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:11.760
[Guest]: Obviously, there was a time when, at least in European history, you had the old regime

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.760
[Guest]: of monarchy and nobility and the established church.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:22.240
[Guest]: And then you had liberalism, which argued for the rights of individuals and the rights

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.640
[Guest]: of markets and contracts, right to make contracts.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.360
[Guest]: And so there you did have liberalism versus statism.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:41.840
[Guest]: One argument is that as liberalism got rolling, this new idea of socialism came into existence.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:49.360
[Guest]: And socialism wanted to achieve the goals of liberalism, widespread prosperity.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:55.440
[Guest]: But it did it with, in a sense, old-fashioned authoritarian methods, the kind of methods

00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:02.400
[Guest]: the kings and queens had used to take people's property, redistribute it, reassign it, forbid

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:09.200
[Guest]: people to do things that violated some rule or somebody's idea of what should be a social

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:09.520
[Guest]: norm.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:18.960
[Guest]: And as liberalism basically eradicated the old order so that in the Western world, we

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:25.520
[Guest]: just don't have kings and queens with power anymore, the people who might otherwise have

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:34.000
[Guest]: been defenders of the old order, the kings and the nobles, became conservatives who preferred

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.080
[Guest]: the system of liberal markets to socialism.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:48.720
[Guest]: And so then you got a world where it was sort of market liberalism against socialism, which

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:55.200
[Guest]: still claimed to support liberal values of individual rights and seeking prosperity.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:50:01.520
[Guest]: And people who were more moderate socialists then continued to believe mostly in freedom

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:06.480
[Guest]: of speech and rights for minorities and those kinds of things.

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:11.760
[Guest]: But they didn't believe very strongly in rights of private property and free enterprise.

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:16.240
[Guest]: So I think at least in England and the United States and maybe the rest of Europe, that's

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.800
[Guest]: part of the division that was happening.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:27.520
[Guest]: I've heard people say that one of the reasons for the differences you're talking about is

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:36.160
[Guest]: that people want to regulate or outlaw the impulses that they fear in themselves.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:44.400
[Guest]: And that if people are perhaps particularly drawn to sexual activities that they fear

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:51.600
[Guest]: may actually be wrong, or they're drawn to look at pornography or to use mind-altering

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:57.680
[Guest]: substances like alcohol or marijuana, that's what they want to outlaw.

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.200
[Guest]: So they want to outlaw homosexuality or adultery.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.280
[Guest]: They want to outlaw marijuana.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.600
[Guest]: Sometimes they want to outlaw alcohol.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:15.200
[Guest]: And alternatively, if what you fear in yourself is greed and you fear that you just know that

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:21.200
[Guest]: if you had the opportunity, you would cheat people, then you want a big government structure

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.040
[Guest]: to prevent people from being greedy and cheating others.

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:33.040
[Guest]: I've also heard the theory that actually a friend of mine made that argument once.

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.920
[Guest]: And I said, so then what do libertarians fear?

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.080
[Guest]: And he said, they fear the will to power.

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.680
[Guest]: They feel in themselves a will to power.

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:45.440
[Guest]: They know it's wrong, and therefore they want to control power.

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:45.920
[Guest]: I don't know.

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.080
[Guest]: I don't feel like I feel a will to power.

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.720
[Guest]: But there could be something to that.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:56.320
[Guest]: At any rate, there are many arguments for infringing on other people's liberty.

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:03.600
[Guest]: They usually go back to something that you personally find morally offensive, whether

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:08.080
[Guest]: it's smoking marijuana or paying someone less than the minimum wage.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:14.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I certainly don't feel the will to power either, though I do feel a will to

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.240
[Amit Varma]: be just left alone.

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:21.040
[Amit Varma]: There's a great quote by you in your book again, which really sums it up really nicely.

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:25.200
[Amit Varma]: And I like quoting this to people, which is quote, conservatives want to be your daddy

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.520
[Amit Varma]: telling you what to do and what not to do.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:31.520
[Amit Varma]: Liberals want to be your mommy feeding you, tucking you in and wiping your nose.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.080
[Amit Varma]: Libertarians want to treat you as an adult.

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.360
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.280
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I think the problem, at least sitting where I am in India, where, of course,

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.240
[Amit Varma]: I am probably one of about three or four libertarians in the whole country.

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:49.200
[Amit Varma]: But the problem here is that both sides of our political spectrum, such as it is, want

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.400
[Amit Varma]: to be both your daddy and your mommy to differing extents.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.800
[Amit Varma]: There's just no respect for individual freedom or rights or even what it entails.

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.080
[Amit Varma]: It's not even part of the discourse.

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.720
[Amit Varma]: So we're going to take a quick commercial break and then we are going to come back to

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:06.880
[Amit Varma]: get deeper into the mechanics of how freedom works.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:07.440
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:09.840

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:22.320
[Unknown]: On the Sponge Podcast, Amit Parmesh Varun discusses how leaders become great with characteristics

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.760
[Unknown]: of humility and humbleness.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.840

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.120
[Unknown]: HS about the hows and whys of voting.

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.800
[Unknown]: And with that, let's get you on with your shows.

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.080
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with David Bose about libertarianism.

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:07.680
[Amit Varma]: So, David, so far, we've kind of spoken about how, you know, liberty started asserting itself

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:12.640
[Amit Varma]: in this battle against power, so to say, in the Western world, starting with the Enlightenment

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.840
[Amit Varma]: and John Locke's ideas.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:18.640
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, you've taken us through the natural rights argument and the consequentialist

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:21.360
[Amit Varma]: argument, which, you know, to my mind, just speaks for itself.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, look at this world over the last 200 years.

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:30.960
[Amit Varma]: That's a series of voluntary exchanges and the positive some game playing itself out.

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:37.760
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of, you know, you've outlined a bunch of ideas as key concepts of libertarianism

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.040
[Amit Varma]: in your book.

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:42.960
[Amit Varma]: And I want to quickly go through them one by one, because they're both quite insightful.

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:47.840
[Amit Varma]: And also to someone who is completely unfamiliar with liberalism or libertarianism, they might

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:52.080
[Amit Varma]: even be surprising because the first of them is individualism.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:57.120
[Amit Varma]: And you say, quote, for libertarians, a basic unit of social analysis is an individual,

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.000
[Amit Varma]: stop quote.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.880
[Amit Varma]: And individualism gets a bad rap nowadays, right?

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:06.960
[Amit Varma]: People say, oh, individualism means, you know, your atomism and, you know, no respect for

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.520
[Amit Varma]: society.

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.680
[Guest]: And that's not the kind of world we want to live in.

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.240
[Guest]: Yes, people do make those kinds of criticism.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:21.360
[Guest]: That's the standard criticism of liberty and individual rights is individualism, excessive

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:23.360
[Guest]: individualism, egoism.

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.360
[Guest]: You're only concerned about yourself.

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:30.720
[Guest]: Well, as I mentioned earlier, one of the things that happens in a market economy is if I'm

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:36.320
[Guest]: concerned about making money to improve the lives of myself and my family, I have to think

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:40.160
[Guest]: about what can I do that people will pay me for.

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:49.440
[Guest]: So whether that's shining shoes or manufacturing shoes or designing insurance products, I am

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:53.120
[Guest]: thinking each day, what will people pay me to do?

00:56:53.120 --> 00:57:00.960
[Guest]: So in that sense, the market economy is the most socially beneficial institution that's

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.240
[Guest]: ever been created.

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:09.120
[Guest]: It requires people to think about how they can serve others, not coercively.

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:16.160
[Guest]: But as Adam Smith said, the baker's regard to his self-interest is what causes him to

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:24.080
[Guest]: get up at 4 a.m. and bake bread before people are out shopping for their breakfast.

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:28.640
[Guest]: So individualism gets a bad rap that way.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:37.440
[Guest]: I think also as a teacher, as a preacher, as a theologian or a philosopher, you're going

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:40.640
[Guest]: to say there are ways to get lead a good life.

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:45.280
[Guest]: And one of the ways to do that is prudence and balance.

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:50.720
[Guest]: It isn't necessarily a good thing to make making money the most important or the only

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.400
[Guest]: important thing in your life.

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:57.360
[Guest]: You may find that your life will be better served if you have a faith community, if you

00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:00.080
[Guest]: have a family, if you have friends and neighbors.

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.680
[Guest]: But people have different preferences for all of those things.

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:10.240
[Guest]: And what I always figure is if there are people who are just out to make as much money as

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:17.040
[Guest]: they can, that might not be the best life for them, but they're serving me because they're

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:25.520
[Guest]: staying up all night creating Microsoft or iPhones or financial products that allow me

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.200
[Guest]: to save for retirement.

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:33.200
[Guest]: I can just put my money every month in a basic index fund and feel fairly confident that

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.880
[Guest]: I'm saving for my retirement.

00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:40.320
[Guest]: But somebody had to create the companies and somebody had to create the idea of an index

00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.640
[Guest]: fund and so on and so on.

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:48.080
[Guest]: And so in that sense, those people may not actually be living their best life, but they

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:55.280
[Guest]: are serving other people by creating these things that improve our lives.

00:58:55.280 --> 00:59:01.040
[Amit Varma]: In fact, one enormously counterintuitive insight is that self-interest for all the bad rap

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:05.040
[Amit Varma]: that it gets is in practice the best form of altruism.

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:09.040
[Amit Varma]: Like our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru didn't like the profit motive very much when

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.120
[Amit Varma]: speaking to the industrialist JRD Tata.

00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:13.920
[Amit Varma]: He once said, quote, do not speak to me of profit.

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.920
[Amit Varma]: It is a dirty word.

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.920
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.040
[Amit Varma]: And the point I often keep making is that profit is the best form of philanthropy because

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.080
[Amit Varma]: there is only one way to make a profit.

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.800
[Amit Varma]: You make somebody else's life better off.

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.200
[Amit Varma]: That's the whole nature of the double thank you moment.

00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:34.160
[Amit Varma]: And if we all are consider nothing but profit on how we can make our own lives better off,

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:38.560
[Amit Varma]: and we do that in legitimate ways, which is profit seeking and not using the power of

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:42.000
[Amit Varma]: the state or rent seeking, which is a subject I'll come to later.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.600
[Guest]: But that's right.

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.760
[Guest]: All of this is true.

00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:50.560
[Guest]: As long as we understand that we are doing it peacefully within the rule of law, people

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:59.840
[Guest]: who are so obsessed with accumulation of money or property that they will use a gun or the

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:07.680
[Guest]: power of government to make their profits are not socially beneficial and do deserve

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:13.680
[Guest]: criticism not for being ego is to excessive individualist, but for violating our rights.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:19.760
[Guest]: But as long as we do it within the peaceful and lawful system, then every time we seek

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:25.600
[Guest]: a profit, it is because in order to seek a profit, we have to think about what other

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.680
[Amit Varma]: people would like to buy.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.600
[Amit Varma]: And I have sort of a tangential thought here.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:35.120
[Amit Varma]: Tell me what you think of it, which is that the nature of the state and the institutions

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.680
[Amit Varma]: that surround it also determine social attitudes.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:45.440
[Amit Varma]: For example, it's a theory I've had that because the Indian state is so all encompassing and

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:50.200
[Amit Varma]: because the easiest way to make money is to use the coercive power of the state or become

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:55.520
[Amit Varma]: a part of it or use it in some way and it's through rent seeking and not profit seeking

01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:01.200
[Amit Varma]: that the attitudes that have percolated down to society are attitudes of how do I exploit

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:07.480
[Amit Varma]: so and so person rather than how do I do something which will make his life better off and you

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.480
[Amit Varma]: know, make money in that sense.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:15.120
[Amit Varma]: And if this is a commonplace social attitude, to some extent, it seems to me also the fault

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:18.800
[Amit Varma]: of the pervasive state and these sort of rent seeking institutions.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:23.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the easiest way to make money, honestly, is through rent seeking, though that has changed

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.520
[Amit Varma]: in the last 30 something years.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.320
[Amit Varma]: But what do you feel about that?

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.360
[Guest]: Well, absolutely.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:33.800
[Guest]: I think people get up every morning thinking, how can I make my life and my family's life

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.160
[Guest]: better than it was yesterday?

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.680
[Guest]: How can we have a better year than we did last year?

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:46.600
[Guest]: And if the easiest thing around is, well, first, if the easiest thing around is to pick

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:52.240
[Guest]: up a gun and rob a bank and know you'll get away with it, well, then too many people will

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.600
[Guest]: do that.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:02:01.120
[Guest]: If the easiest thing is to go to government and get a tariff or a subsidy or a ban on

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.000
[Guest]: your competitors, then people will do that.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.440
[Guest]: But those things are generally not available if the government is too small or sufficiently

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.720
[Guest]: uncorrupt that it won't do those things.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.160
[Guest]: But we're not really talking about corruption.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.160
[Guest]: We're talking about what's within the law.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:24.240
[Guest]: If you know that your city government will not give you a subsidy to create a business

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:29.040
[Guest]: and will not pass a regulation to shut down your competitors, then you will have to turn

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.400
[Guest]: your attention to actually serving customers.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:39.520
[Guest]: And of course, in a market society with a lot of businesses, most people's first thought

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.080
[Guest]: is how do I make a better product?

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.760
[Guest]: How do I sell it on a better corner, whatever, that will enable me to make money?

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:51.240
[Guest]: But if those governmental options are available, some people will notice them.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.560
[Guest]: And I've written about this numerous times about companies, particularly in our tech

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:02.920
[Guest]: industry, which, as you may know, is mostly out west, 3,000 miles from Washington, D.C.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:07.520
[Guest]: And I think those companies were out there tinkering in garages and coming up with great

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:12.380
[Guest]: ideas and building companies and ignoring the federal government.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:17.600
[Guest]: And to some extent, it was when the federal government started impinging on them, creating

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:25.060
[Guest]: antitrust laws, restricting their ability to get employees from overseas, restricting

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:28.820
[Guest]: their ability to buy and sell overseas through tariffs.

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:34.080
[Guest]: They needed to get involved in Washington to stop those unfortunate policies.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:40.040
[Guest]: And once you get into Washington, you can just get dragged into the rent-seeking economy

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.200
[Guest]: or what I call the parasite economy.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:51.320
[Guest]: You move from being entirely focused on serving customers to partially focused on what can

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:57.000
[Guest]: I get the government to do that will hurt my competitor and make it easier for me to

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
[Guest]: sell my product.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.680
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, the way I've always thought of markets is markets are the most efficient

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.560
[Amit Varma]: instrument by which people in society can fulfill each other's needs.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:12.060
[Amit Varma]: And yet, as you've pointed out in your book over a period of time, the term society has

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:17.600
[Amit Varma]: taken on a life of its own, where people actually think of society as a beast of its own, which

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:23.960
[Amit Varma]: is not, you know, like to us, society is just consisting of the individuals that compose

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.200
[Amit Varma]: it, nothing more and nothing less.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.800
[Amit Varma]: But there are different philosophies and ways of thinking that treat it as something special

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:36.520
[Amit Varma]: and that behave as if the needs of society must be met by the state itself.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:42.400
[Amit Varma]: And individuals voluntarily interacting among themselves are not capable of it.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:48.680
[Guest]: Well, that's right, the great human beings are social animals, very few of us want to

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:54.720
[Guest]: get stranded on a desert island or go out into the wilderness and live alone.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.760
[Guest]: We want to live in communities.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:04.360
[Guest]: We want to interact with other people, partly for the internal fulfillment that we get,

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:07.960
[Guest]: but partly also because if you go off in the wilderness and live alone, you're going to

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:12.440
[Guest]: be lucky to have a lean-to and rabbit every three days to eat.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:19.120
[Guest]: Whereas if you participate in society, you can have a varied diet and a pleasant home

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:24.480
[Guest]: and an easier job than trapping wild animals.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.880
[Guest]: And it's the market institutions that make that kind of social cooperation possible.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:35.000
[Guest]: So in that sense, libertarians are all for society.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.440
[Guest]: In fact, there's an argument that libertarians should have been called socialists because

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:48.960
[Guest]: we are for social power, for social interaction, not for the state, not for physical power.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:55.680
[Guest]: So really the two opposing philosophies are socialism and statism.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:00.560
[Guest]: We reject statism as a way of organizing society.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:04.920
[Guest]: We believe in social interaction.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:09.360
[Guest]: But obviously the word socialist has come to mean something else, so we can't do that.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:17.500
[Guest]: And we don't want to reify society, to make it a thing of which we are merely members.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:24.640
[Guest]: We all interact with people in ways that mostly, as adults at least, we get to choose.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.120
[Guest]: We can choose where we work.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.520
[Guest]: We can choose where we live.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:34.360
[Guest]: We can choose to have more or less relationship with our family, more or less involvement

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.400
[Guest]: in our neighborhoods.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.520
[Guest]: And through those things, we create society.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:47.480
[Guest]: But society is not an independent entity that should work with government to limit our freedom.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.480
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, there was a quote in your book from Hillary Clinton, which made me just laugh

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.600
[Amit Varma]: out loud.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.800
[Amit Varma]: And I presume the quote is from the 90s when she wrote, It Takes a Village, etc.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.080
[Amit Varma]: And the quote goes like this quote, Videos with scenes of common sense baby care, how

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:05.760
[Amit Varma]: to burp an infant, what to do when soap gets in his eyes, how to make a baby with an earache

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:10.040
[Amit Varma]: comfortable, could be running continuously on doctors offices, clinics, hospitals, motor

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.880
[Amit Varma]: vehicle offices, or any other place where people gather and have to wait.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.880
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.920
[Amit Varma]: And I imagine this was her vision for how the you know, the state would disseminate

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.040
[Amit Varma]: all this information to poor ignorant citizens who need it.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.320
[Amit Varma]: And I just thought of YouTube today that hey, we do that for ourselves.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:31.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, if I'm stuck doing any normal errand or trying to figure out some piece of electronics,

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:35.760
[Amit Varma]: or if I just want to figure out a new way of frying an egg, for God's sake, I can just

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.360
[Amit Varma]: go on YouTube or search for it or Instagram and so on.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.960
[Amit Varma]: And all of this is people disseminating knowledge to each other so beautifully.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:48.560
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, this is a market at work and contrast that with the clumsy, coercive approach

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:51.120
[Guest]: that you know, she laid out in her quote,

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:57.160
[Guest]: places where people have to wait, including government offices, where the where the people

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:01.960
[Guest]: running the offices don't care about the time of the people who are waiting.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.960
[Guest]: That's right.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.800
[Guest]: It was sort of a vision.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:05.800
[Guest]: Talk about this.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:11.840
[Guest]: You know, liberals want to be your mommy teaching you how to wipe your nose and running videos

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:12.840
[Guest]: about it.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:17.280
[Guest]: I've never looked for a YouTube video on how to birth a baby, but I'll bet there is one.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.280
[Guest]: In fact, there are probably many of them.

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.680
[Guest]: So we didn't need the government to do that.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.240
[Guest]: And it did feel creepy.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:31.320
[Guest]: It feels like 1984 that the government knows better than you do about everything.

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:37.160
[Guest]: And it will generously take your money and then produce videos telling you how to birth

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.160
[Amit Varma]: a baby.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.760
[Amit Varma]: And that is so repugnant.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.860
[Amit Varma]: And there's another great quote from your book, which I just want to read out because

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:50.320
[Amit Varma]: it's so reflective of the misconception that people have of individualism and society.

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, like you said, humans are social animals.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.360
[Amit Varma]: And the quote is quote, an individual is part of a family, a neighborhood, a city, a metropolitan

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.360
[Amit Varma]: area, a state, a nation.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.480
[Amit Varma]: But are the circles merely concentric?

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:07.800
[Amit Varma]: A better way to understand community in the modern world is as a series of intersecting

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:11.920
[Amit Varma]: circles with myriad complex connections among them.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:12.920
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.920
[Amit Varma]: And it's a beautiful quote.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:18.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, and the fact is that all of these circles are best organized and brought together

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.680
[Guest]: by voluntary action.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.000
[Guest]: Yes, that's right.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.200
[Guest]: And not everybody in my family is interested in the same activities that I am.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:29.160
[Guest]: Not everybody in my family lives in the same neighborhood.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:35.520
[Guest]: And you can sort of see in an earlier period when we lived in clans and villages, it sort

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.280
[Guest]: of was true that everyone in your family lives right around you and participates in the same

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:42.160
[Guest]: activities.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.840
[Guest]: Everyone in your family lives in the same village.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:49.000
[Guest]: Everyone in the village goes to the same church and so on and so on.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:57.040
[Guest]: But in a plural society, a modern liberal society, I don't have to go to the same church

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.040
[Guest]: as my brothers and sisters.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:04.920
[Guest]: I don't have to enjoy the same music that my parents do.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:09.400
[Guest]: I can go to libertarian conventions and nobody else in my family does.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:14.560
[Guest]: And a lot of the people in the libertarian conventions are listening to kinds of music

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:19.640
[Guest]: that I don't like, are following sports teams that I'm not interested in.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.640
[Guest]: All kinds of.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:26.320
[Guest]: And so in that sense, we're all forming many different connections with people.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:30.120
[Amit Varma]: And one of the core values of libertarianism, as you point out, is pluralism.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:34.700
[Amit Varma]: And you draw the distinction between moral pluralism versus perfection.

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:39.560
[Amit Varma]: And you point out that theocratic religions, Marxism, communitarian philosophers aim for

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.480
[Amit Varma]: perfection, to design a society according to the rules.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.240
[Amit Varma]: But we libertarians think of society differently.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.240
[Guest]: That's right.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.840
[Guest]: We believe in moral pluralism.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:54.040
[Guest]: We understand that moral pluralism exists and we're comfortable with that.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:59.160
[Guest]: There are a lot of people historically, and maybe even some today, who believe that a

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:06.800
[Guest]: society works best if everybody does follow the same values, the same philosophy, particularly

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.520
[Guest]: the same religion.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:14.720
[Guest]: A lot of people believe societies work best if everyone is of the same ethnic origin.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:22.340
[Guest]: And that is a sort of pre-modern attitude that we're a clan in a village, in a community

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:24.320
[Guest]: of our ethnic group.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:30.640
[Guest]: Whereas in a plural world, we understand that diversity has values, that we all have individual

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:36.280
[Guest]: interests that aren't necessarily the same as the people who are closest to us.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:41.840
[Guest]: And we've learned that societies can work perfectly well when people have different

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:50.200
[Guest]: religions, different races, different moral values, as long as those moral values don't

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:55.240
[Guest]: involve being able to impose your values on other people.

01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:02.160
[Guest]: Or at least we have social and political institutions that limit the ability of people to try to

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.480
[Guest]: impose their values on others.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:11.760
[Amit Varma]: And that's also sort of where moral pluralism is different from moral relativism, say, because

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.920
[Amit Varma]: all of this is subject to the sanctity of individual rights.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.280
[Amit Varma]: As long as you're not infringing on anyone's rights, you can do whatever.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.360
[Guest]: Yes, that's right.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:26.680
[Guest]: We do want a society where infringements of rights are punished.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:33.120
[Guest]: And in general, that means there is a court system, a system of police.

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:39.320
[Guest]: If you do hit me or take my stuff, that there will be some response to that.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:46.520
[Guest]: And that helps to create the rule of law where I can be reasonably secure in my person and

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:49.760
[Guest]: property as I go about my business.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.880
[Amit Varma]: Let's go back to some of the key concepts of libertarianism that you were talking about.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.640
[Amit Varma]: After individualism, you have individual rights, which we don't need to elaborate on.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:58.840
[Amit Varma]: We've already spoken about it.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.960
[Amit Varma]: And the third one you've listed down is spontaneous order.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.560
[Amit Varma]: I had an episode with Matt Ridley on the evolution of everything where we talk about essentially

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:12.640
[Amit Varma]: spontaneous order and markets and language.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:15.800
[Amit Varma]: That's the nature of nature in a manner of speaking.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:20.800
[Amit Varma]: Yet, as you also point out, one of the ironic downsides to progress was that you suddenly

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:25.800
[Amit Varma]: had an outgrowth of engineers and planners who had the arrogance and the fatal conceit,

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:31.080
[Amit Varma]: as it were, to believe that just as they could design a machine or an assembly line, they

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.160
[Guest]: could also design society.

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:39.720
[Guest]: It's a natural instinct, because we all know that achieving some of our purposes requires

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.400
[Guest]: planning in order.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:47.120
[Guest]: It may be as simple as setting a time that you get up, that you get your children up,

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.160
[Guest]: that you serve your children breakfast, that you get your children to the bus stop so they

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.240
[Guest]: can go to school.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:58.220
[Guest]: That kind of planning creates order and creates benefits.

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:02.280
[Guest]: In order to organize a conference, you have to do a lot of planning.

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:06.000
[Guest]: To organize a business, you have to do even more planning.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.080
[Guest]: And it requires rules and cooperation and so on.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:16.120
[Guest]: What a lot of people, and maybe particularly intellectuals, don't understand is that the

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:22.480
[Guest]: biggest institutions in society are too complex to be planned.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:29.000
[Guest]: We have air traffic control at every airport regulating when airplanes take off.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:36.340
[Guest]: But it would be a much more complex thing to try to regulate all the movements of automobiles

01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:38.240
[Guest]: in a metropolitan area.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.920
[Guest]: There, we rely on a few simple rules.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:45.280
[Guest]: There's a speed limit, stop at the red light, only turn right on red, you know, those kinds

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.280
[Guest]: of things.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:49.960
[Guest]: And that creates a reasonable degree of order.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:56.840
[Guest]: So sometimes businessmen and engineers who have been planning in their businesses assume

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.680
[Guest]: that the whole country would be better off if somebody was planning it.

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:06.320
[Guest]: And sometimes intellectuals who have no conception of business think planning is just a matter

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:11.720
[Guest]: of somebody issuing orders, and they believe that we could order the whole society.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.280
[Guest]: Look how much inefficiency there is in the market.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:19.840
[Guest]: Food gets wasted, clothing is produced that nobody actually wants.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.400
[Guest]: There are some houses that are not occupied, and there are people who don't have houses.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.360
[Guest]: Surely a plan could fix all this.

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:33.060
[Guest]: What they don't understand is that the most complex institutions in society have been

01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:34.840
[Guest]: unplanned.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.360
[Guest]: Language is an example.

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.720
[Guest]: Language evolves.

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:44.920
[Guest]: Nobody sat down and wrote the English language and then froze it in 1590 or 1780 or anything.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.960
[Guest]: It evolves all the time.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:50.560
[Guest]: Law is also a spontaneous order.

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:55.200
[Guest]: Law starts with your tree fell on my property.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.520
[Guest]: Who's responsible for the damage?

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:00.720
[Guest]: And people went to others to settle their disputes.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:04.720
[Guest]: Some of the people who were good at settling disputes became known as judges.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.200
[Guest]: We built up this precedent, and eventually the government got involved and it started

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.840
[Guest]: codifying all of this and writing it down in laws.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:21.400
[Guest]: But to the extent that the government is writing laws as opposed to simply codifying what these

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:27.240
[Guest]: decisions have amounted to, it's actually interfering in the spontaneous development

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.240
[Guest]: of law.

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:35.120
[Guest]: And then in the economy, the order emerges out of individual actions every day.

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:39.600
[Guest]: Every one of us gets up wanting to improve our own lives and our families' lives, and

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.600
[Guest]: we make choices.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:46.120
[Guest]: We bake bread, we buy bread, we go to a job, we look for a new job, we go door to door

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:50.040
[Guest]: selling something, we manufacture things.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:56.440
[Guest]: And the market system and the price system make all of those things work to create win-win

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.840
[Guest]: solutions across the whole society.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:04.600
[Guest]: And if you try to plan that, you will, among other things, get a lot less output.

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.920
[Amit Varma]: No, and there's a great essay by Leonard Reed called I Pencil, which I'll link from the

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:14.840
[Amit Varma]: episode page, which really shows what a miraculous thing a pencil is and what it takes to produce

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:15.840
[Amit Varma]: it.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, no government or committee would be able to do it, but the market miraculously

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.520
[Amit Varma]: does it in the same way as everyone in the housing colony where I live get the breakfast

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.520
[Amit Varma]: they want every morning.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:29.920
[Amit Varma]: And yet if some one person was, or one committee was to plan and figure out everyone's needs

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:32.520
[Amit Varma]: and figure out supply and demand, it would never happen.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:37.200
[Amit Varma]: You touched on law in this, and really your fourth key concept of libertarianism, which

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.160
[Amit Varma]: I want to talk about is the rule of law.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:43.080
[Amit Varma]: And at one hand, obviously, you know, people who have a very simplistic notion of what

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:47.800
[Amit Varma]: libertarians want often say that, no, it'll just be anarchy if everyone's free to do whatever.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:48.800
[Amit Varma]: And that's not the case.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:52.880
[Amit Varma]: And one has to explain to them that no, we believe in the rule of law, very strongly

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:59.240
[Amit Varma]: you need a rule of law, but even within that, there are nuances as to what law really means

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:03.800
[Amit Varma]: and how it is different from edicts, as you point out in your book.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:04.800
[Guest]: Well that's right.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:10.040
[Guest]: And as I was saying, I think the origins of law were that people had conflicts.

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:15.320
[Guest]: And once they figured out that it was better to try to resolve them peacefully, then they

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:21.800
[Guest]: started developing precedents on who's responsible if my tree falls on your property and what

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:26.160
[Guest]: should happen if I can prove that you stole something of mine.

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:33.720
[Guest]: And so we developed institutions like police and courts, fines, imprisonment, but also

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:40.720
[Guest]: when we say the rule of law, we mean that the law is clear and available to all and

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.160
[Guest]: applies to every person equally.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:50.440
[Guest]: And it's not arbitrary and it doesn't provide special rules for some classes of people,

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:55.560
[Guest]: some races of people, or some groups like the ruling class.

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:59.580
[Guest]: There's a lot of criticism in the United States today that president Trump is threatening

01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:00.760
[Guest]: the rule of law.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:05.840
[Guest]: This is true of many presidents up to a point.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.240
[Guest]: But when we say rule of law in that case, what we mean is there are laws that are either

01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:18.160
[Guest]: evolved by courts or written down by legislators, and they provide that everybody plays by the

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.160
[Guest]: same rules.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:22.120
[Guest]: The tax rate is the same for everyone.

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.240
[Guest]: The contracts are enforced for everyone.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:31.760
[Guest]: And when government decides to violate that by helping one company over another, by hurting

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:38.520
[Guest]: one industry rather than another, by handing out contracts to friends of the president

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:43.640
[Guest]: or the governor or the mayor, all of those things are violations of the rule of law.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:50.800
[Guest]: The expectation that each one of us is equal in the eyes of the law and will be equally

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:52.320
[Guest]: treated by our government.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:20:00.240
[Amit Varma]: And the fact that we often treat the quote unquote laws that legislators put together

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:05.200
[Amit Varma]: as sacred is sometimes a problem because, you know, as Hayek would say, they're edicts

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.720
[Amit Varma]: rather than laws.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.800
[Amit Varma]: And you know, like you say, that where they breach the principle of treating everyone

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.760
[Amit Varma]: equally, it becomes a problem.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:18.920
[Amit Varma]: For example, I like to say that all government regulations, wherever the government regulates

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:25.160
[Amit Varma]: a free market, it's essentially a redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:28.760
[Amit Varma]: You know, not the other way around, but from the poor to the rich, because they always

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:33.240
[Amit Varma]: hurt the people at large and they benefit specific interest groups.

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:38.160
[Amit Varma]: And it's no one's yet given me an example of a regulation on free markets, which don't

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.760
[Amit Varma]: do exactly this.

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.960
[Amit Varma]: And yet regulations grow and grow.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:46.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, in your book, you write, quote, The total code of federal regulations is now

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:52.520
[Amit Varma]: over one hundred and seventy five thousand pages in two hundred and thirty eight volumes.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:53.520
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.520
[Amit Varma]: Are regulations law?

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.080
[Amit Varma]: Are they part of the rule of law?

01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:03.640
[Guest]: Well, there may be some kinds of regulations that actually regulate the way we treat one

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.640
[Guest]: another.

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:11.400
[Guest]: Environmental regulations may require that externalities and public goods be taken into

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.400
[Guest]: account.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.840
[Guest]: But on the whole, your discussion of regulation is right.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:23.480
[Guest]: And what I noticed was you're correct to say regulations typically benefit the rich and

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:25.120
[Guest]: well connected.

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.840
[Guest]: And you said and yet they continue to increase.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.960
[Guest]: Well, there's no paradox there.

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:34.240
[Guest]: They continue to increase because there are special interests that benefit from them.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.800
[Guest]: That's why they want them.

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:42.400
[Guest]: So, yes, we are constantly fighting for the public interest against special interests

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.000
[Guest]: that want particular kinds of regulation.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.240
[Guest]: I remember some years ago, a lot of people didn't like smoking in restaurants.

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:56.880
[Guest]: And one day, McDonald's, the biggest restaurant chain in America, announced that it would

01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:03.080
[Guest]: no longer allow smoking in its restaurants and it wanted a law to ban smoking in all

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.080
[Guest]: fast food restaurants.

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:05.080
[Guest]: Well, why?

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:08.040
[Guest]: If you're going to eliminate smoking in your restaurant, why do you need a law that will

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.040
[Guest]: tell you that?

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:14.480
[Guest]: Well, I suspect what they worried about was that some people want to go to fast food restaurants

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.900
[Guest]: and smoke.

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:22.160
[Guest]: And so by creating a law, they would avoid giving an economic advantage to any of their

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:26.320
[Guest]: competitors in attracting the custom of smokers.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:33.840
[Guest]: So many laws that seem to have a public interest basis are, in fact, benefiting some special

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.920
[Guest]: interests.

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:39.560
[Guest]: And that is a significant factor in their being passed.

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:44.800
[Amit Varma]: And that actually comes to the crux of one of the problems that we face, one of the sort

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:50.640
[Amit Varma]: of big obstacles in this liberty versus power battle, which is that, you know, as public

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:55.880
[Amit Varma]: choice theory points out, there is an interplay between money and power because people in

01:22:55.880 --> 01:23:00.780
[Amit Varma]: government because government is not a monolithic benevolent beast which just does what it's

01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:01.780
[Amit Varma]: supposed to.

01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:07.600
[Amit Varma]: It consists of people who, just like people anywhere else, respond to incentives.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:14.680
[Amit Varma]: And those incentives are tailored always towards maximizing their own power and their own budgets,

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:19.240
[Amit Varma]: which is why, you know, Jefferson, for example, famously said, quote, The natural progress

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:23.440
[Amit Varma]: of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.440
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.440
[Amit Varma]: It is grounds for despair.

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:28.400
[Guest]: Well, it is grounds for concern.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.920
[Guest]: In some sense, it is the reality of the world.

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.720
[Guest]: It's the reality we have to deal with.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:41.000
[Guest]: Compared to long ago, we have done a pretty good job of creating social institutions that

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.840
[Guest]: restrain rent seeking and special interest seeking and so on.

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:50.240
[Guest]: But we certainly haven't done a perfect job of it.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:56.600
[Guest]: And as our societies get wealthier, there's a lot more wealth that could be redistributed.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:03.080
[Guest]: So even though we're all richer than we used to be, there can be more redistribution because

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:06.480
[Guest]: there's so much money available.

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:10.440
[Guest]: So yes, it is a constant challenge.

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:17.880
[Guest]: And you can read public choice economics and come away despairing because it suggests that

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:25.200
[Guest]: principles and public interests are not very important and everybody is out to get something

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.720
[Guest]: from the government.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.960
[Guest]: On the other hand, public choice economists have sometimes asked, why is there so little

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.760
[Guest]: rent seeking?

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:41.200
[Guest]: If you look at the amount of money that is spent to influence the federal budget, what

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:42.200
[Guest]: is it?

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.840
[Guest]: Five billion dollars spent on a presidential campaign, maybe that much more on congressional

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.320
[Guest]: campaigns.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:55.760
[Guest]: Maybe there's five billion dollars a year spent on lobbying and activist organizations

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:58.120
[Guest]: and even think tanks.

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:02.720
[Guest]: That's still not very much compared to the four trillion dollar federal budget.

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:08.680
[Guest]: So it seems that we do have some institutional structures that make it difficult to get what

01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:16.040
[Guest]: you want from government and still some social norms that there's a limit to how blatant

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:20.160
[Guest]: you can be in asking for help from the government.

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:26.640
[Guest]: Now part of what those social norms mean is that there's work for articulate people who

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:35.680
[Guest]: can come up with good public rationales for the thing I want to do just to hurt my competitors.

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:42.080
[Guest]: So you say, we don't want America to be at the mercy of foreign suppliers of important

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.080
[Guest]: goods.

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:49.160
[Guest]: What I really mean is my company producing military uniforms here in the United States

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.760
[Guest]: is not very cost efficient.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:57.800
[Guest]: And I know that if we have free trade, we will buy military uniforms from China.

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:01.320
[Guest]: But I can say, oh, that's bad for our national security.

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.400
[Guest]: What if we got in a war?

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.960
[Guest]: Our soldiers would have to go naked because we can't import our uniforms anymore.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.600
[Guest]: So that will persuade people.

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:13.480
[Guest]: Oh, yes, we should require that the military uniforms be made in the United States.

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:19.680
[Guest]: The reason that somebody wanted to do that was because they wanted to make a profit.

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:26.040
[Guest]: But they've paid articulate lawyers and advertising managers to come up with an argument that

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:29.120
[Guest]: sounds like it benefits the public.

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:38.040
[Guest]: Still in the modern Western economies, most resources are still allocated by the market,

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:41.080
[Guest]: by people's choices in the marketplace.

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:48.000
[Guest]: And that's why, despite the size of government, we do continue to be better off every year.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.080
[Guest]: We have our houses are a little bigger.

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.320
[Guest]: Our houses are a little warmer.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.560
[Guest]: We have iPhones instead of the old fashioned phone on the wall at home.

01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:03.800
[Guest]: All those improvements keep happening because we have come up with institutions that constrain

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:07.400
[Guest]: the special interests, even though they don't eliminate them.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:11.840
[Amit Varma]: I'd been a guest on an episode of another podcast called the Pragati Podcast, which

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.660
[Amit Varma]: dealt with the public choice theory, which will be linked from the episode page.

01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:21.600
[Amit Varma]: But I'd like to share a very revelatory story about how the state never decreases in size

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.600
[Amit Varma]: or never seems to decrease in size with you and my listeners.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.480
[Amit Varma]: Have you ever heard of an Indian government department called the CCA?

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.160
[Amit Varma]: No, I don't think so.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.920
[Amit Varma]: Okay, you got to listen to this one.

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:34.680
[Amit Varma]: So and I got this from a book by Vivek Debroy to give credit where it's due.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:39.520
[Amit Varma]: So in 1984, a government department in the government of Tamil Nadu, which is a South

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:44.640
[Amit Varma]: Indian state applied to higher up authorities for an increase in its budget.

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:50.280
[Amit Varma]: So the secretary on whose table this landed decided to investigate and find out what exactly

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:53.360
[Amit Varma]: the CCA was and what it did.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:57.520
[Amit Varma]: And the story of it goes back to the Second World War and to Winston Churchill.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:02.020
[Amit Varma]: So Churchill was a big fan of cigars and he got all his cigars from Cuba.

01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:06.400
[Amit Varma]: And when the Second World War started, his supply of cigars dried up.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:12.520
[Amit Varma]: So he went to what was then the second best, according to him, cigar manufacturer around

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:16.920
[Amit Varma]: or the best which was available to him, which was in a place near what was then Madras and

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.640
[Amit Varma]: is now Chennai in Tamil Nadu.

01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:26.000
[Amit Varma]: So a government department was set up to procure those cigars for him, because India was still

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.080
[Amit Varma]: part of the British Empire then and send it to him over in London until the war got over.

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:36.080
[Amit Varma]: And that department was called CCA Churchill Cigar Assistant.

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:42.560
[Amit Varma]: And the war gets over, India gets freedom, Winston Churchill dies, all these years pass,

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:43.560
[Amit Varma]: 40 years pass.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:48.640
[Amit Varma]: And in 1984, you still have this department with the audacity to ask for an increase in

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.640
[Amit Varma]: its budget.

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:53.640
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, this was one of the rare cases when the department was actually shut down.

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:56.760
[Amit Varma]: But it took almost 40 years for that to happen.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:00.080
[Guest]: Well, we've had examples like that in the United States.

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:07.600
[Guest]: We had a tea tasters board, a group of government employees who tasted all the tea that was

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:12.600
[Guest]: sold to make sure that it was made properly, I guess.

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.880
[Guest]: And it stayed around for 100 years.

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.800
[Guest]: I think we did finally get rid of it.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.760
[Guest]: There were also mohair subsidies.

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.440
[Guest]: This is a kind of wool.

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:25.760
[Guest]: And I believe that goes back to making uniforms in World War I.

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.080
[Guest]: And here it is.

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:33.000
[Guest]: In the 1980s, they tried to get rid of it, but it came back because the mohair suppliers

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.720
[Guest]: continue to lobby Congress.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:39.280
[Guest]: Every manufacturer, every producer has a lobby in Washington.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:45.680
[Guest]: The problem is consumers and taxpayers don't have much of a lobby because their interests

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.440
[Guest]: are very diffuse.

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:55.040
[Guest]: But whatever you do for a living, whether it's making shoes or making cigars or creating

01:29:55.040 --> 01:30:02.480
[Guest]: insurance, you have a lobby to protect your interest in your livelihood.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:08.240
[Guest]: And that lobby is here in Washington, always making sure that there are no threats to your

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.200
[Guest]: subsidy or your protection.

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:11.200
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:15.080
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, we've already spoken for one and a half hours and you promised me two hours

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.560
[Amit Varma]: and I've still got pages and pages of notes left.

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:21.200
[Amit Varma]: So I don't want to go much beyond the two hours you promised me.

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.640
[Amit Varma]: Maybe we'll save it for another episode.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:27.440
[Amit Varma]: So I'll just skip to, you know, rather than just the two of us sort of agreeing with each

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:29.480
[Amit Varma]: other and so on and so forth.

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:34.920
[Amit Varma]: I thought it's fair for our listeners to bring up some sort of tough questions which libertarians

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:40.680
[Amit Varma]: typically get and which I'm really used to getting and check out your responses to them.

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.160
[Amit Varma]: So I'll begin with some of them.

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:48.660
[Amit Varma]: One of the questions I often get is that, look, libertarianism is so utopian.

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:51.780
[Amit Varma]: You know, is there a free market economy anywhere in the world?

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:53.840
[Amit Varma]: Why is there no libertarian state anywhere?

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:58.960
[Guest]: Well, you know, the world is a complex place and we've talked throughout this about reasons

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:04.560
[Guest]: that people oppose liberty or reasons that people don't oppose liberty, but they do want

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.440
[Guest]: little twists in it to benefit themselves.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:13.040
[Guest]: So they did try a pure communist economy once and it was such a disaster.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.820
[Guest]: They never did it again.

01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:20.720
[Guest]: Is there a American conservatives often say there's no pure libertarian country?

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:25.080
[Guest]: Well, there's no pure conservative country, whatever that would mean.

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:32.840
[Guest]: What we do know is that after liberalism arose around 1700, England, the Netherlands, the

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:39.200
[Guest]: United States, eventually most of Europe, later much of the world moved in the direction

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:42.120
[Guest]: of liberalism or libertarianism.

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:45.160
[Guest]: And when they did, the results were good.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:51.880
[Guest]: The richest countries in the world were the ones that followed the precepts of libertarianism

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:53.440
[Guest]: the most closely.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:32:00.200
[Guest]: But it's a complex world and no, we never got rid of all intrusions into people's lives.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:06.500
[Guest]: And liberalism or libertarianism is an unfolding idea.

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:13.120
[Guest]: It took a long time in the United States to convince Americans that all men are created

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:18.680
[Guest]: equal really meant all men, not to mention all women, and that black people should not

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:22.860
[Guest]: be treated the way they had been at the time of the Declaration of Independence.

01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:26.200
[Guest]: So that was an advance toward freedom.

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:33.440
[Guest]: And later we said women also are adults who should be equal in their rights and responsibilities.

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:39.520
[Guest]: And much later, gay people were identified as people whose rights were being violated

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.800
[Guest]: by government.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:48.440
[Guest]: And so in a lot of ways, we have continued to move toward recognition of equal liberty

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:53.800
[Guest]: and the removal of all the constraints of mercantilism and everything.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:58.080
[Guest]: And meanwhile, there's a battle with people who want to impose new constraints.

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:04.200
[Guest]: But I do think I could tell you to go look at the Economic Freedom of the World Report

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:09.920
[Guest]: and see which countries have the most economic freedom and how well their economies are doing.

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:15.680
[Guest]: But I think people know that around the world, the more economic freedom there is, generally

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:20.840
[Guest]: the more other kinds of freedom, personal and political freedom you will see, and the

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:24.840
[Guest]: more economic growth and economic output you get.

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:31.800
[Guest]: And that's why around the world, the flows of immigration are to freer countries from

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:33.720
[Guest]: less free countries.

01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:41.120
[Guest]: You don't generally see very many people trying to sneak in from Europe to China.

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:45.360
[Guest]: China has become a much better place than it used to be, but you still don't find people

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:49.600
[Guest]: coming from freer countries to try to sneak into it.

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:50.800
[Guest]: People vote with their feet.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.120
[Guest]: They vote for freedom.

01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:59.440
[Guest]: We don't have perfectly libertarian societies, but we have much more free societies in a

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.900
[Guest]: lot of places than we used to.

01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:03.440
[Amit Varma]: And also nothing is a pernicious.

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:06.680
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, I think there can be no such thing as a perfect world.

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:10.960
[Amit Varma]: So the question for any individual should be not do you want to make the world perfect,

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:15.280
[Amit Varma]: which ain't ever going to happen, but do you want to make the world a little better off?

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.680
[Amit Varma]: And as you pointed out, if you make it freer, you do indeed make it a little better off.

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:26.720
[Amit Varma]: Another question I have for you is, A, what do you think of the welfare state?

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:28.440
[Amit Varma]: And B, what do you have to say?

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:30.440
[Amit Varma]: And I get this a lot here in India.

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:36.320
[Amit Varma]: What do you have to say about the apparent success of the welfare states of Scandinavian

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.760
[Amit Varma]: in making the lives of the citizens better off?

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:41.440
[Guest]: Well, that's an interesting question.

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:48.460
[Guest]: I do believe that the welfare state, which means taxing people and taking money and transferring

01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:53.040
[Guest]: it to other people, is a violation of people's rights.

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:58.880
[Guest]: And I also believe it's not a good way to make social progress.

01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:05.520
[Guest]: We'll talk about the success of the Scandinavian countries, some other Western European countries.

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:10.880
[Guest]: There's no question those countries have been very successful of all the countries and eras

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.040
[Guest]: in the history of the world.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:19.680
[Guest]: There aren't many that you would choose to live in over the social democracies of Western

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.120
[Guest]: Europe.

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:26.080
[Guest]: But the question is, did they become great places to live because they had large welfare

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:31.560
[Guest]: states, or did they develop large welfare states because they had already become such

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:36.400
[Guest]: good places to live that they had more money available to do things like that?

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:42.240
[Guest]: I just heard a talk from my Swedish colleague, Johan Norberg, about Sweden.

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:48.320
[Guest]: What happened in Sweden in the 1960s and 1970s when I was growing up, everybody said Sweden

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:49.320
[Guest]: is perfect.

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:51.160
[Guest]: Sweden is the perfect welfare state.

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:52.160
[Guest]: No one is poor.

01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:57.080
[Guest]: The Swedish model, that was what we all were supposed to aspire to.

01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.680
[Guest]: Follow the Swedish model.

01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:03.400
[Guest]: Johan will tell you, Sweden was one of the earliest and most capitalist countries in

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.400
[Guest]: the world.

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:07.960
[Guest]: It became one of the richest countries in the world.

01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:15.760
[Guest]: Starting around 1960, it did have an ideological change such that people said, hey, we have

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.120
[Guest]: all this money.

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.200
[Guest]: We should be able to eliminate poverty.

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:23.000
[Guest]: And they tried that for about a generation.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:28.880
[Guest]: And in the past 20 years or so, they have realized it was too expensive.

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.840
[Guest]: It was hurting the Swedish work ethic.

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:33.080
[Guest]: It was hurting Swedish economic growth.

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:38.200
[Guest]: It was causing well-off people to leave Sweden to avoid their taxes.

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:42.280
[Guest]: And they have reined in their taxes and their welfare programs.

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:44.120
[Guest]: So they haven't gotten rid of them.

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:47.480
[Guest]: But they did realize they had gone too far.

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:52.240
[Guest]: And to some extent, that's true in Denmark and other places like that.

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:58.800
[Guest]: So there's no question that we're finding out you can maintain a welfare state and still

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.960
[Guest]: have a good society.

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:08.960
[Guest]: In my view, if you had much lower taxes and therefore much less transfer payment systems,

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.840
[Guest]: you would have more economic growth.

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.400
[Guest]: There would be more wealth to go around in society.

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:17.960
[Guest]: There would be more and better jobs for people.

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:23.920
[Guest]: And I would take a look at all the ways that the government makes it difficult for poor

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.960
[Guest]: people to succeed.

01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:31.920
[Guest]: It has, at least in the United States, it has criminal laws such as drug prohibition

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:38.920
[Guest]: that dramatically increase incarceration and police presence in poor neighborhoods.

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:44.520
[Guest]: It has schools that are monopolized by the government and are much worse in areas where

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:48.160
[Guest]: people don't have much political power than they are in other places.

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:53.640
[Guest]: If we had a system of competing schools, people could choose what school to go to.

01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:57.240
[Guest]: Poor people could get better schools for their children.

01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:59.600
[Guest]: Welfare tends to trap people in poverty.

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:02.020
[Guest]: That's a problem we don't think about.

01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:07.040
[Guest]: But if you're on welfare and your kids grow up on welfare and then they go on welfare,

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:09.520
[Guest]: I don't think those are very fulfilling lives.

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:11.720
[Guest]: And I think we should worry about that.

01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:18.240
[Guest]: And we should try to find ways to help people become self-sufficient and make their own

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:24.280
[Guest]: way in the world with a sense of accomplishment rather than depending on government.

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:28.480
[Amit Varma]: And since you mentioned taxes, there's a great quote from your book on taxes as well, which

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:32.200
[Amit Varma]: is apart from the obvious moral cost and the violence involved, what's wrong with them

01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:33.200
[Amit Varma]: like consequentially?

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.240
[Amit Varma]: And your quote is, quote, if taxes were lower, there would be more money in the private sector

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:44.160
[Amit Varma]: being directed to the satisfaction of consumer demand and more demand for workers and thus

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:45.160
[Amit Varma]: less unemployment.

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:46.160
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:51.720
[Amit Varma]: And I think one of the issues with Scandinavia is like you said, that they got to the level

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:56.080
[Amit Varma]: of prosperity they got to because of free markets and capitalism.

01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:01.880
[Amit Varma]: And then when they did shift to becoming welfare states of the sort, which they became, you

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.240
[Amit Varma]: didn't have the counterfactual.

01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:07.600
[Amit Varma]: Firstly, you didn't have the counterfactual of what would have happened if they hadn't

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.000
[Amit Varma]: become welfare states.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.120
[Amit Varma]: And secondly, because they were already so prosperous, it didn't seem like anything bad

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.120
[Amit Varma]: happened at all.

01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:17.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there was still such great places to live in.

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:18.320
[Guest]: Well, that's right.

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:23.480
[Guest]: And I think you do have something of a counterfactual in the United States, having a smaller welfare

01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:30.000
[Guest]: state than the Western European countries and having outstripped them in terms of economic

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.520
[Guest]: growth and employment.

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:38.360
[Guest]: European countries have had very high unemployment rates by American standards and youth unemployment

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.860
[Guest]: rates particularly high.

01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:46.520
[Guest]: So they're good societies, but I don't believe it's a result of their high level of taxes

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:47.520
[Guest]: and transfers.

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:53.880
[Guest]: I think that's a drag on the prosperity that Europe could have and the jobs it could have

01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:54.880
[Guest]: available.

01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:01.840
[Amit Varma]: So my next question moves from the Scandinavian countries to America itself and recent events.

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:04.640
[Amit Varma]: Now, both you and I agreed that free trade is great.

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:08.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, every trade that takes place makes both parties better off.

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:11.560
[Amit Varma]: It's a positive sum game and countries aren't really trading with each other as individuals

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:13.320
[Amit Varma]: within countries who trade with each other.

01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:17.240
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you know, the balance of trade is not something we should ever worry about.

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:21.960
[Amit Varma]: But what's happened recently is because America in the past had embraced free trade to the

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:29.440
[Amit Varma]: extent that it did, what ended up happening was that the argument goes that the middle

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:35.960
[Amit Varma]: class in large parts of America saw their jobs being replaced by cheaper labor and cheaper

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:39.880
[Amit Varma]: goods from China and, you know, other Asian countries.

01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:44.440
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, while the individuals trading did benefit, you had large parts of middle

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:48.480
[Amit Varma]: America with jobs were lost or stagnated or middle class wages didn't really grow the

01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:53.720
[Amit Varma]: way they should have, which led to a lot of resentment among those people and them asking

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:56.520
[Amit Varma]: that, listen, what is this free trade nonsense?

01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:57.960
[Amit Varma]: We are not benefiting from it.

01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:59.520
[Amit Varma]: So what are you talking about?

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.760
[Amit Varma]: And the result of that is Donald Trump, who's starting these infernal trade wars, which,

01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, I worry that India might also join in playing that negative sum game.

01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:13.760
[Amit Varma]: But what do you say to those people in middle America who feel like that?

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:21.760
[Guest]: Well, the basic point is that getting more output from fewer people is the definition

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:23.040
[Guest]: of economic growth.

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:26.440
[Guest]: There was a time when 80 percent of Americans were farmers.

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:29.840
[Guest]: As late as 1900, I think it was around 50 percent.

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.720
[Guest]: Now less than 2 percent of Americans are farmers.

01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:35.760
[Amit Varma]: It's 50 percent in India, by the way, I should tell you.

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:36.760
[Amit Varma]: OK.

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:39.720
[Guest]: And as you get richer, it will be less.

01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:47.120
[Guest]: And so some people will say this market economy of yours is destroying jobs for farmers.

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:49.480
[Guest]: And that's true.

01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:55.560
[Guest]: But the fact is, because we can now produce enough food for all Americans with only about

01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:00.880
[Guest]: one and a half percent of Americans producing it, that means other Americans are freed up

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:04.080
[Guest]: to do other things that are more productive.

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:10.160
[Guest]: And initially, that mostly perhaps meant moving from the farm to the factory and manufacturing

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:11.160
[Guest]: things.

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:13.320
[Guest]: But now manufacturing has gotten more efficient.

01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:19.040
[Guest]: A lot of the decline in manufacturing jobs is because technology has gotten more sophisticated.

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:25.160
[Guest]: But some of it is that it turns out there are workers in India and China and other parts

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:31.480
[Guest]: of the world who at this point in development work for less money than American workers.

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:37.440
[Guest]: And that means that American consumers can buy things for less and have more money left

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:38.520
[Guest]: out.

01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:44.400
[Guest]: So it's just wrong to think that free trade has hurt the American economy.

01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:50.560
[Guest]: It is true that if you had a good paying job as an auto worker or a steel worker and you

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:56.840
[Guest]: lost that because either the factory got more efficient or factories were built in China

01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:01.960
[Guest]: and Mexico and so on, then you may very well have been hurt by that.

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:07.960
[Guest]: But the overall gains are substantial and your children are going to be better off.

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:09.280
[Guest]: They're going to get better jobs.

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:13.760
[Guest]: You know, working in a coal mine, a lot of people don't think that's such a great job.

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:22.240
[Guest]: Working on an assembly line, hard work, honest work, but probably not as pleasant a job as

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:24.120
[Guest]: a lot of jobs today.

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:34.040
[Guest]: So we're moving toward jobs and careers that are less demanding, less backbreaking than

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:36.880
[Guest]: farming was, than manufacturing was.

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:38.760
[Guest]: And that's all a good thing.

01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:44.920
[Guest]: But it is true any business that fails is going to throw some people out of work.

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:49.640
[Guest]: If I own a restaurant and it just turns out it can't get enough customers and it goes

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:54.840
[Guest]: out of business, well, then I may have lost my investment and I don't have a job anymore

01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:56.760
[Guest]: and other people don't have a job.

01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:04.880
[Guest]: But the dynamic process of constantly pressing to serve consumers in the best way is what

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:13.500
[Guest]: creates moving from the standard of living of 1900 to 1950 to 2000 to what we have today.

01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:20.440
[Guest]: And if you try to freeze it at any point, you will freeze yourself in to stagnation

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:21.440
[Guest]: at best.

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:26.560
[Guest]: So, yes, free trade is good for the whole society.

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:28.760
[Guest]: It's good for the whole world.

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:33.960
[Guest]: It is a bad thing that we have a president whose stock of economic knowledge, who is

01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:40.700
[Guest]: not just ignorant of economics, is worse than ignorant because he holds tenaciously to ideas

01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:42.100
[Amit Varma]: that are wrong.

01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:47.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, this brings me naturally to sort of the next section, which is a bunch

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:53.100
[Amit Varma]: of questions I want to ask you about the challenges libertarians face and libertarian ideas face

01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:55.280
[Amit Varma]: in general.

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:59.080
[Amit Varma]: And you know, like you pointed out, Trump is a man with very simplistic views of the

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:03.280
[Amit Varma]: world, but his simplistic narratives sell because people are drawn to simplistic narratives.

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:07.840
[Amit Varma]: So if an autoworker in Middle America has lost a job and he tells him and he says that,

01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:12.080
[Amit Varma]: oh, okay, outsourcing is bad because your job got shipped overseas, or immigration is

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.520
[Amit Varma]: bad because some foreigner came and took it.

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Those are intuitive and simple narratives which are wrong, but which have a certain

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.100
[Amit Varma]: appeal there.

01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:25.520
[Amit Varma]: And our challenges, a lot of the truths which we have discussed in this episode, the positive

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:29.640
[Amit Varma]: some nature of game that for, you know, if you and I trade, both of us can be better

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:36.580
[Amit Varma]: off for me to win, you don't have to lose or say spontaneous order are so counterintuitive.

01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:40.080
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you've been someone who's been in a think tank for so long.

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:46.760
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, part of what you've sort of a challenge that you must have faced is disseminating

01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:51.000
[Amit Varma]: these ideas and making them part of the discourse and common wisdom.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.480
[Amit Varma]: But is that a difficult thing to do, given how incredibly counterintuitive they are and

01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:57.520
[Amit Varma]: how they run counter to our instincts?

01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.560
[Guest]: Well, yes, it's a challenge.

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:06.200
[Guest]: There are some simple ideas that at least in America, I think are widely held and correct,

01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:10.640
[Guest]: you know, people have a right to live their lives any way they want to, as long as they

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:12.400
[Guest]: don't violate the equal rights of others.

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:15.520
[Guest]: I think Americans believe that.

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:19.040
[Guest]: It's just the application that can be difficult.

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:23.160
[Guest]: But it is a line you can use on an election platform.

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:26.000
[Guest]: Ronald Reagan talked that way.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.760
[Guest]: And he gave speeches that people liked and he got elected.

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:32.240
[Guest]: So yes, a lot of the ideas are counterintuitive.

01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:37.720
[Guest]: And so we have to constantly be explaining why it will not help low income workers to

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:44.120
[Guest]: set a minimum wage for their work, why it will not help the housing crisis in America

01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:47.640
[Guest]: to put caps on rents.

01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:55.560
[Guest]: All of these things are economics 101 and yet not easy to understand if you haven't

01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.880
[Guest]: been in an economics classroom.

01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:00.880
[Guest]: And that's why there is this constant process.

01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:03.240
[Guest]: But we have made progress at it.

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:08.000
[Guest]: The economic freedom of the world has been going up over the past 40 years as we've been

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.240
[Guest]: measuring it.

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:14.640
[Guest]: So as difficult as it is, we know that we can sell some of these ideas.

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:19.400
[Guest]: Currently at the Cato Institute, we're engaged in a project to explain to people the costs

01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:24.600
[Guest]: of the Jones Act, which says that anything shipped between two American ports must be

01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:26.680
[Guest]: on U.S. crewed ships.

01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:28.640
[Guest]: This is protectionism.

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:32.040
[Guest]: This is not good for American consumers.

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:34.280
[Guest]: We're going to try to explain that to people.

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.000
[Guest]: And there, the problem is not going to be explaining it.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.200
[Guest]: The problem is going to be the public choice problem, that the people who have the most

01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:48.560
[Guest]: influence over the policy are the ones who are out for their own good, not seeking the

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:49.960
[Guest]: public interest.

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:56.600
[Guest]: But yes, our challenge every day is to explain economic concepts in a way that people can

01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:02.800
[Guest]: understand and appreciate, even though there are simplistic demagogues of both right and

01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:05.680
[Amit Varma]: left arguing against them.

01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:10.280
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you and I and all libertarians are sort of belief passionately in the primacy

01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:12.800
[Amit Varma]: and the dignity of the individual.

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:17.060
[Amit Varma]: You know, as Ayn Rand once said, the smallest minority is the individual, stock quote.

01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:22.360
[Amit Varma]: And yet what has been happening recently is the rise of identity politics on both the

01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:27.560
[Amit Varma]: right and the left, which focus more on groups rather than individuals and group rights more

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.360
[Amit Varma]: than individual rights.

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.740
[Amit Varma]: Is this something that is disturbing?

01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:35.120
[Amit Varma]: And how can we counter it effectively?

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:41.080
[Guest]: It is disturbing, but I think conservatives sometimes are confused about the origins of

01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:42.080
[Guest]: it.

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:48.240
[Guest]: When you deny a certain group of people their equal liberty under law because they're part

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:53.640
[Guest]: of this group, like, for instance, the color of their skin or their religion or the fact

01:48:53.640 --> 01:49:02.040
[Guest]: that they are gay, then it's natural that they organize on behalf of women's rights

01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:03.960
[Guest]: or civil rights or gay rights.

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:07.520
[Guest]: And so that's a kind of identity politics.

01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:10.400
[Guest]: But they aren't the ones who created the identity.

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:15.320
[Guest]: It was the ruling class that said black people are a separate class.

01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:17.520
[Guest]: So who created identity politics?

01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:19.640
[Guest]: Well, arguably, white people did.

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:24.680
[Guest]: They said we rank higher than these other people.

01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:30.680
[Guest]: And so when the black people organized to defend their rights, some people said, you

01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:33.200
[Guest]: know, oh, you shouldn't organize on the basis of race.

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.120
[Guest]: Well, you organized us on the basis of race.

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:42.320
[Guest]: Now, I think we've gotten to a point in the United States where we have made great progress

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:48.920
[Guest]: in all of those areas, and now the emphasis on identity politics, I think, does drive

01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.640
[Guest]: us apart.

01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:56.680
[Guest]: And it is a problem on both right and left, and neither side sees that it is part of the

01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:57.680
[Guest]: problem.

01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:05.320
[Guest]: But we are getting a sort of white identity politics that pushes not just for equal rights,

01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:11.240
[Guest]: but for various kinds of prejudice and discrimination against other people.

01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:17.720
[Guest]: And then you have some of these marginalized or formerly marginalized groups insisting

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:28.520
[Guest]: on very detailed applications of their definition of identity and privilege and so on.

01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:30.720
[Guest]: So yes, it's very divisive.

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:35.720
[Guest]: And I think one of the biggest problems we have in the United States right now is this

01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:43.240
[Guest]: racial divisiveness that is being exacerbated by politicians and activists on both sides

01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:45.560
[Guest]: of the political spectrum.

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:48.440
[Amit Varma]: I have a couple of questions to end with.

01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:52.280
[Amit Varma]: And the first of those questions is a rather provocative question that I'm not sure I have

01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:53.520
[Amit Varma]: an answer for myself.

01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:56.640
[Amit Varma]: So let me, you know, see what you think of it.

01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:57.680
[Amit Varma]: And it's a two part question.

01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:00.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, and it's really a thought experiment.

01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:05.680
[Amit Varma]: Let's say that 40 years from now, 50 years from now, you know, AI grows to the extent

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:08.320
[Amit Varma]: that it is literally embedded in our brains.

01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:14.980
[Amit Varma]: And it's possible to sort of get information out of every human being not only to the extent

01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:19.240
[Amit Varma]: of what are their desires, what do they want, but also what they will want to have for breakfast

01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:20.240
[Amit Varma]: tomorrow.

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:21.240
[Amit Varma]: You can tell all that.

01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:22.600
[Amit Varma]: Let's say and this is a thought experiment.

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:27.000
[Amit Varma]: So you know, bear with me, let's say Hayek's knowledge problem is completely solved.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:33.240
[Amit Varma]: You can actually perfectly centrally plan a society because you have that information.

01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:39.120
[Amit Varma]: Now number one, given that the consequential benefits of freedom no longer apply because

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:41.120
[Amit Varma]: the knowledge problem is solved.

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:43.520
[Amit Varma]: Is there still a moral case for freedom?

01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:45.200
[Amit Varma]: That's question number one.

01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:51.300
[Amit Varma]: And question number two is that if the consequences of freedom like right now, you know, you and

01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:55.800
[Amit Varma]: I are in that lucky spot where we argue for freedom, we can do it from first principles

01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:57.640
[Amit Varma]: and the right to self ownership.

01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:00.280
[Amit Varma]: And we can say that look, freedom is good for everybody.

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:04.640
[Amit Varma]: But if freedom wasn't good for everybody, if the consequentialist case did not exist,

01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:09.960
[Amit Varma]: if freedom actually made people worse off, then would there still be a moral case for

01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:14.400
[Amit Varma]: it, which would, you know, go beyond that?

01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:19.120
[Guest]: Well, let's see, those are big questions.

01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:27.120
[Guest]: In your first question, you posited a huge assumption that AI can not only know, but

01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:30.200
[Guest]: anticipate what we don't even know yet.

01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:33.800
[Guest]: And therefore, the knowledge problem is solved.

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:41.720
[Guest]: I don't believe that's going to happen because I don't believe any algorithm can know what

01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:47.880
[Guest]: I'm going to think tomorrow, especially when different circumstances are offered to me.

01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:51.840
[Guest]: It's a thought experiment, it's a thought experiment, except by premise.

01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:52.840
[Guest]: Let's assume that it can happen.

01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:58.400
[Guest]: No, no, I think you're asking me, what if the world worked in a different way?

01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:01.760
[Guest]: Well, but it doesn't work in a different way.

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:10.880
[Guest]: James Buchanan objected once to the invisible hand metaphor, because he said there is no

01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:17.560
[Guest]: point toward which the invisible hand is moving you because the point, what people want, how

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:21.160
[Guest]: to satisfy their desires is constantly moving.

01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:26.360
[Guest]: And so I just think you really are saying, what if humanity was different, would you

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.600
[Guest]: still favor the same rules?

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:36.720
[Guest]: Well, I don't favor individual rights for honeybees, but I don't believe humans are

01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:38.560
[Guest]: honeybees and they're not going to be.

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:46.640
[Guest]: So therefore, I guess I would say in the first circumstance you described, a computer can

01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:52.960
[Guest]: know not only everything I want right now and how I would order my preferences, but

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:57.680
[Guest]: how I will order my preferences tomorrow and a year from now and 10 years from now.

01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:04.600
[Guest]: Well, then in that case, I'm still in favor of individual freedom because I am a rational

01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:09.280
[Guest]: thinking being who ought to be allowed to make decisions.

01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:14.640
[Guest]: Even if you said that, you know what decisions I'm going to make before I know it, I still

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:16.520
[Guest]: think I should be able to do it.

01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:23.680
[Guest]: Now the second question, which I do think is somewhat different, what if our consequentialist

01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:37.160
[Guest]: analysis and our lived experience persuaded us that free markets don't lead to the best

01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:43.480
[Guest]: outcomes in terms of social harmony and economic growth?

01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:45.360
[Guest]: Would I still favor freedom?

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:53.400
[Guest]: I think in that circumstance, you are talking about a different kind of being.

01:54:53.400 --> 01:55:02.880
[Guest]: And so it's not a coincidence that respecting freedom leads to the best outputs.

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:10.200
[Guest]: It's because respecting freedom is respecting the nature of human beings.

01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:16.000
[Guest]: So if the nature of human beings was different, if we were honeybees, then central direction

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.240
[Guest]: might make sense.

01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:19.400
[Guest]: But we're not.

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:28.840
[Guest]: And so if you posit a world where central planning produces clearly better results than

01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:34.880
[Guest]: relying on pluralism and decentralized markets, then I think you're talking about a different

01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:41.640
[Guest]: kind of being and philosophers and theologians and all of us would think of the world in

01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:43.400
[Guest]: a different way.

01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:49.360
[Guest]: So I guess I'm not prepared to say, yes, I would support individual rights, even if I

01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:54.560
[Guest]: knew it meant living like Venezuela instead of like Denmark, because it would be a different

01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:58.080
[Guest]: world and it would be different human beings.

01:55:58.080 --> 01:55:59.080
[Amit Varma]: That's a great answer.

01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:01.560
[Amit Varma]: And your point about the honeybees reminded me of something A.O.

01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:06.640
[Amit Varma]: Wilson once said, where he remarked that communism would have been perfect for ants.

01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:12.720
[Amit Varma]: And his overall verdict on communism was great idea, wrong species.

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:15.200
[Amit Varma]: And I think that's right.

01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:18.120
[Amit Varma]: So I'm totally going to borrow your answer the next time someone throws this question

01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:19.120
[Amit Varma]: back at me.

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:21.600
[Amit Varma]: A final question, David, you've been very kind with your time.

01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:23.680
[Amit Varma]: So a final question.

01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:31.800
[Amit Varma]: When you know, looking into the future, what makes you hope and what makes you despair

01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:35.360
[Amit Varma]: about the prospect for individual?

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:42.040
[Guest]: I'm very troubled right now by the rise of illiberal authoritarianism, sort of on both

01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:46.480
[Guest]: right and left, to the extent those categories make sense in a lot of countries around the

01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:48.960
[Guest]: world.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:56.480
[Guest]: It does feel kind of like is this the early 1930s with the rise of fascists and communists,

01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:04.480
[Guest]: all these bad ideas, even stupid ideas like protectionism and socialism and ethnic nationalism

01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:06.280
[Guest]: are back.

01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:08.120
[Guest]: That makes me despair.

01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:13.560
[Guest]: In the long run, I'm an optimist because freedom works and central planning and socialism and

01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:15.720
[Guest]: fascism don't.

01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:24.720
[Guest]: And once human beings discovered that progress was possible, that economic growth is possible,

01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:32.520
[Guest]: I don't think in the long run they will put up with people and classes and policies that

01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:34.640
[Guest]: severely impede that.

01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:39.440
[Guest]: So a hundred years from now, will people be freer and will we be richer?

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:41.600
[Guest]: Yes, I'm pretty confident of that.

01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:43.120
[Guest]: 500 years from now?

01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:44.120
[Guest]: Yes.

01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:50.120
[Guest]: I know there are people who talk about cycles of history and so on, but I think the industrial

01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:57.120
[Guest]: revolution, liberalism, what Deirdre McCloskey calls the great enrichment, as she says, is

01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:02.800
[Guest]: the most important thing that happened since we settled down and started farming.

01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:11.600
[Guest]: And so we will have all sorts of cycles and changes, but freedom works and people will

01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:18.440
[Guest]: want the fruits of freedom and over the long run, we're going to move more of the world,

01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:21.040
[Guest]: we'll move more in the direction of more freedom.

01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:24.880
[Amit Varma]: David, over the years, I've learned a lot reading your books and I've learned a lot

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:25.920
[Amit Varma]: chatting with you today.

01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:28.600
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much for coming on the scene in the Unseen.

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:33.360
[Guest]: Thank you very much for the opportunity.

01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:37.520
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoyed listening to the show, I suggest you hop over to your nearest bookstore online

01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:41.320
[Amit Varma]: or otherwise and buy The Libertarian Mind by David Bose.

01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:45.240
[Amit Varma]: These other books are also linked on the episode page and I'd in fact advise you to look at

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:49.680
[Amit Varma]: the show notes for this episode on the episode page and check out some of the readings that

01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:50.680
[Amit Varma]: I've recommended there.

01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:55.600
[Amit Varma]: I'd also done a past episode on libertarianism where I was a guest and I was interviewed

01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:59.040
[Amit Varma]: on another podcast, a Pragati podcast by my friend Pawan Srinath.

01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:06.560
[Amit Varma]: So that sort of has my own thoughts on libertarianism where I place consent at the center of everything.

01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:07.560
[Amit Varma]: Do check that out.

01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:15.680
[Amit Varma]: You can follow David on Twitter at David underscore Bose, which is D A V I D underscore B O A

01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:16.680

[Amit Varma]: Thank you for listening and do consider, I didn't force you to listen.

01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:45.840
[Unknown]: It was a voluntary action.

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:48.800
[Unknown]: How aware do you think you are of your laws and rights?

01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:51.440
[Unknown]: Do you look up to laws when you are caught up in situations?

01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:54.400
[Unknown]: Do you know what your rights are when you're stuck somewhere bad?

01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:59.040
[Unknown]: Well, here's a show that can help you move an inch closer to being aware of what your

01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:00.040
[Unknown]: rights are.
