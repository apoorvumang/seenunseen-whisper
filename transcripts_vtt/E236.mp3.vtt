00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160
[Amit Varma]: Arthur C. Clarke once said, quote, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.280
[Amit Varma]: magic, stop quote. If someone from say 1981 travelled all the way to 2021, this world

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.840
[Amit Varma]: would look magical. I suppose every generation feels that the world has changed so much in

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.760
[Amit Varma]: its time. But this is more true of our generation than any other. Technology has made the pace

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.200
[Amit Varma]: of change almost exponential over the last few decades. A friend of mine once remarked

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.240
[Amit Varma]: that kids today may never know what it is to be lost, physically lost. All hail GPS

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.960
[Amit Varma]: and the internet. When I was a kid, we would struggle to get hold of books and films and

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.800
[Amit Varma]: music that we wanted. Our life was a series of lost counterfactuals, things we did not

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.520
[Amit Varma]: discover because we were in a bubble, journeys we could not take or even conceive of. All

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.280
[Amit Varma]: that has changed so much. And here in the second half of my 40s, I sometimes find myself

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.160
[Amit Varma]: taking this change for granted. What I would have found magical yesterday is commonplace

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.640
[Amit Varma]: today. And I think it makes sense to sometimes sit back and take stock. This is especially

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.320
[Amit Varma]: so in India, where so much has changed. And so much has also not changed. Some of the

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.920
[Amit Varma]: change is superficial, some of it is deep and fundamental. Our lives have changed, our

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.960
[Amit Varma]: society has changed, our politics has changed. And what better way to consider all of this

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.560
[Amit Varma]: than through the life of someone whose main preoccupation for more than 40 years has been

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.160
[Amit Varma]: to document and make sense of the present moment. There's a lot to learn from that journey.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.360
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.640
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Varma.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.520
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is Veer Sanghvi, one of the giants of

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.200
[Amit Varma]: Indian journalism. He became an editor in his 20s around 40 years ago and shaped what

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.040
[Amit Varma]: I thought was the finest news magazine of my growing up years called Sunday. He would

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.280
[Amit Varma]: go on to be a pioneer in Indian television as well. And he also edited the Hindustan

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.080
[Amit Varma]: Times for a few years and brought it kicking and screaming into the 21st century. He can

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.800
[Amit Varma]: write about food, politics and society with equal ease. But in all these years, his gaze

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.440
[Amit Varma]: has mostly gone outwards. Until now. Veer has just come out with a memoir called A Rude

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.600
[Amit Varma]: Life and I love reading it. I've admired his clear lucid prose since the early 1990s. But

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.160
[Amit Varma]: the one thing that surprised me about this book is the humor. It's sharp, witty and self-reflective

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.440
[Amit Varma]: and I found myself laughing out loud throughout the book. But this book does much more than

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.500
[Amit Varma]: just make us laugh. It also gives us a sense of the times and is especially acute when

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.480
[Amit Varma]: it comes to understanding Indian politics. I loved having this conversation. But before

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.560
[Amit Varma]: we get to it, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.920
[Amit Varma]: How well do I know myself? Not as well as I used to think I do. We sometimes realize

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.320
[Amit Varma]: the extent to which other people are a mystery to us. But we underestimate how much we are

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.960
[Amit Varma]: a mystery to ourselves. We often imagine that we are blank slates. But that's not true.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.080
[Amit Varma]: We are shaped and constrained by our genes. And understanding the way we are wired can

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.520
[Amit Varma]: help us make the most of them. And one way towards this self-knowledge comes from the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.920
[Amit Varma]: sponsors of this episode, MapMyGenome. 20 years ago, sequencing your genome could cost

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.120
[Amit Varma]: around $20 million. Today, MapMyGenome can sequence your genes and give you a genome

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.240
[Amit Varma]: number 3, as it were, for just a few thousand rupees. You only need to get tested once,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.240
[Amit Varma]: and they give you an intimate understanding of the way you are wired. This helps you in

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.000
[Amit Varma]: a number of ways. It tells you which diseases you are predisposed to, so you can take steps

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.680
[Amit Varma]: to avoid them. It helps you understand what kind of nutrition is right for you. It helps

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.560
[Amit Varma]: you understand what kind of sporting activities are right for you. Are you built for power

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.400
[Amit Varma]: or for speed? I'm definitely going to use their services because the key to making the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.360
[Amit Varma]: most of yourself is to first know yourself. So do head on over to MapMyGenome.in and check

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.360
[Amit Varma]: out their products. You will get a 50% discount on Genome Patri if you use my discount code

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.640
[Amit Varma]: UNSEEN. That's right. For 50% off, use the discount code UNSEEN at MapMyGenome.in. Know

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.640
[Amit Varma]: yourself.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.880
[Amit Varma]: We are welcome to the scene and the unseen. Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.720
[Amit Varma]: So you know, before we start talking about your book and about your life, and your book

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.920
[Amit Varma]: is about your life. So in a sense, they're kind of the same thing. Tell me a little bit

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.080
[Amit Varma]: about how the last few months have been for you, because you're someone who travels a

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.800
[Amit Varma]: lot, who likes to, you know, go out, meet people. Sometimes your work requires that

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.240
[Amit Varma]: in terms of your shows or your journalism. You go to a lot of restaurants, as we know.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.920
[Amit Varma]: So how have the last few months in COVID been for you? And, you know, are there things that

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.080
[Amit Varma]: they've made you kind of rethink and look at and so on?

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.960
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, Amit, they've actually not been great for me. They've not been great,

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.760
[Guest]: I think, for anyone. But like the first few months of COVID, which was March last year,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.960
[Guest]: we didn't do anything, my wife and I, we just stayed at home. And then when that first wave

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.000
[Guest]: appeared to recede slightly, we said to ourselves that this is not good for your mental health

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.640
[Guest]: to just be restricted to one home. We were too scared to meet people. So when we spoke

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:16.000
[Guest]: to people, it was always Zoom or phone calls, FaceTime. And then we said, we've got to learn

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.920
[Guest]: to get out. By that stage, fortunately, hotels had opened again. So we picked hotels that

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.000
[Guest]: were within driving distance of Delhi, and where I was pretty sure of the COVID protocols.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.960
[Guest]: And it's probably an unfair advantage, but because of the work I do, I can call up general

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.400
[Guest]: managers and insist that I live in a bubble, that the people around me are people who've

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.680
[Guest]: been tested or whatever. So we started traveling, we started doing, at the moment, I'm in Jaipur,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.480
[Guest]: for instance, we started doing one weekend a month, just to give us a sense of what it

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.920
[Guest]: was like being out of home. And it did huge things for our mental health, like I'm sitting

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.760
[Guest]: here and I'm talking to you, I wrote, I've written an article today. So it's not as though

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.720
[Guest]: what I do, when I'm away is significantly different from what I would do when I was

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.320
[Guest]: at home. It's just the change of scene, I think, makes you feel less like a prisoner

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.640
[Guest]: of circumstances. But we're still careful. I still try and do room service. I avoid crowded

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.440
[Guest]: restaurants. If I'm in public, I wear masks. So travel, I think I've done an article next

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.440
[Guest]: Sunday about what you should do when you're traveling. I've also, when it comes to my

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.720
[Guest]: social life, it's zero, I think. I've been, in the last 20 months, to two people's homes

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.320
[Guest]: for dinner. Both are people who I knew had either had COVID recently, and therefore were

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:43.280
[Guest]: okay, or had been double vaccinated. And it was nice, it was, in a sense, reassuring,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.280
[Guest]: you felt human again. But it's also, I mean, scary. I know people say that, I mean, I was

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.560
[Guest]: double vaccinated many months ago, I was one of the first people to be double vaccinated,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.360
[Guest]: because I have the advantage of being over 60. But even so, I think, I continue to be

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.360
[Guest]: terrified.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:07.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, that's quite resonant. And this whole sort of theme of relooking at relationships

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.400
[Amit Varma]: and how we live our lives is something that's in your book. One thing that kind of struck

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.920
[Amit Varma]: me and resonated with me in your book was that it sort of bookended with your mother,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.000
[Amit Varma]: in a sense, obviously, it begins with your parents, and then it ends with her death three

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.800
[Amit Varma]: years ago. And that resonated with me, because one of the themes that you struck upon was

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.280
[Amit Varma]: how much she changed, where at the start of the book, she's an entirely different person.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.800
[Amit Varma]: And at the end, when you mention her, it changes. And I've seen a similar change with my own

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.880
[Amit Varma]: parents, you know, my mother died some 13-14 years ago. And, you know, she had changed

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.240
[Amit Varma]: a lot for reasons that, you know, one can only sort of speculate upon. My dad had kind

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.920
[Amit Varma]: of changed in a different direction before he passed earlier this year, kind of mellowed

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.760
[Amit Varma]: and become a very different person. And this is a difference that one can sort of see from

00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:00.760
[Amit Varma]: the outside. And so I have two questions here. One is that, does one's understanding of how

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.440
[Amit Varma]: people changed and all of that, does it become clearer when you're remembering because your

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.080
[Amit Varma]: book, in a sense, is an act of remembering your life? Does it become clearer with that?

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.200
[Amit Varma]: Can you take that step back and look? Because at some point, you've also done that about

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.320
[Amit Varma]: yourself, where you have reflected on how after you came back from abroad, somebody

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.880
[Amit Varma]: told your mother that, oh, he used to be so arrogant, but now he's kind of chilled out.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.480
[Amit Varma]: And then there are some lovely passages where you sort of reflect on your own possible transformation.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:36.640
[Amit Varma]: So how does this act of memory sort of help you look at others in this way? And when you

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.440
[Amit Varma]: see the change that has happened to others, possibly because of biological reasons as

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.800
[Amit Varma]: well, it's not that someone overnight changes, you know, the chemical imbalance in your brain

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.440
[Amit Varma]: changes or whatever. People just change differently. I mean, I remember I wrote a column after

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.560
[Amit Varma]: Chris Cornell, the musician committed suicide a couple of years back. And there was a sort

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.840
[Amit Varma]: of speculation that he had been on some medication, which causes suicidal thoughts. So it's not

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.720
[Amit Varma]: as if he fundamentally changed as a person. It was sort of something beyond his control.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.080
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, we hear stories of how some of these mass shooters in the US, I think the

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.760
[Amit Varma]: last big incident like that, they did an autopsy on the guy. And they realized that around

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.680
[Amit Varma]: the time he started getting violent, there was sort of a tumor in his brain, you know,

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.600
[Amit Varma]: which caused that sort of behavior. And that kind of made me think about how character

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:30.020
[Amit Varma]: is so contingent, that identity is contingent, that we think that I am this, this is my essence.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:35.680
[Amit Varma]: But it's all contingent upon all these accidents of circumstance, not just outside, but inside.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.240
[Amit Varma]: So you know, does that change the way you kind of look at yourself? Does this act of

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.160
[Amit Varma]: remembering enhance your self-awareness in a sense?

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.840
[Guest]: I think it's a very good question. It's also, I think, very accurate. Because I'm not the

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:54.480
[Guest]: kind of guy who looks back a lot. I tend to just move on. But when I sat down to write

00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.080
[Guest]: this book, I had by definition to look back. And I saw, I mean, most clearly, I think about

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:06.280
[Guest]: myself, but also about my mother. She is at the start of the book, this very confident,

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:11.320
[Guest]: Western educated woman in an era when hardly anyone was Western educated, who earns their

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.640
[Guest]: own money, who's qualified, who arranges for my father, who didn't have that kind of money

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.780
[Guest]: or any of her advantages to go off and marry her abroad, who then works in London, puts

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:29.280
[Guest]: him through the bar. To contrast that woman with the woman I saw after my father died,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:35.040
[Guest]: it's like they were two completely different people. I think to some extent, it was tragedy

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:42.640
[Guest]: that I think she couldn't cope with my father's death. I think in many ways, Indian women,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.760
[Guest]: particularly of that generation, were taught to treat their husbands as Lord and Master.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.360
[Guest]: And that even if you had a career or you had anything, once you were married, everything

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.040
[Guest]: was second to what your husband wanted to what your husband did. And then when your

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.640
[Guest]: husband was not there any longer, you sort of lost your way. I think that was one of

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.320
[Guest]: the big problems that she faced. She'd also had in the 60s, a very serious bout of ill

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.840
[Guest]: health during which she nearly died. And though people say she recovered, etc. I think when

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.520
[Guest]: you're conscious of how fragile things are, you lose your confidence. I think that made

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:25.600
[Guest]: a lot of difference to her. And of course, age by the end, most of her friends that died,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.400
[Guest]: she was hanging on, she didn't really know what to do. She was dependent on me, she was

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:36.360
[Guest]: at the mercy of anybody who wanted to pick on her. I mean, I say all this now with certainty,

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.280
[Guest]: but until I sat down to write the book, you're absolutely right. It had never occurred to

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:48.120
[Guest]: me that these were the changes in her life. Because to be widowed at 50, to never as far

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:54.800
[Guest]: as I know, have a boyfriend, a relationship, again, is not normal. It's strange. And yet

00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.480
[Guest]: women of her generation would not consider marrying again, or all the obvious things

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.320
[Guest]: that people now would do. Certainly, I would never have objected. But I think she herself

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.960
[Guest]: was built in the way in which she thought this was it. I was in love with this man,

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:15.840
[Guest]: I married him. And now that part of my life is over. I remember when we came back to India

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.880
[Guest]: from New York after my father had died. She considered whether she should wear a bindi,

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:26.600
[Guest]: whether she should wear jewelry, that the widows in her family before had worn white

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:32.400
[Guest]: after that. And I was only 15. But it just struck me as such an offensive idea that she

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.160
[Guest]: should have to do any of these things. So I said, no, you wear jewelry, you wear your

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:43.240
[Guest]: colors. And despite that, I think for several years, five at least, after my father's death,

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:48.720
[Guest]: she refused to put a bindi on her head until I made an issue out of it. And I said, his

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:55.120
[Guest]: life has ended, your life has not ended. You shouldn't be like that. Now all of that makes

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.400
[Guest]: a certain amount of sense when I sat down and had a lot of time during the lockdown

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.800
[Guest]: to think about it. At the time, no, I don't think I think when you live with people or

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:10.280
[Guest]: they're close to you, you just see them change day by day, without ever figuring out what

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.800
[Guest]: it is that changed them. It's the same with me, you quote the example from that, what

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:21.440
[Guest]: my principal said. Until my father died when I was 15, I had, in many ways, the last few

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.800
[Guest]: years, certainly a fairly charmed life. In the last couple of years in school, I was

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:31.800
[Guest]: doing very well. I had good academic results. I had all the usual stuff that people like

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:38.720
[Guest]: me have, head of the debating team, editor of the school magazine, et cetera, et cetera.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.520
[Guest]: And I had this, what was then, I suppose, seen by outsiders as a fairly glamorous life

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:49.720
[Guest]: in that we had a house in London. I went abroad for my summer holidays, and it seemed almost

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.920
[Guest]: too good to be true. And then my father died, we came back, and there was this sickening

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.440
[Guest]: realization that there wasn't going to be that much money. There was not going to be

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:04.000
[Guest]: a house in London. I had no future mapped out for me. Whatever I had to do, I had to

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.840
[Guest]: do on my own, that my mother was not going to be any help, that even if I was going to

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:14.440
[Guest]: go and study abroad, which eventually I did, I had to find the school, the university myself,

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.880
[Guest]: and that I was really left to my own devices. So I think the contrast when you're at that

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:25.400
[Guest]: age between leading this charmed life and thinking everything is set out in gold and

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.160
[Guest]: you know what you will do and things will be all right, which sad to say is true of

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.020
[Guest]: many people now from young business families and political families, but it was certainly

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:39.880
[Guest]: less true of most people then. I think that probably scared me inside. I mean, of course

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:45.000
[Guest]: it changed me, but I think it changed me because it scared me. It made me conscious of how

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:53.320
[Guest]: fragile everything is, how life can change. My father in April 1971 was this glamorous

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:59.880
[Guest]: globe-trotting figure who thought he'd had a bit of jaundice. By July 1971, he was dead.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:06.560
[Guest]: So I've always realized that nothing in life is permanent, that things change, that

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:12.080
[Guest]: you never take anything for granted, that often it's circumstances beyond anybody's

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.880
[Guest]: control. And I've also, I think, realized watching my mother, that people change. Never

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.760
[Guest]: make assumptions based on what somebody is like today. There is no guarantee that the

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:28.160
[Guest]: person will be the same even a month later or two months later. And often, and all of

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.440
[Guest]: us must do this, you work with people and they change. You work for people. And I think

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.920
[Guest]: it happens to nearly everybody. Initially, there's a honeymoon period. They're wildly

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.400
[Guest]: enthusiastic about you when you say, I've never had a better job. And then of course,

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.320
[Guest]: they move on and they find somebody else that's less enthusiastic about you. Many people are

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:52.560
[Guest]: shocked by this and try and regain the attention or affections, for want of a better term,

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:58.240
[Guest]: of their employers or their bosses. And I think I always realized that things would

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:05.240
[Guest]: always change, that nothing was permanent. So in that sense that my mother and my father's

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:11.360
[Guest]: death changed what I was in how I looked at people. Now, I say this again, so confidently

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.000
[Guest]: in answer to your question, but it's something I only really understood when I sat down to

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.240
[Guest]: write the book.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.560
[Amit Varma]: So how did it precisely change the way you look at other people? Like, did it make you

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.720
[Guest]: more compassionate towards them?

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:30.840
[Guest]: Yes, it made me much more compassionate, much more understanding of other people's problems.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:37.080
[Guest]: It made me less judgmental of people. Because people do one set of things when circumstances

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.960
[Guest]: are good. And they do a completely different set of things when circumstances are bad.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:47.360
[Guest]: And you've got to understand that when circumstances are bad, choices are taken out of people's

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.440
[Guest]: hands. They have to do what they have to do. I mean, there's that first line in The Great

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:58.200
[Guest]: Gatsby, which is, in my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice, which

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:03.640
[Guest]: I've been turning over in my head ever since, when judging other people. Remember, not everyone

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:08.720
[Guest]: has been born with the advantages you have. And I was born with advantages, there's no

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:14.640
[Guest]: getting around it. And I lost many of those advantages. So I was very conscious that other

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.760
[Guest]: people either weren't born with those advantages, or had lost those advantages. And to certain

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:25.680
[Guest]: judgment about them, or to say things about them was wrong. So it changed me in that way.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:31.160
[Guest]: It also changed me, I think, in how I respond to people. Many people on social media will

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:36.760
[Guest]: say that anybody says anything nice to me on Twitter says I enjoyed your column or whatever.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:42.600
[Guest]: I nearly always, as much as it's humanly possible, reply. If I have an email or a message sent

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:49.040
[Guest]: to me, I try and reply within the hour. It's taught me that you can't take people for granted,

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.560
[Guest]: that you should be grateful for every little bit of praise, every little bit of human contact.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.160
[Guest]: Even if you can't necessarily do what people want you to do, be polite, be decent, because

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.520
[Guest]: ultimately, you could well be in that situation, you could well be the supplicant asking somebody

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:10.480
[Guest]: for something. Nothing in life is written, nothing in life is guaranteed. You can't change

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.400
[Guest]: that. The only way you can change it is by, A, not having expectations of people, B, by

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.640
[Guest]: recognizing that there will be change, and C, in all your dealings with people, be as

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.880
[Guest]: compassionate and as polite as possible.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.480
[Amit Varma]: That's a profound insight. And what sort of strikes me is that you got it so young, like,

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.640
[Amit Varma]: I think I got it much, much later than you. I think many people don't get it at all. Like

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.120
[Amit Varma]: there is, of course, this philosophical debate about whether there is any free will or not.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.560
[Amit Varma]: And I think there's a very good case to be made that there isn't. But even if it were

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.720
[Amit Varma]: not the case that there is free will, we should still behave as if there is free will, of

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.600
[Amit Varma]: course, because you want to hold people accountable for their actions and so on. But by an extension

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.520
[Amit Varma]: of that, it often happens that we judge people for things that are essentially beyond their

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.000
[Amit Varma]: control. We, like even in our own case, when we succeed, we ascribe too much credit to

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
[Amit Varma]: ourselves. When we fail, we are too hard on ourselves. And we do a similar thing with

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.560
[Amit Varma]: others, whereas luck and fortune plays such an incredibly big role. And especially on

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.680
[Amit Varma]: social media. Social media, of course, is the fountainhead of being judgmental, you

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.160
[Amit Varma]: know, and we can kind of discuss that later. Another thing that intrigued me about your

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.840
[Amit Varma]: book is at one point, you say that the year 67 to 71 were your happiest years when you

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:26.360
[Amit Varma]: were 11 to 15. And 15, of course, is when your father died. So I'm thinking about how

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:32.600
[Amit Varma]: you concluded, like, how does one define particular years as happiest years? Like, do you remember

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.520
[Amit Varma]: being happy in the moment then? Or is the happiness in the remembering that those were

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.880
[Amit Varma]: good times, even though then you may not have been particularly aware of it. And the thing

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.360
[Amit Varma]: is that if you are to conclude that the happiness is in the remembering, then one could argue

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:51.520
[Amit Varma]: that you can remember the happiness of any particular period in time and sort of take

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.880
[Amit Varma]: pleasure in that, including the present moment like elsewhere in the book. And this I think

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.480
[Amit Varma]: is towards the end where you write about how you have learned to take happiness from small

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:04.160
[Amit Varma]: things, which is again, a sort of a realization that I came to much later. Obviously, those

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:10.040
[Amit Varma]: years are something that you kind of look upon wistfully. So tell me a little bit about

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:15.080
[Amit Varma]: this about what were your notions of happiness earlier? Have they kind of changed? And how

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:20.000
[Amit Varma]: big a role do you think that our own act of remembering plays in them? Because if I remember

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.920
[Amit Varma]: a memory as happy, it becomes happy. If I remember the non-happy aspects of it, it doesn't

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.240
[Amit Varma]: seem so happy. Maybe the happiness I get is from remembering it and at the time I was

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:35.480
[Guest]: just going through the motions. I think it's a very valid question. I think, I mean, now

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:40.440
[Guest]: that you put it to me and I think about it, one reason I see them as being such happy

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:45.720
[Guest]: years was those were really the last years I spent with my father. And therefore the

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:52.140
[Guest]: memories of my father, memories of that closeness make it happy for me. These were also the

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:58.240
[Guest]: years when my father would not always been successful, was very successful, had lots

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.720
[Guest]: and lots of disposable income. And when you're what, 11 years old, 12 years old, what do

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:09.000
[Guest]: you want? You want to holiday to London, you want to go to Hamleys, buy toys. When you're

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.880
[Guest]: slightly older to go to Carnaby Street, buy nice clothes. All of that happened. There

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:20.360
[Guest]: were very few demands on me. I was a lonely child. I had the love of two doting parents.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:25.440
[Guest]: And then of course it collapses in 71. So it's entirely possible that while I was not

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:31.840
[Guest]: probably the happiest during that period, because of what followed from 1971 and the

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:37.160
[Guest]: unhappiness that followed, I have romanticized that period in my memory. And it seems like

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:43.720
[Guest]: one gorgeous, glorious sunlit period. And it wasn't really, I mean, the way you've asked

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.960
[Guest]: me that question has made me think about that. I certainly think of it always as being this

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:54.320
[Guest]: happy period, but that's not tied up with any notion of happiness. It's tied up because

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.000
[Guest]: I had all the things that I was to lose in 1971.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, one of the themes that I keep coming back to in which I kind of read about

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.920
[Amit Varma]: it a few months back and it sort of blew me away is the nature of memory, how our brain

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.200
[Amit Varma]: processes memory in the sense that when we remember an event for the first time, we are

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.480
[Amit Varma]: remembering the event, but every subsequent time we remember the remembering. And that,

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, so it's like Chinese whispers in our brain and things can kind of gradually

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.440
[Amit Varma]: shift. Now, as you mentioned that you were born to great privilege and some of that was

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.540
[Amit Varma]: stripped away. But regardless of that, a lot of that remained. And when I kind of look

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:34.360
[Amit Varma]: back on my own childhood, I mean, I was the son of a civil servant. We were relative to

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:39.080
[Amit Varma]: the rest of India, extremely well off, absolutely in the elite. And it took me many years into

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:45.040
[Amit Varma]: adulthood to realize how some really negative character traits of mine were kind of formed

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.160
[Amit Varma]: by this. Like I realized it from my father, who was very proud of reading, who had thousands

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.480
[Amit Varma]: of books. From him, I think I got a certain intellectual arrogance. From my mother, I

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.640
[Amit Varma]: got a certain social arrogance because of where we were. And it took me many years to

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.960
[Amit Varma]: kind of strip those away and sort of become my own person as it were. And obviously, we

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:08.220
[Amit Varma]: are being formed throughout our lives. But we can only sort of look back on the forming

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:13.520
[Amit Varma]: of the past and not whatever might be happening in the present. Now, you just mentioned and

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.680
[Amit Varma]: you've written about in your book about how perhaps at 15 after your father died, it was

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.320
[Amit Varma]: a shock for you at various levels, you became more independent, you became more compassionate,

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:29.040
[Amit Varma]: you started taking things less for granted. But beyond that, can you kind of elaborate

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:34.240
[Amit Varma]: on like how self aware were you in your journey? In your book, of course, it is the act of

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.400
[Amit Varma]: writing down, it forces you to be self aware. But how much of that self awareness is there?

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.360
[Amit Varma]: Like when you look back on the younger Veer Sanghvi of say 20 years old, 25 years old,

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:49.320
[Amit Varma]: 30 years old, do you see things that just make you go like, shit, I was like that, or

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.400
[Amit Varma]: I did that, or I thought like that? Tell me a little bit about that.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.800
[Guest]: I'm trying to think. I think it's fair to say that people who grew up as you and I did,

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:04.240
[Guest]: in upper middle class households in India, who went to what we would now concede were

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:10.120
[Guest]: elite institutions of learning, who were able to speak in our own language with and speak

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:16.560
[Guest]: in English with the same dexterity, were as much at home with Western reference points,

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:21.720
[Guest]: as we were with the way we were brought up, were hugely, hugely privileged during that

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:28.160
[Guest]: period. And I don't think I saw it because the people I was around, I went to school

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.880
[Guest]: at the boarding school, it wasn't like a fancy boarding school, like Dune School, where everybody

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.800
[Guest]: was super privileged or whatever. Most of the people who were my friends, were children

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:43.400
[Guest]: of lieutenant colonels in the army. Now, lieutenant colonel is a senior position, but it's not

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.280
[Guest]: like you're a general or whatever. So there was that sense, or joint secretaries, there

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:53.160
[Guest]: was not that sense that you were this huge, privileged person. So we thought of ourselves

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:59.080
[Guest]: as just being middle class. When I went abroad, and I went to England, I had the option, I

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.400
[Guest]: guess, of choosing a school that was full of privilege. And there were options to go

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:09.240
[Guest]: to Harrow or places like that. And I deliberately chose a school that gave me freedom, rather

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:14.160
[Guest]: than one that had a great reputation, or one that was a privilege. So now, whether this

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.640
[Guest]: was me consciously rejecting privilege, or whether this was me saying I'm privileged

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:23.520
[Guest]: anyhow, let me just go and have a good time, I'm not 100% sure about. When I came back

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:31.040
[Guest]: to Bombay, and I worked first for Bombay magazine in India today, and later for imprint, I became

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:36.920
[Guest]: more conscious of the fact that even within South Bombay, we were in a bubble relative

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:42.400
[Guest]: to the rest of Bombay. It didn't make that much sense to us to go to say Malad or some

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:48.320
[Guest]: place like that. Because we lived in an environment where people knew each other. And it was India

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.880
[Guest]: was in the 1970s, essentially, a relatively small country when it came to the upper middle

00:25:53.880 --> 00:26:00.560
[Guest]: classes. I knew then that there was something wrong with this. I knew also that Bombay wasn't

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.320
[Guest]: India, that I needed to get out, which is I've written in the book, is possibly one

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.680
[Guest]: reason why, though I've put it slightly damningly and said, I didn't want to be a Bombay journalist

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:14.520
[Guest]: all my life. But it's one reason why I went out and tried to do things. But the honest

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:20.080
[Guest]: answer is, I think that I started working for Sunday. And by then I was what, 30 years

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:26.600
[Guest]: old. I don't think I was so conscious, conscious enough of the advantages I've had of the privilege

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:32.840
[Guest]: I've had. As you say, I've had heartbreak, I've had loss. But even after that loss, I

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.880
[Guest]: was still enormously privileged. And I don't think that had occurred to me till I was about

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.160
[Guest]: 30, which is when I began to come to terms with it.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.160
[Amit Varma]: Right. It's interesting that you should mention Doon School as a posh school, because I had

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.080
[Amit Varma]: Kanti Bajpai on a couple of weeks back, and he had gone to Doon School and he was saying,

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, people have the impression...

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.880
[Amit Varma]: Isn't he principal of Doon School or something?

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.600
[Amit Varma]: He was headmaster of Doon School at one point.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:00.080
[Guest]: Sorry, they're called headmasters in those schools. Our school is called principal, yeah.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.400
[Amit Varma]: There you go. That alone shows you how posh Doon is. But his point was that Doon isn't

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.720
[Amit Varma]: posh. His point was that people have the impression all the Babalok go there, but the Babalok

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.720
[Amit Varma]: went to Delhi schools. Doon had all the people in smaller towns who did not have access to

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.080
[Amit Varma]: good schools there. But regardless, that's something we can't get into.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:21.040
[Guest]: That's the sort of unusual view of Doon that was for the middle classes of Bareilly and

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.720
[Guest]: Raipur is the right school for them. It's not a view I've heard before, but if the headmaster

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.720
[Amit Varma]: says that, he says that.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.720
[Amit Varma]: If the headmaster says that, indeed. No, and another interesting theme that kind of keeps

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.080
[Amit Varma]: cropping up is something you just referred to, that in upper class India, everybody knew

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.240
[Amit Varma]: everybody else. Like I had Ram Guha on the show and, you know, when he was in college

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.920
[Amit Varma]: in the Delhi's and 70s, he was telling me about his classmates and they're basically

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.880
[Amit Varma]: the upper crust of India today. And similarly, Kanti mentioned, oh, Ram was junior to me

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:52.880
[Amit Varma]: in school. So it was that kind of a scene, which has kind of, you know, changed drastically.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.560
[Amit Varma]: How does that make you feel? I mean, the fact is that for about maybe 30, 40 years, for

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.940
[Amit Varma]: a long time, the elites were the same people, right? The people who had access to everything

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.840
[Amit Varma]: who ran the country, they were the same people. Now the rules of the game have changed in

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.280
[Amit Varma]: the sense that you can't even be sure that there are any elites because apart from the

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.760
[Amit Varma]: power of the Indian state, other power is spread out in different ways.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.720
[Amit Varma]: It's much more diffused. Wealth is spread out in a different way. Influence is spread

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.080
[Amit Varma]: out in a different way. Is this sort of something you've thought about? Is this something you've

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.520
[Amit Varma]: ever felt kind of threatened by? Because you were a prominent person in the old elite.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:31.200
[Amit Varma]: You've been an editor in journalism since your 20s. And the world has suddenly changed,

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:36.940
[Amit Varma]: I think, most drastically in the last 10 years. And a lot of it on social media where you

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:42.140
[Amit Varma]: have possibly been exposed to a sort of rudeness and disrespectfulness that you wouldn't have

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:47.520
[Amit Varma]: been otherwise. So just looking at these changing times, you know, how does one feel about it?

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.680
[Guest]: Well, I think there are many levels at which I can answer your question. The first is business

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:58.800
[Guest]: of elites and people who've been educated together and know each other is, I think,

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:04.720
[Guest]: to an extent true of most countries. I think England today, even now, is still more Oxbridge

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:12.200
[Guest]: dominated, more elite dominated, even when you're talking only of England, I think. Scotland,

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:17.000
[Guest]: Ireland, perhaps a different way. But England certainly is, despite all the egalitarian

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.680
[Guest]: moves of the last few years, the current prime minister is an Etonian. The man before him

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:29.440
[Guest]: was also an Etonian. So there is that element in societies like England, which in many ways

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:35.280
[Guest]: influences. But even if you go to America, and you talk to people at higher levels of

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:41.420
[Guest]: government, higher levels of finance or banking, almost all of them are Ivy League. So yes,

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:45.280
[Guest]: there is that element of he was two years junior to me at Harvard, or I knew him at

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:50.120
[Guest]: Yale, or he was in my college at Cambridge or whatever. So yes, there is that element

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.560
[Guest]: to of all elites, I accept that. The second element, though, this is hard to believe,

00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:00.480
[Guest]: is I don't think at Mayo we ever saw ourselves as the elite, we saw Doon as the elite. And

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:06.720
[Guest]: the logical progression from Doon was to go to St. Stephen's College. And nearly all these

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.400
[Guest]: chaps who will say he was at college with me, they won't call it St. Stephen's, they'll

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:16.680
[Guest]: say at college with me with a capital C, are basically people from St. Stephen's. I actually

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:22.480
[Guest]: miss that part of it. Because after I finished at Mayo, I went off to do school in England

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.120
[Guest]: for two and a half years, which you had to in those days. And at school in England, I

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:33.100
[Guest]: was just another boy from India, who was different and not anything like other people over there.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:38.840
[Guest]: So it knocked out any sense I'd had of being an elite. And there was also another aspect

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:43.480
[Guest]: of it, which is that by the time you finish in school in India, if you're a monitor, house

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:48.320
[Guest]: captain or whatever, you feel you're a dada, you're a top of the system. But you go back

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:53.360
[Guest]: and I went back, I went to back to school, because I had to do A-levels. And my first

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.940
[Guest]: term in Mill Hill, which is the school I went to in London, I was put in a dormitory along

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:04.560
[Guest]: with 12 other boys. And all my friends then were in colleges, places that allowed them

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:08.880
[Guest]: great deal of freedom. They were horrified by the idea that I was still wearing school

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.000
[Guest]: uniform, still sleeping in dormitories. So I think that knocked out some of the elite

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.120
[Guest]: pretensions that school in India may have had for me. And the thing about Oxford, at

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:23.920
[Guest]: least the kind of Oxford I knew, was, and I was not a member of the Bullingdon Club or

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:29.880
[Guest]: any fancy dining society, is that if it was an elite, it was an academic elite. You were

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:35.280
[Guest]: very conscious that it was very, very difficult to get into Oxford in those days. You could

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:40.080
[Guest]: get into an American university if you could pay for it. But in England, they paid for

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.680
[Guest]: everybody who went to university, whether it was Oxford or Cambridge, and as I discovered

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:50.120
[Guest]: to my delight, they also gave you a maintenance grant. So therefore, it was really much more

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:55.800
[Guest]: competitive perhaps, than it is today. So I did have that sense, and I will be honest

00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:01.680
[Guest]: about it, of a degree of intellectual superiority. But I did not have that sense of being the

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.640
[Guest]: Doon, St. Stephen's Network, which then went off and joined the IAS, went off and joined

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:13.480
[Guest]: some box wallet company. So in that sense, I was, I suppose, a bit of an outsider. Also,

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.360
[Guest]: when I came back, the jobs I was offered, I was offered by Prem Shekhar Jha, who was

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:21.800
[Guest]: then with the Economic Times, to become an assistant editor there. He shifted to the

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:27.000
[Guest]: Financial Express, he offered that to me. I was offered by Giriraj Jain to become an

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.360
[Guest]: assistant editor at the Times of India. These were establishment jobs. The job I took editing

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.800
[Guest]: a glossy magazine, which many of my Oxford contemporaries thought was a strange thing

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:43.960
[Guest]: to do, after having studied PPE for three years, also put me out of that normal elite

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.600
[Guest]: stream, because I was doing something I think that most people in the elite frankly had

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:54.440
[Guest]: contempt for, or looked down at me. So yes, I'm never denying that I was part of the sense

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:59.440
[Guest]: of privilege that I got where I had, at least in the early years, almost entirely because

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:07.280
[Guest]: of advantages of birth and of class, not necessarily because of intelligence or IQ. But all I'm

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:13.440
[Guest]: saying is that there is a classic Indian network. I was not part of it. And even within Bombay,

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.340
[Guest]: the people who were the elite in Bombay, it's very different from Delhi, were the rich.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:22.400
[Guest]: And I was very clearly not part of the rich. I was not part of the set that had lots of

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.480
[Guest]: money and lots of disposable income. So I was a bit of an outsider there. And journalism

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:32.840
[Guest]: is good because it gives you access to every set without having to be part of it, which

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:38.200
[Guest]: was one of the reasons I liked journalism. But in answer to your bigger question, which

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:44.960
[Guest]: is that India has expanded, and the old middle class counts for less and less, how do I cope

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:53.080
[Guest]: with that? Well, I think I knew this was inevitable when the economic reforms of 1991 came about.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:58.120
[Guest]: It was clear to me that there was going to be a new middle class. It was also as clear

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:03.960
[Guest]: to me that many of these people would be first-generation English speakers. And I think Manmohan Singh,

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:09.600
[Guest]: who's the man responsible for liberalization, also recognized that. And all of us, I think,

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:15.280
[Guest]: at some level, welcomed it because we thought this was a great thing, that India would be

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:20.920
[Guest]: a much more egalitarian society. But I don't think anybody expected the direction it would

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:26.720
[Guest]: take. I remember Prem Shankar Jha wrote in those days a piece saying that with this growth,

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.800
[Guest]: many, many people who have not been part of the middle class will now be raised to wealth

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.360
[Guest]: and will become part of the middle class. They will not have been brought up on secular

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:41.320
[Guest]: values or on the values that we consider the right values for India. They will all vote

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:47.920
[Guest]: for the BJP. And basically, in the century ahead, the BJP is the natural party of government.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.720
[Guest]: And I actually didn't agree with him. So maybe he's right. Now, when you look around, because

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:57.640
[Guest]: the new class that was raised to wealth, the new middle class, does not subscribe to any

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:04.320
[Guest]: of those ideas that my generation were brought upon. It believes, for instance, that if Pakistan

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:10.000
[Guest]: was a Muslim country, why shouldn't Hindus have run India? Why shouldn't it be a Hindu

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
[Guest]: country? What is all this secular nonsense except a way for a political class to get

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.280
[Guest]: the Muslim vote and to cultivate vote? I mean, you can argue and disagree with those views.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:26.640
[Guest]: But I think those are pretty much the views of many new members of the middle class. What

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:34.080
[Guest]: I didn't expect also is how much hatred there would be of the old middle class among the

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:39.480
[Guest]: new middle class. If you look at the abuse that is directed at the so-called Lachchans

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:46.000
[Guest]: elite, pronounced in this case as Lutyens, the term Lutyens has become not really a reference

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.600
[Guest]: to people who live in Lachchans's Delhi, because the people who live in Lachchans's Delhi for

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:55.380
[Guest]: the last seven years are Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, and their parents, right? So it's no

00:35:55.380 --> 00:36:00.680
[Guest]: longer a reference to the powerful people in India. It's essentially a reference to

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:07.200
[Guest]: English speakers, to people who speak in English, who went to, say, good colleges, good universities,

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:13.120
[Guest]: in a sense that you no longer matter where in charge, which is fine. I think every middle

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:19.320
[Guest]: class is entitled to some element of triumphalism. And fortunately for the new middle class,

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:23.880
[Guest]: social media has arrived to give them a much greater voice than they would otherwise have

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:30.240
[Guest]: had. So I am quite reconciled to them abusing me because I speak English, or I'm part of

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:35.760
[Guest]: some Lachchans class without ever having stayed in Lachchans's Delhi. I'm quite happy to do

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.760
[Guest]: that. But I also feel for better or for worse, that this is a phase that their children will

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:46.760
[Guest]: not feel the same way. This is a moment of transition. And this is a transitional generation,

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.840
[Guest]: which has a lot of bitterness and a lot of triumphalism. How their children will feel

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:55.240
[Guest]: about Hindu-Muslim issues, about secularism, I think we'll have to wait and see.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:00.560
[Amit Varma]: Wow, that's like a fascinating note of optimism there, because everything you said before

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:04.560
[Amit Varma]: that is almost sort of a trope on my show. I've discussed it with various guests, you

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:09.280
[Amit Varma]: know, Mr. Chah's words, he wrote it at the time, are just remarkably prescient, because

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:13.720
[Amit Varma]: one of the themes that I've explored in many episodes with many different guests is about

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:18.120
[Amit Varma]: how the constitution was sort of a liberal document. I mean, it's not as liberal as I

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:23.360
[Amit Varma]: would like, but nevertheless more liberal than our society, that it was a liberal document

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.880
[Amit Varma]: imposed by liberal elites upon an illiberal society. As Ambedkar himself said, this is

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:35.400
[Amit Varma]: basically a topsoil on our society. And there was some sense there that we'll put this topsoil

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:40.560
[Amit Varma]: and we'll kind of change India from the top down and obviously that failed. And my sense

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:45.440
[Amit Varma]: has been for the last few years that Indian politics has caught up with the Indian society.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:50.200
[Amit Varma]: What is the sort of polarizing politics that we see in place today is not something that

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:55.560
[Amit Varma]: should really surprise us. And this blindsided me, because I think all through my childhood

00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:02.120
[Amit Varma]: and my young adulthood and all of that, my assumption was that most of us sort of are,

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:06.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, like liberal, secular, all of those things. And I now realized that I was in a

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:11.360
[Amit Varma]: bit of a bubble, that I didn't realize to what extent I was in a bubble and to what

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:16.080
[Amit Varma]: extent my thinking was shaped by, you know, Western notions of the enlightenment and all

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:21.520
[Amit Varma]: of that, which, you know, most of the country simply doesn't share. Now, you would not have

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.000
[Amit Varma]: been in that bubble per se, even if physically, geographically, you're in a bubble, you're

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.600
[Amit Varma]: a journalist, you're writing about everything, you would have sort of figured this out much

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:35.640
[Amit Varma]: earlier, like, you know, in your wonderful chapters about politics of the 1980s and all,

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:39.280
[Amit Varma]: which I'll, you know, ask you more questions on as we go along in this episode. You've

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.800
[Amit Varma]: also spoken about the Hindu vote and how Hindu resentment was growing and the different shapes

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.800
[Amit Varma]: that took during the 80s. So in a sense, you did see it coming, you did realize that it

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.600
[Amit Varma]: was all there. So was there anything about the whole process that blindsided you? And

00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:00.800
[Amit Varma]: was there a period of time where you kind of began to realize that the country was different

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.560
[Amit Varma]: from what one's original notions of it might have been?

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:11.040
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, to take your point about Dr. Ambedkar and the topsoil, and that it would

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:17.400
[Guest]: go down and there would be a change. I actually think that worked. It worked from 47 to about

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:25.520
[Guest]: 1994, 1995, largely, that the old liberal class that had framed the constitution, even

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.160
[Guest]: if it didn't continue to rule India, because all kinds of people ruled India. But those

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:35.040
[Guest]: values, those constitutional values that set in place, were transmitted down the line,

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.360
[Guest]: because we were growing at a very slow rate. And the rate at which we were transmitting

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:46.320
[Guest]: them was also slow. I believe that the break with the past comes with 1991, because suddenly

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:52.640
[Guest]: there's a huge spurt of growth. Suddenly there's much more affluence than India has ever seen.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:58.040
[Guest]: Many families that didn't say have telephones, didn't have cars, didn't necessarily take

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:02.600
[Guest]: newspapers, let alone English newspapers. Suddenly the children come into the kind of

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:07.880
[Guest]: affluence they've not seen. The whole notion of a phone being a classifier or a dignifying

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:12.640
[Guest]: factor is over, because everybody now has more than one mobile phone, and then they

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.200
[Guest]: can do everything on it. The whole sense of a car, which meant something, because many

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:22.600
[Guest]: middle class families consider themselves to be upper middle class when they got a car,

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:27.600
[Guest]: that changed, because there was this big revolution. And instead of just fiats and ambassadors,

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:32.400
[Guest]: every kind of car was available in India, often at prices that were affordable to the

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:38.940
[Guest]: newly affluent. So when that happened, when this new middle class was created, partly

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:44.360
[Guest]: because of the collapse of the old signifiers, and partly because of the huge rate of growth,

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:50.480
[Guest]: I think the attempt of people at the top to try and convey this to people died down. And

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:55.840
[Guest]: I think many people, the RSS for instance, if you look at the appointments that were

00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:03.220
[Guest]: made in what there was no HRD ministry then, but in various key officials and positions

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:10.920
[Guest]: and ministries from 77 to 79, many people were sympathetic to an RSS worldview got it.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:15.360
[Guest]: And even during the Vajpayee time, we forget this now, because we sometimes romanticize

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:21.840
[Guest]: the Vajpayee period. The HRD minister was my friend, Murali Manohar Joshi, who's, I

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.960
[Guest]: mean, I said this about him to his face, so I can say this again, that most politicians

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:31.120
[Guest]: set out to make history. He's the only chap I know who set out to rewrite history. I mean,

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:36.000
[Guest]: his entire mission was not to do anything of any note himself, but to rewrite what people

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.600
[Guest]: had done before. And he and Uma Bharti was briefly his minister of state, legitimized

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:48.800
[Guest]: the writing of history in a way that played down Muslim achievements, played up Hindu

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:54.160
[Guest]: achievements. If you look at it, this is now a very fashionable controversy in Sanghi circles.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:59.520
[Guest]: If you look at the story of the Indus Valley civilization, about which we really don't

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.560
[Guest]: know very much, and we have always wondered if those people were Hindus or they weren't

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.440
[Guest]: Hindus. I mean, maybe they were, maybe the statue of what looks like Shiva in his Pashupati

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:15.720
[Guest]: pose is really Shiva. Maybe it's a precursor of Hindus, we don't know. But it was during

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:21.280
[Guest]: Dr. Joshi's time that it became the stated policy of the Sanghi elite to claim that the

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:28.000
[Guest]: Indus Valley civilization was a Hindu civilization. It was not an Indus Valley civilization, Dr.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.560
[Guest]: Joshi said repeatedly, it was a Saraswati civilization created on the banks of the Saraswati

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.840
[Guest]: River, which no longer exists now. And it was built by Hindus. And I could never really

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:43.480
[Guest]: understand it. And I used to say to him, how does it matter whether they were Hindus, whether

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:48.640
[Guest]: they had some pre Hindu religion, whether they were Dravidians, whether they were Aryans.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:53.040
[Guest]: And it was only much later I realized what they were building up to. They were building

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:58.960
[Guest]: up to saying that all Muslims were invaders, and therefore not true Indians. Now you had

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:04.600
[Guest]: a problem because the Indus Valley civilization from all accounts was a pre Aryan civilization.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:09.040
[Guest]: So if you accepted that, then you had to accept that the Aryans were the first people who

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:14.160
[Guest]: came in, possibly through invasion, otherwise through migration. He didn't say that at the

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:20.600
[Guest]: time. But now, when you see the controversies and you see the manufactured stuff about DNA,

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.400
[Guest]: et cetera, this is what they were building at. And it was, I think, in a way, done at

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:31.240
[Guest]: such a basic level that people like me, who, as you say, are blindsided, we didn't realize

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:35.840
[Guest]: what they were doing. That's when it began. That's when they started changing the whole

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:41.680
[Guest]: idea of history. We think that their motive is to erase memories of the Nehru's and the

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:46.160
[Guest]: Gandhi's and to portray them as crooks and all that, which I'm sure it is. But that is

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:51.720
[Guest]: not their primary agenda. Their primary agenda is to say that Hinduism is the oldest, greatest

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:57.600
[Guest]: religion in the world. We were always a Hindu nation. There was never a non-Hindu over here.

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:02.320
[Guest]: Hinduism grew in India. And anybody who came from outside, if it was a Muslim, he was an

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:07.880
[Guest]: invader. If it was a Christian, he was a toady of the East India Company or white people

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:14.360
[Guest]: because brown sepoy is such an insult in sanghi circles. So they started at that stage with

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:19.600
[Guest]: that kind of agenda. Not all of us have got it. And that agenda now, because it's been

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:24.600
[Guest]: taught in schools, because state governments rewrote history books, many of the teachers

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:29.240
[Guest]: who joined and they were appointed were RSS sympathizers, people like that. You have a

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:35.520
[Guest]: whole generation that's been brought up to believe that we were a vegetarian Hindu civilization

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:40.600
[Guest]: from time immemorial. And then these nasty Mughals arrived, killed our cows and turned

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:45.200
[Guest]: us into non-vegetarians. And we must always resist their influence. Oddly enough, the

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.560
[Guest]: Delhi Sultanate, the people who came before the Mughals, I don't think they're aware of

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.480
[Guest]: because they certainly don't mention them. They believe that Muslim rule in India began

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:57.600
[Guest]: with the Mughals. And it's frightening how many people who you would think would be brighter

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:02.720
[Guest]: than this actually buy into this vision of India. And this vision of India is the vision

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.880
[Guest]: of India they've picked up in the schools. It's the vision of India they've picked up

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:12.680
[Guest]: from their school teachers. And so when you have a class that has not ever subscribed

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:18.320
[Guest]: to the great secular liberal values that appeared to be the foundation of the new India, and

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:24.480
[Guest]: one that has been brought up on this RSS version of Indian history, it's not difficult to see

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:28.600
[Guest]: why secularism is in its death throes.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:33.280
[Amit Varma]: A number of ironies here. And one irony, of course, is that the real vision of the division

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:39.200
[Amit Varma]: of what India really was, is far more glorious than this artificial sort of made up vision.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I think the most glorious part of what makes us Indian is that we take influences

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.640
[Amit Varma]: from everywhere and make it our own. You know, this rich, delightful khichdi that we are

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:51.760
[Amit Varma]: right down to the, you know, the elegant churidar kurtas of a prime minister, which of course

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.520
[Amit Varma]: have an Islamic origin and practically all the food that we eat, you know, which is from

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:01.320
[Amit Varma]: outside. And I've of course had an episode on food with Vikram Doctor, you know, and

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:06.760
[Amit Varma]: none of that would be new to you. I also had episodes with Tony Joseph and Peggy Mohan.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:11.400
[Guest]: So you know the Indus Valley thing and the campaign of slander and calumny has been unleashed

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.520
[Guest]: against Tony and people who dared to tell the truth there.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:18.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, because I think this is one way in which the Sangh were blindsided, because their assumption

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.840
[Amit Varma]: was this history is so old that you can make up whatever you want, and then it becomes

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.680
[Amit Varma]: a battle between narratives. And suddenly there is science in the picture. Suddenly

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.680
[Amit Varma]: you actually have irrefutable scientific evidence that, hey, you know, these are the different

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:34.480
[Amit Varma]: times at which these migrations happened. And hey, the Indus Valley people might well

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:39.760
[Amit Varma]: have spoken in early precursor to Tamil, which is, by the way, an older language than Sanskrit.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.760
[Amit Varma]: And all of this, I think, would have blindsided those guys.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:47.800
[Amit Varma]: The other interesting thought that kind of comes up here is about the unintended effects

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:52.080
[Amit Varma]: of liberalization, which is almost ironic, because I, of course, I'm a big champion of

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:57.360
[Amit Varma]: liberalization and how it empowered millions of people and so on and so forth. But if the

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.400
[Amit Varma]: thesis is true that our elite was liberal and our society was not, then what the empowerment

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:09.280
[Amit Varma]: of the rest of society meant paradoxically is that becoming more liberal in, you know,

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:15.520
[Amit Varma]: at an economic level allowed the illiberalism at a social level to sort of express itself.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.760
[Amit Varma]: And that kind of became what it became. Like there's a great book, the sociologist Timur

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:24.200
[Amit Varma]: Kuran wrote in 1999 called Public Lies, Private Truths, where he coined this phrase called

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:29.280
[Amit Varma]: preference falsification. And his thing was that most people do something called preference

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:35.240
[Amit Varma]: falsification, where if they feel something that is apparently not acceptable in society,

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.040
[Amit Varma]: they won't say it. His example was you look at the downfall of the Soviet Union, where

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:43.880
[Amit Varma]: it appeared to happen overnight. But for decades, many people held a resentment against a state

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:47.200
[Amit Varma]: which they were afraid to express because they thought they'd get into trouble. That

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.040
[Amit Varma]: was preference falsification. But you reach a critical mass where you realize that, hey,

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:55.440
[Amit Varma]: many more people are like you. And that leads to a preference cascade and overnight things

00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:01.040
[Amit Varma]: change. And I think in a sense, social media especially exacerbated that as many people

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:05.800
[Amit Varma]: who felt a particular way and not to get judgmental, I mean, of course, I disagree with a lot of

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:10.080
[Amit Varma]: what comes out of there, but not to be judgmental about that. But they felt X, they thought,

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.280
[Amit Varma]: oh, you know, this is a liberal secular country, we are not supposed to feel X. And they realize,

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:20.360
[Amit Varma]: hey, everybody feels X. And it kind of just explodes from there. So just a whole bunch

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:23.680
[Amit Varma]: of ironies there. Before we go on to talking about politics,

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.880
[Guest]: Can I just add one more thing? Sure.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:32.640
[Guest]: When we talk about these people who say Muslims are invaders, and Savarkar was God descended

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:41.160
[Guest]: to us, etc. We use terms like liberal and conservative, or left wing or right wing.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:46.520
[Guest]: And when you actually look at the issues on which there is a difference, the way in which

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:51.240
[Guest]: you define a person who's not a liberal in India, and the way you define a person who's

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:57.200
[Guest]: allegedly right wing in India is not economic. Mr. Modi's governance is much more left wing

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:02.440
[Guest]: than say, Manmohan Singh's was, so it's not. So what is it? Ultimately, this whole distinction

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:09.440
[Guest]: comes down to just one issue, how you look at Muslims. If you take away the Hindu Muslim

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:16.080
[Guest]: distinction, what is the right wing left with? There is nothing. It's essentially this ideology,

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:21.720
[Guest]: the Indian right wing, the ideology is based on nothing more than the sense of othering

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:27.440
[Guest]: the Muslim. And as part of the process of othering the Muslim, creating a great Hindu

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.960
[Guest]: nation in its mind. Now, the irony is that there is a great, great

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:36.560
[Guest]: Hindu heritage in India, just as there is a great Muslim heritage in India. But the

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:41.720
[Guest]: great Hindu heritage that really happened, that really existed, doesn't seem to worry

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:47.520
[Guest]: them at all. They don't even seem aware of it. They feel it necessary to create a bogus

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:53.680
[Guest]: Hindu heritage, in which Ganeshji was made what he is by plastic surgery, in which Rishi

00:49:53.680 --> 00:50:01.440
[Guest]: Munis went around on aeroplanes, in which there was Ram Rajya all over. It's not even

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:08.120
[Guest]: history, it's mythology. And if you take away that mythological heritage, and the hatred

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:13.200
[Guest]: of Muslims, there really isn't an ideological plank at all. Whereas if you look at say the

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:17.640
[Guest]: liberal positions, the values, the beliefs and freedom of expression, freedom of speech,

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:23.640
[Guest]: freedom of religion, there is no counterpart on the other side. It's only, only about hating

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:29.280
[Amit Varma]: Muslims, which is what's worrying. Yeah, no, absolutely. As Arun Shourie famously

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.280
[Amit Varma]: said, in fact, NDA is equal to UPA plus cow. So I agree, it does come down to that. And

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:39.160
[Amit Varma]: it's ironic that Modi should fulminate so much against Nehru and Indira because he has

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:43.960
[Amit Varma]: totally adopted Nehru's top-down status thinking right down to, you know, import substitution

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:48.840
[Amit Varma]: becoming made in India and Atmanirbhar and whatever. He's totally been inspired by Indira

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:54.120
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi's authoritarianism and her ways. One feels that sometimes he almost envies the

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:57.640
[Amit Varma]: kind of power that she had and so on and so forth.

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:02.280
[Guest]: I sometimes feel that if Sanjay Gandhi had lived, he would have been like Narendra Modi

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:09.000
[Guest]: yesterday. He's pretty much in continuation of that strand. He's not in continuation of

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.640
[Amit Varma]: the Vajpayee Advani strand at all. Yeah, absolutely. And it's ironic that, you

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.600
[Amit Varma]: know, every time Sanjay Gandhi's birth anniversary or death anniversary comes up, the Congress

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:21.520
[Amit Varma]: will tweet out, you know, celebratory tweets of what a great man he was. And I'm like,

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:26.080
[Guest]: this is another rewriting of history happening. I mean, he was a monster. And this leads me

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.480
[Amit Varma]: to then, therefore, to another thought, which is that, you know, the German political theorist

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:35.240
[Amit Varma]: Carl Schmitt had once spoken about how in politics to be successful, you need an enemy,

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:40.200
[Amit Varma]: you need an other, right? Which, as you pointed out, you know, Shourie said NDA is equal to

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:44.400
[Amit Varma]: UPA plus cow. He made cow the symbol of that. You're saying it's hatred of Muslims, which

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:49.320
[Amit Varma]: it absolutely is. I did an episode with Akshay Mukul on his great book about the Gita Press,

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:53.680
[Amit Varma]: which kind of spoke about how all of these things, cow slaughter, love jihad, they've

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:59.680
[Amit Varma]: been around for decades and part of politics. Now, if you look at Indian politics, it would

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:03.880
[Amit Varma]: seem that till the BJP came up, perhaps not, because who was really the other. But on the

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:08.400
[Amit Varma]: other hand, I think an argument could be made, and I'm thinking aloud again, that what really

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:13.200
[Amit Varma]: happened at independence was you had one big party, that was the Congress. And you had,

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.360
[Amit Varma]: in a sense, decades of inertia, minor little tactical skirmishes here and there. But what's

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:23.440
[Amit Varma]: this kind of politics, in your view, always inevitable? Because, you know, you rise in

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.640
[Amit Varma]: politics, you get the vote out, so to say, you mobilize your basis by whipping up hatred

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:33.360
[Amit Varma]: against the other. It's much easier to do it that way than to talk vaguely about abstract

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:38.060
[Amit Varma]: notions of hope and togetherness. In that sense, would you say that politics like this

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:43.240
[Amit Varma]: was always sort of inevitable or is that falling prey to the hindsight bias? Are there different

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:45.200
[Amit Varma]: paths that could have been taken?

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:51.440
[Guest]: No, look, it would be foolish to deny that there were always Hindu-Muslim tensions. If

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:56.700
[Guest]: there were no such tensions, there would be no Pakistan today, there would be no partition.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:03.680
[Guest]: But equally, once we got on with the task of creating India, after 1947, tensions between

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:08.880
[Guest]: Hindus and Muslims, the proportion of Muslims who felt strongly that there were illities

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:13.080
[Guest]: in India, the proportion of Hindus who felt that no business being there was relatively

00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:19.560
[Guest]: small. If you look at the history of the RSS, which dominated this kind of thinking, it

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:26.120
[Guest]: really wasn't a significant factor in Indian political life. The first time the RSS begins

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:34.160
[Guest]: to matter is around 75, 76, maybe 74, when Jayaprakash Narayan ignores the advice of

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:39.000
[Guest]: all his colleagues and says, the RSS are wonderful chaps and we must use them in the fight against

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:45.200
[Guest]: Indira Gandhi. And from then on, there's been no looking back for the RSS. The Jansang stroke,

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:53.680
[Guest]: which became the BJP, on the other hand, has never had it that good. In the 1984-85 election,

00:53:53.680 --> 00:54:01.080
[Guest]: Rajiv Gandhi won that huge slide. Charan Singh got three seats, the BJP Jansang it was then,

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.000
[Guest]: though they called themselves the old Jantarbati, effectively, they were the Jansang. They got

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:11.560
[Guest]: just two seats. So as recently as that, there was no evidence that they existed. Now, there

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:16.840
[Guest]: are two theories for how they took off. And both, I think, have some element of truth.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:22.560
[Guest]: One is that Advani was able to pick up on the resentment amongst Hindus. And that resentment

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:27.880
[Guest]: was exacerbated by what they saw as a lack of growth. There were other resentments, which

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:32.960
[Guest]: were all mobilized under the Hindu umbrella. I have a slightly, which I mean, it's true,

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:38.080
[Guest]: there's no doubt about it. I have a slightly different theory, which is not, I think, contradictory

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:43.880
[Guest]: to this one, which is that the Hindu vote actually comes about in India in the early

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:49.920
[Guest]: 1980s, when the Sikh agitation starts. Until that point, there had always been Hindu-Muslim

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:56.000
[Guest]: tensions. But most Hindus had always regarded Sikhs as being brothers, as being almost Hindus

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.920
[Guest]: in the way that Hindus regard, say, Jains as being almost Hindus. When that turned violent,

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:06.040
[Guest]: when the Sikhs turned against Hindus, and though we airbrushed this out of history,

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:11.360
[Guest]: there were massacres of Hindus. They would stop buses and segregate the Hindu and Sikh

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:18.120
[Guest]: passengers and kill the Hindus. Many important Hindu newspaper owners, leaders, politicians

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:24.240
[Guest]: were killed. I think that led to a certain amount of anger within the Hindus of India.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:29.280
[Guest]: And if you look at the way in which we reacted to Blue Star, which I opposed at the time,

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.720
[Guest]: there was so much triumphalism that now we would call Hindu triumphalism. There was a

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:39.920
[Guest]: sense of we've taught these guys a lesson. It got increased after Mrs. Gandhi's assassination.

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:45.320
[Guest]: I do not for a moment dispute that the Delhi riots were led and organized by Congress leaders.

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:50.400
[Guest]: That the people who took part and the people who supported it weren't all congressmen.

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:55.120
[Guest]: They were also ordinary Hindus who seem to think, as people do in communal riots, that

00:55:55.120 --> 00:56:00.960
[Guest]: this was not such a bad thing. I think that Hindu backlash, that Hindu vote contributed

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:07.400
[Guest]: to Rajiv Gandhi's huge, huge election victory in 84, 85. Nobody had that, and he could not

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:12.200
[Guest]: have done it, I don't think, if the Hindus had not voted for him. People forget this,

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:21.360
[Guest]: that in 84, 85, the RSS backed Rajiv Gandhi. Nobody from the RSS went out to campaign for

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:27.400
[Guest]: BJP candidates. The BJP did very badly. Atal Bihari Vajpayee lost his own seat.

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:34.200
[Guest]: So there was that opportunity from 85 to 89 for the Congress to decide what it wanted

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:39.400
[Guest]: to do with the Hindu vote. If you spoke to people like Arun Nehru at that stage, they

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:44.680
[Guest]: believed that they could harness the Hindu vote and use it for constructive purposes.

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:49.600
[Guest]: You could say this is an oxymoron, but this was genuinely Arun Nehru's view. It wasn't

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:53.960
[Guest]: the BJP that opened the locks of the Babri Masjid. It was the Congress government. It

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:59.400
[Guest]: was, from all accounts, Arun Nehru, who then looked after UP, who gave those instructions.

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:04.920
[Guest]: Arun Nehru wanted then for the Congress to become the party of the Hindus, not in a bad

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:10.520
[Guest]: way, he said, not in a way that meant you attacked Muslims or whatever. Rajiv Gandhi

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:14.920
[Guest]: did not agree with that or wasn't even happy with that. If you look at the things Rajiv

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:20.920
[Guest]: Gandhi did, Shah Banu, the ban of the Satanic Verses, those were maybe Shah Banu slightly

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:25.000
[Guest]: more significant, but Satanic Verses was a book that now the Hindus were outraged about

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.760
[Guest]: it and now the Muslims are outraged about it, was ever going to read. But it was symbolism.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:36.040
[Guest]: It was impossible after the way Rajiv Gandhi had behaved on those issues for any Hindu

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:40.840
[Guest]: to suggest that the Congress was a Hindu party. By this stage, even Arun Nehru had been thrown

00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:47.920
[Guest]: out. So Rajiv turned his back on the Hindu vote. Where was it going to go? And I think

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:54.080
[Guest]: Mr. Advani saw it, saw the opportunity, and then capitalized on it, weaponized the whole

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:59.840
[Guest]: Ayodhya agitation, and began the BJP's rise to fame. Even then, during the Narasimha Rao

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:04.800
[Guest]: period, there were elections, state elections held after the demolition of the Babri Masjid,

00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:09.960
[Guest]: and the BJP was defeated in all of them. So it was still a kind of thing that could have

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:16.240
[Guest]: gone either way. But as the Congress became more and more aggressively secular, as more

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:22.720
[Guest]: and more people joined the middle class, as there was much more money with newly-enriched

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.680
[Guest]: Hindus, I think that Hindu wave grew.

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:31.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and that narrative in your book about the 84 election onwards was quite fascinating.

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:35.320
[Amit Varma]: And as you pointed out, most people don't realize that when the BJP was formed, Vajpayee

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:39.760
[Amit Varma]: gave these vague talks of Gandhi and socialism, quote unquote, and all of that, and they kind

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.840
[Amit Varma]: of moved away from that strand. I did an episode with Vinay Sitapati recently, who wrote the

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:49.840
[Amit Varma]: book on the BJP before Modi. And his thesis, which you add a lot of nuance to and even

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:54.880
[Amit Varma]: contradict at points, his thesis was that, look, you know, it was a Congress which went

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:59.360
[Amit Varma]: after the Hindu vote in the 80s, and the BJP realized they have to compete and then they

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:03.880
[Amit Varma]: went after it also. And they had to go to an extreme because that was the only way they

00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:11.800
[Amit Varma]: could get ahead of the Congress. And the nuance you've added is that at the level of individuals

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:16.400
[Amit Varma]: that's not quite true, that Rajiv Gandhi actually stopped coating the Hindu wave, you pointed

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:22.200
[Amit Varma]: out he didn't even realize that the 84 win could have had the Hindu wave as a contributing

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:26.720
[Amit Varma]: factor. And he seemed to believe, and I presume there were others in the think tank at the

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:31.080
[Amit Varma]: time who believed that, listen, it is safer to go for the 11% Muslim vote or whatever

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:34.760
[Amit Varma]: that percentage was, because they will vote as a bloc, and the Hindu vote will always

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:40.760
[Amit Varma]: be splintered across caste line, which I kind of found interesting, just breaking up, you

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.440
[Amit Varma]: know, the different factions within the Congress that Arun Nehru believed this, Rajiv believed

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:48.520
[Amit Varma]: this and so on. But sorry, you were saying? I was saying that, I think the point Vinay

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:53.600
[Guest]: makes in his book is that we make this big contrast between Advani and Vajpayee. But

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:59.200
[Guest]: the truth is no secular person in that era would have joined the RSS, right? At least

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:06.400
[Guest]: not in the traditional definition of secular. So yes, Mr. Vajpayee also grew up from that

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:13.000
[Guest]: background. The difference, ultimately, between him and the average BJP person was he wanted

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.440
[Guest]: to have his cake and eat it too. He wanted the Hindu vote to get him into power. But

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:22.440
[Guest]: once he was in power, he wanted to be Jawaharlal Nehru. And he wanted to be much more statesman

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:27.320
[Guest]: like. And I think that was the inherent tension in the Vajpayee leadership between Vajpayee

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:32.760
[Guest]: and Advani. And it was not a sustainable situation. And it collapsed. And you had, I mean, BJP

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:37.520
[Guest]: is actually quite big on Nehru Gandhi idols. After Vajpayee's Nehru Act failed, you had

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:43.280
[Guest]: Mr. Modi with his Indira Gandhi Act and so far it's working. No, that's a very nice way

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.000
[Amit Varma]: of putting it that when he came to power, he wanted to be Nehru. And actually Vajpayee

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.720
[Amit Varma]: I think was an outstanding Prime Minister. I mean, one can quibble about small things,

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:56.120
[Amit Varma]: but on the whole, he was so different from what we have now. And so my next question

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:01.840
[Amit Varma]: is this that it is rational at that stage once Rajiv turns away from it and Arun Nehru

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.600
[Amit Varma]: eventually like you mentioned, ended up joining the BJP and then going back to the Congress

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.720
[Amit Varma]: and long story. But it's rational at that point for Advani and Vajpayee to quote the

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.680
[Amit Varma]: Hindu vote and go to whatever extremes that they were going. But were they riding a lion

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:18.280
[Amit Varma]: that they could not control? Like you point out and Vinay also points out in his book

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.720
[Amit Varma]: that after the Babri Masjid was demolished, Advani himself claimed to be blindsided by

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.400
[Amit Varma]: it. He broke out in tears. It wasn't what he intended. And one of the shifts that we

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:33.160
[Amit Varma]: see in Jan Sangh slash BJP, that whole thing is that each leader is kind of more extreme

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:38.400
[Amit Varma]: than the previous guy, that Advani seems more hardline than Vajpayee, then Modi comes, maybe

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:43.280
[Amit Varma]: Adityanath is next. And I have actually entered a lot of these right wing rabbit holes in

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.280
[Amit Varma]: a sort of fascination these days, where you have people not only saying that Modi has

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.420
[Amit Varma]: let the Hindus down, but Adityanath is too moderate, you know, and it seems to be getting

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:56.560
[Amit Varma]: more and more extreme. And you would imagine that in these times, for someone to rise within

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:01.040
[Amit Varma]: a party like that, you can't rise by being a moderate, you rise by being an extremist

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:05.960
[Amit Varma]: and holding everyone to purism tests and all of that. And therefore, a party will naturally

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:11.800
[Amit Varma]: get more and more extreme till the point that it splinters. So what do you think of this

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:12.800
[Guest]: thesis?

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:17.760
[Guest]: No, I actually agree completely with you. I think when you go down this path towards

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:24.400
[Guest]: one, there's a slightly loaded terms, but communalism, intolerance, etc. It's a slippery

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:31.520
[Guest]: slope. Because how much intolerance is enough? If you can say that we should do this to Muslims,

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.240
[Guest]: the next guy will come along and say, no, no, why don't we go further? It's a little

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:40.680
[Guest]: bit like being an alcoholic or a junkie. In the beginning, a couple of drinks is enough.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:45.560
[Guest]: But as time goes on, you need the whole bottle and then the whole case. So I think that is

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:51.080
[Guest]: the danger with the BJP. And in many ways, oddly enough, as bizarre as this sounds, the

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:57.800
[Guest]: hope for Indian inclusiveness, because the more extreme it gets, it will begin to turn

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:04.320
[Guest]: people off. And as you say, it will splinter. I think a leader like Mr. Modi, who has the

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:11.080
[Guest]: ability to control the whole party, to tell the RSS where to get off, is what, once in

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:17.280
[Guest]: a century leader? Advani or Vajpayee couldn't tell the RSS where to get off. Mr. Modi has

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.800
[Guest]: that kind of power, that kind of charisma. You can argue about how he acquired it, how

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:26.640
[Guest]: much is manufactured, but let's not dispute that he has. But once that goes, and once

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:33.160
[Guest]: people start saying, he's let the Hindus down, he's not gone far enough, Yogi is much better,

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.520
[Guest]: or saying that Yogi is now being captured by power, he's forgotten his roots, which

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.960
[Guest]: is beginning to happen. I don't see how the BJP can survive as a coherent force.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'm reminded of this, and this doesn't seem apropos, but I'm just reminded of something

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:52.000
[Amit Varma]: that a journalist friend of mine, Rishi Majumdar once told me, where he was once lynched. And

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.160
[Amit Varma]: lynched, by the way, doesn't mean a crowd kills you, the crowd beats you up basically.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:59.800
[Amit Varma]: So he was once lynched. And he explained to me the anatomy of how lynchings absolutely

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:05.240
[Amit Varma]: occur. And after that, I kind of read up on this and realized that there's a common pattern

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.360
[Amit Varma]: to it, which is that it's not as if somebody goes up to you and they start beating you

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:14.440
[Amit Varma]: immediately and everybody just comes and starts beating you. There are two dynamics at play

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.440
[Amit Varma]: here. One is that typically what happens is that a bunch of people will come and talk

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.560
[Amit Varma]: to you and there'll be an argument and blah, blah. And you'll be fighting with a bunch

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:26.760
[Amit Varma]: of people, arguing with a bunch of people. And then somebody who isn't part of that argument

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:31.240
[Amit Varma]: will just decide to take it into his own hands, come from outside, give you one back, and

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:35.800
[Amit Varma]: then others join in. And then there is this phenomenon where everybody has a threshold

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.640
[Amit Varma]: for joining in the violence. There are people who if they see one other person hit you will

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.840
[Amit Varma]: get emboldened and hit you. There are others who will hold out till 10 people do that or

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.880
[Amit Varma]: 20 people do that or 100 people do that. But at some point, everybody in the crowd is kind

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:56.120
[Amit Varma]: of baying for blood, which, you know, metaphorically does sound like the way a lot of things kind

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120
[Guest]: of.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.360
[Amit Varma]: That's actually a very, very good parallel. It's exactly right. Yeah.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:03.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. So let's kind of take a quick commercial break. And on the other side of the break,

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.200
[Amit Varma]: there's lots to talk about.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:10.960
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it? Well, I'd love

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.680
[Amit Varma]: to help you. Over the last few months, I've enjoyed teaching my online course, the art

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:19.680
[Amit Varma]: of clear writing, and an online community has now sprung up of all my past students.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.960
[Amit Varma]: We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students and vibrant community

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:29.240
[Amit Varma]: interaction that offers much stimulation, and even some comfort in these difficult times.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:33.840
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:38.600
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises, much interaction,

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.720
[Amit Varma]: and a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs rupees 10,000 plus

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:49.800
[Amit Varma]: GST or about $150. And the August classes begin on the 7th of August. So if you're interested,

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:54.640
[Amit Varma]: head on over to register at indiancut.com slash clear writing. That's indiancut.com

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.720
[Amit Varma]: slash clear writing. Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:05.160
[Amit Varma]: to work hard and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills. I'd like

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.360
[Amit Varma]: to help you.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.440
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Veer Sanghvi about his exciting

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:16.480
[Amit Varma]: life which somehow you know, the title of your book A Rude Life is really not appropriate

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:20.840
[Amit Varma]: because you know, what you define as rudeness is really asking provocative questions once

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:25.560
[Amit Varma]: in a while to important people and rudeness has taken on just an entirely new dimension

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.160
[Amit Varma]: in the modern age. But leaving that aside, you know, we were chatting about politics

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.720
[Amit Varma]: before the break, and I'll come back to politics later. But I kind of want to go back now to

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:38.920
[Amit Varma]: your personal journey. How important were books and reading to you? I remember reading

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:44.400
[Amit Varma]: you from the 1990s. I can't recall what your writing was like then, but I really enjoyed

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.280
[Amit Varma]: Sunday I thought they had the best political coverage and so on. And I always enjoyed your

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:55.360
[Amit Varma]: writing in the sense that you always had this clear, lucid style, without any sense of,

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:59.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, the pros being labored or a lot of the problems that you typically would find

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:04.080
[Amit Varma]: with Indian journalism. So, you know, I know your dad was a writer, he wrote articles and

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:09.160
[Amit Varma]: columns and a bunch of books. So what kind of stuff did you read back in the day? And

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.600
[Amit Varma]: did you have aspirations of being a writer? What was your perception of yourself when

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.600
[Amit Varma]: you were a kid?

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:20.680
[Guest]: Well, I used to read a lot, I think mainly because my family used to read a lot. I didn't,

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:25.640
[Guest]: I mean, I never really got to the stage where I read lots and lots of literary books. It

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:32.560
[Guest]: was Agatha Christie and Perry Mason and spy thrillers and stuff like that, which I enjoyed

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:39.400
[Guest]: John le Carre stuff. But I think a stage came, a phase came, when I stopped reading that

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:46.320
[Guest]: much fiction. Most of my, I still read a hell of a lot, but most of my reading now is nonfiction.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:52.800
[Guest]: And my wife, who reads lots and lots of fiction, always says that people who read fiction generally

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:58.600
[Guest]: have bigger imaginations. They have a bigger sense of what people are like, a more creative

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:05.520
[Guest]: worldview. Fortunately, I don't have that. I enjoy reading nonfiction. I read biographies,

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:12.600
[Guest]: I read lots of political books. I enjoy learning things. And pretty much everything I do from

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:18.680
[Guest]: food to whatever, I've learned from books. So books have in a sense, made me what I am,

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:24.200
[Guest]: though they're not necessarily great classic novels or whatever, just biographies, accounts

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.200
[Guest]: of what has happened. That's the kind of stuff I read.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:31.320
[Amit Varma]: And that kind of gets me to thinking because obviously, you know, Agatha Christie, Perry

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:36.120
[Amit Varma]: Mason, I'm in my late 40s, so maybe about a decade and a half younger than you. And

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:40.480
[Amit Varma]: I've had other guests on the show of a similar age, or older than me. And we'll all talk

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:44.560
[Amit Varma]: about kind of the same kind of books, because in India, you had a restricted supply of books

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.920
[Amit Varma]: that you can get. So it's all your Annette Blytons and Hardy Boys to begin with, you

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:52.280
[Amit Varma]: read a lot of Woodhouse, you even listen to the same bands as you go through college,

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:56.600
[Amit Varma]: and it's all restricted. And obviously, it's a bad thing that is restricted. And one celebrates

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:01.800
[Amit Varma]: everything that is available today. But what that also does is that I have the sense that

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:07.120
[Amit Varma]: there are common reference points that I can have with someone say, a couple of decades

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:11.760
[Amit Varma]: older than me or a decade younger than me. But today, those reference points have vanished

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.040
[Amit Varma]: that whereas you had people who were born in maybe four decades reading the same people

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:21.320
[Amit Varma]: listening to the same stuff, having the same kind of cultural checkpoints, that's no longer

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:26.540
[Amit Varma]: the case. Is that something you feel and is there a disconnect there between our generation

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:30.960
[Amit Varma]: and and the generation today, not just in the sense of a standard disconnect between

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.820
[Amit Varma]: every generation, but particularly so like, you know, one of the guests who had appeared

01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:41.160
[Amit Varma]: on a podcast I produced Brave New World had mentioned how it's a bit of an illusion that

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:46.120
[Amit Varma]: people will know history better or will have a wider set of references because everything

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.080
[Amit Varma]: is available for free on the internet. He pointed out that studies show that most people

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:55.360
[Amit Varma]: are actually consuming what was produced in the last three days, whether it's on YouTube

01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:00.240
[Amit Varma]: or podcasts or whatever. So is that something that you noticed because you are actually

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:05.520
[Amit Varma]: a media person yourself in that sense. And the way people consume media, discover media,

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.400
[Amit Varma]: filter media, it's just changed completely.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:13.360
[Guest]: Yeah, I think also, first of all, people don't read books in the way they're supposed to.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:18.560
[Guest]: I mean, publishers will tell you that book sales are up and it's one thing that survived

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:23.280
[Guest]: the collapse of media, it may well be true in terms of figures. But I find fewer and

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:28.760
[Guest]: fewer people seem to read books and you're right, there are no reference points. The

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:34.600
[Guest]: good thing for me about the internet is the mountain of information and background it

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:39.300
[Guest]: provides. If you want to find out about something, you go on the internet, you find articles

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:45.440
[Guest]: from six years ago, seven years ago, you learn, you read. But that unfortunately, as you say,

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:51.520
[Guest]: is not how people are consuming the internet. People see the internet as being a guide to

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.880
[Guest]: the here and now. And therefore, the more topical it seems, the more sensational it

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:02.520
[Guest]: seems, the more fun it seems, the more likely they are to go on the net. When it comes to

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:09.200
[Guest]: nonfiction, which is the kind of stuff I read, I find that younger people are much less interested

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:15.680
[Guest]: in nonfiction books, unless it can be shown that it will help them. So if somebody does

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:22.200
[Guest]: a book on learning from startup geniuses on how to become a millionaire at 22, young people

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.680
[Guest]: read it, they won't learn anything, they won't become startup geniuses, but they will feel

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:31.440
[Guest]: that it is something that's actually going to help them. The sense and it's ironic, we've

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.480
[Guest]: never had so much information available for free for so many people. The sense that learning

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:40.040
[Guest]: is worth it for its own sake, I find is disappearing.

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:44.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I'll just produce a counterpoint to that because having kind of presented the

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:49.320
[Amit Varma]: negative view, the positive view is something that I discovered to my surprise, like, you

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.440
[Amit Varma]: know, I had the publisher VK Karthik on my show a year and a half back, and she spoke

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.000
[Amit Varma]: about how book sales are, you know, exactly what you said, they're doing fine. And my

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.840
[Amit Varma]: sense there is that there has always been a small group of people in every generation

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.800
[Amit Varma]: who read and that group will continue being whatever percentage it is. So your book sales

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.840
[Amit Varma]: will stay where what they are. The question is, what are the others doing? But you know,

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:12.600
[Amit Varma]: when I started this podcast, I had the impression that people have short attention spans, they

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.800
[Amit Varma]: don't want depth, you got to be topical, you got to keep episodes to 20 minutes, I even

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.080
[Amit Varma]: had a nine minute episode. With time, I realized that I was completely wrong about that. And

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:24.080
[Amit Varma]: part of that is, of course, the nature of the medium that people listen to podcasts

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.640
[Amit Varma]: when they're a captive audience, like when they're commuting or working out or doing

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:31.880
[Amit Varma]: errands, they listen to it at higher speeds, usually double speed or more, you know, good

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.920
[Amit Varma]: taking it one step up at a time and getting used to it. So captive audience listening

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:41.280
[Amit Varma]: faster. But most importantly, the third point why this longer length really kind of became

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:46.600
[Amit Varma]: popular is that people crave depth, that, you know, we seem to, I think, judge social

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:50.840
[Amit Varma]: media. And I know I certainly made this mistake, that you see vocal minorities out there who

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:54.720
[Amit Varma]: are getting shriller and shriller, and you assume that everyone is like that, and there's

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.960
[Amit Varma]: so much shallowness and all of that. But there is a silent majority out there, which one

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:03.080
[Amit Varma]: is not part of those polarized discourse, which might watch it with bemusement, but

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:09.080
[Amit Varma]: not participate, which is why silent majority. But there is a craving for knowledge and part

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:14.000
[Amit Varma]: of the craving for knowledge is because the rest of the media has actually abdicated because,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.440
[Amit Varma]: you know, whether you're looking at television or newspapers or whatever, they are, as a

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.520
[Amit Varma]: friend of mine Prem Panicker puts it, they are a mile wide and an inch deep. And part

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.000
[Amit Varma]: of that is, of course, economic imperatives, right? If you've paid a huge license fee to

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.520
[Amit Varma]: buy an FM station or a news channel or whatever, the costs are so high, you have no option

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:35.600
[Amit Varma]: but to cater to the lowest common denominator. So someone who actually comes out and provides

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.640
[Amit Varma]: deep content, that there is a hunger for it, which struck me. And one of the memes that

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:45.960
[Amit Varma]: happens on my show is that I have exhaustive show notes where I recommend books and my

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:50.920
[Amit Varma]: guests recommend books more importantly. And there is this meme of seen in the unseen bookshelves

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.120
[Amit Varma]: where people will post pictures on Twitter of books they've bought, you know, having

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:58.880
[Amit Varma]: discovered them from my show. So there is this irony that there is this hunger, there

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:04.120
[Amit Varma]: is this content out there. How do you discover and filter this content? And my show kind

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:09.120
[Amit Varma]: of filled a fortuitous kind of gap. But I think that there is something there that media

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.480
[Amit Varma]: has missed, that the way that we consume and discover and filter information and knowledge

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:19.520
[Amit Varma]: has changed completely. And a traditional media hasn't kind of kept up with it. So a

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.720
[Guest]: bit of a ramble on my side, but what are your thoughts?

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:27.000
[Guest]: No, it's actually a fascinating ramble. I know your show is very, very successful because

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.840
[Guest]: people quote it all the time. But like how many people listen to say the average episode?

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, in a good month, I'll have a total downloads of 180,000.

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:44.520
[Guest]: So now 180,000 is more than any magazine or newspaper, anybody in India is able to manage.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:48.320
[Amit Varma]: Let me elaborate on that, if I might interrupt, because someone who might hear that figure

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.280
[Amit Varma]: might say that hey, YouTube videos have 2 million, 3 million views.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.560
[Amit Varma]: No, that's very different.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:58.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's very different. Because on YouTube, your average viewing time of a video may be

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.840
[Amit Varma]: 15 seconds, 20 seconds, whatever, you know, my average session is 40 minutes. And this

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:07.240
[Amit Varma]: is something it's not just my podcast, other great long form podcasters have also discovered

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:12.400
[Amit Varma]: that the level of engagement is far greater. And when I say the average session is 40 minutes,

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:16.240
[Amit Varma]: people will listen to an episode in multiple sessions and all of that, the level of engagement

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:23.800
[Amit Varma]: is far greater. And that translates to a much deeper sort of involvement, not just with

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:27.280
[Amit Varma]: the podcaster with whom you'll often feel this intimate connection, because you have

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:33.120
[Amit Varma]: their voice in your head all the time. But also, you know, all the rabbit holes you enter

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.120
[Amit Varma]: because of them.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:39.080
[Guest]: No, I think maybe you've got me thinking, I think maybe you're right, maybe I'm falling

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:46.120
[Guest]: into the trap of looking at YouTube and Twitter, and taking this superficial view of the loudest

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:51.680
[Guest]: parts of social media. And that there is something going on there, like say your podcast, other

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:58.400
[Guest]: long form podcasts, which show that it's wrong to just look at the loudest voice in the room,

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:02.440
[Guest]: look at the voice that people remember. So yeah, you're absolutely right. I will rethink

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.440
[Guest]: this one.

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:08.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, let's let's and we'll come to the media because I'd love your insights on many other

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:12.720
[Amit Varma]: aspects of it. But before that, let's continue your personal journey, which we keep getting

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:16.600
[Amit Varma]: sidetracked from because I keep digressing. A really fascinating part of your book is

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:21.960
[Amit Varma]: that after your dad died, you actually put yourself in school in the sense you went through

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.800
[Amit Varma]: the application process, you found yourself a school, you then found yourself college

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:31.960
[Amit Varma]: going to Oxford and everything. Tell me sort of about how that period was like, like at

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:36.840
[Amit Varma]: that point, what is your conception of yourself? When you put yourself through that grind through

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:41.160
[Amit Varma]: that education, you go to Oxford, you do a PPE. And you earlier pointed out that, you

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.000
[Amit Varma]: know, a lot of British Prime Ministers are still elites. And there is a traditional cliche

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.560
[Amit Varma]: about how all British Prime Ministers have done the PPE. I think Johnson also must have

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:54.160
[Amit Varma]: done the PPE. So perhaps you knew many prominent politicians personally. But at that point

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:57.880
[Amit Varma]: in time, when you're putting yourself through that, you obviously you're not, you know,

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:01.880
[Amit Varma]: a lot of what happens to you later seems to be serendipity. So what is your conception

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:05.880
[Amit Varma]: of yourself at that point? What is it that you want to be and where do you want to go?

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:11.960
[Guest]: Well, you know, my father had always said that I should go to a British university.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:17.520
[Guest]: And I think it may be because he went to Elphinstone College in Bombay. And he was very keen that

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:23.160
[Guest]: his son would have some of the advantages he didn't have. So it had been taken for granted

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:27.960
[Guest]: that I would go abroad to study, that I would go to an English university. What none of

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.120
[Guest]: us realized, I don't think he realized it either, was that you couldn't go, I couldn't

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.660
[Guest]: finish at Mayo and then go to university. When all my friends went to colleges in India,

01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:39.720
[Guest]: you had to go and do two years of school first and do what, I don't know if it's still the

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:47.440
[Guest]: same, were called A-levels. And that was complicated because I had to do this in a boarding school

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:52.480
[Guest]: and I didn't know how to organize it. So I went out and there was nobody else to do it

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.320
[Guest]: for me. So I went out and bought this book called the Public Schools Handbook, which

01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:00.200
[Guest]: I don't know if they're still published, probably on the net now. And I made a list of schools

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:05.440
[Guest]: that were near London because I didn't want to go to a very conservative school because

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:11.240
[Guest]: all my friends were in college anyway. So I found this one, which was 20 minutes on

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:16.440
[Guest]: the tube from the center of London and was large and seemed quite cool. So I wrote off

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:21.680
[Guest]: to it as I had written off to many other schools. And then I finally called and they were very

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.600
[Guest]: sniffy and they said, people have registered for so many years and your term begins in

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:31.760
[Guest]: October, we're already in April. And it was just my good luck, I think I've just right

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:37.000
[Guest]: place, right time. Good luck. I found a principal who was willing to listen to me. He said,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.240
[Guest]: come and see me. He came and I went and saw him. He had me interviewed by the head of

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.240
[Guest]: his history department and the head of his English department. English department was

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:51.720
[Guest]: fine. The history department, I sort of did a bit of jugaad. I said, I've only studied

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.880
[Guest]: Indian history. So he had to ask me questions about Indian history, which he was not good

01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:59.520
[Guest]: at. So I could have said anything. I could have said Akbar was Baba's father and I would

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:03.560
[Guest]: have got away with it. But they agreed to admit me on the spot, which I thought was

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:09.000
[Guest]: really, really cool. It doesn't happen even in India. It was just a principal there was

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.680
[Guest]: willing to take a chance on somebody from outside. And it's probably because I went

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:20.280
[Guest]: to that school that I got a sense of being able to fit into England without ever fitting

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:24.300
[Guest]: in, in the sense that it wasn't Eton or it wasn't Harrow. Harrow was one of the other

01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:29.320
[Guest]: options because it was near London. Eton was Windsor, so which is not far from London.

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:33.600
[Guest]: So those were options, but somehow I didn't actually want to go to Eton and wear a tailcoat

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:38.280
[Guest]: and a mortarboard and a white bow tie. And I didn't want to go to Harrow and be part

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:42.840
[Guest]: of some glorious English tradition, which I have nothing in common with. So this suited

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:49.280
[Guest]: my purposes. That was a school that was liberal, that was happy to have me, that was near enough

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:54.760
[Guest]: London and I had a great time. And I think I learned, I mean, I dare I say this, I learned

01:19:54.760 --> 01:20:01.360
[Guest]: more at that school than I learned at Oxford. In Oxford, because the system then was that

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:06.720
[Guest]: you had tutorials in which you wrote an article or an essay and your tutor disagreed with

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:11.440
[Guest]: you or agreed with you and made you defend that essay. I think I learned how to write,

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:17.360
[Guest]: oddly enough, and I learned how to argue. PP, which you mentioned that all politicians

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:23.160
[Guest]: do is less a degree than a flag of convenience for people who want to do other things while

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:29.720
[Guest]: they're at Oxford. So I was not overly academic at Oxford. I did economics, I did all kinds

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:35.800
[Guest]: of politics, most of which I don't remember. But what I do remember is the arguments with

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:41.320
[Guest]: tutors, the way in which you take apart somebody's argument, the way in which you construct an

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:46.040
[Guest]: argument. And you are you asking about how I write and whether I've always written like

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:50.640
[Guest]: that? I think I write like that because of the training of those years, though I was

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:56.720
[Guest]: doing academic essays, I was taught, and I think I say this to everybody, when you write,

01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:02.520
[Guest]: it isn't how you write. It isn't the big words or the complicated constructions. It is the

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:10.200
[Guest]: ideas. Ultimately, all articles or all essays are vehicles for ideas. So unless you have

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:15.280
[Guest]: at least one idea in your thing, and you are able to get it across, there's no point writing

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.720
[Guest]: an article. I mean, unfortunately, many of us try and make things that are clever or

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:26.200
[Guest]: that are funny or that are witty. Just try to simply get the idea across and you're done.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:30.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and there's a fascinating part of your book where you're interviewing for a college

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:36.040
[Amit Varma]: in Oxford and you point out how your interviewer asks you, so would you say you were a Keynesian

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:40.200
[Amit Varma]: or a monetarist, Mr. Sanghvi? And your reply is, my teachers are Keynesians. I have no

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:44.520
[Amit Varma]: strong views on the subject. I am hoping to make up my own mind once I get here and discuss

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.720
[Amit Varma]: it with economists like you. On the one hand, it's obviously a very, you know, a practical

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:54.640
[Amit Varma]: and jugaroo answer where, you know, you're not pushed into a corner. But also, you know,

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:59.840
[Amit Varma]: it indicates a bent of mind where you're careful at arriving at worldviews. So what was your

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:05.160
[Amit Varma]: journey towards forming a worldview? Because I think what often happens in one's teenage

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:10.520
[Amit Varma]: years is that you are entranced by the seductive appeal of simple ideas which seem to explain

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:16.000
[Amit Varma]: everything. And simple ideas can explain everything in a wrong way also, you know, and the world

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
[Amit Varma]: is much more complex than that. And it is over a period of time that you start figuring

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.280
[Amit Varma]: that out. So what was your process like of arriving at worldviews? Did you change your

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:29.760
[Amit Varma]: mind? Were there significant ways in which you changed your mind? And also, this also

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.600
[Amit Varma]: strikes me as important because all this is your schooling, your college is happening

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:39.320
[Amit Varma]: through the 70s at a time where, you know, India is going deeper and deeper into a form

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:45.880
[Amit Varma]: of statism that is harming the economy, that is harming society, all of those things. So

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:51.280
[Amit Varma]: not only are you sort of being educated in a universe of ideas, but you're also looking

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:56.200
[Amit Varma]: at your own country from the outside, and therefore are not sort of hostage to the received

01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:00.240
[Amit Varma]: wisdom of the time as you might have been in India. So what is sort of this process

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:04.840
[Amit Varma]: like of discovering what you think and how you think and then how you view India?

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:09.800
[Guest]: That's actually a very, very interesting question. Because I mean, in terms of the Keynesian

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:16.440
[Guest]: and monetarist thing, it was simple. I recognize the question for what it was. It was an invitation

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:22.360
[Guest]: to enter a trap. If I said, no, I am a Keynesian, he would have said, but Keynes has said this,

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:26.720
[Guest]: and Keynes has been wrong on this. So how would you define? I had no effing clue of

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:31.200
[Guest]: what Keynes had said or whatever. So the best thing to do was to give, as you say, this

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:37.240
[Guest]: Jugaadu answer and not be led into that trap. On a more serious note about how I looked

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:42.680
[Guest]: at India, I don't know if it's still true. I suppose it is still true that whenever any

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:50.520
[Guest]: Indian is abroad, he or she becomes a hyper patriot. You go and people criticize India,

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:54.840
[Guest]: and then you feel bad that they're criticizing India, and you look for ways to defend your

01:23:54.840 --> 01:24:01.120
[Guest]: country. And in the 70s, not that many British people knew that much about India. They thought

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.680
[Guest]: we were a poor and primitive country and were astonished to find someone like me who could

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:11.520
[Guest]: maybe hold my own with them, could speak English as well as them or whatever. And so that made

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:16.560
[Guest]: me, I think, some kind of super patriot in a way that I perhaps wouldn't have been if

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:24.240
[Guest]: I wasn't at home, a sort of my country, right or wrong. And that lasted, I think, until

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:33.080
[Guest]: 76. In 75, when Mrs. Gandhi declared the emergency, and the whole world condemned it, I was actually

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:38.000
[Guest]: really shocked. It never occurred to me that there could be press censorship in India,

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.440
[Guest]: that the entire opposition could be locked up, all basically say one woman's share. But

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:48.320
[Guest]: when people started criticizing India and criticizing the emergency, there was some

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:54.240
[Guest]: knee jerk response, where I felt obliged to defend the emergency. And to say it wasn't

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:58.400
[Guest]: such a bad thing. And you have to look at what's happening in India. And I mean, really

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:04.440
[Guest]: pathetic arguments in defense of what was probably indefensible. And then in 76, I came

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:09.240
[Guest]: back to India in my gap year. And I spent some time and that was the same time as the

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:15.920
[Guest]: rise of the notorious Mr. Sanjay Gandhi. And anybody who had any sympathy for Indira Gandhi

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.000
[Guest]: during that period, lost it. Because this thug like motor mechanic son of hers could

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:27.200
[Guest]: not be imposed on the country as her successor. So when I went back to England, I was in this

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:33.360
[Guest]: extraordinary position, where I still felt I was obliged to defend India. And yet, I

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.400
[Guest]: did not feel I could defend what was happening in India. So I walked the sort of middle path.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:43.160
[Guest]: You must remember also, I've written that in the book, that I came from a progressive

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:48.040
[Guest]: background. My father was a communist, even when he abandoned communism, and communism

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:53.760
[Guest]: abandoned him. He still had this progressive, vaguely lefty view of the world, illogical

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:59.160
[Guest]: that might have been, but it was still a lefty view. It came from a lefty place. And as Mrs.

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:04.800
[Guest]: Gandhi had framed the emergency in terms of fighting vested interests, and I'd believed

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:10.160
[Guest]: in 1971, when Mrs. Gandhi split the Congress and won a mandate for herself, that this was

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:15.920
[Guest]: a good thing for India, vested interests, the syndicate had been defeated. And staying

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:21.920
[Guest]: away and having some sense of distance and looking at what was happening, gave me an

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.800
[Guest]: interesting perspective. I stopped defending what was happening in India, with quite the

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:33.440
[Guest]: same enthusiasm. And I began looking at what Mrs. Gandhi was doing, and being horrified.

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:38.400
[Guest]: And then when Janata was elected, I thought it was a great thing, Janata government would

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:43.800
[Guest]: last forever. We had a paper in, at Oxford, I did one, which is called the politics of

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:50.160
[Guest]: developing countries. And one of my teachers, a guy who taught me South Asian politics,

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:58.320
[Guest]: a man called Gopalakrishnan, Dr. Gopalakrishnan, and his view was that Janata would last forever.

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:03.360
[Guest]: Basically political science is a way of doing journalism with big words. So it was like

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:08.760
[Guest]: the Kulaks, who are the local notables, who had been sidelined by Indira Gandhi, have come together

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:13.640
[Guest]: and formed the Janata party, and they have roots in the villages that Mrs. Gandhi doesn't,

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:17.960
[Guest]: and this kind of crap. And I remember, I was quite taken in by it, I have to say, though

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:24.000
[Guest]: I call it crap now, that one of the papers I did in my finals, the question is, the developing

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:30.800
[Guest]: countries was, there is no reason to believe that Janata is any more than a nine day wonder

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:34.760
[Guest]: in the history of Indian politics. And of course, I gave him the whole Gopalakrishnan

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:40.400
[Guest]: thesis that Janata will go on forever, and there is no problem. And I took my exam, and

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:46.000
[Guest]: I went back to India, and the Janata government fell. And then I was called back to Oxford

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.400
[Guest]: for a viva, which is what you get when you say, not good enough for a first, but slightly

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.200
[Guest]: better than a second, then they talk to you and decide whether you're really worth the

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.760
[Guest]: first. So they asked me then to defend this question. And there was no way I could defend

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:04.280
[Guest]: it. And that was the end of my first division. I went back with the second division. But

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:09.440
[Guest]: yes, you're right. If you have that perspective, and you look at India, and you've been brought

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:15.920
[Guest]: up to be broadly sympathetic of what Indira Gandhi was doing, that whole emergency period

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:20.560
[Guest]: made you look at India differently. It made you look at what was happening. Nobody was

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:25.680
[Guest]: thrilled about the RSS joining, or the Jansan joining the government. But you kept thinking

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:30.160
[Guest]: that the Congress can't run the government forever. There has to be some alternative.

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:35.480
[Guest]: And when there wasn't, when Mrs. Janata collapsed, and when Mrs. Gandhi was re-elected, I remember

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:39.560
[Guest]: being profoundly depressed.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:44.260
[Amit Varma]: So take me through your early years in journalism, because even while you were still in college,

01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:48.120
[Amit Varma]: you kind of became a journalist, you became an editor at one point where, you know, first

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:51.260
[Amit Varma]: you start with the India Today group, then you talk about how you set up their magazine

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:57.120
[Amit Varma]: Bombay in Bombay. So tell me a little bit about that, because is that something that

01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:02.280
[Amit Varma]: you had given thought to about journalism itself, what it involved, what it implied?

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:06.960
[Guest]: I was very clear that I wouldn't be a journalist, which is why, though various job offers, Inder

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.960
[Guest]: Malhotra, who was a friend of my parents, had suggested I join the Times of India, which

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.800
[Guest]: he was an assistant editor at the time. Various people had done it. And I don't know if you

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:20.300
[Guest]: remember what papers were like in those days. But if you were an assistant editor at one

01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:25.700
[Guest]: of the big newspapers, it meant you got a cabin, you got paid quite well. And you sat

01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:29.900
[Guest]: in there and you wrote these leaders, these editorial page articles, and then you went

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:30.900
[Guest]: home.

01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:35.100
[Guest]: And you really had nothing to do with the famous story, which I'm sure is untrue, about

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:41.140
[Guest]: Shyamlal, who was a legendary editor of the Times of India, going out to a gathering and

01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:45.900
[Guest]: meeting a man who said lots of things. And Shyamlal was very impressed. And he said to

01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:50.260
[Guest]: the man, you seem very well-informed. What do you do? And this chap said, sir, I'm your

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:55.700
[Guest]: news editor. But that is the extent to which the news side and the editorial side would

01:29:55.700 --> 01:30:00.620
[Guest]: divorce from each other in those days. And the guys who wrote the editorials looked down

01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:05.620
[Guest]: the chap who actually did the journalism, who actually produced the newspaper.

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:11.540
[Guest]: So I rejected that option of becoming that kind of editorial page writer. As I say in

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:16.020
[Guest]: the book, writing for India Today happened because they were desperate. There was nobody

01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:21.420
[Guest]: to write for them. I was unemployed. I was there waiting to go up to Oxford. And I was

01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:26.100
[Guest]: cheap and I was young and I was bushy. And I was able to get them interviews and nobody

01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:31.540
[Guest]: else would. And then they kept at it. So if that had not happened to me, if I hadn't kept

01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:37.460
[Guest]: up with India Today, then I think I probably would never have become a journalist.

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:43.900
[Amit Varma]: And at this point, how does one form a conception of good journalism? Where are the role models?

01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:48.900
[Amit Varma]: Because in India, journalism, I have actual memories of journalism only from the 80s,

01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:54.540
[Amit Varma]: but it was horrendous. It was so bad. So what are your role models? How do you arrive at

01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:58.220
[Amit Varma]: a set of values in terms of what you do in your reporting? How do you arrive at a set

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:03.380
[Amit Varma]: of values about the language itself, which I remember as being incredibly poor even in

01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:08.180
[Amit Varma]: the 80s and the 90s. And you also described in your book at different times in Sunday

01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:14.060
[Amit Varma]: and Hindustan Times. Yeah, it was it was so horrendous. I mean, you mentioned how the

01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:20.100
[Amit Varma]: Hindustan Times was described by people as an English paper written in Punjabi.

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:24.660
[Guest]: I mean, yeah, I searched for an answer to that question because there were very successful

01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:31.220
[Guest]: journalists in my early years. It was Arun Shourie who invented investigative journalism

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:37.860
[Guest]: for India. There was M.J. Akbar, who with the original Sunday was a firebrand editor

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:44.140
[Guest]: who created a new kind of journalism. So there were these people, but almost all of them

01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:49.220
[Guest]: were people who took a position. Now, we talk about Ram Nath Goenka and we talk about his

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:53.940
[Guest]: battles with the government. And I knew Ram Nath Goenka quite well. There was no doubt

01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:58.580
[Guest]: that even as he was fighting with the government or whatever, he was doing it from a particular

01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:04.420
[Guest]: political position. He was committed to destroying the Congress and helping his friends in the

01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:09.740
[Guest]: opposition come to power. If you went to his penthouse, which I did, you met people like

01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:16.100
[Guest]: Guru Murthy, who was then just an RSS guy, and various other opposition, Mrs. Sindhia,

01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:20.500
[Guest]: Mrs. Vijayraja Sindhia, who would all sit and complain about the Gandhi's and what they

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:25.060
[Guest]: could do, how they could change things. And afterwards, when he turned against Rajiv and

01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:29.460
[Guest]: against Zerubai Ambani, it would be full of those plots. So, I mean, I liked him a lot

01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:35.020
[Guest]: and I admired him enormously. But this was, was this a role model? I don't know. It was

01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:41.300
[Guest]: journalism done with a purpose to achieve a purpose. So should journalism be done by

01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:46.700
[Guest]: that? Or should it be much more neutral or much more open? Akbar, for instance, his the

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:52.660
[Guest]: slogan he chose for his Sunday, I think it was, was strong views strongly expressed.

01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:59.180
[Guest]: He was very clear which side he was on. So I was a little uncomfortable with all of these

01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:04.540
[Guest]: obvious role models. There was much to admire in them. And I did admire them. But they did

01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:09.620
[Guest]: not seem to me to fit what I wanted to do. I wanted to write about things. I mean, you

01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:14.420
[Guest]: will have a certain bias, because you will be biased towards liberal values or whatever,

01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:19.660
[Guest]: but not a sort of party political bias. I want to write about things generally. And

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:24.980
[Guest]: Arun Puri, in many ways, came closest to that, because I started my career, working for India

01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:31.620
[Guest]: today. And Arun was a printer, he had no experience with journalism. And when he got into it,

01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:36.460
[Guest]: he just read and read. And he evolved a way of doing things. There used to be a series

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:41.660
[Guest]: of books by Harrod Evans on being a journalist, one of which was called Newsman's English,

01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:46.180
[Guest]: which Arun made all of us read. Another one on photojournalism was called Pictures on

01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:52.580
[Guest]: a Page, how you use photographs. Arun made all of us read that. His idea was always don't

01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:57.860
[Guest]: look for role models in India. Try and learn from the best in the world. And I think to

01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:00.540
[Amit Varma]: some extent, I went with him.

01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:04.980
[Amit Varma]: And you sort of brought up the normative question of, you know, in a rhetorical sense, you asked,

01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:08.940
[Amit Varma]: is this what journalism should be? And that leads me to a question of what should journalism

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:13.300
[Amit Varma]: be? Because on the one hand, you know, we have talks about the ethical values of journalism

01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:17.460
[Amit Varma]: that you speak truth to power and, you know, you afflict the comfortable and comfort the

01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:21.580
[Amit Varma]: afflicted and all of those cliches. And these are the values separation of news and opinion

01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:27.940
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth. At the same time, you have these imperatives, which often drive

01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:32.660
[Amit Varma]: businesses in undeniable ways, such as just a profit motive, or you could be in a country,

01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:36.100
[Amit Varma]: for example, where a government can put an enormous amount of pressure on you and that

01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:41.660
[Amit Varma]: becomes an imperative. There are the individual incentives of journalists themselves. So when

01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:47.380
[Amit Varma]: we speak of sort of the higher ethical values of journalism, much as you know, the Hippocratic

01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:51.260
[Amit Varma]: Oath is for doctors, is there something to that or are we fooling ourselves?

01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:57.740
[Guest]: Yeah, look, in an ideal world, everybody would want those absolute ethical values to be maintained

01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:04.820
[Guest]: by every publication. But in the real world, journalism is always a high wire act, or a

01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:11.260
[Guest]: trapeze act. Because there are always in any newspaper or publication, so many different

01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:16.100
[Guest]: interests. There's the government, which is nearly always putting pressure on you. There

01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:21.740
[Guest]: is the owner. And in India, we don't have corporate ownership as much as individual

01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:27.260
[Guest]: ownership. Owners nearly always want the papers to be seen as their papers. So you have to

01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:33.620
[Guest]: keep that you have to maintain that you have often the owner's commercial interests. Because

01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:38.740
[Guest]: most people in the business also have other interests, which they are not willing to endanger

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:45.340
[Guest]: just because you want to write a column. So you have to worry about that. You also increasingly,

01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:48.900
[Guest]: and the Times of India was a good example, because I joined it because the owners never

01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:55.140
[Guest]: wanted to be high profile. They had no political loyalties. They tried to produce a paper that

01:35:55.140 --> 01:36:00.420
[Guest]: was free of any kind of bias. And yet you had then internally another kind of trapeze

01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:07.100
[Guest]: act, because they saw the paper not as a means of fulfilling some higher social obligation,

01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:12.620
[Guest]: but as a business. Asked by the New Yorker a decade ago, about what he did, Vineeth Jain

01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:17.660
[Guest]: said, we are in the advertising business. The Times of India was very clear that it

01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:23.740
[Guest]: existed because advertisers needed a medium to reach readers. And the Times of India provided

01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:29.740
[Guest]: that medium. If along the way it could bring enlightenment and entertainment on that, that's

01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:34.600
[Guest]: very good. But there was never any doubt about what its primary purpose was. I mean, if the

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:40.100
[Guest]: ad department calls the shots, then is that still this high ethical form of journalism?

01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:46.140
[Guest]: So because there are so many competing pressures, some internal, some external, all journalism

01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:51.860
[Guest]: ultimately is a trapeze act, a high wire act. You get in there, you try and tell the truth,

01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:56.400
[Guest]: you try and write the truth, but you can, it's never an absolute thing. You can never

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:59.460
[Guest]: succeed all the time. You do the best you can.

01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:04.660
[Amit Varma]: There's this amusing anecdote in your book about, you know, when Narsimha Rao was prime minister

01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:09.220
[Amit Varma]: at one point, you know, when you were in Sunday, you wrote, quote, the key to understanding

01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:13.340
[Amit Varma]: Narsimha Rao lies in recognizing that he is a small time manipulator who masquerades as

01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:15.060
[Amit Varma]: a statesman. Stop quote.

01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:21.660
[Guest]: Yes, indeed. Yes. First line and the very first counterpoint I wrote.

01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:25.860
[Amit Varma]: And then, you know, your publisher, Avik Sarkar, you know, wants something out of Narsimha Rao

01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:29.580
[Amit Varma]: when he goes to Delhi and Narsimha Rao saying, why have you come to me? I am a small time

01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:34.380
[Amit Varma]: manipulator, some passive aggressive thing like that. So that's sort of a classic example.

01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:38.620
[Amit Varma]: You've also given a good breakdown of how the newspaper model, instead of being subscription

01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:42.740
[Amit Varma]: driven became advertising driven. So you could basically give it away for close to free,

01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:46.020
[Amit Varma]: but you were catering to the lowest common denominator and you just wanted.

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:51.580
[Guest]: And to the interest of the advertisers. Because your ultimate customer was not your reader.

01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:53.300
[Amit Varma]: It was the advertiser.

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:58.140
[Amit Varma]: It was the advertiser. Exactly. And the other thing that strikes me here is that when I

01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:03.340
[Amit Varma]: look at modern times, for example, it strikes me that a lot of the dissenting voices in

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:09.740
[Amit Varma]: today's journalism in India are small independent folks, you know, who haven't been around for

01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:13.460
[Amit Varma]: that long, which brings to mind that old line from rock and roll, if you ain't got nothing,

01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:17.500
[Amit Varma]: you got nothing to lose. I think it was Dylan. So, you know, the scrolls and the wires and

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:21.380
[Amit Varma]: all of that might take their dissenting lines because they are small, whatever. But when

01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:25.020
[Amit Varma]: you look at the larger newspapers, they're not just standalone newspapers. They're part

01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:29.840
[Amit Varma]: of industrial houses. Somebody who's running a newspaper could be running a chemical factory.

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:33.460
[Amit Varma]: And if the government of the day does an IT raid there, there's just too much to lose.

01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:37.740
[Amit Varma]: There's too much at stake. So at some level, you almost understand that there's a fear

01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:42.620
[Amit Varma]: of the stake. And then there is also the carrot. If you're an industrial house, which owns

01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:48.300
[Amit Varma]: certain publications or media houses, obviously you're incentivized to stay with the government

01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:53.060
[Amit Varma]: line to push those narratives to not cross certain boundaries. Do you see some truth

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:54.060
[Guest]: to this?

01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:59.300
[Guest]: No, absolutely. Without a doubt. I think if a government wants to put pressure on the

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:05.940
[Guest]: newspaper house, it can do it without any talk of censorship or whatever. All it needs

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:12.580
[Guest]: to do is to ensure that the business interests of the owner are not favoured, that permissions

01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:17.860
[Guest]: are not given, that say a pollution inquiry is started. I mean, everybody did this. I

01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:24.220
[Guest]: remember during the Vajpayee government, the owner of Outlook had many investigations started

01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:28.100
[Guest]: on him. They didn't touch Outlook because, of course, they respected the freedom of the

01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:32.860
[Guest]: press, but they went for the proprietor. And ultimately, as Vinod Mehta, my friend, writes

01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:38.540
[Guest]: in his autobiography, it had to have some impact. He doesn't like hanging around in

01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:43.100
[Guest]: enforcement directorate offices, that smell of urine, being kept waiting for hours, being

01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:48.580
[Guest]: humiliated. And he begins to wonder, why am I letting my editors have so much freedom?

01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:55.940
[Guest]: What am I getting out of it? So yes, all governments, at some level, put pressure on journalists.

01:39:55.940 --> 01:40:00.780
[Guest]: And often this pressure comes through their proprietors.

01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:04.220
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I mean, just looking back in the past decades, and I'm obviously not privy

01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:07.580
[Amit Varma]: to the inside story of what happened. But you see this in different governments, like

01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:11.780
[Amit Varma]: in the UPA time, you see Raju Naresh Satti, you know, leaving Mint because apparently

01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:15.460
[Amit Varma]: Chidambaram, who was then finance minister, got upset at something. Similarly, later,

01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:20.140
[Amit Varma]: you have, you know, Bobby Ghosh having to leave as editor of the HD because Arun Jaitley

01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:26.060
[Amit Varma]: reportedly got upset at something. You know, are there incidents that you feel free to

01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:30.140
[Amit Varma]: talk about of this sort that have happened in the past that kind of illustrate this?

01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:35.860
[Guest]: Well, the HD examples are a problem for me because I cannot divulge what either of any

01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:41.660
[Guest]: of the principles have told me. But I mean, it goes far back. Prem Shankar Jha, I think

01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:47.340
[Guest]: had to leave the HD because Rajiv Gandhi objected to something he had told VP Singh, and we're

01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:52.580
[Guest]: sticking with the HD, without things that I was personally privy to. Khushwant Singh

01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:58.460
[Guest]: was appointed, KK Birla writes in his own autobiography, by Sanjay Gandhi, who said

01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:03.980
[Guest]: to him that, I hear you have vacancy for an editor. And he said, Yes, I do. And he said,

01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:08.900
[Guest]: Okay, I have a candidate for you. And so KK Birla says who? And he said, Meneka. And so

01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:13.580
[Guest]: even KK Birla finds that this is a bit much to bear. So he thinks, he goes away and thinks

01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:17.420
[Guest]: about it says he will think about it comes back and he says, I'm sorry, I don't think

01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:22.980
[Guest]: this will work. Fine, Sanjay, appoint Khushwant Singh. And Khushwant Singh is promptly appointed.

01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:27.580
[Guest]: I mean, that happened all the time in newspapers during that era.

01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:31.900
[Amit Varma]: So is it the case and this might seem a pessimistic view that is it the case that those who are

01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:35.700
[Amit Varma]: dissenting today are able to do so because they are too small, no one really cares about

01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:39.220
[Amit Varma]: them that if they get beyond a certain level of influence, say if they're right outside

01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:42.500
[Amit Varma]: the elites, they'll just be struck down. And there are so many tools.

01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:48.180
[Guest]: Look at the wire, which is so one of the dissenting voices, they've done everything possible they

01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:54.080
[Guest]: can to try and shut the wire down. There have been all kinds of cases, there have been investigations,

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:59.300
[Guest]: look at NDTV, which isn't even a particular dissenter or whatever, the kind of ordeal

01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:04.780
[Guest]: it's had to go through. So sometimes if you're lucky, and you're strong, you survive the

01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:08.860
[Guest]: ire of the government, most times you decide it's not worth it.

01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:12.620
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's a note of hope. And of course, the wire has been leading the way with the

01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:17.060
[Amit Varma]: Pegasus revelations, for example, very bravely, Danik Bhaskar just got raided, and they've

01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:18.060
[Guest]: sort of been...

01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:22.420
[Guest]: Everybody kept saying when Danik Bhaskar was doing those COVID stories, how do they hope

01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:27.980
[Guest]: to get away with it? And the answer was, they were waiting for the COVID crisis to pass

01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:32.420
[Guest]: and for the government to seem on a stronger wicket before coming down on them. And now

01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:33.420
[Guest]: they have.

01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:40.580
[Amit Varma]: Amazing. Let's sort of talk about the changing media landscape over this entire time. Like

01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:45.500
[Amit Varma]: one thing that was certainly true till the end of the 90s, maybe even for the first few

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:49.900
[Amit Varma]: years of this millennium was that there was something called mainstream media, there was

01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:54.380
[Amit Varma]: a consensus on the truth that, you know, you might have different papers have different

01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:59.100
[Amit Varma]: characters in some small ways, but broadly, there is a consensus on the truth on what's

01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:04.060
[Amit Varma]: going on. And most people are getting their information, their knowledge from a small

01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:09.740
[Amit Varma]: set of sources. Today, that's completely splintered. Now, one, it's a good thing that is splintered,

01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:13.340
[Amit Varma]: because you know, with the means of production becoming available to anyone, more and more

01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:18.220
[Amit Varma]: people can enter the fray as creators, as indeed I have with my blog earlier in the

01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:25.020
[Amit Varma]: podcast today. But the other side to that is that then there, a lot of that consensus

01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:29.900
[Amit Varma]: on the truth has vanished, that nothing is mainstream anymore, everything is splintered.

01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:35.500
[Amit Varma]: Like, just yesterday, I read this interview of Steve Van Zandt, who was a founding guitarist

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:41.260
[Amit Varma]: of the E Street Band with Bruce Springsteen, Little Steven. Yeah. And Van Zandt was saying

01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:45.860
[Amit Varma]: in that that rock is no longer mainstream. And his point was that rock becoming mainstream

01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:50.500
[Amit Varma]: was an aberration. It began when Dylan went electric, according to him, and it ended when,

01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:54.980
[Amit Varma]: you know, Kurt Cobain killed himself. And whatever the timelines might be, I mean, obviously,

01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:58.860
[Amit Varma]: they're gradual processes. But his point was that rock is not mainstream. And when I think

01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:03.500
[Amit Varma]: about that, nothing in music is mainstream, whether in, you know, to entertainment to

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:07.700
[Amit Varma]: some extent, because the means of distribution has still haven't opened up, even if the means

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:12.020
[Amit Varma]: of production have, there is something called a mainstream and whatever. But in media, there

01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:16.980
[Amit Varma]: probably isn't. If anything, there are platforms that are mainstream, like a YouTube or a Twitter

01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:21.500
[Amit Varma]: or a Facebook or whatever. But the conception of the mainstream is changing, people get

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:26.340
[Amit Varma]: their information from different sources and all of that. Now, the significant chunk of

01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:31.980
[Amit Varma]: your career was spent within institutions, which were sort of mainstream institutions

01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:37.220
[Amit Varma]: doing traditional things. And the landscape has so completely changed, sort of in the

01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:44.660
[Amit Varma]: last 10 years. So, you know, has this made you redefine, has this made you rethink rather,

01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.020
[Amit Varma]: the things that you do, the things that you want to do, the kind of things that give you

01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:55.580
[Guest]: satisfaction? Yeah, I mean, I think all of us have had to find ways of adjusting to the

01:44:55.580 --> 01:45:03.980
[Guest]: changing medium. So while I do, I do the root food column for the Hindustan Times branch,

01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:09.820
[Guest]: my political column appears on ht.com, and reaches many, many more people than it would

01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:14.540
[Guest]: have in many, many parts of the world than if it just appeared in a print thing. So I've

01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:22.700
[Guest]: tried as much as possible to do things that are accessible to people in a variety of ways.

01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:28.180
[Guest]: I started my own YouTube channel about eight years ago. I think it was too early, I was

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:32.740
[Guest]: just crap on YouTube. So the channel wasn't a great success. But I've tried very hard

01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:38.300
[Guest]: to get into that. I started my own website where everything I write about, where everything

01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:44.620
[Guest]: I write, appears in 2008, which I think was slightly ahead of the curve. So I've tried

01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:53.260
[Guest]: to keep up as much as possible with changing media. I find now that my online stuff usually

01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:58.980
[Guest]: gets much more noticed, has much more impact than something I would write, say, on the

01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:06.420
[Guest]: editorial page of a newspaper, or as a column in a magazine. So you try, I think, to adjust

01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:12.540
[Guest]: to different ways of getting your message across. A lot of the stuff I've done on television,

01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:18.260
[Guest]: I think, works best, because we will no longer watch television that much in real time, works

01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:25.780
[Guest]: best in YouTube or stuff like that. One of the things I run, I'm a founder of, is a company

01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:31.740
[Guest]: called Easy Diner, which is an online restaurant platform, which is based on the internet,

01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:36.740
[Guest]: where you can do your bookings and all of that on the internet. So I think probably

01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:42.500
[Guest]: earlier than most journalists, I embraced the internet and the sense in which things

01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:49.660
[Guest]: had changed. Have I started an all proper internet venture of my own, whatever? No.

01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:54.140
[Guest]: Would I have, apart from the Easy Diner within mainstream journalism, would I have if I was

01:46:54.140 --> 01:47:00.500
[Guest]: 15 years younger? I think I would almost certainly have done it. But when you're 65, you have

01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:07.780
[Guest]: less and less urge to set up new organizations, to manage teams of people, etc. You're much

01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:13.260
[Guest]: happier being the sort of position I am, where I anchor television shows, and I write books,

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:19.140
[Guest]: and I do columns, and nice people like you invite me to come on and hold forth. But yes,

01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:22.220
[Guest]: I would have done things very differently if I was younger.

01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:26.300
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of questions, which I think are actually the same question. And the first

01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:32.140
[Amit Varma]: one is that, does the media then need to consider the way that it does everything? Because it

01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:36.180
[Amit Varma]: seems to me that, you know, whenever change happens, there is a lag between the change

01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:41.140
[Amit Varma]: actually happening, and traditional corporations kind of figuring out what the change is and

01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:45.980
[Amit Varma]: how to deal with it. For example, I think, you know, a lot of the newspapers, people,

01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:50.020
[Amit Varma]: they get the circulation because of inertia. Ki ghar pe aata hai, and therefore, you know,

01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:53.420
[Amit Varma]: you may not even look at it, but you have your three, four newspapers coming every day.

01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:57.820
[Amit Varma]: And that's kind of it. But as we discussed earlier, the way people discover content,

01:47:57.820 --> 01:48:02.780
[Amit Varma]: filter content, consume content has changed completely. And it seems to me that none of

01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:07.140
[Amit Varma]: the traditional media houses have really figured that out. You know, they will have a checklist

01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:11.500
[Amit Varma]: of things they will do where they can tick boxes like Instagram pe presence hona chahiye,

01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:15.740
[Amit Varma]: have a Twitter presence, have a this presence, do, you know, stories on Instagram, all of

01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:22.700
[Amit Varma]: that. But they haven't really adopted their fundamental ways of working. And the second

01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:26.580
[Amit Varma]: question which feeds into this is, if you were 15 years younger, or 20 years younger,

01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:31.980
[Amit Varma]: or 25 years younger, what would you start? What are the learnings about the media landscape

01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:36.740
[Amit Varma]: and about society which you would incorporate into starting something in the media today?

01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:43.020
[Guest]: It is true. Three answers to the question. The first one, is it a good thing that the

01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:49.620
[Guest]: media landscape is fractured? And there aren't just this oligopolistic control of a few media

01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:55.620
[Guest]: houses? Yes, I think absolutely. I used to always say, about India, that freedom of the

01:48:55.620 --> 01:49:03.140
[Guest]: press is guaranteed to anyone who happens to own one. But the point is now, unlike then,

01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:06.620
[Guest]: you don't have to own one, there are ways of getting your message across. So that's

01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:12.220
[Guest]: a good thing. The bad part of it is for better or for worse, most traditional media had certain

01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:17.680
[Guest]: norms in the way in which information was checked, in the way you tried to do things

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:23.260
[Guest]: that were responsible. In a splintered landscape, there will always be people who will do things

01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:28.580
[Guest]: without any of these checks and filters, who will do things for clickbait. So you have

01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:34.760
[Guest]: to balance out the advantage and the disadvantage. That's one question. The second one on what

01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:41.540
[Guest]: I would do, if I was 15 years younger, I would almost certainly have started an opinion website.

01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:46.660
[Guest]: I think there is a need for an opinion website. Many people tell me that the internet, only

01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:51.660
[Guest]: an investigator website or a website that tells people something they don't know would

01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:56.100
[Guest]: work. I don't know if that's true. But I genuinely think that the level of commentary

01:49:56.100 --> 01:50:03.420
[Guest]: in newspapers has sunk pretty low. That in many cases, because people are scared of getting

01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:08.480
[Guest]: commentators who will say things that are unpopular or whatever, they fall back on the

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:14.700
[Guest]: coward's option of getting academics to write vaguely obscure articles on their specialities.

01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:18.780
[Guest]: I have nothing against academics writing articles that they write very well. But when it is

01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:24.380
[Guest]: done to avoid getting proper commentators to comment on current events, then I don't

01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:29.140
[Guest]: think it works that well. So I still think that there is room for a website that had

01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:36.380
[Guest]: a lot of opinion. Your third question about newspapers and the web. Yeah, I think almost

01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:41.020
[Guest]: all newspapers in India realized 20 years ago that the internet was going to be the

01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:47.700
[Guest]: next big thing. Almost all of them started newspaper sites and almost websites and nearly

01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:53.580
[Guest]: all of them screwed it up. I think there is something in their mentality that stops them

01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:58.980
[Guest]: from understanding. I know that traditional, I mean, I've heard, because we've been around

01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:05.860
[Guest]: so long, I've heard so much crap about integrated newsroom and a guy will come in and he will

01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:10.380
[Guest]: go straight to our radio station and he will talk about it. Then he will do a piece to

01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:15.220
[Guest]: camera. Then he'll come back and he'll write the story for the internet. And then the evening

01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:20.940
[Guest]: he'll file for the newspaper. I mean, millions have been invested in these ventures. Nothing

01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:25.880
[Guest]: has ever come of it. As far as I know, no newspaper organization in India has succeeded

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:31.980
[Guest]: doing anything like it. Abroad, papers like the New York Times have had much more success

01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:36.980
[Guest]: doing things like this. I pay a subscription to read the New York Times on the net every

01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:43.220
[Guest]: day. Would I necessarily pay the same subscription for an Indian newspaper? I don't know. I don't

01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:48.740
[Guest]: think so. There's never that kind of content that strikes me as being unusual or worth

01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:53.700
[Guest]: reading. Among Indian news sites, the one I would probably subscribe to, though fortunately

01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:58.420
[Guest]: it's free, is the NDTV app because that does tell you pretty much everything you need to

01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:04.620
[Guest]: know quite quickly. In fact, when I've often been a guest on various news discussion shows,

01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:09.260
[Guest]: I've quickly cogged and seen what the NDTV app is saying about 10 points about the budget

01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:14.780
[Guest]: or whatever. So I can seem clever and knowledgeable. So yes, some things have that work, but nothing

01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:19.900
[Guest]: that anything, nothing on the net that anybody in mainstream media has done that I can think

01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:25.700
[Guest]: of at all impressed me. It's a case of vast organizations throwing vast resources at the

01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:27.780
[Guest]: vast world and coming up with nothing.

01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:33.140
[Amit Varma]: No, that's very well put. And I agree completely. And it's interesting that you said an opinion

01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:38.820
[Amit Varma]: website because I think that one thing that people do hunger for in this age of ubiquitous

01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:43.180
[Amit Varma]: knowledge all around them, one thing that they do hunger for is perspectives. And I'm

01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:47.580
[Amit Varma]: reminded of this shout out to my friend Shaquille who keeps telling me that I should start something

01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:53.220
[Amit Varma]: like Persuasion, which is a newsletter magazine of sorts started by Yasha Monk in the US.

01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:56.940
[Amit Varma]: And they've got a bunch of great writers for them. The other thing, and I'll just kind

01:52:56.940 --> 01:53:00.580
[Amit Varma]: of think aloud and share my thoughts on it and tell me if this is something that has

01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:06.620
[Amit Varma]: struck you because it's something that kind of took me by surprise is the sort of intimacy

01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:12.540
[Amit Varma]: that a new content creators can now find. For example, here's a metaphor, let's say

01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:16.340
[Amit Varma]: you are, and I'll start with the visual arts, let's say you're in a cinema theatre and you're

01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:20.580
[Amit Varma]: watching a movie, and the screen is a certain distance away from you. And similarly, the

01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:24.420
[Amit Varma]: camera is a certain distance away from the actors, somebody's coming in on horseback

01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:28.020
[Amit Varma]: and then you get closer or whatever. If you make it a little more intimate, you have a

01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:32.260
[Amit Varma]: television screen, it's a couple of meters away from you. And the camera is also a couple

01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:36.620
[Amit Varma]: of meters away from the actors. So you'll have friends and Seinfeld and people in flats

01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:40.820
[Amit Varma]: and all that. YouTube brings it even closer, where you're sitting in front of a laptop

01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:45.700
[Amit Varma]: screen, which is a few inches away. And similarly, a lot of made for YouTube content is that

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:51.820
[Amit Varma]: close and that personal. Now, I got to thinking about this when I sort of took this to audio.

01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:55.620
[Amit Varma]: And I thought about how podcasts are different from radio like it is not true that podcasts

01:53:55.620 --> 01:54:00.740
[Amit Varma]: are only on demand radio in terms of access, that is true. But a fundamental way in which

01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:06.500
[Amit Varma]: this is differences radio because of all different kinds of incentives and imperatives has to

01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:10.500
[Amit Varma]: kind of go broad. So I think of radio, I think of driving in a car and the radio is on and

01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:14.540
[Amit Varma]: there's a song on and there's a limit to how deep you can go. When people speak, they will

01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:18.940
[Amit Varma]: speak in these artificial broadcast devices, they will project and so on and so forth.

01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:24.980
[Amit Varma]: But podcasting is intimate, there is someone's voice inside your head. And it's very personal.

01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:30.580
[Amit Varma]: And it's something I realized when gradually as my podcast grew, I began to realize almost

01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:37.300
[Amit Varma]: with a shock, how seriously people sort of take this relationship. And I'm starting with

01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:43.500
[Amit Varma]: my own example. But this is true of a lot of creators in the creator economy, not just

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:48.780
[Amit Varma]: in podcasts, but also on YouTube, where everything, in a sense, feels very personal, there is

01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:53.820
[Amit Varma]: a personal connect that wasn't there earlier. So earlier, if you enter television, you know,

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:58.520
[Amit Varma]: you have to learn certain skills of presenting yourself or what talking or whatever. If you

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:03.300
[Amit Varma]: get into say journalism, you have to learn the house style or whatever publication you're

01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:08.500
[Amit Varma]: writing for. But if you are a blogger, or if you are a podcaster, or if you are a YouTuber,

01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:13.980
[Amit Varma]: any of these intimate mediums, you just have to be yourself. And that to me is incredibly

01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:18.860
[Amit Varma]: fascinating, incredibly liberating. And I sort of thought of this also in a different

01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:24.300
[Amit Varma]: context where in your book, you speak about how one of the reasons Amitabh may have sort

01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:29.660
[Amit Varma]: of felt drawn to go into politics besides his close friendship with Rajiv and the sentimental

01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:34.900
[Amit Varma]: attachment and all of that was that when he had his accident in 1982, when he was so ill,

01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:40.060
[Amit Varma]: you point out how he was stunned by the amount of love and adoration that people have for

01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:44.540
[Amit Varma]: him. And it's and that's love and adoration at a distance where you're building temples

01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:49.220
[Amit Varma]: for someone. But there's something much more intimate about this new creator media, which

01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:53.980
[Amit Varma]: is something I've only started thinking about in the last couple of years, because by accident,

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:58.300
[Amit Varma]: I find myself in the, you know, in the thick of things. Is that something you've also thought

01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:02.460
[Amit Varma]: about as you know, you've spent decades almost doing the old school thing where you're one

01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:03.980
[Amit Varma]: person speaking to many?

01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:10.860
[Guest]: I actually thought about it a lot, because I'll give you an example. Whenever I did television,

01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:16.700
[Guest]: as an old axiom, you still find it in British television or in American television, that

01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:23.100
[Guest]: you speak to the camera as though you're speaking to a person. Yeah, and that whoever is watching

01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:28.860
[Guest]: you at the other end, will feel you're talking to them. That like, for instance, our conversation

01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:33.740
[Guest]: could have been a non tape recorded conversation, it would have been the same. We are making

01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:39.900
[Guest]: no concessions the fact that this is a broadcast. Now, telecasting, I was always taught, always

01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:44.860
[Guest]: learned was that like, if you interviewed somebody, you interviewed him like it was

01:56:44.860 --> 01:56:49.580
[Guest]: a conversation. There should be no artifice to it. It should be like you were chatting

01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:54.860
[Guest]: normally. One of the things that's happened in Indian television is that anchors have

01:56:54.860 --> 01:57:02.860
[Guest]: purposely abandoned intimacy. If you go on to one of the more popular English news channels

01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:08.540
[Guest]: today, there is no sense in which the anchor is talking to the camera as a viewer. One

01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:14.540
[Guest]: indication is the number of times they will say, ladies and gentlemen, viewer in the manner

01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:20.460
[Guest]: of a ringmaster at a circus, that you never ever do that in television. Classically, you

01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:27.500
[Guest]: still don't do it in television abroad. So oddly enough, mainstream media has become

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:34.620
[Guest]: much more circus like, much more dramatic and much more theatrical, at least mainstream

01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:39.580
[Guest]: television, which I think is not only a mistake from the point of view of quality, though

01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:45.180
[Guest]: it may well work from the point of view of popularity. Because mainstream media has now

01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:51.980
[Guest]: become so theatrical, has become so much like tamasha and drama, people actually crave

01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:57.900
[Guest]: something that's much more intimate, that talks to them as though they're real people.

01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:01.900
[Guest]: I'll give you an example. For much of my television career, I've been an interviewer.

01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:06.940
[Guest]: And one way to do an interview, and I'm sure there are other ways to do it, is as though

01:58:06.940 --> 01:58:11.900
[Guest]: you're talking to a person, and the viewer is a fly on the wall, somebody who's heard

01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:17.900
[Guest]: the conversation. You can't do that kind of interview now. Now you have to ask hostile

01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:24.460
[Guest]: questions, you have to shout a lot, you have to indicate to the viewer what a muscle macho

01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:31.100
[Guest]: man you are, etc. There is a much greater consciousness of the audience in mainstream

01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:38.060
[Guest]: television media now than there was earlier. In say, YouTube or whatever, if the audience

01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:44.140
[Guest]: is recognized, it's recognized by people who think, hey, you and I are both in on the joke,

01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:49.820
[Guest]: it's much more sly and it's annoying. There isn't this ringmaster approach. And though

01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:53.980
[Guest]: these people all say they're getting huge ratings, I think they're actually driving

01:58:53.980 --> 01:59:00.300
[Guest]: people away from this bandwaja, ringmaster style of presenting towards mediums that

01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:05.820
[Guest]: are towards media that are much more intimate, where people talk. Radio, for instance, now,

01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:12.540
[Guest]: as you said, with all these funny voices and these accents and this forced hilarity, and

01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:16.700
[Guest]: this sense of, hey, we're all having fun on this wonderful radio station. I think that

01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:20.620
[Guest]: actually started to put people off. They are much happier with somebody who treats them

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:21.340
[Amit Varma]: like adults.

01:59:22.380 --> 01:59:27.820
[Amit Varma]: And do you think some of this forced theatricality, so to say, comes from sort of falling into

01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:32.780
[Amit Varma]: a trap that let us say that you're in a, you join a TV news channel today, there is a conventional

01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:37.180
[Amit Varma]: way of doing things. And you don't want to get away from the convention. And there is

01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:41.580
[Amit Varma]: no discovery process where you can try out different things and figure out what works.

01:59:41.580 --> 01:59:45.740
[Amit Varma]: And interestingly, on YouTube, on podcasts, there is a natural discovery process, because

01:59:45.740 --> 01:59:50.060
[Amit Varma]: anybody, everybody's throwing everything at the wall, and something's taken, niches get

01:59:50.060 --> 01:59:54.620
[Amit Varma]: formed, and niches get discovered, which wouldn't otherwise even get discovered in the bigger

01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:58.940
[Amit Varma]: places. So, you know, is that a kind of trap that you see?

01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:04.060
[Guest]: Absolutely. You look at the younger people, people who've been for three years, four years

02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:09.420
[Guest]: in the business on many of these news channels. And they're also saying things halfway through

02:00:09.420 --> 02:00:13.900
[Guest]: talking to a guest, you know, do you think the people of India will stand for this?

02:00:13.900 --> 02:00:18.940
[Guest]: Our viewers know who's telling the truth. So they started out with this sort of band

02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:22.300
[Guest]: bhaja approach. And unfortunately, it will become normal for them.

02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:28.460
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and there's sometimes a lag of decades before change happens in any field. I often

02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:33.820
[Amit Varma]: talk about, you know, Ignaz Semmelweis, who the mid 19th century doctor who realized that

02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:37.820
[Amit Varma]: a lot of deaths in hospitals occurred because people didn't wash their hands. And he wasn't

02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:42.860
[Amit Varma]: taken seriously for decades. It took millions of deaths, potentially from that before people

02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:46.860
[Amit Varma]: kind of figured it out. And that, of course, had a real human consequence. So one could

02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:51.420
[Amit Varma]: argue the human consequence here is sort of unseen in a way. I also want to ask you about

02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:55.020
[Amit Varma]: the art of conversation. Because again, it's something that I think about a lot. I taught

02:00:55.020 --> 02:01:00.460
[Amit Varma]: a podcasting course at one point where I examined different styles of interviewing. And I found

02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:04.700
[Amit Varma]: something you said in your book resonated with me. And I agreed completely, where you were at one

02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:08.860
[Amit Varma]: point asked to do a program that was like hard talk. And you were like, No, I don't want to do

02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:13.740
[Amit Varma]: something adversarial, I want to have a conversation. And it strikes me that a lot of interviewing

02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:18.460
[Amit Varma]: that you see, like you just mentioned, is adversarial is looking for gotcha moments is

02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:23.180
[Amit Varma]: looking to put a person in a spot. Like one of the values that I've developed for myself is one,

02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:27.020
[Amit Varma]: of course, I don't like to do q&as, I like to do conversations. But the other value is I simply

02:01:27.020 --> 02:01:33.260
[Amit Varma]: never interrupt. Because what really gets my goat in interviews that I see online is that the host

02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:38.620
[Amit Varma]: is just interrupting all the time without taking any names. And this keeps the conversation at a

02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:43.420
[Amit Varma]: shallow level, the guests never really relaxes never gets a chance to go deep. The host is

02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:48.460
[Amit Varma]: always thinking about his or her next question rather than actually listening and, you know,

02:01:48.460 --> 02:01:53.820
[Amit Varma]: following those kind of rabbit holes. Now you have like, way, way, way more experience than I

02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:59.100
[Amit Varma]: have in constructing conversations and in thinking about it. So can you share some of your insights?

02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:04.860
[Guest]: Yes, my approach to an interview is probably different for many people in the business.

02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:12.220
[Guest]: Lots of people do detailed research before they go in. They are like cross examination lawyers,

02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:18.060
[Guest]: they know the answers to the questions before they ask. I do some research, so as not to seem

02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:24.700
[Guest]: like an idiot, but not much more than that. My perspective is that of a viewer who doesn't know

02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:29.740
[Guest]: very much about the guest. But I am slightly better informed than the viewer. That's it.

02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:34.620
[Guest]: Then the rest of it has to be curiosity. Because you assume the viewer has the same level of

02:02:34.620 --> 02:02:40.940
[Guest]: curiosity, you put the man at ease, you let him tell a story. And periodically, as you've done

02:02:40.940 --> 02:02:46.780
[Guest]: with me, you make him question his assumptions and say, but do you think that really makes sense?

02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:51.420
[Guest]: And if the interviewee is honest, he will probably say, you're right, I've thought about this again,

02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:55.580
[Guest]: as I have with you in the course of this conversation. I think that is how you get

02:02:55.580 --> 02:03:00.940
[Guest]: the most out of the person. There's also a danger, particularly with celebrity interviewers,

02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:05.420
[Guest]: that you make the mistake of believing that people watch the show for you. They don't,

02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:10.300
[Guest]: they watch the show for your guests. So what you've got to do is get the best out of your guests,

02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:15.660
[Guest]: make them feel you really understand the guest, you know what the guest is like. I think all of

02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:20.380
[Guest]: that is now forgotten. You have that same, I'm going to get you, I'm going to trap you kind of

02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:25.740
[Guest]: moment. And yet, if you sit down, can you tell me in the last 10 years, anybody of consequence who's

02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:30.620
[Guest]: ever been trapped in a television interview on Indian TV? It never works. They never managed

02:03:30.620 --> 02:03:36.540
[Guest]: to trap anyone. They just wreck the interview. And often it is this, I want to show the audience

02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:43.100
[Guest]: what a macho guy or lady I am. I gave it, I don't care. If you do that, which is, I mean, okay,

02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:47.980
[Guest]: if you think the whole thing is a narcissistic exercise, but as an interview, it's a disaster.

02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:52.860
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I agree with all of that, except I'll add a little nuance to one point, which is that

02:03:52.860 --> 02:03:56.860
[Amit Varma]: all the podcasters I follow, I actually, all the interview podcasts, for example, whether it's

02:03:56.860 --> 02:04:01.740
[Amit Varma]: Econ Talk by Russ Roberts or Conversations with Tyler by Tyler Carvin, or Sam Harris's great

02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:05.820
[Amit Varma]: interview podcast, I don't follow it because of the guests. I take it for granted that they'll

02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:10.460
[Amit Varma]: get an interesting guest. I follow them because I'm following their intellectual journeys and

02:04:10.460 --> 02:04:15.660
[Amit Varma]: their curiosities. And of course, those are rich and enriching because they are respectful of the

02:04:15.660 --> 02:04:20.700
[Amit Varma]: guest and they are not looking for gotcha moments. And they're basically adhering to the principles

02:04:20.700 --> 02:04:25.340
[Amit Varma]: that we both kind of spoke about. So to that extent, I think that the personal does become

02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:29.820
[Amit Varma]: very important, which kind of brings me to my next question, which is something that I have

02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:34.540
[Amit Varma]: kind of wondered and thought about and struggled with at different parts of my past, which is,

02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:39.500
[Amit Varma]: what do you do for personal satisfaction? And what do you do? Because it seems like a sensible

02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:44.620
[Amit Varma]: thing to do within your career, and it will make you money. So you know, like in your book, when

02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:49.740
[Amit Varma]: I follow your journey, I see you doing a lot of shows. And obviously, at one point, it's lucrative

02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:54.380
[Amit Varma]: and you're doing all of these shows. But what are those things you've done, which you were really

02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:59.420
[Amit Varma]: passionate about? You know, you really, that you look back and you say that even if I hadn't got

02:04:59.420 --> 02:05:06.460
[Guest]: paid, I would have done this. Well, I do a lot of writing, for instance, writing I do for ht.com.

02:05:06.460 --> 02:05:11.820
[Guest]: The column is very popular. I don't get paid very much for it. I do it because I want to have a

02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:17.420
[Guest]: voice. I enjoy having a voice. So much of my writing, if you write books, there's very little

02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:23.740
[Guest]: money in books, for instance, but there is a sense of satisfaction. So television on the whole is for

02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:29.580
[Guest]: the money, let's be brutal about this. But almost all of the writing is done for love of writing

02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:36.140
[Amit Varma]: and saying something rather than making money. So here's my next question about a journalist,

02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:41.740
[Amit Varma]: like one of the things that comes out again in your book is that you've got great access. And

02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:47.100
[Amit Varma]: a lot of the journalism that one does is built on building access, having people talk to you,

02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:52.700
[Amit Varma]: because that's how you get great stories and all of that. How does this access change how you look

02:05:52.700 --> 02:05:58.780
[Amit Varma]: at these people? Like, you know, a lot of these people, you speak about what a warm, lovely person,

02:05:58.780 --> 02:06:02.460
[Amit Varma]: someone like Bal Thackeray is. So on the one hand, you relate to him in a personal way.

02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:07.260
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, you relate in a different way to his politics. And there seems to be a kind

02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:12.700
[Amit Varma]: of dissonance there. So how does it affect your writing? How does it affect your perspectives?

02:06:12.700 --> 02:06:17.820
[Amit Varma]: At some point, do you feel that, you know, this is all just a grand play that is playing out and

02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:23.260
[Guest]: you're playing a part in it as well? Well, two or three things. First of all, I think India has

02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:31.580
[Guest]: changed. In the era when I had access, I was far from the only person who had access. Journalists

02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:38.060
[Guest]: were more respected by the political class. People came and spoke to us. They discussed

02:06:38.060 --> 02:06:44.140
[Guest]: things with us. When we had objections to what they were doing, they took us seriously. Nowadays,

02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:49.180
[Guest]: you're either a poodle or you're garbage. I mean, nobody really has any respect in the political

02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:55.420
[Guest]: class, has any respect for journalists or for our views. When they have to engage with journalists,

02:06:55.420 --> 02:07:00.220
[Guest]: very rarely with anybody of consequence come. Instead, they send these sort of moronic

02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:05.900
[Guest]: spokespeople onto television to take part in more moronic debates and fight. The real actors

02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:10.460
[Guest]: hardly ever come onto television. Once upon a time, they would. I mean, I got Narasimhano,

02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:15.820
[Guest]: Gujarat, various people to come to the studio and talk about it. So, there is a difference in the

02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:23.740
[Guest]: way people respond to us. Secondly, the price you pay for access usually is that you're supposed to

02:07:23.740 --> 02:07:31.180
[Guest]: be kind to the person who has given you this access. That's always true to an extent, but it's

02:07:31.180 --> 02:07:35.900
[Guest]: less true than you would think. For instance, I had a great deal of access to Bal Thackeray,

02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:41.660
[Guest]: who you mentioned. Yet, almost everything I wrote was against the Shiv Sena. I don't think there's

02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:46.460
[Guest]: one initiative they took that I supported. You gave me the example of my saying that

02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:51.820
[Guest]: Narasimha Rao was a small-time manipulator. Yet, Narasimha Rao did not deny me access.

02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:57.740
[Guest]: I continued to meet him. So, yes, there will always be politicians who will say that since

02:07:57.740 --> 02:08:02.780
[Guest]: you've written bad things about me, I don't think I should waste time with you. But most mature

02:08:02.780 --> 02:08:09.260
[Guest]: politicians in that era, even if you were hostile to them or whatever, would call you over partly

02:08:09.260 --> 02:08:13.660
[Guest]: because they respected you, but mostly because they thought by giving you access and explaining

02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:20.220
[Guest]: things, they could change your mind. But in answer to your larger question, all access journalism is

02:08:20.220 --> 02:08:26.380
[Guest]: dangerous because there is often an unspoken trade-off, which is in return for the access to

02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:31.740
[Guest]: get favorable coverage. So, you have to make it quite clear in the beginning that while you're

02:08:31.740 --> 02:08:35.740
[Guest]: quite willing to put across their position sympathetically, you are not willing to put

02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:42.300
[Guest]: across the right position or say that you agree with it. So, my next question is a slightly

02:08:42.300 --> 02:08:48.060
[Amit Varma]: complicated and rambly one. One, you've written in your book about how so many politicians are,

02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:51.900
[Amit Varma]: I mean, all people are creatures of circumstance, but so many politicians as well. You gave the

02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:55.900
[Amit Varma]: examples of Naveen Patnaik and Jyotiraditya Sindhiya as people who were on a completely

02:08:55.900 --> 02:09:01.740
[Amit Varma]: different track, but because of circumstances, kind of came into politics and surprised everyone

02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:08.140
[Amit Varma]: with the personas they adopted and perhaps even the persons they became. Now, it gets me to

02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:12.300
[Amit Varma]: thinking about, you know, somebody had raised the question of why are Indian politicians today

02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:17.580
[Amit Varma]: so apparently venal when our freedom fighters or our founding group of politicians are independent,

02:09:17.580 --> 02:09:21.820
[Amit Varma]: so to say, were such noble people. And my point there was that the incentives were different,

02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:25.500
[Amit Varma]: that when those people were fighting for freedom like the Nehru's and the Gandhi's and the Patel's

02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:29.580
[Amit Varma]: and all that, there was no power to be had. So, it wasn't lust for power which drove them.

02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:34.300
[Amit Varma]: It was a higher set of ideals and therefore, that's the kind of people that they were. Even

02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:39.020
[Amit Varma]: if they made mistakes as politicians or mistakes in governing and all of that, they were honest

02:09:39.020 --> 02:09:43.020
[Amit Varma]: mistakes made in good faith. They were driven by the right ideals. The incentives have changed

02:09:43.020 --> 02:09:47.980
[Amit Varma]: completely today because the state is so incredibly all-powerful and power corrupts,

02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:52.860
[Amit Varma]: as the cliche goes. And perhaps this is simplistic, that politics always corrodes character

02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:58.380
[Amit Varma]: because you might enter politics having a certain set of principles. But then to get ahead in

02:09:58.380 --> 02:10:03.580
[Amit Varma]: politics, you have to adopt a persona. So, the question is, does the persona then become a

02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:09.980
[Amit Varma]: person? And the secondary question is that, is there a particular type of politician, a type of

02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:15.260
[Amit Varma]: person, almost a sociopath as it were, who is therefore likely to thrive? Like, I'd done a

02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:18.860
[Amit Varma]: column on this as well a few years back, where studies had found that sociopaths, and sociopathy

02:10:18.860 --> 02:10:23.180
[Amit Varma]: by the way for my listeners is, you know, not an empty pejorative. It's a particular condition of

02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:26.860
[Amit Varma]: the brain where a particular part of the brain, I think the amygdala is damaged in a particular way,

02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:32.860
[Amit Varma]: so you don't feel empathy for others. And sociopaths are over-represented in, I think it

02:10:32.860 --> 02:10:39.580
[Amit Varma]: was bankers, prison convicts, and politicians. And my point was that sociopaths are more likely

02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:44.140
[Amit Varma]: to be drawn to politics because they have the characteristics it takes to get ahead. And in

02:10:44.140 --> 02:10:48.700
[Amit Varma]: this context, I was struck by something that you said about VP Singh and I'll just quote from that

02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:53.500
[Amit Varma]: lovely chapter where you write, quote, the problem with VP Singh was that he was a little like Arvind

02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:58.620
[Amit Varma]: Kejriwal is today. Financially upright, soft-spoken, competent, and capable of evoking strong emotions

02:10:58.620 --> 02:11:03.660
[Amit Varma]: among his supporters. But he was also a man without any core beliefs, without any long-term

02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:08.860
[Amit Varma]: loyalty, except one or two political friends, and without any transparency. Even Advani, who was

02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:13.500
[Amit Varma]: vilified by the secular media, was a relatively straight person. If he said he was going to do

02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:18.380
[Amit Varma]: something, he usually did it. VP Singh, on the other hand, was capable of such duplicity that

02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:22.540
[Amit Varma]: if you asked him what day of the week it was, and he said, Tuesday, the chances were that it was

02:11:22.540 --> 02:11:27.180
[Amit Varma]: really Friday, stop quote. And I love this because Kejriwal is exactly like this as well. So that's

02:11:27.180 --> 02:11:32.940
[Amit Varma]: a beautiful comparison that is drawn. Now, in the simplistic view that I put forward to you,

02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:37.660
[Amit Varma]: it would seem that every politician will inevitably be like this. But your book is

02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:42.940
[Amit Varma]: full of slightly richer and more complex characters. So what is your sense one of,

02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:49.740
[Amit Varma]: is there a type of person who thrives in politics? And two, how do politicians in your experience

02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:54.860
[Amit Varma]: wrestle with these kind of dual imperatives, this conflict between the persona and person as it were?

02:11:56.620 --> 02:12:01.100
[Guest]: Gosh, it's a difficult question. I think there are many different kinds of people

02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:07.020
[Guest]: who join politics, and they do it for different reasons. We talked about the freedom fighter

02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:11.500
[Guest]: generation. They didn't join politics because they thought there was any chance of them ever

02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:15.900
[Guest]: getting anything out of it. They joined because they had a mission to free India.

02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:21.820
[Guest]: The generation after this believed in a term we laugh at these days, which is nation building.

02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:26.620
[Guest]: They believed that they were part of building this great democratic experiment that the rest

02:12:26.620 --> 02:12:32.700
[Guest]: of the world said couldn't work. I think in subsequent generations, it gets more and more

02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:39.420
[Guest]: difficult. And it depends on which party you're part of. Look at the RSS and the Jamsung.

02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:45.100
[Guest]: There was a time before Vajpayee when nobody thought the Jamsung would ever come to office

02:12:45.100 --> 02:12:51.660
[Guest]: or would ever come to power. In 1996, Vajpayee became prime minister for 13 days, had to resign

02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:57.980
[Guest]: because nobody would touch the BJP and they regarded them untouchable. So what kind of person

02:12:57.980 --> 02:13:05.020
[Guest]: joins the BJP or joins the RSS in that situation? It's clearly not a man who wants to get rich

02:13:05.020 --> 02:13:09.820
[Guest]: or a man who necessarily wants to be powerful because the chances are that he'll never get near

02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:17.260
[Guest]: power. So the answer in my experience is the man who joins in these circumstances is a man who's

02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:23.660
[Guest]: ideologically motivated, who disagrees usually with the kind of India that the freedom fighters

02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:30.060
[Guest]: and the founding fathers created, who wants to transform India to be more a mirror image of

02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:37.740
[Guest]: what Golwalkar or somebody wanted. In many ways, this kind of man is more dangerous. So certainly

02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:43.340
[Guest]: worth watching more closely because he believes that the end, which is the transformation of

02:13:43.340 --> 02:13:48.780
[Guest]: India, is much more important than the democratic means, which kept them from getting power for 40

02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:56.620
[Guest]: years or 50 years. Therefore, he will do whatever is necessary, whatever is required to achieve

02:13:56.620 --> 02:14:03.020
[Guest]: that aim and then you're possibly right, it may help to be a sociopath. But that kind of person

02:14:03.020 --> 02:14:08.380
[Guest]: therefore doesn't care about norms, doesn't care about other people and just does it. So that's

02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:14.140
[Guest]: one kind of person. The second kind of person is the kind of politician you see today. Many of them

02:14:14.140 --> 02:14:20.140
[Guest]: are dynasts. These are people who joined politics not because they had any love of politics or any

02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:26.780
[Guest]: commitment to people, but because it was the family business. For them, politics is no more than a

02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:32.380
[Guest]: business opportunity. People always think it's extraordinary that so many people who joined

02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:39.180
[Guest]: the Congress and swore loyalty to secularism are now in the BJP saying absolutely opposite.

02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:45.180
[Guest]: But for these people, politics is not really about ideology. It's not really about belief.

02:14:45.180 --> 02:14:50.460
[Guest]: It's only about self-advancement, like a businessman who's done very well in the steel

02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:55.100
[Guest]: industry, but now sees an opportunity in the computer industry. So he leaves the steel industry

02:14:55.100 --> 02:15:01.420
[Guest]: behind and goes off to join the computer industry. That's what they're like. And therefore, in many

02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:07.180
[Guest]: ways, you have to take everything they say with a pinch of salt, because they're saying it only

02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:11.420
[Guest]: because they believe that's the requirement of the industry they're in. When the industry changes,

02:15:11.420 --> 02:15:15.580
[Guest]: their rhetoric changes. So there are different kinds of people who join politics.

02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:19.900
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's fascinating. I'm reminded of Keynes who said, you know, when the facts change,

02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:24.380
[Amit Varma]: I change my mind, sir, what do you do? A politician might well say that when my incentives change,

02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:28.780
[Amit Varma]: I change my party, sir, what do you do? Absolutely. Shashi Tharoor did a column in

02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:35.740
[Guest]: which he said that people who joined a career, say, I'll give you my own example. So you join

02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:41.340
[Guest]: HDFC bank, and you realize your better career prospects, a stand chart, you change jobs.

02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:45.580
[Guest]: Politics has become a bit like that people just look at career prospects,

02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:49.100
[Guest]: there is no sense of ideology of having ever believed in anything.

02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:55.100
[Amit Varma]: So that's interesting, because then what that also makes it more likely that the true believers,

02:15:55.100 --> 02:15:58.540
[Amit Varma]: as it were, are people who are within the BJP, because they joined the BJP, when

02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:02.300
[Amit Varma]: so you know, that could either be a feature or a bug, depending on how you look at it.

02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:07.740
[Amit Varma]: My next question goes to a conversation that you report having with Advani about the Babri

02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:11.340
[Amit Varma]: Masjid, where in your book, you report at one time, you asked him that, how do you know this

02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:16.940
[Amit Varma]: is a birthplace of Ram? How do you know Ram even existed? And so on and so forth. And his answer

02:16:16.940 --> 02:16:21.580
[Amit Varma]: is that it doesn't matter what the facts are, it matters what people believe, you know, that faith

02:16:21.580 --> 02:16:26.300
[Amit Varma]: is important. And this brings that whole dichotomy of faith versus facts. And this is a larger

02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:30.620
[Amit Varma]: dichotomy in today's times. And this is in a sense, is a question to you about both politics

02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:34.700
[Amit Varma]: and media, like you must have read Walter Lippmann's classic book on journalism, Public

02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:38.620
[Amit Varma]: Opinion, where the first chapter is titled the world outside in the picture in our heads,

02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:42.780
[Amit Varma]: where he points out that most people have a construction of the world in their heads,

02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:46.540
[Amit Varma]: that cannot correspond exactly to the world, obviously, because the world is so complex, but

02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:50.140
[Amit Varma]: which is kind of made up. Now back in the day, when you had a consensus and truth,

02:16:50.140 --> 02:16:52.860
[Amit Varma]: you had a mainstream media, everybody got information from the same place,

02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:58.460
[Amit Varma]: that picture was very similar. Now the picture can be anything that anybody wants it to be.

02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:03.980
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you know, what Murali Manohar Joshi was doing, inventing history's whole scale,

02:17:03.980 --> 02:17:09.420
[Amit Varma]: when he was in the HRD ministry, is not something that is so unusual. It is something that

02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:13.820
[Amit Varma]: would be successful, perhaps was successful, will be successful. And just taking that thought

02:17:13.820 --> 02:17:18.940
[Amit Varma]: forward, it also strikes me that this is something that the ruling dispensation realizes,

02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:24.060
[Amit Varma]: that what matters is constructing narrative. Governance doesn't really matter so much,

02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:28.940
[Amit Varma]: one because Indian people have just become so apathetic and resigned to bad governance,

02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:34.380
[Amit Varma]: but also because you can always build a narrative about anything. And these are really two different

02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:39.020
[Amit Varma]: skill sets. One is a skill set of winning elections by pushing narratives. And the other

02:17:39.020 --> 02:17:44.060
[Amit Varma]: is a skill set of governing wealth. And they seem to me to be two totally different skill sets,

02:17:44.060 --> 02:17:47.980
[Amit Varma]: which have nothing to do with each other. So a party that excels at the one, you shouldn't

02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:54.060
[Amit Varma]: expect them necessarily to excel at the other or be outraged when they don't. But in a larger sense,

02:17:54.060 --> 02:17:59.340
[Amit Varma]: how does this make you feel? Because all your life as a journalist, as a newscaster,

02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:03.420
[Amit Varma]: it's in a sense, I mean, I know I'm stating it a bit idealistically, but it's in the pursuit of

02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:08.220
[Amit Varma]: truth. It's at least in the recognition that there is a truth. While in modern times,

02:18:08.220 --> 02:18:10.700
[Amit Varma]: there are just different narratives. How do you feel about this?

02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:14.940
[Guest]: Well, I think in many ways, Advani with his, it doesn't matter what the truth is,

02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:19.260
[Guest]: it's what people believe the truth is, was ahead of his time, because you watch

02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:25.580
[Guest]: Kelly and Conway and all these other Republicans on television now, alternative facts, which is

02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:31.420
[Guest]: what Advani was presenting us without knowing the term. But I'll give you three examples from

02:18:31.420 --> 02:18:36.620
[Guest]: social media and the government over the last three days. One is the government got up in

02:18:36.620 --> 02:18:42.540
[Guest]: parliament and said, there have been no oxygen deaths in India during the pandemic. Two, it

02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:49.180
[Guest]: got up and said, there has been no shortage of vaccines. And three, throughout social media,

02:18:49.180 --> 02:18:54.620
[Guest]: the glove puppets of the ruling establishment picked up a story about amnesty and what it

02:18:54.620 --> 02:19:01.820
[Guest]: said about the Pegasus revelations, twisted its meaning and ran it throughout social media saying

02:19:01.820 --> 02:19:07.260
[Guest]: that amnesty has denied the truth of the Pegasus report, has said we never said these Pegasus

02:19:07.260 --> 02:19:14.300
[Guest]: phones were hacked. Now, all three are utter and complete lies. All three got wide circulation,

02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:17.660
[Guest]: at least in the case of the first two, because they came from people you don't normally expect

02:19:17.660 --> 02:19:24.380
[Guest]: to lie, ministers in the government of India. But as you say, the sad reality is that they have

02:19:24.380 --> 02:19:30.060
[Guest]: built a narrative over what if you were kind, you could call alternative facts, but if you were

02:19:30.060 --> 02:19:36.940
[Guest]: brutal, you would call lies. And that ultimately is how governance functions today. You don't let

02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:42.860
[Guest]: the truth ever get you down. You invent your narrative, you stick with your narrative,

02:19:42.860 --> 02:19:49.500
[Guest]: you manipulate social media to promote that narrative, and you browbeat traditional media

02:19:49.500 --> 02:19:54.620
[Guest]: to also carry that narrative. If they don't carry that narrative, they will say you're being unfair

02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:58.220
[Guest]: to us. Why aren't you carrying our side of the story? And you say, but your side of the story

02:19:58.220 --> 02:20:03.020
[Guest]: is a lie. So what? You have to be fair to us. That's what we've been reduced to.

02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:08.380
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'm reminded of that story of if a journalist is in a room and one person tells

02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:12.380
[Amit Varma]: him it's raining and the other person says it's not raining, his job is not to report both. His

02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:15.980
[Amit Varma]: job is to go to the window and look outside. Yeah. And I don't know if you've read this book

02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:20.860
[Amit Varma]: by Harry Frankfurt called On Bullshit. No, I haven't. Yeah. So Harry Frankfurt is a philosopher.

02:20:20.860 --> 02:20:27.180
[Amit Varma]: I think he wrote this essay in the mid 80s and it came out as a book in the early 2000s. And he

02:20:27.180 --> 02:20:32.220
[Amit Varma]: uses this phrase bullshit in a particular way. He says that many politicians aren't lying.

02:20:32.220 --> 02:20:37.820
[Amit Varma]: They are bullshitting. And the difference is that a lie acknowledges that there is a truth

02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:43.660
[Amit Varma]: and that, you know, it is not the truth. But when it comes to bullshitting, people don't care about

02:20:43.660 --> 02:20:47.180
[Amit Varma]: the truth. It doesn't matter. They'll just say whatever. It may be true sometimes accidentally.

02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:50.620
[Amit Varma]: It may not be true sometimes. It doesn't matter. They're just bullshitting, going with the

02:20:50.620 --> 02:20:55.740
[Amit Varma]: narrative. I think Trump did this a hell of a lot. I see a lot of this coming from this

02:20:55.740 --> 02:21:00.220
[Amit Varma]: dispensation. In fact, these seem to me to be examples of just bullshitting that there was no

02:21:00.220 --> 02:21:05.340
[Guest]: oxygen shortage. The government minister saying there was no vaccine shortage is more than

02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:09.740
[Guest]: bullshitting. It's a lie. It's a lie. It's an answer to a specific question to tell a lie

02:21:09.740 --> 02:21:16.140
[Guest]: that is easily demonstrably disprovable that everybody knows that there was a vaccine shortage.

02:21:16.140 --> 02:21:20.780
[Guest]: Everybody can get the figures. But the guy says it because he can. He can get away in

02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:24.460
[Amit Varma]: today's environment to telling a lie. No, I won't argue this particular example.

02:21:24.460 --> 02:21:27.340
[Amit Varma]: But Frankfurt's distinction was. No, I think it's a good distinction.

02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:31.180
[Guest]: I think it's a good distinction. We ultimately nowadays do politics by bullshit.

02:21:31.180 --> 02:21:34.940
[Guest]: These guys just make it up all along and never let the facts get in the way.

02:21:35.660 --> 02:21:40.620
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly. And we see a lot of this in social media as well. So let's kind of talk about

02:21:40.620 --> 02:21:46.700
[Amit Varma]: social media because I see two sort of disconcerting trends in social media apart from

02:21:46.700 --> 02:21:53.180
[Amit Varma]: the polarization of the discourse and all of that. I see two sort of ways in which social media can

02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:59.980
[Amit Varma]: turn a user into a different person. And one is and this is again, perhaps from the vocal minority

02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:04.860
[Amit Varma]: and the silent majority is not like this. But from a lot of people, you see a rudeness which

02:22:04.860 --> 02:22:09.580
[Amit Varma]: you would not otherwise see in traditional media, a classic form of that being the quote tweet.

02:22:09.580 --> 02:22:13.260
[Amit Varma]: Like if you and I were having a disagreement and I said something you thought was stupid,

02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:16.780
[Amit Varma]: you would not immediately in my presence turn to a third person and say, oh, look,

02:22:16.780 --> 02:22:21.180
[Amit Varma]: Amit is such a fool. Amit is an idiot, you know, but this happens all the time on Twitter.

02:22:21.180 --> 02:22:26.060
[Amit Varma]: And it's almost become a reflexive thing that you're passing judgment on others to show your

02:22:26.060 --> 02:22:30.700
[Amit Varma]: own virtue. Because every time you diss someone, you're basically saying something about yourself

02:22:30.700 --> 02:22:35.420
[Amit Varma]: as well. You're saying I am better than this. I am at a higher moral ground or whatever

02:22:35.420 --> 02:22:40.540
[Amit Varma]: intellectual ground to pass judgment on this person. And this, it seems to me can have a

02:22:40.540 --> 02:22:46.380
[Amit Varma]: corrosive aspect on a person's character, even in the real world. And the other aspect is that

02:22:46.380 --> 02:22:51.820
[Amit Varma]: people adopt certainty much sooner. Like, you know, if social media had been around when I was

02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:56.300
[Amit Varma]: in my teens or early 20s, it would have been a disaster because one does so many stupid things,

02:22:56.300 --> 02:23:00.620
[Amit Varma]: one says so many stupid things. But as you go through life, you learn, you become a better

02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:05.100
[Amit Varma]: person, you change your views. I think social media often what happens is if you're 19,

02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:09.740
[Amit Varma]: you know, you find your echo chamber online, you get comfort from being part of an ideological

02:23:09.740 --> 02:23:14.060
[Amit Varma]: tribe, you put out tweets, you say whatever. And after that, you're jostling for position within

02:23:14.060 --> 02:23:20.700
[Amit Varma]: that tribe by expressing your purity. I think then having taken hardened stance, you then find

02:23:20.700 --> 02:23:25.500
[Amit Varma]: yourself doubling down, which is a human tendency. And you become more and more hardened, which

02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:31.820
[Amit Varma]: otherwise you might not have, if not for these imperatives of posturing and seeking validation

02:23:31.820 --> 02:23:36.300
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. Is this stuff that you've thought about? I mean, I know you've been at the receiving

02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:41.580
[Amit Varma]: end of trolling and rudeness and all of that as well yourself. And at the same time, you know,

02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:47.020
[Amit Varma]: you have a following of your own, you use social media, a fair bit, I see you on Twitter. So,

02:23:47.660 --> 02:23:52.700
[Guest]: what are your thoughts on this? I think some of it is the tyranny

02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:58.860
[Guest]: or the advantage of distance. I'll give you a simple example. If you watch any television show,

02:23:59.580 --> 02:24:07.100
[Guest]: people are very rude to each other. Most shows degenerate into fights or abuse or whatever.

02:24:07.100 --> 02:24:12.300
[Guest]: Now, if you were to take the guests on that same show, and you were to put them in a television

02:24:12.300 --> 02:24:19.340
[Guest]: studio, they're always much more civilized. Here they're in windows, they're talking alone

02:24:19.340 --> 02:24:24.700
[Guest]: into a camera or into a computer, they don't actually see the other person. So, they feel

02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:30.780
[Guest]: they can get away with treating that person with less respect, being much ruder, being much more

02:24:30.780 --> 02:24:36.220
[Guest]: offensive than they would be. You take that forward into social media, where not only do

02:24:36.220 --> 02:24:40.780
[Guest]: you have the disadvantage, if I'm talking to you, I'm obliged to be polite, I mean, it's human

02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:46.620
[Guest]: nature. If I'm tweeting to you from a great distance, I can say what I like. So, I think

02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:52.300
[Guest]: that if the impersonal nature of communication always leads to an increase in rudeness,

02:24:52.860 --> 02:24:58.780
[Guest]: then there are all the factors you talk about, which is that the great thing about social media

02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:05.180
[Guest]: is that it provides a level playing field. Somebody like say the Prime Minister can tweet

02:25:05.180 --> 02:25:09.500
[Guest]: something, and you can tweet a response to him. You may have millions of followers, you may have

02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:15.900
[Guest]: 5,000, but at least when the tweets appear, they appear side by side. So, there is that illusion,

02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:22.380
[Guest]: that sense of equality that you too can have your say. Now, that's incredibly empowering in some

02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:30.860
[Guest]: ways. But also, I think it allows people to be more abusive than they otherwise would be. Many

02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:35.740
[Guest]: of the people say who abuse Rahul Gandhi. If they were next to Rahul Gandhi, they would not do this,

02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:41.500
[Guest]: but they feel powerful. They feel you can say to him, you're a papu, you count for nothing, etc.

02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:48.700
[Guest]: So, social media strengthens, gives a sort of Dutch courage to people who want to be negative,

02:25:48.700 --> 02:25:53.900
[Guest]: allows them to do something. Also, and you made that point about social media mobs,

02:25:53.900 --> 02:25:59.340
[Guest]: that if you're in it from an early age, you fall in with one lot, and then you double down

02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:05.420
[Guest]: on your things. Often, social media makes you feel more powerful than you are as an individual,

02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:10.540
[Guest]: because you feel you're part of something greater. Say, you're part of a Congress mob

02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:15.660
[Guest]: that attacks anybody who says anything bad about Rahul Gandhi, or you're part of a Sanghi mob that

02:26:15.660 --> 02:26:22.460
[Guest]: does it. And then add to that the control rooms, the glove puppets, the two rupee walas, who are

02:26:22.460 --> 02:26:28.460
[Guest]: sent in there basically to lower the tone of discourse, to make it abusive, to make it rude.

02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:33.420
[Guest]: Once the debate takes on that tenor, when you join, you tend to follow that tenor.

02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:36.380
[Guest]: So, I think it's a combination of many, many factors.

02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:42.940
[Amit Varma]: It reminds me of this experiment that was carried out in the US, where basically people exiting a

02:26:42.940 --> 02:26:48.540
[Amit Varma]: sports arena were sent into a tent or whatever, and there's a puppet there of a sports star who

02:26:48.540 --> 02:26:53.420
[Amit Varma]: was at that time unpopular with the franchise, and they could say whatever they wanted, went as it

02:26:53.420 --> 02:26:57.820
[Amit Varma]: were. And the whole deal was that this person would go in and he would shout and scream or

02:26:57.820 --> 02:27:02.220
[Amit Varma]: abuse or say whatever. And then from behind the puppet, the actual sports star would emerge.

02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:08.700
[Amit Varma]: So, I'll actually look, I don't think there are video clips of it. I'll look for them,

02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:13.260
[Amit Varma]: because it's just fascinating. And it's a fascinating experiment of sort of how that

02:27:13.260 --> 02:27:18.540
[Amit Varma]: kind of works. You know, your book is, I love reading it so much. And I won't ask you more

02:27:18.540 --> 02:27:22.700
[Amit Varma]: questions on the politics and the media aspects of it. I suggest everyone should just go out and

02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:28.780
[Amit Varma]: read that. But I'll end with some general questions. And one of those is kind of an observation as well,

02:27:28.780 --> 02:27:33.420
[Amit Varma]: really, that I wanted to make because one of the things that I was delighted by when I started

02:27:33.420 --> 02:27:39.980
[Amit Varma]: reading this book was how lol funny it was to use millennial lingo, which honestly, I have to say,

02:27:39.980 --> 02:27:43.980
[Amit Varma]: I've been reading it for many, many years, I did not expect it to be this funny, like there were

02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:47.980
[Guest]: chapter titles, which just made me laugh out loud, like, you know, chapter titles are my

02:27:47.980 --> 02:27:53.180
[Guest]: wife's work, I can't take the credit for them. She edited the book, and she wrote all the chapter titles.

02:27:53.180 --> 02:27:56.940
[Amit Varma]: Well, they're fantastic, but they come from your chapters, which you did, right? So you know,

02:27:56.940 --> 02:28:02.460
[Amit Varma]: little things like Pondith here, but I cannot, which is your colleague in the Calcutta office

02:28:02.460 --> 02:28:08.460
[Amit Varma]: calling up the BBC. And but the funniest part, which I just I burst out laughing and alarmed

02:28:08.460 --> 02:28:15.660
[Amit Varma]: the people around me was Atlas Bihar vampire, where HD in Bhopal carried a headline, which was

02:28:15.660 --> 02:28:20.860
[Amit Varma]: Atlas Bihar vampire comes to Bhopal. And you investigated further and found out that it was

02:28:20.860 --> 02:28:26.700
[Amit Varma]: somebody using a spellchecker and they had meant Atal Bihari Vajpayee comes to Bhopal, but it became

02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:33.260
[Amit Varma]: Atlas Bihar vampire, which is just hilarious. Well, for that, for the man in question,

02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:37.980
[Guest]: it happened on a day when I was entering the Hindustan Times and Shobhana Bharatia,

02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:43.180
[Guest]: who is the owner is the owner of the Hindustan Times, were both in town. And we both woke up

02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:47.500
[Guest]: in the morning, read this and went ballistic. If he had done it on some other day, you'd have got

02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:54.540
[Amit Varma]: away with it. It's just hilarious. Yeah, I mean, Bhopal readers would have been like,

02:28:55.420 --> 02:29:01.100
[Amit Varma]: what the fuck? So that is something I really enjoyed. My next question is this, that what

02:29:01.100 --> 02:29:06.620
[Amit Varma]: drives you now? You know, you've been in journalism for so many decades, you're still doing new things,

02:29:06.620 --> 02:29:11.180
[Amit Varma]: you're experimenting with new things, a lot of your thoughts about the intimacy of the medium,

02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:17.660
[Amit Varma]: about the nature of how people consume media have changed, are extremely spot on from where I'm

02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:23.180
[Amit Varma]: sitting. So what drives you like, you know, what are the things that we can expect from you over

02:29:23.180 --> 02:29:28.780
[Amit Varma]: the next 10 years? And in general, like you've, you've shared, you know, brief snippets of what

02:29:28.780 --> 02:29:33.740
[Amit Varma]: your philosophy towards life is like, you know, taking happiness in the small things, and so on

02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:37.980
[Amit Varma]: and so forth. But what is it that really keeps you going keeps you excited at a personal level?

02:29:37.980 --> 02:29:42.860
[Guest]: I don't know, you know, it's a very difficult question to answer, though, you use the word

02:29:42.860 --> 02:29:49.660
[Guest]: serendipity for a lot of my career. So much of life has just happened to me, there's never been

02:29:49.660 --> 02:29:55.580
[Guest]: a grand design, never a desire to do something. I've done things that haven't worked out, because

02:29:55.580 --> 02:30:00.700
[Guest]: they seem the right thing to do at the time. I joined NewsX, because I edited a newspaper,

02:30:00.700 --> 02:30:05.340
[Guest]: so it seemed right to now try and run a television channel when that was a fiasco.

02:30:05.340 --> 02:30:10.380
[Guest]: So whenever I've tried to do something that seems like the right thing to do,

02:30:10.380 --> 02:30:17.260
[Guest]: it has almost never worked out. So I've just let life pass me by. I have in the last few years,

02:30:17.820 --> 02:30:22.700
[Guest]: taken much more interest in food, which I think is a growing area. Apart from Easy Diner,

02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:27.260
[Guest]: I'm also chairman of a company called Culinary Culture, which is going to rate restaurants

02:30:27.260 --> 02:30:32.540
[Guest]: and courage chefs that had really got going. And then the pandemic happened with a bit of

02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:37.340
[Guest]: luck that'll end and we'll go on with that. That takes up a fair amount of my time.

02:30:37.340 --> 02:30:43.740
[Guest]: I like doing political writing, I do it. I've been less keen on television over the last year or so.

02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:51.180
[Guest]: I mean, I do it because the only kind of, I have no interest in anchoring debates. So the only kind

02:30:51.180 --> 02:30:57.180
[Guest]: of television I could do would be an interview show, which I am happy to do. But during the

02:30:57.180 --> 02:31:01.980
[Guest]: pandemic, this was impossible because you couldn't meet people face to face. And there's the other

02:31:01.980 --> 02:31:07.260
[Guest]: problem which we will have to reconcile ourselves to, which is that nobody in a position of great

02:31:07.260 --> 02:31:12.780
[Guest]: authority in the government will give me an interview. The way it now works is that if you're

02:31:12.780 --> 02:31:17.180
[Guest]: Rajnath Singh or somebody with an independent stature of your own or Gadkari, you decide who

02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:23.260
[Guest]: you give interviews to. But almost everybody else has to refer all interview requests to the Prime

02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:28.300
[Guest]: Minister's office. And I don't think the Prime Minister is too high in mind to get more, but the

02:31:28.300 --> 02:31:34.300
[Guest]: people lower down take the line that if the person is not one of us, then he shouldn't be given any

02:31:34.300 --> 02:31:40.540
[Guest]: access. So you end up therefore doing interview shows with opposition members, with people who

02:31:40.540 --> 02:31:45.740
[Guest]: are not in politics. I mean, I did it for a while, but it's frustrating. And it got even more

02:31:45.740 --> 02:31:50.300
[Guest]: frustrating because I did say an interview with Jan Sinha when he was Civil Aviation Minister,

02:31:50.300 --> 02:31:54.940
[Guest]: he was very good. I had an interview with Alphonse when he was Tourism Minister and he spoke well.

02:31:54.940 --> 02:31:59.100
[Guest]: They were the two ministers who were dropped immediately when things went on. So the people

02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:02.460
[Guest]: who are willing to talk to you, the people who are willing to express their point of view,

02:32:02.460 --> 02:32:07.660
[Guest]: are the people who are out of sync anyway, and probably won't last. If I wanted, say,

02:32:07.660 --> 02:32:13.260
[Guest]: to interview Nirmala Sitharaman, for instance, there's no chance I would ever get that interview.

02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:17.100
[Guest]: If I went to Amit Shah's house to ask for an interview, I'd probably be shot on sight. No,

02:32:17.100 --> 02:32:22.380
[Guest]: I'm exaggerating, but I would certainly be frog-marshed out of the building. So there is no

02:32:22.380 --> 02:32:27.180
[Guest]: way you can get access into this government. And it's frustrating for an interviewer if you're

02:32:27.180 --> 02:32:32.700
[Guest]: doing interviews with people who matter, if the people who run this country close themselves to

02:32:32.700 --> 02:32:38.220
[Guest]: you. The Prime Minister has not given a single interview, as far as I know, apart from a few

02:32:38.220 --> 02:32:43.260
[Guest]: things to a few selected media people on areas where the questions have been pre-arranged or

02:32:43.260 --> 02:32:48.540
[Guest]: whatever. He's not attended a single press conference. So there is no tradition in this

02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:54.780
[Guest]: government of openness, of being willing to answer questions. So that is the problem with doing an

02:32:54.780 --> 02:32:59.740
[Guest]: interview show. If I can find a way of getting around that, then I'd love to do an interview

02:32:59.740 --> 02:33:04.300
[Guest]: show. And I have spoken to channels who are interested in doing that. I love writing,

02:33:04.300 --> 02:33:09.260
[Guest]: so I continue to write, though it doesn't necessarily make me much money, but I think

02:33:09.260 --> 02:33:16.220
[Guest]: keeps me alive. There's also a sense that when you're 65, which I am now, you've had your say,

02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:21.660
[Guest]: you've had your turn. There are newer people coming up who want to be on television, who want

02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:28.620
[Guest]: to run newspapers, etc. And there's nothing more irritating or annoying than an old guy who's had

02:33:28.620 --> 02:33:35.100
[Guest]: his say but keeps hanging on because he can't find anything else to do. So I've tried very hard and

02:33:35.100 --> 02:33:40.380
[Guest]: as gracefully as possible to move out of the way. And now it's not just the next generation,

02:33:40.380 --> 02:33:46.460
[Guest]: several generations below me have come of age for them to appear. So on the whole, I want to now do,

02:33:46.460 --> 02:33:51.900
[Guest]: I mean, I've worked fairly hard most of my life. I want to do the things I enjoy,

02:33:51.900 --> 02:33:57.020
[Guest]: and with a bit of luck, do enough to keep body and soul together and make enough money to survive.

02:33:58.140 --> 02:34:01.500
[Amit Varma]: So a digressive question, because you just mentioned food, and I realized that I have

02:34:01.500 --> 02:34:06.220
[Amit Varma]: to ask you at least one question about food writing. Otherwise, what is the show even?

02:34:06.220 --> 02:34:09.740
[Amit Varma]: And this is something I've explored with other sort of food writers who've come on my show earlier,

02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:15.180
[Amit Varma]: like Shubhana Rayan and Nandita Iyer and so on, which is that when you write about food,

02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:18.940
[Amit Varma]: initially, one might think that, oh, I like movies, let me write a film review or oh,

02:34:18.940 --> 02:34:24.220
[Amit Varma]: I like food, let me write a restaurant review. And one may start like that. But when it becomes

02:34:24.220 --> 02:34:29.820
[Amit Varma]: a vocation, when you continue doing it, and you go deeper and deeper, one does your appreciation

02:34:29.820 --> 02:34:35.020
[Amit Varma]: of the food increase that much? Like, are you that much more mindful about everything that

02:34:35.020 --> 02:34:39.740
[Amit Varma]: you're eating and you're thinking about it in different ways that you otherwise would not have?

02:34:39.740 --> 02:34:45.340
[Amit Varma]: And is there then a larger lesson in it, perhaps for journalists, that the best way to increase

02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:49.260
[Amit Varma]: your mindfulness about something or your appreciation of something or your knowledge

02:34:49.260 --> 02:34:55.340
[Guest]: of something is to force yourself to write about it? I think that's true. I think I don't I mean,

02:34:55.340 --> 02:34:59.180
[Guest]: I like food and I've learned much more. I've been doing this column now, I think next year will be

02:34:59.180 --> 02:35:05.340
[Guest]: 20 years. So I've been in this column for a very long time. And obviously, I know much more about

02:35:05.340 --> 02:35:12.460
[Guest]: food when I started than I did when I started out writing this column. And as time goes on,

02:35:12.460 --> 02:35:17.660
[Guest]: you learn more and you realize the things you've written earlier were wrong, which is always a very

02:35:17.660 --> 02:35:24.060
[Guest]: humbling experience. But frankly, I've now lost interest in writing about restaurants or writing

02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:29.820
[Guest]: about food that's good. I'm more fascinated by the other aspects of food. My column this week,

02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:36.300
[Guest]: for instance, is on biryani. Now, biryani is a huge, huge craze in India, despite many efforts

02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:40.620
[Guest]: on the part of the powers that be to indicate that khichdi is a more appropriate subject for

02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:47.260
[Guest]: us to learn. But still, India loves biryani, no matter how you vote. Now, because biryani

02:35:47.260 --> 02:35:52.140
[Guest]: has become such a craze, there's a lot of misinformation. There's this argument, which

02:35:52.140 --> 02:35:58.060
[Guest]: I believed for a long time, that biryani, which I didn't believe, the argument that biryani came

02:35:58.060 --> 02:36:03.580
[Guest]: from Iran, which is nonsense, it was invented in India. We think it was invented around the

02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:09.500
[Guest]: time of Shah Jahan, or perhaps Jahangir. But because something was invented at the time of

02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:14.540
[Guest]: Jahangir, doesn't mean that Jahangir necessarily ate it. Just because we are having this conversation

02:36:14.540 --> 02:36:18.140
[Guest]: at the time of Narendra Modi, that doesn't necessarily mean he's watching. So…

02:36:18.140 --> 02:36:23.180
[Guest]: So he is watching, though we know that now. Yeah, that's one good thing in India,

02:36:23.180 --> 02:36:29.580
[Guest]: you're never alone, they're always watching. But more seriously, I mean, just because something

02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:35.740
[Guest]: was created during a period, doesn't mean it's necessarily regal or royal. And the whole mythology

02:36:35.740 --> 02:36:41.340
[Guest]: has been built up around biryani, saying it was a court dish and all of that. In fact, the more

02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:47.340
[Guest]: I've researched, my research shows me things I'd never guessed about and how I was wrong before.

02:36:47.340 --> 02:36:53.660
[Guest]: All the evidence is that the emperors ate yakhni pulao, which is a dish that came from Iran,

02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:59.260
[Guest]: and is a more delicate dish, more difficult to do. Biryani was made in these large vessels

02:36:59.260 --> 02:37:05.580
[Guest]: to feed everybody else. So it was a dish for the masses. It was never really a royal dish,

02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:11.740
[Guest]: despite the mythology we have now. So doing that story, talking to historians, talking to people

02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:17.580
[Guest]: who read the original text, trying to figure out from somebody, for instance, in Lucknow, the biryani,

02:37:17.580 --> 02:37:23.420
[Guest]: what we call biryani, the chefs insist on calling a pulao. So in what sense is the Lucknow biryani

02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:29.580
[Guest]: a pulao? What sense is it not? I actually enjoy doing stuff like that, which goes beyond saying

02:37:29.580 --> 02:37:35.820
[Guest]: a Lucknow biryani is the best or whatever. And I think the only way you can still enjoy writing a

02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:41.180
[Guest]: column like that is if you change the focus from simple, I love, it's great and take a pumpkin,

02:37:41.180 --> 02:37:46.220
[Guest]: slice it into four, and that's a great way of making it. If you look at the other aspects of food.

02:37:47.180 --> 02:37:51.980
[Amit Varma]: Illuminating. And this reminds me of a poem by Vijay Sheshadri, where he talks about, quote,

02:37:51.980 --> 02:37:55.900
[Amit Varma]: unquote, the mountain at the end of the universe. And the philosophical question there is that

02:37:55.900 --> 02:38:00.140
[Amit Varma]: if the whole universe ends, and there is just a mountain remaining, is it really a mountain?

02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:04.540
[Amit Varma]: What is it really? Like, what is it a mountain in comparison to, for example? And the same thing

02:38:04.540 --> 02:38:08.860
[Amit Varma]: could be said about a dish of rice at the end of the universe. Is it a biryani or a pulao?

02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:11.260
[Guest]: Or is it just a dish of rice?

02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:17.660
[Amit Varma]: Is it just a dish of rice? And what is rice even? So my penultimate question to you,

02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:22.620
[Amit Varma]: and it's a two part question, I guess, that you've just written this great book where you've looked

02:38:22.620 --> 02:38:26.620
[Amit Varma]: back, not just on your own life, but also on Indian politics, Indian media, all of that. It's

02:38:26.620 --> 02:38:32.220
[Amit Varma]: a very rich book. If I ask you to look forward now, and let's say, look forward to maybe 10

02:38:32.220 --> 02:38:36.540
[Amit Varma]: years from now, what gives you hope and what gives you despair about the sort of direction

02:38:36.540 --> 02:38:39.820
[Amit Varma]: we are moving in and about the possibilities that lie ahead of us?

02:38:39.820 --> 02:38:45.660
[Guest]: I believe, for better or for worse, that the Prime Minister's greatest achievement

02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:52.060
[Guest]: is that he's done what people considered impossible. He's weaponized Hinduism. It's

02:38:52.060 --> 02:38:57.260
[Guest]: easy enough to weaponize a minority and to make them feel they're discriminated against and they

02:38:57.260 --> 02:39:03.500
[Guest]: have to vote. It's almost impossible, I would have thought, to take what, 85% of the population

02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:07.420
[Guest]: and make them feel that they're being discriminated against and attacked by the

02:39:07.420 --> 02:39:13.740
[Guest]: other 40% or 15%. But he's pulled it off. There are Hindus who feel that they're,

02:39:13.740 --> 02:39:18.700
[Guest]: what's the term, second class citizens in their own country, that they're under constant attacks

02:39:18.700 --> 02:39:24.700
[Guest]: from jihadis, that the jihadis are coming and taking their women away from them with love jihad.

02:39:24.700 --> 02:39:30.780
[Guest]: And this whole mythology has been built up. Now, you and I may laugh about this mythology,

02:39:30.780 --> 02:39:37.820
[Guest]: but what it does is that people now vote for the BJP and for this government, not because of what

02:39:37.820 --> 02:39:44.220
[Guest]: it does, but because of what it is, which means that till now, the Prime Minister has been

02:39:44.220 --> 02:39:49.900
[Guest]: moralist, performance-proof. Even if demonetization happens and it's a complete disaster,

02:39:49.900 --> 02:39:55.500
[Guest]: he's okay. In the first wave, the lockdowns were a complete disaster, but research by some

02:39:55.500 --> 02:40:01.420
[Guest]: psychologists has shown in Bihar that even the migrants who were displaced went and voted for

02:40:01.420 --> 02:40:08.300
[Guest]: the BJP. So, so far, it hasn't mattered so much. I don't know if the COVID deaths and the terrible

02:40:08.300 --> 02:40:13.900
[Guest]: mishandling of the second wave will make a difference, but you can only carry on what

02:40:13.900 --> 02:40:19.660
[Guest]: is ultimately done where we're all pious about Mayawati and Mulayam. What the BJP is now doing

02:40:19.660 --> 02:40:26.700
[Guest]: is the ultimate in identity politics. But experience has shown us that identity politics cannot last

02:40:26.700 --> 02:40:33.260
[Guest]: forever. So while there is an absence at the moment of a clear alternative, I think things

02:40:33.260 --> 02:40:39.020
[Guest]: could change in the next two years or three years. Certainly, maybe not enough to defeat the BJP,

02:40:39.020 --> 02:40:44.860
[Guest]: but enough to weaken it. If it weakens it enough, it has to form a coalition. Then Mr. Modi is not

02:40:44.860 --> 02:40:51.500
[Guest]: quite the titan he seems at the moment. So if you work on that assumption, then the India that he

02:40:51.500 --> 02:40:58.380
[Guest]: has created may not survive for that long. You may have an India with a more vibrant politics

02:40:58.380 --> 02:41:05.740
[Guest]: rather than a unipolar politics that revolves only around the BJP. And you may have other regimes and

02:41:05.740 --> 02:41:11.020
[Guest]: other politicians who are willing to talk to the media, who are willing to give more access,

02:41:11.020 --> 02:41:18.300
[Guest]: that another spirit of give and take is introduced between the media and the rest of the country.

02:41:18.300 --> 02:41:23.660
[Guest]: If that does happen, if politicians are willing to talk to us, then I think we are going to be

02:41:23.660 --> 02:41:29.900
[Guest]: in the next five, six years into a different India. There's also another factor that all of

02:41:29.900 --> 02:41:35.340
[Guest]: this Muslim bashing is based on the assumption that Muslims will sit there and take it.

02:41:35.340 --> 02:41:40.860
[Guest]: And so far that assumption has been right, nothing's happened. But will that happen indefinitely?

02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:45.820
[Guest]: Will people just continue to have their children abused at school, continue to be made to feel

02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:50.220
[Guest]: that they're traitors to their own country, the country that families are given their lives for?

02:41:50.860 --> 02:41:55.100
[Guest]: I don't think they will. So if this kind of divisive politics continues,

02:41:55.100 --> 02:42:01.420
[Guest]: then I think we're in for quite a lot of trouble in India on the communal front. And ironically,

02:42:01.420 --> 02:42:06.540
[Guest]: all of this is self-fulfilling. If, say, young Muslims who feel discriminated against or

02:42:07.660 --> 02:42:13.660
[Guest]: unemployable resort to any kind of violence, this is taken to the Hindu majority and said,

02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:18.860
[Guest]: here, we told you these guys were jihadis, now here is proof. So I think that unless things

02:42:18.860 --> 02:42:25.420
[Guest]: change, we are in a very dangerous phase when it comes to the fragile communal balance in India.

02:42:25.420 --> 02:42:31.340
[Guest]: So that is something that concerns me about the next 10 years. I'm also very concerned

02:42:31.340 --> 02:42:36.700
[Guest]: about the economy. I mean, one of the things we were proud of in the Manmohan Singh era

02:42:36.700 --> 02:42:42.860
[Guest]: was that India-Pakistan hyphenation had ended. It was now India-China. Nobody bothers to even

02:42:42.860 --> 02:42:48.540
[Guest]: talk about us in the same breath as China. We are back to being India-Pakistan, at least largely

02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:54.140
[Guest]: because the political establishment has not only screwed up the economy, it has been obsessive

02:42:54.140 --> 02:42:59.500
[Guest]: in its emphasis on Pakistan. We used to say once upon a time that India is top of the mind for

02:42:59.500 --> 02:43:04.860
[Guest]: every Pakistani, but for Indians, who even thinks about it, we hardly even think about it. Not true

02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:10.060
[Guest]: any longer. Politicians think about it every day. I think that's also a very dangerous phase.

02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:17.180
[Guest]: If the economy does not deliver, there are many, many people joining the job market. They will not

02:43:17.180 --> 02:43:24.300
[Guest]: get jobs. There will be a huge amount of unrest and a huge amount of frustration. So what are

02:43:24.300 --> 02:43:30.380
[Guest]: the solutions required? I think, one, you need some kind of more tolerant, more inclusive regime.

02:43:30.380 --> 02:43:35.660
[Guest]: That may not be possible with the current cast of characters, but perhaps those circumstances

02:43:35.660 --> 02:43:41.420
[Guest]: will change. You also need somebody who understands the economy, knows how to manage it.

02:43:41.420 --> 02:43:45.580
[Guest]: I mean, the distinguishing factor of this government's economic management has been

02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:50.940
[Guest]: mediocrity. Nobody says that they're geniuses, they're going to do things. I hope that changes

02:43:50.940 --> 02:43:56.940
[Guest]: very quickly because we've gone in seven years from being the country the world looks at and

02:43:56.940 --> 02:44:01.900
[Guest]: wonders what will happen to being the country the world worries about. There's a huge uproar in India

02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:06.300
[Guest]: at the moment because the economists just called India the sick man of Asia, which is the kind of

02:44:06.300 --> 02:44:12.140
[Guest]: thing they used to say about India in the 60s. But I think we risk going back to those days,

02:44:12.140 --> 02:44:16.780
[Guest]: and that worries me greatly. So there is some reason for hope, but there are many,

02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:22.620
[Amit Varma]: many reasons for concern. Yeah, wise words. And you know, that old cliche,

02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:26.380
[Amit Varma]: I think Harold Wilson, it was said that, you know, a week is a long time in politics.

02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:30.220
[Amit Varma]: So it's actually unfair to ask anyone a question about what politics could look like 10 years from

02:44:30.220 --> 02:44:34.860
[Amit Varma]: now, because things change so fast. I mean, just looking at America, and I'm thinking aloud in 2004

02:44:34.860 --> 02:44:38.860
[Amit Varma]: when Bush beat Kerry, who would have thought that your next president is going to be a guy

02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:44.300
[Amit Varma]: whose surname rhymes with Osama and whose middle name is Hussein? Or who would have thought when,

02:44:44.300 --> 02:44:47.740
[Amit Varma]: you know, Obama won for the second time, the next president is going to be Donald Trump.

02:44:48.300 --> 02:44:53.100
[Guest]: So crazy things happen. So all political predictions are a high risk business.

02:44:54.140 --> 02:44:59.580
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly. So my final question, and this is, again, something that's particular to the show,

02:44:59.580 --> 02:45:03.580
[Amit Varma]: because people like to read so much, and they're always looking for book recommendations,

02:45:03.580 --> 02:45:09.500
[Amit Varma]: without any bar on subject or genre or whatever. You know, if there are four or five books or

02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:12.860
[Amit Varma]: whatever number is easy to come up with you on the spur of the moment, which you want to share

02:45:12.860 --> 02:45:17.100
[Amit Varma]: with the world, you feel that, hey, these are books everyone should read. Or if there are books

02:45:17.100 --> 02:45:21.580
[Amit Varma]: that you feel shaped you and change the way you look at the world, you know, give us some

02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:29.660
[Guest]: recommendations. Christ, it's difficult. I'm trying to think. Well, fiction, I've quoted from it. So

02:45:29.660 --> 02:45:34.060
[Guest]: I'll quote from it again. I think in many ways, it's the perfect novel. I think everyone should

02:45:34.060 --> 02:45:39.500
[Guest]: read The Great Catchment. Because it's ostensibly a simple story, but there's so many little pearls

02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:45.500
[Guest]: of wisdom, like the lines I quoted earlier in the show. I think everyone should read that.

02:45:46.780 --> 02:45:53.420
[Guest]: Thinking. I think anyone who lives in Mumbai should read Sacred Games. I think it's still

02:45:53.420 --> 02:45:58.940
[Guest]: the definitive Mumbai novel. I wouldn't be too worried about the television adaptation,

02:45:58.940 --> 02:46:02.780
[Guest]: the first one was good, the second one was rubbish. But just read the book. I think the

02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:08.060
[Guest]: book is worth reading. If you're interested in the media, which I think many of us are,

02:46:08.060 --> 02:46:13.020
[Guest]: particularly the history of the media, to understand how we got here, read The Powers

02:46:13.020 --> 02:46:19.980
[Guest]: That Be by David Halberstam. That came out in the 1980s. But it tells you how CBS became what it is,

02:46:19.980 --> 02:46:26.300
[Guest]: how Time magazine became what it is. It talks, The Washington Post, it talks about great media

02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:33.900
[Guest]: organizations and what it takes to found them or to become them. Books about India are pretty much

02:46:33.900 --> 02:46:38.940
[Guest]: anything by Ram Goa. I don't think I've ever read anything Ram has written and not felt

02:46:38.940 --> 02:46:48.220
[Guest]: enriched at the end of time. And both of Nandan Nirakani's books, I think they're both interesting.

02:46:48.220 --> 02:46:54.860
[Guest]: The first one is even better than the second, but both of them deal with stuff at the level of ideas,

02:46:54.860 --> 02:47:01.980
[Guest]: which I think is unusual in India. And it sustains your interest. And I think Shashi Tharoor's book

02:47:01.980 --> 02:47:06.700
[Guest]: on Empire. I can't remember what it was called, what the British did to us in India,

02:47:06.700 --> 02:47:11.340
[Guest]: was Inglourious Empire, something like that. Please read that. I think it's very important

02:47:11.340 --> 02:47:17.660
[Guest]: for every Indian to know what the British actually did for us and what we should be upset about.

02:47:17.660 --> 02:47:24.460
[Guest]: And yet, as we all know, we gained also, but we gained at enormous cost. Big enough list?

02:47:24.460 --> 02:47:28.300
[Amit Varma]: That's a big enough list to start with. Maybe some other time if you're on the show,

02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:33.900
[Amit Varma]: you can come better prepared with more books. I'll think of it. This was a curveball.

02:47:33.900 --> 02:47:36.940
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. Veer, thank you so much for coming on the show, for sharing your insights,

02:47:36.940 --> 02:47:40.700
[Amit Varma]: for giving me your time and for writing this wonderful book, which made me laugh so much

02:47:40.700 --> 02:47:42.620
[Guest]: and which also taught me so much. Thank you so much.

02:47:42.620 --> 02:48:06.140
[Amit Varma]: Thank you. It has been a real pleasure and a real joy. Thank you for inviting me.

02:48:12.620 --> 02:48:26.140
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.
