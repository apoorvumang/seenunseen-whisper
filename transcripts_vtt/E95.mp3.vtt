[Amit Varma]: V. M.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.960
[Amit Varma]: Vikram Doctor is an editor at the Economic Times, and I often describe him as the best

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.000
[Amit Varma]: food writer I have ever read. That's because when Vikram writes about food, he's also writing

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.660
[Amit Varma]: about culture, geopolitics and history at the same time, with equal love and passion

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.600
[Amit Varma]: shining through for all of them. Through his columns, I've learned both about how a lot

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.680
[Amit Varma]: of Indian food originated outside India, and is yet, at the same time, now deeply Indian.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.320
[Amit Varma]: I had a fascinating conversation with him on this subject, but before we cut to that,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.120
[Amit Varma]: here's a quick commercial break.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.520
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.440
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls? Well, worry no more. Head on over to IndianColors.com.

[Amit Varma]: like tote bags. This allows art lovers to actually get fine art into their homes at

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.840
[Amit Varma]: an accessible price, and artists get royalties on sales, just like authors do. What's more,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.920
[Guest]: scene in the NC. Thank you for having me. It's really great to be back in this podcasting

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.960
[Amit Varma]: space after almost two years, at which point I will urge my listeners to head on over to

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.000
[Amit Varma]: audiomatic.in and listen to the Real Food Podcast by Vikram Doctor. How many episodes

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.920
[Guest]: of that did you do? I think we managed about 48 or so. Wow. So you're beat us. I mean,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.040
[Amit Varma]: you're how many episodes already? Mine is, this will be episode 95. Mine is much easier.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.920
[Amit Varma]: You just sit down and you record a conversation. Yours included tons of research and was meticulously

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.160
[Guest]: produced and so on. We had a lot of people interviews from outside etc, which added to

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.480
[Amit Varma]: the interest but also made it much harder to do. So what I'd like to do for all of my

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.480
[Amit Varma]: listeners who may not know who you are, the few of them, as it might be, is kind of talk

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.400
[Amit Varma]: about how you got into writing about food in particular. You're obviously a very accomplished

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.440
[Amit Varma]: journalist. You work as a consulting editor at the Economic Times. But what I've always

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.280
[Amit Varma]: known you for is for being an incredible food writer. I often tell my friends and I don't

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.400
[Amit Varma]: want to embarrass you by saying this, but I often tell people you're the best food writer

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.720
[Amit Varma]: in the world because the kind of depth of insights you have not just about food, but

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.400
[Amit Varma]: the connections you make with food, to politics, to geography, to culture, to everything just

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.880
[Amit Varma]: blows my mind. How did you get interested in food? Well, I mean, when I started off

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.200
[Guest]: as a journalist, like a lot of young journalists, you know, all young journalists are made to

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.480
[Guest]: do a few routine things, you're always meant to do a few film reviews, you're meant to

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.840
[Guest]: do a few book reviews, and you're meant to do a few restaurant reviews. So I started

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.760
[Guest]: off doing restaurant reviews for I think it was Business India at that time. And, you

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.520
[Guest]: know, very quickly, I got very bored of doing restaurant reviews, because I don't know

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.480
[Guest]: if you agree with me, but I find the restaurant scene in Bombay is pretty sad. And for a basic

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.560
[Guest]: economic reason, I mean, the rents in Bombay are so high, the overheads for restaurants

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.720
[Guest]: are so high, that it pretty much kills off any interesting restaurant, you know, all

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.600
[Guest]: restaurants to make money have to become a sort of mean level food that they produce

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.800
[Guest]: really interesting niche restaurants. It's happening now, to some extent, but like 20

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.960
[Guest]: years back, it was pretty rare. And this is early 90s. Yeah, it was mid 90s. And, you

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.880
[Guest]: know, around that time, I mean, and I quickly ran through all the interesting niche restaurants

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.720
[Guest]: in Bombay. And I got really bored. And also beyond the point, I started appreciating what

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.720
[Guest]: goes into producing restaurants, and the amount of effort that people, you know, put into

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.280
[Guest]: running restaurants is crazy. And I started feeling guilty beyond the point of just coming

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.840
[Guest]: and having one meal and writing some stupid review about that. I mean, I'm not saying

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.360
[Guest]: all the restaurants were good. Many of them were completely crappy. But even a crappy

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.720
[Guest]: restaurant, unfortunately, requires a lot of work. So I just got bored about writing

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.000
[Guest]: about restaurants. But I did discover something interesting that I could talk to anyone about

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.120
[Guest]: food. And you could strike up a conversation. It's very, very rare that you find someone

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.080
[Guest]: who is not interested with food. And also, what was interesting about food was that you

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.760
[Guest]: could talk to people who people don't normally talk to. So for instance, women, a lot of

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.840
[Guest]: older women, you know, people who work behind the scenes, everybody's interested in food,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.040
[Guest]: everybody has food stories. Everybody has food memories. It became a great way to learn

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.840
[Amit Varma]: about people and different aspects of India. And were you interested in food in a general

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.760
[Amit Varma]: way from before this? Because you know, the depth of knowledge that you show in your columns,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.000
[Amit Varma]: for example, when you go to the origins of different kinds of food, and you're practically

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.480
[Amit Varma]: going back hundreds of years and drawing all these intricate narratives? How do you gain

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.760
[Amit Varma]: that knowledge? I mean, part of it, of course, comes from talking to people, like you said,

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.840
[Guest]: part of it comes from talking to people, but also a lot of it comes from just reading material.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.160
[Guest]: I was always interested in history. And especially, you know, different sources of history,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.280
[Guest]: like personal memoirs, newspaper accounts, you know, these sources of history that often get

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.480
[Guest]: overlooked. And I found that there was a wealth of material in that, which people were just not

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.040
[Guest]: looking at. There were all sorts of unusual sources of information, you know, for instance,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.840
[Guest]: especially when it comes to food. One of the things people don't understand about the government,

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.880
[Guest]: especially, you know, the agricultural department, is that we have this vast network of agricultural

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.880
[Guest]: research institutes, almost any type of food of any type of agricultural issue, there's an

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.440
[Guest]: institute dedicated to that, who are doing all sorts of fascinating in depth research in these

00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:00.120
[Guest]: areas. And you can often write to the directors of these institutes. And you'll get fascinating

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.280
[Guest]: bits of information, you know, so I started, you know, one thing I'm particularly interested in is

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:10.280
[Guest]: bananas, partly because I'm from South India, and I've always liked bananas. And I started becoming

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.840
[Guest]: curious about the different types of bananas I would see on the street side, especially in South

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.000
[Guest]: India, and I didn't know the names, or they had, you know, different names. And I started trying to

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.600
[Guest]: identify these bananas. And I actually wrote to the director of the National Research Center for

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.600
[Guest]: bananas in Trichy, a very nice gentleman called Dr. Mustafa at that time and sending him pictures

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.240
[Guest]: of the bananas, and he would very sweetly like, identify them and tell me a bit more about them.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:38.280
[Guest]: And that's when I realized that the stories behind things are really fascinating. And it's all there,

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, just you just have to read about it. And I mean, just hearing about a National

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:48.920
[Amit Varma]: Research Center for bananas is kind of funny in itself. So you know, the way I've always sort of

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:54.280
[Amit Varma]: food is I kind of think of food and cuisines as a static kind of thing, that I know that, okay,

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.240
[Amit Varma]: this is Konkani cuisine, and this is Tamilian cuisine, and this is North Indian cuisine,

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:04.440
[Amit Varma]: and blah, blah, blah. And, and that's partly because I'm at this fixed point in time,

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.320
[Amit Varma]: and I'm looking at it from that vantage point. And the more you read, and especially you get a

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.120
[Amit Varma]: sense of this through reading your columns, that it's actually really dynamic. And a lot of what

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.640
[Amit Varma]: we think of as Indian food isn't really Indian at all. In fact, there's so much of an intermingling

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:25.720
[Amit Varma]: of cultures and traditions in this almost literal and metaphorical melting pot, so to say.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.920
[Guest]: Absolutely. And, you know, I mean, I think this is true of any country, but particularly India,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.760
[Guest]: because, you know, this was one country where so many different traditions, so many

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.720
[Guest]: trade routes would meet. I mean, you know, we were at one end of the Silk Road,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:45.320
[Guest]: there's so many spices came, not just from India, but from Southeast Asia through India. So, you

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.800
[Guest]: know, that gave us all the connections towards Southeast Asia. So then you had all the different

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:55.240
[Guest]: waves of colonists and, you know, other people coming into India, bringing their own food

00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:01.640
[Guest]: traditions, refugees, immigrants. There's always been this vast churn of people across India,

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:07.720
[Guest]: and each churn is accompanied by their own food traditions. So that's what's really fascinating.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.800
[Guest]: There's nothing, once you start reading Indian food traditions, you realize that nothing is

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:17.320
[Guest]: static, that some of the things that we think are most intrinsically Indian are actually not

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.120
[Guest]: that Indian in their origin, though we have made them Indian now. And I'll give you two

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.840
[Guest]: fascinating examples. You know, we're recording this in November, the, you know, the festive

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:32.040
[Guest]: Diwali has just got over. And we have seen like all the religious seasons, all the rituals have

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.880
[Guest]: been happening. And you know, we've all these rituals have been accompanied by marigolds. And

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.480
[Guest]: we think of marigolds as being one of the most intrinsically Indian flowers.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.520
[Guest]: This is Gandalful.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.480
[Guest]: Gandalful, yeah, which you can eat, by the way. So I'm not actually,

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.800
[Guest]: if you remember in Monsoon Wedding, there was that guy who was always eating the marigolds. So

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.920
[Guest]: I'm not drifting too far away from food. Now, what people don't understand is that the marigolds that

00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:00.840
[Guest]: we have today are actually not Indian in origin. They are Mexican marigolds. They're a type of

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:06.040
[Guest]: plant called tagetes, which actually there was an Indian marigold earlier, which some people still

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.880
[Guest]: grow. They're called calendulas. They both have the same bright orange color. But calendulas are

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:17.160
[Guest]: simpler flowers, whereas the Mexican marigolds are much more impressive looking flowers.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:23.240
[Guest]: And at some point, these Mexican marigolds came to India. And we quietly shifted to growing

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.960
[Guest]: marigolds, which have always been part of Indian tradition, but just growing these Mexican

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:33.000
[Guest]: marigolds. So to me, it's fascinating, this Indian, all these Indian festivals are happening

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.120
[Guest]: with Mexican marigolds.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.760
[Guest]: Right. And what about the other one?

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.680
[Guest]: The other one is actually saffron. I mean, and I don't want to get too political, but you know,

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.120
[Guest]: the way saffron is now used as an adjective for a particular type of politics. And we say saffron

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:52.760
[Guest]: this, saffron like, saffron activists. But saffron in itself is not Indian. Now, let me qualify that.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:59.560
[Guest]: What is deeply Indian, what is deeply Hindu is that orange color. That orange color has always

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.680
[Guest]: been an intrinsically important part of Hindu rituals. And that would have come from, you know,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.720
[Guest]: ochre in the earth or from turmeric in particular. Turmeric is deeply Indian. It's a deeply Indian

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:16.840
[Guest]: part of Indian rituals. But saffron is not. I mean, saffron is an interesting spice for a couple

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:22.680
[Guest]: of reasons. One is it's a spice from the temperate zones. We think of spices as coming from tropical

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.160
[Guest]: countries, but saffron actually comes from the crocus flower, which grows in temperate climates.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.040
[Guest]: So it's one of the rare spices which comes from the more northern latitudes, which means that

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:38.120
[Guest]: there's only one part of India which is suitable for it, which is actually Kashmir. So and the

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:46.120
[Guest]: saffron in Kashmir is only recorded from around about the 5th or 6th century AD. So saffron in

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:52.200
[Guest]: itself is not deeply Indian. What seems to have happened, and unfortunately, as with a lot of food

00:12:52.200 --> 00:13:00.040
[Guest]: stuff, a lot of it is just conjecture. We started using kesar as an indication for that orange color,

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:05.720
[Guest]: which was so deeply Indian, possibly because it was more expensive. It was a sort of aspirational,

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:12.200
[Guest]: you know, it was more aspirational than haldi. So now we use kesar as a synonym for a whole

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.800
[Guest]: type of Hinduism. But saffron is not Indian. So where did it come from? It probably came from

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.640
[Guest]: somewhere in the Middle East, from somewhere in Turkey or somewhere like that, which is an

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.880
[Guest]: area of a lot of biodiversity. What else came from there? Oh, so much. I mean, wheat, of course,

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:34.040
[Guest]: originally came from there, possibly a whole bunch of spices like coriander, cumin.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:41.080
[Guest]: Rotis are not Indian. Well, yeah, rotis are probably not Indian. And in fact, through large

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.640
[Guest]: parts of India, they have not been part of Indian culture for very long. I mean, especially if you

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:51.000
[Guest]: come from South India, where I grew up, wheat, bread, rotis was simply not part of the culture.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.600
[Guest]: I mean, there were a few communities that made wheat rotis. But it really, wheat started growing

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:03.480
[Guest]: in South India after the 60s for a very simple economic political reason. In the 60s, India was

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.920
[Guest]: suffering from really severe famines. And we approached the US for aid, which the US under

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.720
[Guest]: Lyndon Johnson gave us aid, but as always with Americans, it was aid on their terms, which means

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:19.160
[Guest]: they didn't give us money, they gave us grain, the vast amounts of wheat grown in the Midwestern

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:25.880
[Guest]: states. So we got wheat under the PL 480 program. But once it came to India, the government had to

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:31.400
[Guest]: make Indians eat it. And we weren't used to this. I mean, for one thing, it was a very different

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.720
[Guest]: type of wheat from the sort of wheat that was being eaten in North India. You have lots of

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.760
[Guest]: complaints from the era of people in North India who had to like suddenly start eating this hard

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.840
[Guest]: American wheat. And then it had to come to South India where there were no traditions at all.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:50.440
[Guest]: And through a process of, you know, commercial spreading through sheer necessity through

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.800
[Guest]: government promotion, South India slowly started eating wheat. And so now it's very common in South

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:00.920
[Guest]: India to have bread and rotis and malabar parathas and things like that. But it's something which is

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.280
[Amit Varma]: less than 50 years old. And that's quite mind blowing to me, because of malabar paratha or the

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.440
[Amit Varma]: Kerala paratha, you think, oh, this is obviously so Indian as part of that cuisine. And you're

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.760
[Guest]: pointing out that it's not even as old as Nehru. Absolutely. I mean, a Kerala in particular,

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.920
[Guest]: and I'm saying this, because I'm half a Malayali has always been in a state where we just seen a

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:22.120
[Guest]: real wide amount of change of new products being introduced. And some of them are actually very

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:27.080
[Guest]: precisely dated, for instance, tapioca kappa, which is now seen as such a Malayali thing,

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.720
[Guest]: you can go to Malayali restaurants and you have kappa biryani and kappa and fish curry.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:38.280
[Guest]: But kappa, tapioca was very consciously introduced by the king of Travancore sometime in the mid

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:45.800
[Guest]: 19th century, when he saw that he needed some sort of starch substitute to make up for the rice

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.120
[Guest]: deficiencies because of shortfalls in rice production. And he realized that tapioca was

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:56.280
[Guest]: a tropical plant that grew easily. And he very consciously introduced tapioca into Kerala.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.480
[Guest]: And now tapioca is seen as intrinsically part of Kerala culture.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.680
[Amit Varma]: And this was a king of Travancore. But before that, where did tapioca come from?

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.720
[Guest]: Tapioca, cassava comes from the new world from Brazil.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.520
[Amit Varma]: Right, from South America, from South America. So just to sort of go back to that earlier thing,

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.840
[Amit Varma]: which we digress from, which is a Middle East. So what else comes from the wheat you were saying

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:22.360
[Guest]: comes from there, as you said, saffron, a whole range of spices, a number of fruits, lemons,

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.280
[Guest]: things like that. The Middle East is one of the great centers of biodiversity.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.800
[Amit Varma]: And from there, not just ingredients, but we also had ways of cooking and

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.800
[Guest]: entire cuisines come from the Middle East.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.280
[Guest]: Yes, to some extent. I mean, you know, for instance, a lot of our traditions of frying

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.880
[Guest]: and deep frying do seem to have come from the Middle East. And there are a number of reasons

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.920
[Guest]: for this. I mean, while, you know, I don't want to generalize and saying that frying was not

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:50.040
[Guest]: there in India earlier. It's true that frying was not common, as far as we know,

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.680
[Guest]: from the earlier sources. And there's a very simple reason for that. It's the fuel sources.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.000
[Guest]: I mean, a lot of food and cooking is driven by what fuel is available at your disposal.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:05.800
[Guest]: And in India, we did not have many fuel sources. Coal was relatively unknown in India. In fact,

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.600
[Guest]: it was completely unknown until the British era, except in very small parts of the Northeast.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.920
[Guest]: There was wood, but then wood has always been a problem through large parts of India.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:20.040
[Guest]: Our basic fuel source was cow dung. And it's one reason, among many others, that, you know,

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.840
[Guest]: cows are given this very special status in India. And if you know anything about cow dung,

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.880
[Guest]: is it burns with a very slow flame, okay? You can't get a very high heat on cow dung.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.440
[Guest]: What it's ideal for is for boiling. So, we developed whole cuisines based essentially

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.400
[Guest]: around boiling foods and our pots also became pots that could go on cow dung fires.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.200
[Guest]: So, there is some truth in the point that people like Michael Pollan have made that,

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:51.080
[Guest]: you know, Indian cuisine is essentially in its origins about boiling. But once the Muslims come

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.960
[Guest]: in, and these traditions come in, you get much many more traditions of frying. In fact, in many

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:02.040
[Guest]: parts of India, frying is still seen as much more of a Muslim tradition. And a lot of the utensils,

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:07.000
[Guest]: for instance, copper, which is ideal for frying because it conducts heat fast, is again seen as a

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.200
[Guest]: utensil as a type of metal used in the Muslim tradition. And again, we get, you know, many

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.600
[Guest]: types of food. So, one of the most intrinsic foods to India, which we think is so Indian,

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:21.080
[Guest]: as samosas, I mean, you know, you remember, what was the line that Lalu Prasad used?

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.240
[Amit Varma]: Jab tak samosa mein rahega, aloo Bihar mein rahega.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.720
[Guest]: Now, what is fascinating about that is neither samosas or aloo are originally Indian. Okay,

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.640
[Guest]: potatoes come with the British, samosas come from probably the Turkish tradition,

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.960
[Guest]: where you have something called sambusak. And this idea of getting a wheat dough,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.760
[Guest]: which is kneaded with oil, so it becomes flaky. That's a very intrinsically part of Turkic culture.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.080
[Guest]: You see it throughout Central Asia, and down to Turkey, where you have sambusak.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:53.640
[Guest]: So, samosas and potatoes are, you know, something that have come to us from outside and this

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:58.440
[Amit Varma]: tradition of, of cooking of deep frying things. Fantastic. And you know, one of the points you

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.160
[Amit Varma]: made to me when we were talking just before we started the recording for the show is that a lot

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:09.240
[Amit Varma]: of Indian cooking has adapted itself by pragmatism. And therefore, a lot of foreign

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.240
[Amit Varma]: elements get easily adapted, because they just happen to be more suited. Can you elaborate?

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:19.160
[Guest]: Yeah, see, I mean, this is a point, I think, a very pragmatic point that I often emphasize that,

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.280
[Guest]: you know, when it comes to cooking, we often forget who is actually doing the cooking.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:29.800
[Guest]: And the truth of Indian cooking is that vast amounts of Indian cooking depends on the

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.960
[Guest]: unacknowledged labor of two types of people, servants and daughters-in-law,

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:39.640
[Guest]: who are treated as servants, essentially. And this labor, you know, this unacknowledged labor

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:45.240
[Guest]: is what really goes into creating food, Indian food, and it's their labor, which would do all

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.520
[Guest]: this really boring, messy, tedious stuff that went into a lot of traditional cooking.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:57.000
[Guest]: And nobody wants to do this sort of work. So, as you know, more people became empowered,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.080
[Guest]: as it became harder to force, you know, your daughters-in-law to work as like,

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.640
[Guest]: essentially slave labor, people stopped wanting to do this traditional food. So,

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.600
[Guest]: I'll give you one example. One type of food that is very essentially Indian, in fact,

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:17.080
[Guest]: is banana flowers. Okay. Mochar, as you know them in Bengal, and it was there right through

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:22.760
[Guest]: southern India, through Bengal. In fact, if you can go to books like the Supershastra,

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.080
[Guest]: which is from something I'm forgetting that actually dates, but from Karnataka, it's an amazing

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:31.560
[Guest]: book. It's a cookbook, which half the recipes are using banana flower in different ways. And,

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.320
[Guest]: you know, when you look at this at the recipes, they're fascinating recipes from historical

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.880
[Guest]: perspective. But I just keep thinking of all the people who had to clean the banana flowers.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.480
[Guest]: And if you've ever cleaned banana flowers, you will know it's a tedious job, because you have

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.240
[Guest]: to oil your hands, because there's a sort of sticky substance that's in the banana flowers.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.360
[Guest]: And then each petal, you know, each sort of proto banana has this sort of undigestible part,

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.920
[Guest]: which has to be cleaned off by hand. It's a real pain. You've cleaned it. I've tried doing it,

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.040
[Guest]: and it's a real pain. I mean, the results are delicious. I love mochar. I love the banana

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.920
[Guest]: flower recipes once they finally cook, but God knows it's not something I want to do every day.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:15.800
[Guest]: And so, at some point, when these English vegetables, as they're called foreign vegetables

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:21.480
[Guest]: started coming in from different sources, people stopped cooking banana flower. And they start

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.720
[Guest]: cook to these sort of Western vegetables, or not Western, just from outside India,

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:31.000
[Guest]: non-Indian vegetables, which were just much easier to cook. Cabbage, for instance, you know,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.320
[Guest]: I mean, you can cook red cabbage in particular, so that it tastes a lot like banana flower.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.560
[Guest]: And it's so much easier to cook. You just chop it up. I mean, cabbage is not Indian,

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:44.600
[Guest]: it's a very deeply European vegetable. But I often think Indians cook cabbage in really

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.920
[Guest]: wonderful ways. It's just that because we don't value cabbage, we don't value all the Indian

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:55.800
[Guest]: dishes that use cabbage. So, we started cooking all these vegetables. And these sort of traditional

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.920
[Guest]: Indian vegetables got largely forgotten. I mean, the interesting irony is that these

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:07.640
[Guest]: vegetables are now being rediscovered, not in India, but abroad, because the huge growth of

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:13.800
[Guest]: the vegan movement abroad is actually finding all these traditional Indian ingredients very useful,

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.200
[Guest]: because so much of Indian food is actually very easily adaptable to vegan food, especially from

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.680
[Guest]: South India, where you have coconut milk, instead of cow's milk or buffalo's milk,

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:28.440
[Guest]: then it's all essentially vegan food. So, you can go to New York, and you can have these really

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:34.200
[Guest]: fancy hipster restaurants, which will serve you burgers made out of banana flower, or green jack

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.080
[Guest]: fruit, another very intrinsically Indian vegetable. Whereas it's almost impossible to get these dishes

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.480
[Amit Varma]: in India now, for good reason. And you know, a few episodes back, I did an episode of the

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.880
[Amit Varma]: scene in the unseen called metrics of empowerment, where I sat down with three economists, Devika

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.200
[Amit Varma]: Kher, Nidhi Gupta, and Hamsini Hariharan, and we were trying to figure out some sort of out of the

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.520
[Amit Varma]: box metrics, which showed that women have been empowered. And you know, the image that you

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:02.520
[Amit Varma]: painted of a male patriarch ordering ki, you know, give me mochad dalna and somebody has to and then

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.880
[Amit Varma]: the daughter in law has to clean the banana flower. And but gradually over the ages, as those daughters

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.960
[Amit Varma]: in law become more empowered and can put their foot down, they choose to make cabbage instead.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.440
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, one offbeat metric of empowerment is a move away from banana flower to cabbage.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.640
[Guest]: Oh, actually, you know, one of the best examples is something that has happened,

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.680
[Guest]: maybe if not in our generation, but in our parents generation,

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.440
[Guest]: which is the great shift to stainless steel. I mean, I don't know if you remember this,

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.240
[Guest]: but I do remember like, you know, these these women would come to the houses with these with

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.080
[Guest]: these stainless steel vessels, they were these sort of nomadic women. And they would ask the

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:40.040
[Guest]: women if they had like old saris, which had zari in them. And it was amazing, like how many women

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:45.000
[Guest]: would empty out their chest full of saris and exchange them for these stainless steel vessels.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.840
[Guest]: And in a matter of about a decade, stainless steel, which was a very niche product, it was,

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:55.640
[Guest]: you know, originally used for making armaments. Stainless steel became ubiquitous in Indian

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.160
[Guest]: kitchens for us today, many of us when we think of traditional Indian kitchens,

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.240
[Guest]: we think of stainless steel, all that bright silver, ever silver, it was called

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.480
[Guest]: stainless steel vessels, and you know, shops full of stainless steel vessels. But this happened in

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:12.920
[Guest]: a matter of 10 years. And why did it happen? It's not even that stainless steel is a particularly

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.960
[Guest]: good medium for cooking, it's actually not a particularly good medium, because it doesn't

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:21.400
[Guest]: conduct heat very well. Things like brass and copper are actually much better conductors of

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:27.720
[Guest]: heat. But stainless steel is easy to clean. And if you've ever been through the trouble of

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.840
[Guest]: cleaning brass vessels, you know what a pain it is. I mean, to clean brass vessels properly,

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.880
[Guest]: you need something acidic. So you had these sort of, you know, solutions of tamarind, we had to

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.360
[Guest]: steep and then you had to clean it. And then once or twice every year, you had to get the kalaiwala

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.520
[Guest]: to come. I don't know if you've ever seen that the guys would come and make little fires outside

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:52.680
[Guest]: your house and put the tin lining inside. Taking care of brass vessels is a real pain, they're also

00:24:52.680 --> 00:25:00.280
[Guest]: like really heavy. So within 10 years, women in the kitchen, very happily gave up all their

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:06.600
[Guest]: traditional brass vessels for stainless steel. And that's actually a marvellous heading for the

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.320
[Amit Varma]: journey that the Indian woman has taken from saris to stainless steel, absolutely beautiful

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:15.160
[Amit Varma]: alliterations. We'll take a quick commercial break here. And we'll talk more about Indian

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.640
[Amit Varma]: food and how it is not as Indian as you think, though I would hold that all food is Indian once

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:25.080
[Unknown]: you eat it after this break. Hello, everybody, welcome to another week on the IBM podcast

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.440
[Unknown]: network. If you're not following us on social media, please make sure that you are we are

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:33.480
[Unknown]: IBM podcasts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. I have a little bit of news for people we are

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.640
[Unknown]: releasing a new version of our app. And as part of that we're running a beta program,

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:41.960
[Unknown]: podcast from. And with that, let's continue on with your show. Welcome back to the scene in the

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:46.600
[Amit Varma]: unseen. I'm chatting with Vikram doctor about Indian food and what makes it Indian and where

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:52.840
[Amit Varma]: it actually came from. So Vikram, tell me a little bit more about the different streams of influences

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.760
[Amit Varma]: where they came from, like, obviously, there are trade routes as a silk route, which ended here,

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.640
[Amit Varma]: as you said, there was, you know, the route from the Middle East, I presume, a lot of the influences

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.280
[Amit Varma]: that would have come with the Islamic invasions, and there were the different kind of colonialism,

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:10.840
[Guest]: there were the various, you know, colonial routes of ingredients to India. But there are also routes

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:15.240
[Guest]: that people are less aware of. For instance, we are so conditioned to thinking of products coming

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:21.000
[Guest]: in from the west, that we often ignore all the influences coming from the east. And actually,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.440
[Guest]: especially from South India, especially in Bengal, there are massive traditions of influences from

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:32.200
[Guest]: Southeast Asia, you know, intrinsically Southeast Asian, or Far Eastern, and also from the Americas,

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:36.840
[Guest]: because we, you know, again, because of this Western focus we have, we forget that there was

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:42.280
[Guest]: this huge movement of goods from the New World from South America, over the Pacific by what I

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:47.480
[Guest]: call the Manila galleons. The Manila galleons were these fleets of ships that set off from

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:53.240
[Guest]: Peru, from Mexico to Manila, this is Spanish, because the Philippines was Spanish run. And

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:59.240
[Guest]: arguably, a vast amount of food products came to Asia, over the Pacific through the Manila galleons,

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.880
[Guest]: and spread from there to India. I mean, again, we're hypothesizing which products these were,

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:08.360
[Guest]: but quite probably included pineapples, it could have been cashews, it could have been

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.360
[Guest]: sweet potatoes, which are actually very interesting product, because you may even

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.960
[Guest]: have predated the Manila galleons, and come with the Polynesian, you know, movement across the

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:23.080
[Guest]: Pacific. And the one that's really interesting is chilies, because we are still not very sure

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.480
[Guest]: how chilies came to India. And of course, how they became such an intrinsically part of

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.800
[Guest]: Indian society. Of course, chilies are from South America. That's the one thing we know for sure.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:37.800
[Guest]: But how did chilies become so essentially Indian and, again, we can only speculate, I mean,

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.520
[Guest]: perhaps the best, the most interesting theory was the one put forth by K.T. Acharya, India's pioneering

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:48.280
[Guest]: food historian, whose idea was that chilies substituted a particular spice, which is now

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:53.160
[Guest]: very rare here, which is called long pepper. Long pepper is something called pipali. And if you've

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.480
[Guest]: ever had a really bad cough, you know, your mother might have given you this as a sort of Ayurvedic

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:04.440
[Guest]: preparation in hot milk. It's a variety of pepper, which is long, as the name suggests. And it looks

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:12.040
[Guest]: a bit like a chili. It's much more spicy, much more peppery. And Acharya's theory is that this was

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:17.960
[Guest]: used a lot along with regular black pepper. But the thing about long pepper is that it's not a

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.520
[Guest]: very convenient spice. I mean, A, it grows only where pepper vines grow, which is really the very

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:27.800
[Guest]: much more tropical, you know, rainforest parts of India. It doesn't keep very well. I mean,

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:33.080
[Guest]: you have to pickle it and it's not that as convenient to use. And when chilies came,

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:37.480
[Guest]: chilies are a very easy crop to grow. They grow almost anywhere. People grow chilies in pots in

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:42.600
[Guest]: their house. And you can always have chilies growing and it's a very easy source of heat.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.400
[Guest]: So Acharya's theory and it fits in a way from a lot of what we're talking like what we started

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:52.760
[Guest]: off by saying about the marigolds. We just found chilies to be a much more easier way of getting

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.680
[Guest]: heat into our food than long pepper. And this again goes back to what you were saying about

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.480
[Amit Varma]: pragmatism. Yeah. And it seems to me that therefore a lot of our adopting foreign foods

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.680
[Amit Varma]: is as much an adoption of food itself as an adoption of technology. In the sense that,

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, you want that spiciness in your food instead of the old technology, which is long

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.600
[Amit Varma]: peppers, you adopt a new technology, which is chilies, which are coming from outside and who

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.840
[Amit Varma]: cares where they're coming from? I mean, you adopt them and you make them quintessentially Indian.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:23.400
[Guest]: Yeah. So, you know, the basics of Indian food remain the same. It's just that the means that

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:28.760
[Guest]: we used to get it become slightly different. Another fascinating example is with dals.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:34.360
[Guest]: Now, dal is something that, again, that is very basic and intrinsic to Indian food,

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:40.360
[Guest]: mainly because it's one of our main sources of protein. And we depend upon legumes on beans

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:46.440
[Guest]: a lot more than most other parts of the world. And we have very traditional dals like moong and

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:55.400
[Guest]: masoor and urad dal and also lesser known dals, which we started substituting once we encountered

00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:01.160
[Guest]: the New World dals. Now, this whole process of exchange between these dals you named are Indian.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:06.760
[Guest]: The dals are named Indian. What is not Indian is rajma, for instance. And this is really

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.560
[Guest]: interesting when you think about it, because, you know, you think of rajma chawal as being

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:15.160
[Guest]: this essential North Indian dish, but rajma is not. Rajma is a New World bean. And this process,

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.120
[Guest]: which is called the Colombian exchange of old and New World products being exchanged. Rajma is one

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.600
[Guest]: of the key products that was exchanged. And you can even see it in the name because the hypothesis

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:32.280
[Guest]: is that I named three dals earlier, moong, masoor and urad, which is called mash. And the theory is

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:40.920
[Guest]: that rajma means the king, the large urad, large mash. Okay. And it came to India. It just fitted

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.800
[Guest]: into Indian cooking styles. And now it's an intrinsically part of India as rajma chawal.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.760
[Amit Varma]: That's mind blowing. And what you pointed out earlier before we started talking was,

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, on one hand, you were talking about how idlis are taking over India, which I'll ask you

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.480
[Amit Varma]: to elaborate on. But when I asked you if idlis are Indian, you said that maybe not that there

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:04.760
[Guest]: is a theory that fermentation came from Indonesia. Yeah, I mean, you know, again, as with a lot of

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:10.440
[Guest]: food history, so much is speculation. But it's true that Indonesia is a sort of center point

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:16.280
[Guest]: for lots of fascinating fermented foods, like tempeh, and a whole range of other fermented

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:22.200
[Guest]: foods. And one theory is that idli, which is actually a fermented food, is something that

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:28.360
[Guest]: came from Indonesia through the long Tamil connection with Southeast Asia. And what is

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.240
[Guest]: fascinating, I mean, earlier, I'd spoken about the wheat invasion of South India. But to me,

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:38.920
[Guest]: what has been equally fascinating the last few decades has been the idli invasion of North India,

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.680
[Guest]: because it's happened for a very simple reason. I mean, when I was growing up,

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.760
[Guest]: idlis were seen as madrasi, it was this very South Indian thing, you know, I had friends,

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.280
[Guest]: you know, family friends would come from the north, and they would want to eat like

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:55.000
[Guest]: idlis, you know, because it was intrinsically like, Indian. And it was not that usual to get

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.920
[Guest]: idlis outside South India. Now, you can go across India, and you will find idlis everywhere,

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:05.640
[Guest]: particularly in roadside dhabas. I mean, roadside dhabas have this sort of impression of being very

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.720
[Guest]: North Indian Punjabi, but actually what you can get in them across India is idlis, because they're

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:15.640
[Guest]: seen as light, safe, easy to eat. And this is the key thing, easy to produce in bulk.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.840
[Guest]: One thing that has really empowered idlis to spread across India is that it's the one food

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.640
[Guest]: which is easy to make on a large scale, once especially once wet grinders were invented.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:30.200
[Guest]: We still don't know who invented wet grinders, but it seems likely that wet grinders were invented

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:35.560
[Guest]: somewhere in around Coimbatore, because it has a whole machine parts industry and somebody,

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:41.240
[Guest]: some bright person decided to fit a sort of grinder to the stone inside the stone and you

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:46.520
[Guest]: got wet grinders. And slowly wet grinders started picking up. And restaurants realized that they

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:52.520
[Guest]: could use wet grinders to make the idli batter very easily. And then it was just a question of

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:59.560
[Guest]: steaming them on a large scale. Now compare that to chapatis. Chapatis are strangely enough, one

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:04.360
[Guest]: typically Indian food, which we have not been able to scale up. I mean, yes, there are chapati

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.920
[Guest]: makers, but everybody hates the rotis that come from chapati makers. Some daughters-in-law are

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:14.120
[Guest]: called chapati makers. And you know, this is the problem with chapatis. Chapatis have to be made

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:19.800
[Guest]: one at a time by hand. And people have all sorts of preferences. You know, people don't, some people

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:24.520
[Guest]: like it more puffed, some people like it slightly burnt, some people like it really soft. It's

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:29.880
[Guest]: really difficult to scale up chapatis. Whereas it's very easy to scale up idlis. And for that

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:35.160
[Guest]: reason alone, idlis have become, I would say, our national food in a way that chapatis no longer are.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:39.000
[Amit Varma]: That's quite mind blowing, especially from someone who's grown up eating Bengali and

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.560
[Amit Varma]: North Indian food to hear you describe of idlis as, and the way you spoke of it, you know,

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:48.600
[Amit Varma]: a venture capitalist would love that. What should I invest in? Idlis scale better. And they're also,

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:53.160
[Amit Varma]: again, a metric of empowerment, because chapatis are labor intensive. The labor in Indian kitchens

00:34:53.160 --> 00:35:00.680
[Guest]: is usually done by unpaid women. So hey, in fact, there is one startup, which has become hugely

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:05.400
[Guest]: successful ID, by simply making Italy batter, which can be, you know, sold through chilled

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:11.480
[Guest]: cabinets. And it's become hugely successful. Now, I can go to like any kirana shop in Bombay,

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:15.480
[Guest]: and actually through most parts of most large cities in India and buy ready made Italy batter,

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:21.080
[Guest]: which then I just have to put into a pressure cooker and steam it. So much for my keto diet.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:25.160
[Amit Varma]: I'm not craving idlis. So far, during this conversation, you've spoken of things like

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:31.160
[Amit Varma]: saffron, marigold, chilies, tomatoes, potatoes, beans, rajma, all of which come from outside,

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:36.440
[Amit Varma]: what is there, which is quintessentially Indian? Like, for example, if 2000 years ago, I had to

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.840
[Amit Varma]: have what would then be called an Indian meal? What would it consist of? I realize it's a very

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.120
[Amit Varma]: simplistic question, because there's so many different regions and so on. But you know,

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:50.600
[Guest]: well, obviously, rice, I mean, most Indian foods were based around rice, and a few other products.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:55.400
[Guest]: I mean, bananas, for example, we tend to forget how important bananas have been, because we just

00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:00.200
[Guest]: think of bananas in terms of the ripe fruit, but actually green bananas are cooked as a vegetable,

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:05.000
[Guest]: a very intrinsically Indian preparation, a lot of ritual foods involve green bananas. And

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:09.720
[Guest]: that the text I was mentioning to you earlier, the super shastra, along with banana flowers,

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:16.200
[Guest]: green bananas are one of the vegetables that they use a lot. And bananas, again,

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:21.000
[Guest]: may or may not have originated in India. But certainly, in India is one of the largest

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.880
[Guest]: sources of diversity for bananas. And bananas have gone from India across the world.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.920
[Amit Varma]: But what is really strange... We are a banana republic in that sense.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:37.240
[Guest]: We are a banana republic, we are better than a banana republic, because we have this huge

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.560
[Guest]: diversity of bananas. Okay, whereas the banana republics, which you're talking about are the

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:46.600
[Guest]: Central American countries that started growing bananas for the American market. And these

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.120
[Guest]: countries were growing bananas purely for commercial reasons. The bananas were not

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:55.800
[Guest]: native to these countries, they were vast banana plantations. And the companies like Dole,

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:02.600
[Guest]: and what is now Chiquita Bananas, which invested in these republics and essentially became so

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.880
[Guest]: powerful that they control these republics, which is why they call banana republics,

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.760
[Guest]: only grew one or two types of bananas. That's what they were interested in, because they were

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.960
[Guest]: industrially grown bananas. Now, I am making a point on this, which we will come to,

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.880
[Guest]: but because bananas are something I'm very passionate about. They hit upon only two or

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:24.040
[Guest]: three types of bananas. And the problem with monocultures, if you know anything about

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:28.200
[Guest]: agriculture, is that monocultures are very dangerous, because you get a virus, which

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.680
[Guest]: kills them, you kill all of them. And that's exactly what has happened with bananas, not once,

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:39.720
[Guest]: but twice, that a virus comes, which wipes out a strain of banana completely. And this has been

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:45.720
[Guest]: happening across the world. So when the original type of banana got wiped out, the banana companies

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.960
[Guest]: quickly innovated and found a new type, which is called Cavendish, which has now become the

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.960
[Guest]: universal banana. If you go across to the West, there is only one type of banana that you know,

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:58.840
[Guest]: which is long, beautifully yellow, and completely tasteless. But it's great for the grocery trade.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.520
[Guest]: That's what you know, it's a Cavendish is a banana, which is an industrial banana.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.200
[Guest]: Why do people eat it if it's tasteless?

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.440
[Guest]: Because that's all they know. Americans, people in the West don't know any other type of banana.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.120
[Guest]: You if they come to India, their minds get blown when they eat the sort of banana,

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:16.600
[Guest]: the varieties of bananas that we have over here. But for them, there's only one type of banana.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:21.880
[Guest]: It looks beautiful. It's perfectly yellow. And that's what they see as a banana. Now,

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.040
[Guest]: what has happened is that two or three types of virus are wiping out this,

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:31.560
[Guest]: exactly as happened in the past is repeating. The bananas are being Cavendish is being wiped out

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.680
[Guest]: across the Central American states across the banana, the so called banana republics.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:41.640
[Guest]: So what is happening now is that they're coming to India, and they're growing Cavendish over here,

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:46.360
[Guest]: which is one of the stupidest things possible, because a it's completely tasteless compared to

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.920
[Guest]: our, you know, native bananas, and be it's going to happen here, the virus will come here,

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:56.040
[Guest]: the virus has already started coming out here. But what is awful is because they are growing

00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:01.640
[Guest]: these bananas, and it's been planted in in vast amounts in Maharashtra and Gujarat in particular,

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:07.880
[Guest]: for the Western market, and the surplus is being dumped in the Indian market. So in the last 10

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:13.320
[Guest]: years, 10 years back, I could go to Matunga and Bombay, and I would get five or six types of

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:19.880
[Guest]: bananas from South India, some of them grown in in Versailles. Today, everywhere you get you get

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:26.120
[Guest]: what is called golden banana, which is Cavendish. And it's a disaster. It's tasteless. It's not a

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:32.120
[Guest]: patch on the traditional Indian bananas, like, you know, Rastalis, or all the South Indian bananas.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.120
[Guest]: But it's what we've started growing. And it is really a tragedy.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.840
[Amit Varma]: And there are many cautionary tales in this one of them, of course, is of the value of diversity,

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.680
[Amit Varma]: because we have such a diverse types of bananas, you won't have this kind of thing happening where

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:50.760
[Amit Varma]: a virus cleans it out. And you know, the other is of perhaps a cautionary tale about a certain

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:55.960
[Amit Varma]: kind of globalization, which, you know, wipes out indigenous forms of, in this particular context,

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:01.000
[Amit Varma]: it's banana, but it could be anything, you know, you can extend it to culture and food and whatever.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.520
[Guest]: And, and it's a tragedy of education, you know, because we don't value Indian bananas

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:11.000
[Guest]: in themselves, we have forgotten how good they taste. I mean, I can still go to Tamil Nadu,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.640
[Guest]: luckily, where the you know, Cavendish was not taken over the extent to it as in Bombay or North

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:20.600
[Guest]: India. And you have these amazing bananas, you have a variety of bananas, you know, in a big,

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:26.840
[Guest]: thick slice, some of them slightly chewy, they have the red bananas. And it's a real tragedy

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:32.120
[Guest]: that they're all being wiped out and replaced by this one tasteless banana, which is perfect for

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:36.200
[Guest]: the international trade, which itself is going to get wiped out in time by the virus.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.760
[Amit Varma]: So there's an irony in this that we gave banana to the world, and then they gave a particular

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:48.440
[Guest]: kind of banana to us, which might wipe us out. Absolutely. It's in fact, a similar irony to

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.960
[Amit Varma]: our giving chicken to the world and then being assailed with chicken tikka masala.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.680
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, this is actually an interesting story, too, because

00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:01.640
[Guest]: chickens sort of originated in India. Chickens, the modern chicken is a descendant of the Indian

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:08.360
[Guest]: jungle fowl, which is native to North India and Northeast India. And it does seem to have

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:15.400
[Guest]: been hunted in the past as a sort of game bird. But the domestication of chickens may have happened

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:20.360
[Guest]: somewhere in Northeast India or Southeast Asia. There are different theories about why chickens

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:25.000
[Guest]: in particular were domesticated. For instance, one theory is that actually chickens were

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.800
[Guest]: domesticated not for the chickens themselves, but for cockfighting, because cockfighting is part of

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:35.480
[Guest]: various rituals, even today, and this is controversial, but for some South Indian

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:40.120
[Guest]: festivals, cockfights are seen as traditional and this is being opposed by animal rights activists

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:46.440
[Guest]: very rightly. But so one theory is that chickens were domesticated for cockfighting rituals.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:51.800
[Guest]: The other theory is that chickens were domesticated because unlike, say, ducks,

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:57.320
[Guest]: they don't require water. They adapt quite well to chicken coops and houses. I mean,

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:01.160
[Guest]: there are different theories, but the key point is that the main domestication happened

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:07.240
[Guest]: through Southeast Asia, from where then they spread across to the West and the rest of the world.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:14.920
[Guest]: What happened then is that in around World War Two, there was a huge demand for meat,

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:21.960
[Guest]: especially in America. And the main meat sources, which was beef, was being sent to the battlefields

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:26.680
[Guest]: for all the soldiers. So the people at home had to look for another easy source of meat and chickens

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:31.000
[Guest]: became adopted as a quick, easy source of meat because, you know, you can raise chickens much

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.200
[Guest]: faster. That's when chicken, it's as late as that. I mean, there are certain routes before that,

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.160
[Guest]: but the mass production of chickens really happened during World War Two and post-World

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:46.840
[Guest]: War Two. That's when the broilers were developed because, you know, the Americans were selling

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:51.960
[Guest]: this idea of a world where, you know, of this vast, prosperous America where everybody always

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:58.120
[Guest]: had meat and chickens, broiler chickens, were seen as the meat of the future. So that's when

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:03.080
[Guest]: broiler chickens were developed. This completely unnatural bird, which matures in just a matter

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:09.000
[Guest]: of a few weeks and lives in these, you know, cooped up conditions and develops these huge,

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.480
[Guest]: heavy breast meat. You know, typically, originally chickens didn't have this heavy chicken breast

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:18.040
[Guest]: meat. I mean, this comes with chickens which are bred for like sitting in cooped up conditions.

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:22.520
[Guest]: And broilers developed from there through a lot of other American innovations, for instance,

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:27.560
[Guest]: the spread of antibiotics, because the problem with raising chickens in these cooped up conditions

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:32.440
[Guest]: is that they get diseases and they all fall sick. And coincidentally enough, the 1950s were

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:37.080
[Guest]: when America was discovering all the wonders of antibiotics. And they realized that putting

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:43.640
[Guest]: antibiotics into chicken feed makes chickens grow much faster. And that's where this completely

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:49.320
[Guest]: unnatural bird, which has nothing now in connection really to the Indian jungle fowl, was developed.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:54.360
[Guest]: And now we have taken it into India because we have a vast population which wants meat. And

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.920
[Guest]: chicken is the easiest meat because it can be produced fast. It doesn't have any of the

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:05.000
[Guest]: religious and cultural hassles of pork or beef. So we are developing this vast chicken industry.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.640
[Guest]: So there's a massive irony here that chickens which originate in India are now becoming the

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:18.120
[Guest]: mass Indian meat. But it's a horrible meat. It's a horrible unhealthy meat, which has no

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:22.040
[Amit Varma]: connection at all to the Indian jungle fowl. So in a sense, chickens have traveled the same

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:25.960
[Amit Varma]: distance with bananas. The modern chicken is like the Cavendish banana or the golden banana

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:30.200
[Guest]: and it's tasteless and it's come from the West. It's come from the way we gave them the original

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:35.080
[Guest]: thing. And it is this completely I mean, you know, once you read the research that's going

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:39.880
[Guest]: into the problems of antibiotic use and in chicken feed, and this is spilling over into humans,

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:45.640
[Guest]: because antibiotic resistance is rising because of this vast lavish use of antibiotics in animal

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:53.320
[Guest]: feed among other reasons. So it's deeply disturbing to see this this huge upsurge in chicken production

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:59.480
[Amit Varma]: in India. So within our culture, how do we keep our sense of what is Indian food? For example,

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.880
[Amit Varma]: you might say that bananas and chickens are Indian, but as you just, you know, pointed out,

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:08.440
[Amit Varma]: what a lot of people who might now go to Matunga and buy golden bananas think of as Indian isn't

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:14.600
[Amit Varma]: really Indian. How do we preserve our sense of what is Indian food regardless of where it

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:20.200
[Guest]: originated from? I mean, I think we just need to look at authenticity in buying food. I mean,

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:24.520
[Guest]: you know, authenticity is a problematic concept, because then, you know, people get into things of

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.760
[Guest]: like, you know, disputes or whatever is, you know, really authentic, etc. I think we should just look

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:33.960
[Guest]: at authenticity in terms of produced in the simplest possible way, you know, trying to buy it

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:38.360
[Guest]: as close to the producers as possible. One of the really encouraging things that's happening across

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:44.600
[Guest]: India is that we are seeing a lot of farmers, farmers markets, people, you know, producers

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:49.640
[Guest]: selling food directly to consumers. And that's really important. I mean, supermarkets do have

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:54.760
[Guest]: a role to play in the wider business sense, but the level to which supermarkets have grown in the

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:59.720
[Guest]: West, and in the developed world, to the extent to which they control both consumers and producers

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:05.480
[Amit Varma]: is a deeply disturbing. And you could argue that the impetus behind that is the same impetus

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:12.520
[Amit Varma]: behind this wonderful exchange of cultures, which is pragmatism. Yeah, absolutely. Look,

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:17.160
[Guest]: supermarkets have many benefits. Okay, I'm not going to argue with somebody who's at the end of

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:23.000
[Guest]: a busy day, doesn't find the time to go to a farmer's market, and actually, you know, get the

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.960
[Guest]: produce and clean themselves. It's true, we need convenience, we need, you know, to be able to make

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:33.640
[Guest]: things easily. It's just that we need to look at the larger costs involved. And sometimes the costs

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:39.640
[Guest]: involved with supermarkets and are not visible to us, but are very real, and deeply problematic,

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:43.160
[Guest]: like, for instance, the cost of health issues that are coming from, you know, antibiotic fed

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:48.920
[Amit Varma]: chickens. Is it then fair to say that while, say, the history of Indian food or the history of

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:53.240
[Amit Varma]: Indian cuisine has been a journey where we take influences from everywhere, whether for pragmatic

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:58.760
[Amit Varma]: reasons or otherwise, and, and it all becomes Indian once it's adopted. So it's not fair to say,

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:03.000
[Amit Varma]: for example, that chilies or tomatoes or rajma aren't Indian once we've adopted them and made

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.240
[Amit Varma]: them our own, they are Indian. But now we've come to this place where we are taking a journey almost

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:13.480
[Amit Varma]: in the opposite direction, we're driven by the same pragmatism as before, we are now, you know,

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:18.440
[Amit Varma]: changing these food habits and adopting, for example, Cavendish bananas, and what you call

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:25.800
[Amit Varma]: antibiotic fed modern chickens, and moving away from what can and cannot be described as our roots.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.800
[Guest]: Right. I just think, as I said, people need to be a bit more mindful about the food. And

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:34.200
[Guest]: what what makes it a lot easier is that a lot of these foods are still available in India.

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:38.520
[Guest]: You know, many of these foods, which, you know, have been taken up by the West as these

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:43.720
[Guest]: fantastic modern ingredients are actually available in India. They're available in two

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:49.720
[Guest]: sources. One, they're available as part of rituals, a lot of traditional Indian foods survive as part

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:55.320
[Guest]: of of temple rituals. So for instance, during this whole thing, during upvas that we don't eat

00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:00.760
[Guest]: grains, I mean, it's an interesting practice, because what essentially is happening is upvas

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:06.520
[Guest]: upvas foods go back to the traditional Indian foods, you know, the Indian foods of the field

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:10.360
[Guest]: of the jungle. I mean, that's the sort of idea that you would eat the food that the rishis would

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.920
[Guest]: eat. Now, again, a lot of food that is actually eaten during upvas is like things like sweet

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:19.320
[Guest]: potatoes, which are not intrinsically Indian. But at least it's a way of giving you a diversity,

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:24.200
[Guest]: you know, for upvas, you will not eat rice or wheat or something like that you'll eat millets.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:30.760
[Guest]: Okay, and many millets like ragi are very intrinsically Indian. And so simply because of these

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:37.480
[Guest]: upvas rituals for temple purposes, a lot of foods are preserved and are available in India. One of

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:42.200
[Guest]: the biggest struggles in the West has been just making these foods available. Actually, in India,

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:46.440
[Guest]: most of these foods available, you just have to go to a traditional market, you have to ask

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:50.520
[Guest]: grandmothers, because many of the upvas rituals are kept up by grandmothers, and they know where

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.280
[Amit Varma]: to get all these foods. But is that going to change with time with the decline of the joint family?

00:48:54.280 --> 00:49:00.040
[Guest]: And you know, it might, it absolutely might. But what is great is that people for health benefits

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:04.360
[Guest]: are rediscovering the values of all these foods. And the other way that all these foods are

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:08.680
[Guest]: available is actually with poor people. Because the many of these traditional foods because they

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:14.840
[Guest]: look down on are seen as food only for poor people. And yet they're available in a city

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:19.800
[Guest]: like Bombay. And it's quite fascinating. I often you know, sometimes when I go to markets,

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:25.000
[Guest]: I don't go into the main market, because the main market is where all the sort of prestige

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.200
[Guest]: vegetables, what you call English vegetables are sold. But if you look on the margins of markets,

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:35.080
[Guest]: you will find old lady sitting, they'll have a bed sheet, a piece of cloth, and they'll have

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:41.000
[Guest]: some bunches of greens of, you know, which they have picked, it could be like drumstick leaves,

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:48.040
[Guest]: it could be things like Malabar spinach, it could be like, there's a whole range of pumpkin flowers,

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:54.120
[Guest]: a whole range of, of forage greens, which are just available for anybody who goes out and picks them.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:50:00.680
[Guest]: And these are available very cheap. And they're sold for people who know them, who know their

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:06.680
[Guest]: value, they're often extremely healthy, because they have all sorts of nutrients, which are not

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:10.840
[Guest]: necessarily available in the in the sort of prestigious vegetables. But they're there for

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:17.320
[Guest]: poor people. I mean, for instance, like, one type of green I found being sold in the mill areas,

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:22.680
[Guest]: actually safflower, kardi, safflower leaves, okay, not the oil, which is what are pressed and used

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:26.520
[Guest]: for, you know, safflower oil, but the greens of safflower. Now, this is a very traditional

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:31.400
[Guest]: vegetable in interior Maharashtra, which is where a lot of the mill workers come from. And it's

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:36.200
[Guest]: still sold in Bombay in these areas. It's a delicious green, but I can only buy it on the

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:41.640
[Guest]: roadside. I will never find it in a market, even on a supermarket. So if I may take this opportunity,

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:46.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, for listeners of my show who like to cook, why don't you recommend four or five

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:50.280
[Amit Varma]: interesting offbeat things which they won't find in supermarkets, which you'd recommend them to try?

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:56.920
[Guest]: Um, well, drumstick leaves, I mean, you know, if you want a plant that is very deeply Indian,

00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:01.000
[Guest]: it's drumstick, sanskari plant, sanskari plant, absolutely. And drumstick are a wonderful plant,

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.440
[Guest]: because it's a tree for one thing, which means that it produces through the year,

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.840
[Guest]: the drumsticks, which are what we're familiar with is water going to like sambar and

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:13.320
[Guest]: daal and dishes like that. But the leaves also extremely nutritious. I mean, it's actually

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:19.720
[Guest]: fascinating. In Africa, there are whole, you know, NGOs that are devoted to like selling the benefits

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:26.280
[Guest]: of Moringa, as it's called. And you get all these projects to grow Moringa within cities. I've seen

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:30.840
[Guest]: projects where, you know, schoolchildren are encouraged to grow Moringa so that the leaves

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:36.200
[Guest]: are used. Leaves are an extremely great source of nutrition and protein. And again, this is

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:42.360
[Guest]: something which is sold by the roadside. So Moringa is one. Dried fish is another product,

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:48.360
[Guest]: which again is falling out of fashion completely. And in Bombay, in particular, dried fish is very

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.920
[Guest]: intrinsic to Bombay. You could say that dried fish was one of the things that almost founded

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:58.440
[Guest]: Bombay. Because if you look back at the history of Bombay, you know, Bombay was a very poor place.

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:03.400
[Guest]: I mean, it has very little to recommend itself. It had a harbour, but that was about it. I mean,

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:09.240
[Guest]: there were no natural products, there was nothing really. It had coconut trees, and it had dried

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:15.000
[Guest]: fish. I mean, dried Bombay duck, basically. And you can read reports, the British moaning and

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.760
[Guest]: groaning about the smell of dried fish, you know, just like even now, today, in sort of swanky

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:26.120
[Guest]: neighbourhoods like Bandra, or Warsaw, you have people trying to stop the, you know, the fishermen's

00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:30.200
[Guest]: colonies drying fish, because it's the smell is reducing the value of all these really expensive

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:35.880
[Guest]: apartments. And yet dried fish is intrinsic to Bombay. It was a very important product for a

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:42.040
[Guest]: very simple reason. During the monsoons, the boats couldn't go out. And so, you didn't get fish. So,

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:46.920
[Guest]: you had to have dried fish. Dried fish was your key protein source, which tied you to over the

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.800
[Guest]: monsoon months. And there's a whole range of dishes that the traditional Bombay communities,

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:58.520
[Guest]: like the Pathare Prabhus or the CKPs, cook, which use dried fish. They're vegetable dishes,

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:04.280
[Guest]: which use dried fish or dried shrimp to add flavour. They're delicious dishes. Because,

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:08.760
[Guest]: you know, just a little bit of dried shrimp or dried fish adds a great depth to your dish. It's

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:15.080
[Guest]: like the way fish sauce is used in Thai food or Southeast Asian food. But unfortunately,

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:19.320
[Guest]: we've stopped cooking these dishes, because there's one uncomfortable fact about dried fish,

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:23.480
[Guest]: it really smells. And now that we live in apartment buildings, and now that we have

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:28.280
[Guest]: enclosed kitchens, the dried fish smell is really hard to get, the neighbours will complain.

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:33.560
[Guest]: No restaurant wants to serve dried fish dishes, because what they say is that the smell will

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:36.920
[Guest]: come into the dining room. Hotel restaurants can't serve dried fish dishes, because they

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:41.480
[Guest]: sell this, the stink will come into the hotel rooms. So, these dried fish dishes, which are

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:46.920
[Guest]: really delicious, nutritious, and important to India, are completely vanishing from our lives.

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:48.360
[Guest]: What else? Moringa, dried fish?

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:53.960
[Guest]: Moringa, dried fish, well, banana flower, you know, green jackfruit, all these

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.880
[Guest]: things that are becoming trendy abroad. I mean, these are all the sort of like,

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.840
[Guest]: foods that people really should try and experiment with.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:04.520
[Amit Varma]: So tell me something. I mean, earlier in the episode, we were talking about restaurants and

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:08.760
[Amit Varma]: how you know, I had done an episode with Ashok Malik about TV channels. And he made an interesting

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.880
[Amit Varma]: point there that the license cost of TV channels, just setting up and running them is so incredibly

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:18.040
[Amit Varma]: high, that they end up aiming for the lowest common denominator, and you don't get enough

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:24.840
[Amit Varma]: variety and diversity. And the same point has been made by, for example, Amit Doshi of IVM

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:29.480
[Amit Varma]: podcast, who partner with me in producing the scene in the unseen, where he talks about radio,

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:32.920
[Amit Varma]: and he says that, you know, you look at the diversity of radio in New York and contrast

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:36.440
[Amit Varma]: it with India, where the license fees are so high, that lowest common denominator.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:40.520
[Amit Varma]: So everyone's churning out Bollywood music. And you pointed out at the start of this episode,

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.920
[Amit Varma]: that it's the same with restaurants, that restaurants are fundamentally such an expensive,

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:49.000
[Amit Varma]: high investment business because of real estate and blah, blah, blah, that they aim for the

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.160
[Amit Varma]: lowest common denominator. In your early days as a restaurant critic, this frustrated you,

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:57.720
[Amit Varma]: because I presume you'd get the same butter chicken everywhere. Is this changing? I mean,

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:03.720
[Amit Varma]: because culturally, I think, in a sense, you have more openness and more influences coming in even

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:08.200
[Amit Varma]: from outside. But a lot of the new restaurants that I see, and this is obviously my bias,

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:13.000
[Amit Varma]: because I'm a relatively westernized elite here. A lot of the new restaurants I see will be like

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:19.480
[Amit Varma]: molecular gastronomy kind of restaurants and more influences from the West. But is is a diversity

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:25.400
[Amit Varma]: of Indian food beyond what the West has sent back to us finding any kind of expression?

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:29.320
[Guest]: I think there are a few positive signs. I mean, one of them actually is YouTube.

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:34.040
[Guest]: You know, a lot of people have realized that YouTube is a great way to chronicle recipes.

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:39.880
[Guest]: There are so many YouTube channels or YouTube videos of Indian housewives making very traditional

00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:45.080
[Guest]: Indian recipes that are really useful. Because I mean, you are allowed to see the sort of slight

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:49.160
[Guest]: hand movements, you know, especially when you're making something like rotis. It's very minute

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:53.800
[Guest]: things like the hand, how you roll the dough, whether you throw a little bit of water on the

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:58.120
[Guest]: tawa to create a bit of steam before you put the bakri on it, which prevents the bakri from sticking

00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:03.240
[Guest]: on the tawa. These are the very subtle things which are sometimes very hard to write in a recipe.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:07.000
[Guest]: But YouTube allows you to capture that. So I think one of the really important things that's

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:12.920
[Guest]: happening is that YouTube is allowing a lot of people to chronicle a lot of very traditional

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:17.640
[Guest]: Indian recipes. I mean, I'm not saying that the videos are often great. I mean, often the picture

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:22.200
[Guest]: quality is a bit iffy and things like that. But at least the recipes are being chronicled.

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:27.640
[Guest]: I think the fact that it's becoming easier to publish a book is allowing a lot of people to

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:33.880
[Guest]: publish very traditional recipes. In the last 10 years, most of the really fascinating cookbooks,

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:37.640
[Guest]: I know, that chronicle traditional Indian recipes have been self-published.

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.480
[Guest]: What would you recommend for my listeners?

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.920
[Guest]: I mean, it's hard to recommend these because, you know, they're very hard to get by the nature of

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:48.280
[Guest]: being self-published, because, you know, they're often not available on Amazon or places like that.

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:54.520
[Guest]: But there are amazing community initiatives, nearly all run by women, which are chronicling

00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:59.960
[Guest]: traditional recipes. And, you know, one amazing cookbook is a book called Dadi Mano Varso,

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:05.800
[Guest]: which means the grandmother's treasury, which is an attempt to chronicle the recipes of the

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.160
[Guest]: Palanpuri Jains. Now, if you know anything about the Palanpuri Jains, they're a really interesting

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:12.920
[Guest]: community, because they're very rich, because they're the community that controls the diamond

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:17.560
[Guest]: business. And so, you know, they're across the world, wherever diamonds are traded and sold

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:24.680
[Guest]: and cut. But because they're so spread out, a lot of the people in the Palanpuri Jain community

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:30.680
[Guest]: have started worrying that they are going to lose out the very traditional Palanpuri Jain recipes.

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.840
[Guest]: And these are recipes that are interesting for multiple reasons. One, obviously, they're Jain,

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:40.200
[Guest]: so they won't cook a lot of like root vegetables and things like that. So they use things like

00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:46.600
[Guest]: fruits, like guavas and, you know, fruits and a lot of dried vegetables, desert vegetables,

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:51.880
[Guest]: because Palanpur is very close to Rajasthan. So you have a lot of like those sort of dried

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:57.720
[Guest]: Rajasthani vegetables, which are used in their cooking. So a group of women in Bombay,

00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:02.360
[Guest]: got together and decided to chronicle the recipes. And because they had money, they were able to put

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:06.680
[Guest]: a lot of money into doing it. It's an amazing cookbook. It's half in Gujarati, half in English,

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:11.880
[Guest]: because they wanted to make it really accessible. It costs about 650 rupees to buy, which is much

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:18.440
[Guest]: less than the cost of production. But it's an absolutely detailed, painstaking chronicling

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:24.440
[Guest]: of every part of the community's cooking down to the utensils that are used. And you know,

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:28.360
[Guest]: all the traditional dried ingredients that are going to making Palanpuri Jain food.

00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.440
[Guest]: And like that, there are different community initiatives. Sometimes they're not community

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:37.080
[Guest]: initiatives, sometimes just a family. It's becoming very common now for people to do

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:41.880
[Guest]: tribute cookbooks to their mothers or their grandmothers. And these books are always interesting.

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:46.360
[Guest]: I mean, I have a huge collection of them, simply because they have one or two offbeat,

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:53.400
[Guest]: really unusual recipes, which are chronicled in them. I mean, what would be great was if some way

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:58.760
[Guest]: these books could become available, you know, on Amazon. And to some extent that's happening. I

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:03.560
[Guest]: mean, there are a few print on demand producers. I mean, there's a company called Notion Press in

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:08.360
[Guest]: Chennai, which is doing this. And they are offering a sort of pejorative term for this

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:13.400
[Guest]: is vanity publishing. But basically, it's publishing for you. And you you chronicle it.

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:18.280
[Guest]: And they produce a nice quality book, and they put it on Amazon, they get the ISBN number,

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:21.320
[Guest]: and they do all that back and stuff. And they'll even do an ebook if you want it.

00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:27.480
[Guest]: And it's these sort of publishers, who are not the big well known publishers,

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:32.760
[Guest]: who I think are doing an amazing job in helping a lot of Indian cooking get documented.

00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:36.360
[Amit Varma]: So that might keep the recipes alive, but are ingredients getting extinct?

00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:41.400
[Guest]: I mean, it's some ingredients like all the banana varieties are definitely becoming harder to find.

00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:48.040
[Guest]: But again, I mean, I try to be hopeful. And I think what is helping here is the growth of

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:53.320
[Guest]: traditional markets, or the growth of farmers markets, small markets, people really becoming

00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:57.080
[Guest]: interested in these sort of things who are trying to make these recipes available. Many of these

00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:02.840
[Guest]: ingredients are being promoted for health benefits, which may or may not be true. I mean,

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.320
[Guest]: not all of them are what they're touted to be. But if people believe that because they're healthy,

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.320
[Guest]: they're going to keep consuming it, then I'm all for it.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:13.240
[Amit Varma]: And I'm going to sort of, I've taken a lot of your time, I'm going to end this episode by asking

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:19.160
[Amit Varma]: you a question or version of which I ask all my guests on the topic of their expertise. I mean,

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:24.200
[Amit Varma]: in a sense, what I realized talking about Indian food with you is that talking about Indian food,

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.800
[Amit Varma]: in a sense is talking about globalization, right? Because all of Indian food, I mean,

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:33.960
[Amit Varma]: this globalization has been with us for 1000s of years, right? And all of Indian food is basically,

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:38.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, to use a cliched phrase, a melting pot, right? And, and we see the same process

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:44.280
[Amit Varma]: of globalization now accelerating and bringing about, you know, different manifestations of it,

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:49.240
[Amit Varma]: in some cases, you have, you know, supermarkets driving out local markets, and you know,

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:54.920
[Amit Varma]: Cavendish driving out all our different kinds of bananas, but equally, you have our recipes

01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:01.960
[Amit Varma]: proliferating on YouTube, and so on and so forth. So my two part question, what makes you hopeful?

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:08.520
[Amit Varma]: And what makes you despair about the trends of globalization with reference to Indian food?

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:14.760
[Guest]: Well, what makes me hopeful, I think, is the fact that I started off by saying that the fact that

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.360
[Guest]: I started writing about food writing, because I could talk to anybody about food,

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:23.000
[Guest]: food is the one thing that connects everyone, and everybody is interested in food, you can talk to

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.360
[Guest]: anyone about food and their food memories, and their food experiences, and you have a way of

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:33.480
[Guest]: connecting with everybody. So we're dealing with something that is of a lot of interest to people.

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.560
[Guest]: I mean, we can see it in the way that politicians often use food metaphors, you know, in their

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:43.160
[Guest]: speeches, because they know that food connects with people at a very primal level. So I think

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:49.160
[Guest]: we're dealing with something that is very basic, that is very that really literally hits people at

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.960
[Guest]: a gut level. And it's always easy to interest people in food. So that's the positive side.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:00.680
[Guest]: The thing that makes me a bit, I don't know, despairing, but definitely sad, is that people

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:06.200
[Guest]: don't open their minds, and they don't want to experiment with food, they become very closed.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:11.720
[Guest]: And you know, one thing that I find particularly depressing is the sort of rigidity with which we're

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.840
[Guest]: getting into the vegetarian, non vegetarian divide, which was essentially not something that

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:21.080
[Guest]: was there in India in the past. I mean, yes, you had some vegetarians, and you had a few people

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:25.240
[Guest]: who ate a lot of meat, but those people were traditionally, you know, just a very few rich

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:31.480
[Guest]: people. Most people ate a sort of mixed diet, which was largely vegetarian, but many of them

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:36.920
[Guest]: did eat meat in small doses. Sometimes, as I said, we were talking about dried fish as flavorings in

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:42.120
[Guest]: their food. And these are very important, very nutritious, completely delicious dishes. And they're

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:47.880
[Guest]: getting completely lost, because we are seeing a polarization between vegetarian and non vegetarian.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:53.320
[Guest]: Vegetarians are becoming fanatically vegetarian, they won't even eat eggs or any kind of meat.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:57.400
[Guest]: And sadly enough, non vegetarians also becoming fanatically non vegetarian, because if you want

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.560
[Guest]: they want to eat chicken, they just want to eat chicken, you know, they just want to eat full on

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:07.400
[Amit Varma]: meat. For many North Indians it's almost a macho thing. Or they do keto diets like you do.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.800
[Guest]: So yeah, there's a macho element. Exactly, you know, and people are more prosperous,

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:16.120
[Guest]: which is a good thing. I mean, we should never be sad that people are prosperous. I mean,

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:20.280
[Guest]: that's awful. And because they're prosperous, they want more meat. And that's, you know,

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:25.640
[Guest]: prosperity is always a good thing. But it's a bit sad if they define prosperity as only eating meat.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:30.920
[Guest]: And in the process, I think a lot of traditional Indian foods are getting lost. I mean,

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:35.240
[Guest]: what I call these semi vegetarian foods, which are very important, delicious dishes,

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:39.800
[Guest]: the nutritious dishes, and the environmentally important dishes, because I mean, there is

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:45.320
[Guest]: certainly a cost that is being attached to this huge rise in meat consumption. There's a cost

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:50.280
[Guest]: that is coming in things like the rising antibiotic use, there's an ethical cost,

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.440
[Guest]: which is coming in the ill treatment of animals. And, you know, this is something I think,

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:59.400
[Guest]: food writers will have to grapple with. Like a lot of people, I have mixed feelings about the

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:04.840
[Guest]: vegan movement. But I think the vegan movement is really challenging us to think about essential

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:10.520
[Guest]: things like how is it possible if you are well off and again, this is a position that comes from a

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:15.160
[Guest]: position of luxury, I will never, I do not think you can ever tell a person who's starving, like

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:21.800
[Guest]: don't eat meat. But if you're a well off person, and you have the option of not eating meat from

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:27.240
[Guest]: the sort of industrial production of meat, where you know that there is so much abuse of animals,

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:34.440
[Guest]: the rampant use of antibiotics, how can you continue to eat meat unquestioningly? I'm not

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:40.760
[Guest]: saying don't eat meat. I'm saying question it. And India actually has a solution to all of these

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:46.360
[Guest]: issues to many of these issues. Vegan food is natural to India in a way that it is not in most

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:52.120
[Guest]: parts of the world. We have these vast vegan, vegetarian, semi vegetarian traditions. And we're

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:56.600
[Guest]: forgetting those. And I think that's a bit sad. So that would have been a good note to end. But

01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.600
[Amit Varma]: I thought of another question to ask you, when you mentioned the ethical dilemmas of meat eating,

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.760
[Amit Varma]: which is, I think at some point in the future, it's only a question of when we can argue about

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.120
[Amit Varma]: but at some point is definitely going to happen that is going to become commercially viable to

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.600
[Amit Varma]: have lab grown meat. Absolutely. When no animal was killed, you've just basically synthesized an

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:18.200
[Amit Varma]: entire animal, right? And it looks like chicken, it tastes like chicken, but it was never alive

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.160
[Amit Varma]: to begin with. It's fascinating. And it's fascinating. And that's going to happen. And

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.560
[Amit Varma]: when that happens, I can imagine that someone like you would respond in two ways. The negative

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:29.560
[Amit Varma]: response would be that all food diversity is struck down the same way that you've been on the

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:34.280
[Amit Varma]: loss of the jungle fowl, right? That it hits food diversity, but ethically, then it's a great boon,

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:38.760
[Guest]: because it'll be it'll be a great boon. And I think it's a reminder to us that, you know,

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:43.560
[Guest]: tradition, diversity, I mean, are all important things. But there are other issues like

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:48.440
[Guest]: animal welfare, health, environmental costs that also have to be taken into account.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.400
[Amit Varma]: That's a fantastic note to end the episode on. Thanks so much for coming on the show,
