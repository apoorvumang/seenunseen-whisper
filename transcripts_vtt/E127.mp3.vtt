[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
[Amit Varma]: Give me your loins. It is like offering land to a Brahman."

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.240
[Amit Varma]: Now her husband appears and this young Dalit man also starts advising the Brahman lech

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.120
[Amit Varma]: about the need to be free from earthly desires. But Murubhatu will have none of it. He says,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.880
[Amit Varma]: when a ravishing young woman is free from her clothes, that's freedom for me.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.520
[Amit Varma]: The Dalit gentleman finally agrees to give his wife to the Brahman, as if she is a thing,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.600
[Amit Varma]: an offering to be made. But then Lord Shiva himself arrives and saves the situation.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.040
[Amit Varma]: But the question asked at the end of the play is an apt one. The playwright, Shahuji Bhosale

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.880
[Amit Varma]: asks the audience, you who have seen this play, decide for yourselves and tell us, who

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.880
[Amit Varma]: among these four is the best?

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:50.880
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.880
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bhanu.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.360
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen. Indian history is endlessly rich and fascinating

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.240
[Amit Varma]: and nothing illustrates that better than the story I narrated a few moments ago, which

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.320
[Amit Varma]: is from Manu Pillay's marvellous book, The Courtesan, The Mahatma and The Italian Brahman.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.480
[Amit Varma]: I recorded an episode with Manu a few months ago called The Deccan Before Shivaji, which

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.880
[Amit Varma]: will be linked from the show notes. We spoke in that episode about his book Rebel Sultans,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.440
[Amit Varma]: which is a wild and wonderful chronicle that is more gripping than Lord of the Rings, more

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.600
[Amit Varma]: magical than Harry Potter, more blood splattered than Game of Thrones. And it was all real,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.480
[Amit Varma]: full of stuff that actually happened. History is wild and exciting and Indians are a crazy

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.400
[Amit Varma]: people with a mad, tumultuous, horny past. Manu's latest book, The Courtesan, The Mahatma

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.400
[Amit Varma]: and The Italian Brahman has 61 essays on Indian history and is filled with some amazing stories

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.360
[Amit Varma]: which I will discuss with him today. But first, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.120
[Amit Varma]: This episode of The Seen and The Unseen is brought to you by Storytel. Storytel is an

[Amit Varma]: audiobook platform which you can listen to on your Android or iOS app. They have thousands

[Amit Varma]: And you can also get a 30 day free trial if you hop on over to storytel.com slash IBM.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.880
[Amit Varma]: I actually use Storytel myself regularly. So as long as they sponsor the show, I'm going

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.840
[Amit Varma]: to recommend one book a week that I love. The book I want to recommend today is a book

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.960
[Amit Varma]: called Dear Life by Alice Munro. Alice Munro is my favorite living writer. She's a short

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.000
[Amit Varma]: story writer based in Canada. She's got the Booker International Prize as well as a Nobel

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.200
[Amit Varma]: Prize for literature. And although most of her work is in the form of short stories,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.280
[Amit Varma]: she has a unique ability to compress so much depth into each short story that you feel

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.720
[Amit Varma]: like it's a novelistic universe. Of all the books, the one that is available in Storytel

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.880
[Amit Varma]: and I recommend you read is a collection called Dear Life. And remember, you get a 30 day

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.520
[Amit Varma]: free trial only at storytel.com slash IBM.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.520
[Amit Varma]: Manu, welcome back to the scene and the unseen. Thank you. It's great to be here again. Right.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.600
[Amit Varma]: So we had, you know, I put it out on Twitter that you were recording with me and solicited

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.960
[Amit Varma]: questions. And when I last checked, there weren't too many of them. But one of the questions

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.400
[Amit Varma]: was, you know, how do you manage to write so much history? So you know, on what's your

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.440
[Amit Varma]: normal day like? How do you find things to read? How do you kind of go? I'm actually

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.000
[Guest]: quite glad that this is a podcast, not a video, because people could see me just now, to be

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.120
[Guest]: able to see the dark circles and the horrible hair and all of that. That's, you know, it's

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.480
[Guest]: one of those things, which is that there's a lot of reading, yet fairly isolating. When

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.920
[Guest]: I'm in one of my research cycles, it's 12 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours of research work

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.480
[Guest]: where you go to the library, say at nine in the morning, and you only get up by 830 when

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.720
[Guest]: the library really shuts. And all that time you're sitting at a desk, not uttering a word,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.960
[Guest]: and everyone around you is silent as well. And then you just plot through all the books

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.360
[Guest]: that you need to gather information from. But then writing that phase is also equally

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.400
[Guest]: equally taxing, because what happens is then again, you know, it's sitting down and getting

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.000
[Guest]: the first draft done means weeks and weeks and weeks of not moving from a desk, locking

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.160
[Guest]: myself up in a room, surviving on chocolates and sweets, because that gives you energy

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.120
[Guest]: highs, which is sugar is poison. Yeah, but it's useful at certain times. It's one of

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.600
[Guest]: those phases. And then, you know, after that, of course, comes the fun, because once the

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.040
[Guest]: book is done, once this whole cycle of writing, the research, the writing, the editing, the

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.120
[Guest]: actual publishing happens, then you have the lit fests and the events and things like that,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.120
[Guest]: which is fun, because finally, you can go back to being an extrovert, you can go back

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.200
[Guest]: to talking to people, seeing people having fun, having your glass of champagne and things

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.400
[Amit Varma]: like that. So it's really very compartmentalized. Are you kind of naturally an extrovert who

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.360
[Amit Varma]: likes to be social and you do you have to force yourself? Yeah, I mean, I don't think

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.680
[Guest]: sitting in a library for 12 hours a day is easy for me. It wasn't earlier, at least.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.160
[Guest]: But with my first book, I got six years of practice. And then now things have become

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.440
[Amit Varma]: a little easier because I've picked up speed. And the ivory throne, of course, is 700 pages.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:01.360
[Guest]: This book is only 350. No, this is 383. I think the text is. Yeah, I always have lots

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.960
[Amit Varma]: of pages devoted to notes. Yeah, which are great and most readable. So I was just curious,

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this book is really a collection of your columns in an expanded version plus additional

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.280
[Amit Varma]: material. And I'm just wondering, since you write a weekly column for mint, how difficult

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.520
[Amit Varma]: does that make it in terms of the research? Because typically, I'd imagine when you research

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.680
[Amit Varma]: a book, it's one subject, you get 50 books on that one subject and you dive right in.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.280
[Amit Varma]: But each of the columns is about something completely separate different periods. How

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.960
[Guest]: do you manage that? So one of the things is, you know, for the last several years, I've

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.640
[Guest]: made it a habit that every time I read something, I make notes, whatever book it is, no matter

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.800
[Guest]: where it comes from, I end up making notes. So for example, you know, I did a column once

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.840
[Guest]: on Jinnah because I 12,000 words of notes on him, even though I never really intended

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.240
[Guest]: to do anything, which just happens that I have that much in notes sitting in a Word

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.120
[Guest]: document in my computer. So every week when I have to do my column, I just open up my

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.680
[Guest]: archives if I can't think of anything, and then you know, pull out something from there

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.880
[Guest]: and use that to come up with a new topic. You know, so that's that's the usual process

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.520
[Guest]: every week and because it's history does require a certain amount of integrity, a certain amount

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.560
[Guest]: of focus and so on, because it's a time when lots of people can write very loose history,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.880
[Guest]: you can do your Google and your Google Books at most and think that you've got everything,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.880
[Guest]: but it takes a little bit more. So even in this collection, for example, there's you

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.320
[Guest]: know, one of the essays on Savarkar, it's archival material. It's all based on material

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.720
[Guest]: I found in the British archives quite randomly. Other stuff, for example, is from secondary

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.760
[Guest]: material and maybe a few books that I've read. A lot of it is from J store and sources like

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.000
[Guest]: that where they have academic journals. And my job then is to color all of this and not

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.040
[Guest]: simplify it, but make it more appealing, make it more engaging. Try and tell it like a story

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.960
[Guest]: so that people are interested. But even then it's a two step process because what happens

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.640
[Guest]: is usually a column ends up being written in about 2000 words 1500 to 2000. Then have

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.960
[Guest]: to keep pulling it down to 1000 which is my word limit for mint because the print newspaper

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.040
[Guest]: right so there's a fixed space allocated for it. And you know, in the first six months

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.680
[Guest]: it used to be a challenge because I'd fight with them saying give me 200 words extra give

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.200
[Guest]: me this, you know, 50 words extra. And even now I occasionally get emails saying can you

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.920
[Guest]: chop off 30 words here or 20 words there? Because it's all Yeah, so the original versions

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.280
[Guest]: were filed away quietly. And then when two or three publishers started showing interest

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.640
[Guest]: in the columns themselves, I said, Well, you know, there are longer versions might as well

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.000
[Amit Varma]: use that. So yeah, and what's the process of reading like, like, imagine on one hand,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.440
[Amit Varma]: if you're sort of researching, you're doing deep reading, you're reading really carefully

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.200
[Amit Varma]: taking notes. But on the other hand, you have a lot of material to get through, especially

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.200
[Amit Varma]: if this historical material, there's a temptation to just skim through stuff. How do you manage

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.880
[Guest]: that? Yeah, I mean, as I said, the first six years because my first book required me to

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.440
[Guest]: sort of sit in the archives in the library for hours and hours and hours, and devote

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.600
[Guest]: the first half of my 20s to that whole process. I've picked up a degree of speed in the sense

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.400
[Guest]: that you know, I can get through say one book in two days or a day and a half. Because I'm

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.320
[Guest]: not reading it for pleasure. I know exactly what I'm looking for. I know, when I see a

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.640
[Guest]: fact whether or not I use it, I don't know. But I know that fact is interesting. So I

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.240
[Guest]: know how to take it out and put it into my notes. So most of the time it's quotes, I

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.760
[Guest]: just lift quotes out of any book that I read, and put them in a word doc. And then I can

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.200
[Guest]: go back to them because I've got the words as they are. So mechanically, you can type

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.440
[Guest]: up a good chunk of the of the book, and keep it there. And then whenever you revisit it,

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.760
[Guest]: you can actually properly digest it. How much do you read? How many books do you read in

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.200
[Guest]: a month? This I can't say, because I never counted. But I do remember, when I did one

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.400
[Guest]: of my when I was 23, I did this BBC project called Incarnations. I was a researcher for

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:33.640
[Guest]: Sunil Khilnani. I think at that time, I'd read for that whole project about 450 books.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.080
[Guest]: Because you know, how much time? I don't know, about eight months or something like that.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.960
[Guest]: So it was, it was something. So yeah, there are there are lots of books. My next book,

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, I've already got an archive of some 400 odd books. And how do you how do you get

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.880
[Guest]: these books from like, what's the process? So you know, when I was in London, the British

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.440
[Guest]: Library is a huge archive, the School of Oriental and African Studies, they have a lot of India

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.760
[Guest]: related material, the LSE library has stuff. In India, there's, you know, the Mandarkar

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.960
[Guest]: Institute exists, there's the Gokhale Institute, a lot of it is now available online, for example,

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.280
[Guest]: Gokhale Institute's library is digitizing most of their stuff. So a lot of old books

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.600
[Guest]: in Marathi, Hindi, they're all available online. So you know, you can therefore access them

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600
[Amit Varma]: wherever you are.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.480
[Amit Varma]: But say, if you're a kid sitting in, if you're a kid sitting in Patna or Madurai or something,

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.360
[Amit Varma]: and you want to be a historian, and you'll have some kind of access to all of this.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.720
[Guest]: Yeah, I think it would be wiser than to seek an institution which would then support you

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.760
[Guest]: and give you institutional access, being part of a university or part of some sort of bigger

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.440
[Guest]: institution helps, it opens doors more easily than otherwise, because otherwise, a lot of

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.440
[Guest]: libraries, you know, they're also resource crunched. So unless you're actually you look

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.440
[Guest]: serious, they may not think that you're worth giving that sort of attention and time to

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.440
[Amit Varma]: you. Right. So, you know, one of the sort of interesting things that struck me as I

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.540
[Amit Varma]: started reading your book, and one of your early essays is called a Marathi princess

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.360
[Amit Varma]: morality play from which I, you know, took the story at the start of the episode. And

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:57.920
[Amit Varma]: just reading it, it struck me in how richly diverse not just India is, but how regions

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.680
[Amit Varma]: in India are, for example, when you talk about this 12 year old Maratha boy, who is the ruler

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.700
[Amit Varma]: of Tamil Tanjavur, you also mentioned quote, the event was emblematic of India in this

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:13.400
[Amit Varma]: bustling age with Tamil Nadu alone, attracting Afghan horsemen, Bundela Rajputs, Telugu warriors

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:19.000
[Amit Varma]: and other varieties of adventurers, stop quote, and this is kind of a theme going through

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.480
[Guest]: all your books, right? Yeah, in fact, since you mentioned this Maratha prince, what's

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.360
[Guest]: interesting is now he's a Maratha, he's Shiraji's nephew, which is, you know, it's a fairly

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.520
[Guest]: glamorous uncle to have. And he's established power in Tanjavur where the people speak Tamil.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.760
[Guest]: But what's his code language is Telugu, because the Marathas over there continue patronizing

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.760
[Guest]: Telugu, which had great prestige attached to it. So it's a it's a multicultural court,

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.720
[Guest]: you know, that existed in the 18th century. And what's even more striking is that, you

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.080
[Guest]: know, you in your introduction, you read out this bit about where this lady where the man

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.080
[Guest]: with the Brahmin says that, you know, we drink cow's milk, you eat the entire cow, so you

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.000
[Guest]: must be more pure. This is the kind of statement you can't say anymore. Imagine if a playwright

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.560
[Guest]: said that today, there'd be a lot of scandal and chaos around it, because it's insulting

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.180
[Guest]: and people are waiting to take offense and this and that. But this is Shiraji's nephew

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:07.320
[Guest]: saying it in the early 18th century, a man who was born, you know, in the late 17th century,

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.440
[Guest]: he's the one saying this. And, you know, clearly, we had more of a sense of humor then. And

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.440
[Guest]: yeah, the world was a much more diverse place. The South India was much more diverse. And

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.400
[Guest]: it wasn't surprising in South India, because it's a peninsula, peninsulas tend to have

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.480
[Guest]: people who come from various places. So the idea of a foreigner is not such a scandalous

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.640
[Guest]: concept in the south, maybe in the north, which is landlocked, these things may be different,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.440
[Guest]: but in the south, and even in the north, you know, you find all these big imperial cities,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.280
[Guest]: it's impossible, you will end up having Ottoman artillery men, you'll end up having, you know,

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.600
[Guest]: all kinds of mercenaries from all kinds of places. One of the essays in this book is

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.560
[Guest]: about Begum Samru. You know, this is a notch girl of Kashmiri descent, married first to

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.320
[Guest]: a German, then to a Frenchman in the middle, she has an affair with an Irishman. What were

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.520
[Guest]: these foreigners doing here? They were all mercenaries. They were all military men who

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.800
[Guest]: served Indian Maharajas. The Sindhiyas of Gwalior had I think a German under serving

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.280
[Guest]: under them. The Maharaja of Travanco in Kerala had a Dutch man who came and sort of modernized

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.680
[Guest]: his army. So everywhere you look, there is this sort of foreign presence. So it's not

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.720
[Guest]: just Indians moving about within the country, elite Indians, to be fair, we're not talking

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:15.080
[Guest]: about lower class or lower caste groups. This is people with access to power and mobility.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.080
[Guest]: You not only have them moving around different areas, but you also have lots of foreigners

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.800
[Guest]: coming in from overseas and becoming pretty much part of this society.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.240
[Amit Varma]: And it also seemed to me that, you know, without a constitution that protects free speech,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:33.600
[Amit Varma]: there was actually a lot of fearless parodying and, you know, satire happening. For example,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:39.800
[Amit Varma]: at one point, you talk about Nyanadev creating this buffalo that produces Vedic sounds or

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.000
[Amit Varma]: sounds that sounds like a story. Yeah, that's a story. And you and you have stuff like that

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.680
[Amit Varma]: coming out. So is it sort of a selective reading to look at all of this great satire and say

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.040
[Amit Varma]: that, hey, it was easy to kind of stand up against or is it selection bias?

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.600
[Guest]: I think Yeah, I think you can't say it was easy because it was always challenging. It

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.960
[Guest]: always took a degree of courage, especially when it came to caste. Now, you find the funny

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.840
[Guest]: thing is that, you know, there's this time in the 19th century when Jyotiba Phule says

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.920
[Guest]: that, you know, the Brahmins claim that they came out of the creator, the cosmic creator's

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.120
[Guest]: head, whereas the Shudras came from the feet and so on. So does that mean the cosmic creator

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.320
[Guest]: also menstruates from the mouth? He actually asked that in the 19th century. What's interesting

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.000
[Guest]: is that when when Kabir was there a few centuries before, he said, you know, the Brahmins claim

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.360
[Guest]: they came from they come from the head. So does that mean there was a special birth canal

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:29.160
[Guest]: through the creator's ear? You know, he said that Basava in the 12th century said something

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.040
[Guest]: very similar. And he also famously said that, you know, with the loaded with the weight

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:37.320
[Guest]: of their Vedas, the Brahmin is a veritable donkey. Now, these are things you can say,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.800
[Guest]: but you also need a degree of clout and privilege already. With Kabir, he was persecuted. Phule,

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.000
[Guest]: of course, didn't get very popular with Brahmins in Maharashtra, especially, you know, powerful

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.400
[Guest]: ones like Tilak, for example, they had more of a hold on public imagination. But there

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:55.800
[Guest]: was space for polemics, there was space to think and stand up and object. And people

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.080
[Guest]: who managed to do that when the caste system was at its most rigid and powerful, I think

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.520
[Guest]: there's something really magical that they managed to pull off. Because they said that

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.800
[Guest]: then we are now able to sit and have this conversation in a time where this is now,

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.760
[Guest]: you know, you're not supposed to say these things and so on. But we can always say, look,

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.360
[Guest]: I'm not saying it. These people said that before me. So I'm being part of a tradition

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.440
[Guest]: that is much longer, where as much as this, this Brahminical order or the caste systems exist,

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:26.280
[Guest]: there's been that much of a resistance also, throughout the last 1000 years, it's always

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.080
[Guest]: been there every now and then there's a spokesperson standing up and saying this is bad, which

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.800
[Guest]: means the challenge is always there. There was an article recently that said, you know,

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.080
[Guest]: and there's this notion that caste is a British invention. It's not true. The British in some

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.120
[Guest]: ways solidified and rigidized it some more, they sort of established in paper as though

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.440
[Guest]: this is the final version of the caste system and created their own trouble in that system.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.640
[Guest]: But that doesn't mean the caste system didn't exist before that caste existed before that.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.560
[Guest]: Some castes sometimes became richer or poorer and that sort of thing. And you could sometimes

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:59.840
[Guest]: change your Varna status, you know, like a lot of kings go from being Shudras to Kshatriyas

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.400
[Guest]: by performing certain rituals, but that doesn't make caste go away. You know, you look at

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.400
[Guest]: the corpus of Bhakti literature, it's all about standing up to caste and ritualism and,

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.440
[Guest]: and social, you know, order that's based on discrimination.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.680
[Amit Varma]: And that's, in fact, one of the great revelations of this book, how through various parts of

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:22.000
[Amit Varma]: it, you realize that long before Western modernity came to India, long before the influences

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.480
[Amit Varma]: of the Enlightenment came to India, there were free thinkers and rationalists who were

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:31.280
[Amit Varma]: challenging existing structures fairly bravely, you know, reading your book, like because

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:38.040
[Amit Varma]: there are 61 discrete chapters, 61 stories, the way I read it was, I started making notes

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.480
[Amit Varma]: with each chapter and trying to figure out which themes run across it. And two of the

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:47.000
[Amit Varma]: strong themes that sort of run through your book, which I'll probably use to as a means

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.440
[Amit Varma]: of convenience to structure this episode, are caste and gender. And I'm sure you did

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.960
[Amit Varma]: not set out looking for any of these, it's just that when you tell these stories, they

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:02.200
[Amit Varma]: are just there. And it's it's impossible not to notice their impact. And in many cases,

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:07.320
[Amit Varma]: the protagonists of the stories themselves are sort of unaware of their impact. And in

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.880
[Amit Varma]: some cases, they are manipulating it. For example, your your book begins with this story

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:19.400
[Amit Varma]: of the gentleman named Roberto Danubili. Is that the right pronunciation? Yeah, the Italian

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:27.560
[Amit Varma]: who comes to South India to convert people and quickly realizes that he has to take the

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.680
[Amit Varma]: angle of caste into consideration to become an effective converter. Tell me a little bit

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.960
[Guest]: more about it. It's quite fascinating, because this guy is born in Italy into this aristocratic,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.000
[Guest]: you know, powerful family. He's got a Holy Roman Emperor in his family tree, there's

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.400
[Guest]: a pope in his family tree, a good Catholic as it were, his parents wanted to continue

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.320
[Guest]: the line and so on. But he decides he wants to become a missionary. Now he runs away from

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:53.600
[Guest]: home becomes a priest and then eventually ends up coming to Goa, from where he comes

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.480
[Guest]: down to Madurai. Now that's a very strange location, because Madurai there's been a mission

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.740
[Guest]: set up by this much older man a few years before, but they managed to convert barely

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:06.520
[Guest]: anybody. And this man comes and realizes that one of the reasons is that now the previous

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.760
[Guest]: Jesuit who was there was eating beef. He was a parangi, a foreigner, so you know, the Brahmins

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.720
[Guest]: and the elite sort of kept a distance. Whereas this man said that I'm going to use I'm going

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.200
[Guest]: to become somewhat more Sanskritic myself. So he starts wearing the poonool or the sacred

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:24.140
[Guest]: thread or the janeo which is now you know, you had Rahul Gandhi flaunting it recently.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:29.000
[Guest]: He starts wearing the saffron robes of a sanyasi. He starts eating out of a plantain leaf rather

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.440
[Guest]: than a plate because a plate is too European, a plantain leaf is local. He starts learning

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.400
[Guest]: Telugu and Tamil and starts debating Brahmins in their own language. He starts, I mean,

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.600
[Guest]: he doesn't appreciate the Vedas, but he learns the Vedas, he tries to get a basic sense of

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.580
[Guest]: it. So he makes a lot of effort to understand what the society is, and then finally decides

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:51.720
[Guest]: to start converting Brahmins. So he converts a series of Brahmins, he converts a prince,

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.820
[Guest]: one of these local Nayaka chieftains brothers, he converts a number of high class people.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.400
[Guest]: And in his church, what he does is he again has a caste system. So the poor are all standing

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.840
[Guest]: by the door, the more, you know, upper class converts are all sitting inside and he creates

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:12.440
[Guest]: a caste system within his new sort of Tamilised Catholicism there. And the funny thing is

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:19.320
[Guest]: the influence still exists in Catholic communities in Tamil Nadu. So you know, if you go to Chennai,

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.520
[Guest]: there's that Our Lady of, not Vellankanni, there's a Virgin Mary there, but they dress

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.800
[Guest]: her up in a sari and there is a chariot festival and all of that, which essentially is a lot

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.360
[Guest]: like Hindu goddess temples and you know, their chariot processions and all of that happens.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.980
[Guest]: In Kerala also, you find that, you know, the Christians there, the old Syrian Christians

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:42.900
[Guest]: have a lot of Hindu customs that exist within their Christian everyday ritualistic practices.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.000
[Guest]: So this man does something like that. And he says that I'm going to become a Hindu to

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.440
[Guest]: save the Hindus and make them Christians. So you know, it provokes this big debate on

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:55.640
[Guest]: whether or not when you convert, you should convert completely, not just in terms of what

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.640
[Guest]: God you believe in, but in terms of your outer expression of who you are and what clothes

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:04.680
[Guest]: you wear and so on. And this continues even to the 19th century. You know, I've got other,

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.920
[Guest]: it's not in this book, but as part of my research, even in the late 19th century, you know, there

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.960
[Guest]: were converts in Maharashtra, in Tamil Nadu, in Chennai and so on, who were converting,

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.840
[Guest]: but they were still holding on to their sacred thread because they said we're converting,

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.520
[Guest]: but this is a social mark. Our sacred thread evokes the image of our original caste position

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.880
[Guest]: as Brahmins. So, you know, they didn't see any reason why converting to Christianity

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.880
[Guest]: would cause them to give up their Poonul. But you know, such as that, that was what

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.920
[Guest]: this Roberto started off and ended up, you know, he was this Italian Brahmin pretending

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:38.040
[Guest]: that the Bible was this lost Veda and he was part of this Brahminical tradition himself.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.240
[Guest]: And to a great extent, he succeeded because by the end of his career, there were about

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.440
[Guest]: 4,000-5,000 converts that he had managed to make where earlier there were only a few dozens.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.000
[Guest]: And he was thrown into prison. He did have some difficulties, but he somehow managed

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.280
[Guest]: to push through and he also got the Pope at the time to acknowledge and support his methods.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.440
[Guest]: Of course, by the next century after his death, another Pope revoked that permission and these

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:05.560
[Guest]: Malabar rites, as they were called, were banned, but it left its impact. You know, even now

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.480
[Guest]: the right-wing hates him because they think he came here as some sort of sinister agent

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:14.360
[Guest]: with the desire to sort of penetrate society and, you know, convert people like that. Of

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.240
[Guest]: course, that's what he did. But I don't think he came here with such grand plans. It's just

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.920
[Guest]: that he decided that he was going to live here and die here. So he might as well become

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.760
[Amit Varma]: Indian in many ways. In fact, while reading it, I thought that the right-wing today should

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.600
[Amit Varma]: love him because he, you know, he spoke about how the Bible was a lost Veda, which kind

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.280
[Amit Varma]: of reminded me of what the right-wing says about, you know, Christianity originating

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:38.120
[Amit Varma]: as Krishna Niti and all of that. And one of the sort of meta themes that also seems to

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:43.920
[Amit Varma]: run through your book is narrative manipulation. For example, here, he's figuring out that

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:49.280
[Amit Varma]: he's got to use a caste as a tactic and sort of, and therefore he creates this narrative

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.120
[Amit Varma]: where Christianity kind of fits into that. And throughout the book, you have characters

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.840
[Amit Varma]: who are recasting themselves. Of course, one constant form of narrative manipulation is

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:04.080
[Amit Varma]: what is done to women, how they are recast into sort of more conventional and acceptable

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.520
[Amit Varma]: avatars, as it were. And, you know, you have Shivaji recasting himself through the thing

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:14.320
[Amit Varma]: you have, you know, all the different narratives around Kabir's birth, where he's born a Hindu,

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.560
[Guest]: born a Muslim. And nobody's quite, I mean, everyone wants to claim him. Everyone wants

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:24.200
[Amit Varma]: to claim him. Getting back to caste, another fascinating chapter was called a Dalit at

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:31.360
[Amit Varma]: the temple door, which is about a gentleman named Chokmila in Pandharpur, who is a bhakti

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:38.400
[Amit Varma]: saint, basically. The first mahar, the first male mahar bhakti saint. Yeah. And you quote

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:43.560
[Amit Varma]: him at one point as, you know, complaining to the Brahmin gatekeepers of the temple where

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:48.760
[Amit Varma]: he isn't allowed in. And he says, the cane is crooked, but its juice isn't crooked. Chokha

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:55.000
[Amit Varma]: is ugly, but his feelings aren't ugly. Why be fooled by outward appearance? Tell me a

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.600
[Amit Varma]: little bit about Chokmila and how he sort of became one of the big bhakti saints. Yeah,

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.080
[Guest]: he and what's interesting is that he doesn't quite challenge the status quo in the way

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.520
[Guest]: say Atukaram does or, you know, some of the other bhakti saints do, because at the end

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.440
[Guest]: of the day, they still had relative social position and privilege. So, you know, even

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:19.200
[Guest]: Atukaram, even though he was, you know, from his family were grocers and they were shudras,

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.000
[Guest]: but they were not atishudras, as Phule would put it later. They were not absolute Dalits.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.880
[Guest]: A mahar means he's a menial worker. That's his job, you know, dragging away dead cows

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.560
[Guest]: and their carcasses and things like that. And one of his stories, it's funny, you know,

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.720
[Guest]: God appears to lend him a hand to drag away this dead cow. So he therefore doesn't have

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.280
[Guest]: the privilege to quite say things that are too direct and too blunt, because his position

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.600
[Guest]: is already very weak. So anything he says he can be knocked off quite easily as opposed

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.300
[Guest]: to others with some protection. So as a result of that, there's a little bit of fatalism

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.100
[Guest]: in his message, which is that, oh, you know, this is, I must be born in this position because

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:57.440
[Guest]: of my past karma, and things like that. His son, Karmamela is not so forgiving. Karmamela

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.440
[Guest]: is much more direct saying, you know, what kind of God are you, if this is the fate you've

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:07.200
[Guest]: sort of, you know, compared us or forced us into. Whereas Chokamela is a little more accepting.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.640
[Guest]: He believes that in his past life, he's done something wrong. That's why this is happening.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.200
[Guest]: But at the end of the day, the closest he can get to his God is to the temple door.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.040
[Guest]: He's not allowed anywhere beyond that. And the story is that, you know, he was finally

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.200
[Guest]: asked to go and do some work and there was an accident there and he was buried alive.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.240
[Guest]: And he pulled his body out and even his bones were chanting God's name. That's the story.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.400
[Guest]: So they finally got his remains and buried it. They said, you can't bury it inside the

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.840
[Guest]: temple because it's impure. So we'll bury it at the door. And that's why even today

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.520
[Guest]: there is a shrine to Chokamela. The funny thing is, by the 18th century, this is where

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.400
[Guest]: Dalits used to gather and, you know, worship the deity. And that's when the Peshwas say,

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.000
[Guest]: no, no, you can't stand near the entrance because all the Brahmins going in, you know,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.240
[Guest]: your sweat and your bodies are touching them. So it's impure. So you guys have got to move

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.640
[Guest]: from here. So, you know, the end of the day, Chokamela, all his life, all he wanted was

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.480
[Guest]: a glimpse of the deity inside. And although the deity often came out and met him in miraculous

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.720
[Guest]: situations, sometimes sitting with him, sometimes, you know, helping him with his work and so

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.720
[Guest]: on. Even the deity doesn't tell him, OK, break the law, you know, enter the temple, let's

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.560
[Guest]: see what happens. Because at the end of the day, you know, I think Chokamela was a little

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.960
[Guest]: paranoid about making anything, taking a step that was too dramatic. Because, you know,

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:20.800
[Guest]: this is what caste does. You assume that it was some sort of flexible system and so on.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.240
[Guest]: It wasn't. He didn't have the privilege. He couldn't have said what he wanted to say.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.520
[Guest]: As I said, Abbaswana earlier could in the 12th century say, call a Brahmin a veritable

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.540
[Guest]: donkey loaded with his Vedas because he was a Brahmin himself. He was born a Brahmin.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.720
[Guest]: So he could get away with saying it because he was protected by that much privilege. Chokamela

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.080
[Guest]: never could say something like that because he would probably have been lynched. So some

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:46.880
[Amit Varma]: things in this country obviously never change. Never change. And what happened to Chokamela's

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.600
[Guest]: son? Is he remembered? Not very much. Because the thing is, because his message has a little

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.880
[Guest]: more punch, he isn't sung that much during these Varkari processions and so on. He's

00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.040
[Guest]: not a very major figure. So it's Chokamela on the other hand people like because he doesn't,

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:04.840
[Guest]: you know, his devotion overtakes any hint of radicalism that may have been there. There

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.400
[Guest]: are occasional times, like the quote that you read out, there are occasional times where

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.560
[Guest]: Chokamela seems to question the social order. But broadly, he's, you know, not going to

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:18.640
[Guest]: push too hard. So he's a little more popular because the powers that be could come to terms

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:24.760
[Guest]: with him. But his son is a little too blunt. So his son is slightly less, let's say recalled.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:30.360
[Amit Varma]: So like you said, Basava being a Brahmin himself, could then, you know, say things like quote

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.920
[Amit Varma]: false, utterly false are the stories of divine birth, the higher type of man is a man who

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:40.240
[Amit Varma]: knows himself, stop quote. And at another point, he says, quote, on the same earth stands

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:45.000
[Amit Varma]: the outcasts Havel and the deity's temple, whether for ritual or rinsing, is not the

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.920
[Amit Varma]: water same, stop quote. And like you said, it's it's purely because of his Brahmin birth

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.760
[Amit Varma]: that he could do this. I mean, otherwise, you know, he would have been lynched. Yeah.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.280
[Guest]: And his people also, they were finally attacked. And they had to sort of flee when they arranged

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.520
[Guest]: an intercaste marriage where they got a Brahmin's daughter married to an untouchable son. That

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.840
[Guest]: is not only intercaste, it's I mean, if it was a man marrying an untouchable woman, I

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.280
[Guest]: suppose some people would have still swallowed it. But a Brahmin woman might be given to

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.320
[Guest]: an untouchable man. This is in the 12th century. Imagine, you know, even today in this country,

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.080
[Guest]: there was a news report a few days ago for 17 or 18 year old boy killing his 21 year

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.480
[Guest]: old sister, shooting her in the head or something because she'd married someone below caste.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.200
[Guest]: And that's happening now in 2019. And in Basavastan, in the 12th century also, when a Brahmin woman

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:31.760
[Guest]: married an untouchable, this was the kind of reaction, his entire community was uprooted

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.880
[Guest]: and there was violence and a massacre and they all had to run away and he died the next

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:40.080
[Guest]: year. And they had to essentially live underground and be very quiet and unobtrusive for many

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.920
[Guest]: centuries before the Lingayats could again start asserting their identity. So even when

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:50.160
[Guest]: he finally transgressed that, that marriage aspect or the mingling of castes, interdining,

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.360
[Guest]: all of that, there were repercussions. But he could say a lot more, his message could

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:59.080
[Guest]: be a little more powerful because he was, he was a minister in a local ruler's court.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.320
[Guest]: So he had that, how did he become a minister because he was a Brahmin, because he had access

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:08.040
[Guest]: to education. So he was protected by a lot of social privilege, which gave him more of

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.760
[Guest]: more space to really articulate more radical thoughts. But others didn't always have that

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:16.840
[Amit Varma]: space. Yeah. And there's a lovely, I mean, your book is of course full of lovely sentences

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:23.480
[Amit Varma]: because, you know, there's such a entertaining sense of, there's such wit that you bring

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.400
[Amit Varma]: to your writing. So I'll read the sentence out about what happened to the parents of

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:31.600
[Amit Varma]: the inter-caste couple who got married. Quote, the monarch and the establishment were apoplectic.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:36.120
[Amit Varma]: The respective fathers, it is said, had their eyes gouged out, after which they were thrown

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:42.160
[Amit Varma]: under elephants to painfully meet their maker, casteless in death. Stop quote. And this is

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.040
[Amit Varma]: a common theme through the Middle Ages, that people getting thrown under elephants.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.720
[Guest]: I think it was some sort of favourite theme. Even in the early 19th century, when I was

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.200
[Guest]: doing my research on my first book, there's a celebrated figure in Kerala history called

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:58.200
[Guest]: Veluthambi Dalava. He's the man who stood up to the British in 1809. And what's interesting

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.000
[Guest]: is one of his favourite formats of punishment for rebels and people who were criminals,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.880
[Guest]: etc, was to tie one leg to one elephant, the other to another elephant and then drive them

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:10.480
[Guest]: in opposite directions. So the person will be torn to bits by these two elephants. So

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.120
[Guest]: the elephants, yeah, they were clearly a very popular form. And also gouging the eyes out.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.840
[Guest]: It's also common, especially among the Mughals, that if you want to get rid of a rival, you

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.600
[Guest]: don't have to kill him, just blind him. Because under Islamic law, blinding makes you ineligible

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.800
[Guest]: to rule. So you know, if you don't want to kill your brother, which is also an option,

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.200
[Guest]: by the way, you can always kill everybody. But if you don't, then you can simply blind

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:36.120
[Amit Varma]: them and feel a little less guilty. Yeah, it's more empathetic to blind your enemies.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:41.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, another quote from Basava, which I kind of like, which again, is about conservative

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:47.680
[Amit Varma]: Brahminical hypocrisy, as you put it. And the quote is, they say pour, pour the milk

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:52.160
[Amit Varma]: when they see a snake image in stone, but they cry kill, kill when they meet a snake

00:30:52.160 --> 00:31:00.760
[Amit Varma]: for real. Stop quote. And Basava was also very enlightened in terms of, for example,

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.920
[Amit Varma]: gender, like you also write about, you know, if you want to test the sincerity of those

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.080
[Amit Varma]: who are trying to bring about reform, that is again, one of the litmus tests by which

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:13.720
[Amit Varma]: you can judge them, like what have they done for gender and out of the 200 saints associated

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:19.600
[Amit Varma]: with him as many as 35 were female, 14 of them unmarried, one of them naked, you know,

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.800
[Guest]: one of them naked. Yeah. So you know, she didn't she didn't wear clothes. And she was

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.920
[Guest]: originally married to a royal person and she eventually walks out of there. And this is

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.560
[Guest]: the man who gives her refuge when her nakedness becomes a matter of controversy within the

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.320
[Guest]: group. He's the one who rises to defend her. Similarly, you know, this is the funny thing.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:39.000
[Guest]: There are lots of reformers who are anti caste, but the basic caste system around the world

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.840
[Guest]: has been between men and women. There's always that caste system, which are which fewer people

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.400
[Guest]: are willing to take on. So Basava has this had this interesting thing where usually even

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:53.000
[Guest]: in the more enlightened communities or liberated communities or whatever, menstruating women

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.520
[Guest]: were still considered impure. But for Linga, it's all Basava, as per his philosophy, there's

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.960
[Guest]: nothing impure about it. menstruation is a perfectly natural function. That's what it

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:05.880
[Guest]: is. You can still hold your Ishta Linga, which is their totem, which is a portable Shiva

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.440
[Guest]: Linga. And that was that was the only thing they don't go to temples, their dead are buried,

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:15.200
[Guest]: very different customs. But you know, menstruating women were not sin women had an almost equal

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.760
[Guest]: position within his own order. Although in terms of numbers, they were not an equal half.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:25.640
[Guest]: 35 out of a little over 200 is a fairly large number. If you look at the other, you know,

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.000
[Guest]: saints etc. And how many women they had around them, even Kabir sometimes could say very

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.440
[Guest]: sexist things, you know, calling women sin and things like that. Of course, the thing

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.000
[Guest]: with saints is they also say very contradictory things. So in one poem, they'll say sin the

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.320
[Guest]: other poem, they'll say something else. So this often happens. So the context is important

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.160
[Guest]: in which something is being said. But Basava was unusual for this reason also that women

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.640
[Guest]: to him in that caste system also he wanted to smash it was and that may perhaps explain

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.400
[Guest]: why he was getting a Brahmin's daughter married to an untouchable son, because it was several

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.640
[Guest]: things that he was trying to shift and change at the same time. And in some regards, perhaps

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:01.200
[Guest]: he was trying to do too much too quickly, because then obviously the the backlash is

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:08.200
[Amit Varma]: also very intense. And there's also a very interesting sort of interesting theme of gender

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.920
[Amit Varma]: fluidity, which comes out like one of his vachanas goes, look here, dear fellow, I wear

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:17.720
[Amit Varma]: these men's clothes only for you. Sometimes I am man, sometimes I am woman, stop quote,

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.520
[Guest]: which given the times is pretty quite a lot of bhakti, actually bhakti literature, it's

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:27.600
[Guest]: often even men, they often take female voices. So you know, Shetra, yeah, who's this big

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.840
[Guest]: bhakti poet, a lot of Telugu work, you often have God presented as a customer on his way

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.160
[Guest]: to his favorite courtesan. And you have poems where the courtesan turns around saying, why

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.880
[Guest]: have you come to my door? I saw you at that other Radha's door the other day, you know,

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:44.400
[Guest]: go back to her and things like that. So the voice is often of this woman who's a little

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:50.280
[Guest]: annoyed with God. Otherwise, it's a love loan, you know, viraha sort of expression where

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.680
[Guest]: she's pining for her beloved and the man, you know, essentially feminizes his voice,

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:58.960
[Guest]: because God is a masculine, he is the one who's missing God. But here again, you have

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.920
[Guest]: the naked saint Mahadevi, you know, she says that, you know, while Basava says that she

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:07.120
[Guest]: says, no, I'm masculine. No, she identifies with the masculine, she sees herself as the

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.440
[Guest]: masculine principle and so on. So yeah, it's, it's interesting how much fluidity in that

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:17.600
[Guest]: sense there was, at least in terms of articulating your thought, there was no gender didn't stand

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.080
[Guest]: in the way you could easily switch voices, depending on what was comfortable for your

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.120
[Amit Varma]: sense of expression. And the Lingayats when they formed seem to be something that was

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:30.520
[Amit Varma]: kind of outside caste rebellion against an orthodox Hinduism, but eventually they sort

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.640
[Amit Varma]: of got assimilated into the mainstream and are now considered just another caste. Yeah,

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.120
[Guest]: I mean, they want to break out of the Hindu fold. There was that whole thing a couple

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.240
[Guest]: of years ago. But you know, the thing the way caste functions is that this is what it

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.240
[Guest]: does. You know, initially, even rebels are eventually made to fit into the system, caste

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.240
[Guest]: doesn't break, caste just absorbs them into a new caste. You see this among Kerala Christians

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:55.040
[Guest]: also, technically, Christianity is not supposed to have caste. But there is a sense of aristocracy

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.180
[Guest]: among the old Syrian Christian families were seen as higher caste Christians. And you know,

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.840
[Guest]: you need them to come and touch the oil and ghee that goes into a temple only then is

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.560
[Guest]: it purified. In my own ancestral house, every time the ghee etc came from the market, it

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.920
[Guest]: was kept outside the kitchen building, a Christian had to be found to touch it to purify it before

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.840
[Guest]: it came inside. And it had to be a Syrian Christian, it couldn't be a low caste convert,

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:18.640
[Guest]: it couldn't be from the LMS or the CMS or one of the later missionary societies. It

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:22.840
[Guest]: couldn't be, you know, anybody else except a Syrian Christian who was considered the

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:27.240
[Guest]: most superior kind of Christian. And within them, they had these these systems in markets

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.880
[Guest]: for everything. So I guess there's a market there for Syrian Christians. Did they actually

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.960
[Guest]: dip their finger in the ghee? No, I think I'm not entirely sure because nobody now remembers

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.080
[Amit Varma]: whether there was a dipping or not. But you're supposed to touch the container at least.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.560
[Amit Varma]: And it's very interesting. You know, a little earlier, you were chatting about the common

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:50.040
[Amit Varma]: notion that the British created or at least solidified the caste system. But through your

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:55.920
[Amit Varma]: book, there are also indications on how colonialism may have been something that helped fight

00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:01.160
[Amit Varma]: the caste system. For example, you write about, you have a great chapter about what if the

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:06.440
[Amit Varma]: British Raj had never been there. And there you point out, quote, ironically, it was British

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:11.600
[Amit Varma]: rule that allowed low caste voices to emerge at last. It was a missionary education and

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:17.040
[Amit Varma]: access to Western texts, for instance, that galvanized Jyotiba Phule in his program of

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:23.200
[Amit Varma]: reform. And a little later in the context of Macaulay, you say, quote, nativists resented

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.120
[Amit Varma]: Macaulay, but there were others who embraced this policy. After all, the likes of Jyotirao

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.800
[Amit Varma]: Phule, son of a gardener, could never enter Sanskrit schools, but were welcome in English

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.440
[Amit Varma]: institutions. They felt no shame in being painted Macaulay putras when the alternative

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.840
[Amit Varma]: was demeaning drudgery in service of the upper caste, who only appeared less haughty than

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.400
[Amit Varma]: Englishmen because they were brown and looked more familiar. Yeah, in fact, this reminds

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:49.360
[Guest]: me of the opening section of Zareer Masani's book on Macaulay. It's a biography. And apparently

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.840
[Guest]: even now there are communities of Dalits who celebrate Macaulay's birthday as some sort

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.080
[Guest]: of Jayanti. Because for them, Macaulay is a little bit of a liberator. He's a man who

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.760
[Guest]: finally gives them access to the English language. And Jyotirao Phule, you know, this is a man

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.640
[Guest]: who dedicates one of his books, Gulamgiri, to the people of the United States. He reads

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.320
[Guest]: Thomas Paine's writer, Rights of Man, because that's what inspires him. And he reads it

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:14.280
[Guest]: in English. And he's very acutely aware that in the old schools, he has no place. He's

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:20.880
[Guest]: made to feel like a Mali Greengrocer's son. That's what his caste is. And, you know, his

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:25.600
[Guest]: grandfather was a gardener, his father was a greengrocer. So he's made to feel that.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.280
[Guest]: But then English liberates him. This is again why Ambedkar wore a suit because it was easy

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.040
[Guest]: for Gandhi to renounce the suit and dress in khadi and all of that because he had the

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:38.020
[Guest]: privilege. For an Ambedkar, wearing that suit was a sense of identity, was a sense of look.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:42.280
[Guest]: My ancestors couldn't wear what they wanted. They were only allowed a loincloth. You, Gandhiji,

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.920
[Guest]: can now discard the suit for the loincloth because he can. My ancestors could only wear

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.200
[Guest]: the loincloth. So now we're going to wear suits. Now we're going to hold those bags.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.080
[Guest]: Mayawati is going to hold her little leather purse because it's a larger principle that

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:59.400
[Guest]: they're trying to project. So yeah, a lot of this British thing, one of the complications

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:04.320
[Guest]: in this whole British equal to bad, Indians equal to good, is that lower caste Indians

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.480
[Guest]: did find British rule fairly generous towards them. It created spaces for them, it created

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:14.200
[Guest]: at least officially, it created a legal system where they could get their grievances addressed.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:18.120
[Guest]: A lot of times, you know, a lot of Indian castes would not work in the British army,

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.880
[Guest]: but a lot of Dalit castes would. So, you know, they contributed that way. You know, there's

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.240
[Guest]: that famous incident of the battle outside Pune, where, you know, the Mahars even now

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.420
[Guest]: celebrate it as a good thing because that's where the British won over the Peshwas people.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.920
[Guest]: And they see it as a good thing because for them, the Peshwas are Brahmins. The Peshwas

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.040
[Guest]: are the ones who insist Mahars should walk around with a broom tied to their waist and

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.280
[Guest]: a pot around their neck so that the spit falls into the pot and the broom wipes off their

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.680
[Guest]: footsteps and things like that. And these are people, they supported the British and

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:49.360
[Guest]: they defeated the Peshwas people. So for them, that's a mark of identity. It's a mark of

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.360
[Guest]: self-respect.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:55.260
[Amit Varma]: And just thinking aloud then, is that one of the reasons that many traditionalists look

00:38:55.260 --> 00:39:02.040
[Amit Varma]: suspiciously at Western modernity and so on, because in a sense, it might bring economic

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.680
[Amit Varma]: progress, but it threatens their social standing as well.

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:09.080
[Guest]: Yeah. So, you know, Periyar has said it, Ambedkar said it, which is that this whole, I mean,

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.760
[Guest]: I'm not agreeing with what they said fully, but their argument was that the whole nationalistic

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:16.720
[Guest]: movement was about Indian elites wanting to take over from British rulers. So they just

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.160
[Guest]: wanted to slip into the seat that the British had kept warm for them. But they don't want

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.520
[Guest]: to reform anything within the system. They didn't want social upheaval. Gandhi definitely

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:29.120
[Guest]: didn't want any social upheaval. He wanted peace socially, agitation politically. So

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.040
[Guest]: whereas the low caste leaders all said, you can never have full freedom if you're not

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:37.600
[Guest]: willing to uproot an unjust social order. But unfortunately, you know, that sort of

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.280
[Guest]: message is never romantic. And Ambedkar, at the end of the day, you need to be really

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.160
[Guest]: serious to understand his message. He was perhaps the most towering intellectual of

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.880
[Guest]: his generation, far superior to Gandhi and Nehru. But the thing is, his message can't

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.840
[Guest]: be romanticized. It can't be turned into this grand narrative that people find appealing.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:59.200
[Guest]: It's a very serious affair. And because of that, the kind of attraction it has for large

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:04.120
[Guest]: masses is lower, because only a certain type of person would prefer that over this grand

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:08.120
[Guest]: notion of the Indian nation and the romance of nationalism and all of that. But the romance

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.800
[Guest]: of nationalism conceals a lot of social injustice. It conceals a lot of let's preserve the status

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.400
[Guest]: quo. And that is what the low caste leaders stood up to. Ambedkar, even on the eve of

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:21.720
[Guest]: independence say about seven years before 1940s, early 40s, was saying things like the

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:26.440
[Guest]: British don't distinguish between the departure of one tyrant and the right of another tyrant

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.440
[Guest]: to start oppressing the people below them. So there's, you know, that sort of messaging

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.800
[Guest]: in that as well, which is why even now, at the end of the day, Dalit agitation is particularly

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:41.560
[Guest]: scary for majoritarian groups, because for them that creates or that highlights and holds

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:46.680
[Guest]: up a mirror to divisions within, which they'd rather avoid and create a pan-Indian Hindu

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.840
[Guest]: identity. But the point is, you know, when you say Hindu, that includes so many categories,

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.040
[Guest]: and you're not willing to completely give up your sense of privilege within.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:59.240
[Amit Varma]: No, I actually agree with Ambedkar and Piyar on this. And even outside the context of caste,

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:04.480
[Amit Varma]: I would hold that it is true that what we did in 1947 was replaced a set of colonial

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:09.080
[Amit Varma]: rulers with a set of brown skin rulers. And this is true in context, well beyond caste.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:14.840
[Amit Varma]: And I sort of, you know, I had Ram Guha on my show a few months ago, talking about Gandhi,

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.920
[Amit Varma]: we had a couple of episodes on this. And in the second of those, which I'll link from

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:24.040
[Amit Varma]: the show notes, we spoke about the whole Ambedkar versus Gandhi debates. And I just there feel

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:28.440
[Amit Varma]: strongly on the side of Ambedkar, because I think while Gandhi paid lip service to caste

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:34.920
[Amit Varma]: upliftment, he also said things like this sentence, which you quote in your book, a

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:40.320
[Amit Varma]: bhangi does for society what a mother does for a baby. And you speak about how Gandhi,

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.560
[Amit Varma]: who was so patronizing on this subject, used to talk about the beauty of compromise and

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:51.520
[Amit Varma]: social dynamics between the low who had answers to seek, and the high who had so much to lose.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:56.840
[Amit Varma]: These are your words. And, you know, and let's talk about Periyar a bit because the chapter

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.600
[Amit Varma]: was very fascinating. And it made me I haven't read enough about Periyar, you know, so I

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.840
[Amit Varma]: instantly skipped to the notes and I to figure out what books I should read. And there's

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.200
[Amit Varma]: another great quote by Periyar on this where he says, if you have to choose between killing

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:16.480
[Amit Varma]: a Brahmin or a snake, spare the snake. And Periyar was the anti-Gandhi in ways other

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:21.040
[Amit Varma]: than just caste. And I found him to be a really fascinating character. Tell me a bit about

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:25.680
[Guest]: him. He was, you know, he could be very polemical. Obviously, you know, this is a man who smashed

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:30.520
[Guest]: idols, he used to garland, you know, images of Rama and all with chappals. That was the

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:34.400
[Guest]: kind of thing he did. Again, if Periyar lived 50 years later, he'd probably be lynched,

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:39.240
[Guest]: but he was an atheist. So when Gandhi renounced sex in his 30s, Periyar got married to a 30

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.960
[Guest]: year old in his 70s. Gandhi wore white, Periyar wore black. Gandhi said, you know, Ram Raja

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.600
[Guest]: and things like that. Periyar said no atheism. And when and most importantly, you know, Gandhiji

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:52.840
[Guest]: was all about preserving family and, you know, women in their position. He was a little conservative

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.840
[Guest]: in that regard. Whereas Periyar always said women don't look to men to liberate you because

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.720
[Guest]: of you know, when is when have men ever liberated women just like you can't expect a fox or

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.240
[Amit Varma]: something. I'll read the quote out. You've got it in your book, which is have cats ever

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:11.160
[Amit Varma]: feed rats? Have foxes ever liberated goats or chickens? Have whites ever enriched Indians?

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.760
[Amit Varma]: Have Brahmins ever given non Brahmins justice? We can be confident that women will never

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:20.360
[Guest]: be emancipated by men. Yeah, so you know, the thing is, he's polemical, but the things

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.760
[Guest]: you need people like that, it's a little bit like, you know, if you read Arundhati Roy

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.440
[Guest]: today, you don't have to agree with everything she does. But she does a service in the broader

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:32.400
[Guest]: sense, which is that by holding up these very uncomfortable positions by using her influence

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.400
[Guest]: to say certain things, which are not always agreeable, but it holds up a mirror, it makes

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.840
[Guest]: us acknowledge that we've got ugly sides to us that we have to recognize and acknowledge.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.160
[Guest]: This is to some extent, that's why I find Periyar fascinating, not because you agree

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.080
[Guest]: with everything he says, but because he asks a lot of uncomfortable questions. At a time

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.280
[Guest]: when it was very easy to blame the British saying you are the villains, and we are these

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:55.760
[Guest]: victims and we must all rally together. He kept saying hold on, you're not all victims,

00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:00.240
[Guest]: you know, some of you are, you know, privileged, some of you are pretty much in the in, you

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.960
[Guest]: know, in the in cahoots with the British. There are other people who are the real victims

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:07.960
[Guest]: here and you're not even acknowledging that. So asking awkward questions really fascinates

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.360
[Guest]: me because this is a time when the whole momentum is with Gandhiji, the whole momentum is, you

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:15.680
[Guest]: know, with the freedom struggle and all that. And here's a man essentially being a little

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.640
[Guest]: bit of a party pooper. But it was important that he did it at that time. Because for a

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.720
[Guest]: lot of people, you know, that clarified thought that makes us realize that, you know, the

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.400
[Guest]: battle is only half won. Throwing out the British is only one part of the beginning

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:32.680
[Guest]: of a much larger battle. And we haven't won those larger battles even today. And you know,

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:37.360
[Guest]: to that extent, Periyar has value. So even though he's polemical and a little too, you

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:41.840
[Guest]: know, he can be a rabble rouser even in certain contexts. And I wouldn't say, you know, you

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:46.360
[Guest]: should go around putting chapals on people's idols. His right to do it is his right. But

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:50.160
[Guest]: you know, that's sort of, it's a little too blunt. And there was a lot of victimization

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:55.400
[Guest]: of Brahmins as a result of that, which is also not entirely healthy. But as I said,

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:59.320
[Guest]: opening up a mirror is not always easy. So for having done that, he deserves a certain

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:04.680
[Guest]: amount of interest and acknowledgement. And in fact, speaking of books, you know, Venkatesh

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.120
[Guest]: Jalapathy has been working for years and years and years on Periyar and everyone's waiting

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:13.280
[Guest]: for that book to come out. Because he's, I think, the foremost Periyar scholar. And once

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:18.320
[Guest]: he finishes his book, I think we'll have a really good solid volume on Periyar.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.760
[Amit Varma]: And reading it, I was just thinking, you know, looking back at what happened to guys like

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:26.520
[Amit Varma]: Dabholkar and Pansri. And I was just thinking that, you know, Periyar would be in a bit

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.920
[Amit Varma]: of actual trouble today. Like there's this great quote with which you start the book,

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:36.320
[Amit Varma]: with which I fully agree. Quote, there is no God, there is no God at all. He who created

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:42.280
[Amit Varma]: God is a fool. He who propagates God is a scoundrel. He who worships God is a barbarian.

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.160
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote. And you know, the fact that he could actually say this. He started every

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:51.920
[Guest]: public meeting saying that. Gandhiji starting with bhajans and things like that. This is

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:56.080
[Guest]: what Periyar started his public meetings with. So imagine, you know, these two towering figures

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.880
[Guest]: of the time, they're essentially, you know, pretty much contemporaries. And you have one

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.800
[Guest]: Gandhi in the North and one anti-Gandhi in the South. And you see in the South, that's

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.720
[Guest]: why even today, if you look at the South, in the South, the freedom struggle was not

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:12.240
[Guest]: so anti-British. It was also anti-caste, it was for social reform and so on. Whether it's

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.520
[Guest]: Kerala, Tamil Nadu, these were also part of that struggle. It wasn't merely about pushing

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:21.120
[Guest]: the British out, which you can see that the reflections of that in South Indian society

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:25.000
[Guest]: even today, you know, women are better off. You know, the caste system exists, there is

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.040
[Guest]: still caste violence and so on. But it's not as intense as parts of Northern India, because

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.080
[Amit Varma]: these issues were not completely neglected in the South. So how central was Periyar to

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.480
[Amit Varma]: this? Because like you said, the South is a peninsula, so it would automatically therefore

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.040
[Guest]: because of those in. The thing is, Periyar, I think at some level was handicapped by language,

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:44.960
[Guest]: which is that Tamil was his main medium of disseminating his message. So his influence

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:48.400
[Guest]: was largely in that area. But he did come to Kerala, he's the one who, you know, took

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:53.000
[Guest]: a proactive role in the Vaikam Satyagraha that ended up throwing open roads around temples

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.240
[Guest]: to Dalits. So he did come like that, but and famously said that when the Maharaja of Travancore

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:02.640
[Guest]: refused to allow it, he said, these roads are not the Maharaja's grandfather's property.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.520
[Guest]: And this is Kerala at that time, the Maharaja of Travancore is the semi-divine figure, nobody

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:10.280
[Guest]: says anything against him. And Periyar comes and says something like that in a place like

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:15.040
[Guest]: Kerala, which is, which was called by Vivekananda, lunatic asylum of caste, because it's so rigid

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:20.040
[Guest]: and so orthodox. So it's some influence elsewhere, but I think broadly in the Tamil space.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.920
[Amit Varma]: So for Amits like me, who may not be very aware, tell me a little bit more about his

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.560
[Amit Varma]: influence in Tamil culture and Tamil politics.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:32.600
[Guest]: One is this whole rationalist influence, which is that, you know, this anti-Brahminical Hinduism,

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:36.240
[Guest]: it wasn't and you know, the highlighting of Dravidian culture, etc. Now the funny thing

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:40.040
[Guest]: is there again, missionaries have a role. They're the ones who first promoted this Dravidian

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:45.280
[Guest]: identity as very separate notion. And that was picked up into a political concept by

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.720
[Guest]: people like Periyar, where there was a sense of identity and they didn't see why it had

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:53.360
[Guest]: to merge with or become subsumed by Hindi nationalism or Hindu nationalism or anything.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.560
[Guest]: They were proud to be Tamils. They were not very interested in some of these other messages

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:03.200
[Guest]: coming from further up north. Then, as I said, his rationalism is very interesting. It obviously

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.120
[Guest]: hasn't lasted in the sense that, you know, people are still devout in temples, etc. still

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.400
[Guest]: important. But if you look at all the Tamil political parties, whether it's a DMK or the

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:16.440
[Guest]: AIDMK, you know, they always pay lip service to this one man because his influence over

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.280
[Guest]: local society is so vast that you have to, he's essentially the local Gandhi, you know,

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.280
[Amit Varma]: you can't...

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.200
[Amit Varma]: Do they pay lip service to him because he's like a Tamil icon or do they pay lip service

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.640
[Guest]: to him because of his ideas per se?

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:29.520
[Guest]: I think icon, it's a little bit like Gandhiji, you know, like his ideas, the moment he died,

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.600
[Guest]: all the ideas were put away in a basket and framed and put up in museums.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.040
[Amit Varma]: And many of them were quite dubious as well.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.800
[Guest]: Yeah, they were pretty dubious. And, you know, I have this essay saying, what if Gandhi had

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.840
[Guest]: lived? And the whole point is that if he had actually lived, he would have become a headache

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.800
[Guest]: for Nehru, most likely. And all the other people in power, because suddenly you're in

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.840
[Guest]: power. It's very easy to say things when you're not in power. But once you're, you know, you

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.560
[Guest]: can have romantic notions of the nation, freedom and all of that when you're not in power.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.520
[Guest]: When you're in power, there's something called a budget, there's the economy, there are social

00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:00.160
[Guest]: rival competing claims that need to be balanced. There's industrialists on one side, labor

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.720
[Guest]: on the other side, which means there's going to be compromise. At that time, a Gandhiji

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.760
[Guest]: with his pious principles sitting above this whole edifice, you know, saying things would

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.680
[Guest]: have been an inconvenience, I suspect, for Nehru. So, you know, it's a little bit like

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.360
[Guest]: that where Periyar also, some of the things he did, they would never repeat today, it

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:19.240
[Guest]: would be impossible. But, you know, you pay lip service, you always say that he's a great

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.600
[Guest]: Tamil icon. And therefore, for that reason, give Periyar a certain amount of respect.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.160
[Amit Varma]: I was reading the chapter on him with great jealousy, because you cite the title of one

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:32.640
[Amit Varma]: of his op-eds, which is honeymoon in the Hindu zoo. And I, you know, I write a column for

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:37.600
[Amit Varma]: the Times of India. And man, if I suggested that as a headline, there is no way to pass.

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:43.520
[Amit Varma]: Today, it simply wouldn't fly from this very serious subject of caste. And while staying

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.920
[Amit Varma]: on the serious subject of caste, let's also go to some blood and violence. You've got

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:52.600
[Guest]: this great chapter, which I was actually half afraid that now, by this time in the conversation,

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:57.600
[Amit Varma]: people would assume the entire book is only about caste, which it isn't at all. It's just

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.880
[Amit Varma]: one of the themes that I picked up on, but it's quite incidental. It's, it's, there's

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:07.720
[Amit Varma]: nothing sort of polemical in your, your stories are basically bloodshed and violence, when

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:12.680
[Amit Varma]: I say that in a good way. So there's this great chapter you have called the bloody monsoon

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:18.560
[Amit Varma]: of Vellore. And caste creeps into this as well. Tell me a little bit about the bloody

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:19.560
[Guest]: monsoon of Vellore.

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:23.000
[Guest]: So this is in the early 19th century, you know, there's this quest in India always to

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.960
[Guest]: find the first war against the British or the first war of independence. It's futile.

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.600
[Guest]: I mean, the further back you go, there's always someone or the other fighting the British

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.440
[Guest]: somewhere or the other. So there are different, each state has one version of when the first

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:37.240
[Guest]: agitation against the British took place. In Vellore, we're in the early 19th century,

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.960
[Guest]: where, you know, Tipu's family is imprisoned in Vellore Fort. There's the British were

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:47.200
[Guest]: there as the local garrison. And well before 1857, about 45 years before 1857, what they

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:51.400
[Guest]: do is they introduce new uniforms. So they tell the men that you're all British soldiers,

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.840
[Guest]: your mustaches need to be standardized, your beards need to be standardized, your turban

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:59.000
[Guest]: is going to be standardized, all of that, which in India, I mean, it's very convenient

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.480
[Guest]: to look at this as a matter of costume. But in India, costume signifies custom, it signifies

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:08.040
[Guest]: caste. One of the things about why clothes were regulated so much was because back in

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:11.160
[Guest]: the day, how do you tell a person's caste? You should be able to tell at one glance what

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:14.520
[Guest]: ornaments they're wearing, what their hairstyle is, you know, in Kerala, for example, the

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:18.480
[Guest]: munda or the variant of the lungi that we wear, if it's above the knee or lower caste,

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:23.480
[Guest]: below the knees, higher caste. So you can tell based simply on that much of an indicator.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:27.040
[Guest]: Certain castes were allowed certain kinds of jewellery, certain castes were not. So

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.640
[Guest]: in Vellore also, when different soldiers from different castes were suddenly told that they

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.120
[Guest]: should have the same moustache, and they should have the same hat, and things like that, they

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:37.160
[Guest]: were a little upset, because for them, it looked like they were being Christianized,

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:41.920
[Guest]: they were being secretly converted without realizing and they were lampooned by a lot

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.600
[Guest]: of people. And the funny thing is, the British thought the whole rebellion or the mutiny

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:51.200
[Guest]: was provoked by Tipu's family. In reality, it wasn't. Some of Tipu's family's attendants

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:55.080
[Guest]: used to, you know, sort of giggle at these people saying you're all essentially British,

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:59.960
[Guest]: behaving like British chelas, topi walas, and you're losing your, your caste identity

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:04.600
[Guest]: and your original identity. But beyond that, they were not very, very, you know, involved

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:08.240
[Guest]: in it. But the British were so embarrassed that it was something as silly as costume

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.760
[Guest]: and moustaches that caused this mutiny that they eventually determined that it had to

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:15.400
[Guest]: be Tipu's family. And you know, Tipu's family was penalized, and they were all sent off

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:20.040
[Guest]: to Calcutta and so on. But it wasn't actually them, it was simply the fact that they were

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:25.200
[Amit Varma]: trying to meddle with caste. And it's quite funny the way the British reacted and the

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:29.680
[Amit Varma]: way they were initially like, there's a great quote by here on where an officer later said

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:34.240
[Amit Varma]: that they couldn't believe what happened because quote, the natives of Hindustan are meek and

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.800
[Amit Varma]: submissive beyond any other example in national character, stop quote. So they're like, what

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:44.240
[Guest]: is the uniform and the rebel? This, I think, is from a parliamentary committee report that

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:48.280
[Guest]: inquired into this afterwards. And remember, this is also in those days, communication

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:52.240
[Guest]: is very slow, right? So by the time the rebellions happen, and it happened, ended everything,

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:55.320
[Guest]: it's only months later that London hears the news. And London, of course, is in a panic

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.920
[Guest]: because they don't know what's happened since and they know six months have passed, but

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.320
[Guest]: they have no idea whether the rebellions, you know, been put down, what's happening,

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:06.760
[Guest]: etc. So there's lots of like, you know, miscommunication and all of that also happening. But yeah,

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:11.640
[Guest]: it's quite funny that the British even changing, you know, uniforms and changing people's facial

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:16.440
[Guest]: hair could provoke such violence because people took these things very seriously.

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:21.680
[Amit Varma]: And I love this line also, quote, retribution was swift that this is when the British retake

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:27.560
[Amit Varma]: the fort. Quote, retribution was swift of the 1500 Indian troops present, about 400

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:32.640
[Amit Varma]: were killed immediately, some of them blown out of cannons, presumably to transmit the

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.840
[Amit Varma]: message far and wide. Stop good. This is fantastic. How do you blow someone out of a cannon?

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.920
[Guest]: Oh, you hit it with the gunpowder or whatever, tie them on it. And then you know, that's

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.600
[Guest]: how you blow them out. It's also supposed to be very painless because they don't really

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:47.240
[Amit Varma]: feel it. It's so quick. But how do you know they don't feel it? No, I mean, it was considered

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:52.400
[Guest]: a merciful way of execution as late as the 1870s. They were still doing it. So you know,

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.960
[Guest]: this was considered a merciful way of execution because for the person it was quick. Before

00:53:55.960 --> 00:54:00.720
[Guest]: they knew it, they were dead. But for the people witnessing, it was such horror that

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:05.040
[Amit Varma]: it, you know, made the message very clear. The body gets blown into pieces. Like imagine,

00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:09.840
[Guest]: you know, people's flesh landing on different, you know, parts of that that general area.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:14.880
[Amit Varma]: It was just disgusting, very colorful. Like if you want to make a web series, kindly incorporate

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:19.680
[Amit Varma]: this. Yeah. And for countries which debate like which have capital punishment and which

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:24.640
[Guest]: debate the most painless way to go, if this is as painless as our ancestors were still

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:29.840
[Guest]: in this phase, we've come a long way, but it's also very easy to slip back. Right. And

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:34.440
[Amit Varma]: now we shall take a quick commercial break. And when we come back, we'll talk less about

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:40.880
[Unknown]: caste and more about gender. Hi, everybody. Welcome to another great week on the IBM podcast

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:53.200
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the Scene and the Unseen. I'm chatting with the historian Manu Pillay

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:58.960
[Amit Varma]: about his book The Courtesan, The Mahatma and the Italian Brahman. And one of your early

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:03.800
[Amit Varma]: stories is very fascinating. It's titled The Tale of Two Shakuntalas. Well, there weren't

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:07.360
[Amit Varma]: actually two Shakuntalas. There was one and at the same time, there were kind of two.

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:11.080
[Guest]: Tell me a little bit about that. So you know, there is what is our general knowledge of

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.920
[Guest]: Shakuntala. She's this woman, there's this king, he departs, you know, they have this

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:19.040
[Guest]: wonderful union and they're in love or whatever. Then he departs giving her a ring saying this,

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:24.360
[Guest]: you know, it's a token that he's given her. And then, you know, one day sage comes and

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.960
[Guest]: she's a little distracted because she's lost her heads in the clouds and all of that. So

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:31.480
[Guest]: saint curses her saying that the man who you're thinking about, he will forget you. But then

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.320
[Guest]: everyone runs to the saint and says, Oh my God, you know, poor girl, whatever, whatever.

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:39.160
[Guest]: So he says, okay, fine. When you present the ring, he will remember you. Now on the way

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:44.480
[Guest]: to the king's court later and she's pregnant, the ring gets lost. And then when she gets

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:49.280
[Guest]: there, the king doesn't recognize her and she feels insulted and she leaves. And later

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:53.720
[Guest]: a fish turns out has swallowed the ring and the fish is brought, the ring is then finally

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:57.160
[Guest]: it ends up in court. And that's when the king realizes and all of that. And he goes on a

00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:01.520
[Guest]: quest and finds Shakuntala again and finds his son and all of that years later. So son's

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:06.720
[Guest]: already grown up by then. But the funny thing is this is Kalidasa Shakuntala. This is the

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:11.080
[Guest]: popular Shakuntala that the British also popularized. William Jones, for example, translated this

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:15.400
[Guest]: Shakuntala into his play Sakuntala or the fatal ring. You know, and this is the one

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:21.840
[Guest]: that was staged in Europe and all of that. So this is the one that we've largely consumed

00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:26.240
[Guest]: over the last few generations because people think this is the original story. But the

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:30.280
[Guest]: interesting thing is that the original Shakuntala story appears in the epics in the Mahabharata,

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.640
[Guest]: but it's very different. It's very simple. Dushyanta comes, he's in the middle of a hunt,

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:37.600
[Guest]: lands in this hermitage and he says, who's here? And there's no servants. She's not coy

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:41.840
[Guest]: or shy. Shakuntala comes out and introduces herself and starts talking. And he says, oh,

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:46.760
[Guest]: who's this woman with the wonderful ties and this baksam lady and all of that. And he says

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:51.360
[Amit Varma]: Mani Brahmins is one of the themes of your book. This is the Kshatriya king by the way.

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:56.400
[Guest]: But this man essentially says, lie with me, oh beautiful one and so on. And she, you know,

00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.000
[Guest]: first she says, oh, well, should I, should I not? Then she finally says, okay, why not?

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.760
[Guest]: And there's this convenient form of marriage called Gandharva Vivaha where it makes up

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:08.960
[Guest]: for lack of ritual and patience because you can simply go ahead and do what you want and

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:13.800
[Guest]: pretend that it was done and that the marriage is ready. So she says, fine, but the son born

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:19.080
[Guest]: from this should be king. So she, to begin with, imposes a condition. So she's not a

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:24.600
[Guest]: completely innocent, you know, helpless woman who won't even talk. She doesn't even talk.

00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:28.640
[Guest]: She's such a shy, docile woman. Whereas this Shakuntala is pretty straightforward. She's

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:33.400
[Guest]: got agency. She's got agency. Yeah. So she says, my son must be ruler. He agrees. They

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:37.880
[Guest]: consummate the thing and then he goes away. Now the funny thing is in this Shakuntala,

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:42.320
[Guest]: her pregnancy lasts 36 months. She's pregnant for three years. Then finally she's had the

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:46.120
[Guest]: son and she takes him to court. And there she, you know, says, look, I'll keep your

00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:50.480
[Guest]: word now. I've brought your son to you. This must be your heir. And the funny thing is

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:54.560
[Guest]: here, there's no ring. The ring as it happens is inspired by a Buddhist story that's completely

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:58.000
[Guest]: different and Kalidas borrows from there and a bunch of others also borrow from there.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.160
[Guest]: In the original story, there's no ring. Tushant has deliberately lied because what he says

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.920
[Guest]: is, you know, there are birds that lay their eggs in other birds nests. So if I, in my

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:09.960
[Guest]: court, if I openly accept the strange woman coming here with a child that this is my child,

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:13.600
[Guest]: what would my people think of me? So he says, you know, no, no, no, no, no. He starts insulting

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.640
[Guest]: her. But again, she doesn't weep or whatever. She's angry. She says that, you know, my birth

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:22.000
[Guest]: is higher than yours and whether or not you acknowledge, you know, you rule the earth.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.120
[Guest]: I, you know, fly by, fly in the skies. And whether or not you acknowledge your son, he's

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.200
[Guest]: going to be an even greater king than you are. That's when there's this divine voice

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.120
[Guest]: that says, oh, no, she is speaking the truth. And then the king says, yes, yes, yes, you

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.600
[Guest]: are speaking the truth. I was just testing you and things like that. So it's funny that,

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.920
[Guest]: you know, there's still that patriarchal angle to it. But this Shakuntala is definitely not

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:46.320
[Guest]: a shy Shakuntala. She has no issues speaking to men. She doesn't need her maids in attendance

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:51.120
[Guest]: to talk for her. She doesn't. There's no curse that takes the story outside human action

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.920
[Guest]: into divine or, you know, fate, fate, the levels of fate. It's about humans, human beings

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.120
[Guest]: and their choices and their actions. And Tushant deliberately lies and Shakuntala deliberately

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:04.240
[Guest]: stands up for herself. That's the difference between the two stories and conveniently we've

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.680
[Guest]: forgotten the original Shakuntala. And we've popularized this other Shakuntala who's now

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:14.600
[Guest]: this ideal of womanhood and Indian wifely conduct and all of that where she's sweet

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.080
[Amit Varma]: and doesn't say anything and you know, all of that.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:22.520
[Amit Varma]: And this kind of recasting of strong independent women into how you would like to see them

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:27.760
[Amit Varma]: seems common. Like, you have many chapters on women in your book, you talk about how

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:33.120
[Amit Varma]: Meenakshi, for example, was recast from a warrior queen to a loving goddess, because

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:38.120
[Amit Varma]: that's more palatable, I suppose, in a patriarchal society. You also talk about Meerabai, who

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:42.320
[Amit Varma]: was recast as, you know, an icon of feminine God loving devotion.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:47.240
[Guest]: Meera has become this big Krishna Bhakta, but we forget the fact that she stood up to

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.080
[Guest]: what Rajput notions of widows honour was, she said, No, you know, I'm going to meet

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.880
[Guest]: men, I'm going to meet these other devotees, I have no issues interacting with other men.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.400
[Guest]: And so long as I'm clear within my mind, what my interest is, which is God, I don't see

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.800
[Guest]: why you should have issues with who I meet and what sages I'm hanging out with and all

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.800
[Guest]: of that.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.520
[Guest]: So but then we conveniently forget that aspect, we conveniently forget the way she stands

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.160
[Guest]: up to her family, she stands up to her brother in law, who's trying to sort of, you know,

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.360
[Guest]: make her live in this this typical life of a widow, the prescribed life that is meant

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.080
[Guest]: for a widow who's not committed sati, by the way.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:22.960
[Guest]: And that is all forgotten. Instead, she's usually presented as this Krishna Bhakta.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.600
[Guest]: Her devotion to God is one thing because you want that in your wives and daughters, but

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.240
[Guest]: you don't want your wives and daughters to question you, to question patriarchal institutions,

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.280
[Guest]: to have the freedom to meet who they want to articulate ideas that they like, and to

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.280
[Guest]: move around freely.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.840
[Guest]: So that, you know, we always pick and choose very cleverly, where even these inconvenient

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.240
[Guest]: women, we end up choosing something that is relatively less inconvenient and making that

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:47.840
[Guest]: the main thing about them, when in reality, they had so many other layers and so much

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.600
[Amit Varma]: more texture to their personalities.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.720
[Guest]: And in your chapter on Mirabai, you in fact contrast her with Padmavati, the possibly

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:59.120
[Amit Varma]: fictional Padmavati, who is, you know, who fits that notion of a woman who will, you

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:03.160
[Amit Varma]: know, commit sati rather than whatever, and who doesn't really have a voice of her own

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.160
[Amit Varma]: in that sense.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:08.400
[Guest]: And that's interesting, right? Like Mirabai existed and Padmavati is, as you said, very

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:14.520
[Guest]: likely fictional, but they had to create that Padmavati to hold up that ideal of womanhood.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:20.120
[Amit Varma]: And even Mirabai, you have to recast her to, you know, be comfortable with sort of what

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.800
[Amit Varma]: she was.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.760
[Amit Varma]: Another really fascinating chapter in your book, a pretty short chapter is called The

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:31.640
[Amit Varma]: Lost Begum of Ahmednagar, which is about this remarkable woman called Khunza Humayun.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.040
[Amit Varma]: And she's really extraordinary.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.960
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, you know, her daughter Chand Bibi is remembered more, Chand Bibi also makes

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:42.840
[Amit Varma]: an appearance in Rebel Sultans, your earlier book, which we discussed, I think we discussed

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.440
[Amit Varma]: in the last episode.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.200
[Amit Varma]: But people don't speak so often of Khunza Humayun and you do, of course, in your great

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.200
[Amit Varma]: chapter.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.200
[Guest]: Tell me a bit about it.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.040
[Guest]: So the funny thing is, you know, Khunza was a footnote, initially, there's a paragraph

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.320
[Guest]: dedicated to her in my second book, and my editor said, look, this is a little out of

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320
[Guest]: the way.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.880
[Guest]: So can we, you know, get rid of this bit.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.440
[Guest]: So she ends up being mentioned in passing in the footnote.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.680
[Guest]: She's not mentioned by name in the main text, but she appears in the footnote.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:08.800
[Guest]: But I always thought, you know, there's so much more to this lady, because she, you know,

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:13.600
[Guest]: we have this habit of glorifying women if they're either masculine in the way they go

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.600
[Guest]: down.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.520
[Guest]: For example, Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, you know, she dies fighting, therefore, there's

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.400
[Guest]: some valor attached to her, or they have to be big bhakti people.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.800
[Guest]: And therefore, there's another kind of virtue attached to them, or if you die with sati

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.760
[Guest]: or something, something dramatically, you know, tragic has to happen with you, for you

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.760
[Guest]: to be respected.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:33.300
[Guest]: Khunza, on the other hand, she has naked ambition, you know, this is a woman whose husband is

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:37.800
[Guest]: deeply in love with her, he, you know, he and she, she clearly was advising him in matters

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.800
[Guest]: of state, etc.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:45.440
[Guest]: She dies in 1565, soon after defeating Vijayanagar and, you know, breaking that empire for good.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.360
[Guest]: She becomes regent for their son, but she's very interested in power herself.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.640
[Guest]: So the thing is, there are several attempts by noblemen to get rid of this, this woman

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:56.280
[Guest]: because they find her meddlesome and problematic, but she won't give up that easily.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.600
[Guest]: And finally, they succeed and they go and get her son to push her out.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.840
[Guest]: And the funny thing is, because she doesn't go down fighting valorously, like her daughter

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:07.760
[Guest]: Chang Bibi, who dies, you know, in the midst of the Mughal siege and so on, she's not remembered.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:14.040
[Guest]: She rots away in jail, and her son is so hateful of her ambition and her general interest in

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:17.880
[Guest]: governing and administration, that not only does he wipe her out of records, he even paints

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:22.000
[Guest]: her out of miniature paintings, paintings that showed her with her late husband, the

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.820
[Guest]: boy's father, you know, in his lap, sitting next to him, etc.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.160
[Guest]: You can see these miniature paintings where the Nizam Shah of Ahmednagar, the husband

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.360
[Guest]: is still intact, and there are maids and servants, etc. in the background.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.680
[Guest]: But next to him, you'll see this blob.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:36.880
[Guest]: The blob is what what used to be Khunza Umayyad, but which her son had painted over, because

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.920
[Guest]: he's completely unhappy with this lady.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.960
[Guest]: And because as I said, she didn't die at the end of a sword, there's nobody to even sing

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.000
[Guest]: her songs of romantic songs about her.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.520
[Guest]: She was a woman who, you know, represented ambition as a man would have it.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.680
[Guest]: And that was taboo.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.820
[Guest]: So there was no, no glory for her, no poets for her.

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:55.600
[Amit Varma]: She just faded away.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:01.680
[Amit Varma]: And there's a little interesting nugget in your chapter on her, on how she may have been

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:06.840
[Amit Varma]: sort of a cause of the war against Vijayanagar, you know, because her husband gets offended,

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:11.920
[Amit Varma]: when there's an inflammatory letter sent from the Raya of Vijayanagar, where besides demanding

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:16.960
[Amit Varma]: tribute, he also demands along with diamonds and rubies, the anklets of the Begum.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.240
[Guest]: Yeah, this is obviously stirs his patriarchy.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.280
[Guest]: This is based on one account, and which is a sort of poetic account, it may not really

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.280
[Guest]: have happened that way.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.360
[Guest]: But the thing is, what's interesting is, if you read one of Sanjay Rizwan Brahmanyam's

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:31.800
[Guest]: essays, and it's a chapter in one of his books, also, there's a thing called Kotli insults.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:35.520
[Guest]: Even kings when they exchanged insults, it was done with great style.

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:38.920
[Guest]: So Vijayanagar sends this message saying, send me so many rubies and send me so many

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:39.920
[Guest]: diamonds, etc.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:43.240
[Guest]: But they also want the Begum's anklets because they're making a point.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:47.000
[Guest]: And it's not like the Deccan Sultans were any less, even they used to know how to how

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
[Guest]: to retaliate.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.280
[Guest]: There was this time in my second book where, you know, one of the Bhamani Sultans, there's

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:57.640
[Guest]: this beautiful goldsmith's daughter in Raichur, and the Raya of Vijayanagar wants her.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:01.160
[Guest]: And he comes and sort of seizes her and this man says, No, no, you can't have her.

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.000
[Guest]: And then he goes and there's a big war, he not only you know, he not only defeats Vijayanagar,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.840
[Guest]: but poor girl ends up becoming married to the Sultan's son, who, as we were discussing

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.920
[Guest]: earlier, gets blinded and you know, spends the rest of his life in oblivion.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.920
[Guest]: So there's a lot of this Kotli insult tradition also going back and forth.

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:20.440
[Guest]: And this is one of those instances where Kunza Humayun's anklets became one of the things

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.600
[Guest]: that riled up her husband.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.440
[Guest]: But for all you know, it was just an excuse to go to war.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:30.240
[Guest]: The war was anyway coming up, regardless of whether or not the Begum's anklets were involved.

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.600
[Amit Varma]: And I wonder how these guys would have done in the time of Twitter.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.960
[Amit Varma]: There's a great chapter in your book, which I really enjoyed as a woman who had no reason

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:37.960
[Amit Varma]: for shame.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.240
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about Muddu Pallani.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.240
[Guest]: Is that the correct?

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.240
[Guest]: Muddu Pallani.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:45.000
[Guest]: This is you know, one of those 18th century courtesans.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.840
[Guest]: One of the things is, you know, one of the titles, the title is courtesan, the Mahatma

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.840
[Guest]: and the Italian Brahmin.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:52.860
[Guest]: The Italian Brahmin, there's only one, which is which we've already discussed the Mahatma,

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:56.320
[Guest]: you would think it's Mahatma Gandhi, but Phule was also a Mahatma, you know, it's open to

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.360
[Guest]: interpretation which Mahatma you're talking about.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:03.040
[Guest]: But the courtesan, there are several courtesans, there's, you know, the so called Bhagmati after

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.600
[Guest]: whom Hyderabad is named, but she, for all you know, never existed, and was always a

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.160
[Guest]: figment of somebody's imagination.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:14.080
[Guest]: There's Begum Samru, who in the late 18th century, early 19th century was equally ally

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.840
[Guest]: of the British and protector of the Mughal Emperor, which is she began as a dancing girl

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.440
[Guest]: and was married to all these foreigners.

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:25.920
[Guest]: There's Muddu Pallani in the 18th century, who wrote erotica, and famously this work

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.160
[Guest]: called Radhika Santhonam, where, you know, what's interesting is there is, I referred

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:35.360
[Guest]: to Kshetra earlier, where, you know, God is treated as a customer on his way to his courtesan.

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.520
[Guest]: And there is a lot of eroticism, there is sensuousness, one of the Nayaka rulers in

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:44.640
[Guest]: during the Nayaka period in Tamil Nadu, one of his wives, you know, she talks about, there's

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.920
[Guest]: a lot of sexual energy that's, being a king meant you had to have a lot of sexual energy.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:53.000
[Guest]: Even one of the Nayakas when he was praised by his son, you know, in a work the son composed,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.400
[Guest]: he talks about how many women his father had around him and seduced and he made love to

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.200
[Guest]: an astonishing number of women and things like that.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.920
[Guest]: So that was part of manly vigor and so on.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.880
[Guest]: But what's interesting with Muddu Palani is, here it's a woman's sexual desire that becomes

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:05.880
[Guest]: central.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:10.080
[Guest]: The theme is that, you know, Radha is getting her niece Ila married to Krishna.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.080
[Guest]: And she's, you know, prepared her and she's telling her, you know, you must bear his cloying

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:16.880
[Guest]: and this is how love, this is how you make love to somebody and all of that.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.320
[Guest]: And then she takes Ila to the bedchamber and delivers her there.

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.920
[Guest]: And then when Radha comes back to her own room, she's completely consumed by jealousy

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:28.120
[Guest]: because she thinks, oh, this woman with a body as soft as bananas is going to sort of

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:31.160
[Guest]: replace me in Krishna's mind and heart.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.840
[Guest]: And the rest of the thing is about how Krishna appeases her.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:39.120
[Guest]: But it's not just that Radha is jealous about the new woman, she also demands and extracts

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:42.600
[Guest]: from Krishna physical satisfaction.

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.400
[Guest]: So there's this one time where, you know, Krishna complains that, you know, even if

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.960
[Guest]: I tell her I'm not in a mood, she jumps on bed and starts the game of love.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.000
[Guest]: And he's almost frustrated by it because he can't quite satisfy the lady because she's

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.840
[Guest]: quite determined in that sense.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:57.320
[Guest]: So there's what's central is this woman's desire, her right to desire, her right to

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.760
[Guest]: affection and love.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.760
[Guest]: And that is something that scandalized a lot of people later in the 19th century.

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:06.440
[Guest]: So much so that the first person to try and translate her and resurrect Muddupalli again

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.720
[Guest]: in the late 19th century, changed her name to Muddupalli.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:14.280
[Guest]: Because you know, if you pretend it's a man writing about these things, it's still a little

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:18.040
[Guest]: acceptable in society to pretend that a woman wrote this, a woman is talking openly about

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:22.680
[Guest]: sex and desire in the 18th century, that people would have found completely scandalizing.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:26.000
[Guest]: There was this critic who said that, you know, her Sanskrit is great, you know, there is

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.680
[Guest]: charm in her verses and so on.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.000
[Guest]: But essentially, he ended up saying that she's a whore.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.200
[Guest]: You can't take her words too seriously, you know, what is she talking?

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.160
[Guest]: The content is horrible, even if the language and the sentences are beautiful, what she's

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.040
[Guest]: expressing is scandalous.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.040
[Guest]: Critics have always been assholes.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.040
[Amit Varma]: Critics are not very pleasant people.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.640
[Amit Varma]: And you know, it's a devdasi who finally resurrects her.

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:48.600
[Guest]: And even then the book is banned and there's, you know, all of that happening.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.520
[Guest]: It takes laughter independence for the story to be, to again, come back into the mainstream.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:58.160
[Guest]: Even then it's only in the 80s, where two lady scholars were writing this huge collection

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.760
[Guest]: of Indian women and their place in literature.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:01.760
[Guest]: And they're trying to resurrect her.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.760
[Guest]: And they also run into lots of barriers where people are embarrassed or ashamed to talk

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:05.760
[Guest]: about her and so on.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.120
[Guest]: But clearly, Muddu Pawni, at the time, she was a gem.

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:11.480
[Guest]: She was respected by the Maratha king.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.460
[Guest]: She was a very prominent figure in his court.

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:18.120
[Guest]: And she in her own preamble before the work talks about how famous and how celebrated

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:22.320
[Guest]: she is as a courtesan, as well as as a creative professional.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.040
[Guest]: But clearly in one century, things can change.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.040
[Amit Varma]: And is it unusual in itself that a woman was writing Sanskrit verses like back in the day,

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:33.480
[Guest]: like it wasn't too, this wasn't in Sanskrit, this was in Telugu.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.320
[Unknown]: But even the Telugu had great prestige, you know, you're talking about a literary tradition

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.440
[Guest]: with a thousand years behind it.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:43.840
[Guest]: But devdasi, it's not unusual, because devdasis were literate, they were well educated, they

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.840
[Guest]: had creative tastes.

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.560
[Guest]: And that was promoted at one time.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.960
[Guest]: It was only by the late Victorian era, even Viceroy's, etc, you know, there's a story

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:55.640
[Guest]: of how one of these Viceroy's came to inaugurate a bridge or something.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.320
[Guest]: And he was treated to this natch performance and all of that.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:01.720
[Guest]: And one of the performers was MS Subbulakshmi's grandmother or great grandmother or one of

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:02.720
[Guest]: those people.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:06.000
[Guest]: Because even in the British period, they used to have natch performances, they used to have

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.680
[Guest]: dasis coming and dancing.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.120
[Guest]: But by the late 19th century, early 20th century, there was this taboo attached to it.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:15.760
[Guest]: And you have the whole Rukmini Arendale phenomenon where Bharatanatyam, for example, which is

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:21.200
[Guest]: called sadar, you invent this word Bharatanatyam, or you find it from some obscure corner, because

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:26.320
[Guest]: it suddenly sounds more Sanskritic, it sounds more chaste, you remove all the sensuous elements

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:31.840
[Guest]: from the dance, you completely make it decentrous, decentralize it or whatever, I don't know

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.320
[Guest]: what the word would be.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:38.040
[Guest]: And, you know, make it a chaste brahminical art form, because then brahminical daughters

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.400
[Guest]: can also go and do it.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.440
[Guest]: So the devdasi becomes a prostitute.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.720
[Guest]: It was true that a lot of them were, you know, also selling their bodies due to various reasons

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:49.640
[Guest]: it was true that their notions of sexual propriety were very different, but it was a change in

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.000
[Guest]: morality that eventually made the devdasi tradition fade.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.920
[Guest]: And that was it was also that same phenomenon that caused a muddhupalani to suddenly become

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:03.000
[Guest]: some sort of receptacle of sin rather than a creative figure who actually achieved something

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
[Guest]: in the 18th century.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.720
[Amit Varma]: And is there somewhere where we can actually, like, does the original non-desexualized version

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.720
[Guest]: of Bharatanatyam still exist?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:16.120
[Guest]: I think, you know, Balasaraswati comes from a devdasi tradition, she continued that.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:21.200
[Guest]: In Bangalore, a few days ago at dinner, I met a lady whose family, she learned Bharatanatyam

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:26.200
[Guest]: from one of these old families that had Nata owners and they still teach in that old tradition.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.400
[Guest]: But real influence, what you learn in the big cities often is the Arundel school or

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:37.000
[Guest]: the desexualized, decentralized version of Bharatanatyam.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of move on now to the courtesan who I assumed was the subject of your title

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.080
[Amit Varma]: because she is just spectacular.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.440
[Amit Varma]: Your chapter is called the courtesan who became a princess and this obviously is Begum Sumru.

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:54.460
[Amit Varma]: And I'll just quote this incredible line from your first paragraph on her.

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:58.920
[Amit Varma]: She had launched her career as a dancing girl, not only rising to become the Begum of Sardana,

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.320
[Amit Varma]: but also to win the affection of the Mughal emperor who styled her Zebun Nissa, jewel

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:11.160
[Amit Varma]: among women, Farzand-e-Azizi, beloved daughter, and even Umtat-al-Arakin, pillar of the state.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:16.400
[Amit Varma]: She had spent her youth by the side of a much older German lover, inheriting his fortune

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:20.640
[Amit Varma]: and lands, and later joined a Frenchman in a doomed marriage.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.640
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.840
[Amit Varma]: And like you said at the start of the episode, there was also an Irish man somewhere in there.

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.600
[Guest]: And when she married a Frenchman, her troops didn't like it very much.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:32.880
[Guest]: So she, they tied her to a gun and left her out for days in the sun.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.240
[Guest]: And this was a big summer in North India and left her there.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.520
[Guest]: So, you know, it wasn't easy at all, even with your own armies and all of that, when

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.800
[Guest]: you're a woman, these men have expectations and they, I mean, one of the reasons was she

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:43.800
[Guest]: didn't marry the right officer.

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.800
[Guest]: It wasn't that she'd married a Frenchman, it was that he wasn't liked very much.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:50.360
[Guest]: He was a very unpopular character who had showed up somewhere in the middle.

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.440
[Guest]: And you know, when she married him, they didn't quite approve of it.

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.440
[Guest]: And they killed him, right?

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.440
[Guest]: Yeah, he was shot.

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.360
[Guest]: Some say she had a role in it, that it was all, you know, she'd conspired to end that

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.360
[Guest]: way.

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.360
[Guest]: But yeah, he ended up dying quite badly.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:07.400
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, just reading about her adventures, I mean, I thought this is like a 18th century

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:10.320
[Amit Varma]: Bonnie and Clyde kind of situation.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.200
[Guest]: Her husband was most wanted by the British, you know, till he died.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:17.400
[Guest]: In fact, they were very upset when he died, quietly, because they always wanted to capture

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.400
[Guest]: him.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:22.840
[Guest]: Because he'd massacred a number of Englishmen earlier in the 18th century, in the mid 18th

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.840
[Amit Varma]: century.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:27.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, he massacred, as you describe it, of dozens of Englishmen in Patna.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.440
[Amit Varma]: The prisoners were invited to dinner and after his guests were in full security, protected

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.160
[Amit Varma]: as they imagined by the laws of hospitality, he ordered his men to fall upon them and cut

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.880
[Amit Varma]: their throats, stop quote, which almost seems a sort of a banal way of killing someone just

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.880
[Guest]: cutting.

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.800
[Guest]: I don't know if you watched Game of Thrones, but there's a thing called the Red Wedding

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.800
[Guest]: where this happens.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:49.440
[Guest]: This is what it reminded me of everyone sitting at dinner, and then suddenly they're dead.

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:55.000
[Amit Varma]: I haven't seen Game of Thrones shock shock, but you know, why do I need to when I'm surrounded

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
[Amit Varma]: by Indian history?

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
[Guest]: That's true.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
[Guest]: That's true.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
[Guest]: In fact, Game of Thrones ended with great disappointment.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.800
[Amit Varma]: Indian history, luckily, never disappoints.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:08.720
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on now to a woman who also kind of appeals to the libertarian media chapter

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.800
[Amit Varma]: is called the woman with no breasts.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.800
[Amit Varma]: And it's about Nangeli.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:20.440
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about Nangeli and how the traditional image of the traditional narrative about Nangeli

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.960
[Amit Varma]: isn't all that there is to it.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.920
[Guest]: Nangeli is actually very controversial now because there's a whole set of people on especially

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:30.000
[Guest]: right wing Twitter warriors who say that Nangeli never existed because they said, where is

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
[Guest]: the proof?

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.840
[Guest]: Where is the documentation that she existed?

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:36.720
[Guest]: This is actually it actually opens up a very interesting question about history itself,

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:42.120
[Guest]: which is that this whole privileging of documents is again connected to class and caste.

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:45.880
[Guest]: Now, if you want documents to exist to be of the right caste and the right class, only

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.880
[Guest]: literate people have documents.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.600
[Guest]: You know, where are the lower caste people going to keep documents when you're not even

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:50.600
[Guest]: allowed to learn the alphabet?

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:53.080
[Guest]: Where are you going to write your documents and records?

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.920
[Guest]: Only characters exist in folklore and, you know, traditions and song.

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.160
[Guest]: That's where you find the stories.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.800
[Guest]: Now, the point is, a lot of it, it's like it could be like a Padmavati where this is

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:05.960
[Guest]: an invented character, but it's also likely equally that given she's such a strong presence

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:08.100
[Guest]: that such a person may have existed.

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.320
[Guest]: And at some point, embellishments were made to the story or whatever, but there is some

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.960
[Guest]: kernel of truth to it.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.960
[Guest]: There's definitely a tribal story that was recorded, very similar outline in the early

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:20.720
[Guest]: 20th century in one of these gazetteers or whatever, the British.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.720
[Guest]: But this is not a tribal lady.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.120
[Guest]: She's a lower caste woman in Kerala.

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:28.440
[Guest]: And people often think the general story that's out there is that, you know, in Kerala, you

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.760
[Guest]: had to pay taxes to cover your breasts if you were lower caste.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.800
[Guest]: So one day they came to collect this tax from her called the breast tax, malakkaram.

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.600
[Guest]: And she just cut off her breasts and gave it to them and collapsed.

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.600
[Guest]: They're dying.

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.640
[Guest]: Now, the funny thing is, this had actually nothing to do with breasts.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.400
[Guest]: Covering breasts in Kerala was not done.

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.360
[Guest]: In fact, it was considered indecent to cover yourself because the only people who covered

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.260
[Guest]: themselves were Muslims, for example.

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:52.280
[Guest]: So why would an upper caste person wear that sort of thing?

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:56.280
[Guest]: The first Brahmin woman to wear a blouse in the 1920s was excommunicated because she was

01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:00.320
[Guest]: considered as though she was flouting all norms that existed.

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.600
[Guest]: Brahmin men were not allowed to wear shirts.

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:06.440
[Guest]: It was considered rebellious when they sat down to meals with their shirts on, you know,

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:12.280
[Guest]: so there was a lot of this notion that covering breasts is what this is about is untrue.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.520
[Guest]: Covering breasts was, there's this funny anecdote and I always repeat this wherever I get a

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:19.920
[Guest]: chance, Aubrey Menon, who's this novelist, who's one of his books was the first to be

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:22.240
[Guest]: banned in independent India.

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:26.760
[Guest]: His mother was Irish and his father was a Malayali, a Menon, and this Irish woman had

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:31.320
[Guest]: been married and brought by her father, by the husband to India, and he was going to

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.320
[Guest]: introduce her to his mother.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.600
[Guest]: So the mother-in-law sends a maid or someone to sort of summon her new daughter-in-law

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.600
[Guest]: from wherever she was.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.800
[Guest]: And the maid comes running back saying that, oh no, no, but she's sitting there with her

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.800
[Guest]: breasts covered.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.000
[Guest]: And the mother-in-law says, if she's covering herself like that, she must be preparing for

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.200
[Guest]: adultery because no dignified woman would feel the need to cover her breasts.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.480
[Guest]: You know, there's another anecdote I remember, someone in Trivandrum told me how under pressure

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:56.760
[Guest]: from the British resident and missionaries, the Maharaja of Travancore said that all the

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:00.800
[Guest]: women working in the palace must now start wearing blouses and, you know, they all obeyed

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.400
[Guest]: because it's the Maharaja's command.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.160
[Guest]: But every time they exited the gate of the palace, they'd get rid of the blouses because

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:08.640
[Guest]: they didn't want people outside to see them wearing the clothes of a harlot because you

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.640
[Guest]: were, you had to be a slut if you were wearing blouses.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.360
[Guest]: Another very colorful stories of the social reform in Thrissur, apparently, who said he

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:21.880
[Guest]: was going to reform Nair women in Kerala and take out a procession of women wearing blouses.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.960
[Guest]: And these women all wore blouses and they were going to go out in a procession, except

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.380
[Guest]: they didn't realize there was such a large gathering to look at the sight of women wearing

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:29.380
[Guest]: blouses.

01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:33.240
[Guest]: They got embarrassed and very self-conscious and in public removed their blouses and ran

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.240
[Guest]: away from that.

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.960
[Guest]: So there are these fascinating stories about how covering the breasts in Kerala till the

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:39.480
[Guest]: 1940s was not a big deal.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:40.480
[Guest]: Nobody covered their breasts.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.960
[Guest]: It was very slowly that the blouse became normal.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.720
[Guest]: In Nangeli's case, although the tax is called breast tax, it had nothing to do with the

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:47.720
[Guest]: breast itself.

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:49.240
[Guest]: It was a poll tax.

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:51.120
[Guest]: Every low caste person had to pay the poll tax.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.560
[Guest]: For men, it was called talakaram or head tax.

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:57.040
[Guest]: For women to distinguish them, it was called mulakaram or breast tax.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:00.860
[Guest]: So when these taxmen came to her place, they were asking for a regular poll tax.

01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:03.200
[Guest]: And this is a woman, she's impoverished, she doesn't have anything to eat.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.300
[Guest]: She's pushed to the wall completely.

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:08.440
[Guest]: And that's when she decides, okay, it's called mulakaram, breast tax, I'm just going to cut

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.880
[Guest]: my breasts, put it in a planting leaf and give it to them.

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.440
[Guest]: And she bleeds to death.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:16.440
[Guest]: And you know, there's there's a place where it's called mulachi paramba or the spot where

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.560
[Guest]: the woman cut her breasts off and, you know, died and bled to death.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:24.080
[Guest]: Her husband also dies tragically, apparently, although that may be a little bit of a stretch

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:27.240
[Guest]: that he jumped into the flames where she was burning and all of that.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.640
[Guest]: As I said, it could have been embellished over time.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:33.440
[Guest]: But Nangeli was essentially standing up to a caste thing where lower caste people had

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.200
[Guest]: to pay a special tax because they were lower caste.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:40.400
[Guest]: She was not standing up to cover her breasts because covering her breasts was this Victorian

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.040
[Guest]: thing that came much later.

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:45.920
[Guest]: But people later picked up the story to make it about breast covering to promote breast

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:46.920
[Guest]: covering.

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:50.400
[Guest]: They said, Oh, look, she was a virtuous woman who wanted to cover her breasts and she sacrificed

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.600
[Guest]: for the cause of virtue, which is not true.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:59.000
[Guest]: She was fighting caste, not trying to, you know, impose or introduce patriarchal virtue

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
[Amit Varma]: into Kerala.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.120
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you've called it a siren call against caste and the rotting feudalism that victimized

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:08.480
[Amit Varma]: those in a Sunderbelly, stop quote, but I'd also say that it's in a sense beyond that

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:13.880
[Amit Varma]: also in a broader sense, it's a protest against oppression as represented by bad taxes and

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:17.720
[Guest]: you know, the predatory state and all that, which is why this was a state where, you know,

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:20.240
[Guest]: even the kind of moustache you wore depended on how much tax you paid.

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:24.360
[Guest]: So you know, when you twirl up, for example, you'll be charged for it, you're not supposed

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.360
[Guest]: to do that.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:30.680
[Amit Varma]: So Shikhar Dhawan would have like had to pay a heavy tax and also, you know, in the course

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:37.680
[Amit Varma]: of telling me about Nangeli, it also strikes me as interesting how colonialism also made

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:42.880
[Amit Varma]: us a more prudish society in some ways, not just in the covering up of press, but so many

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:45.000
[Amit Varma]: of our values kind of change.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:51.520
[Amit Varma]: You've got a great chapter on the Kama Sutra here, about how it was, you know, published

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:56.200
[Guest]: anonymously under, you know, with a fictitious publisher, can you tell me a little bit about

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.200
[Guest]: that?

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:03.000
[Guest]: So, you know, so this is one of those funny stories where this man, this Englishman wants

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.040
[Guest]: to publish this, but obviously there are all these laws about obscenity and you know, what

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.160
[Guest]: you can publish and can't.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:13.160
[Guest]: So he creates this fake organization called the Hindu Kama Sutra Society, which never

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:17.880
[Guest]: existed, doesn't put his name on the publication and goes ahead and translates.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:23.600
[Guest]: And to get past lots of Victorian laws, he uses Sanskrit words which don't actually exist

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:28.080
[Guest]: in the, in the original, for example, you know, there's Yoni, for example, etc. is something

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:31.000
[Guest]: he's decided to use in the English.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's not in the Sanskrit.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.480
[Guest]: And it's not actually there because he's trying to sort of bypass certain words he doesn't

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.480
[Guest]: want to actually use.

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.400
[Guest]: He doesn't want to use words like vagina, penis or whatever, and therefore he'll say

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.400
[Guest]: these things.

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:44.640
[Guest]: But the funny thing is the Kama Sutra is not about bedroom gymnastics, it's not merely

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:49.520
[Guest]: about sex, that's merely, you know, one component of it, a lot of it is about grooming.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.800
[Guest]: It's one of the, it's a text that recommends that men every 10 days should wax themselves,

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.080
[Guest]: because that's what a cultured man does.

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:57.600
[Guest]: You should go and get rid of all the hair on your body, because that is what you know,

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.760
[Guest]: is good behavior for men also.

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:04.240
[Guest]: It tells you how to how to woo your, your sweetheart and apparently the way to a woman's

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:10.120
[Guest]: heart is by recruiting her wet nurse's daughter and her best friend to your side, you know,

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:15.720
[Guest]: so that it gives you a lot of Arthashastra type, you know, cunning shrewd recommendations

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:21.080
[Guest]: on how you can get your way around, you know, inconvenient romances and so on.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:26.680
[Guest]: And some of the advices like toxic masculinity, for example, at one place, it says that, you

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:28.440
[Guest]: know, you can't marry a woman without her consent.

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:33.240
[Guest]: And another place, it says that one form of marriage is to basically sedate the lady and

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.240
[Guest]: then marry her.

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:40.760
[Guest]: And then it's not even making sense to get the lady drunk and take her maidenhead.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:46.600
[Amit Varma]: It's called rape, essentially, seduction by sexual assault.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:51.440
[Amit Varma]: But the larger sort of point here is that the British brought with them also this Victorian

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:54.560
[Amit Varma]: morality, and that spread itself through Indian society as well.

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:59.600
[Guest]: In fact, a lot of what we think is, you know, timeless Indian tradition is actually Victorian.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.000
[Guest]: It's all been created in the last 150 years.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.280
[Guest]: If you actually start looking at the kind of material we have in our history, you know,

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:11.880
[Guest]: today, if I were to say, paint God as a customer on his way to his favorite courtesans room,

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:15.080
[Guest]: where she now yells at him, saying that, why did I saw you with that other courtesan?

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.320
[Guest]: Why are you coming here? people would not accept it.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.840
[Guest]: Whereas that is the kind of thing we did in the 18th century, a Maratha prince, you know,

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:21.840
[Guest]: parodying the caste system.

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.360
[Guest]: That is the kind of Indian history that actually existed.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:28.120
[Guest]: But we think all our ancestors were always, their spines were erect, and they always sat

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.120
[Guest]: with great dignity.

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.840
[Guest]: And they were supremely boring people who only sang bhajans all day.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:32.840
[Guest]: It's not true.

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:33.840
[Guest]: They had fun.

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:34.840
[Guest]: They were made of flesh and blood.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:35.840
[Guest]: They were human beings.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:39.760
[Guest]: You know, they had strengths and weaknesses, they had prejudices, they had a sense of humor.

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.880
[Guest]: They were, you know, they were complicated people like us.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:45.120
[Guest]: I always say that, you know, this notion of a golden age, etc.

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.120
[Guest]: We call it a golden age.

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.440
[Guest]: They didn't wake up in the morning thinking this is a golden age.

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:49.440
[Guest]: It wasn't.

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.480
[Guest]: That's not how they went about their business.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:54.640
[Guest]: And you know, we should remember that we should, the first thing we should realize is historical

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.800
[Guest]: figures are not God sitting on a pedestal.

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:02.920
[Guest]: By doing that to them, that reveals our insecurities, that we want them to be gods on a pedestal,

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:07.040
[Guest]: whereas in reality, they were much more mixed, and much more pretty much as screwed up as

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.560
[Guest]: we are, as human beings even today.

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:13.120
[Guest]: And they had to negotiate various realities in their life, and they were able to do it

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.120
[Guest]: with greater confidence.

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:18.520
[Guest]: You know, if a shahu in the 18th century could have such a sense of humor, with this Dalit

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:22.200
[Guest]: woman talking Artha, Shastra, Dharma, and all of that, and a Brahmin saying, well, you

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.600
[Guest]: eat the cow, so you must be pure, you know, he was much more culturally secure and confident.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:32.440
[Guest]: He didn't need any sort of approval from anywhere else, whereas we now, we've been so, colonization

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.040
[Guest]: wasn't merely colonization of territories, colonization of minds, we were made to feel

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.920
[Guest]: guilty about everything.

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:42.160
[Guest]: In Kerala, you know, toplessness was one thing, so the British were very aghast that even

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.080
[Guest]: the queens are walking around topless.

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:47.920
[Guest]: The other thing was the marriage system among the Nairs, there was polyandry existed.

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:50.920
[Guest]: There's something called sambandham, where all you give is a cloth, and the marriage

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:51.920
[Guest]: is done.

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:52.920
[Guest]: And when you want, you can divorce.

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:56.120
[Guest]: My great great grandmother had, you know, she first married a Brahmin, then they had

01:25:56.120 --> 01:26:00.240
[Guest]: a stillbirth, which was a girl, and in the matrilineal system, having a dead girl is

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.240
[Guest]: a bad omen.

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:04.960
[Guest]: So when he came home to collect her, her mother stopped him at the threshold saying, go away,

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.200
[Guest]: we don't want to see you again.

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:09.560
[Guest]: And that was that, you know, that was the end of the marriage in the 1880s.

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:13.960
[Guest]: Whereas, you know, by in that same place, by the early 20th century, people said, no,

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:16.720
[Guest]: no, wives must be devoted lifelong to their husbands.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:20.600
[Guest]: A woman's job is not managing property, a woman's job is to take care of the kids, let

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:22.360
[Guest]: men handle economic matters.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:25.520
[Guest]: So the matrilineal system gives way to a patriarchal system.

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.600
[Guest]: The irony being the matrilineal system is abolished by a Maharani who became Maharani

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.600
[Guest]: because of the matrilineal system.

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:35.120
[Guest]: Her, she was considered a great reformer because in the Ravankar royal family, the Maharani's

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.280
[Guest]: husband is only the consort.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.560
[Guest]: The consort can't sit in the presence of his wife.

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:42.560
[Guest]: He can't call his royal wife by name, he has to call her your highness.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:46.240
[Guest]: At feasts in the palace, the Maharani served four varieties of dessert, her husband served

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:47.760
[Guest]: two varieties of dessert.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.880
[Guest]: She has a 21 gun salute, he has a rifle salute of say one or two guns, like that's all.

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:53.480
[Guest]: So his status is very low.

01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:57.400
[Guest]: But the British are very pleased because, you know, for example, the rule is that when

01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:00.800
[Guest]: she goes out and drives, her husband is not supposed to sit in the same car because he's

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:01.800
[Guest]: not her equal.

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.160
[Guest]: When she starts driving in the same car with him, they're like, ah, wow, she's, you know,

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.160
[Guest]: giving her husband status.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.520
[Guest]: Similarly, when she starts consulting him on state matters, not his business at all.

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.840
[Guest]: She's the queen, he's just a nobody, he's a subject.

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:16.160
[Guest]: They're very pleased because they say, ah, you know, her husband has status.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:20.240
[Guest]: So there is this shift in cultural values that happens and that Victorian, if you go

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.960
[Guest]: today to Kerala, marriage rituals include the sindoor.

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.360
[Guest]: The sindoor is a North Indian thing.

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:28.640
[Guest]: I mean, when you have polyandry, when you have, say, three husbands, potentially for

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:31.920
[Guest]: one woman in certain cases, how much sindoor are you going to wear?

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:32.920
[Guest]: Three different lines of sindoor?

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:33.920
[Guest]: You can't.

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:35.520
[Guest]: There was no such concept of sindoor.

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.520
[Guest]: Divorce existed.

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.160
[Guest]: So there's no concept of widowhood.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:42.080
[Guest]: And now people say, oh, I'm a widower, or my, you know, a widower is coming for the

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.080
[Guest]: wedding rituals.

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:44.580
[Guest]: We don't have the concept of a widower.

01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:46.160
[Guest]: This came from somewhere else.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.880
[Guest]: This came through a mix of Victorian morality and North Indian Brahminical traditions, which

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:54.820
[Guest]: have been absorbed to now people think that this always existed.

01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:55.820
[Guest]: These things are tradition.

01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:56.820
[Guest]: They're not tradition.

01:27:56.820 --> 01:28:00.960
[Guest]: If they actually had a sense of what tradition were, you know, when in the Sabarimala instance

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:04.240
[Guest]: where they were all fighting about women and wanting to enter the temple and they said,

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.240
[Guest]: this is against tradition.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.960
[Guest]: Well, going back to tradition would then mean that all the women of Kerala must walk about

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:09.960
[Guest]: topless.

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.400
[Guest]: It would mean that they should be again allowed to have more than one husband.

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:14.400
[Guest]: That nobody wants.

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:16.360
[Guest]: And that tradition you've conveniently forgotten.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:19.880
[Guest]: This tradition you want to hold on to because it's all political at the end of the day.

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:23.820
[Amit Varma]: And why did these, why did this Victorian morality and these Brahminical customs and

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:27.760
[Amit Varma]: catch on in the South, because you'd imagine that you already, like you've got a great

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:32.560
[Amit Varma]: chapter called the Amarchis of Travancore, which is all about this matrilineal sort of

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:33.560
[Amit Varma]: customs.

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:35.120
[Amit Varma]: And then why does that change?

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:40.080
[Amit Varma]: Why do these sort of, in some cases, even toxic attitudes become part of the culture?

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:43.400
[Guest]: I think it was a response to, you know, the British in the sense that they came and they

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:47.840
[Guest]: had this holier than thou situation where they said, we're going to civilize your country.

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.760
[Guest]: And they came with a new set of values and they were in power.

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.680
[Guest]: So they were in a position to impose those values and make it look like those values

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:54.320
[Guest]: are what brought them to power.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.880
[Guest]: So suddenly we were on the defensive and then they'd say, Oh, look, you know, you need to

01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.120
[Guest]: be civilized because your women don't even wear blouses.

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.240
[Guest]: You need to be civilized because your women are marrying three, three husbands.

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:05.200
[Guest]: You need to be civilized because you're burning your women.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:10.120
[Guest]: You know, you, they found multiple reasons to civilize Indians in courts and Indians

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.160
[Guest]: therefore got this cultural insecurity.

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:16.320
[Guest]: We thought that we would become strong by imitating them, but we were also a little,

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.760
[Guest]: you know, we don't want to say that we were imitating them.

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:22.220
[Guest]: So we wanted to find roots for all of this in Indian texts and Indian tradition.

01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:25.880
[Guest]: So you highlight those traditions that match what the Victorians expect of you and use

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:29.860
[Guest]: that to promote your new sense of identity.

01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:33.640
[Guest]: So we were essentially put on the defensive by the British as a consequence of which we

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:38.120
[Guest]: absorbed a lot of Victorian stuff into an Indian vocabulary and started believing that

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.120
[Guest]: this is our tradition.

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.120
[Guest]: This is our identity.

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:43.120
[Guest]: Whereas these identities are a very recent vintage.

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:48.800
[Amit Varma]: And there's a very poignant line in your chapter on the Yamachis, which sort of indicates how

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:53.400
[Amit Varma]: for a woman to be given a place in history, there has to be some connection to a man,

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:57.800
[Amit Varma]: which is quote, history has erased the Yamachis from memory on account of the fact that their

01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:02.280
[Amit Varma]: sons never succeeded to power, stop quote, which despite the fact that the women themselves

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.720
[Amit Varma]: were so powerful, it was a matrilineal society.

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:08.840
[Amit Varma]: In one case, you describe how the consort of a Maharani, when he was dying, he had to

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:13.160
[Guest]: be shifted out of the palace because it was not allowed to die in the palace.

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.600
[Guest]: Palaces were only for members of the royal family to die in.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:19.520
[Guest]: A husband at the end of the day, he may have fathered the next Maharaja and the next crop

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:22.400
[Guest]: of princes and princesses, but he had no business dying in the palace.

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.680
[Guest]: And his own wife and kids wouldn't even attend the funeral, because he was still their subject.

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:31.280
[Guest]: He and his dead body belonged to his family, where his sister's kids would do the rituals,

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.280
[Guest]: not his own kids.

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.920
[Amit Varma]: They were royal and he was not.

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:38.880
[Amit Varma]: And it's very poignant in the sense that, you know, you have these love stories, which

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, are sort of also held back by these sort of...

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:46.240
[Guest]: Yeah, because, you know, the Maharajas, for example, their wives, they're the Amichis.

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:48.000
[Guest]: So they're not called Maharanis.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.320
[Guest]: The Amichi in the English translation means mother of his highness's children.

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.320
[Guest]: That's all she is.

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.320
[Guest]: She's only the mother of the king's children.

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.440
[Guest]: And the children themselves are not royal.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.760
[Guest]: So the king will not go for the wedding of his own daughter.

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:02.440
[Guest]: He'll go in advance, give some presents, take part in meeting the people there, but he'll

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:03.440
[Guest]: then leave.

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:06.240
[Guest]: For the actual ceremony, he won't be there, because technically his daughter is a private

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.240
[Guest]: citizen.

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:08.520
[Guest]: She is not a member of his family.

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:12.120
[Guest]: His responsibility is to the nieces, the matrilineal people of his family.

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.120
[Guest]: They're the royal ones.

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:15.400
[Guest]: But at the same time, they were actually very close.

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:20.200
[Guest]: So there's this story of this one king who's hosting this grand darbar because of a letter

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.880
[Guest]: that Queen Victoria sent him.

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.480
[Guest]: And everything goes off very well.

01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:26.600
[Guest]: There are processions, elephants, trumpets, you know, soldiers, whatever.

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:28.400
[Guest]: At the end of it, where does he rush to?

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.400
[Guest]: His wife is dying.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.360
[Guest]: So he rushes to her bedside and she passes away the same night.

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.240
[Guest]: But again, she has no real legal recognition.

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:35.240
[Guest]: She's just an Amichi.

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:40.920
[Guest]: Another time, there's this Maharaja who loses his... he marries his uncle's adopted daughter.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:44.960
[Guest]: And she's about 14 or whatever, at 16, 17, she dies in childbirth.

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.680
[Guest]: And then he doesn't marry for nearly 18 years, because he's so devoted to this, the memory

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:49.800
[Guest]: of this one woman.

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:53.920
[Guest]: But technically, she doesn't, if you look at his official record of his career in the

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:57.880
[Guest]: Trivenco State Manual, there's no mention of his wife, because she doesn't matter.

01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:01.640
[Guest]: And are people sort of memorializing this with novels and plays and all that?

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:03.040
[Guest]: So how did you come across all of this?

01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:06.360
[Guest]: I was interested precisely because of this to find out, you know, what happened to the

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.080
[Guest]: men, what happened to their kids, you know, where did they go?

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:12.120
[Guest]: In North India, to be a Maharaja's son meant you were the next Maharaja.

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:16.400
[Guest]: In Trivenco, the Maharaja's title was His Highness Shri Padmanabhadasa Vanchipala Shri

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:20.720
[Guest]: Balarama Verma Kulasekhara Kirtapati Mani Sultan Maharaja Ramaraja Bahadur Shamsher

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:21.720
[Guest]: Jang.

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.920
[Guest]: Now, this is the Maharaja who rules from...

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:25.920
[Amit Varma]: I could make a TikTok video out of that.

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:29.320
[Amit Varma]: This is the Maharaja who rules from 1885 to 1924.

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.920
[Guest]: His son's name is Mr. Velayudhan Thambi.

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:33.160
[Guest]: He's got no titles.

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.160
[Guest]: He's not a Highness.

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:35.160
[Guest]: He's not a Prince.

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.880
[Guest]: He's a Mr. Velayudhan Thambi.

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.760
[Guest]: So you know, that status is so different.

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.320
[Amit Varma]: So his niece's kids are also royal.

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.280
[Amit Varma]: His niece's kids are the ones who are royal.

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.280
[Amit Varma]: This reminds me of like this.

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:48.320
[Amit Varma]: There's a nice anecdote in your chapter on VK Krishnaman and where you point out that

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:54.080
[Amit Varma]: he had a fight with his niece's husband because he insisted on naming her kids.

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.080
[Amit Varma]: This is in the 1950s.

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:58.720
[Guest]: He said, I am the maternal uncle, I have prerogatives.

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:01.920
[Guest]: He's the head of the family, therefore, and when a child is born, he gets to decide what

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.720
[Guest]: the name of the child will be because the father has no place.

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.760
[Guest]: In fact, even in my family, for example, back in the day, if your father passes away, you

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:10.760
[Guest]: don't do the rituals.

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:12.440
[Guest]: You don't do the funeral rituals.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:15.040
[Guest]: His sister's son will come and do the funeral rituals.

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:17.640
[Guest]: You know, you have this period of pollution where you're not supposed to enter temples,

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:21.360
[Guest]: go for functions that doesn't exist for the widow and kids because technically the husband

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.280
[Guest]: was nobody as far as family ties went.

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:27.600
[Guest]: He was a partner who came, fathered children, but that's it.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.080
[Amit Varma]: How did this originate?

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:30.080
[Amit Varma]: How did it come about?

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.080
[Guest]: There are different theories.

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.640
[Guest]: Some say it was originally tribal.

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.560
[Guest]: It was always the case.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:37.040
[Guest]: Others say the Brahmins, now the Brahmin side is very convenient.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:40.480
[Guest]: It says that the Parashurama brought all the Brahmins here, then he brought Deva, Gandharva

01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:44.240
[Guest]: and Asura women and said, you are here for the pleasure of Brahmins and your kids will

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:47.760
[Guest]: belong to the mother's caste, which is, of course, just, you know, faff.

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:50.160
[Guest]: That's not really what happened.

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:54.280
[Guest]: Another theory is that there was a major bloodshed and a lot of these Nair men used to start

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:56.040
[Guest]: training from the age of eight.

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:59.160
[Guest]: Mortality rates were high, people died in battle or whatever.

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:02.800
[Guest]: So forming a connection to a husband could be somewhat tricky because you never knew

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:06.120
[Guest]: whether he was, you never knew whether he was going to come back from battle.

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:09.440
[Guest]: So what happened is the women stayed in their natal homes, the homes in which they were

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.440
[Guest]: born.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:14.040
[Guest]: The brothers would go out for battle or whatever, but it was the women who held their own in

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.400
[Guest]: the houses where they were born.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:18.560
[Guest]: So whether or not the husband came, died, there could always be another husband they

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.560
[Guest]: could take.

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:22.400
[Guest]: The kids were raised by them because they had the economic resources to raise those

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:23.400
[Guest]: kids.

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:24.680
[Guest]: The husband was not their central figure.

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:26.700
[Guest]: The husband was not an economic supporter.

01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:30.560
[Guest]: The women had economic resources of their own and their older uncles, whoever was the

01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:34.120
[Guest]: head of the family, he could manage those resources with them.

01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.120
[Guest]: And you know, that's how, that's how it eventually became an established form.

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:41.880
[Guest]: And it was very convenient in gelling upper castes together because for Kerala Namboodiri

01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:45.360
[Guest]: Brahmins, the rule was if there are three brothers, for example, only the eldest is

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.360
[Guest]: allowed to marry a Brahmin woman.

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:50.680
[Guest]: The other two brothers have to find wives in the matrilineal communities.

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:51.680
[Guest]: So look at it this way.

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.520
[Guest]: The oldest brother marries a Brahmin, produces a Brahmin son.

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:59.160
[Guest]: The second will marry the Maharani or a local princess, produce a kingly type.

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:03.780
[Guest]: And the third will marry a Nair general or a Nair mister or sister and produce a Nair.

01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:06.840
[Guest]: So by the next generation, you have one cousin who's a Brahmin, one cousin who's a prince

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.900
[Guest]: and one cousin who's the minister or the military man or whatever.

01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:16.000
[Guest]: And this brings the upper caste together in strong economic and social bonds closely together.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.200
[Guest]: And that's how they preserve that social system as well.

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:21.440
[Amit Varma]: Another of the themes running through your book, which is very interesting, is that there

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:25.440
[Amit Varma]: are a lot of these sort of minor characters who might otherwise be considered lost to

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:30.400
[Amit Varma]: history and you kind of bring them to life in very sort of human ways.

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Like one, one character I had never heard of before is this lady called Malika Kishwar.

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.040
[Guest]: Tell me a bit about Malika Kishwar.

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:37.720
[Guest]: That was actually a personal story.

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:38.720
[Guest]: I'd read about her.

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:43.720
[Guest]: She's the mother of the last Nawab of Awadh, last king in North India.

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:47.520
[Guest]: And he's deposed and he accepts the British pension and goes off to Calcutta, where of

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:50.240
[Guest]: course, you know, he lives for many decades and discards wives.

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.440
[Guest]: And one day, I think he tries to discard two dozen wives and the British said, you can't

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:56.800
[Guest]: just shed wives when you feel like, why did you marry them in the first place?

01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.200
[Amit Varma]: They're the wives of a king, you know, deserve some dignity.

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:03.040
[Amit Varma]: I'll interrupt you with this great line from your chapter on Wajid Ali Shah, which I underlined

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:08.120
[Amit Varma]: because quote, in the next two decades, he divorced 50 of his remaining wives.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:13.620
[Amit Varma]: But in 1878, when he tried to get rid of 27 more in a single shot, the British responded

01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:14.800
[Amit Varma]: with embarrassment.

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:17.720
[Amit Varma]: He could not simply shed begums, he was informed.

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:23.000
[Amit Varma]: The man responded with exasperation, but the women are old and ugly, stop quote.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.600
[Guest]: And then he said, when the British said what was to be done with them, he said, the British

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:29.680
[Guest]: government should pay them, take care of them, which is flabbergasting.

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:31.280
[Guest]: But his mother was this remarkable woman.

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:36.120
[Guest]: So one of his wives who doesn't leave Lucknow, she then stays and she fights in the 1857

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:37.200
[Guest]: rebellion and all that.

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:41.080
[Guest]: His mother, on the other hand, decides to go all the way to England, because she says

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:44.720
[Guest]: Victoria is also like a mother like me, she doesn't understand that Victoria is a constitutional

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:47.040
[Guest]: monarch, Victoria actually doesn't have any power.

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:50.640
[Guest]: So she assumes that like a mother, I will speak to her as another mother and ask for

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.600
[Guest]: the return of my family's property.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:53.600
[Guest]: So she goes there.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:56.920
[Guest]: Firstly, they're being fleeced by all these local agents who realize this begums come

01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.240
[Guest]: with heaps of money.

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:00.900
[Guest]: So she's losing money also very quickly.

01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:04.560
[Guest]: Then she's very clearly told that when she tries to submit a petition to parliament,

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:08.400
[Guest]: they reject the petition on very technical grounds, because they say, oh, she should

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:14.680
[Guest]: have said I, I pray something or the other and decision use that word properly or something.

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:19.400
[Guest]: And on very flimsy technical grounds, her petition to parliament is rejected.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:22.160
[Guest]: Then she tries to meet Victoria, where the only thing they end up talking about is the

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:25.440
[Guest]: weather and architecture and so on, because they're not allowed to talk about anything

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.440
[Guest]: else.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:29.000
[Guest]: So she finally realizes that, you know, there's no point with this.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.200
[Guest]: So she decides to go back to India.

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:34.760
[Guest]: And she comes to Paris first and they she unfortunately, the weather is bad, her health

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:35.760
[Guest]: is already declining.

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:41.120
[Guest]: She spent nearly a year or maybe over a year in London, the exact dates are in there.

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:44.720
[Guest]: And she dies in Paris, and she's buried in Paris, you know, in a cemetery where I've

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.440
[Guest]: given a list of the celebrities who are there.

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:51.360
[Guest]: And the funny thing is, if you go there now to the cemetery in Paris, there are all these

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:56.000
[Guest]: pilgrims who come with flowers for all the famous people who are buried there, scientists,

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.760
[Guest]: musicians, you know, jazz musicians, pop musicians, whatever you want, they're all there.

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.080
[Guest]: And nobody knows where this woman is.

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:06.200
[Guest]: Now, I believe they finally put up a board there that says this is the tomb of Malika

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:08.720
[Guest]: Kishwar, the last Begum of Awadh.

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:14.520
[Guest]: But at that when I went early winter of 2017-18, when I went there, there was nothing.

01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:18.080
[Guest]: So we passed the square plinth several times on right on top of the hill.

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.560
[Guest]: And people are sitting there smoking cigarettes, etc, etc, we couldn't find it.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:26.080
[Guest]: Finally, I whipped up this old drawing that someone had done in the 19th century.

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:29.200
[Guest]: And based on that, I figured out that hold on this plinth that we've been passing three

01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.320
[Guest]: or four times.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.760
[Guest]: That's the one that it's not marked, it's overgrown with weeds.

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:36.480
[Guest]: But that's where the last Queen of Awadh is buried in Paris on foreign soil.

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:39.520
[Amit Varma]: So it wasn't marked, but you looked at an old drawing and you figured out where it was.

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:42.840
[Guest]: You can see the church in the background, you can see the shape of the of the thing.

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:45.280
[Guest]: You figure out that hold on, this is the this is the spot.

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:46.280
[Guest]: The historian as detective.

01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:50.560
[Guest]: And there was her, she had a granddaughter, one of her sons who went with her, he had

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:51.560
[Guest]: a Rajput wife.

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:55.480
[Guest]: So the Shia Prince of Awadh and his Rajput wife, they have a child in London.

01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:58.080
[Guest]: Then in London, there's something called the Kilburn Cemetery.

01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:02.520
[Guest]: And there there's a tomb for this little baby princess called, her name is Umdatul.

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.920
[Guest]: But in the English one, it's called Omdutel.

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.840
[Guest]: And we again, a friend of mine was there from America, we went looking for this, we spent

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:10.600
[Guest]: an hour and a half in the cemetery trying to find it.

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:11.600
[Guest]: No luck.

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:12.600
[Guest]: And we're finally leaving.

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:16.680
[Guest]: And then right by the path that skirts the whole cemetery, I see one more final slab

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:17.680
[Guest]: on the floor flat.

01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:19.480
[Guest]: There's no, you know, upright structure there.

01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:23.280
[Guest]: And I said, Well, might as well go look and we find it and this is one time I actually

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.040
[Guest]: jumped three times in the air because we spent in the cold, you know, our lips were chapped,

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:29.620
[Guest]: it was super cold, and we finally found it.

01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:33.720
[Guest]: And I ended up in a very, it was very undignified, but I ended up taking a selfie with the with

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.280
[Guest]: the grave because it was such excitement.

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.240
[Amit Varma]: Few people behave with such joy in cemeteries.

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:39.240
[Guest]: I know.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.720
[Guest]: It wasn't very dignified.

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:46.320
[Amit Varma]: Another character who's actually oddly quite poignant in a different sort of way is someone

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:50.660
[Amit Varma]: you just mentioned in connection with Malika and I think who Malika described as being

01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:54.560
[Amit Varma]: surprised at her circular dress, as you point out, which is the Queen Victoria herself and

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:56.060
[Amit Varma]: you have a chapter on her.

01:39:56.060 --> 01:40:00.400
[Amit Varma]: And that's also kind of poignant because the way from this distance, you'd look at a queen

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:05.220
[Amit Varma]: as this royal figure and what could be more privileged and more lucky, but it's like she

01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:10.880
[Amit Varma]: wasn't exactly living a life of satisfaction, in fact, because she was just a sort of a

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:17.120
[Amit Varma]: nominal monarch, you write that denied a political role at home by constitutional convention.

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:19.080
[Amit Varma]: She found it instead in her Indian dominion.

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:23.440
[Amit Varma]: So she started taking a much greater interest in India because she was helpless in England.

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:26.900
[Guest]: Yeah, in fact, foreign policy, the British government also allowed her some influence

01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:30.160
[Guest]: because at least they used to consult her, send her the files, etc.

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:34.920
[Guest]: Because that is the one space where it didn't, she couldn't directly trample on their rights.

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.480
[Guest]: And she also found it very convenient.

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.120
[Guest]: India, for her, gave her a relevance that was far superior to what otherwise she would

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.120
[Guest]: have enjoyed.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:46.920
[Guest]: And the funny thing is, Indians also took to her, you know, her 1858 proclamation, guaranteeing

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:49.080
[Guest]: freedom of religion, etc, etc.

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.560
[Guest]: People use that proclamation for decades.

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:53.360
[Guest]: Gandhi used it in the 1906 or something.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:56.360
[Guest]: The other by Naroji used it to make a point to the British.

01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:59.720
[Guest]: At some point, the British introduced income tax, people held up Queen Victoria's proclamation

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:02.840
[Guest]: saying income taxes against the guarantees given in this.

01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:07.120
[Guest]: And for her, her daughter started marrying into all these royal families, you know, one

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.240
[Guest]: went to the German Emperor's family, and she realized that her kids are all going to end

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:14.760
[Guest]: up becoming emperors and all of that, and she's going to be merely queen, she's determined

01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.800
[Guest]: that she can't be outranked by her own children.

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:21.200
[Guest]: So then she finally forces the government to sort of declare her Empress of India, something

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:24.720
[Guest]: her own son doesn't like most of Parliament doesn't like, it's passed through the various

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:25.720
[Guest]: narrow majority.

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:29.520
[Guest]: Whereas in India, we've always learned if you read textbooks that you know, Queen Victoria

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:33.320
[Guest]: declared herself or the British declared Queen Victoria, Empress of India, in succession

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.680
[Guest]: to the Mughals or whatever.

01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:39.480
[Guest]: But there's a backstory, the amount of negotiation it took, and the British because by then constitutional

01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:44.000
[Guest]: democracy was becoming fairly entrenched there, and strong, and Republican sentiment was always

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.440
[Guest]: alive throughout Victoria's reign.

01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:49.040
[Guest]: They were not happy with this claim to imperial status, they thought it was vulgar, they said

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:51.780
[Guest]: she should just be the Queen, she shouldn't be imperial anything.

01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:55.240
[Guest]: So the compromise was that she would never be called Imperial Highness, she'd never be

01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:58.480
[Guest]: called Empress of the UK or anything, she'd be Empress of India.

01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:02.280
[Guest]: The Indian title could have an imperial avatar, her original title at home would continue

01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:05.400
[Guest]: to be exactly what it was, that was the compromise.

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:09.460
[Guest]: And she was petitioned, it was quite funny, because people would petition her on all kinds

01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:13.280
[Guest]: of things, court cases, property disputes, everything, they'd send her files to London.

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:16.080
[Guest]: And the India office finally had to come up with a system to send it back before she saw

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.080
[Guest]: it.

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.640
[Guest]: Because if she saw it, she would take an interest in these things.

01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:25.280
[Guest]: And it's quite remarkable how, you know, the same thing has so many back and tails and

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:28.160
[Guest]: so many dynamics attached to it.

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:35.320
[Amit Varma]: And another woman's story, which is also poignant, and who also sort of has, you know, there

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:40.520
[Amit Varma]: are moments of sadness and loneliness, there is a woman called Janki, and you mentioned

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:44.360
[Amit Varma]: her in your great chapter called The Seamstress and The Mathematician.

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:46.760
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about Janki from Triplicane.

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:51.000
[Guest]: Yeah, that's, you know, Ramanujan's wife, he, of course, is well known as a mathematician,

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
[Amit Varma]: etc.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.920
[Guest]: And they were married when he was 20, and she was 10.

01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:54.920
[Guest]: Yeah, she was a child.

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:58.120
[Guest]: And you know, and the marriage wasn't consummated for many years, partly also because the mother

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:02.880
[Guest]: was a little nasty, and she would make the Ramanujan mother, yeah.

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:06.360
[Guest]: The thing is, he became an asset very quickly, as soon as they realized he was a little bit

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:07.360
[Guest]: of a genius.

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:10.520
[Guest]: This is a man who was petrified of exams, this was a man who wasn't very successful

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:11.520
[Guest]: in the formal sense.

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:14.080
[Guest]: But he was a genius when it came to mathematics.

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:18.000
[Guest]: And to such an extent that, you know, even when they asked him to develop proper proofs

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
[Guest]: for how he reached a certain principle, he had no way of explaining it.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.160
[Guest]: He thought God had, you know, given him the answer, and he couldn't quite work out that

01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:30.320
[Guest]: that Western style of explaining each step and how he arrived at his final conclusion.

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:35.200
[Guest]: Similarly, he was very orthodox, you know, he moved out of a house called Krainant, because

01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:38.560
[Guest]: he thought it was inauspicious because of the word cry, and he moved into a house called

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:42.480
[Guest]: Gometra, because it sounds like go, cow, you know, so he was a little orthodox.

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:44.760
[Amit Varma]: Gometra also sounds like something else.

01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:47.000
[Unknown]: I know, I know, but I'm not going there.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.600
[Guest]: And he marries this little Brahmin girl.

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:55.240
[Guest]: And you know, he goes off to London, and he's in, I mean, very, very, very lonely over there.

01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:57.440
[Guest]: He's easy at one time, he tries to kill himself, etc.

01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:01.200
[Guest]: And his mother-in-law doesn't allow his mother doesn't allow this girl to go.

01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:04.040
[Guest]: Because the thing is, if he's leaving the mother's control, he doesn't want this girl

01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:08.620
[Guest]: to gain any sign, she doesn't want any girl to gain any kind of ascendance over here.

01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:09.840
[Guest]: So the girl can't go.

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:13.920
[Guest]: So she's now saddled with this mother-in-law who hates her and clearly they don't get along.

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:15.180
[Guest]: He's lonely over there.

01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:18.080
[Guest]: And when he finally comes back, by that time, the girl is left, she's going and living with

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:19.080
[Guest]: her brother.

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:21.760
[Guest]: And it turns out in the newspapers that her husband's come back to town.

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:26.520
[Guest]: So finally, she's reunited for the final chapter of his life, they're together and as he puts

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:29.720
[Guest]: his foot down, tells his mother to back off a little bit, but the mother still doesn't

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.840
[Guest]: forgive the girl when he dies.

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:37.720
[Guest]: You know, an untimely death because she blames it on Janaki stars, and her horoscope and

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:38.720
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:39.720
[Guest]: And they have just like a year of happiness.

01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:40.720
[Guest]: Very brief.

01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:41.720
[Guest]: Yeah, very brief.

01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:42.720
[Guest]: And no kids, nothing.

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:43.720
[Guest]: It was very short.

01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:44.720
[Guest]: And he was ill for most of it.

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:48.400
[Guest]: So she was essentially his nurse in that final stage, but there was a bond.

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:52.680
[Guest]: And you know, he did feel that if she had gone with him, perhaps he would have enjoyed

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:54.960
[Guest]: Britain a little bit more, etc.

01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:58.720
[Guest]: But then too late, you know, by the time she's, she's still pretty much just out of her teens

01:44:58.720 --> 01:44:59.920
[Guest]: when she's widowed.

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:03.040
[Guest]: And this is a Tamil Brahmin woman, there's no question of marrying again.

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:07.040
[Guest]: She goes off to Bombay, learns a little English, becomes a seamstress, adopts a little boy

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:12.400
[Guest]: and starts raising him, lives entirely, you know, on her own resources working.

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:15.360
[Guest]: She could easily have lived off royalties based on his notebooks, notebooks would have

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:19.960
[Guest]: been very valuable, but she gave it away, you know, without asking for anything.

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:22.480
[Guest]: And you know, occasionally visitors would show up to go through her trunk and all of

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:27.200
[Guest]: that to try and find something, unearth more of Ramanujan's, you know, work and so on.

01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:29.400
[Guest]: And she was just this aloof figure who was there.

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:33.280
[Guest]: And who remembered him, you know, in a different way, in a different context, in a very personal

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.280
[Guest]: setting.

01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:38.120
[Guest]: And at the end of the day, lived so many decades after him, largely forgotten.

01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:41.160
[Guest]: Every now and then, you know, people would have a function and she'd be invited, but

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:46.320
[Guest]: she was just a seamstress who was living in Triplicane and doing what she did.

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:51.160
[Amit Varma]: And another woman who's sort of not been forgotten, and who has perhaps now become more larger

01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:56.640
[Amit Varma]: than life is of course, Manubhai or Manikannika or the Rani of Jhansi.

01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:59.200
[Amit Varma]: And the myths about her aren't quite true.

01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:01.240
[Guest]: Tell me a little bit more about her.

01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:05.120
[Guest]: Again, you know, there's this romance, there's an awful movie that came out, and I made the

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:08.440
[Guest]: mistake of watching it and my God, it's like she woke up in the morning and everything

01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:12.040
[Guest]: was noble and glorious and valiant and all of that, which human being lives like this

01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:13.040
[Guest]: to begin with.

01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:16.040
[Guest]: Now, her story is obviously more textured, more layered.

01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:19.400
[Guest]: When the rebellion started, she didn't immediately run off and join the rebels.

01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:23.000
[Guest]: For nearly a year, she was in negotiations with the British.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.560
[Guest]: She called the rebels, she had very negative opinions of the rebels initially, you know,

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:30.840
[Guest]: she was pretty happy to cooperate with the British initially, and talk to them and essentially

01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:32.480
[Guest]: hold Jhansi for them.

01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:35.840
[Guest]: It's only when they still wouldn't recognize her claims over Jhansi and her adopted son's

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:39.400
[Guest]: claims over Jhansi that she finally said, look, if you're going to be completely unyielding,

01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:40.400
[Guest]: so am I.

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:42.920
[Guest]: And that's when she finally went off and joined the rebels.

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:48.200
[Guest]: It wasn't a case where, I don't know, like, a lot of these kings didn't fight the British

01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:49.760
[Guest]: because they were fighting for the motherland.

01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:53.200
[Guest]: They were fighting to preserve their positions of power and influence.

01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:56.640
[Guest]: That is often the case, you know, no matter which period you're looking at and which enemy

01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:57.880
[Guest]: you're looking at.

01:46:57.880 --> 01:46:59.000
[Guest]: And this is a little bit like that.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.160
[Guest]: She tried to negotiate, tried to come to a consensus and compromise, didn't work.

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.040
[Guest]: That's when she picked up the gun and the sword.

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.040
[Guest]: And she was valiant.

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:08.000
[Guest]: She was definitely brave to, you know, lead.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
[Guest]: She trained women.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.560
[Guest]: She led armies and all of that.

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:15.360
[Guest]: And she clearly had a mind that was very, it had a certain vitality.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.640
[Guest]: The way she, you know, even when she was negotiating with the British, they were quite fascinated

01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:22.920
[Guest]: by her, by every missive that came from her, because it was argued very well, it was very

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:23.920
[Guest]: well thought out.

01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:27.640
[Guest]: Her arguments were clear, and she had a sense, she could speak like a lawyer, which meant

01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.480
[Unknown]: she was a very intelligent woman.

01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:35.160
[Guest]: And we, by reducing this intelligent woman with so many layers, who could hire an English

01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:39.840
[Guest]: attorney to sort of, you know, do her work, who could hold her own, who could ride a horse,

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:43.720
[Guest]: all of this, we turn her into this one monochromatic, glorious lady.

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:46.680
[Guest]: And we were actually doing her historical memory a disservice.

01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:52.120
[Guest]: We're reducing her into a unidimensional figure when she actually had, you know, so much more

01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:55.480
[Guest]: flavor and texture and character, really.

01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:56.480
[Guest]: And that doesn't...

01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.040
[Amit Varma]: You have this fabulous story from her youth, which I really loved, and again, I'll quote

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.040
[Amit Varma]: from it.

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:05.480
[Amit Varma]: Quote, once a Peshwa's adopted son, she used to play with them when she was a kid.

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:09.880
[Amit Varma]: Once the Peshwa's adopted son refused to take her along on his elephant.

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:14.240
[Amit Varma]: Years later, when she was granted three wishes at her wedding, she expended one of them to

01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:18.560
[Amit Varma]: courier to this old friend, the present of a particularly mighty elephant.

01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.120
[Guest]: Yeah, making a statement.

01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:23.280
[Guest]: She had spunk, she had, you know, personality.

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:27.240
[Guest]: And you know, to make it all about one thing, it's quite sad, you know, this is a woman

01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:29.040
[Guest]: who was more than that one thing.

01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:32.240
[Guest]: But we've decided that the pedestal on which we're going to put her is nationalism.

01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:35.480
[Guest]: We're going to put her on this pedestal of being anti-British.

01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:39.920
[Guest]: But no, power was negotiated in very many ways, you know, fighting the British.

01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:43.360
[Guest]: There's this essay on the Jaipur Maharaja, he sided with the British.

01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:47.640
[Guest]: He in 1857 helped the British, he prevented rebellion from breaking out in Jaipur.

01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:51.200
[Guest]: And in that sense, he would be anti-national, he would be a bad figure in history.

01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:53.960
[Guest]: But he's also equally interesting, if you look at the rest of his story, he becomes

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:56.800
[Guest]: a photographer, has a great interest in photography.

01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:00.640
[Guest]: And he's the first man who photographs the women of his harem, women of the Zenana.

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:04.240
[Guest]: And the British have created this image of women in the Zenana as sensuous creatures

01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:09.120
[Guest]: protected by eunuchs and plotting and the Zenana or the harem is this very evil, sinister,

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.120
[Guest]: dark, grimy place.

01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:13.680
[Guest]: Whereas here, if you look at his photographs, these women are strong looking, very independent

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:17.320
[Guest]: looking, rather interesting women, their gaze is very powerful.

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:21.160
[Guest]: And he's the one who brings that light into the Zenana, he's the one who modernizes Jaipur.

01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:25.240
[Guest]: Builds roads, you know, introduces gaslights, builds a library, builds a school for girls.

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.840
[Guest]: All of that is done by this one man.

01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:32.320
[Guest]: So when you gauge his contribution to India's story, because he sided with the British,

01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:33.320
[Guest]: does that mean he's bad?

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:36.880
[Guest]: Or, you know, if you're classifying people into good and bad, Laxmibai equal to good

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:40.480
[Guest]: because she fought the British, Ram Singh of Jaipur equal to bad because he supported

01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.480
[Guest]: the British.

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:44.280
[Guest]: But Ram Singh also made lots of other contributions which have value.

01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:47.480
[Guest]: He may have supported the British and that's certainly a part of his personality.

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:52.000
[Guest]: But that doesn't take away from the fact that by collaborating, he still within Jaipur managed

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:57.400
[Guest]: to do something very new, managed to introduce a number of reforms and make that state vastly

01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.960
[Guest]: better for its people than British territories.

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:03.840
[Amit Varma]: And also those judgments are hindsight judgments now that we know where we landed up and we

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:08.320
[Amit Varma]: look back at the British as colonizers and we look at independent India as something,

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:10.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, as something that defines identity.

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:14.000
[Amit Varma]: But back then there is no independent India, there is no sense of, you know, the idea of

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.200
[Amit Varma]: India is not there back in the day.

01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:19.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, the British are the people who are ruling you just in the same way as, you know,

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:21.680
[Amit Varma]: Delhi is ruling us today.

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:25.640
[Amit Varma]: And one of the interesting things about Sawai Ram Singh is his name, right?

01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:29.200
[Amit Varma]: Sawai Ram Singh of Jaipur, which you pointed out was that he was a man for the selfie age,

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:34.680
[Amit Varma]: like some of his photographs of courtesans actually show him in coitus with them.

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:35.680
[Guest]: Oh, yes.

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:40.240
[Guest]: I mean, I don't know if some, the thing is that initially, there's a friend of mine called

01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:43.800
[Guest]: Deepti Shashidhar and she works in museums and archives and all of that.

01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:47.280
[Guest]: She's the one who showed me a photograph where it's not just the harem women he's photographed,

01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:51.000
[Guest]: he's also photographed certain acts he's performing with these harem women.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:55.080
[Guest]: It's quite and the one I saw was quite hilarious because it's a woman with a ghoonghat on and

01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:59.480
[Guest]: still on her head and the torso is all perfectly covered, the bangles, ornaments are all intact.

01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:02.640
[Guest]: And she's smiling at the camera because it's almost like she's telling the camera that

01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:03.640
[Guest]: what is this man doing?

01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:04.640
[Guest]: He's such a cartoon.

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:08.920
[Guest]: And you know, he's all like focused on his task in that particular image and this woman

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:10.440
[Guest]: is completely, you know.

01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:11.440
[Amit Varma]: And he's getting the job done.

01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:15.200
[Amit Varma]: And I think all my male listeners have right now just sparked up their laptops and they

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:16.200
[Guest]: are like googling this.

01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:17.200
[Guest]: They won't find this online.

01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:18.200
[Guest]: This picture doesn't exist online.

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:19.200
[Amit Varma]: Excellent.

01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:22.320
[Amit Varma]: Because I know you, you'll send me a copy.

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:26.640
[Amit Varma]: Another Krishna woman, whom I hadn't heard of before, again, partly because I'm an Amit,

01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:29.520
[Amit Varma]: but is this lady called Balamani.

01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:33.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, you've got this great chapter called the resurrection of Balamani and you talk

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:38.800
[Amit Varma]: about how she is also, she's got, she's fortressed among a thousand anecdotes, quote unquote,

01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:39.800
[Amit Varma]: as you say.

01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:42.360
[Amit Varma]: You've got some incredible narratives around her.

01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:43.480
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about her.

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:44.880
[Guest]: It almost sounds fictional.

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:48.480
[Guest]: Balamani was again, a Devdasi from Kumbakonam.

01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:52.360
[Guest]: And she's the first woman in South India to establish a company of her own.

01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:56.080
[Guest]: And she gives priority to destitute women, women of the Devdasi community who are now

01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:57.960
[Guest]: being penalized for being Devdasis.

01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:01.240
[Guest]: The state is taking away their traditional sources of patronage, etc.

01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:05.160
[Guest]: So she creates this Balamani company, and it's a, it's a drama company.

01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:06.760
[Guest]: And she becomes such a celebrated actress.

01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:11.200
[Guest]: She introduces gaslights, she introduces the modern stage, new forms of seating, all of

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:12.200
[Guest]: that.

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:14.480
[Guest]: And she creates a new system in which she's going to enact her plays.

01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:18.880
[Guest]: She even, I think, does at one point, a love scene that, you know, creates quite a stir

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:19.880
[Guest]: with a little screen, etc.

01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:23.920
[Guest]: And she's really quite a remarkable woman and travels a fair deal.

01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:28.200
[Guest]: There's this famous story about how trains that went through Kumbakonam used to stop

01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:31.960
[Guest]: for a couple of hours so people could quickly run up, catch a show and come back and then

01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:33.280
[Guest]: reboard their trains.

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:36.120
[Guest]: They were called, you know, Balamani specials.

01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:42.560
[Guest]: And again, sadly, though, a little bit like all these Devdasis of that time, her style

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:46.120
[Guest]: of living finally, you know, gets beyond her sources of income.

01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:50.240
[Guest]: Because as she ages, you know, obviously, the source of income start dwindling, you're

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:51.240
[Guest]: not young anymore.

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:53.560
[Guest]: So you can't do the things you did earlier.

01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:56.360
[Guest]: And by the end of her life, you know, she's pretty much a nobody for a woman who lived

01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:01.560
[Guest]: in a, in a massive mansion, where the grounds had all kinds of exotic animals and all of

01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:07.040
[Guest]: that, who had 1000s of rupees to spare to marry, you know, abandoned girls to suitable

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.560
[Guest]: boys and things like that.

01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:12.560
[Guest]: She did all of this, she did a lot of charity, but never had kids of her own, gave shelter

01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:16.380
[Guest]: to a lot of women, resettled all those women, but finally, when she died, there wasn't enough

01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:19.520
[Guest]: money to even do her to perform her final rites.

01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:23.800
[Guest]: So an old loyal attendant has to had to sort of gather up a few old supporters.

01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:28.800
[Guest]: And that's how he funded her final funeral, you know, expenses and so on.

01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:34.160
[Guest]: It's a tragic story, but even then, she accomplished a fair bit to set up a company in the 19th

01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:35.160
[Guest]: century.

01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:38.440
[Guest]: And you know, modern stage and all of that it, you know, she borrowed European techniques

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:41.200
[Guest]: of how to perform on stage.

01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:43.000
[Amit Varma]: And then she was good at it.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:48.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I'm almost surprised that there I mean, are there films on her, nothing at all.

01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:52.920
[Guest]: She was, she was, so Vijay Sai wrote a book called Rama Queens about a lot of these devdasis

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:55.380
[Guest]: and performers and tawaifs of that era.

01:53:55.380 --> 01:54:00.960
[Guest]: That's where she was recently given a good, you know, place of importance, but she appears

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:01.960
[Guest]: here and there.

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:06.280
[Guest]: For example, if there's a story, Ravi Orma's biography by Rupika Chawla, there's a time

01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:10.280
[Guest]: when she wants a portrait done by Ravi Orma and Ravi Orma's brother says, no, you know,

01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:11.520
[Guest]: she's got a reputation.

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:13.040
[Guest]: She's supposed to be the Maharaja's mistress.

01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:15.720
[Guest]: So even though she has the money, he will not paint her.

01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:16.760
[Guest]: And that's interesting, right?

01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:20.560
[Guest]: Because he's painting everybody else, but he's also a classist in that sense.

01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:23.720
[Guest]: Balamani is not suitable in terms of class.

01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:27.360
[Guest]: Even if she has money, even if she has fame, he will not paint Balamani because she's low

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:28.360
[Guest]: class.

01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:29.360
[Guest]: She's only an actress.

01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:34.280
[Guest]: And there's another story of how there's this newspaper man in Kerala called Swadesh Abhimanyu

01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:38.600
[Guest]: Ramakrishna Pillai, who's usually seen as this big icon for press freedom.

01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:42.840
[Guest]: But he was also not a big feminist or anything, because once after a performance that Balamani

01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:47.560
[Guest]: had in Trivandrum, when the Diwan of the Maharaja of Trivandrum garlands her, he, this man makes

01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:51.660
[Guest]: a big fuss saying, you know, you are a Diwan, you're a man of such esteem and prestige.

01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:54.360
[Guest]: How could you garland the courtesan in public like that?

01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:55.360
[Guest]: And so on.

01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:57.880
[Guest]: And I mean, this is what you do for artists even today, right?

01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:00.720
[Guest]: You garland them at the end of a performance, you give them a bouquet or something that's

01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:01.720
[Guest]: perfectly normal.

01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:07.280
[Guest]: But it was made a big thing because this is an independent woman and unmarried courtesan,

01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:08.760
[Guest]: whose sexuality is always a threat.

01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:12.080
[Guest]: Men are always threatened by independent women who are not married and who don't have a Mangal

01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:14.280
[Guest]: Sutra like a chain around their necks.

01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:17.120
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, that's threatening.

01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:21.560
[Amit Varma]: There's another great chapter shortly after this called a Brahmin woman of scandal.

01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:26.920
[Amit Varma]: And where you sort of, you speak about the Nambu theories, and the Nambu theories in

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:32.440
[Amit Varma]: Kerala are, as you say, they are a prominent sort of people, one of the seeds of orthodoxy

01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:33.560
[Amit Varma]: in India.

01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:39.920
[Amit Varma]: But the women among the Nambu theories are not quite so fortunate, to quote a sentence

01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:46.040
[Amit Varma]: from your chapter, quote, as one of them put it, the Antarjanam, literally indoor person,

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:47.600
[Amit Varma]: was a jailed creature.

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:52.040
[Amit Varma]: She was born crying, lives her life in tears, and dies weeping.

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:54.520
[Amit Varma]: It was not an exaggeration, stop quote.

01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:59.280
[Amit Varma]: So you know, when the Nambu theories themselves are so prominent, why were the women in indoor

01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:00.280
[Guest]: people as it were?

01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:03.080
[Guest]: The Nambu theories are very different from other South Indian Brahmins, other South Indian

01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:07.360
[Guest]: Brahmins, look at Ayyars, Ayyangars, you know, Tanjavur Brahmins, Maharashtrian Brahmins,

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:08.360
[Guest]: etc.

01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:09.360
[Guest]: There's lots of mobility.

01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:13.680
[Guest]: After the British came, it was often these communities, Tamil Brahmins, Tanjavur, Maratha

01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:18.720
[Guest]: Brahmins, etc, who occupied higher bureaucratic positions within the British system.

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:20.960
[Guest]: The Nambu theories were never interested in jobs.

01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:26.160
[Guest]: They lived in huge landed estates, they had lots of property, they lived off rent, even

01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:28.400
[Guest]: poorer Nambu theories would be supported by bigger Nambu theories.

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.480
[Guest]: So they never had to go out and work for kings.

01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:31.480
[Guest]: They never worked.

01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:34.200
[Guest]: All the Kerala kings, their servants, their Brahmin servants are all Tamil Brahmins.

01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:35.200
[Guest]: They were not Malayali Brahmins.

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:38.920
[Guest]: Nambu theories were never, you know, interested in work.

01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:42.480
[Guest]: So they were a very exclusive elite class, a very small set of the population.

01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:46.840
[Guest]: And as I said earlier, to maintain property intact, they knew that their strength came

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:51.120
[Guest]: from economic power, from control of resources, to maintain those resources and keep them

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:52.120
[Guest]: intact.

01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:56.240
[Guest]: Only the eldest son could marry a Brahmin woman, because only then there'd only be one.

01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:59.440
[Guest]: So all the other brothers would marry from matrilineal castes, which meant that their

01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:01.480
[Guest]: kids would belong to the matrilineal families.

01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:03.160
[Guest]: Their wives' families would take care of the kids.

01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:05.320
[Guest]: Those kids would make no claim on the patrimony.

01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:07.240
[Guest]: So their economic resources stayed intact.

01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:11.520
[Guest]: The family and the caste stayed exclusive, didn't swell into some sort of big unwieldy

01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:15.920
[Guest]: society, and therefore didn't have to succumb to general pressures of getting jobs and things

01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:16.920
[Guest]: like that.

01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:18.200
[Guest]: So they were a very exclusive class.

01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:21.120
[Guest]: And they policed their women very, very strongly.

01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:23.760
[Guest]: So technically, a Nambudri woman was not allowed to go out.

01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:26.800
[Guest]: If she went out, she had to cover herself with a huge umbrella.

01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:30.480
[Guest]: And again, these women also didn't wear blouses, by the way, they just wore a general shawl.

01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:31.480
[Guest]: And they were not supposed to be seen.

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:34.360
[Guest]: They were called antarjanams, which means indoor people.

01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:37.120
[Guest]: They were not allowed to wear, in the most aristocratic Nambudri families, they were

01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:38.480
[Guest]: not allowed to wear gold ornaments.

01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:40.360
[Guest]: They wore brass and things like that.

01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:41.720
[Guest]: They were denied lots of things.

01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:46.120
[Guest]: There are these, you know, one of the memos talks about how, after pregnancy, you've just

01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:49.360
[Guest]: given birth, but one of the first things you have to do is go and take a dip in the pond

01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:50.360
[Guest]: too.

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:53.120
[Guest]: So you're purified because you've been touched by a lower caste midwife.

01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:55.660
[Guest]: So the rules were extremely stringent.

01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:58.080
[Guest]: And sexual rules were also very complicated.

01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:01.320
[Guest]: Because as I said, the men, most of them are marrying matrilineal women.

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:05.240
[Guest]: So that the number of men available for marriage is very small.

01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:08.680
[Guest]: That being the case, most Nambudri women would therefore be spinsters.

01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:12.760
[Guest]: And because it's sin to die as spinsters, sometimes on the corpse, you'd find a lower

01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:16.840
[Guest]: Tamil Brahmin or someone to come and tie a mangalsutra to pretend that the lady had married.

01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:18.560
[Guest]: But often what would happen is exchange offers.

01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:22.560
[Guest]: So a 70 year old Nambudri would marry a 15 year old girl, and in return, he would give

01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:27.080
[Guest]: his sisters to that girl's brother or father or whatever, they'd be exchanged like cattle

01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:31.400
[Guest]: really so that, you know, each one was taken off the man's hands.

01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:36.280
[Guest]: So this woman called Savitri, or Datri as she's called locally, she's again a typical

01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:39.720
[Guest]: case of a young Nambudri girl married to a much older man.

01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:44.840
[Guest]: And she at one point, when she's 23, is discovered to be an adulteress.

01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:46.720
[Guest]: She's having an affair with somebody.

01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:50.120
[Guest]: And under Nambudri law, when a woman is found to be unchaste, there's something called smartha

01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:54.000
[Guest]: vicharam, which is a sort of internal trial, there's certain families that are involved

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:58.160
[Guest]: in it, there's a proper council that's formed, but the council always usually, the interest

01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:00.400
[Guest]: is that the focus is usually on the woman.

01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:05.480
[Guest]: Savitri was very clever, because although she was first sexually abused at the age of

01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:06.480
[Guest]: 10.

01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:09.560
[Guest]: And this was 13 years later, 23 that she was caught.

01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:13.120
[Guest]: When the trial began, she said that I am not the only one who's sinned, there are all these

01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:14.120
[Guest]: men as well.

01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:18.000
[Guest]: So then they say, okay, the man also is an adulterer, let's try him also, except she's

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:23.440
[Guest]: actually going to name 66 men, only two men escaped because they're already dead.

01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:27.240
[Guest]: And she actually has more names in her in her kitty, but she doesn't name them because

01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:30.600
[Guest]: the Kuchhi Raja ends the trial, because it's caused such a sensation.

01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:33.360
[Guest]: This trial, smartha vicharam had happened before, and they would happen after.

01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:36.200
[Guest]: But this is the first one to be covered by the print press.

01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:39.560
[Guest]: The media in Kerala, the Malayalam Manorama, etc, have become big papers.

01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:41.040
[Guest]: So they're covering this life.

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.960
[Guest]: And she's so good at what she does.

01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:46.160
[Guest]: She remembers what warts they had on their genitals, what personal marks they had on

01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:47.160
[Guest]: their bodies.

01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:51.600
[Guest]: And the Malayalam Manorama in her report talks about how she answered like a barrister, like

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:53.520
[Guest]: a barrister making her case.

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:56.760
[Guest]: You know, she would cross question these men, because the men would claim they had not slept

01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:57.760
[Guest]: with her.

01:59:57.760 --> 02:00:00.480
[Guest]: And they were given a chance to go and question her.

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:03.280
[Guest]: And she would remember when she had slept with them on the basis of what festival was

02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:06.680
[Guest]: going on then, what day of fast it was, etc.

02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:13.320
[Guest]: Her husband's brother, her husband, I think her father, a number of people across castes.

02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:14.880
[Guest]: She had an affair with a mahout.

02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:16.200
[Guest]: Then another mahout found out about it.

02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:19.240
[Guest]: So then he sort of blackmailed her and had sex with her.

02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:22.000
[Guest]: So it wasn't merely that she was taking revenge against the Nambudri orders.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.080
[Guest]: Amofit was revenge.

02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:26.160
[Guest]: The very fact that she kept these records means that she knew that she was going to

02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:27.160
[Guest]: be caught one day.

02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:29.440
[Guest]: And when she was, she was going to take all these men down.

02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:36.720
[Guest]: A century before me too, there was this woman in Kerala who took down 64 men, all great,

02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:38.320
[Guest]: you know, icons of society.

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:39.320
[Guest]: Many of them.

02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:42.360
[Guest]: There was one who was a great star of Kathakali called Kavangal Shankarapanikar.

02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:45.760
[Guest]: And people still say that, you know, his loss because he was ostracized and excommunicated

02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:46.760
[Guest]: after that.

02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:50.920
[Guest]: So his loss was a great blow to Kathakali because he was such a big star at that time.

02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:54.280
[Guest]: Big Nambudri Brahmins from the greatest families were tarnished because they were all named

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.560
[Guest]: in the scandal.

02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:59.760
[Guest]: And it got so bad that the story goes that the Kochi Raja stopped the trial because the

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:01.440
[Guest]: next name was going to be his.

02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:06.320
[Guest]: So he sort of stopped it at the right moment before he was also embroiled in this case

02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:08.720
[Guest]: of a Nambudri woman with so many, so many lovers.

02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:09.720
[Amit Varma]: What happened to her eventually?

02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:10.720
[Guest]: Nobody knows, sadly.

02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:11.720
[Guest]: She was 23.

02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:12.840
[Guest]: So we can only speculate.

02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:13.840
[Guest]: She disappeared.

02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:17.400
[Guest]: Some, some say that she married an Anglo-Indian planter and lived the rest of her life in

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:20.680
[Guest]: great comfort in some sort of estate somewhere up in the hills.

02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:27.480
[Guest]: And there's usually a family of a lower caste person who received a lot of these excommunicated

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:28.480
[Guest]: women.

02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:31.360
[Guest]: And the story goes that if you entered through one gate, you were accepted as his wife.

02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:33.840
[Guest]: If you enter through another, you became the sister.

02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:36.400
[Guest]: But it's not known whether she went there.

02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:37.400
[Guest]: We can only speculate.

02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:40.520
[Guest]: And we can say that because she was 23, it's very likely she married again.

02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:44.880
[Guest]: It's very likely she had a family and kids, but nobody knows because once the trial ended,

02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:45.880
[Amit Varma]: that's where the records end.

02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:50.280
[Amit Varma]: And it's very interesting how she's cast as someone who was sort of a rebel against

02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:54.800
[Amit Varma]: orthodoxy and all of these ways, exposing the goddess of revenge.

02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:56.600
[Guest]: But the story is a little more complex than that.

02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:00.360
[Guest]: She's not, it's not merely revenge, as I said, the first person to touch her was when she

02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:03.040
[Guest]: was 10 years old, her future brother-in-law, you know, to sexual abuse.

02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:05.560
[Guest]: And so in many ways, she was a victim, she was a victim also.

02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:09.000
[Guest]: It wasn't like she woke up saying, I'm going to, people like projecting her as a Namboodiri

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.340
[Guest]: woman who decided to stand up to the system.

02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:12.340
[Guest]: She did.

02:02:12.340 --> 02:02:15.720
[Guest]: But I don't think she consciously decided that I'm going to be that woman.

02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:17.760
[Guest]: Circumstances created her in a certain way.

02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:21.280
[Guest]: And that ended up in a way that she would, she would end up standing up to the order.

02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:22.280
[Amit Varma]: That's all.

02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:27.520
[Amit Varma]: Let's now move on to some of the non-Indian figures in your book, because one of the things

02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:31.880
[Amit Varma]: that one realizes through your book is that much as we cast our independent struggle in

02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:36.000
[Amit Varma]: the colonial years as British bad, Indians good, it's not quite like that.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:41.720
[Amit Varma]: There are a lot of Indians who are as oppressive and as while as a British and there are a

02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:49.240
[Amit Varma]: lot of British people who come across as very interesting, very humane reformers and thinkers

02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:50.380
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:54.000
[Amit Varma]: And one of them is William Jones.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:59.840
[Amit Varma]: And William Jones is someone like, like you point out, quote, to some he was Persian Jones,

02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:04.560
[Amit Varma]: the translator of the Tariq-e-Nadiri, while others after he founded the Asiatic Society

02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:09.720
[Amit Varma]: in today's Kolkata called him predictably Asiatic Jones, to one not entirely enraptured

02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:14.520
[Amit Varma]: crowd, he was Republican Jones, what with his quote, seditious, reasonable and diabolical

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:18.840
[Amit Varma]: unquote ideas about popular education and universal male suffrage.

02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:23.520
[Amit Varma]: But as far as India is concerned, it was in his avatar as Oriental Jones, that he became

02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:26.160
[Amit Varma]: one of the sincerest interpreters of this land in the West.

02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:28.120
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit more about this fascinating figure.

02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:32.000
[Guest]: He was a little bit of a child prodigy, he was born to a very old father and his mother

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.160
[Guest]: gave him a good, good education, very gifted with languages, you know, very, very good,

02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:41.840
[Guest]: a very good translator had a good had established himself pretty much in in the British set

02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:46.560
[Guest]: up before he came to India, it was only he didn't become a political figure of great

02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:51.400
[Guest]: importance simply because he had these Republican ideas, which made him very unfashionable to

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:54.020
[Guest]: certain people in certain very influential quarters.

02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:59.000
[Guest]: So the best he could do is after several years of applying, he was appointed a judge to come

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.840
[Guest]: to Bengal to Calcutta and become a judge of the High Court, the Supreme Court, sorry,

02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.520
[Guest]: as it was called then.

02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:08.000
[Guest]: And his plan was very simple, he would come to India, work for a few years, earn enough

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:13.280
[Guest]: money to go back and resume his studies, which was Persian and, you know, general Eastern

02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:15.200
[Guest]: languages and cultures and so on.

02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:19.240
[Guest]: But once he came here, William Jones was the first person to connect Sanskrit to Latin,

02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:23.240
[Guest]: for example, he said these have all these ancient languages all have one ancestor.

02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:27.480
[Guest]: And not only did he say that he was completely enamored of Sanskrit, Sanskrit literature,

02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:32.480
[Guest]: you know, Sanskrit poetry, the grammatical structures, everything he found about Sanskrit

02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:33.840
[Guest]: he loved.

02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:37.880
[Guest]: And the other thing he loved was, you know, Indian culture in general, you know, he created

02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:42.320
[Guest]: the Asiatic society, which is responsible, you know, it created a platform for people

02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:44.480
[Guest]: to come together who are interested in India.

02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:48.840
[Guest]: So the resurrection of the rediscovery of Emperor Ashoka, Indians had forgotten Ashoka,

02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:52.480
[Guest]: it was these orientalists who basically said, hold on, all these inscriptions are from one

02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:56.360
[Guest]: king and his name is Ashoka, that's how we rediscovered Ashoka, who we now celebrate.

02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:01.440
[Guest]: So William Jones has a contribution there in studying Sanskrit and finding these gems

02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:05.440
[Guest]: of Indian literature, William Jones has a contribution there, and he opens up the space

02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:10.440
[Guest]: for these orientalists, where suddenly for many years after that, you know, it's allowed,

02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:14.400
[Guest]: you can go out, pick up these these languages, pick up these texts and start studying India

02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:17.080
[Guest]: and start really celebrating Indian culture.

02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:20.480
[Guest]: So although he said that he would never preach democracy to Indians, and he will see there

02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:24.000
[Guest]: was a little bit of racism there, he still wanted that India should be governed on its

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.400
[Guest]: own terms by its own laws, by its own customs, etc.

02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:32.280
[Guest]: So he's not your stereotypical evil British Englishman, he's, you know, he's quite a mixed

02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:33.280
[Guest]: up character.

02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:37.240
[Guest]: What's also interesting, however, is that these orientalists, when they were choosing

02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:41.960
[Guest]: some texts over others, ended up favoring Brahminical texts, because they thought Sanskrit

02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:42.960
[Guest]: was it.

02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:45.480
[Guest]: Whereas in reality, if you look at Indian history, there's Bhakti tradition, there's

02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:49.840
[Guest]: Telugu literature, there's that whole Dravidian school of thought, all of that exists, but

02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:52.360
[Guest]: they end up privileging this one set of things.

02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:56.760
[Guest]: And it's quite ironic that, you know, texts that they found at certain times get a prominence

02:05:56.760 --> 02:06:00.120
[Amit Varma]: and those that prominence is still exists in India, like he translated the Manusmriti

02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:03.480
[Guest]: into the Manusmriti, the idea that this was the Hindu law book.

02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:07.080
[Guest]: It was never used as a law book as such in most parts of the country.

02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:10.640
[Guest]: It was meant it claimed that everything should be organized around it, but nobody actually

02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:13.120
[Guest]: organized law on the basis of it law.

02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:18.240
[Guest]: As we discussed with the Vellore Mutiny, custom, local costume, local traditions, local custom

02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:23.120
[Guest]: is what determined local formats of justice, no, no local judge went into the Manusmriti

02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:24.120
[Guest]: written in Sanskrit.

02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:25.280
[Guest]: How many people knew Sanskrit?

02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:29.240
[Guest]: So nobody was actually guided by Manusmriti except perhaps at a few levels, like the Peshwas

02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:30.840
[Guest]: and a few people like that.

02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:35.400
[Guest]: But by elevating that as the Hindu law book for the next very many years, British laws

02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:38.920
[Guest]: in India were shaped on the basis of, you know, court cases were decided on the basis

02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:41.080
[Guest]: of the Manusmriti, etc.

02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:43.640
[Guest]: He often had suspicions that the Brahmins were not telling him the full truth.

02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:47.360
[Guest]: And when they were translating things, they were doing it in a way to privilege themselves.

02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:53.060
[Guest]: But although he learned Sanskrit, the byproduct was that it ended up creating or elevating

02:06:53.060 --> 02:06:58.120
[Guest]: one school of thought or one set of people even beyond what they legitimately should

02:06:58.120 --> 02:06:59.120
[Amit Varma]: have enjoyed.

02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:03.140
[Amit Varma]: And I guess what happens is when they're when they're colonizing a deeply complex country

02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:08.080
[Amit Varma]: like India, it becomes important for them internally, to sort of come to grips with

02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:09.640
[Amit Varma]: what is this country.

02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:13.000
[Amit Varma]: And therefore they create all these simple narratives and through happenstance, such

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:17.640
[Amit Varma]: as access, he has access to these Brahmins who present him these manuscripts, that particular

02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:18.640
[Amit Varma]: narrative gets formed.

02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:23.520
[Amit Varma]: And then the ironic part is that those narratives come back into Indian consciousness.

02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:27.680
[Amit Varma]: And we think that it's almost like circular, they weren't true to start with.

02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:30.640
[Amit Varma]: The British said, no, this is what Hinduism is.

02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:35.560
[Guest]: And somehow the Hindus believe that and we still we still believe in what contemporary

02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:40.600
[Guest]: Hinduism is, that shape is largely from the 19th and late 18th century, based on including

02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:42.000
[Guest]: all these orientalists did.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:46.760
[Guest]: Not so much sanskari, but Victorian, Vedic Hinduism is not today's Hinduism.

02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:51.200
[Guest]: And it's not Advaita or Shankaracharya's era, that Hinduism is not today's Hinduism.

02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:55.000
[Guest]: Today's Hinduism was hugely influenced by the orientalists and dynamics of the early

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.800
[Guest]: and late 19th century.

02:07:56.800 --> 02:08:00.760
[Guest]: Because that's when a lot of these ideas were being, you know, people are chewing on them,

02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:04.720
[Guest]: regurgitating them and figuring out that this is what it means now to be a Hindu.

02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:08.640
[Amit Varma]: So it's really ironic, because that means so much of our national identity today, the

02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:13.120
[Amit Varma]: national identity of some people today is predicated upon what our colonial masters

02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:15.600
[Amit Varma]: wanted us, wanted to believe about us.

02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:18.840
[Guest]: And you made a good point, right, which is that in a ruling over an alien country meant

02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:21.920
[Guest]: you have to find sources of information to understand that country.

02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:25.120
[Guest]: So these people, they obviously didn't have the patience to go looking for lower caste

02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:26.120
[Guest]: people songs and folklore.

02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:29.280
[Guest]: They didn't have the patience to go into different regional languages.

02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:33.640
[Guest]: One language they found everywhere in India, even if it was used only by 1% of the population

02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:34.640
[Guest]: was Sanskrit.

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:37.480
[Guest]: Whichever corner they went, there was at least one Brahmin who had the same text, the same

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:38.480
[Guest]: Vedas, the same language.

02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:42.120
[Guest]: So they said, hold on, this is one common thread that runs throughout the country.

02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:46.520
[Guest]: But we only use this to understand the country, which meant they created laws, they created

02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:49.640
[Guest]: manuals, they created books that were built on this.

02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:53.640
[Guest]: And since then, you know, those today, when you go back all the census reports, all these

02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:58.160
[Guest]: British reports, this whole obsession with what the reports say of that time, it all

02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:03.400
[Guest]: comes from this, from this quest to create a corpus of written material, because that's

02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:06.480
[Guest]: by writing it, they were also giving themselves a sense of confidence that they knew what

02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:07.480
[Guest]: they were doing.

02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:08.480
[Amit Varma]: And also, you have no idea.

02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:11.600
[Amit Varma]: And also, you get into any country, you want to become powerful and influential, the first

02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:14.800
[Amit Varma]: thing you'll do is you'll capture the elites, you'll interact mostly with the elites.

02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:19.080
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, that completely biases how you look at that society.

02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:23.680
[Amit Varma]: Another really fascinating character to me was a gentleman named Sir Arthur Cotton.

02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:27.960
[Amit Varma]: And there's this great sentence of his which, you know, really appealed to the modern libertarian

02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:28.960
[Amit Varma]: me.

02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:34.120
[Amit Varma]: He once argued against the term collector, since it suggested that the sole interest

02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:39.040
[Amit Varma]: of revenue officials lay in extracting money, when surely they were also responsible for

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:42.040
[Amit Varma]: that other thing called development, stop quote.

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:48.520
[Amit Varma]: And also it I mean, his naivete, of course, is very sort of touching and funny.

02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And tell me a little bit about him.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:53.280
[Amit Varma]: He was a bit of a crusader for all kinds of causes.

02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:58.480
[Guest]: Arthur Cotton, actually, I have a, his family, the Cottons, one of them, one of the later

02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:00.740
[Guest]: Cottons was resident in Travancore.

02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:05.000
[Guest]: So I first heard of Arthur Cotton when I went to meet this resident's nephew in London,

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.840
[Guest]: and he and his wife, Robin and Nicolette Cotton.

02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:12.080
[Guest]: And over there, they showed me, you know, pictures of this man and this book.

02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:14.520
[Guest]: And they told me that they'd just been on a cruise.

02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:17.080
[Guest]: And they then stopped somewhere in India.

02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:21.160
[Guest]: And they were brought by the government, the then government of Andhra Pradesh, to an event

02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:25.040
[Guest]: commemorating Arthur Cotton's birth anniversary, where they were all garlanded, the husband

02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:28.920
[Guest]: and wife were garlanded, and the big politicians were all present, and they were all celebrating

02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:29.920
[Guest]: Arthur Cotton's birthday.

02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:32.600
[Guest]: I was like, well, and this was, you know, several years ago, and I thought what there's

02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:37.480
[Guest]: a state where an Englishman's birthday is still celebrated as this Jayanti really.

02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:39.600
[Guest]: And they told me there are 1000s of statues to him.

02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:44.080
[Guest]: And I did some basic googling at that time, I did find out that an estimated 3000 statues

02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:48.160
[Guest]: to Arthur Cotton in the Godavari basin area.

02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:50.560
[Guest]: And the reason is that this is the man who irrigated that area.

02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:54.360
[Guest]: He is a man who for the first time suggested connecting all of India's rivers.

02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:58.600
[Guest]: When the British were making money with this whole railway program, you know, huge investors,

02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:02.280
[Guest]: big money, a very sexy program, you know, connecting India through railways.

02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:05.280
[Guest]: He's the one who said, why are you building railways, connect all the rivers, you'll have

02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:09.480
[Guest]: canals, that's cheaper, and it has the other advantage that it irrigates land.

02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:12.560
[Guest]: And this is an idea that's still very much being discussed like this government also,

02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:16.560
[Guest]: for example, they're talking about interlinking rivers, environmentalists don't like it, but

02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:19.280
[Guest]: it's it's economically people say that it has a certain value.

02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.640
[Guest]: Arthur Cotton is the first person to suggest it.

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:25.280
[Guest]: In that Godavari area, he's the one who built all these canals and so on.

02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:29.820
[Guest]: So farmers, even today, after all these generations are beholden to him, they see him as a sort

02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:34.840
[Guest]: of savior who made what were barren lands overnight, you know, after by the end of his career,

02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:38.400
[Guest]: these are all fertile lands where they were finally being able to live well and grow things

02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.400
[Guest]: properly.

02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:45.180
[Guest]: And he, as I said, you know, wasn't very keen on merely, it was a good Christian at heart.

02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:47.440
[Guest]: So he genuinely believed he was here to civilize India.

02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:49.120
[Guest]: So there's that to be sure.

02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:52.240
[Guest]: But all the same, he felt that if the British were ruling India, they couldn't simply extract

02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:53.720
[Guest]: revenues and do what they wanted.

02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:58.400
[Guest]: They owed it to the people of India to improve their lives also, in his case, economically

02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:00.640
[Guest]: through canals and that sort of program.

02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:04.440
[Guest]: And which is why, you know, the common peasant even now remembers him politicians even to

02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:09.480
[Guest]: do on his birthday to garland his busts and statues, because Arthur Cotton left a lasting

02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:13.240
[Guest]: legacy in a large part of the peninsula in the south.

02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:16.600
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting about how as a reformer within the government of the time, he ran

02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:20.760
[Amit Varma]: up against what we would today call the political economy, like there's another great sentence,

02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:27.400
[Amit Varma]: quote, between 1885 and 1887, the railways cost 2.84 million pounds, while the irrigation

02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:31.720
[Amit Varma]: budget stagnated at a measly 6000 pounds.

02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:35.760
[Amit Varma]: And you know, this is obviously something he protested against.

02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:40.160
[Amit Varma]: And eventually, they gave in to him a little bit in the sense that the PWD of today, the

02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:46.480
[Amit Varma]: Public Works Department is sort of named after him, but he was largely despite that a crusader

02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:49.440
[Amit Varma]: for what at that time was a lost cause.

02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:52.960
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting, again, talking about the railways, because, you know, like you

02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:58.520
[Amit Varma]: said, Cotton sort of, of course, felt that the colonialists instead of just extracting

02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:00.680
[Amit Varma]: need to give something back to the people.

02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:05.240
[Amit Varma]: But the railways, much as even Gandhi railed against it, and henceforth, wasn't just a

02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:09.880
[Amit Varma]: tool of extraction and convenience for the British, like one of the reasons the British,

02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:13.320
[Amit Varma]: I think, really wanted to spread railways across India, as you point out in your book

02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:19.240
[Amit Varma]: was after the 1857 revolt, it became a means of getting loyal troops to wherever the revolt

02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:21.000
[Amit Varma]: had broken out very quickly.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.640
[Amit Varma]: So it's a matter of convenience.

02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:26.040
[Amit Varma]: But even apart from that, the railways did a heck of a lot of good for India.

02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:31.640
[Guest]: The funny thing is, again, you often find the story of the right wing, you don't understand

02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:35.520
[Guest]: how much instruments of modernity that came from the West have enabled the right, it's

02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:38.680
[Guest]: happening now, you know, you have technology like Twitter, created for one thing, but being

02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:43.640
[Guest]: marshaled by right wing groups across the world for disinformation, whatever, and, you

02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:45.920
[Guest]: know, polarizing the debate in their favor.

02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:48.680
[Guest]: The railways did something very interesting, which is that they came, they were initially

02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:49.680
[Guest]: a disruption.

02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:52.880
[Guest]: You know, when the Maharaja of Travancore wanted to bring the railways to Trivandrum

02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:56.440
[Guest]: in the 1880s, the Brahmins said, No, no, you can't bring the sinful fire carriage into

02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:00.680
[Guest]: the sacred town where Shri Padmanabhaswamy lives in the temple.

02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:04.440
[Guest]: So he didn't, the railway station was at outside town.

02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:08.840
[Guest]: But what they quickly realized in many parts of India was that suddenly, for example, the

02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:14.280
[Guest]: distance from Calcutta to Puri was reduced from very many days, a trek of weeks to a

02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:16.720
[Guest]: railway journey of say, a couple of days.

02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:20.660
[Guest]: So suddenly larger volumes of people started coming in more pilgrim means more money into

02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:24.200
[Guest]: temple coffers, more money into temple coffers means the priests are happy, there's more

02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:27.160
[Guest]: to do temples, more temples can be built.

02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:31.440
[Guest]: The railway sparked not only movement of troops, it also sparked movement of pilgrims, it also

02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:34.400
[Guest]: sparked movement of Indians within the country.

02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:39.880
[Guest]: And there's this, you know, I think his name is Arup Chatterjee, talks about how, you know,

02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:42.240
[Guest]: Indians who otherwise could not eat beef, etc.

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:46.120
[Guest]: So vegetarian looking businessmen could get on the railways and then experiment with whatever

02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:50.160
[Guest]: they wanted, because suddenly it was a space where lots of rules could be flouted.

02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:54.120
[Amit Varma]: And also a space where diversity could flourish, because you had so many people traveling in

02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:58.880
[Amit Varma]: the trains together that you couldn't perforce be too conscious about who you're necessarily

02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:03.040
[Amit Varma]: traveling with something which even are, you know, a function which even our Bombay locals

02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:04.040
[Amit Varma]: perform.

02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:07.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there can be no casteism within a Bombay local.

02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:10.800
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting that some of the things that the British brought to India for their

02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:13.280
[Amit Varma]: own purposes eventually worked against them.

02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:18.280
[Amit Varma]: For example, they got railways, so that they could ferry troops around quickly and ferry

02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:20.320
[Amit Varma]: their goods around quickly and so on and so forth.

02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:26.240
[Amit Varma]: But it also became a tool for people within our freedom movement to either raise support

02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:27.240
[Guest]: or travel quickly.

02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:31.160
[Guest]: Every railway platform, wherever his train stopped, all he had to do was look out from

02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:34.840
[Guest]: the window and give a speech and that became a platform for nationalism.

02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:39.360
[Guest]: So he hated the railways, but he ended up using it very effectively for his purposes.

02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:44.280
[Guest]: And you know, that actually talks about how every platform turned into a scene for nationalistic

02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:45.280
[Guest]: activity.

02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:50.080
[Guest]: So, pulling the chain became like a big act of rebellion, when civil disobedience was

02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:51.080
[Unknown]: going on.

02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:55.200
[Guest]: So, you know, the railways became a very interesting encapsulation of these people trying to civilize

02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:58.920
[Guest]: India but Indians picking that up and using it for their own purposes and getting better

02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:01.200
[Guest]: at, you know, understanding that thing.

02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:04.320
[Amit Varma]: And just as that happened with railways, it also happened with English.

02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:07.160
[Amit Varma]: They brought the English here as a common language to govern us.

02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:10.560
[Amit Varma]: But if you look at all our freedom fighters, if you look at the first time the Congress

02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:15.520
[Amit Varma]: met, for example, you point out in your book about how all attendees to the first general

02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:19.120
[Amit Varma]: meeting of the Congress were told that they must be conversing in English, because otherwise,

02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:22.440
[Amit Varma]: how would so many diverse people be able to speak to each other?

02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:27.520
[Amit Varma]: And again, it was in English that a lot of our great early freedom fighters who are actually

02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:33.800
[Amit Varma]: quintessentially, in some ways, British liberals like Nauroji and Agarkar, Gokhale Ranade,

02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:37.160
[Amit Varma]: all of those guys, so many of their ideas came from reading books which were written

02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:38.160
[Amit Varma]: in English.

02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:42.600
[Guest]: I mean, frankly, you don't even need to look at books, look at the basic people who were

02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:43.600
[Guest]: involved.

02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:47.200
[Guest]: Gandhiji grew up in Gujarat, spoke Gujarati, Nehru was a Kashmiri, grew up in Allahabad,

02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:52.320
[Guest]: probably spoke Hindi, Bose grew up in Bengal, speaking Bengali, Rajagopalachari in Tamil

02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:55.520
[Guest]: not speaking Tamil, Tilak was in Maharashtra speaking Marathi.

02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:58.480
[Guest]: Now, if these people didn't have English as a common language, they wouldn't have been

02:16:58.480 --> 02:16:59.720
[Guest]: able to speak to each other.

02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:00.720
[Guest]: Sanskrit was not possible.

02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:02.640
[Guest]: I mean, who's going to learn Sanskrit and speak?

02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:06.520
[Guest]: Different castes had different problems in terms of access to Sanskrit.

02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:11.240
[Guest]: English was what allowed these people to first come together and formulate a common identity.

02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:14.280
[Guest]: That Congress meeting you refer to, it's funny that the first circular says that you must

02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:17.200
[Guest]: be able to speak English to attend the Congress meeting.

02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:19.880
[Guest]: But there's also a press report from that time which talks about that meeting and how

02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:23.840
[Guest]: fascinating it looked to the press correspondent there, because he said this is the first time

02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:27.960
[Guest]: in India that you see Pathans from the Northeast in their Pathan suits, you see these South

02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:31.360
[Guest]: Indians who don't even wear shirts and just have a munda and a shawl around their thing.

02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:34.560
[Guest]: You have some people who are wearing shoes, some people who don't even wear slippers.

02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:38.720
[Guest]: You have some people who, and this is racist, but you know, some people dark as coal, and

02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:42.440
[Guest]: some people, you know, who are fair and light eyed, who've come from the North, etc.

02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:46.560
[Guest]: All these people in one place and that correspondent ends the report saying, the only place you

02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:49.360
[Guest]: would normally see this so far was a fancy dress ball.

02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:52.000
[Guest]: And this is for the first time these people have come here for a political purpose.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:55.960
[Amit Varma]: So you can even speculate it's the birth of the idea of India by English.

02:17:55.960 --> 02:17:59.760
[Guest]: I suppose, yeah, I mean, the present day idea of India, yeah, I think there was, I mean,

02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:02.960
[Guest]: people often say the British created the idea of India, they created our political contours,

02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:05.720
[Guest]: they're the ones who gave us the shape that we have there.

02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:09.040
[Guest]: The Northeastern districts could easily have gone to Burma, the British made an administrative

02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:10.680
[Guest]: decision to keep it in India.

02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:13.640
[Guest]: That's why it's still pretty much, you know, it became part of the Indian Union afterwards.

02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:17.320
[Guest]: If they had chosen to put it with Burma, it would have gone to Burma.

02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:19.320
[Guest]: That's just how things happened.

02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:23.120
[Guest]: And yeah, but I wouldn't say that, you know, they invented India as such, they invented

02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:27.480
[Guest]: modern India, perhaps, they helped galvanize forces that were there.

02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:31.000
[Guest]: But some sense of civilizational unity seems to have existed, you know, that's something

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.720
[Guest]: Nehru also talks about.

02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:36.960
[Guest]: Even a Savarkar alludes to it, for example, they all acknowledge that at the end of the

02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:42.840
[Guest]: day, people knew this subcontinent was one common space, whether or not it was a nation,

02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:46.840
[Guest]: that English definitely helped that English and having a common oppressor helped everybody

02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:51.680
[Guest]: that took away other internal differences and created a common goal to focus on.

02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:55.160
[Amit Varma]: And there are fascinating Indian characters in your book also whom I hadn't really heard

02:18:55.160 --> 02:19:00.000
[Amit Varma]: of, but partly because of perhaps North Indian bias, not just mine, but the North Indian

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:01.760
[Amit Varma]: bias of historians and so on.

02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:07.040
[Amit Varma]: But one of them you describe in a chapter called the champion of Tuticorin is this gentleman

02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:08.040
[Amit Varma]: named V.O.

02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:09.040
[Amit Varma]: Chidambaram Pillai.

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:10.040
[Guest]: Tell me a bit about him.

02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:14.200
[Guest]: It's a sad story, actually, because his, you know, heyday was very few years when he's

02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:15.260
[Guest]: still very young.

02:19:15.260 --> 02:19:19.320
[Guest]: And then he lived for decades, pretty much as a disillusioned man.

02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:22.480
[Guest]: Because what he does is he's a lawyer, his father's a lawyer, he's from a well off family,

02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:27.200
[Guest]: not a Brahmin, well off family in Tamil Nadu, ends up coming to Tuticorin and becomes a

02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:28.200
[Guest]: lawyer there.

02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:29.200
[Guest]: But then he starts a shipping company.

02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:32.960
[Guest]: Now, at that time, the entire shipping business is monopolized by the British.

02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:34.760
[Guest]: So for him, Swadeshi meant this.

02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:38.480
[Guest]: Now, everywhere in the country, everywhere else, it's about spinning and making textiles

02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:40.920
[Guest]: and thread and cloth and that sort of thing.

02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:42.520
[Guest]: But this man is the most ambitious one.

02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:47.640
[Guest]: He's created a shipping company called Swadeshi, where he's going to ship goods to Ceylon and

02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:48.640
[Guest]: places.

02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:52.620
[Guest]: At one point, the British, you know, coerce the person who's leased him the ship to withdraw.

02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:58.320
[Guest]: So then he gets a ship from Bombay and flies into the harbor with the flag, etc., you know,

02:19:58.320 --> 02:19:59.320
[Guest]: very glamorously.

02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:04.720
[Guest]: So he was clearly a man with personality and spunk.

02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:10.320
[Guest]: But then, you know, this one time there's a riot, it was to celebrate another freedom

02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:14.120
[Guest]: fighter from Bengal, connected to that, but there was going to be a public procession,

02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:15.120
[Guest]: etc.

02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:19.160
[Guest]: This man was preemptively jailed with somebody else, there were riots that broke out, he

02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:21.360
[Guest]: was held morally responsible, etc.

02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:23.560
[Guest]: And at the end of it, he was thrown into prison for a few years.

02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:27.320
[Guest]: It was meant to be a much longer sentence, but he served only about under half a decade

02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:28.320
[Guest]: in prison.

02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:31.680
[Guest]: But the problem is, by then, the shipping company had failed, most of his friends had

02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:34.120
[Guest]: disappeared or they were thrown in jail.

02:20:34.120 --> 02:20:36.880
[Guest]: And by the time he came out, the freedom struggle had also changed.

02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:40.720
[Guest]: He was close to Tilak, for example, and a different generation of nationalists.

02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:44.680
[Guest]: By the time he came out and tried to find his feet again, Gandhi was in the picture.

02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:48.680
[Guest]: And you know, there's a rather moving episode where he essentially has this exchange with

02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:51.540
[Guest]: Gandhi about Gandhi promising to send him money.

02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:54.040
[Guest]: And for months and months, he's like, where's the money, you know, you promise I need the

02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:57.000
[Guest]: money now because he's impoverished, he has no money.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:00.080
[Guest]: And his legal license has been suspended.

02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:03.400
[Guest]: He ends up giving tuition to college kids, etc, to get by.

02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:05.560
[Guest]: And you know, doing small trades and things like that.

02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:06.760
[Guest]: And that's how he ends up dying.

02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:07.840
[Guest]: He's forgotten.

02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:11.520
[Guest]: And we often don't realize that in the freedom struggle, there are these giants and tall

02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:15.920
[Guest]: figures of the freedom struggle, but they also stand on very many others whose stories

02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:20.440
[Guest]: collapsed very quickly, because you know, they couldn't make it to the end.

02:21:20.440 --> 02:21:25.520
[Guest]: They tried, they fought, they did their best, but they were also destroyed in the process.

02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:29.480
[Guest]: And it's kind of poignant to talk about how he had his legal license restored by a judge

02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:34.120
[Unknown]: called Wallace, and he therefore named his son Wallace.

02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:37.680
[Amit Varma]: And you know, what kind of struck me about this remarkable figure was you have a sentence

02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:42.560
[Amit Varma]: there about how, quote, the idea of Swadeshi as popularized by the Congress was limited

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:47.680
[Amit Varma]: to such tokenisms as making candles and bangles, stop quote, almost like the online petitioners

02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:50.040
[Amit Varma]: of today, a lot of posturing and so on.

02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:53.360
[Guest]: And this was a man who put his money where his mouth was, he went all in.

02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:54.360
[Guest]: And regretted it, right?

02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:57.760
[Guest]: Because it's very easy, nationalism of convenience is very easy, right?

02:21:57.760 --> 02:21:59.440
[Guest]: Many people say we are nationalists.

02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:00.440
[Guest]: Why?

02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:02.520
[Guest]: Because when the national anthem plays in a movie theater, they stand up very convenient,

02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:05.320
[Guest]: no standing up, sitting down nationalism over and done.

02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:07.880
[Guest]: And you can give yourself a certificate that you're a nationalist.

02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:11.000
[Guest]: When it comes to actually doing something that nobody's going to do, because that's

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000
[Guest]: going to be inconvenient.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:13.120
[Guest]: And that comes with risk.

02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:14.920
[Amit Varma]: This man took the risk and lived to regret it.

02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:16.760
[Amit Varma]: He put all his skin in the game.

02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:20.960
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, these the British offered to buy his company out for one lakh rupees.

02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:25.760
[Amit Varma]: And he said, he refused, and a decade later, he's begging Mahatma Gandhi, where is my 347

02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:26.760
[Amit Varma]: rupees?

02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:27.760
[Amit Varma]: And that's heartbreaking.

02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:31.720
[Guest]: And, and did Gandhi not know of his past, by the way, people did, but the thing is,

02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:34.000
[Guest]: right, you know, in the movements moving on, right?

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:35.440
[Guest]: It's a big thing that's happening.

02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:39.840
[Guest]: And no, I'm not saying it was bad on Gandhi's part, bad on the part of other nationalists,

02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:40.840
[Guest]: but the world was changing.

02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:42.640
[Guest]: They had to focus on other goals.

02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:45.080
[Guest]: And there were many who were going to fall by the wayside.

02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:49.640
[Guest]: You know, even now, you know, then you see this in political parties, how people hustle

02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:50.640
[Guest]: for positions.

02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:53.680
[Guest]: For example, you feel it, because they genuinely are working hard, etc.

02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:55.440
[Guest]: But the competition is intense.

02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:59.760
[Guest]: Even for a party position, there are always dozens and dozens of claimants, which one

02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:03.760
[Guest]: wins depends not merely on whether you're good, it depends on your charisma, on your

02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:05.840
[Guest]: networking skills, things like that.

02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:09.680
[Guest]: This man had a focus, he tried to do something, but in other respects, perhaps he didn't have

02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:10.680
[Guest]: certain skills.

02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:13.840
[Guest]: You know, maybe it would have been wise to sell off that company at that time, use the

02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:17.880
[Guest]: money to become big and secure himself first and then give grand speeches and all of that

02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:18.880
[Amit Varma]: that may have secured his position.

02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:22.320
[Amit Varma]: Which is easy to say in hindsight, yeah, yeah, but at that time, he made the choice not to

02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:23.320
[Guest]: do it.

02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:26.400
[Guest]: And you know, he wasn't in that sense shrewd about his choices.

02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:30.760
[Guest]: He was determined and very idealistic and idealism can sometimes be very fatal.

02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:31.760
[Guest]: Is he remembered?

02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:32.760
[Guest]: In Tamil Nadu?

02:23:32.760 --> 02:23:33.760
[Guest]: Yes.

02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:34.760
[Guest]: After he, you know, passed away, etc.

02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:38.240
[Guest]: You know, after independence and all, they had a ship named after him and all of that.

02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:42.720
[Guest]: I think the port is now, you know, it commemorates him and all of that, but and that's hardly

02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:46.040
[Guest]: a consolation for a man who had to beg for 300 rupees, you know, you're right about

02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:49.520
[Amit Varma]: how to being one of the richest men in the South and you write about how he died in penury

02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:50.520
[Amit Varma]: in 1937.

02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:56.040
[Amit Varma]: And right at the end, he was reduced to selling his law books, which is kind of heartbreaking.

02:23:56.040 --> 02:23:57.760
[Amit Varma]: You know, I used to be a professional poker player.

02:23:57.760 --> 02:24:02.400
[Amit Varma]: And there was someone I used to know who was from this industrial family, who was a very

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:03.400
[Amit Varma]: bad player.

02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:04.400
[Amit Varma]: And it's a very sad story.

02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:06.200
[Amit Varma]: He basically lost everything in the last.

02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:10.360
[Amit Varma]: He got addicted to cocaine along the way and had a heart attack and all of that.

02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:13.840
[Amit Varma]: And the last I heard of him, he was selling his cutlery.

02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:18.720
[Amit Varma]: So it's kind of anyway, that is completely unrelated to this.

02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:22.040
[Amit Varma]: Much as you're used to historical time, I guess I've, you know, taken almost two and

02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:23.240
[Amit Varma]: a half hours of your time.

02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:29.840
[Amit Varma]: So I'll sort of talk about one final chapter, which seems very interesting and relevant

02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:33.920
[Amit Varma]: to me, which is a chapter called Savarkar's thwarted racial dream.

02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:39.240
[Amit Varma]: And in that you sort of talk about how at one point, Gandhi, who almost like so much

02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:46.240
[Amit Varma]: about Gandhi is loony, but at one point, Gandhi says that the Nizam of Hyderabad should be

02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:50.440
[Amit Varma]: a future emperor of United India when we get freedom from the British.

02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:54.080
[Amit Varma]: And to counter that, Vinayak Savarkar, who is, of course, the founder of Hindutva and

02:24:54.080 --> 02:25:00.120
[Amit Varma]: so on, comes up with his own vision for India, tell me a little bit about that.

02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:04.320
[Guest]: Yeah, I think the story is that some journalists asked Gandhi something about, you know, keeping

02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:05.320
[Guest]: India united, etc.

02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:09.400
[Guest]: And he said, it wouldn't matter, we can have a Muslim emperor, perhaps the Nizam of Hyderabad,

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:11.720
[Guest]: and that keeps the country together.

02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:13.320
[Guest]: And Savarkar gets very riled up with this.

02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:16.920
[Guest]: And he said, why should be the Nizam of Hyderabad, it should be the king of Nepal.

02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:21.560
[Guest]: Now, if you look at what's happening in Nepal, you know, the blood bath and the chaos in

02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:25.760
[Guest]: that country, the last thing you want is the Nepali royal family coming and becoming emperors

02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:27.400
[Guest]: of India of all places.

02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:32.080
[Guest]: But this was something Savarkar was very interested in, and actually does have some logic to it.

02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:37.120
[Guest]: He, for example, tried very hard throughout to link up all these princely states that

02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:40.200
[Guest]: existed in India, the Hindu princely states, because the thing was, the Hindu princely

02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:43.880
[Guest]: states were not directly ruled by the British, the royal families of Maharajas had plenty

02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:44.880
[Guest]: of money.

02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:48.160
[Guest]: So they could patronize a lot of Hindu Mahasabha meetings took place in princely states, because

02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:51.080
[Guest]: there was a constituency there, they were not under direct British oppression.

02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:54.880
[Guest]: And they had that sense of Indian culture, Hindu temples that they were protecting and

02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:55.880
[Guest]: all of that.

02:25:55.880 --> 02:26:01.000
[Guest]: So he wanted these Hindu princely states to become sort of laboratories for a future India,

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:05.480
[Guest]: where these Maharajas would train up little armies and make people virile and strong and

02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:07.080
[Guest]: all of that, and they would all unite.

02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:11.560
[Guest]: So his big theory was that the king of Nepal would come down with a big army and from across

02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:15.040
[Guest]: these princely states, a lot of these armies would these people would rise up and they'd

02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:19.320
[Guest]: all unite and create this this new India, defenders of the Hindu faith, defenders of

02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:20.320
[Guest]: the Hindu faith.

02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:24.520
[Guest]: I mean, it could have worked in some regards, because the Maharajas did try to interact.

02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:27.520
[Guest]: The Maharaja of Mysore was always desperate for Rajput brides from Rajputana.

02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:31.240
[Guest]: The Rajputs always saw the Maharaja of Mysore, South Indians is lower caste, so they didn't

02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:32.240
[Guest]: care.

02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:36.160
[Guest]: But and so he had to, Mysore had to make do with Kathiawar Gujarati Rajputs rather than

02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:38.400
[Guest]: the proper Rajputana ones.

02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:42.600
[Guest]: You know, there were the Padmanabhaswamy temple, the idol is made of Shaligramams that come

02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:43.600
[Guest]: from Nepal.

02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:47.520
[Guest]: So there are links between these states, one could see that there could be a few threads

02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:49.160
[Guest]: that you could investigate.

02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:52.240
[Guest]: But sadly, the Maharajas, most of them were not inspiring, they were all hanging about

02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:56.000
[Guest]: in Europe, they were doing their parties and their champagne and collecting Rolls Royces

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.840
[Guest]: and falling in love with white nurses and things like that.

02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:03.280
[Guest]: They were hardly going to rise up to Savarkar's grand vision to unite and sort of create a

02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:07.760
[Guest]: Hindu empire with the king of Nepal as their emperor, it was not going to happen.

02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:10.400
[Guest]: So yeah, it was, it was like, he, it's very interesting.

02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:15.600
[Guest]: He published this first as a, as an anonymous essay in a newspaper.

02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:19.760
[Guest]: So after I wrote about this, I got a shorter version of this as a column.

02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:23.720
[Guest]: And someone on Twitter, somebody said, you know, how do you know that person was Savarkar

02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:27.600
[Guest]: who wrote this anonymous article in this paper, but the advantage I have is that the same

02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:30.960
[Guest]: thing Savarkar published again in one of his books as an appendix.

02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:35.260
[Guest]: So you know, you know, it was him who wrote this, so it was a freak idea that he came

02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:36.520
[Guest]: up with.

02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:40.160
[Guest]: And it's interesting, it could potentially have led to something if the princes were

02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:44.560
[Guest]: actually invested in creating a Hindu state, sadly, the princes were not.

02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:47.760
[Amit Varma]: But the dream for a Hindu state seems to remain alive.

02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:52.440
[Amit Varma]: And this is sort of one of the themes that you touch upon in your book and in our conversations

02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:55.440
[Amit Varma]: about how history is not a clean linear thing.

02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:59.120
[Amit Varma]: This happens, that happens after that, and so on, just a link of cause and effect.

02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:01.280
[Amit Varma]: Instead, it's very messy and complex.

02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:05.360
[Amit Varma]: And there are all kinds of current simultaneously flowing together, each of them experiencing

02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:07.160
[Amit Varma]: their own ebb and flows.

02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:12.360
[Amit Varma]: And you could say that a sort of a certain current dominated in the decades before this

02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:14.000
[Amit Varma]: and after independence.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.560
[Amit Varma]: And you know, there's a lot of happenstance involved there as well.

02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:22.480
[Amit Varma]: But one current which was under the surface for a long time, and you know, has now kind

02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:27.840
[Amit Varma]: of come back and is almost this roaring wave around us, which is this this whole concept

02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:32.160
[Amit Varma]: of a sort of a Hindu nation, and so on and so forth.

02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:38.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, like looking back at it historically, do you think that it was inevitable that this

02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:42.440
[Amit Varma]: would arise again at some point, or is there just a lot of dumb luck in everything that

02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:43.440
[Amit Varma]: happens?

02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:49.240
[Guest]: You know, a lot of the resentment that is there is real, and perhaps even legitimate.

02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:52.720
[Guest]: What's interesting is that I don't think these people are saying we want a Hindu state.

02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:56.080
[Guest]: What they're saying is the existing state is not catering to what it promised.

02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:59.640
[Guest]: You know, at the end of the day, you've created secular institutions, you've created court

02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:01.440
[Guest]: systems, you've created a constitution.

02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:05.040
[Guest]: The Constitution is wonderful laws against untouchability, for example, but has it gone

02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:06.040
[Guest]: away?

02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:07.040
[Guest]: It hasn't.

02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:08.040
[Guest]: Courts exist.

02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:11.240
[Guest]: They're supposed to deliver swift justice, but the courts are jam packed like this slow,

02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:15.200
[Guest]: nothing moves to get one judgment, you spend about five, six years, 30 years of its property

02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:16.280
[Guest]: and things like that.

02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:17.280
[Guest]: It's not delivering.

02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:21.040
[Guest]: Plus, you have an English speaking class, that's something even Nehru warned against,

02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:24.360
[Guest]: Gandhiji warned against, they all warned against this new caste system where there's an English

02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:28.160
[Guest]: speaking elite that replaces the British and there's a large mass there.

02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:31.840
[Guest]: So secularism is an idea, for example, you can't impose from the top, it has to be cultivated

02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:34.920
[Guest]: slowly, it requires investment, which wasn't made.

02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:39.720
[Guest]: So it's likely that a lot of a state system is created, that's completely in many ways

02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:42.280
[Guest]: divorced from the realities on the ground.

02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:45.680
[Guest]: It's a little bit like saying you're taking secular irreligion and imposing it from the

02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:47.880
[Guest]: top on a very religious society.

02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:51.280
[Guest]: So there's bound to be some disappointments, some grievances there.

02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:56.360
[Guest]: I think the success of the majoritarian right has been in channeling that into their agenda.

02:29:56.360 --> 02:30:00.280
[Guest]: I don't think the people who are supporting them are entirely wedded to what they're saying.

02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:04.160
[Guest]: Tomorrow, if you give them a better narrative that addresses their grievances, that creates

02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:08.800
[Guest]: a space for their cultural ideas to also exist, they will easily perhaps change their mind.

02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:09.840
[Guest]: But that's not been done.

02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:12.680
[Guest]: That's not been done in a way that that is appealing, that works.

02:30:12.680 --> 02:30:16.360
[Amit Varma]: Are there models for that kind of an alternative narrative in our past?

02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:17.880
[Guest]: I think the past is a little more flexible.

02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:18.880
[Guest]: That's what I said.

02:30:18.880 --> 02:30:21.840
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at past kings, this is the thing, tradition is never timeless.

02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:23.760
[Guest]: Tradition always adjusts, it's always changing.

02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:27.160
[Guest]: It's always making room and responding to political changes.

02:30:27.160 --> 02:30:28.160
[Guest]: That's what you want.

02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:32.840
[Guest]: You can't rigidly, I mean, there's that Gandhi quote, right, spirit of consensus and compromise.

02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:37.080
[Guest]: Although he uses that in the context of caste, we have to realize that an idea will only

02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:41.280
[Guest]: have so much value if it's followed, if it actually appeals to the people who are meant

02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:42.280
[Guest]: to follow it.

02:30:42.280 --> 02:30:46.880
[Guest]: If you don't, and if you keep insisting on it, no matter how shrill you get delegitimized,

02:30:46.880 --> 02:30:49.960
[Guest]: someone else is going to come and come up with an idea that's probably worse, but sounds

02:30:49.960 --> 02:30:51.640
[Guest]: better and people will go there.

02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:55.320
[Guest]: So somewhere there has to be some sort of a consensus and a compromise.

02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:59.920
[Guest]: And that's why you know, I'm not very enamored of ultra leftist Twitter activists, for example,

02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:02.720
[Guest]: because that's equally unrealistic, which world are you living in?

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:05.920
[Guest]: It's very easy to say things on social media, you know, my father comes from an impoverished

02:31:05.920 --> 02:31:09.680
[Guest]: family in Kerala, he grew up as a son of an illiterate farmer, you know, I have cousins

02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:11.320
[Guest]: who are rickshaw drivers and so on.

02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:13.200
[Guest]: Their world is very different from mine, right?

02:31:13.200 --> 02:31:16.400
[Guest]: But I've seen it every summer, we would go there and we would see it.

02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:20.600
[Guest]: And that world, you can't go there with lofty constitutional values and so on, because the

02:31:20.600 --> 02:31:22.360
[Guest]: concerns are so different.

02:31:22.360 --> 02:31:25.880
[Guest]: You know, the concerns are so different that none of this addresses that when it doesn't

02:31:25.880 --> 02:31:30.760
[Guest]: address that, how are you expecting them to jump on board with your grand imagination

02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:34.720
[Guest]: for the nation, the idea of India, it has to take Indians along, if some Indians are

02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:39.320
[Guest]: not feeling wedded to the idea at all, we cannot write many essays as much as we want,

02:31:39.320 --> 02:31:40.680
[Guest]: but nobody's going to buy it.

02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:43.320
[Guest]: You and I will buy my book and talk about the idea of India, right?

02:31:43.320 --> 02:31:47.800
[Guest]: But other people who matter, following or even interested in it, no, because their ideas

02:31:47.800 --> 02:31:51.320
[Guest]: are different, and nobody's bothered to address it, except some of these people.

02:31:51.320 --> 02:31:57.120
[Guest]: Look at Kerala, the RSS is not becoming strong there, because people are wedded to RSS ideas.

02:31:57.120 --> 02:32:00.200
[Guest]: It's because every time you know, someone needs a government pension, there'll be an

02:32:00.200 --> 02:32:03.720
[Guest]: RSS man to take that lady, even in North India, they'll take them get that pension, get the

02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:08.280
[Guest]: paperwork done, all of that, they will help in a way that other people are not doing the

02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:09.280
[Amit Varma]: state one.

02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:11.360
[Guest]: Yeah, they're getting people ahead in some way.

02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:14.840
[Guest]: I was speaking to someone in Delhi, who is looking who's works in education.

02:32:14.840 --> 02:32:18.880
[Guest]: And I say, you know, asking about corruption, whether corruption has dropped UGC in this

02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:19.880
[Guest]: and that.

02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:23.720
[Guest]: And he said, there was a time when the Congress was in power, where it didn't matter what

02:32:23.720 --> 02:32:24.720
[Guest]: you did.

02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:26.720
[Guest]: So long as you delivered the money, you get approvals and things like that.

02:32:26.720 --> 02:32:29.720
[Guest]: Now, apparently, they'll at least check whether this is real.

02:32:29.720 --> 02:32:32.520
[Guest]: And there are apparently RSS middlemen who will sort it out for you.

02:32:32.520 --> 02:32:35.600
[Guest]: But first, they'll verify whether you're actually doing what you claim to do.

02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:38.200
[Guest]: So at the end of the day, you still have to pay the money, but they'll make sure that

02:32:38.200 --> 02:32:41.440
[Guest]: it's not some sort of blanket thing based solely on a price.

02:32:41.440 --> 02:32:45.680
[Guest]: So the thing is, these connections that they've cultivated to the root, look at the Congress

02:32:45.680 --> 02:32:48.880
[Guest]: Party, they've got enough leaders, but where are the grassroots workers, they've lost touch

02:32:48.880 --> 02:32:51.020
[Guest]: with what's happening on the ground.

02:32:51.020 --> 02:32:52.400
[Guest]: That is the real crisis.

02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:56.880
[Guest]: When we all sit on Twitter and social media and give sermons about what the right values

02:32:56.880 --> 02:33:00.600
[Guest]: of the country should be, we've not seen those people, you know, we've not seen the lives

02:33:00.600 --> 02:33:01.600
[Guest]: they lead.

02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:03.640
[Guest]: So you have to have patience for this sort of speech.

02:33:03.640 --> 02:33:06.240
[Guest]: It's I mean, you have to understand that it's a push and pull, obviously, at the end of

02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:07.240
[Guest]: the day.

02:33:07.240 --> 02:33:10.320
[Guest]: The end of the day, both sides have to give in some way or the other, you have to come

02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:12.480
[Guest]: to a place where both sides can go along together.

02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:17.560
[Guest]: Otherwise, we'll all live in our little, you know, ivory towers really, and you know, feel

02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:21.060
[Guest]: very grand about our superiority intellectually or whatever.

02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:24.600
[Guest]: But someone else is stealing the show and stealing the game, simply because they're

02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:26.680
[Amit Varma]: doing the heavy, heavy lifting and the hard work on the ground.

02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:30.120
[Amit Varma]: It carries a lot of resonance with me because like one of my favorite quotes is by Andrew

02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:33.360
[Amit Varma]: Breitbart, where he says politics is downstream of culture.

02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:38.480
[Amit Varma]: And I think a lot of the politics of the opposition today, especially the Congress Party is so

02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:42.440
[Amit Varma]: ineffectual, because it has no connect with what's happening in the culture.

02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:44.640
[Amit Varma]: And the BJP does for good or for bad.

02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:46.880
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, the culture is deeply complex.

02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:51.720
[Amit Varma]: So you know, maybe the BJP and the RSS have appealed to certain strands of it.

02:33:51.720 --> 02:33:54.520
[Amit Varma]: But that doesn't mean that better narratives can't be built.

02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:57.680
[Amit Varma]: And another thing thread that I found running through your book, and I made notes on it

02:33:57.680 --> 02:34:02.760
[Amit Varma]: as well, is that throughout the book, what we find is that at the political level, you

02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:07.320
[Amit Varma]: have these simplistic narratives being created, like even Shivaji creates us almost an early

02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:11.000
[Amit Varma]: Hindutva narrative of, you know, him as a defender of the Hindus and so on.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:15.120
[Amit Varma]: But the fact is that the facts are very different on the ground, the culture is very different.

02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:20.120
[Amit Varma]: There's so much assimilation happening within the culture, even as those in political power

02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:21.920
[Amit Varma]: create counter narratives to that.

02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:26.640
[Amit Varma]: So despite all of Shivaji's narratives, the truth is that when Afzal Khan came to meet

02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:31.520
[Amit Varma]: him, he had, like you said, Bhosle's and Kolpade's and so on in his army.

02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:36.440
[Amit Varma]: And the culture has always been deeper and richer than the politics is.

02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:39.040
[Amit Varma]: And is that a source for hope?

02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:40.040
[Guest]: I think it is.

02:34:40.040 --> 02:34:44.360
[Guest]: As I said, you know, when we shouldn't be despondent that so many people voted for a

02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:47.920
[Guest]: certain ideology or whatever, because I don't think they're voting for the ideology, right?

02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:51.200
[Guest]: New narratives can always be created, new ideas can always be created.

02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:54.440
[Guest]: But first, you have to know the people you're dealing with, you have to know what appeals

02:34:54.440 --> 02:34:57.640
[Guest]: to them, you have to understand what it is that they want to begin with, only then can

02:34:57.640 --> 02:34:58.640
[Guest]: you come up with a fresh vision.

02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:02.600
[Guest]: You know, if you're not even going to make the effort to understand who you're addressing,

02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:05.360
[Guest]: you don't know your audience, what are you going to speak to them?

02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:08.160
[Guest]: You know, you can sit on stage and speak, people will sit there and clap also, perhaps

02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:12.040
[Guest]: because they're polite, but that's not because they believe in what you're saying.

02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:15.680
[Guest]: You know, the Congress was genuinely certain that they would actually win a large number

02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:19.560
[Guest]: of seats, over 100 at least this time, because everywhere they went, large crowds, all of

02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:20.560
[Guest]: that.

02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:24.120
[Guest]: People come to see, but people are also intelligent, you know, they also understand these things.

02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:25.120
[Guest]: I think there's still hope.

02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:29.600
[Guest]: I think, I mean, obviously, there's fake news, there's disinformation, there's this cornering

02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:33.480
[Guest]: of the media, the media is bending over backwards to please certain people, etc.

02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:34.760
[Guest]: All of that is true.

02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:37.480
[Guest]: So even their victory owes a great deal to that.

02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:41.800
[Guest]: But all the same, another thing they haven't neglected is that staying in touch with, at

02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:43.120
[Guest]: the end of the day, the people on the ground.

02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:44.120
[Guest]: That's what Gandhi also did.

02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:47.840
[Guest]: You know, this is a country, people didn't have radios in those days, communication was

02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:51.040
[Guest]: weak, people spoke different languages, how did this man manage to unite so much of the

02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:56.360
[Guest]: country and we have recall value across the country, simply because he made the effort

02:35:56.360 --> 02:35:59.000
[Guest]: to go out there and figure out what they wanted.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:00.520
[Guest]: Everything he said, some of it was cuckoo.

02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:05.800
[Guest]: If you look at it in terms of logic and, you know, basic intelligence, but at that point,

02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:07.800
[Guest]: it needed to be said, perhaps, and he said it.

02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:11.200
[Guest]: So he'd bring people on board that way, one way or the other, and create a new narrative,

02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:13.600
[Guest]: a new option, a new vision or something.

02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:15.480
[Guest]: Right now, we don't have somebody to do that.

02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:20.480
[Guest]: There is one vision that is dominating, because it's done a good job of touching the grassroots,

02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:26.040
[Guest]: conquering, you know, the media space, making sure that the mainstream is in their hands.

02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:29.040
[Guest]: But the other side hasn't quite figured out because they've completely lost touch with

02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:30.040
[Guest]: everything that matters.

02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:33.800
[Amit Varma]: And I just kind of the process of getting back in touch with your own people and understanding

02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:38.240
[Amit Varma]: your culture doesn't only mean looking around you at the people around you and engaging

02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:40.920
[Amit Varma]: with them, but also studying the history of your country.

02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:45.280
[Amit Varma]: And I think a great start for all the listeners of the show would be to buy the courtesan

02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:47.080
[Amit Varma]: the Mahatma and the Italian Brahmin Manu.

02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:48.080
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much for coming.

02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:51.680
[Amit Varma]: Thank you very much for having me again.

02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:55.320
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoyed listening to this episode, hop on over to your nearest bookstore and

02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:59.700
[Amit Varma]: buy Manu Pillar's fantastic book, the courtesan, the Mahatma and the Italian Brahmin.

02:36:59.700 --> 02:37:03.680
[Amit Varma]: And while I am a Kindle evangelist, I would recommend that you buy the hard copies, it

02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:06.040
[Amit Varma]: comes in two covers, a white and a black one.

02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:10.320
[Amit Varma]: And the reason I recommend that is that the book is filled with fantastic illustrations

02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:17.160
[Amit Varma]: by Priya Kurian, and in my opinion, is a collector's item for that reason alone, do buy the book.

02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:23.480
[Amit Varma]: If you want to follow Manu on Twitter, hop on over to at Unumpillai, that's Manu reversed,

02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:24.480
