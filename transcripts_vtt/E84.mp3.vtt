[Unknown]: IVM

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.280
[Amit Varma]: Before you start listening to the scene in the unseen the hundredth episode of simplified

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.360
[Amit Varma]: Releases today and I am a guest on it simplified is an awesome show hosted by my good friends

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.000
[Amit Varma]: Naren Chuck and Shrikith check that out as well

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.600
[Amit Varma]: We speak about fake news in that show and now on with the scene in the unseen

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.960
[Amit Varma]: It is an accident of birth that I happened to be born right-handed

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.120
[Amit Varma]: I've spent no time wondering what life would be like if I was left-handed or ambidextrous

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.000
[Amit Varma]: Right-handed people left-handed people ambidextrous people all get treated more or less the same in India

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.400
[Amit Varma]: They're allowed to express a handedness as it were and they're not discriminated against in any way

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.000
[Amit Varma]: It's also an accident of birth that I happen to be born heterosexual

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.840
[Amit Varma]: Unlike that earlier accident of birth though. This is one with huge implications if I hadn't been born heterosexual

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.520
[Amit Varma]: I don't like the word straight because it implies that those who are not straight must be crooked in some way if I hadn't been

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.560
[Amit Varma]: Born heterosexual I would have grown up full of self-doubt about my own normalcy

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.120
[Amit Varma]: Feeling a guilt and fear and confusion that I should not have had to feel I can imagine

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.880
[Amit Varma]: What it must be to grow up left-handed I?

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.440
[Amit Varma]: Can empathize but I'm not sure I can imagine what it would have been like to grow up gay in India

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.440
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen our weekly podcast on economics politics and behavioral science

[Amit Varma]: And he is also an openly gay man whose work talks about what it is like to be gay

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
[Amit Varma]: His work talks about what it is like to grow up gay in India

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.440
[Amit Varma]: But that's not the only reason I invited him to be on this episode

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.440
[Amit Varma]: He also hosts a wonderful podcast which I often find poignant and also a laugh out loud funny in parts

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.440
[Amit Varma]: Called keeping it queer in which he talks to members of the queer community about their stories

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.440
[Amit Varma]: He's thus not just an artist in his own right but also someone who through this brilliant show

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.440
[Amit Varma]: Has drawn out different kinds of insight from a variety of gay people

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.440

[Amit Varma]: Naveen welcome to the scene and the unseen

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.440
[Guest]: I just felt like goosebumps going to my body when you were introducing me

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.440
[Guest]: Because I didn't realize I've done so much

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.440
[Guest]: And you made it sound like oh shit this guy's done all this work

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.440
[Guest]: I just like do things and some of them do you know end up becoming better

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.440
[Amit Varma]: No and you've actually done more than I mentioned because last week I saw your fantastic show The Good Child

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.440
[Amit Varma]: The special that you're touring around the country

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.440
[Guest]: And I'd encourage listeners to watch out for that because it's really good

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.440
[Amit Varma]: And I was very moved by it I expected it to be funny because I know you're a funny guy

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.440
[Amit Varma]: But I was also very moved by the arc of your story and sort of the various

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:12.440
[Amit Varma]: The sense that for someone growing up you know in a suburb of Bombay Bhaindar as it were

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.440
[Amit Varma]: You had not just one but various coming outs at different levels

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.440
[Unknown]: And the story touched me deeply

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.440
[Amit Varma]: So I want to sort of spend the first half of this podcast talking about your childhood

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.440
[Amit Varma]: Like you were you know you used to go to church regularly you were a master of ceremonies I think

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.440
[Guest]: Yeah yeah for the longest time before I got into comedy I spent from my board exams that were done

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.440
[Guest]: At 16 to like 23 I was just hosting events

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.440
[Guest]: Like you know comparing birthday parties, baptisms, communions, weddings, engagement all kinds of shit

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.440
[Guest]: Like you know I was always the guy there you know like and leading it

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.440
[Guest]: Not only just being a master of ceremony for the heck of it

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.440
[Guest]: I would like sit down with the family, plan together

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.440
[Guest]: And there were ladies in my church would see me working for the church

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.440
[Guest]: And they would like have dreams about me becoming a priest one day

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.440
[Guest]: Like that was intensely what they believed in

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.440
[Guest]: And then some of them would die the next month and my mom would be like

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.440
[Guest]: Oh they were like really having prophetic thoughts because they were going to pass away soon

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.440
[Guest]: I'm like mom calm down

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.440
[Guest]: But at the age of 13 I was genuinely interested in going for the church

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.440
[Guest]: Because at around the same time I realized what my orientation was

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.440
[Guest]: And at the same time you know like everybody around me was so Catholic

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.440
[Guest]: And we had such blinders on

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.440
[Guest]: I kind of believed that this is my destiny because if God did not want me to be like a married man

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.440
[Guest]: Then this is what he would give me to make me more in touch with him

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.440
[Guest]: So I would spend more time in the church by default

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.440
[Guest]: So all my skills from talking publicly to like being artistic in any kind of way

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.440
[Guest]: Be it music or being in the choir

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.440
[Guest]: It was all cultivated within the church but my world was only limited to that

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.440
[Guest]: And that's when the whole first coming out phase happened

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.440
[Guest]: Because I realized that there's a world outside

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.440
[Guest]: Which is like you know if you go to the better suburbs like Bandra and Andheri

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.440
[Guest]: There's an entire cultural hotspot that is being birthed and we are not a part of that

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.440
[Guest]: So I would go to this place called Haivankar and you know do open mics over there

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.440
[Guest]: And then by default meet more cooler people who were doing cool things you know

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.440
[Guest]: There were poets, filmmakers, artists of all sorts

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.440
[Guest]: And within this the first proper understanding happened of how much I was losing out

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.440
[Guest]: By just being in a very small community of people who were just like you know

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.440
[Guest]: Whenever you did something nice they patted you on the back but where would that lead to?

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.440
[Guest]: And in that understanding I learned more about what the church was not telling us you know

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.440
[Guest]: The whole pedophilia racket and what was happening back in our own playground

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.440
[Guest]: And my mom and I would have vehement arguments about that

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.440
[Guest]: So hence the concern of like ever coming to terms with my orientation

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.440
[Guest]: Was diminished because of the fact that I grew up in such a staunch community that would never accept me

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.440
[Guest]: And hence the walking away from the church happened like a little more drastically than I imagined

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.440
[Guest]: But it had to happen I feel

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.440
[Amit Varma]: But so take me a little back earlier in your childhood

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.440
[Amit Varma]: And again I should apologize in advance if my questions seem very ignorant or insensitive in any way

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.440
[Amit Varma]: Because I'm just coming from a position of pure curiosity

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.440
[Amit Varma]: And also you grew up in a different time than you know I'm a fair bit older than you

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.440
[Amit Varma]: And you're 26, I'm 44, I grew up in a different time

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.440
[Amit Varma]: So and it's very hard for me to sort of imagine your childhood

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.440
[Amit Varma]: So growing up as a young person in Bhaindar

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.440
[Amit Varma]: At a time where you didn't have so much access to the media and the internet

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.440
[Amit Varma]: And so much of gay culture coming in

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.440
[Guest]: Exactly

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.440
[Amit Varma]: How was it that like what was the process like of discovering that you're gay

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.440
[Amit Varma]: And then how do you come to terms with those feelings?

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.440
[Guest]: I was always a loner kid per se

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.440
[Guest]: Like when we moved, we moved a lot of houses when I was younger

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.440
[Guest]: Because my parents are first generation immigrants to Bombay

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.440
[Guest]: So we just had to like move and find our own place

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.440
[Guest]: So when we finally got our own apartment

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.440
[Guest]: We moved to Bhaindar and I was like 7

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.440
[Guest]: And a lot of friendships happened within the kindergarten to like the first 3 years of schooling

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.440
[Guest]: And the last like later years because you're friends in school

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.440
[Guest]: But I didn't have any of those friends

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.440
[Amit Varma]: And this would be like 1999-2000

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.440
[Guest]: 1998 yeah

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.440
[Guest]: So 1999 when we were like really properly settled down

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.440
[Guest]: My sisters were much older than me

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.440
[Guest]: So they would go to college and my mom and dad were both like working really hard

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.440
[Guest]: To like make sure we could make ends meet

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.440
[Guest]: So I was left alone in my own imaginary world

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.440
[Guest]: So like you know in a very Andy Kaufman-esque style

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.440
[Guest]: I would sit against the bed, look at the wall

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.440
[Guest]: And make my own you know like pictures and everything

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.440
[Guest]: So I was always into like creating drama and art and everything

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.440
[Guest]: In my own head I would write scripts and everything

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.440
[Guest]: I still got those scribble little notes of like my handwriting

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.440
[Guest]: I would read Tinkle comics and then try to adapt those stories to like real life

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.440
[Guest]: So all of that was like you know a small part of my life

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.440
[Guest]: And I had very good friends who would play like imaginary friends with me as well at the same time

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.440
[Guest]: So very close circuit

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.440
[Guest]: I lost one of my really dear friends to like a spinal problem that he had

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.440
[Guest]: And since then I became a little more detached

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.440
[Guest]: So we were three of us very close to each other

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.440
[Guest]: And one of them moved to Russia

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.440
[Guest]: And one of them passed away

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.440
[Guest]: So like I felt like a lot of my life was going to be

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.440
[Guest]: Losing friends on different levels

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.440
[Guest]: And that kind of is also a very common theme across my life

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.440
[Guest]: That I become close to people and they either move out, move away

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.440
[Guest]: Or just like stop existing sometimes

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.440
[Guest]: So I've dealt with that kind of thing you know

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.440
[Guest]: Like why make friends or why make family

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.440
[Guest]: When they're all going to just like walk away from you

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.440
[Guest]: So it became easy for me when I grew up to like

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.440
[Guest]: Detach myself in the whole coming out phase

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.440
[Guest]: Because I just felt that there was a threshold I had reached

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.440
[Guest]: And the whole emotional gush that happens when you're first understanding

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.440
[Guest]: That you are feeling differently than the others

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.440
[Guest]: You don't have anybody to tell you know

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.440
[Guest]: Like as I joke about in my bit

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.440
[Guest]: That I would go to the girls and we'd talk about Spice Girls and stuff like that

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.440
[Guest]: At the same time the boys would try to show me straight porn

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.440
[Guest]: And try to see if that works on me

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.440
[Guest]: So it's like it was always a pendulum of being confused about what it is

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.440
[Guest]: And why are they feeling differently

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.440
[Guest]: Like you know like a boy and a girl would hold hands

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.440
[Guest]: And I would want that but not with a girl

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.440
[Guest]: You know like it's all kinds of weird thoughts and brainwaves

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.440
[Guest]: That you don't know how to define

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.440
[Guest]: And hence it's very important to understand at an early age

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.440
[Guest]: And in my travels I've figured out that a lot of schools

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.440
[Guest]: Not only just like better schools that are internationally controlled or whatever

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.440
[Guest]: Even the low level schools that are state run

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.440
[Guest]: Are now teaching kids about same sex relationships

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.440
[Guest]: Which is important because if there was somebody out there

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.440
[Guest]: Telling me it was okay back when I was 13 or 14

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.440
[Guest]: It would have been cool

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.440
[Guest]: I remember we did have a sex education class

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.440
[Guest]: And my ma'am clearly said that you know like

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.440
[Guest]: Because it's difficult to pass a hard stool

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.440
[Guest]: Imagine how painful anal sex is

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.440
[Guest]: And that's the only statement she said about gay sex

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.440
[Guest]: And I'm just like scratching my head waiting

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.440
[Guest]: Tell me more, I'm having all these feelings

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.440
[Guest]: And nothing is being answered

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.440
[Amit Varma]: She must have a raunchy life

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.440
[Amit Varma]: So basically you didn't have a framework

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.440
[Amit Varma]: Where you could put the way you were feeling

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.440
[Amit Varma]: It was just that you were different and you couldn't understand why

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.440
[Guest]: Nothing, nothing

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.440
[Guest]: I was like told that there's a word for it called Baila

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.440
[Guest]: Which is very commonly used in Bombay

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.440
[Guest]: Baila is like womanesque

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.440
[Guest]: So if you have a limp arm and if you behave a certain way

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.440
[Guest]: If your hips are whatever

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.440
[Guest]: You know if you do all of that

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.440
[Guest]: And that's again the picture Bollywood paints

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.440
[Unknown]: And we understand that

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.440
[Guest]: I remember when I was younger

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.440
[Guest]: I loved some of these movies that had a stereotypical gay character

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.440
[Guest]: And I'm like I'm not relating to this either

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.440
[Guest]: This is not me

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.440
[Guest]: So what is this definition that I'm trying to find

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.440
[Guest]: And hence getting access to Facebook and social media

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.440
[Guest]: Became very handy around when I was 17 or 18

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.440
[Guest]: I would go to cyber cafes and then sit and like you know

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.440
[Guest]: Start looking up shit

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.440
[Guest]: So on Awkward there were a lot of communities

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.440
[Guest]: A lot of gay communities that would have like chat rooms

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.440
[Guest]: And you couldn't talk to people who were counsellors

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.440
[Guest]: Yahoo Messenger happened

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.440
[Guest]: The whole ISL generation that we were exposed to

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.440
[Guest]: Was really handy for like people who were gay to communicate with each other

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.440
[Guest]: We sometimes look at internet as a very bad place

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.440
[Guest]: Because of how you can you know fall in trouble

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.440
[Guest]: But for a lot of gay youngsters

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.440
[Guest]: It becomes a very key factor in determining who they are

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.440
[Guest]: By talking to people who are the same you know

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.440
[Guest]: Like I made a pseudo account on Facebook

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.440
[Guest]: And I'm kind of proud of that

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.440
[Guest]: Because I would like go and talk to people from UK, US, Australia

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.440
[Guest]: Who were openly gay and you know

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.440
[Guest]: They were not ashamed of who they were

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.440
[Guest]: And they would talk to me about

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.440
[Guest]: How they're settling down with their partners

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.440
[Guest]: How marriages are still you know difficult to get in some parts

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.440
[Guest]: How they're hoping to find licenses

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.440
[Guest]: And all of that kind of inspired me to like then talk about it

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.440
[Guest]: I remember because in the article I talk about

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.440
[Guest]: The man I dated when I was 19

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.440
[Guest]: Who was 40 and we were you know like

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.440
[Guest]: Almost like two generations apart

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.440
[Guest]: But I still would sit down at a cafe with him

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.440
[Guest]: And tell him that you know

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.440
[Guest]: I would think about coming out

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.440
[Guest]: Because you know the world is so amazing

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.440
[Guest]: I want to come out

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.440
[Guest]: I want to talk about this

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.440
[Guest]: Be an activist

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.440
[Guest]: Try to figure out

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.440
[Guest]: How we can get more people like us to open up

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.440
[Guest]: Because there was clearly a market of people talking

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.440
[Guest]: Very hush hush you know

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.440
[Guest]: Behind these chat rooms

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.440
[Guest]: Why can't we bring them out in the open

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.440
[Guest]: And then I understood why we can't

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.440
[Guest]: Because then I figured out

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.440
[Guest]: How difficult life is as a gay man

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.440
[Guest]: So then the whole you know

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.440
[Amit Varma]: Internet factor happened

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.440
[Amit Varma]: You know in one of the conversations that I've heard of yours

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.440
[Amit Varma]: You talk about how you first came out

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.440
[Amit Varma]: To your close friend Amit

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.440
[Amit Varma]: Who was one of the three friends

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.440
[Amit Varma]: And the other one passed away

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.440
[Amit Varma]: And Amit went to Russia

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.440
[Amit Varma]: And you know

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.440
[Amit Varma]: And that was a very interesting story

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.440
[Amit Varma]: And is that the first time you were coming out to someone?

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.440
[Guest]: Exactly

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.440
[Guest]: No one knew before that

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.440
[Guest]: No one literally had any idea

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.440
[Guest]: And I remember

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.440
[Guest]: I was talking to my Canadian friend Richard

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.440
[Guest]: And he was like you know

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.440
[Guest]: If you want to tell somebody

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440
[Guest]: Tell somebody who's grown up with you

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.440
[Guest]: So you can always confide in them

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.440
[Guest]: And based on how they react

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.440
[Guest]: You'll know how it's going to be further on

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.440
[Guest]: And both Amit and I

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.440
[Guest]: Come from very impoverished backgrounds

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.440
[Guest]: But with dreams of doing a lot of things

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.440
[Guest]: We were very inspired by

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.440
[Guest]: Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440
[Guest]: Those kind of you know

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.440
[Guest]: Kid stories who would run away

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.440
[Guest]: And find their own new world

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.440
[Guest]: Because his family was very difficult to him

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.440
[Guest]: His father was a drunkard

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.440
[Guest]: And his mom got some back stuff

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.440
[Guest]: Injuries and stuff like that

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.440
[Guest]: So he had to really work

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.440
[Guest]: His entire life

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.440
[Guest]: So much so that

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.440
[Guest]: He accumulated all this money

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.440
[Guest]: Just to go and study abroad

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.440
[Guest]: But he wouldn't tell me

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.440
[Guest]: That he's leaving

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.440
[Guest]: Until like my last day of exams

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.440
[Guest]: Because he knew I would

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.440
[Guest]: F*** exams up

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.440
[Guest]: If he let me know beforehand

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.440
[Guest]: Because we had that kind of

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.440
[Guest]: Strong friendship you know

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.440
[Guest]: Even thinking about that

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.440
[Guest]: Is kind of emotional for me

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.440
[Guest]: But he's such kind of friend

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.440
[Guest]: That he would like

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.440
[Guest]: Have your back all the time

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.440
[Guest]: I'm like okay

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.440
[Guest]: I can tell him right now

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.440
[Guest]: And it was like a lot of preparation

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.440
[Guest]: We used to go out

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.440
[Guest]: On evening walks every day

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.440
[Guest]: We have this small

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.440
[Guest]: Little creek in Bayantar

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.440
[Guest]: Like say what you may

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.440
[Guest]: About Bayantar and its population

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.440
[Guest]: There's a nice little creek over there

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.440
[Guest]: Where you can

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.440
[Guest]: Really enjoy the sea breeze

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.440
[Guest]: And landings over there

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.440
[Guest]: And you can then

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.440
[Guest]: Look at Vasya

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.440
[Guest]: And laugh at them

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.440
[Amit Varma]: So

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.440
[Amit Varma]: So

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.440
[Amit Varma]: People in Bayantar

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.440
[Amit Varma]: Laughing at someone

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.440
[Guest]: That's life

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.440
[Guest]: That's how you cooperate

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.440
[Guest]: Right

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.440
[Guest]: And so we would like

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.440
[Guest]: Think of one day

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.440
[Guest]: Crossing the creek

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.440
[Guest]: On our own little boat

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.440
[Guest]: And shit like that

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.440
[Guest]: Very very like

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.440
[Guest]: Gay stuff

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.440
[Guest]: If I may say so myself

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.440
[Guest]: And

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.440
[Guest]: And

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.440
[Guest]: Then like he said

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.440
[Guest]: Okay I'm moving to Russia

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.440
[Guest]: And I was kind of like

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.440
[Guest]: Very taken aback by that

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.440
[Guest]: I'm like oh my god

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.440
[Guest]: All these dreams we had

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.440
[Guest]: And all these

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.440
[Guest]: Advances we want to go to

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.440
[Guest]: But that was afterwards

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.440
[Guest]: Before that

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.440
[Guest]: I had to

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.440
[Guest]: Tell him about myself

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.440
[Guest]: And we went on

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.440
[Guest]: A nice little walk

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.440
[Guest]: And I built up to it

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.440
[Guest]: And

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.440
[Guest]: And it almost

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.440
[Guest]: Very naturally happened

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.440
[Guest]: When I told him

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.440
[Guest]: There was no

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.440
[Guest]: Pretence

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.440
[Guest]: Or there was no

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.440
[Guest]: Beating around the bush

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.440
[Guest]: And he just asked me

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.440
[Guest]: Did you ever get hurt

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.440
[Guest]: Like in some way

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.440
[Guest]: Like physically

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.440
[Guest]: Did someone assault you

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.440
[Guest]: Or whatever

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.440
[Guest]: So I was like

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.440
[Guest]: No there's nothing

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.440
[Guest]: Like that behind that

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.440
[Guest]: It's just like

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.440
[Guest]: I felt this way

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.440
[Guest]: And

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.440
[Guest]: I would like

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.440
[Guest]: Ask him a lot of times

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.440
[Guest]: And

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.440
[Guest]: Based on that

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.440
[Guest]: I would gauge

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.440
[Guest]: My friend's reaction

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.440
[Guest]: To see how much

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.440
[Guest]: They'd be okay with a man

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.440
[Guest]: Who's gay

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.440
[Guest]: And in their friend circle

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.440
[Guest]: Because if their

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.440
[Guest]: First image is someone

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.440
[Guest]: Touching them wrongly

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.440
[Guest]: In the train

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.440
[Guest]: Then they always have

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.440
[Guest]: That kind of fear

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.440
[Guest]: In real life as well

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.440
[Guest]: So you have to really

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.440
[Guest]: Calm them down

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.440
[Guest]: And make them know

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.440
[Guest]: That it's okay

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.440
[Guest]: We're all the same

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.440
[Guest]: And hence this happened

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.440
[Guest]: So he mulled over it

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.440
[Guest]: Overnight

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.440
[Guest]: Next day when he walked

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.440
[Guest]: He's like

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.440
[Guest]: It's okay

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.440
[Guest]: I read about it

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.440
[Guest]: It's all cool

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.440
[Guest]: Don't worry

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.440
[Guest]: It's cool to come on board

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.440
[Guest]: So when that

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.440
[Guest]: First acceptance

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.440
[Guest]: Happened that

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440
[Guest]: Beautifully

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.440
[Guest]: There was no

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.440
[Guest]: Going back and forth

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.440
[Guest]: With that

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.440
[Guest]: I felt okay

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.440
[Guest]: This seems normal

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.440
[Guest]: So I can tell more friends

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.440
[Guest]: So we told one more

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.440
[Guest]: Friend of mine

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.440
[Guest]: Gaurav

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.440
[Guest]: And from there

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.440
[Guest]: My circle became

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.440
[Guest]: Bigger and bigger

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.440
[Guest]: And my support system

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.440
[Guest]: Initially was very strong

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.440
[Guest]: And some of them

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.440
[Guest]: Would sometimes laugh

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.440
[Guest]: And make fun

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.440
[Guest]: And everything

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.440
[Guest]: But I knew

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.440
[Guest]: They were doing it

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.440
[Guest]: In jest

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.440
[Guest]: Not so much

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.440
[Guest]: To insult me

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.440
[Guest]: Like one guy

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.440
[Guest]: You know

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.440
[Guest]: It's not

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.440
[Amit Varma]: I am funny

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.440
[Amit Varma]: At other times

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440
[Amit Varma]: You should see me in bed

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.440
[Guest]: So like that

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.440
[Guest]: So I had to

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.440
[Guest]: Be very patient

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.440
[Guest]: With all these friends

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.440
[Guest]: And they came around

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.440
[Guest]: In their own beautiful way

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.440
[Guest]: And I've had the most

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.440
[Guest]: Amazing learning

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.440
[Guest]: From this that

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.440
[Guest]: You know

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.440
[Guest]: If you are

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.440
[Guest]: Who you are

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.440
[Guest]: And if you really

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.440
[Guest]: Own up to it

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.440
[Guest]: Then nothing's

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.440
[Guest]: Gonna stop you

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.440
[Guest]: Even though

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.440
[Guest]: Some people

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.440
[Guest]: Say they hate

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.440
[Guest]: Certain flamboyance

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.440
[Guest]: In their life or whatever

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.440
[Guest]: It's true to an extent

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.440
[Guest]: But beyond that

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440
[Guest]: There will always be

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.440
[Guest]: People who have your back

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.440
[Guest]: I think that's one

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.440
[Guest]: Learning from all

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.440
[Guest]: The coming out stories

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.440
[Guest]: I've heard

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.440
[Guest]: That we eventually

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.440
[Guest]: End up finding

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.440
[Guest]: Our own families

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.440
[Amit Varma]: In our own beautiful ways

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.440
[Amit Varma]: So there's nothing

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.440
[Amit Varma]: Stopping you

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.440
[Amit Varma]: And these are people

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.440
[Amit Varma]: Who've kind of

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.440
[Unknown]: Grown up with you

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.440
[Amit Varma]: And known you

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.440
[Amit Varma]: And you know

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.440
[Amit Varma]: Been to school

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.440
[Amit Varma]: College with you

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.440
[Guest]: So it's a

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.440
[Guest]: Different matter

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.440
[Amit Varma]: They already know

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.440
[Amit Varma]: Who you are

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.440
[Amit Varma]: And they don't

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.440
[Amit Varma]: Apply those

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.440
[Amit Varma]: Instinctive stereotypes

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.440
[Amit Varma]: To you

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.440
[Amit Varma]: But apart from that

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.440
[Amit Varma]: You know

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.440
[Amit Varma]: Did you sense

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.440
[Amit Varma]: That it's a problem?

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.440
[Guest]: Well like

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.440
[Guest]: There's always

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.440
[Guest]: A certain level of

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.440
[Guest]: You know

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.440
[Guest]: Mental blockage

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.440
[Guest]: That people have

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.440
[Guest]: When they talk to you

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.440
[Guest]: So they have

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.440
[Guest]: Curiosity

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.440
[Guest]: And I think

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.440
[Guest]: In a modern workplace

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.440
[Guest]: In Bombay at least

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.440
[Guest]: When you go and work

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.440
[Guest]: And you're open

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.440
[Guest]: About your orientation

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.440
[Guest]: No one really

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.440
[Guest]: Bothers you as such

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.440
[Guest]: There's no

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.440
[Guest]: Backlash

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.440
[Guest]: So to say

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.440
[Guest]: Nothing that I've felt

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.440
[Guest]: In fact

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.440
[Guest]: Because me working

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440
[Guest]: At IVM was because

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.440
[Guest]: Of the fact that

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.440
[Guest]: I was very strongly

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.440
[Guest]: Talking about this

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.440
[Guest]: And it was

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.440
[Guest]: Like a mouthpiece

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.440
[Guest]: For me to channel

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.440
[Guest]: My energies

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.440
[Guest]: Into researching

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.440
[Guest]: More into this

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.440
[Guest]: Instead of just

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.440
[Guest]: Assuming everything is okay

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.440
[Guest]: So that's why

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.440
[Guest]: I feel that

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.440
[Guest]: It's important to have

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.440
[Guest]: An openness to your

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.440
[Guest]: Colleagues as well

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.440
[Guest]: Because then

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.440
[Guest]: They'll have

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.440
[Guest]: Dumb questions

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.440
[Guest]: Just answer those

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.440
[Guest]: Questions and move on

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.440
[Guest]: You know

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.440
[Guest]: And then you can

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.440
[Guest]: Have the same kind

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.440
[Guest]: Of conversation

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.440
[Guest]: That you have

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.440
[Guest]: With someone

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.440
[Guest]: For example

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.440
[Guest]: If your colleague's

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.440
[Guest]: Like hey my husband's

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.440
[Guest]: Not in a mood today

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.440
[Guest]: Or whatever

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.440
[Guest]: It's my gay story

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.440
[Guest]: You know

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.440
[Guest]: Like I want a normalcy

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.440
[Guest]: At every level

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.440
[Guest]: And that

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.440
[Guest]: We are still reaching

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.440
[Guest]: To that point

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.440
[Amit Varma]: Slowly and steadily

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.440
[Amit Varma]: But

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.440
[Guest]: And maybe you're lucky

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.440
[Guest]: To be in Bombay also

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.440
[Guest]: I imagine in a small town

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.440
[Guest]: I think yeah

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.440
[Guest]: We have to check

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.440
[Guest]: Our privileges

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.440
[Guest]: When it comes to this

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.440
[Guest]: It's much more

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.440
[Guest]: Difficult in smaller

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.440
[Guest]: Parts and pockets

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.440
[Guest]: But even

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.440
[Guest]: Some of the men

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.440
[Guest]: I've dated in the past

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.440
[Guest]: They're all working

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.440
[Guest]: In their own little spaces

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.440
[Guest]: Right

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.440
[Guest]: So

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440
[Guest]: Despite the industry

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.440
[Guest]: That they're working in

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440
[Guest]: They always find

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.440
[Guest]: A way to

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.440
[Guest]: Talk about it

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.440
[Guest]: You can always have

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.440
[Guest]: A small pocket

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.440
[Guest]: That you can always

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.440
[Guest]: Talk to

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.440
[Guest]: Because

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.440
[Guest]: You need that

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.440
[Guest]: Immediate support system

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.440
[Guest]: If you're going to work

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.440
[Guest]: Like 14 or 15 hours

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440
[Guest]: Of your day

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.440
[Guest]: Find people who can

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.440
[Guest]: Understand what you're

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.440
[Guest]: Going through

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.440
[Guest]: Because if you're

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.440
[Guest]: Going to suffocate

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.440
[Guest]: On that very fact

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.440
[Guest]: For the longest time

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.440
[Guest]: It's going to be difficult

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.440
[Guest]: Because I remember

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.440
[Guest]: I was watching Milk

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.440
[Guest]: Which is a biography

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.440
[Guest]: On Harvey Milk

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440
[Guest]: And

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.440
[Guest]: After like

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.440
[Guest]: Losing consecutively

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.440
[Guest]: For 2-3 times

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.440
[Guest]: For the parliament

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.440
[Guest]: And

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.440
[Guest]: You know

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.440
[Guest]: People who we knew

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.440
[Guest]: Who were gay

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.440
[Guest]: Just go out and

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.440
[Guest]: Come out

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.440
[Guest]: Because

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.440
[Guest]: You know

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.440
[Guest]: People who know you

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.440
[Guest]: Will again

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.440
[Guest]: Like care for you

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.440
[Guest]: Because they know you

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.440
[Guest]: And they work for you

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.440
[Guest]: Or they work with you

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.440
[Guest]: Or they understand

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.440
[Guest]: What your lifestyle is

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.440
[Guest]: Only after you

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.440
[Guest]: Really come out

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.440
[Guest]: And you have to show

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.440
[Guest]: That you're not

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.440
[Guest]: A minority anymore

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.440
[Guest]: And

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.440
[Guest]: I know it's a

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.440
[Guest]: Different experience

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.440
[Guest]: When you're coming out

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.440
[Guest]: To a larger chunk

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.440
[Guest]: Of people

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.440
[Guest]: But

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.440
[Unknown]: I think there is

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.440
[Guest]: In 2013

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.440
[Guest]: We saw a general rise

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440
[Guest]: In coming out stories

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.440
[Guest]: Couples living

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.440
[Guest]: Couples

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.440
[Guest]: You know

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.440
[Guest]: Posting photos together

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.440
[Guest]: And that is empowering

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.440
[Guest]: In it's own way

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.440
[Guest]: So I think we need

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.440
[Guest]: More of that

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.440
[Guest]: In the current time and age

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.440
[Guest]: Because again

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.440
[Guest]: We're fighting a regime

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.440
[Guest]: That does not care about us

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.440
[Guest]: When the supreme court

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.440
[Guest]: Asked the government

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.440
[Guest]: For an opinion

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.440
[Guest]: On section 377

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.440
[Guest]: This time around

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.440
[Guest]: They said

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.440
[Guest]: You know what

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.440
[Guest]: Do what you want to do

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.440
[Guest]: We don't care

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.440
[Guest]: That's the tone

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.440
[Guest]: That they're conveying

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.440
[Guest]: Every time

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.440
[Amit Varma]: So I wonder

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.440
[Amit Varma]: How much longer

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.440
[Amit Varma]: Will it last

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.440
[Amit Varma]: And

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.440
[Amit Varma]: How much longer

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.440
[Amit Varma]: Will there be

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.440
[Amit Varma]: We need to

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.440
[Amit Varma]: Act

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.440
[Amit Varma]: Now

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.440
[Amit Varma]: And

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.440
[Amit Varma]: We can

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.440
[Amit Varma]: Not

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.440
[Amit Varma]: Do this

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.440
[Amit Varma]: And

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.440
[Amit Varma]: We must

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.440
[Amit Varma]: Act

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.440
[Amit Varma]: Now

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.440
[Unknown]: Before

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:25.440
[Amit Varma]: We

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.440
[Amit Varma]: Can

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.440
[Guest]: Not

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.440
[Guest]: Do this

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.440
[Guest]: And

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.440
[Guest]: We must

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.440
[Guest]: We need

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.440
[Guest]: To

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.440
[Guest]: Act

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.440
[Guest]: Now

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.440
[Guest]: And

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.440
[Guest]: We must

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440
[Guest]: Act

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.440
[Guest]: Now

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.960
[Guest]: and you know you have to really like invest your time and I would like pick jobs that

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.760
[Guest]: would allow me to like leave early at 7.30ish and then run to a mic and do one or two open

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.760
[Guest]: mics in the evening.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.400
[Guest]: So every night I would go and I would do this material about what's it like coming out you

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.720
[Guest]: know and one advice I got as a comic was to stick to the material I'm doing for the first

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:04.080
[Guest]: six months, do that same four minutes everywhere so you can understand how that evolves automatically,

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.640
[Guest]: what funny bits remain and stuff like that.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.360
[Guest]: And for the first six months I was mainly bombing with that material you know so it

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:16.200
[Guest]: became very difficult for me to like get spots and stuff like that and a lot of older comics

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.480
[Guest]: like Sapan Verma, Kunal Kamra and Zakir and Biswa would advise me to stick to it you know

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.600
[Guest]: don't don't change the narrative just because some jokes are not working because you have

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:29.320
[Guest]: a really strong idea of how you want to build this material.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.040
[Guest]: So I would do that so from there it became easier for me to like channel my energy into

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.760
[Guest]: writing better material and you know you transition from the four minute phase to six minutes

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.160
[Guest]: and eight minutes and then 15 and stuff like that.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.080
[Guest]: So I was working at Hive, I was writing comedy, I was doing some writing work on the side

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.080
[Guest]: as well.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:49.200
[Guest]: All of this was going well and I was creating queer content so to say on my own.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.120
[Guest]: We would do a small mic called the rainbow mic in Hive which was like calling all the

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.760
[Guest]: queer contestants to come and do whatever they wanted.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:04.400
[Guest]: Some would like recite poetry, storytelling, dancing, you know slam poetry, comedy as well.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.600
[Guest]: So all kinds of queer performers were given a chance to like do their work.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.280
[Guest]: So that's when I found like oh my god there's an entire little undercircuit that we're building

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.960
[Guest]: and we're not even realizing that this is a movement on its own you know.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.720
[Guest]: And there was not much happening as I said there was like always the gay party scene

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:24.500
[Guest]: but culturally for like the queers in Bombay and other metropolitan cities not much was

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.280
[Guest]: happening as much as I wanted to you know see.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.700
[Guest]: So we were doing the small little thing and from there I began again like you know questioning

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.960
[Guest]: whether like sooner or later will they find out because I now had half an hour of material

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.920
[Guest]: about coming out and my friends and homophobic.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.800
[Amit Varma]: And was any of it on YouTube or anything?

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.800
[Amit Varma]: Not yet.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.040
[Guest]: There was only like some bits of it like here and there.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.480
[Guest]: Somebody lost my footage also which was I think thankful because back then I was not

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.240
[Guest]: ready for that footage to come out.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.520
[Guest]: And there was another comic called Nick Pillow who's a white guy who's been teaching drama

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.040
[Guest]: in Bombay for the longest time.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.440
[Guest]: So somebody told me he's also a queer comic.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:06.440
[Guest]: So we came together and did a show called Homo's Odyssey which again a pun on Homo's

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.440
[Guest]: Odyssey.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.440
[Guest]: You like puns.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.440
[Guest]: I love puns.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.080
[Guest]: And so Homo's Odyssey became like this one two person show where you know do a lot of

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:19.240
[Guest]: little acts together like we would do small sketches interspersed with a stand up as well.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.800
[Guest]: And might I say the first stand up comedy kiss on stage.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.800
[Unknown]: Oh wow.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.800
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.800
[Guest]: We do have photos to prove but we can't put it online.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.600
[Guest]: But we went there.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.760
[Guest]: We actually wanted to like you know take it a little more like how much can people see

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.240
[Guest]: two men kissing on stage and be uncomfortable.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.600
[Guest]: That sort of stuff.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.360
[Guest]: And then Nick moved on with his life.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.440
[Guest]: He's now engaged and going to get married.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.960
[Guest]: And then I was like okay now I have to do my show.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.160
[Guest]: I have to still proceed with my material.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:49.000
[Guest]: And I ended up doing Coming Out Soon which was a trial show.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.440
[Amit Varma]: And that was like again which morphed into The Good Child which I saw last week.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:58.200
[Guest]: But throughout this I remember Sharon who's the co-founder of The Hive and now Ku Klub.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.280
[Guest]: I was talking to her and she's like you know what dude two years of comedy and you've been

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.760
[Guest]: doing so much work with the LGBT stuff.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.760
[Guest]: When will you tell your parents?

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.760
[Guest]: And I'm like that's a legit question Sharon.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.280
[Guest]: I can't I can't imagine.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.560
[Guest]: And hence like as I told you like I had to come out on different levels.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.960
[Guest]: So after engineering I quit and became a writer and then after that I became an atheist as

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.080
[Guest]: I told you.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.520
[Guest]: So there were already like too many blows I was giving out to my family which was staunchly

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.520
[Amit Varma]: conservative.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.520
[Amit Varma]: Like both my sisters are married.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about these different blows.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.520
[Guest]: How did they go down?

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:33.080
[Guest]: Like always like dramatically like it's it's not easy like I remember the way I left L&T

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.520
[Guest]: was like which the company I was hired to work for.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.520
[Amit Varma]: You're an engineer.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.520
[Guest]: I'm an engineer.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.600
[Guest]: Telecom engineer by qualification.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.600
[Guest]: But I got placed in Larsen and Toubro Infotech which is IT and I don't know IT.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.720
[Guest]: And they're trying to like teach me programming and coding and I'm just dyslexic when it comes

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.220
[Unknown]: to like coding.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.440
[Guest]: So I left after two weeks.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:57.240
[Guest]: I still got a small paycheck and I was like I came home and mom's like tomorrow what time

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.240
[Guest]: do you have to go to work?

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.240
[Guest]: I'm like I'm not going.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.240
[Guest]: She's like why?

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.240
[Guest]: I'm like I just quit.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.880
[Guest]: I did not want to do this.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:07.920
[Guest]: And then just like became like an entire silent period for my father was like no talking for

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.520
[Guest]: three months and just like cold hearted like you know stone cold treatment.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.040
[Guest]: And mom was still like have you figured out what you want to do and all that.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:22.440
[Guest]: And I remember the last day of not the last day but like they had to give us a test to

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.680
[Guest]: pass us and see how we can fare for three months and then they give us jobs right.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.320
[Guest]: So when everybody else was studying I was sitting and writing a poem which I called

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.320
[Guest]: across the bridge which was like a very metaphorical.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.720
[Amit Varma]: Did you have it on you?

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720
[Guest]: I do.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.720
[Guest]: One second.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.480
[Guest]: So this is a very rhyme to rhyme kind of poem but here's what it says.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.160
[Guest]: There's a boat in the river at the edge of the ridge.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.320
[Guest]: The boatman beckons to take you across the bridge.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.480
[Guest]: You've heard about the other side.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.800
[Guest]: You know it's bright and lovely.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.740
[Guest]: You stand at the edge and ponder if it's worth being sad and lonely.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.740
[Guest]: You make a decision.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.120
[Guest]: You take the leap.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.120
[Guest]: You land on the boat.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.680
[Guest]: The edge though steep.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.680
[Guest]: The currents are strong.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.040
[Guest]: The journey is tough.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.040
[Guest]: The water is coarse.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.040
[Guest]: It's choppy.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.040
[Guest]: It's rough.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.040
[Guest]: You're scared to cross.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.400
[Guest]: Now you risk a glance.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.080
[Guest]: Your friends and family say you've missed your chance.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.680
[Guest]: The chance to stick to the regular show, the chance to be ordinary and cheat your core.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.200
[Guest]: The belief it surges and so does the wave.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.200
[Guest]: You don't need to look back.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.720
[Guest]: You're far too brave.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.720
[Guest]: The storm descends.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.960
[Guest]: The boat sails calm.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960
[Guest]: The bridge it passes.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.840
[Guest]: You're befuddled with charm.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.840
[Guest]: The other shore arrives.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.080
[Guest]: You begin to strut.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.120
[Guest]: You know now the journey was tough but worth.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.760
[Guest]: The loneliness has vanished.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.320
[Guest]: You're relieved and glad.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.600
[Guest]: The past won't haunt you now.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.960
[Guest]: The past you once had.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.960
[Amit Varma]: Lovely.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.800
[Amit Varma]: And you were writing this while during that last run too, bro?

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.840
[Guest]: Yeah, study break.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.560
[Guest]: And then they threw me out as they should have.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.400
[Guest]: And then like, you know, they didn't talk to me for a while.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.720
[Guest]: My mom and dad were really like upset about it.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.160
[Guest]: I just looked up like writing jobs available for the for the lowest amount of money I could

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.160
[Guest]: work for.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.800
[Guest]: And I got a content writing job, which was like nice and you know, I had to write product

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.720
[Guest]: descriptions for like Amazon and Jabang and all these websites.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:07.400
[Guest]: So that was fun, not too extensive, like they would give us like some 20 products, and they

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.400
[Guest]: would like write about this.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.280
[Guest]: So I would like finish my quota every night.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.920
[Guest]: And that's when I started like going home late at night and you know, meeting people

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:21.040
[Guest]: with different kinds of stuff to offer, you know, and that's when I would like be enlightened

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:26.080
[Guest]: a little bit like traveling home at night on YouTube, like going to the weirder side

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.460
[Guest]: of YouTube to find comedy and look at like a lot of improv work.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:35.280
[Guest]: So that's when I discovered Bill Hicks and George Carlin and, and Wanda Sykes and all

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.200
[Guest]: these stand up comedians I'd never heard of, but like I would love their material because

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.880
[Guest]: they were like so weird and edgy.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.800
[Guest]: And hence I decided to like go and do an open mic at some point in my life.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.200
[Amit Varma]: And that's where I ended up at like Hive and did my first open mic.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:53.160

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:15.520
[Amit Varma]: I'm with Naveen Narona of Keeping it Queer and the Good Child fame.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.560
[Amit Varma]: So Naveen, you were talking about, you know, you're coming out to your parents in phases

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:25.240
[Amit Varma]: and your first coming out has nothing to do with your sexual identity, but simply that

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.160
[Amit Varma]: you didn't want to follow the conventional route and be of an engineer and wanted to

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.840
[Unknown]: be a writer and stuff like that.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.640
[Amit Varma]: And how did that kind of proceed?

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.040
[Amit Varma]: How did they come to terms with it?

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.840
[Guest]: It was really difficult because there was more money in engineering, obviously.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:43.440
[Guest]: So I had to like make enough money on the side to make sure that I could like, you know,

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.440
[Guest]: make ends meet.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.680
[Guest]: And the first job did offer like a decent package.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.920
[Guest]: And from there, I also would like do DMC on the weekends, they said, so that would give

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.360
[Guest]: me some more money.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.440
[Guest]: So overall, I was like taking care of the house now slowly.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:02.160
[Guest]: And hence, like, there was still a certain level of attachment to the family.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.880
[Guest]: But they were constantly aware that I was not making as well and don't keep constantly,

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.120
[Guest]: you know, planting it in my head again and again that, hey, if you were doing this would

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.480
[Guest]: have been happier.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.480
[Guest]: Maybe you can go back to it.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.640
[Guest]: And I was like, no, I've left that life behind entirely.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.720
[Guest]: I was happy doing what I was doing.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:24.600
[Guest]: So it was like, for the longest time, I did not emote so much at home, which I also regret

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.320
[Guest]: now because I could have been more abrupt about it.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.280
[Guest]: And, you know, like, I just tried to like, placate everybody at the same time and make

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.480
[Guest]: sure I could hold all those things together.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:38.600
[Guest]: Because one of the main reasons coming out is difficult in India, because what if they

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.520
[Guest]: throw me out and I have to like, then be on the streets.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.720
[Guest]: So I just have to make sure that I can make sure I can earn enough money at the same time

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:51.080
[Guest]: and take care of myself if that whole phase happens when I have to go out.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:58.200
[Guest]: And then the second coming out happened around the same time because I was so away from the

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.880
[Guest]: church for a while that I did not want to go back to it and, you know, be in the same

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:07.480
[Guest]: environment with the same kind of homophobic because religion is kind of like very handy

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.360
[Guest]: when it comes to homophobia.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.760
[Guest]: People start quoting lines and stuff like that, which I don't want to deal with.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:18.160
[Guest]: So proactively, I stopped going to church and that was a very hateful period in my house

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.080
[Guest]: because they could not take that at all.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.440
[Guest]: Like, you know, I was raised in such a strong household that for me, not going to church

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.080
[Guest]: was like the biggest sin I'd ever committed in my entire life.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.360
[Amit Varma]: And looking back retrospectively, would you say you were ever a believer in God per se

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.800
[Amit Varma]: or you got so involved in the church because of the community and cultural aspects of it?

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.800
[Guest]: That's the latter.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.880
[Guest]: I think like we eventually end up saying that we believe in God and we love him and everything.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.520
[Guest]: But older I grew, obviously, there was a more sense of, oh, wait, like, what if there's

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.240
[Guest]: a supreme being that we don't know how to put a name to?

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.880
[Guest]: And then you will see all the killings that are happening in the name of religion and

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.080
[Guest]: you know, you read a little bit and you understand that, oh, all of this is kind of made up and

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.120
[Guest]: the crusades happened.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:02.160
[Guest]: So you know, like when you would think about all of these things, you'd be like, oh, wait,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.640
[Guest]: like let's take a backtracking mechanism here and be like, the main reason you liked it

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.040
[Guest]: so much because everybody's just like so into you and they all praise you and they all want

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.760
[Guest]: to make the best out of what they're given sort of.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.800
[Guest]: So like our church annual parties and, you know, family gatherings and all that were

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.600
[Guest]: like pretty famous because you'd pay 60 bucks and then get a raffle ticket for Easter and

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.080
[Guest]: at the same time eat free biryani and shit like that.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.560
[Guest]: So they keep you in the system like that, you know, don't call free biryani shit like

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.560
[Guest]: that.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.560
[Guest]: Oh, I've been on a keto diet all of this year, I'd do anything for a biryani.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.560
[Guest]: Oh, me too.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.960
[Amit Varma]: I'm going tonight to have somebody, I'm afraid I can't.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.960
[Guest]: Don't send me pictures.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.240
[Guest]: It'll be on Instagram tomorrow morning.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.320
[Amit Varma]: I don't follow you on Instagram anymore.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.720
[Guest]: So yeah, it was good to have that system.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:51.120
[Guest]: But you know, I yearned for more, as I said, like, it's just it's so much easier to understand

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.720
[Guest]: that sometimes all the hard work you do has a payoff, instead of people subverting you

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.760
[Guest]: and telling you you're doing a good job.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.640
[Guest]: So when I start deviating from the church, it was really difficult for my family to digest

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.160
[Guest]: the fact by default, like it was, it was like the biggest travesty and I was so now like

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.160
[Amit Varma]: nobody's business.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.720
[Amit Varma]: Is there a moment where you announced to them that there is a clean cut between you and

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.520
[Guest]: the church or an atheist now?

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.880
[Guest]: There was like my mom and my sister were at home and they were trying to like really argue

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.920
[Guest]: and debate about why I'm not believing in all of this.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.000
[Guest]: Like I would not even step out of my room when they would start praying and my family

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.840
[Guest]: is such for like 30 minutes before the midnight, before dinner every night, we spent 30 minutes

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.120
[Guest]: praying like, you know, kneeling down and raising our hands in the air kind of like

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.740
[Guest]: crazy stuff.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:40.480
[Guest]: So I would just like stop participating in that and my sister was like, tell me why?

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.840
[Guest]: And I'd be like, look at the whole way it's skewed and look at all this pedophilia and

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:49.040
[Guest]: look at all how the church is, you know, like taking money from people, not helping them,

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.040
[Guest]: all of that.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.560
[Guest]: Like, why is there so much disparity in African kids and Indian kids, we are so entitled,

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.800
[Guest]: all of that.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:59.680
[Guest]: And my mom was like, just like for, for like five days more, go to church and try it out.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.720
[Guest]: I'm like, for five days, mom, you try to be an atheist, you stop believing in God and

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.720
[Guest]: stop going to church.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.120
[Guest]: So like, how can you make me do something I don't want to do?

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.360
[Guest]: And I'm like, touche, right now, that's what exactly what's happening.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.400
[Guest]: And she was like, oh, wait, then she actually took a step back and she realized she was

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.480
[Guest]: doing the same thing to me, which I wanted her to do for a change.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.640
[Guest]: And then she was a little more calmer after that, she was like, okay, I think it's your

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.640
[Guest]: call.

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:25.200
[Guest]: But my dad, again, like my dad always goes to the extreme, does not exactly, he does

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.880
[Guest]: not talk to me, talk to me, but also does not, like, he pulls the strings from the background,

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.960
[Guest]: basically, he'll talk to my mom about something and he'll surnow her, and then her head is

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.600
[Guest]: hurting because of my dad constantly, you know, bickering with her.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.400
[Guest]: So I was feeling like I'm causing all this stress in my family, I might as well move

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.880
[Guest]: out now itself, because it's easier to like, just vanish from their lives.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:49.120
[Guest]: Again, a very stupid, impulsive teenage decision, I'm not even a teenager back then, I was 23.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:53.400
[Guest]: But I felt like going away from the house for some time would have been helpful.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.800
[Guest]: But that did not help at all, like they were crying more than they were usually doing that.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.600
[Guest]: And my dad would like, my dad picked up his phone and called me and I knew like shit's

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.240
[Guest]: going down because he hardly calls me.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.320
[Guest]: And he's like, you've just like, gone and haven't told us where you are and what's happening.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.920
[Guest]: So after like 15 days, I finally got back home.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.040
[Guest]: And that's when I sat my mom down and I told her first.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:19.040
[Guest]: And there was a plan in action where it was like her birthday approaching, so we would

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.140
[Guest]: not tell the entire family until her birthday.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:26.680
[Guest]: So we could like keep this between mother and son and then slowly tell the rest of the

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.560
[Guest]: family in a more civilized manner when they all gathered together.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.320
[Guest]: So I could also do my piece and be like, hey, let me decentralize you, instead of you all

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.680
[Guest]: just like assuming things.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:42.480
[Guest]: But my mom could not keep it inside and this is your third coming out of saying that, yeah.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:46.240
[Guest]: And this was the final official for me like being openly gay sort of thing.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.720
[Guest]: And I was like, the whole world knows, everybody knows, everybody's cool with it.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.040
[Amit Varma]: I just want you all to be okay with it.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.240
[Amit Varma]: And you've prepared them like first you're a writer, then you're an atheist and what

00:35:54.240 --> 00:36:00.280
[Guest]: can get worse and your dad is thinking it's okay, it can't get worse.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:04.400
[Guest]: And yeah, so like I was expecting my mom to not tell anybody and I remember it was a Monday.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.400
[Guest]: So we had Monday.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.660
[Amit Varma]: How did your mom react?

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.660
[Guest]: So she was very chill.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:12.440
[Guest]: Like she just like, looked into the distance and like, I've heard about people.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.720
[Guest]: And she told me about one of her family relatives who was gay and married a woman and then would

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.040
[Guest]: still go and have sex with men.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.800
[Guest]: And when his wife finally found out she lost her marbles, like she literally went insane.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.880
[Guest]: They had to put her in an asylum.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.160
[Guest]: And I was just like, do you want that future for me, mom?

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:31.240
[Guest]: Because if I marry a woman tomorrow, as per your wishes, I'll end up like not satisfying

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.200
[Guest]: her and she'll then like blame us and you know, all that racket.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.120
[Guest]: And a lot of people do live that lifestyle.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:42.120
[Guest]: And she was like, you know what, like, it's okay, I understand, I can live with the fact

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.600
[Guest]: that there are people who are gay out there.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.600
[Guest]: But it's just difficult because I think you're my son and how will you lead a life like that?

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.000
[Guest]: And that's why I was like, it's okay, because I've told a lot of people and they all chill

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.160
[Guest]: with it and they're all like supporting and really understanding.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.440
[Guest]: I just want you all to be in my corner.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.920
[Guest]: But I think I don't know how she took it that night.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.960
[Guest]: She mulled over it because when I told her it was cool, because I went to an open mic

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.680
[Guest]: directly after that moment, and I went and declared that open mic that for two years,

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.080
[Guest]: I've been trying to come out to my family and tonight it actually happened.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.520
[Guest]: I have footage of that.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.240
[Guest]: And people were applauding and it was pretty good.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.440
[Guest]: Kanan Gill was hosting that night.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.440
[Guest]: He was really happy.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.920
[Guest]: Like he went and joked about how dreams come true at open mics and stuff like that.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.200
[Guest]: And it was a really positive moment in my life for a change.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:28.200
[Guest]: But the very next day, I felt like there was some amount of disdain in my house.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.640
[Guest]: The air hung very like serious and my mom and dad and my sister were both like staring

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:37.640
[Guest]: at me with intense, like, you know, like, I actually went bald the same week I came

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.920
[Guest]: out, which is not the smartest move because now they had two reasons to hate me.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.920
[Amit Varma]: Because I had like...

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.920
[Amit Varma]: Well done.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.920
[Guest]: Tactically brilliant.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.840
[Guest]: At least my hair came back, I'm still gay that way.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.840
[Guest]: So so you know, they were like, not getting what I was trying to tell them.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.680
[Guest]: And then I called my friend who's also a gay activist.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:01.520
[Guest]: And he was like, if you want to come home and stay with us, you can sort the situation

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.280
[Guest]: out, don't worry.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.000
[Guest]: But I would say stay back, talk to them.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.680
[Guest]: So this was from a Monday to Friday, it was just constant, you know, like, should I leave?

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.680
[Guest]: Should I stay?

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.680
[Amit Varma]: Should I leave?

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.680
[Guest]: Should I stay?

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.680
[Guest]: And how did your dad react?

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:15.680
[Guest]: He was again stone cold.

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.680
[Amit Varma]: He just like he goes into his whole...

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.680
[Amit Varma]: He wouldn't talk to you.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:22.280
[Guest]: Like he goes into a gargoyle mode where he just like ignores my existence altogether.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.360
[Guest]: And like, again, all the talking happens to my mother, right?

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:30.160
[Guest]: And hence when, like when I came out, he was again like not understanding.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:36.280
[Guest]: So I used Aamir Khan's Satyamev Jayate episode on LGBT rights to show it to them that, hey,

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.840
[Guest]: there are more people like me, watch this video, Aamir Khan's cool about it.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.840
[Guest]: So why can't you be cool about it?

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.280
[Guest]: So that weekend, that Saturday or Sunday, I showed them the video, and then they softened

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.720
[Guest]: up a little bit.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:53.120
[Guest]: So a whole week of like, softened up as in, they're like, yeah, it's okay, dad, you're

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.120
[Guest]: okay.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.120
[Guest]: They finally said that line.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.360
[Guest]: Like, you know, we understand it's okay, but don't do something wrong, was the idea.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.960
[Guest]: Because my mom was like, okay, there's still people who are gay, just immediately they

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.960
[Guest]: have AIDS.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.960
[Unknown]: Like, that's how it works.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:04.960
[Guest]: I'm like, no.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.600
[Guest]: But then you have to, again, pick your battles every day, one at a time.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.920
[Guest]: And I decided to come out first and then talk about the other stuff in life.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.440
[Amit Varma]: In some sense, I mean, I mean, you spoke about this a lot.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.160
[Amit Varma]: And it was the whole narrative was very moving in the show that you did The Good Child.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:23.760
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that kind of struck me there was that, you know, up till this

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.800
[Amit Varma]: point, you could say your parents brought you up, but now suddenly you were bringing

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:32.800
[Amit Varma]: them up by revealing all these aspects of yourselves and forcing them to grow, to kind

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.280
[Amit Varma]: of accept you as you are.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.480
[Guest]: And a lot of growing up happens between these conversations.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:44.040
[Guest]: Because around the same time, my mom's main, you know, concern that year was that while

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:49.080
[Guest]: I came out to her, my sister, who also had an autistic kid was diagnosed autistic that

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.080
[Guest]: year.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:55.080
[Guest]: So it was like a double blow, she felt almost like, you know, and in a very weird way, like,

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.400
[Guest]: my sister's kids, autism kind of helped her cope with the fact that, hey, I did not have

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.800
[Guest]: a choice in how I chose my orientation, because the kid did not choose how he would have a

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.440
[Guest]: social anxiety in life.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:09.960
[Guest]: You know, like, so even though it's weird that it's a it's a mental illness, and orientation

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:15.080
[Guest]: is not the same, you know, not the same level, I still choose to be like, hey, at least it's

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.840
[Guest]: helping her understand and deal with it, you know, you can be very politically correct

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.640
[Guest]: at the same time with your parents, because there's always going to be some level of weirdness

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.640
[Guest]: to it.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.520
[Guest]: So I shave my face, she's like, you know what, I like you better with a beard, because that

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:31.000
[Guest]: looks more manly on you, you look more effeminate, I'm like, Mom, how can you say such amazing

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.040
[Guest]: things and weird things at the same time?

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.040
[Guest]: That's how mothers are.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.020
[Guest]: They are just like, they're concerned about you, but they'll take it in their stride eventually

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:41.380
[Guest]: by just like letting them love you for who you are again.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:46.680
[Guest]: So that's, that's my main point that if you don't stop pretending, you'll never know how

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.480
[Amit Varma]: your family is going to like you and you know,

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.400
[Amit Varma]: And does that normalcy extend to for example, like, have you ever taken any of the men you

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:58.560
[Amit Varma]: were dating home or any of your gay activist friends and you know, how does the family

00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.560
[Guest]: react to that?

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.880
[Guest]: Well, I've met some of my gay friends, but I've never brought anybody home.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.240
[Guest]: I think they're still a little far away.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.040
[Guest]: And like, they know that I'm doing comedy and I talk about this and I give interviews

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.080
[Guest]: and it's all over the newsletter.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:16.880
[Guest]: So they know for a fact that there's some level of publicity that goes with my work.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:21.880
[Guest]: And I think it's okay, because I tell them I'm doing it for the right reasons, you know.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:28.840
[Guest]: And eventually, my mom and I do talk about like, when I'm going out with like, you know,

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.960
[Guest]: what's it like to have lived inside the closet and outside the closet, and this whole conversation

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.520
[Guest]: goes on for a while.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:40.200
[Guest]: But I'm still not like seriously going to take her to meet a guy I'm dating and vice

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.200
[Amit Varma]: versa.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:45.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, for a gay person, as opposed to a straight person, the process of finding

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.840
[Amit Varma]: love is very difficult, finding love, finding companionship, and so on, you know, straight

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.840
[Amit Varma]: men do it through, you know, whatever the normal socializing you do, and you like someone

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.680
[Amit Varma]: and you hit on them.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:59.000
[Amit Varma]: And if it's Bollywood, then you EFTs them till they give in.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.380
[Amit Varma]: But for someone like you, it's a very fraught process, because you might keep bumping into

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.160
[Amit Varma]: homophobia in different places.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:11.200
[Amit Varma]: And you know, how did that kind of process work out where you start, where you start

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.720
[Amit Varma]: finding companionship and that kind of friendship?

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:19.320
[Guest]: So there's obviously online dating, which has helped a lot of people meet cool people

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.040
[Guest]: around the world.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:26.800
[Guest]: And that's what I found, like, my past relationships have been of three different apps.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:30.560
[Guest]: So that way, I've been like meeting enough number of people overall.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.320
[Guest]: In fact, I made like a list for my ex when I was dating him that these are the men I've

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.760
[Guest]: slept with in my past and beyond this, there won't be anybody else but you.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.760
[Unknown]: Wow.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.360
[Guest]: Very naive move because there was the list continues to this day.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:48.560
[Guest]: But you know, I tell every new lover, I do I do I'm very on the face sort of because

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.840
[Guest]: like it is like when you're going to the whole world of gay dating.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.920
[Guest]: It's very easy to get sex because it's just like it's that easy.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.760
[Guest]: It's like, you know, nobody knows no one keeps a track of it.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.640
[Guest]: The thrill of it is what actually excites a lot of people like it's all behind closed

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.840
[Guest]: doors and everything.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.360
[Guest]: So it's easy to get laid.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.600
[Guest]: But then when someone says translate this love outside where you can walk on the street

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.320
[Guest]: on the pavement with your partner's hand in your hand, or you know, go on dates and stuff

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.880
[Guest]: like that, it immediately becomes a problem because then you're acting like two bros on

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:19.280
[Guest]: a date who won't sit on the same side of the table, won't feed each other, you know, the

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.520
[Guest]: cutesy things you want to do because you have to, you have to act a certain way.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:28.560
[Guest]: So again, like, you know, this happened because as soon as you want to show your love, it

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.640
[Guest]: becomes too cumbersome for some people.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.880
[Guest]: And that's how most relationships don't work out in the long run.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:38.600
[Guest]: People online will tell you that he's looking for hookups and not for like longevity.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.320
[Guest]: And again, just like go from one guy to the other hoping that this one works out.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.560
[Guest]: So that was like for the longest time.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.400
[Guest]: And I was very gullible in my early 20s.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:52.120
[Guest]: I feel like because I was so bought up on the idea for Mills and Boones-esque love story

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.560
[Guest]: where the whole world is like, you know, behind you and you're like riding on the beach with

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.680
[Guest]: like a horse or whatever.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:04.880
[Amit Varma]: Not the guy, but riding on the beach with a horse and a guy.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:11.480
[Guest]: So I had a very, very rom-com-esque look at life and didn't work out really well because

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:15.120
[Guest]: nobody was willing to come out of the closet even like to meet me halfway.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:19.640
[Guest]: I think every woman is looking for a man like you who looks at the world like that.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.320
[Guest]: But yeah, eventually we all end up being jaded.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.320
[Guest]: So it's cool.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.880
[Guest]: Like, you know, like right now at 26, 27, I'm like...

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.960
[Amit Varma]: But are you jaded or when you meet the next man, will you again be a romantic?

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.040
[Guest]: I am dating a very young kid right now.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:35.920
[Guest]: I'm dating a 20-year-old who used to stalk me before I got to know who he was.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.840
[Guest]: Basically, he watched me live at a stand-up show and then was following up with my social

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.560
[Guest]: media work and then finally got the courage to say, hey, I like you and I met him and

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.160
[Guest]: it's kind of cute.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.200
[Guest]: So yeah.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.480
[Guest]: So it's like, you know, in a weird way, like I didn't have to resort to like online dating

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.960
[Guest]: to find this person because they were already there in my life before I realized it, you

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.960
[Guest]: know.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:02.440
[Guest]: And hence, it's cool to like go out and associate, go to parties and situations.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:07.160
[Guest]: But again, my brand with parties, again, is that they all just like come together and

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.320
[Guest]: couples have a good time.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:12.440
[Guest]: But people who are looking for love or for sex that night end up meeting each other and

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.880
[Guest]: hooking up for that one night.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.000
[Guest]: And I sometimes end up being worried about like, what's the health situation?

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.200
[Guest]: And you don't know because you meet someone randomly and that night you will have sex.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:28.600
[Guest]: And a lot of people do not tell you about what their STD situation is.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.600
[Guest]: And how do you know that?

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.720
[Guest]: So you have to like worry about that as well.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.880
[Guest]: So a lot of things go on in your mind when you're going out there, you know, it's not

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.880
[Guest]: it's not just like, you go and meet the man of your dreams overnight.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:43.560
[Guest]: It's a trial and error method and again, like get checked every two or three months.

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.820
[Amit Varma]: So I think in around 2007, when I was writing a column for Mint, I'd written this piece

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:52.720
[Amit Varma]: called the Matunga racket, a friend of mine, Vikram doctor had put me on to something that

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:57.560
[Amit Varma]: used to happen where cops would basically go online and they'd hook up with gay men

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:01.800
[Unknown]: pretending to be a gay man themselves and call them to Matunga station.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.640
[Amit Varma]: And when the person landed up in Matunga station, they'd grab him and take him to his ATM machine

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:11.960
[Amit Varma]: and take out whatever cash and basically blackmail the guy using 377 I mean, like all bad laws,

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.320
[Guest]: it was a rent seeking mechanism for them.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.720
[Guest]: Does that kind of thing still happen?

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.720
[Guest]: It still happens.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:20.880
[Guest]: My friend who went to Delhi last week got extorted by two dudes.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:25.220
[Guest]: Like even if it's not cops, it's other men only who are trying to run a racket on online.

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:29.960
[Guest]: And because section 377 is so highly spoken about, people use it all the time to extort

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.520
[Guest]: money out of people and you know, they'll rob you, they'll beat you up, they'll go come

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.000
[Guest]: to your hotel room.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.120
[Guest]: Because again, like the trust factor is so weird on these online dating apps.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.520
[Guest]: People don't show their face and you've seen me joke about that as well when I speak about

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:47.000
[Guest]: Grindr is that like people do not want to show that they're gay on Grindr.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.640
[Guest]: And if that person is on Grindr, it's because they're gay, unless they're trying to extort

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.560
[Guest]: you and they can't extort you for being gay in this country, unless they catch you in

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:58.880
[Guest]: the act of carnal intercourse, there's no way they can send you to jail for being gay.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, you should really just brazen it out.

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.760
[Amit Varma]: But I think the main fear of most of the people who get caught is that their family will be

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.400
[Amit Varma]: told they might not have come out.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.400
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.800
[Guest]: But then again, that's the system it's feeding itself, you know, we don't come out because

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.120
[Guest]: we're scared about like what the society will say, society will say something because we're

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.120
[Guest]: not coming out.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.120
[Guest]: It's a vicious cycle of...

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:20.760
[Amit Varma]: If you just come out and you can do it fearlessly, then that's...

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.760
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.760
[Guest]: Then they won't say, oh, you're gay, I'll tell your family.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.760
[Guest]: Sure, go ahead.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.800
[Guest]: I told my family before you, I beat you to it.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:26.800
[Guest]: Give me money now.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.120
[Guest]: That's how you extort the money out of them.

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:33.760
[Guest]: I don't know, because I've found so much comfort in telling people that I can't imagine living

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.400
[Guest]: that kind of suffocated life.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:40.280
[Guest]: We're trying to like meet all your life's goals at the same time, worry about this constantly

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:44.040
[Guest]: that you can't tell your family or they'll find out someday and then how will they react.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:48.920
[Guest]: Dealing with that guilt is so difficult sometimes that just saying it out loud helps you.

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:52.360
[Guest]: This went out so much of the of the aggression that you've lived with your entire life, you

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.280
[Guest]: know, like with my mom at every stage in my life from the point I was 15 when I could

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.580
[Guest]: like, you know, reaffirm my thoughts.

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:01.960
[Guest]: That thing was always there on my albums, I'd be like right here, I would hold on to

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:02.960
[Guest]: it and not tell her.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:07.800
[Guest]: And I just regret I had wish I told her earlier so everything that happened in my life afterwards

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.960
[Guest]: would have been much more easier to deal with, you know, I could have gone into the arts

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.320
[Guest]: much easily instead of having to struggle and try to please them at every level.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:18.500
[Guest]: That's what we're told as Indian kids, right, just please your parents at every level.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:22.080
[Guest]: But if you just come out and be who you are, and just tell them like for the for the from

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:26.560
[Guest]: the very beginning that you do not care about the world's opinion, because you can do what

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.660
[Guest]: you want to do in your life eventually.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:32.200
[Guest]: And who you want to do in your life eventually, you'll find that kind of happiness.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.700
[Guest]: And I think it's for everybody in this community to take that control of that life.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.920
[Guest]: Because as soon as you let these powers extort you for something that's not wrong, then

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.600
[Guest]: you yourself becoming a part of the problem, right?

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.680
[Amit Varma]: Because you're allowing them to, you're allowing yourself to be a victim, basically, which

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.680
[Guest]: you don't have to.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.680
[Amit Varma]: You don't have to.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.680
[Amit Varma]: So I'm just thinking aloud here.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:54.480
[Amit Varma]: It strikes me that, you know, for for most of us, and certainly for me, sexuality is

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.840
[Amit Varma]: something that is incidental.

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.360
[Amit Varma]: I happen to be heterosexual.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.360
[Amit Varma]: And that's it.

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.600
[Amit Varma]: But it doesn't shape me in any other way than that.

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:06.000
[Amit Varma]: But would it be the case that for for you and for maybe for other gay people, you know,

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.920
[Amit Varma]: that your sexuality does shape you in much deeper ways, because that whole struggle of

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:14.680
[Amit Varma]: coming to terms with what you are and bringing it out to the world consumes you and makes

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.360
[Amit Varma]: you who you are?

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:20.720
[Guest]: It does, like almost every other gay friend I have, like has some level of social anxiety,

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:25.640
[Guest]: they live with like depression and they self doubt a lot.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:31.320
[Guest]: You know, it's a very in depth problem because of like living with so much denial and you

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:35.360
[Guest]: know, not being able to come out can do like a lot of things wrong for you.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.680
[Guest]: Internally, because you just like end up crying every night.

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:42.560
[Guest]: And I'm not even generalizing here, because I know a lot of friends who are going through

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.880
[Guest]: the same thing over and over again.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.200
[Guest]: Exactly why there's so many suicide cases and so many, like, you know, all these high

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:52.480
[Guest]: fun situations happen because people push themselves and try to get the best out of

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:58.160
[Guest]: life when they can't really put a label to it, you know, and that kind of lifestyle kind

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.760
[Guest]: of ends up very tragically sometimes.

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.800
[Guest]: And at 17, I was very suicidal, I wanted to just like end my life and be done with it,

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.840
[Guest]: it seemed like an easy option.

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:12.000
[Guest]: So I think we have to talk about mental illness also very profoundly when it comes to gay

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.320
[Guest]: rights, because there's like a lot of extremism there as well, and we're not really controlling

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.560
[Guest]: it properly, you know.

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:26.080
[Guest]: And that's why I think a problem that is associated with coming out or with growing up gay is

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.320
[Guest]: that you suppress so much to an extent that you use every kind of method to like deal

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.920
[Guest]: with that.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:36.920
[Guest]: And I've seen like, a lot of people in the community slowly, you know, giving up and

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:42.520
[Guest]: passing away in their own stride, you know, like how they ended their lives because they

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.960
[Amit Varma]: could not deal with the worries of how the world is.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.880
[Amit Varma]: And the tragic part is that it's the fault of society or the state and whoever's fault

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:52.320
[Amit Varma]: it is, it's not their fault, they're victims.

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:56.760
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, every suicide is a murder in a manner of speaking.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:02.120
[Amit Varma]: Let's then you know, move on from here to talk about the LGBT community and I'm sort

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:06.360
[Amit Varma]: of if I can show quote marks around the word community, because I often don't understand

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.360
[Amit Varma]: such terms.

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:11.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the way I look at the world is we're all sort of just individuals.

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:16.800
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, we form communities around our interests or our identities or whatever, but they don't.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.320
[Amit Varma]: What is this queer community?

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.680
[Guest]: So queer community is mainly a stronghold for a lot of people, because, as I said, like

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:26.960
[Guest]: a lot of parents do not accept their kids as they are, so they find their own families.

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.840
[Guest]: And hence the need for a queer community to be born.

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:35.520
[Guest]: Because if it dates back to the American Stonewall period, right, where a lot of people would

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.400
[Guest]: come together and party.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.680
[Guest]: And even though they had varied interests, for example, some had drag queens coming in,

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:46.640
[Guest]: some had like lesbian butch women coming in, some had gay men coming into like hookup.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.400
[Guest]: The normalcy was found that they were all the same kind of heathens, right?

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:54.600
[Guest]: And hence they would come together and party and they would like try to, again, back in

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:59.480
[Guest]: the day, extort money, cops would charge in on them, the Stonewall riots happened.

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:03.720
[Guest]: And like any riot that happens because of a community is because of the understanding

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.520
[Guest]: that they've all suffered from the same problems.

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:13.080
[Guest]: And if you were like a black lesbian, back in the 50s, you were already down the drain

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:17.160
[Guest]: because you were like, the lowest rung when it comes to understanding, if you're a white

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.200
[Guest]: gay man, you still have some privilege.

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.480
[Guest]: But if you're a black lesbian woman, you have a different kind of privilege, which is not

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.680
[Guest]: afforded to you.

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.800
[Guest]: So for them, fighting the supreme power became like a common thing.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:33.640
[Guest]: And hence, the LGBT community around the world is fighting the same thing, finding the commonness

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:38.960
[Guest]: in being who you are at the same time, also finding love and acceptance within the community.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:44.320
[Amit Varma]: And now it's where it is like, you know, it's a community, therefore, which is born not

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:50.800
[Amit Varma]: out of the identity you're born into, but it's a community of choice and necessity.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.960
[Guest]: And is it therefore stronger for that reason?

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:57.040
[Guest]: It is because the commonness in the voice and the power with which the community hits

00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.560
[Guest]: back, because it does have the most creative individuals overall.

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:04.320
[Guest]: And you know, if you look at the ad campaigns that have gone around the world in the past

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:09.160
[Guest]: few years, with regards to finding gay voices and giving them rights, you'll find a very

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:13.080
[Guest]: innovative way of storytelling because it's not just about fighting for rights, but also

00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:16.560
[Guest]: about the right to love, right to like, you know, find the same kind of housing that everybody

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.720
[Guest]: else has.

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:21.320
[Guest]: So when you look at it from an emotional level, gay marriage is making more sense, because

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:26.400
[Guest]: then if you can't live with the person you love the most, then how would you even live?

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:31.560
[Guest]: And hence, the whole community became more stronger in the mid 2009 when Obama was like,

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:36.480
[Guest]: you know, and believe it or not, like everywhere around the world, America does influence the

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.400
[Guest]: thought pattern a lot when it comes to all the liberalist movements.

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:44.960
[Guest]: And so then when moved on to Europe as well, it became much easier for them to mimic these

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.400
[Guest]: movements and you know, allow people to vote for the right thing.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.920
[Guest]: And if you look at like the ad campaign Ireland did to like get Paris to come out and vote

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:55.320
[Guest]: for their kids favour, because like, it's a matter of love.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:59.400
[Guest]: And when you boil it down to love, it's all kind of coming together already.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:06.080
[Guest]: So that's why the LGBT community has been ever inclusive, because now it's gone to QIA.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:11.200
[Guest]: And you know, intersex, asexual, queer couples are also like a part of the whole gamut now.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:14.960
[Guest]: And we are just getting to the tip of the iceberg now is what I mean.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:20.520
[Guest]: And in India, how strong is it's pretty strong now, like in Bombay, and mainly metro cities

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:25.160
[Guest]: like Delhi, Bangalore and Kolkata and Chennai.

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.960
[Guest]: So they have like a lot of collectives coming together, a lot of people do a lot of different

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:29.960
[Guest]: things.

00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:35.400
[Guest]: So people organize parties, some people do actual donation work, some people do research

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.640
[Guest]: work.

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:41.000
[Guest]: And you have like eight centres to help people diagnose themselves.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.080
[Guest]: And research centres again for that very purpose.

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:47.480
[Guest]: So a lot of things happening in Bombay, when you do the pride, like every year, the number

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:50.800
[Guest]: of people participating increases along with the allies.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:54.280
[Guest]: So from last year, it was 10,000, it went to 15,000 this year.

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.760
[Amit Varma]: And it's growing every year.

00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:01.360
[Amit Varma]: I was struck by what you said earlier about how your first few relationships came by because

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:02.360
[Amit Varma]: of online dating.

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:06.880
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, the need for online dating, therefore seems to indicate that the natural

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:11.880
[Amit Varma]: ecosystem within the real world where you meet other gay people simply wasn't that large.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:15.280
[Amit Varma]: So you had to do online dating, that's the only way you could meet new people.

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.560
[Amit Varma]: Is that something that's changed?

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.440
[Amit Varma]: Is the ecosystem larger?

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:23.040
[Amit Varma]: And very specifically, if say a young 17 year old or 18 year old gay person is listening

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.640
[Amit Varma]: to this podcast right now, and he's like, I want to go out there and meet more people

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:27.640
[Amit Varma]: like me.

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:30.280
[Amit Varma]: What's he got to do?

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:36.720
[Guest]: So you have to like look up the local, they have to basically look out for the local queer

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.480
[Guest]: center that they can approach.

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:43.400
[Guest]: If you're in Bombay, you have the Hamsafar Trust, which is in Wakola, they do a lot of

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:47.720
[Guest]: community based fun open mics, and they do like a lot of Friday evening get togethers,

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:51.280
[Guest]: while at the same time helping people get diagnosed and stuff like that, you know, so

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:56.120
[Guest]: like, you'll always have a lot of these queer centers and collectives and open mics and

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:57.720
[Guest]: activities to participate in.

00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:01.040
[Guest]: Don't go with the intention of hooking up to all of these, obviously, my whole thing

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:04.840
[Guest]: is that first go and learn the community, understand, meet people, understand different

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:08.440
[Guest]: behaviors, lifestyles, and you know, explore that side of it.

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:13.040
[Guest]: And then if you meet someone organically amazing, there are parties that associate with just

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.840
[Guest]: like getting you to drink and have a good time.

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.960
[Guest]: And a lot of things happen at these parties.

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:20.920
[Guest]: If that's your thing, then be about 21 and then have a good time.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:24.920
[Guest]: Don't be 17 and go to these parties, because then your image of the community will be different

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:27.360
[Guest]: than what you have to perceive.

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:31.880
[Guest]: And go to a pride, go to a local bookstore, you'd say in a sense that you'd go to these

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.480
[Amit Varma]: for the same reason that as a kid, you went to church to find that sense of community

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.560
[Guest]: rather than, yes, you know, any specific.

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.560
[Guest]: So in that way, nothing's changed.

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:44.840
[Guest]: So you're still the altar boy, I'm still the altar boy, but this time on the other end

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:47.040
[Amit Varma]: of the spectrum.

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.440
[Amit Varma]: And how has popular culture changed through this time?

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:55.840
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, when you were a kid in the late 90s, early 2000s, like from whatever,

00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:01.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, and one thing that is pretty obvious about Bollywood is that it's a tokenism.

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:05.200
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes they'll put a token gay out there, or sometimes they'll have a gay for comic

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:10.880
[Amit Varma]: effect and, you know, just, you know, perpetuate all those harmful stereotypes.

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:16.960
[Amit Varma]: And it's very rare that they actually like some of the most beautiful movies I've seen

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:22.880
[Amit Varma]: coming out of Hollywood in recent years, right from Brokeback Mountain to Moonlight, you

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:29.400
[Amit Varma]: know, do show gay love in such a beautiful way, but they have, I mean, apart from maybe

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:35.360
[Amit Varma]: I can offhand remember Kapoor and Sons, but how has popular culture adapted to this?

00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:39.440
[Guest]: Bollywood is still grasping, you know, at its kind of roots, because remember Dostana?

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:44.000
[Guest]: Like, I remember Dostana happened at a very formative year in my life when I was like,

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.520
[Unknown]: still in the church trying to, you know, come out to my church friends.

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:51.440
[Guest]: But then we went to watch this movie at Gayety Galaxy together.

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.480
[Guest]: And I was just like, very taken aback because I'm like, they're not even gay, they're just

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.600
[Amit Varma]: like pretending to be gay.

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:57.760
[Amit Varma]: I'm just happy you didn't make a pun about Gayety Galaxy.

00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.760
[Guest]: Continue.

00:57:58.760 --> 00:57:59.760
[Guest]: Oh yeah.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.760
[Guest]: You missed that.

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.640
[Guest]: I'll let that go this time.

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:07.800
[Guest]: But there is a magazine called Gayalaxy, by the way, it's a publication for the gays.

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:12.920
[Guest]: So they were all like enjoying the movie and I was like, this sounds so wrong as a movie.

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:17.080
[Guest]: It's just like pandering and it's not actually talking about gay rights, it's just like two

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:20.440
[Guest]: men acting gay to get a girl, that kind of stuff.

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:22.680
[Guest]: So I would just like, let it go.

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:28.260
[Guest]: And that's why when I was exposed to Western media, it was easier.

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:32.160
[Guest]: So if you watch Will and Grace or if you watch Modern Family, if you watch Queer as Folk,

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:35.920
[Guest]: then you get an idea of how it's a part of their culture, you know.

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:40.940
[Guest]: And since I was born in the 90s, right, so when I got to 2000s, the situation was much

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:43.560
[Guest]: better for the queers around India.

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:47.480
[Guest]: Like there were parties and there were associative events happening in scarcity.

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:51.840
[Guest]: But now, because it's been like spoken about so much and like everybody wants to get on

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:56.280
[Guest]: board this whole ship and be an ally and get on the bandwagon of, you know, being cool

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.360
[Guest]: because you're pro-gay, it's very common now.

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:03.440
[Guest]: So it's not such a rarity as it was when I was like 17 or 18.

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:08.520
[Guest]: Now I can go to a queer event every evening, every evening or every weekend almost now.

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.960
[Guest]: So it's a pretty chill situation.

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:11.960
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:16.680
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, you've been doing this very interesting show Keeping It Queer for quite

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:17.680
[Amit Varma]: a long time.

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.640
[Amit Varma]: I think your season two just got over.

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:22.840
[Amit Varma]: And what you do in the show for my listeners, and I recommend to my listeners that they

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.960
[Amit Varma]: check it out at IVMpodcast.com.

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.000
[Amit Varma]: Just look on the shows, look for Keeping It Queer.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.800
[Amit Varma]: It's a fantastic show.

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:33.600
[Amit Varma]: While doing the show, what are the sort of insights that you gained about what in a sense

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.080
[Guest]: was your community itself?

00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:42.160
[Guest]: I think that there's still a lot of sexism in the queer community itself, like it still

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:46.440
[Guest]: becomes a man show at the end, so the gay men think that they're entitled in some way.

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:51.640
[Guest]: And so there's still a lot of like toxic masculinity and, you know, a lot of these behaviour within

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:52.640
[Amit Varma]: the gay community.

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:58.160
[Guest]: And like they look down upon lesbians and trans women who mainly are the foremost leaders

00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.920
[Guest]: in the community.

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:04.600
[Guest]: And I've really ended up, because when I was growing up also, like, you know, the sight

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:08.840
[Guest]: of a trans person begging for money at the signal or in the train would scare me because

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.840
[Guest]: I was brought up in that kind of mentality.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:17.560
[Guest]: But the most humane touch that I've had, you know, the most humane interactions I've had

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.600
[Guest]: after being a part of the community is with trans people and understanding their stories

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.360
[Guest]: has been like the most poignant moment in my life.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:27.680
[Guest]: Like I've spoken to so many people, not only on record on Keeping It Queer, but like in

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.640
[Guest]: real life otherwise as well.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.760
[Guest]: Just the fact that they have gone through so much more than I could have ever gone makes

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:37.480
[Guest]: me understand the need for the struggle, the need for talking about it on a bigger platform

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.840
[Guest]: and getting to normalise this conversation because they have just been mistreated everywhere,

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:48.240
[Guest]: you know, like with jobs, with medical, healthcare, with their own families that thrown out, defined

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.320
[Guest]: their own communities.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:54.400
[Guest]: And despite people being aware that, you know, India comes from a very strong culturally

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.200
[Guest]: heritage wise, we are very strong in terms of respecting our trans people.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:04.120
[Guest]: They were put in the uppermost rungs of like the King's Sabha.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.200
[Guest]: So like what happened and how did we go wrong?

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:11.120
[Guest]: And the understanding of that helped me empathise a lot more with the trans community of this

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.120
[Amit Varma]: country.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:16.680
[Amit Varma]: And you were, of course, extremely fortunate, not just sort of in your background relatively,

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:20.920
[Amit Varma]: but also that you had comedy in your art as an outlet to which you could turn writing

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.920
[Guest]: as an outlet.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.400
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of people don't have that and things are tough for them.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.520
[Amit Varma]: And through the course of doing this show, you speak spoken to so many different kinds

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.520
[Amit Varma]: of people.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:36.680
[Amit Varma]: At what level, for you, when you think about the struggle that your life involves, does

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.480
[Amit Varma]: it involve not just a personal struggle of coming to terms with who you are and doing

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.600
[Amit Varma]: what you have to do and the personal struggles of your art, but also this larger struggle

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:51.960
[Amit Varma]: where, you know, you want to make India more progressive in this sense and sort of advance

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.840
[Guest]: the cause of the queer community as it were.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.840
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.720
[Guest]: And also like to tell them that, hey, listen to these love stories of these people, you

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.360
[Guest]: know, people, when they come to my show, I don't tell them like, oh, we're going to be

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.360
[Guest]: preachy about this.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.840
[Guest]: Just tell me what happened in your life.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.320
[Guest]: So they'll be like, oh, I had a crush on this person.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.200
[Guest]: I was a girl and I had a crush on a girl.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.440
[Guest]: And then she fell in love with me.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:11.960
[Guest]: And then we had the longest dating time, you know, and that makes me so happy because they're

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:17.280
[Guest]: not pretending to be anybody else than who they are and telling me a story that would

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.720
[Guest]: happen in anybody else's life.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:23.000
[Guest]: So the idea was always to create conversations which are still normalizing the whole idea

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.520
[Guest]: that we also have lives.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:29.320
[Guest]: It's just that we don't flash it too much because we're afraid that you won't like it.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.520
[Guest]: But maybe in this way, when you listen to our stories, you'll like it, you'll understand

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:38.280
[Guest]: that we do come with a certain sense of fear because of how we are treated in society.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.280
[Guest]: So that's why we need all these stories to come out and say that there's a promise for

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.320
[Guest]: a better tomorrow, even though it's going to be very rigorous and slow, we still have

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.480
[Guest]: hope that it'll get just better.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:51.720
[Guest]: And that's what like last year's Pride was, it gets better, was the theme of the Pride.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.720
[Amit Varma]: That's a lovely line.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.720
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.200
[Guest]: So it was so amazing because I went to the Pride with my microphone and spoke to so many

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.200
[Unknown]: people.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.080
[Guest]: So I did a queer edition for the Pride that year.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:08.600
[Guest]: And hence all these stories when I was setting out to put them together, it was like a audio

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.320
[Amit Varma]: journal, so to say, of these stories.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.320
[Amit Varma]: And where is it?

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.320
[Guest]: Where can people listen to this?

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.320
[Guest]: It's on ivampodcast.com only.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:19.160
[Guest]: So it's like, so that's the whole idea that I want to have all these people who are out

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.160
[Guest]: to talk about it.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:24.520
[Guest]: So when a kid looks up for it, when they're discovering queer identities and everything,

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:28.440
[Guest]: they'll have some kind of research work to go back to, which is again, like a very Indian

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:32.600
[Guest]: voice, you know, because as I said, I went to men from around the world to understand

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.040
[Guest]: what they went through.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.800
[Guest]: But the situation is very differently perceived in India.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.800
[Guest]: So I wanted to give listeners a chance to understand the queer Indian identity from

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.800
[Guest]: the podcast perspective.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:48.880
[Amit Varma]: Is there any of this happening in the languages itself or it's just sort of English?

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.520
[Guest]: I do speak to people in Marathi and Hindi as well on the show.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:56.680
[Guest]: But like, again, my language skills are mostly stronger in English.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.960
[Guest]: So we stuck to that.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:02.440
[Guest]: But there's also like, a lot of insight into what's it like to come from different backgrounds

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.920
[Guest]: and have different identities also, from around the country that to like, you know, I've spoken

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:15.040
[Guest]: to people on Skype and we had Alok Vaid Menon, they are a spoken word poet from America,

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:21.800
[Guest]: femme and very proudly so, so, so they actually face a lot of homophobia in America when they

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.020
[Guest]: walk on the streets.

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:26.480
[Guest]: So it was important to get their story when they came down to India, I kind of found them

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.960
[Guest]: and Shakti and Alok came and they did a great episode with me.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:35.640
[Guest]: So hence, I feel like, when you go back to understanding why you wanted to do this, there

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.000
[Guest]: has to be a purpose to this, right?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.940
[Guest]: So when we finally got all these stories, and I'd look back at it, and people find me

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:43.840
[Guest]: online and message me saying that, hey, I heard your podcast, it helped me cope with

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.840
[Guest]: so much.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:49.160
[Guest]: It means a lot to me eventually that I did not go on a on a save your mission at all.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.960
[Guest]: I was just like, I hope that someone did this for me.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.960
[Amit Varma]: And that's what I'm going to do for them.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.960
[Guest]: Had you heard something like this, when you were 15 or 16?

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.840
[Guest]: I would have been so much calmer and I would have been okay coming out sooner, but it didn't

01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.840
[Amit Varma]: happen.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.840
[Amit Varma]: So that's amazing.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:05.720
[Amit Varma]: Let me sort of I've taken a lot of your time, let me end with a dual question that is almost

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.120
[Amit Varma]: a cliche now, but I ask all guests of my show on whatever subject they're talking about,

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.280
[Amit Varma]: is that what makes you despair?

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:16.680
[Amit Varma]: And what makes you hopeful about the future of gay rights in India?

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:21.280
[Guest]: So the ignorance that we still have in the country with regards to gay rights, when I

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.720
[Guest]: talk to people about Section 377, they don't have any idea what that law is.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:29.560
[Guest]: Some people don't know a gay friend also, they don't have any kind of common sense.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.560
[Amit Varma]: Or if they do, they don't know that they know a gay friend.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.560
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.560
[Amit Varma]: And that's doubly tragic.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.560
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.880
[Guest]: So that is a lot of despair there, because I hope that everybody gets to feel the way

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:42.800
[Guest]: I get to feel, you know, and I'm entitled and I'm happy that way.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:47.960
[Guest]: But not many people can afford to like come out so easily, which is making me sadder.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.520
[Guest]: And what makes me hopeful is that there's a very strong ally movement in this country,

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:57.840
[Guest]: people, women, especially, who have felt the same kind of, you know, the society's rebuked

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.600
[Guest]: them on a certain level.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.600
[Guest]: So they understand.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:05.440
[Guest]: So I've made such great friendship with women who are so admirable in their own way, and

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.480
[Guest]: they go out of their way to help me out, deal with my own mental anxiety.

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.240
[Amit Varma]: And because they're also victims, and they're fighting society in their own way.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:16.120
[Guest]: So I found the strongest women in this country have been my strongest allies in some way

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.160
[Guest]: or the other.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:22.000
[Guest]: And even men who go on the femme side, I find them so adorable in their own way, you know,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.960
[Guest]: like people, whenever they tell you like, that whole Biola tag is gone from my head

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.960
[Guest]: entirely now.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.320
[Guest]: Now I look at men who are flamboyant, and I lose my shit and I become one of them, you

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.880
[Guest]: know, like, because I've always been an expressive kid, but I would hide that to become a part

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.040
[Guest]: of society.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:40.240
[Guest]: But when I'm dancing with them, or whenever I'm being a very stereotypical gay character,

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.960
[Guest]: but I'd be like, okay, girl, don't talk like that, you know, swinging our fingers and everything

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:44.960
[Guest]: snapping around.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:50.760
[Guest]: I feel happy, like, there's hope that I can talk like that one day and be okay in society.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760
[Amit Varma]: That's beautiful.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760
[Amit Varma]: I learned a lot talking to you.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:57.840
[Amit Varma]: And I think we just touched the surface of, you know, what we could talk about, but it's

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.960
[Amit Varma]: already been more than an hour.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.960
