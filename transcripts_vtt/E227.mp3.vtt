00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640
[Amit Varma]: We sometimes think of the economy as something removed from the real world.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.480
[Amit Varma]: There's numbers and graphs and tables and data, all things for policy wonks to look

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.600
[Amit Varma]: at or rich people with advisors.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.160
[Amit Varma]: But what does it have to do with our daily life?

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.840
[Amit Varma]: Well, everything.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.040
[Amit Varma]: One of the common themes on my show is that economics has human consequences.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.460
[Amit Varma]: Bad economic policy in a country like India can affect the lives of millions of people.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.600
[Amit Varma]: One reason I often say that some of Indira Gandhi's economic policies or Narendra Modi's

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.660
[Amit Varma]: demonetization were crimes on humanity.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.440
[Amit Varma]: They hurt the poor the most.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.720
[Amit Varma]: The thing is, bad policy is often couched in good intentions, and the bad outcomes they

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.440
[Amit Varma]: result in are often delayed, and the causation is often not obvious.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.520
[Amit Varma]: We need to talk more about economics so that people don't get fooled by lofty narrative

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.440
[Amit Varma]: and can figure out when they are being had.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.680
[Amit Varma]: That's one reason I started The Seen and The Unseen.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.880
[Amit Varma]: The title of the show is inspired by Frederick Barcia's famous essay, That Which is Seen

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.200
[Amit Varma]: and That Which is Not Seen.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.680
[Amit Varma]: I thought I'd examine the seen intentions and unseen outcomes of public policy.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.400
[Amit Varma]: Of course, the show has evolved to be much, much more than that.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.520
[Amit Varma]: I now do deep dive conversations, studying to examine not just economics, but also politics,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.840
[Amit Varma]: society and even the human condition.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.320
[Amit Varma]: That said, economics is at the end of the day, the study of human behavior under conditions

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.320
[Amit Varma]: of scarcity.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.920
[Amit Varma]: And so here I am, doing something I do every few months, taking stock of the Indian economy.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.160
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.160
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badman.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.640
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.140
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is a formidable economist, Ela Patnaik.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.720
[Amit Varma]: If there's one economic commentator whose body of work reveals a journey of the Indian

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.200
[Amit Varma]: economy in the last 30 years, it's Ela.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.980
[Amit Varma]: A child of Marxist parents, Ela studied at JNU in the 1980s, but was encouraged by her

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.640
[Amit Varma]: parents to think through the world for herself.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.560
[Amit Varma]: She went to do a PhD in England in the early 90s.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.800
[Amit Varma]: And just as India changed with liberalization, Ela swept aside the received dogmas of her

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.700
[Amit Varma]: Indian education and discovered the wonders of an open economy.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.560
[Amit Varma]: She talks a fair bit about this fascinating journey in our conversation today, and also

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.560
[Amit Varma]: of how for so many years she swam against the tide, both in economic policymaking and

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560
[Amit Varma]: in the public discourse.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.520
[Amit Varma]: Ela is a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, NIPFP, and has

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.560
[Amit Varma]: worked at many senior levels in Indian policymaking, including as a principal economic advisor

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.160
[Amit Varma]: to the government of India.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.080
[Amit Varma]: A mutual friend described her as an economist who brought macroeconomic thinking to India,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.380
[Amit Varma]: and she was one of the driving forces behind the RBI's inflation targeting.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.360
[Amit Varma]: If that sounds boring, it isn't.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.640
[Amit Varma]: Ela's also enlightened millions of people with her columns and her work on television,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.180
[Amit Varma]: and is now a bonafide econ superstar on YouTube.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.160
[Amit Varma]: She does a bunch of shows for the print, including one called Ela-nomics, I'll link it from the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.160
[Amit Varma]: show notes.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.640
[Amit Varma]: We not only discuss the road that she has traveled here, but also India's hesitant journey,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.920
[Amit Varma]: especially when it comes to economic reforms, where most of our governments since 1991 have

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.720
[Amit Varma]: failed us, including this one.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.960
[Amit Varma]: There isn't a simple narrative that explains this, and what has gone wrong is not the fault

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.720
[Amit Varma]: of one party alone.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.960
[Amit Varma]: The Indian economy has been going down, down, down for over a decade now, when Pranab Mukherjee

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.040
[Amit Varma]: took over at the Finance Ministry and set us on the road to ruin, a road that Narendra

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.200
[Amit Varma]: Modi's government seemed to gleefully embrace.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.960
[Amit Varma]: But if the decade leading up to 2020 was bad, the year since then has been worse because

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.960
[Amit Varma]: of COVID.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.920
[Amit Varma]: Ela and I take it step by step, discussing our broad journey after 1991, zooming into

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.200
[Amit Varma]: the last 10 years, and then zooming in further to the impact of COVID and looking ahead.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.120
[Amit Varma]: Like so many of my episodes, by the way, this feels like the latest installment in an ongoing

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.000
[Amit Varma]: conversation on the seen and the unseen.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.040
[Amit Varma]: I've linked earlier episodes on the economy in the show notes, as also important episodes

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.560
[Amit Varma]: with Pooja Mehra, Ajay Shah and Karthik Muralitharan.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.080
[Amit Varma]: Do you remember the argument Karthik and I had in our healthcare episode, episode 225

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.040
[Amit Varma]: about the high taxes on petrol?

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.960
[Amit Varma]: I feel they're horrendous, Karthik disagrees, and I got a chance to ask Ela for her views

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.960
[Amit Varma]: on that.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.560
[Amit Varma]: Guess whose side she came down on, bloat, bloat.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.400
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, time now for the conversation.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.120
[Amit Varma]: But before we begin, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.360
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.740
[Amit Varma]: Well, I'd love to help you.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.800
[Amit Varma]: Over the last year, I've enjoyed teaching my online course, The Art of Clear Writing,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.520
[Amit Varma]: and an online community has now sprung up of all my past students.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.880
[Amit Varma]: We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.480
[Amit Varma]: interaction that offers much stimulation and even some comfort in these difficult times.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.200
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.360
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.960
[Amit Varma]: There are many exercises, much interaction, and a lovely and lively community at the end

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.960
[Amit Varma]: of it.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.800
[Amit Varma]: The course costs Rs 10,000 plus GST, or about $150, and the June classes begin on June 5th.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.720
[Amit Varma]: So if you're interested, head on over to register at indiauncut.com slash clear writing.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.520
[Amit Varma]: That's indiauncut.com slash clear writing.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.200
[Amit Varma]: Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.560
[Amit Varma]: and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.560
[Amit Varma]: I can help you.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.880
[Amit Varma]: Hello, welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.880
[Guest]: Hi, Amit.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.880
[Guest]: How are you?

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.880
[Amit Varma]: I'm good.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.920
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, that very question, how are you, you know, takes on kind of so much significance

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.400
[Amit Varma]: in these times, because every day there is sort of some harrowing news from somewhere

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.400
[Amit Varma]: or the other.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400
[Amit Varma]: How are you?

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.160
[Amit Varma]: How have the last few months been for you?

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.200
[Guest]: Hunkered down, staying at home or work from home.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.960
[Guest]: We've just been fortunate that nobody very, very close has been ill or we've not lost

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.480
[Guest]: somebody as in the immediate family, though, you know, these are difficult times.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.800
[Guest]: Every day we lose friends and family members in the extended family.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.760
[Amit Varma]: But now for the last few days, it's been a little bit better.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.760
[Amit Varma]: Wonderful.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.640
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about your early life.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.680
[Amit Varma]: Like I'm guessing you're a 70s and 80s kid.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, you're just a little older than me.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.400
[Amit Varma]: You went to college in the 1980s, Hindu College, then JNU, all of that.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.000
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about what those years were like growing up.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.360
[Amit Varma]: Like what kind of kid were you?

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.200
[Amit Varma]: What drew you towards the sort of things that you studied?

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.980
[Amit Varma]: And in general, what were the influences around you?

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.840
[Amit Varma]: Because one of the things I realized while talking to guests who grew up around that

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.040
[Amit Varma]: time or are of that age is that, you know, young people today have all the influences

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.320
[Amit Varma]: of the world open to them.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, the whole world is at their fingertips through the Internet and whatever.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.320
[Amit Varma]: But back in the day, growing up in the 70s, 80s, even 90s, we got, you know, little driblets

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.560
[Amit Varma]: of influences from here and there.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.680
[Amit Varma]: So whatever got through to us was, you know, likely to play a big part in shaping us.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.120
[Amit Varma]: Give me a sense of that landscape of your growing up in the, you know, when you did.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.160
[Guest]: So my parents were both professors at JNU.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.440
[Guest]: And that is, at least at that time, even more so was a place where there was always a lot

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.680
[Guest]: of intellectual debate.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.640
[Guest]: There's always debate about issues, what's happening in the world.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.400
[Guest]: And you know, I was a science student till class 12.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.080
[Guest]: And I thought I would do science because I'd got the NTS.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.600
[Guest]: And you know, it was like, wow, at that time, it was very, a big achievement at that time,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.600
[Guest]: certainly.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.720
[Guest]: I was planning all the way to maybe take the JNU or something and then changed my mind

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.160
[Guest]: because the kind of debates that we would have at home and with, you know, various.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.160
[Guest]: So my mothers and fathers, students and colleagues would always be dropping in.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.320
[Guest]: And, you know, there was always a lively debate.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.160
[Guest]: And I think that's what attracted me to economics that, you know, this is something I want to

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.400
[Guest]: understand more deeply.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:06.080
[Guest]: And then instead of taking the JEE, I went and joined, I just applied for economics,

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.080
[Guest]: actually.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.080
[Guest]: Only that.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.080
[Amit Varma]: Incredible.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.080
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit about your parents.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.240
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about the kind of debates you had at home, for example.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.880
[Guest]: There would be debates about what were the reasons for whatever was happening on the

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.040
[Guest]: political scene.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.160
[Guest]: And usually it would be traced back to economics.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.720
[Guest]: And my parents were both Marxists, you know, JNU was, there was a lot of Marxism in JNU

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.720
[Guest]: at that time.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:39.480
[Guest]: So my parents were like everybody else in JNU, quite leftist.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.760
[Guest]: And they would trace almost everything that happened in history.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.520
[Guest]: My mother was a professor of philosophy and my father of African studies, African politics.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.520
[Guest]: So everything would get traced back to economics.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:57.080
[Guest]: And I mean, that's basically Marxism that it is that the economy is the base and the

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.080
[Guest]: rest of the superstructure.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.520
[Guest]: So it would go back to that.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:06.240
[Guest]: I mean, I didn't, you know, perhaps stick to many of those kind of beliefs, which I

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.000
[Guest]: think were far more rigid than they should have been.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.740
[Guest]: But in terms of trying to understand the world, that was my beginning.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.440
[Guest]: That was the place from where I started.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.320
[Amit Varma]: And I guess initially there must have then been an attraction to Marxism itself, because

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.400
[Amit Varma]: I think the attraction to all big ideas is that, hey, this explains the world so well.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.880
[Amit Varma]: And that's why you were attracted to it.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.560
[Amit Varma]: But there is a trap there that then you can try to explain everything through that.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.400
[Amit Varma]: So what was that attraction like?

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.840
[Amit Varma]: And how did you kind of get past it?

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:40.920
[Amit Varma]: Like, when did you begin to get past it and rebel as it were against your parents beliefs?

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.560
[Guest]: Only after I was only after I finished my master's.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.160
[Guest]: So while I was in college, while I was at university, anyway, you know, you think of

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.960
[Guest]: the influences at that time, the friends you have, everybody around you and at home.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:06.160
[Guest]: So those were very, very, I should say, dominant influences, both because of social circles,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.600
[Guest]: as well as the general atmosphere.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.440
[Guest]: So I did my master's at the Center for Economic Studies and Planning where, you know, we had

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:20.320
[Guest]: Prabhat Patnaik, Utsav Patnaik, now later Jayati Ghosh was my MPhil advisor.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.480
[Guest]: But you know, towards the end of my master's and beginning of my MPhil, which I did my

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.080
[Guest]: MPhil in JNU.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.800
[Guest]: So that time I started, you know, questioning too many things.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:37.240
[Guest]: So I think I'm not a person who can belong to any political party because what that requires

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.040
[Guest]: is agreeing with 100% of everything they say.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:47.800
[Guest]: So you know, regardless of which the party is, every party member is expected to, you

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.240
[Guest]: know, carry forward the party line.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.800
[Guest]: So that really didn't suit me as I questioned too many things.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.560
[Guest]: So I think that's when it became clear that no, this is not where my future lies.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, what you just said about, you know, that need for purity, we see it more and more

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:11.400
[Amit Varma]: in social media these days where, you know, you have different echo chambers forming and

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.120
[Amit Varma]: stringent enforcements of, you know, purity.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And like I always say that, you know, whenever I go on Twitter or whatever, and you see labels

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
[Amit Varma]: thrown about like socialist or libertarian or this or that, and I think all labels are

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.240
[Amit Varma]: fundamentally toxic because all labels are limiting in a particular sense.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.800
[Amit Varma]: And it's almost as if like 90% of the time, those labels are used on social media.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.320
[Amit Varma]: It's as if you're trying to put someone in a category of us or the other.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.960
[Amit Varma]: And that just makes the whole discourse very toxic.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.040
[Amit Varma]: But to kind of get back to, you know, your sort of intellectual evolution during those

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.320
[Amit Varma]: times, were there any sort of aha moments during that phase, like, of course, there

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.000
[Amit Varma]: are these little pinpricks of questionings when you're saying, wait a minute, you're

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.120
[Amit Varma]: saying this, and this doesn't seem quite right, it's surely more nuanced.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.120
[Amit Varma]: And I get that.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.840
[Amit Varma]: But were there sort of any aha moments when you look at things differently?

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.520
[Amit Varma]: Any books that kind of influenced you that way?

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:09.320
[Guest]: So I remember one moment, which was when, you know, some of the, there was some meeting

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:16.480
[Guest]: going on, and some of the leftist, leading leftist leaders were opposing infrastructure

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.600
[Guest]: development in Delhi, saying, oh, you're building these big roads and highways, and there are

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.600
[Guest]: people starving.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:29.480
[Guest]: And, you know, I stood up from wherever I was, I was maybe 19, 18, 19 or something.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.080
[Guest]: And I stood up and said, no, no, we need the roads, I stood up from the audience, and this

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.080
[Guest]: person was on stage.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.280
[Guest]: And I said, no, we need the roads, we, you know, that's how GDP will grow.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.960
[Guest]: You are not going to remove poverty without GDP growth.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.680
[Guest]: So you have to have infrastructure.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:50.040
[Guest]: And everybody was stunned, because, you know, that was not something that people said at

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.040
[Guest]: that time.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.000
[Guest]: So this is in the early 80s.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.760
[Guest]: And it was almost as if anything Western is bad, any modernization, any infrastructure

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.240
[Guest]: development, which is, you know, these big flyovers, why are you spending money on flyovers?

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.520
[Guest]: I don't remember too many other incidents, but that was one that like kind of hit me

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.600
[Guest]: that no, no, no, this is completely wrong.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.500
[Guest]: This is not what it should be.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.000
[Amit Varma]: And it also speaks to like a fundamental mindset that we've kind of had, and we still in many

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.040
[Amit Varma]: ways have, which is a very intuitive mindset of seeing the world as a zero-sum place, right?

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.840
[Amit Varma]: That if you're spending on roads, you know, you should be spending the poor instead, as

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.600
[Amit Varma]: if there is a fixed pie.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.280
[Amit Varma]: And of course, that whole zero-sum mindset plays into everything.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.880
[Amit Varma]: It plays into when you talk about redistribution vis-a-vis growth, it plays into practically

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.960
[Amit Varma]: everything that we do.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.320
[Amit Varma]: And in some cases, it needs to because the government does have a limited sum of money

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.840
[Amit Varma]: and there are opportunity costs and all of that, of course, is there.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.720
[Amit Varma]: But as far as the economy is concerned, it's dangerous to think of it that way.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.600
[Amit Varma]: Now, what I've often seen, like when I kind of grew up in the 80s, you know, I kind of

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.720
[Amit Varma]: imbibed all the typical conventional wisdom, which involves this kind of zero-sum thinking

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.760
[Amit Varma]: as well.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.820
[Amit Varma]: And it's natural to do that, one, because of course, the environment around me was that

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:10.280
[Amit Varma]: kind of proto-socialist environment, my, you know, my dad was an IAS officer, and it was

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.880
[Amit Varma]: just natural to believe in the power of the state and not think of the fatal conceit as

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.880
[Amit Varma]: it were.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.880
[Amit Varma]: But a lot of the truths about the world are deeply counterintuitive, that things are not

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.080
[Amit Varma]: zero-sum, that the economy is a positive something, that there is something called spontaneous

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.080
[Amit Varma]: order that sometimes you, you know, the government can achieve things not by trying to control

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.640
[Amit Varma]: it from the top down, but by just enabling society to solve its own problems.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.680
[Amit Varma]: But these are very counterintuitive.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.360
[Amit Varma]: So over a period of time when, you know, what was that kind of process like when you try

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.760
[Amit Varma]: to figure this stuff out?

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.600
[Amit Varma]: Were there particular books, were there thinkers who influenced you?

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.840
[Amit Varma]: Take me through a little bit of that intellectual evolution that you must have gone through.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.240
[Amit Varma]: And I guess some of it would be academics, but some of it would also be outside academics,

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.480
[Amit Varma]: just looking at things around you as it were.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.840
[Guest]: Yes, so two things really.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:09.560
[Guest]: One in terms of being in JNU and with people here, I felt very uncomfortable when I was

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.280
[Guest]: told what to think.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.240
[Guest]: I mean, being told what to say is something else, but I've been fortunate that my mother

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.280
[Guest]: was a PhD in philosophy and a professor of philosophy.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.560
[Guest]: And I had been taught to question, question, question, question, question from, you know,

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.840
[Guest]: from the day I was born, I was taught to question.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:35.320
[Guest]: And so I became quite uncomfortable when I was told to accept things because I was being

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.440
[Guest]: told something.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.040
[Guest]: And so that was one, you know, in terms of the environment, that was the one thing that

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.400
[Guest]: I rebelled against.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:49.600
[Guest]: And I find myself very uncomfortable in situations when people tell me what to think.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.760
[Guest]: But I think the second was going for my PhD to a completely different system.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.520
[Guest]: So I went to the UK for my PhD.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:03.680
[Guest]: I got this Commonwealth Nehru Centenary Fellowship, which after JNU, which was a big, big change.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:10.720
[Guest]: So the things that one learned, the things one saw, my PhD advisor, everything, you know,

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.160
[Guest]: helped in making me think very, very differently.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:20.720
[Guest]: So I should say I came back a very different person, in my mind, I came back different,

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.160
[Guest]: thought differently, completely.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.600
[Amit Varma]: And how did your parents react to that?

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:31.240
[Amit Varma]: The fact that, you know, you're no longer the obedient little Marxist girl, but you've

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.240
[Amit Varma]: become something else.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.000
[Guest]: No, they were okay with it.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.120
[Guest]: I mean, the way that, you know, the fundamental principle was that you have to think for yourself,

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.120
[Guest]: not for my parents.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.480
[Guest]: So, you know, for the others, it might be different, but for my parents, it was that

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.320
[Guest]: you have to think for yourself.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.560
[Guest]: And no matter what you think, whether you agree or you disagree, the most important

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.720
[Guest]: thing is that you think for yourself and not say or do things that you're told to do.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:01.440
[Guest]: In fact, my father, right from my childhood, discouraged me to join the bureaucracy.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:07.360
[Guest]: So he said, no, this is not something for you because, you know, you question too much.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.920
[Guest]: I was perhaps the only one in my master's class who did not take the UPSC exam because

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.280
[Guest]: at that time there weren't many jobs around.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.560
[Guest]: So almost everybody was taking these competitive exams.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.160
[Guest]: But, you know, my father was, no, you have to think for yourself and this is not something

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:29.800
[Guest]: you can do if you are part of a bureaucracy, which I understand very well.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.120
[Guest]: So yes, they were fine with it.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.120
[Amit Varma]: That's wonderful.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.760
[Amit Varma]: It strikes me that every good economist is not just shaped by the study of economics,

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.920
[Amit Varma]: but also whatever other influences they're kind of exposed to.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.460
[Amit Varma]: And on the one hand, you have like your mom is a professor of philosophy, you're questioning

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:51.080
[Amit Varma]: things like you said, too, I would imagine that, you know, because we had these political

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.800
[Amit Varma]: discussions at home and so on and so forth, there would also have been a very keen focus

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.040
[Amit Varma]: in your mind on the intersection of economics in the real world.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.560
[Amit Varma]: It's not just something that you're studying, it's something that actually affects lives

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.800
[Amit Varma]: like in that early example of, you know, fighting for roads.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.240
[Amit Varma]: So you know, if you were to then look at that, what are the different kinds of things that

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.680
[Amit Varma]: shape the economist you are apart from the economics, like part of it would, I'm guessing,

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.960
[Amit Varma]: be the politics, was there reading that went into it?

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, give me a sort of a fuller sense of yourself, if I may ask.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:28.120
[Guest]: One of the most important things, apart from, you know, reading books and things which naturally

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.760
[Guest]: you can imagine, you know, being in a house surrounded by books, one did that.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.960
[Guest]: But I think one of the very important things was this daily reading of newspapers from

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.440
[Guest]: childhood.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.680
[Guest]: And I think many people don't perhaps do that.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.840
[Guest]: And so maybe they're not so connected with the world and with the country.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.360
[Guest]: But if you're doing that every day, and if you're sitting around, you know, the dinner

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:57.120
[Guest]: table talking about what happened and why it happened, and you're doing that at breakfast,

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.720
[Guest]: you're doing that at dinner.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.200
[Guest]: So you know, you do that day after day.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.780
[Guest]: I think that really makes a difference to who you are and what you want to do.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.800
[Guest]: So if you know, you kind of get into that, that I don't just want to interpret the world,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:16.480
[Guest]: I want to change it, but not necessarily by a communist revolution.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:22.500
[Guest]: But it just goes in so deep that when you see problems, so you know, when you grow up,

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:29.560
[Guest]: you want to like, for me, I've always worked on last 20 years, 25 years, my entire working

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:35.840
[Guest]: life as an economist has been working on real problems that are there in the economy, and

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:41.440
[Guest]: not on something, you know, abstract or something very far away.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.480
[Guest]: So it's been working on those problems, and then trying to work towards solutions wherever

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.440
[Guest]: one could find those and working towards that.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.440
[Guest]: And I think that's the influence really.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.800
[Amit Varma]: And were the newspapers you read English newspapers?

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.240
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.760
[Amit Varma]: So we used to get let me let me ask you a question not quite related to economics, but

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.320
[Amit Varma]: it's come up on my show before and it came up recently, like one of my friends recently

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.080
[Amit Varma]: posted on Twitter, where he kind of lamented that we are such a divided nation today.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.080
[Amit Varma]: And I don't remember us being so divided in the 80s and the 90s.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.880
[Amit Varma]: And you know, and my point there was that no, we were always divided, we were just in

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.640
[Amit Varma]: a bubble and the bubble wasn't divided, but we were in a bubble where we didn't kind of

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.420
[Amit Varma]: see the rest of the country.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.200
[Amit Varma]: And I've had guests on the show before, like Akshay Mukul, who wrote the book on the Gita

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.160
[Amit Varma]: Press and the political scientist, Rahul Verma.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.440
[Amit Varma]: And one of the interesting points I got while talking to them was that growing up they read

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.640
[Amit Varma]: newspapers in Hindi, and, you know, other guests have read newspapers in their languages.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.840
[Amit Varma]: And their contention was that because they were not just reading, you know, English newspapers,

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.960
[Amit Varma]: they could see outside the elite bubble, they got a sense of what the other India as it

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.480
[Amit Varma]: were, was also like to them.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:58.400
[Amit Varma]: In fact, this upsurge of Hindutva is not an aberration, but you know, it was always there,

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.960
[Amit Varma]: it was always kind of coming up.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.920
[Amit Varma]: And I don't want to ask you about the politics in particular.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.960
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is, even I grew up in a similar elite bubble to yours, I'm guessing where

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.160
[Amit Varma]: you're just reading everything in English, and you're mixing with a certain kind of people

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.640
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:17.280
[Amit Varma]: And at what point does one sort of get awareness of that bubble and be able to actually see

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.640
[Amit Varma]: outside like not in a sense of intellectually knowing that, yeah, you know, there are, you

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.920
[Amit Varma]: know, there's a world out there that is different, but, you know, actually in terms of getting

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.200
[Amit Varma]: it engaging with it.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:35.760
[Guest]: I think I was fortunate because my parents, being communists, they would be people who

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.880
[Guest]: would be coming straight from villages, so they were not like they were not leaders,

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.600
[Guest]: they were not active, but just, you know, the fact that they were JNU professors, people

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.760
[Guest]: would come to them, meet them.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.960
[Guest]: Many of my father's students would, you know, couldn't speak a word of English, would be

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.400
[Guest]: right straight from a village.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.800
[Guest]: We also had a, there was a reservation system in JNU.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.840
[Guest]: So that encouraged, they used to give points for coming from a backward region, from a

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.560
[Guest]: lower income category, and the rest.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.680
[Guest]: And that would encourage a lot of people to come.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.000
[Guest]: So I think that I was fortunate that I wasn't, I mean, of course, English newspapers were

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.240
[Guest]: something that, you know, you read what you get at home.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:19.680
[Guest]: We used to get, I think, one Hindi Jan Satta or something, Hindi paper on Sundays.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.480
[Guest]: But you know, you and I didn't have a choice.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.680
[Guest]: We were born into the family, we were born in and we read the papers that our parents

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.680
[Guest]: bought.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:33.240
[Guest]: But, you know, I was fortunate in that sense that there was a mix of people and a lot of

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:41.000
[Guest]: them not elite coming from backgrounds, which and my mother particularly used to, you know,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.680
[Guest]: encourage them to come home to her students when they came from backgrounds where they

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.840
[Guest]: had huge gaps also in their learning.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.280
[Guest]: So they would be sitting and, you know, working with her and studying.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:58.480
[Guest]: So I was fortunate not to, you know, be in a complete bubble and to be able to interact

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.520
[Guest]: with people from all over the country and from different backgrounds.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:08.400
[Amit Varma]: And how did your conception of yourself during these years kind of evolve like for a lot

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.840
[Amit Varma]: of people, certainly for me, it's very shaky early on.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:15.880
[Amit Varma]: It takes many years to get to somewhere where you can kind of begin to think of yourself

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.880
[Amit Varma]: as well.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.880
[Amit Varma]: These are the things I want to do.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.520
[Amit Varma]: And this is a place I want to occupy in the world and all of that.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.360
[Amit Varma]: And yet it seems just looking at your bare biographical details where you do your BA

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:30.160
[Amit Varma]: in economics from Hindu and then your MA and your MPhil from JNU and then you go to the

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.840
[Amit Varma]: University of Surrey and you do your PhD and then you come back here.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.520
[Amit Varma]: And just looking at the bare bones of that, it seems that okay, you kind of got it figured

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.220
[Amit Varma]: out that you want to learn economics the best you can.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.520
[Amit Varma]: And then you want to kind of work within India and try to actually make a difference in the

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.520
[Amit Varma]: real world.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.520
[Amit Varma]: Was it always kind of like that?

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.120
[Amit Varma]: Or did your conception of self evolve?

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:55.320
[Amit Varma]: Like at what point did it firm up and what is that conception of self in a sense?

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.520
[Guest]: Well, to begin with, what is that conception?

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.120
[Guest]: It is that I try to do what I can, I try to understand what I can.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:10.160
[Guest]: And as I said, one has been, I guess, brought up in a way that it's almost as if every problem

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.060
[Guest]: is one's own responsibility.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.560
[Guest]: So if you see a problem, you don't ignore it.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.320
[Guest]: You study it, you understand it and you see if there is a way out.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.240
[Guest]: And in economic policy, there are so many problems.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:26.840
[Guest]: And particularly when one is coming from a background where, as a country, when we are

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:32.000
[Guest]: coming from a background where we had almost stopped people from doing anything, there

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.580
[Guest]: were so many restrictions, then it's a great place to study economics and understand what's

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.580
[Guest]: going on.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:44.200
[Guest]: Because you see where the restrictions are removed, what happens and when they are not,

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.600
[Guest]: then what happens.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:52.000
[Guest]: And then it's also if you are in that space where, so I always wanted to write and I started

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.080
[Guest]: writing right after my PhD and once I started working on the Indian economy.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:04.540
[Guest]: So you are in a place where you can study it and at least, the least one can do is write

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:09.460
[Guest]: about those issues and help everybody understand your point of view.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:15.580
[Guest]: So I'm not in the bureaucracy or a politician who can actually be the ones who decide that

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.480
[Guest]: change happens.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:25.000
[Guest]: But it happens because of ideas, because one writes and people listen and read and if one

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.640
[Guest]: is able to speak in a language that is simple and convey what one thinks, then people get

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:36.680
[Guest]: convinced and you know, then that's what makes life meaningful.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:42.460
[Amit Varma]: And how important is that role as a public intellectual in the sense that you are an

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.920
[Amit Varma]: economist at the same time, you're someone who has worked with the government at different

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.040
[Amit Varma]: times as an advisor and so on and so forth.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.120
[Amit Varma]: At the same time, you've written prolifically, you've done forays into audiovisual, you know,

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.280
[Amit Varma]: for example, you had policy with Patnaik, your show for NDTV more than a decade ago

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.760
[Amit Varma]: and now you do Elonomics and you know, the other stuff that you do for the print, like

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.280
[Amit Varma]: a lot of people will write a lot because it kind of helps them in their thinking process

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.920
[Amit Varma]: that you know, as they write, they learn more about a subject and it's something they want

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.920
[Amit Varma]: to do.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.600
[Amit Varma]: And another way of looking at it is that look, if I want to make a difference, that difference

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.040
[Amit Varma]: also comes from getting these ideas out there in the discourse.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:24.160
[Amit Varma]: And one of the issues with this, I'm guessing for you would have been that the discourse

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.560
[Amit Varma]: is kind of stunted.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.520
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, some of the things that you say at different points in time, and certainly

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.000
[Amit Varma]: I would imagine it would be the case in the 90s, are just not out there, right?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.760
[Amit Varma]: So what has this process been for you?

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.920
[Amit Varma]: Like, do you do you see it as, you know, part of your duty almost to do this stuff, to have

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.760
[Guest]: this public facing face as well?

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.120
[Guest]: Yes, absolutely.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:50.180
[Guest]: So I get a stomachache if I don't say what I am thinking, if I don't write.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:54.640
[Guest]: So I've always, you know, been writing, I used to have a column in the Business Standard

00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.520
[Guest]: and the Indian Express and, you know, apart from the TV show and the print column that

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.880
[Guest]: I'm doing now.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.720
[Guest]: So it's almost, it's a part of me.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.600
[Guest]: I mean, now I've done it for so long.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.360
[Guest]: I started writing my columns in 99.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:13.280
[Guest]: So it's just been, you know, too many years for me to even think of myself as separate

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.280
[Unknown]: from that.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.840
[Guest]: It was very painful during when I was in government, I was told not to write, I had to stop writing.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.880
[Guest]: So for a year and a half, of course, they kept me so busy that it didn't, you know,

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.880
[Guest]: hurt too much.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.480
[Guest]: And some of the things I was doing was what I had been writing about.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.680
[Guest]: So it didn't hurt that much.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:36.960
[Guest]: But yeah, it's very difficult to be somebody who doesn't, isn't thinking, isn't worrying,

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.280
[Guest]: isn't talking, isn't trying to convince, isn't trying to help other people to understand.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.480
[Guest]: So it's very much completely a part of me.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:51.240
[Guest]: I mean, I'm just fortunate that I'm in a situation where I have the freedom to do so, where I'm

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:56.400
[Guest]: able to do so, where I have the time and the luxury because, you know, many jobs don't

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.040
[Guest]: even give you the time to do that.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.320
[Guest]: So fortunately, you know, we are able to do that.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:06.160
[Guest]: So it's a good place to be in.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.760
[Amit Varma]: And for people who care about ideas, I guess, especially people who engage deeply with policy

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.560
[Amit Varma]: like you do, I guess there is a sort of a dual imperative, which for many people is

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.160
[Amit Varma]: an either or where on the one hand, when you look at the political marketplace, what you're

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:25.860
[Amit Varma]: saying is that I want to be able to influence the decision makers to make the right decisions.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.440
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, you're looking at the demand end of the political marketplace and

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.880
[Amit Varma]: saying that I want to get my ideas out in the public domain, where you know, they can

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.560
[Amit Varma]: hopefully change the discourse and then the change at the top can happen later.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.980
[Amit Varma]: And you're someone who's kind of been trying to do this simultaneously.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:46.160
[Amit Varma]: And I would just imagine thinking aloud, that this then almost creates two contradictory

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.320
[Amit Varma]: pressures that when you're working with policy makers, and when you're working with government,

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.320
[Amit Varma]: you have to moderate your ideas, you have to talk about incremental steps go one step

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.320
[Amit Varma]: at a time.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:00.300
[Amit Varma]: But when you're trying to get your ideas out into the public domain, there is perhaps the

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:06.160
[Amit Varma]: urge to kind of just lay it all out as it is, because you know, why that urge to moderation?

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.680
[Amit Varma]: Why not move that Overton window as it were?

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.640
[Amit Varma]: So is this something that you've thought about?

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.720
[Amit Varma]: Or is it that you've managed to reconcile these easily?

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.720
[Guest]: Yes.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.080
[Guest]: So usually I end up saying things many years before the world is ready to hear them.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:23.800
[Guest]: So you know, things like inflation targeting, which I started writing about in 2006.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.440
[Guest]: And then finally, it happened in 2016.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.840
[Guest]: So and there are many such examples, you know, talking about business cycles, microstabilization,

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.000
[Guest]: many, many, most of my work.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.400
[Guest]: So you know, when nobody listens, and it's okay, you get a bit disappointed, you get

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:43.120
[Guest]: but that's life, you know, and if you obsess on it, and you go on for some time, and then

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.120
[Guest]: you realize, okay, nobody's listening.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:51.840
[Guest]: So you step back and you say, okay, let me write about something that people talk about.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.400
[Guest]: But then every once in a while, you get an opportunity, you know, there's a peg, and

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.400
[Guest]: you get an opportunity and you write about some of the things that are dearest to you.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:06.480
[Guest]: But you know, there's not that much of a contradiction and conflict that I feel because most of the

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:14.040
[Guest]: time, one is able to interpret and understand things because of a understanding of the larger

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.760
[Guest]: picture.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.160
[Guest]: And then you write and talk about those.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:23.440
[Guest]: So when let's say there is a capital control that is imposed, which is completely arbitrary

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.920
[Guest]: and which you know is going to hurt, you know, these things keep happening.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:34.680
[Guest]: So in a sense, policymakers are constantly for the last 20 years, giving me opportunities

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.600
[Guest]: week after week, to be able to say something.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.480
[Guest]: So which come out of that broader understanding.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.920
[Guest]: So there's not that much of a conflict, it gives me, you know, little things give me

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.800
[Guest]: opportunities to put my ideas across.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.320
[Amit Varma]: So when you came back to India after doing your PhD, what was your thinking?

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.240
[Amit Varma]: What was the kind of work that you wanted to do? because one would imagine that for

00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:00.160
[Amit Varma]: many people, a natural progression then is to just become an academic outside somewhere

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.200
[Amit Varma]: and kind of chill and live a charmed life and do papers and all of that.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.760
[Amit Varma]: But you actually came back.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.280
[Amit Varma]: So what was your thinking?

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.280
[Amit Varma]: What did you want to do?

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.560
[Amit Varma]: Were you were you kind of clear about the path ahead?

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.040
[Guest]: And is that more or less the path that you've taken?

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.240
[Guest]: Pretty much, pretty much.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:20.680
[Guest]: So I wanted not to be teaching because when I was teaching before I left, I was teaching

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.560
[Guest]: at Stephens and it was, you know, it was a heavy workload.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.600
[Guest]: And one didn't really get time to do research.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:33.880
[Guest]: And I wanted to do research after my PhD and not teach because, you know, there they may

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.720
[Guest]: still be an environment where you get a lot of time off.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.520
[Guest]: But here, at least, you know, it's very difficult.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.760
[Guest]: So I wanted to work for a think tank.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.520
[Guest]: And I joined in CAER, National Council of Applied Economic Research.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:54.360
[Guest]: And I got to work on the Indian economy, which for me was just what I wanted to do.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.920
[Guest]: My PhD had been on a closed economy model because when I had left India and all the

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.960
[Guest]: experience one had was closed economy.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.640
[Guest]: So I'd gone in 91 for my PhD.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.200
[Guest]: And by 96, it was an open economy.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.700
[Guest]: So though my PhD was on a closed economy model, it was an endogenous growth model.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:20.840
[Guest]: But I had been teaching there in Surrey and then learnt open economy macro while teaching

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.640
[Guest]: because that's what macro teaching there was.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.280
[Guest]: It was all open economy.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:31.040
[Guest]: So here, when I came back, I think it was just the perfect thing for me that, you know,

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.960
[Guest]: nobody else was particularly studying open economy macro for India in 96.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.200
[Guest]: The economy had barely opened up.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.240
[Guest]: Very few people had actually even been trained in open economy macro.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.800
[Guest]: Macro itself had gone out of fashion.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.120
[Guest]: So, you know, things had been okay in the rest of the world for a while.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:54.520
[Guest]: And when Indians went to do PhDs abroad, they did development economics, very few did macro.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:33:02.480
[Guest]: So it was a complete virgin territory, you know, one could do open economy macro, understand

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:07.280
[Guest]: the Indian economy through the perspective of open economy macro because the economy

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.680
[Guest]: was opening up.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.560
[Guest]: And almost all the problems that were arising.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:21.600
[Guest]: So I had two projects at NCEI, one was on business cycles, and the other was on exchange

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.560
[Guest]: rates and interest rates.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.560
[Guest]: So financial markets.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:31.120
[Guest]: So I was very fortunate to get these two to start working on because this is all three.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:36.560
[Guest]: I mean, this is really where all the knowledge of everything that I had studied in open economy

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.860
[Guest]: macro could be applied.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:45.760
[Guest]: So I was very fortunate that, you know, I was tooled up, I understood the impossible

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:50.680
[Guest]: trinity, which many people here still hadn't even started reading.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:58.600
[Guest]: And I was able to apply those and study, you know, the Indian economy from a new perspective.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.000
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit more about this impossible trinity.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.560
[Guest]: See, when you're in closed economy, what does a closed economy mean?

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:10.360
[Guest]: You trade, but you don't have capital account openness, you don't allow capital flows.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.960
[Guest]: What are capital flows?

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:17.120
[Guest]: Cross-border flows of money for sale or purchase of assets.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.320
[Guest]: So you don't allow those, you allow trade.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.320
[Guest]: That's the current account.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.960
[Guest]: Your current account is open.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:27.280
[Guest]: Then what you can do is that you can hike your interest rates as much as you like.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:32.440
[Guest]: And money may come in, money could have come in if it had been an open economy.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.160
[Guest]: But because you're closed, nothing happens.

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:41.120
[Guest]: You can fix your exchange rate, you can fix your interest rate, so you can have both.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.400
[Guest]: Not that the economy had too many business cycles, they just had monsoon cycles before

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.400
[Guest]: 91.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.560
[Guest]: But if you needed to hike interest rates for any reason or lower interest rates for any

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:57.640
[Guest]: reason, you don't have to worry about the effect that that will have on exchange rates.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.800
[Guest]: But now if the economy becomes open, then capital can flow in.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:08.240
[Guest]: Let's say if interest rates go up in India and capital flows in, then that's going to

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.840
[Guest]: appreciate your exchange rate.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.000
[Guest]: If capital flows out, that is going to weaken your currency.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.400
[Guest]: Now the impossible trinity says that these are the three corners of the trinity, an open

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:24.440
[Guest]: capital account, monetary policy independence, that is you determine what your interest rate

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.240
[Guest]: is going to be, and exchange rate policy.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.960
[Guest]: So you cannot have all three at the same time.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.840
[Guest]: If you close the capital account, then yes, you can have the other two.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.640
[Guest]: But once the capital account opens, then you can't have those two.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.640
[Guest]: So that's the trinity.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.400
[Amit Varma]: And among sort of economic policy makers in the country, you would imagine that they've

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.880
[Amit Varma]: been used to decades of thinking about the economy in a particular way, which is threat

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.160
[Amit Varma]: hold, command and control, closed economy, blah, blah, blah.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:58.360
[Amit Varma]: Now, through circumstances or whatever, you know, the balance of payments crisis and blah,

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.200
[Amit Varma]: blah, we've actually opened it up.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.120
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, a few people have made some reforms.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.880
[Amit Varma]: But does the mindset shift over time?

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:10.920
[Amit Varma]: Like, one of the things that I think about is that yes, 91 is seminal in the sense that

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:15.560
[Amit Varma]: we opened so much up, but at the same time, you know, it's it's very partial in terms

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.120
[Amit Varma]: of what we could have done.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:22.160
[Amit Varma]: And also what I can't put my finger on is that is there a mindset shift at all?

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.400
[Amit Varma]: Because after that initial impetus, it seems to me that inertia sets in again.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.560
[Amit Varma]: And further reforms, you know, sort of slow down.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:35.440
[Amit Varma]: So in just in terms of the mindset, both within the government and within economists who are

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:40.520
[Amit Varma]: working here, what is you know, how are how are they adapting?

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.860
[Amit Varma]: You know, how are they noticing like you pointed out that how it's a delightful time to study

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:50.520
[Amit Varma]: economics because it's almost like these experiments where you had a control and then the control

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:55.040
[Amit Varma]: gets removed and you can see exactly what the consequences and there are so many insights

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.560
[Amit Varma]: because there are so many things changing.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.840
[Amit Varma]: But you know, you're a young person who is forming at that moment in time, I would imagine

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:06.640
[Amit Varma]: that everyone who is a major economic commentator at the time or is in government there in the

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:12.800
[Amit Varma]: 40s and 50s, settled ways of thinking, is that an issue when you are in this landscape,

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.400
[Amit Varma]: looking around studying these things that really no one in India is studying because

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:21.960
[Amit Varma]: like you said, they're doing development economics and, you know, hunger and nutrition and redistribution

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:22.960
[Amit Varma]: and all that.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.960
[Amit Varma]: What is it like, you know, are you someone who kind of stands apart?

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.840
[Guest]: Yeah, very lonely, I would say very difficult and very lonely.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:41.920
[Guest]: So if I give you a concrete example, when we opened up in 91, after opening up the current

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:47.760
[Guest]: account in about 93-94, we started opening the capital account and we started getting

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:55.560
[Guest]: a lot of FII investment and that meant that the rupee started appreciating and RBI started

00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:01.400
[Guest]: buying dollars, they didn't, they just bought dollars, unsterilized, I mean, they just bought

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.400
[Guest]: dollars.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:06.940
[Guest]: So the money supply in the economy increased and they started getting inflation.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:13.320
[Guest]: So by mid-96 or so, we started getting a lot of inflationary pressures.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:21.200
[Guest]: But the mindset was that this has nothing to do with opening up or should we allow exchange

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.200
[Guest]: rate flexibility, should we not try to fix the exchange rate.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:31.920
[Guest]: You know, the exchange rate stayed at 31.36 for 16 months after we made it flexible.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:40.360
[Guest]: So we said now the exchange rate is no longer administered and we are moving to a floating

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.040
[Guest]: managed float, but it stayed at 31.36.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:49.880
[Guest]: Now in those 16 months, RBI was busy buying up dollars and because they had understood

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.960
[Guest]: so little, they were not sterilizing them.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:57.560
[Guest]: So back to back, in other words, in our audience, we're not used to the word sterilized intervention

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.560
[Guest]: by the central bank.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:04.080
[Guest]: It basically means that you buy foreign currency and so in your monetary base, you're adding

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.080
[Guest]: to your monetary base by buying foreign currency because for every rupee you buy, you've issued,

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:14.000
[Guest]: sorry, for every dollar you buy, you've issued a number of rupees.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.800
[Guest]: If you sterilize it, which means that if you're worrying about the impact it's going to have

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:25.320
[Guest]: on the monetary base, then you sell government bonds and you pull that money back so that

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:30.760
[Guest]: you don't let liquidity in the economy increase.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.440
[Guest]: You know, it was early days, they also had no experience.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:39.960
[Guest]: So they did unsterilized intervention and there was just very little understanding of

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.400
[Guest]: what was going on.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:46.760
[Guest]: And then they started talking about that we are building reserves, that we're doing this

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.140
[Guest]: because we are building reserves.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.360
[Guest]: It sounded very good to everybody in government.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.360
[Guest]: Why?

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:57.720
[Guest]: Because in this 91 crisis where, you know, that whole story, I'm sure everybody has heard

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:02.960
[Guest]: it a thousand times, but the story that India mortgaged a plane full of gold and we went

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.200
[Guest]: with a begging bowl when we didn't have even 15 days worth of imports left, that story

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.920
[Guest]: would be told again and again.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:13.240
[Guest]: And it would be said that, oh, so we are just, you know, we want to be safe, so we are buying

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.240
[Guest]: reserves.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:19.920
[Guest]: People would justify holding those reserves by saying, oh, there is this in month rule,

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:25.360
[Guest]: in month of import cover, there's this guidotti rule that we should have be holding so much

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:30.560
[Guest]: of reserves or we, you know, there's so much hot money in, so we should be holding reserves

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.760
[Guest]: for that.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.960
[Guest]: But essentially what was happening was that they were buying reserves to manipulate the

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:36.960
[Guest]: rupee.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.040
[Guest]: They were just buying dollars because we are getting too much of an inflow of dollars.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.680
[Guest]: And this kind of continued for a while.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:48.960
[Guest]: And it was not that there was any great understanding of what is reserve adequacy and how much reserves

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.120
[Guest]: would be held.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:54.440
[Guest]: So if one said that, look, this is an embarrassment of riches.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:59.600
[Guest]: I mean, I remember the phrase because I had a business standard column and, you know,

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:04.200
[Guest]: the editor had very nicely found this nice, you know, that the titles are given by the

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.200
[Guest]: page editor.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.920
[Guest]: So it was the embarrassment of riches.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.920
[Guest]: And you know, when one tried to say that, look, you don't need these, you're holding

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:12.920
[Guest]: too much.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:18.920
[Guest]: I remember this was came up in a Nimrana conference, my first Nimrana conference where I said,

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.800
[Guest]: look, this is becoming like Food Corporation of India.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:26.680
[Guest]: You know, you're just buying up something because it's there and then you won't be able

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.680
[Guest]: to get rid of it.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:34.560
[Guest]: You try selling your reserves like you try to sell your wheat and your prices will drop.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:39.800
[Guest]: So what we are doing is not thought through policy.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:45.460
[Guest]: But you know, of course, people became very unhappy, particularly the RBI.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:52.400
[Guest]: So Dr. Rakesh Mohan used to be my boss at NCIR, he was the director general.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.880
[Guest]: And so I knew him very well.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:42:00.200
[Guest]: And so he would tell me that, oh, you know, every Wednesday, we read what Hazira said

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.200
[Guest]: now.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:05.280
[Guest]: So they were not happy.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.320
[Amit Varma]: Because the RBI is going to come calling and they're going to, what was the pushback like

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.320
[Amit Varma]: in those days?

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.800
[Amit Varma]: Like, what were the other big battles?

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:16.240
[Amit Varma]: One, of course, is this, as you pointed out with the RBI regarding inflation and so on.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.160
[Amit Varma]: But what were your through the years?

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.960
[Amit Varma]: What were your other kind of, you know, big battles like in terms of mindset and did that

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.560
[Amit Varma]: mindset ever begin to change?

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:28.320
[Guest]: There are many more people today who agree on many of these issues.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:34.360
[Guest]: So among the other battles, one, for example, has been a later one, but one has been the

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.240
[Guest]: Debt Management Office that we needed bond market.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.240
[Guest]: India needs a bond market.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:45.400
[Guest]: I mean, I thought that's something that everybody would very easily agree with that.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.720
[Guest]: I'm saying we need a bond market.

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.520
[Guest]: I'm not saying we need a corporate bond market.

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.520
[Guest]: OK.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:56.720
[Guest]: Now, to me, it seems obvious that if the government bond market and the corporate bond market

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.600
[Guest]: are two different markets, you don't have liquidity, you don't have the players.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.640
[Guest]: But you'll see a lot of people talk about a corporate bond market.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:11.240
[Guest]: But when it comes to having a bond market, then because, you know, there's this issue

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.320
[Guest]: of RBI is the regulator in the government bond market.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.440
[Guest]: So there's a lot of pushback.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.560
[Guest]: RBI is not just the regulator.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:23.480
[Guest]: They own the depository, they own the exchange, and, you know, they are themselves trading

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:28.240
[Guest]: on that market and they are issuing securities for the government.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.360
[Guest]: So there is a lot of pushback on some of these.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:36.760
[Guest]: And I think a lot of that pushback is because of the fact that people don't like to see

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.760
[Guest]: change.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.960
[Amit Varma]: They're kind of stuck in the inertia and their ways of thinking.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:45.520
[Amit Varma]: I'm trying to, you know, one question I've kind of had, and I know it's complicated.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.560
[Amit Varma]: What has been our direction since 91, since today?

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.240
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, there's not one answer to that.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:55.480
[Amit Varma]: And even within the question, I mean it in multiple ways, like what is there a directionality

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.140
[Amit Varma]: when we can talk about mindsets?

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:03.160
[Amit Varma]: And this would involve like mindsets in government, this would involve mindsets, you know, in

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.280
[Amit Varma]: the general discourse outside.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.520
[Amit Varma]: Because one of the things that seems to me is that, okay, we made some reforms, which

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.940
[Amit Varma]: we had to in 91, and those happened.

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.640
[Amit Varma]: And after that, everything was sporadic.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.360
[Amit Varma]: There were moments where there were impulses towards reform, where individuals kind of

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.860
[Amit Varma]: tried to do things.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:24.120
[Amit Varma]: But in general, inertia set in again, and our default thinking has remained that the

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:27.200
[Amit Varma]: thinking that the state has to have control of everything.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:32.240
[Amit Varma]: And you've kind of straddled this entire landscape, right, both as someone who's been in policy,

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.720
[Amit Varma]: studying economics, and as a public intellectual of sorts.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.920
[Amit Varma]: So you know, what has that movement been like?

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.080
[Amit Varma]: Has it been one step forward, one step backward?

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.080
[Amit Varma]: Give me a sense of it.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.300
[Guest]: I think it's been a very difficult journey for reforms.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:54.960
[Guest]: So if I'm a reform set out on a journey, then I'm not gathering too much moss.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.920
[Guest]: There aren't too many people who are moving with me.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:03.800
[Guest]: Again, you know, I think there are tough wars, there are vested interests.

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.520
[Guest]: So that is what holds back.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:11.640
[Guest]: So it's not so much that people don't understand, I think that there are vested interests, and

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.480
[Guest]: then people pull back on reforms.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.600
[Guest]: So I mean, giving you this example that I was just giving about the bond market.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:25.240
[Guest]: So what we were trying to do for a long time, for a very long time, I mean, RBI had also

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:31.040
[Guest]: proposed it, government was trying for a very long time is to set up an independent debt

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:36.800
[Guest]: management office, so that that would, you know, that usually when we look around, then

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.400
[Guest]: countries have done that.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.000
[Guest]: Most countries, not every country, but most countries have done that.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.680
[Guest]: And that really helps in building your bond market.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:49.640
[Guest]: And, you know, so if you look, I'm just giving you this example, because I'm more familiar

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:54.360
[Guest]: with the reforms in the financial sector than in any other space.

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.960
[Guest]: So what happened?

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:04.880
[Guest]: Finance Minister Jaitley, even he tabled the bill in Parliament, there's so much pushback.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:11.720
[Guest]: And then, because politicians also have, I guess, limited capital, political capital,

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:16.560
[Guest]: that they don't want to use it on something that is not going to give them immediate returns.

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.080
[Guest]: The bill was withdrawn.

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:28.200
[Guest]: And you know, after years of pushing this, finally having it tabled in Parliament, and

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:35.440
[Guest]: then, you know, when the budget was to be, this is the 2015 budget, when the budget was

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:39.560
[Guest]: to be voted upon, that day, the finance minister rolled it back.

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:44.600
[Guest]: And this was a reform that the country needed, that the country still needs.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.800
[Guest]: But you know, it's not on the table anymore.

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.760
[Guest]: Many things don't even come to the table.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.920
[Guest]: At least this was a bill that had been tabled.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.320
[Guest]: But many things don't come to the table.

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:59.320
[Guest]: There are others like the FRDI bill, the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance bill that

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.480
[Guest]: went to Standing Committee.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:07.040
[Guest]: There was a lot of pushback from, you know, public sector banks who said, oh, this means

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.880
[Guest]: that all these banks will be taken over, and all kinds of rumors were floated about the

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.480
[Guest]: Bill in Clause, about the amount of deposit insurance, all kinds of things which were

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.720
[Guest]: completely incorrect.

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:20.160
[Guest]: But that led to the bill being withdrawn.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:26.320
[Guest]: So pushbacks happen, I think, not just because of the mindset.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:31.440
[Guest]: Of course, I completely agree with you, as I was saying that there is a mindset issue

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.720
[Guest]: as well.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:44.320
[Guest]: But that mindset is actually used, used in the sense of taken, made you, you know, misused

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:50.080
[Guest]: by those who have vested interests, and they managed to push back.

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.000
[Guest]: And that's why I think a lot of things don't happen.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.280
[Guest]: Many things have been stuck at very early stages for years, but they don't go through.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.080
[Amit Varma]: So I have a couple of bigger questions I want to get to from here.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:07.440
[Amit Varma]: And the first one has a smaller question before it, in fact, which is sort of the definition

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.440
[Amit Varma]: of reforms.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.640
[Amit Varma]: Like, if we are to define reforms, it seems to me that most reforms would go in one fundamental

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:19.320
[Amit Varma]: direction, which is that our state has been too top heavy, it's been too oppressive.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:23.400
[Amit Varma]: And many reforms are just getting out of the way, letting society solve its own problems,

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.960
[Amit Varma]: letting markets work and all of that.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.920
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of the 91 reforms were exactly about this.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:32.800
[Amit Varma]: Now, this leads me to the first of my questions, which is that if one of the things that reforms

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:39.320
[Amit Varma]: are supposed to do is reduce the power of the state, and you know, empower common people,

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:43.880
[Amit Varma]: then given that the state is supposed to make these reforms, doesn't it make reforms in

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.180
[Amit Varma]: a sense impossible that there is always going to be pushback.

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:53.360
[Amit Varma]: And unless you have, say, a transformative moment of crisis like 1991, that reforms are

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:58.660
[Amit Varma]: just going to be very unusual, because they go against all incentives of anyone in a position

00:48:58.660 --> 00:48:59.660
[Amit Varma]: of power.

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:03.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, of course, the mindset issue is one issue that, you know, most of them will believe

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:07.760
[Amit Varma]: by conviction that this is the right way that the state should control everything.

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:12.880
[Amit Varma]: But even if that were not the case, you know, when is the state ever going to give up power?

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.560
[Amit Varma]: So is that something that you kind of think about?

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.800
[Guest]: Yeah, I think, yeah, yeah.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:24.520
[Guest]: But you know, I think that sometimes what happens is that the politician can see five

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:30.400
[Guest]: years ahead, whereas the bureaucrat is seeing maybe the next six months until his retirement,

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.100
[Guest]: and he's being risk averse and not doing anything.

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:40.480
[Guest]: But the politician can see a little bit further ahead, he does have to win elections again.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:46.460
[Guest]: And you know, parties can see not just five years ahead, but even further, because they

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:48.380
[Guest]: have to grow and stay.

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:53.440
[Guest]: So I'm not saying that they all understand what is to be done, there is often lack of

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.920
[Guest]: understanding and, you know, expertise and in-depth knowledge.

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:03.520
[Guest]: But if there are things that need to be done, which they feel that people will not oppose,

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.880
[Guest]: then those do get pushed through now the farm bills, okay.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:15.400
[Guest]: Now that was, I mean, we talk about the 91 reforms, but if you think about what were

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:21.880
[Guest]: the reforms, they were just industry and trade, you left agriculture out, you left the bulk

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.560
[Guest]: of the financial sector out, okay.

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:31.040
[Guest]: So when you start doing farm bills or the reforms to liberalize financial, sorry, agricultural

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:38.000
[Guest]: markets, which should have been done in 91, when you try to do them now, you saw the pushback.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.440
[Guest]: And I think that that will reduce the ability of any government to go further.

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:49.040
[Guest]: But it is not that nothing was tried and it would not have given immediate benefits.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:54.280
[Guest]: It would have liberalized agricultural markets in a manner that they should have been liberalized.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:59.800
[Guest]: So, you know, I think while people say that being a democracy means that you don't do

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:03.800
[Guest]: reform because you do populist things and you only look at the short term.

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:09.280
[Guest]: But I think that sometimes you do reforms because you are also answerable to the people

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.000
[Guest]: who you're going to go back to five years later.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.760
[Guest]: So you want to have something to show to the people.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.640
[Guest]: And if there is not much opposition, then you will do those.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.960
[Amit Varma]: No, I agree with that.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.040
[Amit Varma]: But I also disagree with the part of it like you spoke about, you know, the bureaucrats

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.480
[Amit Varma]: having a six month window and the politicians having a longer term view.

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:33.760
[Amit Varma]: But I think one of the things that gets in the way of reforms also is that politicians

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:38.560
[Amit Varma]: have relatively short election cycles in terms of the next election is not always just five

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.560
[Amit Varma]: years away.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.120
[Amit Varma]: There are elections happening somewhere or the other.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:45.040
[Amit Varma]: So if you're thinking at the national level, you're thinking, oh, Bengal elections is next

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.880
[Amit Varma]: or UP elections is next year.

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.840
[Amit Varma]: So you are kind of short termist.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:54.120
[Amit Varma]: And also your, you know, your bound is how people perceive what you are doing.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:59.040
[Amit Varma]: For example, a farm loan waiver, which almost became the rigor for every party to promise

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:04.000
[Amit Varma]: before every polls, a farm loan waiver, which is, you know, just a short term anesthetic

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.280
[Amit Varma]: will always have more takers than deeper structural solutions to whatever the problem may be.

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:15.760
[Amit Varma]: And also parties may kind of bind themselves into a corner with, say, the kind of nationalistic

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:20.880
[Amit Varma]: rhetoric that we see from this party sometimes where you talk of Atma Nirbharta and so on.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.280
[Amit Varma]: And those can also lead to bad economics.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.640
[Amit Varma]: In fact, good politics can often lead to bad economics.

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:29.080
[Amit Varma]: I've done an episode with Pooja Mehra on her book, The Lost Decade.

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:33.920
[Amit Varma]: And she pointed out that how, you know, some of the impetus behind why Modi abandoned reforms

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:37.040
[Amit Varma]: came after he was accused of being Sood Bhut ki Sarkar.

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:40.760
[Amit Varma]: And then he went all populist and, you know, reforms just stalled.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:45.720
[Amit Varma]: And then the disastrous demonetization also came about his perception of what would play

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.040
[Amit Varma]: well with the common people.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:51.640
[Amit Varma]: And maybe he was right because it did play well, even though it was, of course, a horrendous

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.760
[Amit Varma]: misstep.

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:56.480
[Amit Varma]: And what we see here, like I did an episode with our mutual friend Ajay Shah on the farm

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:01.160
[Amit Varma]: bills, where we kind of discussed about how the economic thrust of it is was great.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.960
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, the ruling party completely messed up the politics of it and didn't go

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.760
[Amit Varma]: about it the way that it should have.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:13.980
[Amit Varma]: And here also we see an example of where, you know, even like if you're trying to push

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:18.640
[Amit Varma]: through a measure which you know will be good in the long run, but in the short run might

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.400
[Amit Varma]: hurt people with vested interests or might hurt people in other ways.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.880
[Amit Varma]: They are, of course, going to fight back.

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:28.640
[Amit Varma]: And our politics is so polarized that then that can paralyze all movement, as seems to

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.920
[Amit Varma]: have happened in the case of the farm bills.

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:35.280
[Amit Varma]: So this relationship between politics and economics, how do you see it?

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.840
[Amit Varma]: Because it seems to me to be more an adversarial one than otherwise that good politics will

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.800
[Amit Varma]: generally make for bad economics and vice versa, because, of course, the incentive of

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.560
[Amit Varma]: the politician is to provide good governance.

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:51.200
[Amit Varma]: But number one, that governance is more something that he or she wants to be visible in the

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.320
[Amit Varma]: short term.

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:55.880
[Amit Varma]: And they are more keen on narratives rather than actual governance on the ground, as we've

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:56.880
[Amit Varma]: seen.

00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:05.800
[Guest]: So if I look back at the NDA 1 versus, say, the UPA 1 and 2, then what you're saying would

00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:10.720
[Guest]: imply that it doesn't matter, you know, there would have been no difference in the economic

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:15.960
[Guest]: policies or, you know, the previous Congress regimes after that, OK?

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:23.940
[Guest]: But when I actually look at what kind of reforms were done in NDA 1, they were much more than

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:30.360
[Guest]: what was done in the previous five years or the later five years, and bringing the private

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:37.080
[Guest]: sector in for infrastructure, because there were shortages of, you know, capital or liberalizing

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:42.200
[Guest]: capital account opening, allowing Indian companies to go abroad, which, you know, ultimately

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:46.720
[Guest]: they became bigger multinationals, brought in technology, many, many, many, many, there's

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.660
[Guest]: a large number of pension reforms, OK?

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:56.560
[Guest]: So going from a defined benefit to a defined contribution system and a list of many things.

00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:02.560
[Guest]: Now, many of those things were fundamentally a belief in markets, a belief in the private

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:08.400
[Guest]: sector, which we did not see in the Congress regimes.

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.880
[Guest]: So my sense is that it does matter.

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.240
[Guest]: Of course, all parties have to win elections.

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:19.360
[Guest]: Of course, all parties have their own, you know, machinery to take care of, individuals

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.140
[Guest]: to take care of, whatever, whatever, and so on.

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:30.280
[Guest]: But if there are opportunities, then we do see some not going towards markets.

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:36.720
[Guest]: So instead, when UPA comes back, when you see Manrega, you see a lot of welfare programs.

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:44.280
[Guest]: I mean, the state pretty much moves towards bankruptcy in that space, where before growing

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:51.600
[Guest]: rich, you have started doing a lot of redistribution, which then, of course, means that you have

00:55:51.600 --> 00:56:01.080
[Amit Varma]: less money for, you know, the roads that I was fighting about, when you were 19.

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:06.760
[Guest]: So I do think that it matters that the party, you know, has a certain thinking.

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:11.240
[Guest]: And so there are tactics and then there are things which, OK, if you get an opportunity,

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.240
[Guest]: let's do this.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:16.960
[Guest]: But it is a reform, and it is a reform that actually is a pro-market reform.

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:23.120
[Guest]: And I'm not denying that politicians or bureaucrats want to have power.

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.720
[Guest]: That's how the system till today.

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.240
[Guest]: It's not that we don't have state intervention today.

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.520
[Guest]: We have huge amounts of state intervention today.

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:34.160
[Guest]: But I'm just saying that maybe, you know, you're a little younger, so you're not seeing

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:37.400
[Guest]: this in these five-year chunks.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:44.720
[Guest]: But if you, sorry, if you look at NDA 1, and I look back, and I see there's quite a lot

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:48.920
[Guest]: that was done, which was pro-market reforms, which was economic reforms.

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:49.920
[Amit Varma]: That's true.

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:51.040
[Amit Varma]: So I have a couple of follow-up questions.

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:55.920
[Amit Varma]: And one of them actually, you know, you stated it as buttressing my point, but I think it

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.480
[Amit Varma]: actually in a way it might buttress my point, which is that you spoke about the reforms

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:00.480
[Amit Varma]: NDA 1 did.

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:04.000
[Amit Varma]: And I agree that I think, you know, some of the stuff they did was terrific.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.400
[Amit Varma]: But first of all, would you agree that the benefits of that actually showed up in the

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.400
[Amit Varma]: figures of the UPA?

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:14.320
[Amit Varma]: Like people will today say that, oh, in the 10 years of the UPA, we grew this much.

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.440
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, and I go nuts trying to say that, hey, this was because of the reforms

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.140
[Amit Varma]: of Vajpayee put into place.

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:23.760
[Amit Varma]: And then that would seem to state that if Vajpayee in retrospect was to, you know, sit

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:27.400
[Amit Varma]: there, he would say that, look, I can do these, but I might lose the elections, and then the

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.940
[Amit Varma]: next guy will take all the credit.

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:30.560
[Amit Varma]: So why should I think so far ahead?

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.680
[Amit Varma]: So that's kind of the first of my follow-ups.

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.080
[Guest]: Yeah, that's a very good question.

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:42.080
[Guest]: You see, so look at when NDA 1 lost, it was mainly attributed to the India Shining campaign,

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:47.200
[Guest]: that it was because, you know, the better off were doing better than they had been.

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.560
[Guest]: That is what should not have been said.

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:52.160
[Guest]: And that is what lost the elections.

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:54.720
[Guest]: And that the benefits, of course, showed up later.

00:57:54.720 --> 00:58:03.880
[Guest]: But I'm talking about a more deeper, shall I say, trait or character that you might do

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:07.360
[Guest]: or not do something because of winning or losing elections.

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:09.320
[Guest]: Okay, so that's one thing.

00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:15.400
[Guest]: But on the other hand, if you had no constraints, what would you do?

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:22.600
[Guest]: So if you had no constraints, would you be bringing in more welfare programs, large ones,

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:27.120
[Guest]: you know, and not ones that are interest subvention, where the government is putting this much

00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:29.720
[Guest]: money and, you know, getting leverage out of it?

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:34.480
[Guest]: Not those, but, you know, very large welfare programs, which the state has little capacity

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:39.880
[Guest]: to actually even handle, or would you be trying to do?

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:47.760
[Guest]: In fact, if I look back at the Atmanirbhar package, a lot of those things were, many

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:55.440
[Guest]: of those, including the farm bills, more prominently than anything else, the farm bills, were things

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:59.800
[Guest]: that should have been done earlier, which were pro-market reforms.

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:04.380
[Guest]: So what is it that you would do if you had been completely unconstrained?

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:11.880
[Guest]: And what I'm saying is simply this, that different political parties do have different characters,

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:16.720
[Guest]: do have different ideologies, would do different things if they were completely unconstrained.

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:24.200
[Guest]: Then, of course, the constraint of elections comes in when the NDA would not run another

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:28.920
[Guest]: India Shining program, wouldn't do many of those things, would back off when you say

00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.860
[Guest]: Sudbhut ki Sarkar.

00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:38.080
[Guest]: But if there was unconstrained maximization, then would they, you know, do things differently

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:42.080
[Guest]: from what the Congress would do?

00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:48.240
[Guest]: And I think that parties, at least in our two big parties, from what I feel looking

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:53.240
[Guest]: back is that they do differently, they do things, they pick different battles.

00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:59.520
[Guest]: And even though both are constrained, but, you know, to the extent, at least the PDMA

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.720
[Guest]: bill was tabled in Parliament.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720
[Amit Varma]: Maybe they rolled back.

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:08.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I'm not sure how much of this sort of fundamental thinking, as you seem to imply,

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:13.680
[Amit Varma]: we saw in Modi's first term, you know, where I think a lot of the, I mean, I wouldn't even

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.640
[Amit Varma]: call demonetization a misstep, it was just a massive blunder.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.120
[Amit Varma]: And the thinking behind it was completely wrong.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.920
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of what seems to have happened in those five years seems to be more the whims

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:28.280
[Amit Varma]: and fancies of certain individuals rather than any kind of directed thinking.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.960
[Amit Varma]: But leaving that aside, you know, the second question I had from what you sort of said

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.920
[Amit Varma]: earlier is again, a kind of a mindset question, which is, again, you know, talking about the

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.740
[Amit Varma]: growth versus welfare slash redistribution paradigm.

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And I don't even want to use the word welfare, because it implies, you know, welfare is a

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.480
[Amit Varma]: good word, you want people's welfare, but what we call welfare and economics doesn't

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.400
[Amit Varma]: always lead to good outcomes.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, it just speaks to good intentions.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:57.160
[Amit Varma]: And we, you know, make the error of often judging policies by intentions and not outcomes.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:01.840
[Amit Varma]: But the truth again, there is that again, I think, to me is sort of shows a difference

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.960
[Amit Varma]: between a positive some mindset and a zero some mindset where the redistribution mindset

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.480
[Amit Varma]: is that some people are rich, some are poor, we got to do something about the poor, how

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.480
[Amit Varma]: do we do it, we must redistribute.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.560
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, if overall, your country is poor, that's not going to achieve anything.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:18.640
[Amit Varma]: Whereas a growth mindset is that, you know, let's grow, everybody grows together, maybe

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.760
[Amit Varma]: inequality grows as well.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.840
[Amit Varma]: But both the rich and the poorer will get a little richer, at least you're solving the

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.840
[Amit Varma]: problem of poverty.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:30.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, one of the things that I find is that most people think inequality and poverty are

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.640
[Amit Varma]: exactly the same thing.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:35.040
[Amit Varma]: And if you're thinking in terms of growth, it doesn't seem to me that that is the case,

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.640
[Amit Varma]: it seems to me that, you know, for example, through the 90s, I would say that, you know,

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.800
[Amit Varma]: India lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, and inequality grew.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.320
[Amit Varma]: And I don't see that inequality as a bad thing, I think a fundamental problem is poverty.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.960
[Amit Varma]: And it's really wealthier nations, that having solved the problem of poverty, can then look

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.920
[Amit Varma]: at inequality and say that, okay, let's redistribute and all that, you know, even the Nordic states

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:02.040
[Amit Varma]: really became welfare states after they reached a certain level of wealth, and they could

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.800
[Amit Varma]: actually afford to redistribute.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.400
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not sure that we can really afford to redistribute too much.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.960
[Amit Varma]: So it just in terms of mindsets, have you seen this changing?

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:15.240
[Amit Varma]: Or would you say that certain parties like the Congress, for example, have this zero

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.920
[Amit Varma]: sum mindset.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:21.400
[Amit Varma]: And also, when you think about how it plays in politics, redistributive politics will

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:26.440
[Amit Varma]: always play better, because you seem compassionate, that will bestow all this largesse on the

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:30.460
[Amit Varma]: people, it seems compassionate, it plays better in political terms.

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:34.480
[Amit Varma]: But a lot of these pro poor policies, as we have seen through the decades, actually harms

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:35.680
[Amit Varma]: the poor.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:41.920
[Amit Varma]: And honestly, you know, even in the last few years, I haven't really seen, you know, I

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:46.560
[Amit Varma]: agreed that the Vajpayee government was refreshing in many ways, but I haven't seen that in the

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.560
[Amit Varma]: Modi government at all.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they've also been quite welfarist.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, that could be one reason they did well in the 2019 elections, because Modi actually

01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:00.800
[Amit Varma]: managed to implement some of the welfarism in the heartland and so on.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:08.720
[Guest]: My understanding of what Modi tried to do was to get more to the people out of the same

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.400
[Guest]: money that the Congress was spending.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:17.640
[Guest]: So if you beam it directly into their accounts, which is something that Montech used to be

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:23.720
[Guest]: wanting to do towards, you know, Montech and Nandan, they were making plans and those are

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:32.040
[Guest]: things that they were wanting to do, and in fact, UIDAI was set up as a structure that

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.240
[Guest]: would allow them to do that.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:41.520
[Guest]: NIPFP had done a study for the then Planning Commission, where we had worked out on how

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:48.680
[Guest]: ghost beneficiaries and duplicates would be reduced by Aadhaar and therefore all programs

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:54.040
[Guest]: of the government should actually be done through Aadhaar and there should be direct

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.040
[Guest]: benefit transfers.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.760
[Guest]: So, you know, when we study Latin American countries and we study direct benefit transfers,

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.640
[Guest]: cash transfers, instead of the kind of stuff that we used to have, then we used to say

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.800
[Guest]: that that is better economics, you're spending the money.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:15.700
[Guest]: Now that way Modi got more bang for the buck, because when something goes straight into

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:22.160
[Guest]: a Jandhan account, Aadhaar-linked Jandhan account, instead of, you know, it being leaked,

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.160
[Guest]: what did Rajiv Gandhi do?

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.760
[Amit Varma]: I think Rajiv Gandhi said that something like 85% of, there's 85% leakage.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.600
[Amit Varma]: So if you give a hundred rupees to a guy, by the time it reaches him, there's 15 rupees

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.600
[Guest]: left.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:40.800
[Guest]: So, when you are in a system where there are a lot of middlemen and the middlemen would,

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.640
[Guest]: I guess, not something I know, but I guess over the years have allegiance to the Congress

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.080
[Guest]: because, you know, that's the old elite, the old political elite.

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.640
[Guest]: And now there's no point in your feeding those middlemen, right?

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.360
[Guest]: Because they're not yours.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:02.240
[Guest]: And secondly, you will get more bang for the buck, you know, when the hundred rupees reaches

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:09.600
[Guest]: your voter directly, in a manner which, I mean, all Latin American economists and many

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:15.320
[Guest]: of us who, till it started happening here, were lauding cash transfers, were saying that

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.360
[Guest]: that's the right thing to do.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:26.240
[Guest]: Then it is an approach that, just let's assume for a moment, you know, put the economic reforms,

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.440
[Guest]: pro-market economic reforms, as we understand it, to one side for the moment.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:37.600
[Guest]: Let's just try to assume that it was a UPA-3, okay, which went with, I'm not saying that

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:44.640
[Guest]: Modi was UPA-3, so please, you know, I'm not, I'm only saying that, let's just assume that

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:52.040
[Guest]: we take it as a continuation of the plans that were made by Montek and Nandan for the

01:05:52.040 --> 01:06:00.040
[Guest]: Planning Commission, which was the cost-benefit analysis study that I did, okay, at an IPFP

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:05.200
[Guest]: for the Planning Commission, that this is what should be done and that this is how you'll

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:12.360
[Guest]: reduce the leakages, both for ghost beneficiaries and for duplicates, and you will reduce leakages

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:17.800
[Guest]: that go to the middlemen, and then let's say they had implemented that.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:21.820
[Guest]: I think all of us would have been saying that's very good.

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:27.880
[Guest]: What happened, in my opinion, was that we had very high expectations of NDA-1 sort of

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:35.660
[Guest]: reforms from NDA-2, and instead of, and maybe in the meantime, the party had understood

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:42.080
[Guest]: that doing the NDA-1 reforms doesn't get them votes, so maybe they could slip in a reform

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:47.600
[Guest]: here and there because they're not opposed to those reforms, but they could not be showing

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.660
[Guest]: them as their big, that was not, you know, the big thing that they did.

01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:57.960
[Guest]: In fact, if the big thing that they do is to stop leakages and directly reach people,

01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:04.720
[Guest]: then you know, I think it's a very, very clever, very, very smart, very smart political move,

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:09.640
[Guest]: and I think that's perhaps a part of what won the 2019 election.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:13.200
[Amit Varma]: So to sort of paraphrase what you're saying, you're saying that yeah, okay, there's a trade-off

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:18.000
[Amit Varma]: between growth and redistribution, we should have pro-growth policies, but given the political

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.520
[Amit Varma]: reality that those are much harder to do, and much harder to pull off given political

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:27.920
[Amit Varma]: constraints, maybe it makes sense that if you have to do a certain amount of redistribution,

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:31.360
[Amit Varma]: do the damn thing well, just be much more efficient.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.520
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, something like this, which is cutting off leakage from, you know, leakage

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:39.280
[Amit Varma]: of 85%, as it were, maybe more, maybe less in specific instances, is something that is

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:45.320
[Amit Varma]: going to pay you kind of great political dividends, so why not do that, and maybe other reforms

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:52.960
[Guest]: can happen, you know, economically, plus economically, economically, as I was repeating that, when

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:59.960
[Guest]: you study the impact of leakages on the FISC, and you look at whether, you know, you want

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:06.040
[Guest]: to keep on letting that money slip through without having an impact on poverty, then

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.840
[Guest]: it makes economic sense to do direct cash transfers.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:16.000
[Guest]: And if you spend the first two years doing this, whatever, Jam, Aadhaar, Trinity, whatever

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.360
[Guest]: they call it, Jandhan Aadhaar Mobile, right, Jam, yeah, Jandhan Aadhaar Mobile, so if you

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:26.880
[Guest]: spend time building the whole infrastructure, so I was in the ministry at that time, I was

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:33.680
[Guest]: in the Ministry of Finance, you know, so as far as I was concerned, they did all the macroeconomic

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.440
[Guest]: stabilization things with fiscal policy and inflation targeting, and some limited reforms

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:47.280
[Guest]: that I had been talking about, but on the other hand, this was a big focus of the government,

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:51.280
[Guest]: that we just get the money directly to people.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:56.160
[Guest]: That's not bad economic policy, that if you were doing redistribution badly, and you start

01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:02.560
[Guest]: doing it properly, that let's say that's your focus, not your focus is not to do agricultural

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:10.520
[Guest]: bills on the first day, you did that in India too, I think that was a smart thing to do.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:16.040
[Guest]: I think that makes sense, not just politically, not just politically, it saves your fiscal

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.040
[Guest]: lot of money.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:21.920
[Guest]: Otherwise, you know, think of the corruption, the leakages, the rent-seeking, what we have,

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.880
[Guest]: we can just spend all, everything possible.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.600
[Amit Varma]: So you were like a principal economic advisor in 2014 and 2015.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.920
[Amit Varma]: Now it's interesting that, you know, if I remember correctly, at that time, you sided

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.080
[Amit Varma]: with Raghuram Rajan, when he spoke about inflation targeting and all that, and Piyush Goyal was

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.720
[Amit Varma]: against it and so on.

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:44.520
[Amit Varma]: So what's that experience like, like one of the things that, you know, Pooja Mehra wrote

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:48.720
[Amit Varma]: about in her book, The Lost Decade was that there was a certain continuity that when Arun

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:53.600
[Amit Varma]: Jaitley came in as FM, he carried forward some of the thinking of the later months of

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.720
[Amit Varma]: Chidambaram.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.000
[Amit Varma]: At that time, there was some unity there, and then everything kind of fell apart as

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
[Amit Varma]: it went along.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.960
[Amit Varma]: And of course, you know, I know that there will, of course, be things that you cannot

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.920
[Amit Varma]: speak about or, you know, can't reveal.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.640
[Amit Varma]: But apart from that, what was that experience like of working within the government?

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.560
[Amit Varma]: Was there a sense that there is one direction that we are going in?

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.840
[Amit Varma]: Were you taken seriously?

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you did one of the economic surveys, yeah?

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.920
[Guest]: Yeah, very much, certainly on inflation targeting.

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:28.280
[Guest]: I mean, this was work that I had done when I was part of the research team of FSLRC,

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.000
[Guest]: the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.280
[Guest]: This was work where I had a chapter in the book that was released by Prime Minister Modi

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.800
[Guest]: when he was just elected, I mean, within the first few days.

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:44.400
[Guest]: And this was something that I'd been working on for quite a while.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:50.640
[Guest]: And then when it came to, you know, working on first the Monetary Policy Framework Agreement,

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.920
[Guest]: that was done in 2015.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:59.160
[Guest]: And finance secretary knew, you know, the DEA secretary was Rajiv Mehrishi, who first

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:05.400
[Guest]: it was Mr. Mayaram, who I worked with, and he was also continuing that agenda forward.

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:14.960
[Guest]: And then Mr. Mehrishi came and he put, you know, the accelerator was pressed very hard.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.360
[Guest]: And a lot of this work got done at that time.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:25.640
[Guest]: So by March 2016, the inflation targeting, the bill was actually, the RBI Act was amended

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:29.240
[Guest]: and the objective of monetary policy was changed.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:35.160
[Guest]: So this was a period that was, I should say, exhilarating.

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:39.480
[Amit Varma]: You say this was a period which was exhilarating, why did the period end?

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:47.920
[Guest]: Well, I moved back to NIPFP and Mr. Mehrishi moved on, he became the Home Secretary.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.120
[Guest]: And then I think the way things went, it was also Arvind then joined as CEA.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.800
[Guest]: So earlier he was not Chief Economic Advisor.

01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:00.480
[Guest]: And then they started, Arvind was focusing on infrastructure, public sector, public investment

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.400
[Guest]: in infrastructure.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:11.400
[Guest]: There was focus on doing NIIF funds for investment, basically, the focus shifted to how can we

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:16.640
[Guest]: increase public investment away from, you know, when you do financial sector reforms,

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:23.360
[Guest]: the returns come a decade later.

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:29.400
[Guest]: So I think part of what happened was that, yes, we've done some of this and this will

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:35.480
[Guest]: take years to play out, but now we better get back to the task on hand, which is try

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.240
[Guest]: to push investment.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:39.080
[Guest]: So the focus shifted a bit.

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.080
[Amit Varma]: Wonderful.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.840
[Amit Varma]: So what we'll do now is we'll take a quick commercial break.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:45.760
[Amit Varma]: And when we come back, we'll talk more about the economy as it is now and how it has been

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.240
[Amit Varma]: in the last few years and how it has been post COVID and how it's all going to play

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.240
[Amit Varma]: out.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.360
[Amit Varma]: But before that, a quick commercial break.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.120
[Amit Varma]: In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog, India Uncut,

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:06.920
[Amit Varma]: which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:12.000
[Amit Varma]: I love the freedom the form gave me, and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.920
[Amit Varma]: I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.120
[Amit Varma]: because I wrote about many different things.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.200
[Amit Varma]: Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons, and now it is time to revive it.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.960
[Amit Varma]: Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:33.040
[Amit Varma]: I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com, where I will write

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.600
[Amit Varma]: regularly about whatever catches my fancy.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.200
[Amit Varma]: I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else.

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:58.240
[Amit Varma]: The India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.240
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.960
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:06.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Ela Patnaik about the Indian economy as it is today.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.760
[Amit Varma]: But I'll continue with kind of general questions for a while because this is sort of a question

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.120
[Amit Varma]: that has a bearing on everything.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.120
[Amit Varma]: And it's a question about data.

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.320
[Amit Varma]: Like as an economist, you need raw material to work with.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:21.880
[Amit Varma]: And in India, famously, the quality of data is incredibly iffy.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.880
[Amit Varma]: So much of India is actually in the informal sector, for example, like, I remember sort

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:30.560
[Amit Varma]: of interrogating Arvind Subramaniam on this when he was on my show about, you know, the

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.920
[Amit Varma]: impact of demonetization.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.360
[Amit Varma]: And my point is that, you know, so much of the data is just not there, because it would

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.520
[Amit Varma]: have hurt the informal sector the most.

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:42.160
[Amit Varma]: And even a lot of the data which is there, like the GDP, for example, which is like a

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:45.400
[Amit Varma]: sort of a marker in the public eyes for how the economy is doing.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.840
[Amit Varma]: But number one, the methodology keeps changing and is somewhat opaque.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.360
[Amit Varma]: And number two, any metric that exists can be gamed.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.440
[Amit Varma]: I had done an episode with Rajeshwari Sengupta on the GDP as well.

01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:01.400
[Amit Varma]: And it's historically been a metric that can be gamed, has been gamed.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:06.080
[Amit Varma]: One doesn't know how much it truly reflects either progress or the opposite of it.

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.520
[Amit Varma]: So what's your approach towards data in the sense that, you know, since the mid 90s, you

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:14.480
[Amit Varma]: had to work in this environment where you know your data is iffy.

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.520
[Amit Varma]: So do you figure out proxy ways of getting data?

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.360
[Amit Varma]: Do you do different kinds of jugaad for your analysis?

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.600
[Amit Varma]: What's your approach towards that?

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.080
[Guest]: And how much of a hindrance is it?

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:30.520
[Guest]: So I started working on business cycles, which mean trying to track the economy in 96.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:35.400
[Guest]: You know, that was one of my first projects and it was a project for the RBI at NCAR,

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:40.240
[Guest]: where we were trying to look at how can we measure the economy as it is today?

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.320
[Guest]: How can we measure the economy looking forward as well?

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:47.240
[Guest]: And GDP is not even adequate for that.

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:51.600
[Guest]: So one issue that you're talking about is the quality of the GDP data, but the second

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.120
[Guest]: is that it comes later.

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:58.440
[Guest]: So you know what happened if you know a bit about what happened earlier, but you don't

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.040
[Guest]: know what is happening now.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:08.040
[Guest]: So what we did was to, well, we had 105 monthly series that were available.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:16.240
[Guest]: So you know, you think about price series, imports, exports, money supply, IIP, then

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:21.760
[Guest]: now we've added more lately, I continue to, you know, do the same thing, because tracking

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.040
[Guest]: the economy is something that's of deep interest to me.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:29.580
[Guest]: So now we've added data from sales and profits of firms.

01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:34.680
[Guest]: So there's a prowess database where they put together firm performance, so annual reports

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.560
[Guest]: of firms, so we track that.

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:42.920
[Guest]: So we don't just look at only GDP, we look at a number of indicators.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:49.320
[Guest]: There is actually a well-established literature on this, where starting from Mitchell and

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:57.800
[Guest]: Burns at NBER in the US in the 40s, there is an attempt by economists to catch what

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:02.040
[Guest]: is happening today, to catch it not just through GDP, but to understand it through a number

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.360
[Guest]: of other indicators.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:10.160
[Guest]: We have also been trying to build a coincident indicator series and a leading indicator series

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.080
[Guest]: to see how they behave.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:17.840
[Guest]: Now, very often, you know, we see things a little before they happen, because we are

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.360
[Guest]: looking at these various indicators.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:25.560
[Guest]: Of course, we are constrained by not being able to see everything, because, you know,

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.120
[Guest]: we don't capture the informal sector.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.960
[Guest]: But you know, we don't capture the informal sector from the production side.

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:38.200
[Guest]: But if you think about it, then people in the informal sector also live, consume, buy

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.200
[Guest]: things.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:44.560
[Guest]: So, you know, GDP is measured not in just one way, but in three different ways.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.520
[Guest]: And we do capture some of it.

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:52.160
[Amit Varma]: Can you give me any example that comes to mind of when looking at data in all these

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:57.180
[Amit Varma]: very granular, unconventional, nuanced ways might have given you insight about something

01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:00.800
[Amit Varma]: that is happening or something that is going to happen, which you would otherwise have

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.800
[Amit Varma]: missed?

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.280
[Amit Varma]: Like, were there any aha moments in all these years of studying the data, which kind of

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.240
[Amit Varma]: made you see something a little better?

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:15.320
[Guest]: Well, I think it's more a question of timeliness, that one is able to see that, you know, if

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.320
[Guest]: it's imports.

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:20.160
[Guest]: First of all, it's not very unconventional, by the way, as I said, it's been done since

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.160
[Guest]: the 1940s.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:26.200
[Guest]: But in India, I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:32.800
[Guest]: So you know, you start looking at import data, we even make an index of our leading indicators,

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.040
[Guest]: some others also do.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.740
[Guest]: But if you look at import data, it reflects what is coming later.

01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:40.720
[Guest]: So you kind of catch on a little sooner.

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:48.560
[Guest]: So it's a question of time, not so much of being, you know, knowing more or less about

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.560
[Guest]: the economy.

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:54.480
[Guest]: So you get to know a little bit sooner when you track other series, which are more frequent.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.200
[Guest]: Like I was looking at the export data.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:06.000
[Guest]: So weekly in the first week of May, this May, exports are showing an increase of 80% over

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.940
[Guest]: the last year, when last year, there was a lockdown, of course.

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:10.840
[Guest]: So there's a base effect as well.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:14.840
[Guest]: But at least it's showing 80%, it's showing a positive high growth, because the world

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.680
[Guest]: economy has started picking up.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:22.280
[Guest]: So you know, then you it helps you understand better of where you're going, and you just

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.640
[Guest]: get a bit of an early start.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.960
[Amit Varma]: So the way I want to talk about the economy is maybe the last few years and then come

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:28.960
[Amit Varma]: to COVID.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:34.900
[Amit Varma]: But an immediate question, which is kind of sparked by the beginning of this pandemic,

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:39.480
[Amit Varma]: because I just want to understand how an economist thinks about specific problems.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:43.760
[Amit Varma]: So now let's say that in March last year, if an economist working with government and

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:48.320
[Amit Varma]: I'm specifying working with government in this hypothetical instance, because I don't

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:52.920
[Amit Varma]: just want to think of how economists sitting on the outside whose views may have no bearing

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.440
[Amit Varma]: on the world, how they think, but if you're working with government, if you're advising

01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:02.800
[Amit Varma]: government, then how would one begin to calibrate a policy move, like a lockdown, like you've

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:06.600
[Amit Varma]: of course, characterized it as lives versus livelihoods, which of course it is.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.880
[Amit Varma]: And you could also say in a sense as lives versus lives, because, you know, in the long

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.920
[Amit Varma]: run, there will be the impact of a lockdown.

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:17.880
[Amit Varma]: Now, this kind of policy measure seems to me to really be a terrible Hobson's choice

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:23.800
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that whatever you do, the bad effects of it are seen, and the good effects

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:24.880
[Amit Varma]: are unseen.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:29.800
[Amit Varma]: So you you know, if you call a lockdown, you will, for example, see the impact on migrant

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:34.120
[Amit Varma]: labour on the economy, you'll see all of that what you will not see is the opportunity costs

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.680
[Amit Varma]: the lives that you've saved.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:36.680
[Amit Varma]: And vice versa.

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:39.800
[Amit Varma]: If you don't call a lockdown, you'll see the lives of people who die.

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:43.000
[Amit Varma]: But what you won't see is that the economy is still functioning.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:48.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, whenever one makes a decision like this, and unfortunately, with the Indian state,

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:52.400
[Amit Varma]: because of state capacity, there are only these very blunt tools, you either do a lockdown

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:53.560
[Amit Varma]: or you don't.

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:57.640
[Amit Varma]: And you know, given that that is the case, how would an economist think about this?

01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:02.200
[Amit Varma]: Like what is the data you'd look at, what would you do to establish some kind of understanding

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.760
[Amit Varma]: of what the probabilities might be?

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:08.520
[Amit Varma]: And of course, the political calculus and all that is something completely separate.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:12.720
[Amit Varma]: But just to sort of understand how an economist thinks, what are the tools you're bringing

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:13.720
[Amit Varma]: into play here?

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.520
[Amit Varma]: How would you do it?

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:19.800
[Guest]: I would think about what is the kind of shock that this is.

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:24.040
[Guest]: So in the first lockdown, it was a supply side shock.

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:29.600
[Guest]: Because we said, okay, shut down, and companies had to shut down.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.400
[Guest]: It wasn't so much a demand side shock.

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:34.960
[Guest]: I mean, of course, to some extent, you would call it a demand side shock, but it was a

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:39.080
[Guest]: temporary demand side shock, that is people could not go to the shops.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:42.200
[Guest]: And so they were not buying products.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:46.080
[Guest]: But suppose it had lasted, let's just because there's so much uncertainty that one doesn't

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:49.040
[Guest]: know whether it was going, how long it was going to last.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:53.800
[Guest]: But suppose it had last, the lockdown and the pandemic had lasted one month.

01:21:53.800 --> 01:22:01.040
[Guest]: And let's say that my understanding from not economics, but epidemiology and you know,

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:05.360
[Guest]: whatever, whatever the doctors were telling us was that it was going to last for one month.

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.920
[Guest]: Let's just assume.

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:15.120
[Guest]: Then I would try to understand, okay, if I, one month later, I allow people to get back

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:20.320
[Guest]: to work, then it will almost be, you know, the demand would not be hit.

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.280
[Guest]: It would mainly be the supply got affected.

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:27.760
[Guest]: Yes, there would be some people whose balance sheets would hurt, but, you know, we can go

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.760
[Guest]: forward.

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:35.360
[Guest]: Now, if I turn to today, and suppose, so again, data is very limited.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.400
[Guest]: One would look at consumer sentiment.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:41.080
[Guest]: One looks at imports in terms of activity, one looks at exports.

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:47.320
[Guest]: So, you know, looking at what is happening here, household expenditure, household, you

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:52.080
[Guest]: know, unemployment data that one gets, Mandrega data, because Mandrega is a good indicator

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:56.640
[Guest]: of people having gone back to villages and what they are doing now.

01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:01.560
[Guest]: Putting all of this together, one would try to understand, has there been a year long

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:04.920
[Guest]: deep impact on people's incomes?

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:13.320
[Guest]: And if so, then are we going to see a deeper demand effect than we saw in the first case?

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:17.960
[Guest]: And that would help me to, and suppose, of course, somebody said that this would continue

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.960
[Guest]: for a year, okay?

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:23.680
[Guest]: Then one would try to think of what are the policies?

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:24.680
[Guest]: These are not easy choices.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:29.640
[Guest]: As you very, very correctly said, whatever happens, you're going to be blamed for doing

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:30.640
[Guest]: the wrong thing.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:31.640
[Guest]: Okay.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:36.240
[Guest]: But, you know, then one would try to understand, okay, what does one require to give a demand

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.240
[Guest]: stimulus?

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:41.360
[Guest]: Initially, if you notice, I mean, somebody must have figured this out.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:45.560
[Guest]: But there wasn't much of a demand stimulus given, because it was a supply side issue.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:50.200
[Guest]: So when the package came, it had, you know, food and so on.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.260
[Guest]: But other than that, it was reforms.

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:58.280
[Guest]: In some other countries, they continue to, they gave wages.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:01.740
[Guest]: So I guess, you know, these are the tools I would use.

01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:03.680
[Amit Varma]: This is how I would think about it.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:07.760
[Amit Varma]: And how does one, like, for example, another policy debate that I've seen playing out in

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.440
[Amit Varma]: the United States, for example, is that when do we open schools?

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.120
[Amit Varma]: How long do we shut schools?

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:19.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, Anup Malani in an episode with Milan Vaishnav on his podcast, the Grand Tamasha,

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:22.600
[Amit Varma]: Milan's podcast, that is, had made the point that, you know, that if you shut schools for

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:27.080
[Amit Varma]: a year, for example, in a hypothetic situation, the loss to the economy in the future is also

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.720
[Amit Varma]: immense because human capital is getting affected.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:34.000
[Amit Varma]: And you simply don't know that just mentally how the kids will be and how everything will

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
[Amit Varma]: proceed.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
[Amit Varma]: There are so many kinds of imponderables.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.280
[Amit Varma]: And at some level, when it comes to things like this, it seems to me that, you know,

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:43.680
[Amit Varma]: the cost goes somewhere, the benefits go somewhere else.

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.520
[Amit Varma]: How can you even do a cost to benefit analysis?

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:49.180
[Amit Varma]: In many ways, it seems like apples and oranges.

01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:54.280
[Amit Varma]: And the very act of attempting to do an analysis would also come down to say putting a price

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.320
[Amit Varma]: on a life.

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:59.280
[Amit Varma]: Do economists who often get a rap for being heartless, do they do that?

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.760
[Amit Varma]: Do they like implicitly are you having to put a price on lives?

01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:07.900
[Amit Varma]: Like, if I was to tell you that the lockdown will save 100 lives but cost so many 100 crores,

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:09.760
[Amit Varma]: you would probably say, let's not have a lockdown.

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:13.940
[Amit Varma]: But if I tell you it will save 100,000 lives, and you know, the calculus changes.

01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:18.080
[Amit Varma]: How does one, you know, come to grips with all of this?

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:22.760
[Guest]: I'm not sure that economists do this very differently from the rest of us.

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:26.200
[Guest]: And if they do, if they do, they're pretending to do it.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:29.120
[Guest]: Because nobody can put a cost to a life.

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:33.440
[Guest]: You might have your measures, you might develop them because you want to be able to pay somebody

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.560
[Guest]: in case of an accident.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.900
[Guest]: But you know, that's a bit of a practical thing.

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:45.500
[Guest]: But if you do it prior to the event, then I don't think anybody, economist or not has

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:53.580
[Guest]: the courage to say, these young girls, daughters of so and so can go die.

01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:54.880
[Guest]: Nobody has the courage to do that.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.300
[Guest]: And nobody, we don't think like that, we can't think like that.

01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:04.120
[Guest]: So I'm not sure that, you know, this is something that anybody actually does.

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:08.160
[Guest]: Even though yes, you know, there might be academic papers and debates saying that, you

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:12.480
[Guest]: know, it's okay to lose 1000 lives and, you know, not spend money.

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:17.720
[Guest]: But you know, at least I've always been saying, initially spend what you have to on the RTPCR

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:18.720
[Guest]: test.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:23.640
[Guest]: Let it be 1% of GDP and whoever spends it, whether it's state governments, central governments,

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.600
[Guest]: companies, schools, institutions, whoever spends it.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.320
[Guest]: And today that spend what you need to on vaccination, you know, bring all the energy you have, bring

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.320
[Guest]: all the money you have.

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:38.960
[Guest]: I mean, you save a life, you can always earn more later, do something, not do something,

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:43.960
[Guest]: live frugally, whatever happens, but you know, once you've lost a life, it doesn't come back.

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:48.400
[Guest]: And you know, this is a pandemic, it's a once in, I don't know, we've never been in this

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:51.200
[Guest]: situation before of making these choices.

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:58.700
[Guest]: And I don't think anybody has the tools or is in a place to actually make these choices.

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:04.720
[Guest]: This thing, I think, comes down to the question of when you decide whether to do a national

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:11.040
[Guest]: lockdown or not to do a national lockdown, okay, that's what this will come down to.

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:16.960
[Guest]: Then the question to ask would not be whether you were making the decision between saving

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:22.720
[Guest]: lives and not saving lives, but it would really be that could a local lockdown save lives

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:28.760
[Guest]: as well, compared to a national lockdown, because a national lockdown absolutely does

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.800
[Guest]: lead to a lot of misery and loss of livelihoods.

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:34.000
[Guest]: But does it actually save more lives?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.240
[Guest]: Does it, you know, so if somebody's ill in some other state, but like in Delhi, if we

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:43.320
[Guest]: have started recovering and positivity rate has gone down, and the number of infections

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:48.720
[Guest]: has gone down, then maybe a week or two down the line, if we decide to open up, even if

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.920
[Guest]: cases somewhere else are rising, then is it not more rational to do so?

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:54.600
[Amit Varma]: I think that's the choice.

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:59.360
[Amit Varma]: Okay, so you know, when you said at the start of your answer that you think economists are

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:02.920
[Amit Varma]: just the same as normal people, what you went on to say was that none of us will want to

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.500
[Amit Varma]: place a value on a life.

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:06.120
[Amit Varma]: But I thought you meant the opposite.

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:09.840
[Amit Varma]: So I was a little surprised because I think implicitly everyone is placing a value on

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:14.080
[Amit Varma]: our life, like even my own, for example, like every time I cross the road, I know there

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.000
[Amit Varma]: is a very, very small probability that, you know, something will run me over.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.640
[Amit Varma]: But I choose to make that choice, because the sort of utility of crossing the road is

01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:25.400
[Amit Varma]: worth more to me than whatever that very tiny percentage is.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.920
[Amit Varma]: And this, of course, you know, every time I go out on a drive, for example, I'm making

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:33.360
[Amit Varma]: the same kind of calculus, in a sense, I'm placing a certain value on my life.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:37.840
[Amit Varma]: And I think economists would also implicitly at least have to do that, even if they can't

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.040
[Amit Varma]: put a number to it, because it is so icky.

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:43.640
[Amit Varma]: And as human beings, we want to think every life is priceless.

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:48.040
[Amit Varma]: But you know, in a thought experiment where a lockdown is going to cost, say, a thousand

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:52.200
[Amit Varma]: crores, but is going to save just one life, you know, and you would say that the loss

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:55.840
[Amit Varma]: of that thousand crores, the economy will actually cost many more lives somewhere down

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:56.840
[Amit Varma]: the line.

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.160
[Amit Varma]: And you don't actually know that.

01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:01.280
[Amit Varma]: So somewhere there is a number at which you say this is a threshold we have to call a

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.280
[Amit Varma]: lockdown now.

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, absolutely.

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:08.720
[Guest]: But, you know, when it comes to things like giving indemnity, if the state has to say

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:14.560
[Guest]: that, OK, if something goes wrong, we'll pay for it, while if, you know, people don't get

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:19.760
[Guest]: the vaccine, oh, I will not give the vaccine, but I'll save, you know, whatever, ten thousand

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:20.760
[Guest]: crores.

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:25.040
[Guest]: OK, but, you know, ten crore people will die.

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:29.800
[Guest]: If that's the kind of choice, then it's an open, nobody, yeah, yeah.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:34.400
[Guest]: So, you know, of course, I mean, I'm just saying that as economists, one is not doing

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:35.400
[Guest]: anything different.

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:39.240
[Guest]: I mean, you are you are placing a value on your life.

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:40.240
[Guest]: Ask your mom.

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:44.040
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I in this present circumstance, I mean, frankly, I think we're both in agreement

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:47.880
[Amit Varma]: that we should just spend whatever to, you know, save lives because, you know, you'll

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:51.060
[Amit Varma]: spend a thousand crores, but in the long run save way more.

01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:54.640
[Amit Varma]: And also indemnity, I guess you're referring to the whole Pfizer thing.

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:57.560
[Amit Varma]: And I guess you agree with me that we should just give indemnity.

01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:01.200
[Amit Varma]: Every other country has given them indemnity, just bring them in, just get that, make the

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.760
[Amit Varma]: damn vaccine available.

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:08.960
[Guest]: Just feel that every day we are losing people and, you know, they won't come back.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:13.480
[Guest]: Whereas if we put some money down, then we can always earn more money or even if we don't

01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:14.480
[Amit Varma]: earn more money.

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:15.480
[Amit Varma]: It's fine.

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:16.480
[Guest]: I mean, we can live a bit more frugally.

01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:17.480
[Guest]: Yeah, it's fine.

01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.480
[Guest]: It's fine.

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:21.440
[Guest]: So I think this should be at the top of the agenda.

01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:22.440
[Amit Varma]: It's just nuts.

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:24.760
[Amit Varma]: But I mean, that's another discussion.

01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.320
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of get back to the economy now.

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:30.880
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of zoom in and talk about, say, the trajectory of the last few years.

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.160
[Amit Varma]: I'd done an episode with Pooja Mehra on her book, The Lost Decade, where the trajectory

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:39.560
[Amit Varma]: that she shaped for me was that, look, our economy suddenly started doing much worse

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:43.600
[Amit Varma]: at around the time Pranab Mukherjee took over as finance minister because there were the

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.080
[Amit Varma]: terrorist attacks in Bombay.

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:48.680
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, Shivraj Patil was Home Minister, did a lousy job.

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:52.840
[Amit Varma]: They shifted Chidambaram there, therefore Pranab took over finance, made a complete

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:58.240
[Amit Varma]: mess of it, started going downhill with a credit crisis, kind of got exacerbated.

01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:04.160
[Amit Varma]: And there was a whole atmosphere of retrospective taxation and what that did for the investment

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.160
[Amit Varma]: mood.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:09.000
[Amit Varma]: There was just a bunch of things which listeners can go listen to that episode and all that.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.520
[Amit Varma]: And then when Modi came, they were, you know, Chidambaram took over after Pranab was elevated

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.440
[Amit Varma]: to the presidency for a while.

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.800
[Amit Varma]: But he was there for too short a time.

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:19.680
[Amit Varma]: And then Modi took over.

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:23.920
[Amit Varma]: And then politics came in the way the moment the suit boot ki sarkar jibes came, reforms

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:30.200
[Amit Varma]: went out of the window and demon happened, the incredibly botched GST happened and so

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:31.200
[Amit Varma]: on.

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:32.200
[Amit Varma]: And it's just been downhill.

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:35.760
[Amit Varma]: And then COVID hit and everything's just been downhill for the last 10 years.

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.320
[Amit Varma]: Would you broadly agree with this narrative?

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:39.860
[Amit Varma]: And you've been much, much closer to the action.

01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:41.680
[Amit Varma]: So what is your sense of it?

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:45.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of nuance you can add to this.

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:52.240
[Guest]: So I think 2011 or so is the period when I started seeing investment going down, private

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:53.240
[Guest]: investment.

01:31:53.240 --> 01:32:00.520
[Guest]: I mean, really what has taken the economy up and down is cycles in private investment.

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:04.720
[Guest]: So 2011 is the period when it starts going down.

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:09.020
[Guest]: And I agree with most of what Pooja has said and what you're telling me.

01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:14.720
[Guest]: But just to add to the story, in my opinion, the story began earlier.

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:20.200
[Guest]: The story began from 2004 to 2007.

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.560
[Guest]: And why do I say that?

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:25.600
[Guest]: Because that was the time when there was a lot of capital coming in.

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:30.400
[Guest]: RBI was buying up dollars, pushing liquidity into the system.

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.720
[Guest]: You know, we all look at it from our perspective.

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:37.080
[Guest]: So I look at it from the perspective of monetary policy.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:43.760
[Guest]: And there was a time when credit was growing at about, in 2007, at about 40% per annum,

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:46.440
[Guest]: a very high growth of credit.

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:53.960
[Guest]: And banks were lending merrily, not being as prudent as they might have been if you

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:59.800
[Guest]: didn't have this huge liquidity sloshing around in the system.

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:03.760
[Guest]: And then came the 2007-2008 Lehman episode.

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:09.600
[Guest]: In fact, things start going bad even towards the end, right at the end of 2007.

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:12.880
[Guest]: So but of course, Lehman was the turning point.

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:20.000
[Guest]: And after that, you had a sudden contraction in the economy and a decline in demand.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:27.760
[Guest]: A lot of the loans that had been given by the banking system were already in trouble.

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:33.240
[Guest]: Most infrastructure companies, there had been a lot of emphasis on infrastructure.

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:40.640
[Guest]: And you know, really, banks are not well suited to lend to infrastructure companies, because

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.180
[Guest]: there is a maturity mismatch.

01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:49.000
[Guest]: The capacity of banks to assess those loans, to hold on to those loans for 30 years, to

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.960
[Guest]: resist political influence, and not to give loans, especially public sector banks, you

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:59.680
[Guest]: know, and with a regulator who would pretty much was turning a blind eye to the loans

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:01.840
[Guest]: that were being given.

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:07.520
[Guest]: So I can say that, you know, I've done some rough analysis, but roughly a third of the

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:14.200
[Guest]: loans went bad, because just bad business decisions, people had been overoptimistic.

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:18.640
[Guest]: And a third, of course, were frauds and cheats who ran away.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:25.280
[Guest]: And the others got into trouble because of what used to be famously called then policy

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:31.520
[Guest]: paralysis, that you stepped out, you thought you'd get an environment clearance, you know,

01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:36.520
[Guest]: and somehow in the system, environment clearances were supposed to be gotten by the private

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.740
[Guest]: contractor who was doing the project.

01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:42.200
[Guest]: It wasn't that the government, within the government got those clearances, they thought,

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:44.280
[Guest]: oh, he let him bribe his way through.

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:48.400
[Guest]: So a third, roughly a third went bad because of those.

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:55.640
[Guest]: Now, this was a situation in say, 2010-11, when on top of this, you add retrospective

01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:01.640
[Guest]: taxes, and a badly managed Ministry of Finance.

01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:07.920
[Guest]: I was doing this NIPFPDA program that we've been doing, and it's a badly managed Ministry

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.320
[Guest]: of Finance under Pranab Mukherjee, honestly.

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:19.320
[Guest]: So put that all together, and you see that from 2011 onwards, investment starts declining.

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:23.560
[Guest]: There's a little bit of a blip in 2015.

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:29.600
[Guest]: So I expect that when Modi becomes Prime Minister, people start thinking that things will get

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.360
[Guest]: some of those problems will get solved.

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:38.360
[Guest]: But then that also, you know, goes away in about 16 or so, even before demonetization.

01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:42.000
[Guest]: So demonetization doesn't actually have a great visible impact.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:49.000
[Guest]: So I was one of the, you know, very outspoken opponents of demonetization.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:55.520
[Guest]: But when I look back, I didn't see as much of an effect as I thought there might be.

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:58.800
[Guest]: But you know, be that as it may.

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.800
[Guest]: Investment didn't pick up again.

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:05.720
[Guest]: And we are, you know, I don't know where we will go in terms of, because the pandemic

01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:09.680
[Guest]: is I guess the last straw in this, because the more the uncertainty, investment always

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.120
[Guest]: does badly under uncertainty.

01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:18.920
[Guest]: So if it didn't pick up from 2011 onwards, then this is not a time when I would think

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:21.120
[Guest]: it's going to pick up very fast.

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.400
[Guest]: Things will take time to work out.

01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:28.240
[Guest]: So that's the backstory I would add to Pooja's story.

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:32.440
[Amit Varma]: How much of a factor in investments picking up is a quantitative easing, for example,

01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:35.640
[Amit Varma]: which happens out there, which happens in the US, for example, the easy money coming

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:40.560
[Amit Varma]: in, so to say, because there is some of that happening right now after this pandemic, and

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.240
[Amit Varma]: some of it will find its way into India.

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:46.040
[Amit Varma]: In fact, some of it is why the stock market has done much better than you would expect

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:48.400
[Amit Varma]: it to in these economic circumstances.

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:54.480
[Amit Varma]: So are certain aspects of how our economy does independent of our economy itself?

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.120
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:59.760
[Guest]: They are, but I think it's also about what is our policy response.

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:03.920
[Guest]: So episodes such as the taper tantrum.

01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:09.480
[Guest]: So in 2013, when Ben Bernanke was expected to, you know, when he spoke and people thought

01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:14.080
[Guest]: that the Fed is going to start tightening right away, then money started flowing out

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:17.440
[Guest]: of emerging economies.

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:21.700
[Guest]: India's response was that we want to defend the rupee.

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:27.600
[Guest]: And to try to defend the rupee, you know, we had Chidambaram and finance secretary and

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:33.280
[Guest]: everybody just coming on TV every day, hiking up interest rates.

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.280
[Guest]: This was a big mistake.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:38.320
[Guest]: I mean, the rupee kept slipping.

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:39.720
[Guest]: They couldn't stop that.

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:44.920
[Guest]: But they tightened monetary policy so much that, I mean, that's one thing that's really

01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:47.720
[Guest]: hurt the system.

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:51.480
[Guest]: Because rates didn't go back down for a very long time.

01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:56.320
[Guest]: And so they didn't reverse, almost for a year, they didn't reverse all the measures that

01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:02.480
[Guest]: they had taken in the rupee defense of 2013, after the taper tantrum.

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:12.200
[Guest]: And so let's just look forward now, see US is arguably overheating, because they've given

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:15.160
[Guest]: a large fiscal stimulus and a large monetary stimulus.

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:20.000
[Guest]: And if they're overheating, and if they start seeing inflation and the Fed starts tightening,

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.560
[Guest]: then we could easily have again this risk on risk off situation where money goes out

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.100
[Guest]: of emerging economies.

01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:32.440
[Guest]: The question would be what is going to be the policy response of the government and

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:37.600
[Guest]: the RBI, if they start trying to defend the rupee, if this happens.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.440
[Guest]: So if it doesn't happen, fine.

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:44.440
[Guest]: If this happens and they start trying to defend the rupee, and for that they tighten liquidity,

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:53.880
[Guest]: raise interest rates, like they did in 2013, then whatever little chance we have of, you

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:59.600
[Guest]: know, somehow getting up and trying to walk, we lose that as well.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:06.440
[Guest]: So the policy response, to a very large extent will determine the impact of what happens

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:10.480
[Guest]: in the US on us.

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:11.560
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of questions.

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:17.080
[Amit Varma]: One is that it's kind of amusing to me how somehow in the popular narrative, the where

01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:21.080
[Amit Varma]: the rupee was got tied up with nationalism, that if the rupee was strong, we would be

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:25.080
[Amit Varma]: proud and if the rupee was weak, we would be nahin yaar, woh dollar ko itna aage nahin

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:26.080
[Amit Varma]: jaane dene ka.

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.960
[Amit Varma]: So you know, how much of that is kind of a barrier and then if the if the popular sentiment

01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:35.960
[Amit Varma]: becomes like this, and definitely a lot of Modi's campaigning pre 2014 was look what

01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:40.080
[Amit Varma]: is happening to the rupee, and of course, forget what happened to it after he took over.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:44.920
[Amit Varma]: How much of this then involves the actual policy response like does it even matter like

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:48.440
[Amit Varma]: shouldn't the rupee be wherever it is and we should simply not bother about it.

01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:49.440
[Amit Varma]: That's what I would imagine.

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.400
[Amit Varma]: What's what's your take on that?

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:57.200
[Guest]: So if you look back, it's a very interesting story that in the early 2000s, there was this

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:01.880
[Guest]: huge attempt to prevent rupee appreciation.

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:04.520
[Guest]: You wanted a weak rupee and why was that?

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:08.300
[Guest]: Because the dominant lobby was the exporter lobby.

01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:13.560
[Guest]: The exporters were all the time, you know, whatever their federations are, whoever the

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:21.680
[Guest]: exporters are, their industry lobbies, somehow, they always convince economists to say what

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:28.000
[Guest]: they want said, but there was a lot of this, don't let the rupee get strong, CEO opened

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.240
[Guest]: up capital flows, now capital is coming in, pushing the rupee up, making us uncompetitive,

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:35.520
[Guest]: try to prevent rupee appreciation.

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:41.360
[Guest]: And then RBI went on this major thing of trying to buy up rupees, preventing an appreciation.

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:45.040
[Guest]: And then sometime in January 2004, they ran out of government bonds to sterilize their

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:48.440
[Guest]: intervention because they were doing fully sterilized intervention because this was the

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:49.440
[Guest]: second episode.

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:52.200
[Unknown]: Remember, they hadn't done that in 96.

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:56.200
[Guest]: So now, why did the situation change?

01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:01.760
[Guest]: In my opinion, the situation changed because once you allowed foreign borrowing, dollar

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:06.560
[Guest]: denominated borrowing, then the people who were borrowing in dollars had a lot of dollar

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:07.920
[Guest]: exposure.

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:10.840
[Guest]: So they don't want a weak rupee.

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:17.880
[Guest]: And in terms of the political influence and the, you know, cacophony, the everything,

01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:23.360
[Guest]: the need for a strong rupee became more important than the need for a weak rupee.

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:29.620
[Guest]: The exporters had wanted a weak rupee, whereas the firms who have dollar denominated borrowings

01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:35.000
[Guest]: on their balance sheets, they want a strong rupee.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.720
[Guest]: So I don't think it's that much of nationalism.

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:42.320
[Guest]: Of course, you know, somebody might say this or that, but I think eventually, at least

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:49.360
[Guest]: what I see getting translated into policy and pressure for a certain kind of policy

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:54.860
[Guest]: is how is industry getting impacted by the movement of the rupee, because there's a lot

01:41:54.860 --> 01:42:00.360
[Guest]: of exposure and that exposure, foreign currency exposure, which means that firms will get

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:03.140
[Guest]: hit when the rupee moves.

01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:09.520
[Guest]: And this exposure is there because, you know, RBI is constantly intervening to try to prevent

01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:14.060
[Guest]: rupee, they call it volatility, let me call it flexibility, as you've just called it.

01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:17.780
[Guest]: They try to prevent the rupee from moving around too much.

01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:23.000
[Guest]: So when they try to prevent it, people think, aha, I can take, now they'll take care.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.980
[Guest]: So the rupee won't weaken too much or the rupee won't strengthen too much.

01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:29.340
[Guest]: So you get a lot of foreign currency exposure.

01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:34.120
[Guest]: This is part of the reason why you always have some sort of a pressure on RBI to do

01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:36.200
[Amit Varma]: something or the other.

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:40.180
[Amit Varma]: And what's your recommended response to these kinds of pressures?

01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:47.540
[Guest]: Because exactly as yours was, stay out of it, just stay out of it, let it go wherever.

01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:50.020
[Guest]: And people will hedge their risks then.

01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:53.940
[Guest]: Today, it's a moral hazard problem, are not hedging their risk because they come back

01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:58.700
[Guest]: and scream at you, don't let the rupee this, don't let the rupee that, intervene, intervene,

01:42:58.700 --> 01:42:59.700
[Guest]: intervene.

01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:00.700
[Guest]: Oh, this has happened.

01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:02.340
[Guest]: And then the RBI steps in and intervenes.

01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:08.660
[Guest]: Whereas if you allow it to be volatile, to be flexible, people will hedge and you won't

01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:13.420
[Guest]: get that kind of exposure, currency exposure.

01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:17.100
[Amit Varma]: So one of your core causes, and before we get to the COVID economy and all of that,

01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:20.260
[Amit Varma]: one of your core causes through all this time and something that you're known for and that

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:23.980
[Amit Varma]: mutual friends speak very highly of is your work on inflation targeting.

01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:27.740
[Amit Varma]: So I'd like to kind of try and ask you to demystify it a bit.

01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:31.900
[Amit Varma]: So first of all, I'll quickly kind of sum up what the role that monetary policy plays

01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:32.900
[Amit Varma]: in terms of inflation.

01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:36.220
[Amit Varma]: And you can correct me if I'm being too simplistic or if I mess up somewhere.

01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:40.900
[Amit Varma]: But basically what happens is that the RBI controls, your central bank controls the flow

01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:42.380
[Amit Varma]: of money into the economy.

01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:46.600
[Amit Varma]: So they can lower interest rates, which would mean that there is effectively a greater flow

01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:47.600
[Amit Varma]: of money into the economy.

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:51.820
[Amit Varma]: And if the money supply goes up, but everything else remains the same, the prices of everything

01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:52.820
[Amit Varma]: will rise.

01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:53.980
[Amit Varma]: It's a supply and demand thing.

01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:58.620
[Amit Varma]: And it's the opposite thing that if they tighten it, then, you know, there is less money out

01:43:58.620 --> 01:43:59.620
[Amit Varma]: there.

01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:04.380
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the price of everything might even go down or it'll affect the rate of inflation.

01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:09.620
[Amit Varma]: And the reason for the political impetus for loosening interest rates would be that, you

01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:13.580
[Amit Varma]: know, in the short term, you get, you know, more money out there, there's more buoyancy,

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:14.580
[Amit Varma]: there's more spending.

01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:17.540
[Amit Varma]: And that makes the economy kind of look better.

01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:21.620
[Amit Varma]: So that is kind of one of the pressures that you sort of have to balance.

01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:28.780
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, one is this summation broadly correct in its necessarily simplistic way.

01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:30.580
[Amit Varma]: And two, what then is inflation targeting?

01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:34.200
[Amit Varma]: Like, is there an ideal rate of inflation that we should have?

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:37.360
[Amit Varma]: What is the role of a central bank here?

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:42.780
[Amit Varma]: Can you then demystify all of this that why did this become such an important thing?

01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:50.720
[Guest]: Yeah, so let's say that we have an economy that tries to target the exchange rate.

01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.260
[Guest]: It doesn't care about inflation.

01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:53.780
[Guest]: It targets the exchange rate.

01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:57.380
[Guest]: It wants a stable rupee.

01:44:57.380 --> 01:45:04.020
[Guest]: And as a consequence, we do what we did, let's say, what Bimal Jalan did in the Asian crisis,

01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:08.460
[Guest]: that when there was pressure on the rupee to depreciate, he hiked up interest rates

01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:14.500
[Guest]: by 200 basis point on 16th of January 1999 on one single day.

01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:20.060
[Guest]: Similarly, we do what we did during the period of the Tipper Tantrum that we thought the

01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:22.420
[Guest]: rupee is weak or will weaken.

01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:26.200
[Guest]: So we hiked short-term rates, tighten liquidity.

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:32.140
[Guest]: What we're doing then is that let's assume that at that time, which is true in this case,

01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:36.380
[Guest]: but let's assume at that time the economy is not doing very well.

01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:40.580
[Guest]: Then what you end up doing is making it worse.

01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:46.540
[Guest]: Because the economy was already weak and because of that, perhaps, you know, you got this pressure

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:47.540
[Guest]: on the rupee.

01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:53.940
[Guest]: Now, we were repeatedly seeing episodes of that happen, that, you know, the economy needed

01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:54.940
[Guest]: something.

01:45:54.940 --> 01:46:00.220
[Guest]: Okay, so your business cycle conditions were such that we needed an accommodative or lose

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:01.940
[Guest]: monetary policy.

01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:07.740
[Guest]: But what happened instead was that because you were trying to defend the rupee, you went

01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:10.180
[Guest]: and hiked rates.

01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:17.100
[Guest]: What that does is actually makes your policy pro-cyclical.

01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:21.860
[Guest]: You were already going down and it makes you go down further.

01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:25.340
[Amit Varma]: Because there's less spending and so on.

01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:31.380
[Guest]: Because of what you described just now that when interest rates are higher, so you've

01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:34.080
[Guest]: hiked rates to defend the rupee, right?

01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:37.580
[Guest]: But when rates are higher, people borrow less, people spend less, you know.

01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:43.060
[Guest]: So that's why rates get raised when inflation goes up or when, as we just talked about,

01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:45.340
[Guest]: the US economy overheating.

01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:48.580
[Guest]: So when it is overheating, the Fed may raise interest rates.

01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:52.820
[Guest]: So when there's too much demand in the economy, you try to bring it down.

01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:55.460
[Guest]: So we were seeing a lot of that happen.

01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:59.620
[Guest]: So in the Indian context, why did inflation targeting make sense?

01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:01.620
[Guest]: And why did the government go ahead with it?

01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:05.780
[Guest]: It's not because, you know, some of us write about things, we write about many things.

01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:13.580
[Guest]: But why it made sense was that repeatedly there were these episodes when you were doing

01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:19.780
[Guest]: something which was actually bad for the wider economy as a whole.

01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:23.340
[Guest]: So while it might have given you rupee stabilization.

01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:24.980
[Guest]: So that was the choice.

01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:30.020
[Guest]: The third choice, which would have been to close the capital account, we don't have that

01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:31.140
[Guest]: choice anymore.

01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:32.900
[Guest]: So we are such a global economy.

01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:38.260
[Guest]: And anyway, even if we try to close some accounts, money finds a way to move around.

01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:40.220
[Guest]: So we don't want to go there.

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:45.420
[Guest]: Though sometimes, you know, they do try to impose some capital controls, gold, this,

01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:46.420
[Guest]: that and the other.

01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:48.540
[Guest]: That tendency is very much there.

01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:49.540
[Guest]: Okay.

01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:53.380
[Guest]: But as you said earlier, the mindset of trying to control is very much there.

01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:57.140
[Guest]: But let's just say that, you know, we put that aside because that's not going to solve

01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:58.140
[Guest]: your problem.

01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:03.660
[Guest]: So then you have a choice between these two things, between trying to stabilize the currency,

01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:09.100
[Guest]: which could be pro cyclical, if your economy is on a decline and your hiking rates, you're

01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:10.780
[Guest]: just doing the wrong thing.

01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:16.820
[Guest]: And the other is that you respond to the business cycle conditions in the economy.

01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:24.340
[Guest]: So while we say inflation targeting, but actually inflation doesn't happen on some island on

01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:25.780
[Guest]: its own.

01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:30.940
[Guest]: Inflation is happening when there is excess demand in the economy.

01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:34.140
[Guest]: And that is happening when the economy is on upswing.

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:37.820
[Guest]: So what you're really trying to do is to stabilize the business cycle.

01:48:37.820 --> 01:48:41.620
[Guest]: You're trying to do counter cyclical monetary policy.

01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:46.280
[Guest]: That's the essence of why inflation targeting makes sense.

01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:50.580
[Amit Varma]: So now a further question, because from the term, it would seem that there is an optimal

01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:52.500
[Amit Varma]: rate of inflation you have to maintain.

01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:54.540
[Amit Varma]: So is there an optimal rate of inflation?

01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:55.900
[Amit Varma]: And why is it optimal?

01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:58.140
[Amit Varma]: And how does one arrive at it?

01:48:58.140 --> 01:48:59.140
[Amit Varma]: And so on.

01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:00.140
[Guest]: Broader question.

01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:03.540
[Guest]: So I think Raghu was the governor at that time.

01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:11.820
[Guest]: And this one was chosen as 2% above the inflation target in advanced economies.

01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:17.500
[Guest]: So advanced economies have roughly 2% and you want a positive inflation rate because

01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:22.500
[Guest]: you want relative prices to be able to move and you can't really have disinflation.

01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:25.180
[Guest]: So that's painful for too many people.

01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:27.700
[Guest]: So the advanced economies have chosen 2%.

01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:33.900
[Guest]: Now if you kind of think, Bilasa Samuelson, that you're getting a productivity improvement

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:39.460
[Guest]: because you're an emerging economy, so you can have an inflation, you want to choose

01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:45.300
[Guest]: your target, your productivity improvement at a long term average rate of 2%.

01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:50.520
[Guest]: So your currency could kind of stay where it is roughly stable.

01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:57.540
[Guest]: You choose an inflation rate of 2% above the inflation target of advanced economies.

01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:00.020
[Guest]: So that's where that number came from.

01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:06.260
[Guest]: But the second number, which is our own number, is this 2 to 6.

01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:10.660
[Guest]: The 2 to 6 is the band around the 4% target.

01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:17.660
[Guest]: And that's really because one, inflation targeting was something so new and very few people really

01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:24.300
[Guest]: understood whether you'll actually be able to get to 4% inflation by moving around interest

01:50:24.300 --> 01:50:25.300
[Guest]: rates.

01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:29.240
[Guest]: And second, because monetary policy transmission is very, very weak.

01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:35.360
[Guest]: You don't have competitive, well-functioning bond markets and banks that would actually

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:37.020
[Guest]: do this transmission.

01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:42.260
[Guest]: So in the absence of a well-functioning monetary policy transmission, you don't want a very

01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:47.180
[Guest]: tight target because then you would have to hike rates around, you have to jack them around

01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:48.980
[Guest]: up and down depending on the inflation.

01:50:48.980 --> 01:50:52.980
[Guest]: So what you want to do is get a bit of flexibility there.

01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:53.980
[Amit Varma]: Makes sense.

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:56.140
[Amit Varma]: Let's now come to the current time.

01:50:56.140 --> 01:51:00.980
[Amit Varma]: Before COVID struck, let's say maybe February last year, before COVID struck, if you were

01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:06.580
[Amit Varma]: to sort of talk about the state of the economy then, you know, not just in a static way,

01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:11.020
[Amit Varma]: but as you know, part of different trends that have been playing out, how would you

01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:13.020
[Amit Varma]: then sort of sum that up?

01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:17.660
[Amit Varma]: Like for example, I've done episodes on the credit crisis with Arvind, Viral, various

01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:18.660
[Amit Varma]: people.

01:51:18.660 --> 01:51:20.400
[Amit Varma]: And you know, what was the state of that?

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:22.660
[Amit Varma]: What was the state of our economy generally?

01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:25.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, what did it look like before COVID struck?

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.660
[Amit Varma]: Because I think it's important also to kind of think about that before we get down to

01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:33.740
[Amit Varma]: talking about the impact of COVID, like I'd done an episode with Vivek Kaul on the Indian

01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:35.180
[Amit Varma]: economy in 2019.

01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:39.460
[Amit Varma]: And I remember, you know, everything we had to say was extremely bleak anyway.

01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:44.100
[Amit Varma]: It feels like, you know, things were just going downhill, things look pretty bad.

01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:46.740
[Amit Varma]: What was your sense of it at the time?

01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:48.920
[Guest]: I was worrying about two things.

01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:53.380
[Guest]: I was worrying about the fact that investment had still not picked up.

01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:59.380
[Guest]: And second, about the non-performing assets in the banking system.

01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:05.900
[Guest]: And that basically, I thought that this was a time when we should start moving towards

01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:08.580
[Guest]: privatization of public sector banks.

01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:15.900
[Guest]: And you know, some of the stuff I was writing was that unless we move away from this public

01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:22.820
[Guest]: sector banking setup that we somehow seem to be stuck with, we will actually not be

01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:24.180
[Guest]: able to recover.

01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:30.020
[Guest]: Third, that we have not done the financial sector reforms that are needed for us to be

01:52:30.020 --> 01:52:33.020
[Guest]: able to get back on track.

01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:37.220
[Guest]: You know, so the kind of things that need to be done are, one, a competitive banking

01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:43.060
[Guest]: system, which for me means either you reduce your shareholdership or you give a lot of

01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:45.140
[Guest]: private sector bank licenses.

01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:46.620
[Guest]: So that also brings competition.

01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:53.380
[Guest]: And you know, the telecom model or the aviation model where you don't, you know, you don't

01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:55.780
[Guest]: want to privatize them for whatever reason.

01:52:55.780 --> 01:53:00.740
[Guest]: The unions will make trouble or then give more licenses, but at least bring competition

01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:02.220
[Guest]: into the sector.

01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:07.020
[Guest]: So I thought that was a difficult enough agenda.

01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:14.780
[Guest]: But I mean, that was mainly the investment, credit, the shape of the banking sector were

01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:16.140
[Amit Varma]: what were worrying me.

01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:19.780
[Amit Varma]: You know, on a tangent, since we are reaching COVID, I came across this interesting paper

01:53:19.780 --> 01:53:24.580
[Amit Varma]: you wrote with Supriya Krishnan called Health and Disaster Risk Management in India, which

01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:29.460
[Amit Varma]: was published in February 2020, last year before the pandemic struck, where you're doing

01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:33.580
[Amit Varma]: various things, you're assessing our public health infrastructure and blah, blah, blah.

01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:37.820
[Amit Varma]: So to what extent, and you also talk about communicable diseases in it and so on.

01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:42.620
[Amit Varma]: So to what extent did, like, were there any new revelations or did things play out kind

01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:48.060
[Amit Varma]: of the way you expected that we were nowhere close to being prepared?

01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:53.380
[Guest]: I think even if we had been optimally prepared, according to whatever we were measuring in

01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:58.540
[Guest]: that paper, we would still have been unprepared because, you know, I don't think anybody can

01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:02.660
[Guest]: be prepared for this magnitude of so many people falling ill.

01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:07.780
[Guest]: You know, you're not going to ever have so many doctors and so many people, so many nurses

01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:12.980
[Guest]: and so many hospitals, because otherwise they'll be unprofitable and lying vacant for decades,

01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:13.980
[Guest]: you know.

01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:19.900
[Guest]: So some arrangements, you don't have arrangements for a tenfold increase in oxygen demand.

01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:22.260
[Guest]: You don't have arrangements for this.

01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:28.540
[Guest]: So I mean, that was taking into a, you know, just assuming a normal, not a pandemic like

01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:33.300
[Guest]: this, but we couldn't have been prepared.

01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:38.140
[Guest]: At least I felt that even if we'd done everything we could, we couldn't have been prepared for

01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:42.820
[Guest]: this kind of magnitude of the crisis, health crisis.

01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:47.500
[Amit Varma]: And given what we know in hindsight about how it was handled, assume that we use that

01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:51.540
[Amit Varma]: knowledge and we can go back in a time machine and do everything right, right?

01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:53.660
[Amit Varma]: So we end up with the best case scenario.

01:54:53.660 --> 01:54:55.260
[Amit Varma]: What do you think that would have been?

01:54:55.260 --> 01:55:01.540
[Guest]: I mean, we would have tested more, if we could have tested more, we could have, we would

01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:08.260
[Guest]: have done local lockdowns more because we didn't understand what the full implication

01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:15.060
[Guest]: of a national lockdown would be, we would have pre-ordered vaccines when they started,

01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:20.820
[Guest]: when people started working on vaccines, not even when they did trial, phase one trials,

01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:28.420
[Guest]: but, you know, we would have pre-ordered vaccines and, you know, prepared hospitals so that

01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:33.340
[Guest]: in case that we still get the disease, but you know, all this is with the benefit of

01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:34.340
[Guest]: hindsight.

01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:41.620
[Guest]: I must admit that neither I, nor any of the big critics that I hear talk about this, were

01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:45.500
[Guest]: writing that, how much pre-ordering of vaccines have you done?

01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:50.300
[Guest]: On the contrary, one heard people say, oh, Covaxin is not tested, why are you allowing

01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:51.300
[Guest]: it?

01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:53.780
[Guest]: And why are you buying it?

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:58.740
[Guest]: So with the benefit of hindsight, one can say a lot of things, but if I were to be honest

01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:04.460
[Guest]: and say that would I have figured out all this, then I don't think I would have figured

01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:05.460
[Guest]: out all this then.

01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:06.460
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:09.700
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you know, there's this really nice quote I came across where someone said that

01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:13.580
[Amit Varma]: if you act optimally, then before a pandemic, it will always seem like you are doing too

01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:14.580
[Amit Varma]: much.

01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:16.340
[Amit Varma]: You know, that's what it will seem like before.

01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:19.580
[Amit Varma]: And after a pandemic, it will always seem like you did too little.

01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:25.420
[Amit Varma]: It's just, you know, we are kind of in this very tough spot, but looking at the pandemic

01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:30.020
[Amit Varma]: as it kind of proceeded, I mean, obviously there are disasters at various levels like

01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:32.740
[Amit Varma]: the humanitarian disaster, and let's not even go into that.

01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:38.100
[Amit Varma]: But as an economist, when you're thinking of what is the economic impact of this, number

01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:44.220
[Amit Varma]: one, and number two, when you're thinking of what can we do to ameliorate it with whatever

01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:49.360
[Amit Varma]: limited resources we have, then tell me a little bit about what that kind of thinking

01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:54.680
[Amit Varma]: is like, like what kind of data gives you the fullest possible picture of this?

01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:58.340
[Amit Varma]: It appears to me that, you know, when the first lockdown happened, all the migrant labor

01:56:58.340 --> 01:56:59.500
[Amit Varma]: is going back.

01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:02.740
[Amit Varma]: You don't know what the sentiment is, you don't know how many of them are coming back.

01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:07.060
[Amit Varma]: Maybe there is some MNREGS data, which suddenly shows a spike, and you know that all these

01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:10.060
[Amit Varma]: people have come back from the cities, there's no work and blah, blah.

01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:13.780
[Amit Varma]: But you don't know the longer term sentiment and how it's going to play out when all these

01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:14.780
[Amit Varma]: people die.

01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:18.520
[Amit Varma]: Number one, what we are seeing today is that deaths are massively underreported.

01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:22.260
[Amit Varma]: You don't know how those deaths will affect things going forward.

01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:23.560
[Amit Varma]: So many things we don't know.

01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:26.220
[Amit Varma]: So how do you begin to make sense of what is going wrong?

01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:31.220
[Amit Varma]: And then how do you begin to make sense of what to do about it?

01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:36.460
[Guest]: Looking at CMI household survey data, the surveys are still continuing, does give you

01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:37.460
[Guest]: some sense.

01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:41.220
[Guest]: So they talk about, they ask you, are you looking for a job?

01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:43.460
[Guest]: So that's labor force participation.

01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:45.540
[Guest]: They ask you, are you employed?

01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:47.380
[Guest]: So that's the employment rate.

01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:50.280
[Guest]: They also ask you how many members of the family there are.

01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:54.060
[Guest]: So if there are some missing, which were there, so it's the same set of households, same set

01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:59.680
[Guest]: of, I think, 200,000 plus households that are interviewed three times a year.

01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:04.500
[Guest]: So you can make out, because it's the same household and you're going back to the household,

01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:12.300
[Guest]: so you can get some idea of the missing people there, or you also get data on expenditure

01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:18.420
[Guest]: that will tell you whether people are, so if they're eating less or spending less on

01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:20.180
[Guest]: what are they spending less.

01:58:20.180 --> 01:58:24.420
[Guest]: So the items on which they spend have been changing.

01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:30.260
[Guest]: And so that's something that some of us do look at.

01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:32.660
[Guest]: And of course, things are bad.

01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:40.660
[Guest]: I mean, I don't, the data is reflecting whatever that people have lost their jobs and many

01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:45.500
[Guest]: are dropping out of the labor force, but then that is something that one would expect.

01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:51.980
[Guest]: So that, you know, if that answers the data question, the question on what would you do?

01:58:51.980 --> 01:58:59.240
[Guest]: I mean, other than vaccinating and trying to do COVID appropriate behavior and not doing

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:06.900
[Guest]: the non-essential things that would hurt everyone, I'm not sure what else we can do.

01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:12.740
[Guest]: I think the way out is to vaccinate, to have COVID appropriate behavior, to let people

01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:18.300
[Guest]: come back to work when you feel that it's safe, and by now people are scared enough.

01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:26.160
[Guest]: So people who used to be, you know, I mean, out of the people who we've lost among friends

01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:31.600
[Guest]: and family, a lot of them were refusing to take the vaccine, but today their families

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:33.420
[Guest]: are queuing up for vaccines.

01:59:33.420 --> 01:59:40.780
[Guest]: So that vaccine, that hesitancy, the resistance to vaccine has gone away, at least, I mean,

01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:45.300
[Guest]: I don't have data on that, but the demand for vaccines has increased.

01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:52.460
[Guest]: So the gap may actually increase because as this spreads, till the supply comes back.

01:59:52.460 --> 01:59:54.220
[Guest]: So I think that's what you can do.

01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:58.880
[Guest]: So that at least people can come back to economic activity.

01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:06.220
[Guest]: You have to allow them to come back and the economy will, I think, you know, people who

02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:10.780
[Guest]: either had COVID or had a vaccine will be able to get back to work pretty soon.

02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:16.380
[Guest]: I mean, those who are not, you know, suffering from some of the ill effects other than that,

02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:19.980
[Guest]: many will be, most will be able to come back to work pretty soon.

02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:23.820
[Amit Varma]: And in terms of economic policy at the government level, is there something special that the

02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:27.460
[Amit Varma]: government can do that one would not recommend that it does otherwise?

02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:32.500
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example, people speak about put a special stimulus out there or whatever,

02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:35.940
[Amit Varma]: you know, fiscal policy, monetary policy.

02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:38.500
[Amit Varma]: What is your sense of what can and should be done there?

02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:43.780
[Amit Varma]: Like, is there something that should be done now that would not otherwise have been necessary

02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:45.700
[Guest]: in normal times?

02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:48.900
[Guest]: So maybe you can cut taxes and borrow.

02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:52.460
[Guest]: You can cut import duties that might boost your exports.

02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:58.900
[Guest]: You can cut taxes so whoever's having to pay an 18% GST on something gets a relief.

02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:02.900
[Guest]: And the government, I'm not saying it can borrow too much because, you know, it doesn't

02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:04.540
[Guest]: have much fiscal space.

02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:11.460
[Guest]: But to some extent, this is the way to provide relief, rather than to try to find who all

02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:12.740
[Guest]: to pay to.

02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:17.900
[Guest]: I would just say cutting taxes gives everybody relief across the board.

02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:22.900
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you know, in fact, I saw this very interesting Elonomics episode of yours where you spoke

02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:26.900
[Amit Varma]: about the absurdity of cutting the personal income tax while raising GST.

02:01:26.900 --> 02:01:32.140
[Amit Varma]: And you're like, whatever, you know, it doesn't, it's not kind of remotely coherent.

02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:35.340
[Amit Varma]: And of course, the idea of cutting taxes is you leave the money in the hands of the people,

02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:40.940
[Amit Varma]: you know, which leads me to sort of this interesting question about how so and this is again a

02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:46.260
[Amit Varma]: sort of a mindset question where so many people in government will often behave as if one

02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:51.380
[Amit Varma]: of the aims or one of the metrics of a healthy economy is how much your tax collections have

02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:52.380
[Amit Varma]: gone up.

02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:56.860
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not sure that's such a great metric because, you know, that tells you something

02:01:56.860 --> 02:02:00.340
[Amit Varma]: about the health of the state and the state is, of course, a predatory state.

02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:02.020
[Amit Varma]: So do you really want it to be healthy?

02:02:02.020 --> 02:02:04.740
[Amit Varma]: You know, while your focus should be on the health of society.

02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:08.940
[Amit Varma]: So is this something that you have thoughts on?

02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:14.660
[Guest]: Sometimes I wonder, when I look at bureaucrats, I wonder that is the way to increase the tax

02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:18.500
[Guest]: GDP ratio done through reducing the denominator?

02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:27.420
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, they don't care, they don't care, they don't care that you impose taxes that

02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:30.300
[Guest]: are actually going to reduce investment.

02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:34.220
[Guest]: So you do some retrospective tax, right, you'll get some X crore rupees.

02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:38.420
[Guest]: But you end up reducing investment, you end up reducing GDP.

02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:43.220
[Guest]: And that's how your, you know, tax to GDP ratio may look better.

02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:47.420
[Guest]: But I mean, I'm kidding, I'm, you know, this is the...

02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:51.860
[Unknown]: You know, you're kidding, but you're not really kidding.

02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:54.100
[Guest]: I mean, basically, they don't care.

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:58.860
[Guest]: I think what's happened is that the tax administration is in charge of tax policy.

02:02:58.860 --> 02:03:03.540
[Guest]: On a more serious note, that separation is essential.

02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:10.660
[Guest]: Because the job of tax administration is given what we have, we have to, you know, collect

02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:15.100
[Guest]: taxes without too much cost, and there has to be improved compliance and so on.

02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:23.460
[Guest]: But the role of tax policy is to make taxes such that we improve output, we improve productivity,

02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:30.420
[Guest]: we don't put, you know, deadweight loss on the economy, we don't put extra burden on the economy.

02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:37.740
[Guest]: Because we don't have much tax policy thinking outside of tax administration.

02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:44.500
[Guest]: I think that the way tax policy gets made in India, it's blind to the impact on GDP.

02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:50.660
[Guest]: We started this conversation talking about, you know, retrospective taxes, your interview

02:03:50.660 --> 02:03:57.780
[Guest]: with Pooja, and how that actually turned the economy around, we are 10 years later, maybe

02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:03.300
[Guest]: a little more than 10 years later, we are still suffering the impact of trying to collect

02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:06.140
[Guest]: just this much of more of taxes.

02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:08.500
[Guest]: So I have very strong views on that.

02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:10.300
[Amit Varma]: But that's kind of...

02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:14.820
[Amit Varma]: No, like you said, it's completely nuts that the tax administration people should have

02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:19.700
[Amit Varma]: so much influence on tax policy, because obviously, they'll want more money to spend, who kind

02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:20.700
[Amit Varma]: of wouldn't.

02:04:20.700 --> 02:04:24.140
[Amit Varma]: And I'll bring you into another issue you've written about, you know, a couple of episodes

02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:28.460
[Amit Varma]: ago, I had Karthik Mulyadharan on my show, The Economist, and we were talking health

02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:29.460
[Amit Varma]: care policy.

02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:32.460
[Amit Varma]: But one of the digressions we took was the petrol taxes.

02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:36.980
[Amit Varma]: And I said, the high petrol taxes are a bad thing, because they affect the common person,

02:04:36.980 --> 02:04:38.820
[Amit Varma]: inflationary effect, blah, blah, blah.

02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:41.980
[Amit Varma]: And he was defending it from a public finance point of view, saying that if the government

02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:44.980
[Amit Varma]: collects taxes, that's how I would like them to collect it.

02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:47.180
[Amit Varma]: What's your view on this?

02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:49.620
[Guest]: So I'm very conflicted.

02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:56.060
[Guest]: On the one hand, I think, you know, it's a carbon tax, it reduces your consumption of,

02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:58.160
[Guest]: you know, carbon fuels.

02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:04.180
[Guest]: And so, in one sense, I think that, you know, I should not be saying anything.

02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:09.420
[Guest]: But on the other hand, I feel that in the period when oil prices were declining, the

02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:14.740
[Guest]: FISC became too dependent on these taxes.

02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:23.100
[Guest]: And you know, today, you're paying so much more taxes than the actual fuel, it hurts.

02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:28.500
[Guest]: And today, the FISC cannot do away with these taxes, because they've become too dependent

02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:29.980
[Guest]: on them.

02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:35.180
[Guest]: And in that perspective, as you know, an economist, I would say that I don't think this is good

02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:40.260
[Guest]: public finance when you're too dependent on any one kind of tax on this, apart from everything

02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:41.820
[Guest]: that you have said.

02:05:41.820 --> 02:05:45.460
[Guest]: So but you know, because it's a carbon tax, I'm a little conflicted.

02:05:45.460 --> 02:05:49.500
[Guest]: If this was on gold, I might say something else.

02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:51.740
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no.

02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:55.820
[Amit Varma]: And just to kind of give perspective to those listeners, you know, after 2014, Modi got

02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:59.420
[Amit Varma]: this massive bonanza when oil prices, global oil prices went down.

02:05:59.420 --> 02:06:02.620
[Amit Varma]: And he could have chosen to let petrol prices in India come down.

02:06:02.620 --> 02:06:05.620
[Amit Varma]: And that benefit would have been passed on to people, not just people who drive cars,

02:06:05.620 --> 02:06:09.420
[Amit Varma]: by the way, but petrol prices affect everything, everything would have become cheaper.

02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:11.500
[Amit Varma]: But instead, they just raise the taxes.

02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:15.200
[Amit Varma]: So it seemed to the common person that okay, petrol prices haven't really gone up.

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:18.300
[Amit Varma]: But we were just you know, the tax became a larger percentage of that.

02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:20.700
[Amit Varma]: And now the taxes only go up, they don't go down.

02:06:20.700 --> 02:06:22.220
[Amit Varma]: So that's something to think about.

02:06:22.220 --> 02:06:24.180
[Amit Varma]: I'll link to an article you wrote on this.

02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:27.580
[Amit Varma]: So to be honest, right, when I asked you, I did know that you would kind of come out

02:06:27.580 --> 02:06:31.740
[Amit Varma]: on my side on this, I will send that link to Karthik.

02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:37.420
[Amit Varma]: So a final big question before we end up by talking about the COVID scenario also, you

02:06:37.420 --> 02:06:43.100
[Amit Varma]: know, when we kind of look at the Indian economy, like whenever I talk about problems in India,

02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:49.660
[Amit Varma]: whether it's in agriculture, in whatever, within that bigger problem, there is a subset

02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:53.020
[Amit Varma]: that is even worse, which is the role of women in it, right.

02:06:53.020 --> 02:06:56.860
[Amit Varma]: And I'd done an episode with Namita Bhandare on the women's participation in the labor

02:06:56.860 --> 02:07:01.860
[Amit Varma]: force, where she pointed out that it's actually gone down over the last sort of decade and

02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:06.740
[Amit Varma]: a half that there are less women in percentage terms working today than was the case.

02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:10.260
[Amit Varma]: And even before COVID, you would expect the opposite to be the case, because the economy

02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:12.940
[Amit Varma]: has been growing, everything is fine.

02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:14.700
[Amit Varma]: Why are less women working?

02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:19.740
[Amit Varma]: And it also seems to me that there's a massive loss there, the fact that of course, I mean,

02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:25.260
[Amit Varma]: some of it is cultural issues, that, you know, we have this very misogynistic backward view

02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:28.740
[Amit Varma]: of women that a woman's places in the kitchen and blah, blah, blah, and some of those are

02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:29.980
[Amit Varma]: cultural issues.

02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:35.220
[Amit Varma]: But there is a massive loss in terms of, you know, just productivity, human capital, all

02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:39.460
[Amit Varma]: of that, the fact that half our people are almost, you know, treated differently.

02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:44.540
[Amit Varma]: And you know, given this kind of inferior status, and therefore inferior opportunities.

02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:47.020
[Amit Varma]: So what is your sense of that?

02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:52.220
[Amit Varma]: Like, is there any way to kind of quantify, say, whether it's the unpaid labor of women

02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:56.300
[Amit Varma]: or quantify the opportunity cost that what if, you know, women were getting the same

02:07:56.300 --> 02:07:57.820
[Amit Varma]: kind of opportunities?

02:07:57.820 --> 02:08:01.620
[Amit Varma]: And also, when you look at the general drift, what is the tendency?

02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:05.180
[Amit Varma]: Is there reason to hope in this in this regard?

02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:12.940
[Guest]: So I think one of the big factors is the economy, that when employment doesn't grow fast enough,

02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:17.060
[Guest]: then within a family, it is the male who takes up a job rather than the female.

02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:21.500
[Guest]: So if one of them is going to be able to go out and work, then who goes out to work?

02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:25.740
[Guest]: So she does the childcare, she does the homework, and the male goes out to work.

02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:31.420
[Guest]: So the, you know, aggregate rate of growth of jobs, if that slows down, it is going to,

02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:35.220
[Guest]: in my opinion, it also impacts how many women go out to work.

02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:38.980
[Guest]: The second thing that has been happening here, so there have, you know, this is an issue

02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:41.740
[Guest]: that has been studied by quite a few people.

02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:48.020
[Guest]: The second thing that seems to be happening here is that as the family income goes up

02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:53.980
[Guest]: because the male earns more, then the woman actually stays at home because she's able

02:08:53.980 --> 02:09:01.060
[Guest]: to give her children childcare, which she cannot afford if the male earns less.

02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:06.020
[Guest]: And this is a paradoxical situation where it's not very easy to say, what would you

02:09:06.020 --> 02:09:07.020
[Guest]: want?

02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:08.020
[Guest]: Do you want him to earn less?

02:09:08.020 --> 02:09:09.020
[Guest]: No, you don't.

02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:13.580
[Guest]: You want him to earn more and her to be able to go out, but are there good facilities for

02:09:13.580 --> 02:09:14.580
[Guest]: childcare?

02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:15.580
[Guest]: No, there aren't.

02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:20.740
[Guest]: So, you know, you find that women usually are the ones who would say they would stay

02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:24.940
[Guest]: back even though they could have got a job.

02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:29.300
[Guest]: The first is clearly a bad, the second is a paradoxical one.

02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:31.740
[Guest]: And I think the third is that women migrate.

02:09:31.740 --> 02:09:34.580
[Guest]: So when married women migrate a lot.

02:09:34.580 --> 02:09:40.220
[Guest]: So when you look at migration data, a lot of migration is happening because the woman

02:09:40.220 --> 02:09:45.340
[Guest]: goes and, you know, goes to the village where her husband and his family live.

02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:48.580
[Guest]: And there it is not very easy for her to find a job.

02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:51.620
[Guest]: I mean, you don't have these thriving labor markets.

02:09:51.620 --> 02:09:54.980
[Guest]: Of course, then also they try to, some of them get jobs.

02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:56.580
[Guest]: I'm not saying it's zero.

02:09:56.580 --> 02:10:03.380
[Guest]: But both society, you know, the society is very conservative, a young bride in a village

02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:09.300
[Guest]: is not expected to come and start working if they can afford to have her stay at home

02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:11.940
[Guest]: and look after her kids.

02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:17.540
[Guest]: So it's both cultural, it is the economy.

02:10:17.540 --> 02:10:22.940
[Guest]: And then, of course, it is skill development that if the man starts earning more, then

02:10:22.940 --> 02:10:27.700
[Guest]: and he becomes more skilled, even if she's also skilled, if they both get skilled.

02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:32.380
[Guest]: But if the household income allows her to look after the children, then she does that.

02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:33.380
[Guest]: So it's a combination.

02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:35.860
[Guest]: I think it's a very complex issue.

02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:38.420
[Guest]: It's not an easy one for us to solve looking ahead.

02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:43.300
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I done this episode with Chinmay Tumbay on his great book, India Moving, about migration

02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:44.300
[Amit Varma]: in and outside India.

02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:48.300
[Amit Varma]: And one of the great TIL moments for me there was when he said that the largest cause of

02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:52.380
[Amit Varma]: internal migration within the country is just women getting married and going to their husband's

02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:53.780
[Amit Varma]: home, which is something to my shame.

02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:58.900
[Amit Varma]: I had never even thought about it in those terms, but suddenly it just becomes so stark.

02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:02.820
[Amit Varma]: And Namita had, of course, also mentioned that this happens that as the men start earning

02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:06.740
[Amit Varma]: more, the women kind of drop out because they can actually afford to stay at home.

02:11:06.740 --> 02:11:10.860
[Amit Varma]: And I would therefore imagine that when the men start earning so much more, that the women

02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:14.780
[Amit Varma]: don't have to drop out, that they can also work and find satisfaction elsewhere that

02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:16.180
[Amit Varma]: maybe then that rate goes up.

02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:20.460
[Amit Varma]: So is it then like a kind of a reverse bell curve there in terms of women's participation?

02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:24.020
[Amit Varma]: Do you think, is there any data from anywhere in the world which gives us a clue?

02:11:24.020 --> 02:11:30.580
[Guest]: So I don't particularly do women's studies, I am a macroeconomist.

02:11:30.580 --> 02:11:34.940
[Guest]: I don't know whether there's data elsewhere in the world, but I think we'll be a long

02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:35.940
[Guest]: way from that.

02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:40.140
[Guest]: I mean, there will be sections of society which will start moving, but how that affects

02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:41.340
[Guest]: the aggregate.

02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:48.860
[Guest]: It might be that we see lower reduced labor force participation of women for a long time.

02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:54.340
[Guest]: And particularly given the schools and the way they are, given the childcare facilities

02:11:54.340 --> 02:12:01.700
[Guest]: the way they are, it's very hard for a woman to leave her children anywhere and go off

02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:02.700
[Guest]: for a whole day.

02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:08.300
[Guest]: I mean, maybe work from home helps, maybe it's going to put double burden on her, but

02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:11.300
[Guest]: still she'll be able to work.

02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:17.060
[Guest]: And if she doesn't have to leave her children and go, I think it's a very difficult issue.

02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:19.660
[Guest]: In fact, around the world you see that.

02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:24.820
[Guest]: So if you look at Switzerland, for example, I read a paper which was talking about how

02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:31.140
[Guest]: one member of the family works, because a lot of studies are showing that when children

02:12:31.140 --> 02:12:36.860
[Guest]: are brought up by their parents, by them, you know, mother or father, and they are spoken

02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:41.180
[Guest]: to, they become more intelligent, they become better human beings.

02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:46.860
[Guest]: So instead of leaving children in creches where it's rather impersonal, as a society,

02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:51.300
[Guest]: I think her contribution today, whether we measure it in income, whether we measure it

02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:58.860
[Guest]: in GDP, but she's making a very big contribution when she's looking after her own children.

02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:02.340
[Guest]: So I'm not sure where we will go on this.

02:13:02.340 --> 02:13:09.420
[Guest]: So if we jump stages and go the way some advanced economies are going, we could well be saying

02:13:09.420 --> 02:13:16.740
[Guest]: that either parent, when both are getting skilled, for example, it's not necessarily

02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:21.180
[Guest]: that the man has to go out and work, but he could be the one who could be looking after

02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:22.180
[Guest]: the children.

02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:26.060
[Amit Varma]: And speaking of jumping stages, I think the first imperative for the Indian economy would

02:13:26.060 --> 02:13:29.980
[Amit Varma]: be to get back to where it was before COVID kind of did what it did.

02:13:29.980 --> 02:13:31.580
[Amit Varma]: So I have three final questions for you.

02:13:31.580 --> 02:13:34.500
[Amit Varma]: And one of them is about economics, but the last two are not.

02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:39.180
[Amit Varma]: And so here's the economics one, that, you know, just looking at where we are today,

02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:42.620
[Amit Varma]: looking at the fact that the second wave is still kind of going on, that is devastating

02:13:42.620 --> 02:13:43.820
[Amit Varma]: rural India.

02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:45.740
[Amit Varma]: We don't know what the end game is.

02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:49.900
[Amit Varma]: We don't know if there'll be more variants or whatever, when we look forward to the job

02:13:49.900 --> 02:13:54.780
[Amit Varma]: that the Indian economy has to do to get back on track, you know, what are the things which

02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:57.500
[Amit Varma]: for you are reasons to be hopeful?

02:13:57.500 --> 02:14:01.780
[Amit Varma]: And what are the things which for you are reasons to despair?

02:14:01.780 --> 02:14:07.700
[Guest]: So I'm hopeful that now that we've allowed, we're not stopping people from getting the

02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:13.900
[Guest]: vaccine, whether it's individuals, private hospitals, companies, wherever, there will

02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:19.260
[Guest]: be a lot of energy that will be devoted to solving this issue, we'll get better at it.

02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:23.620
[Guest]: So I'm hoping that once one is able to get them and those negotiations will also work.

02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:28.300
[Guest]: So I'm hoping that even if things will get a little worse now, but that they will get

02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:29.520
[Guest]: better soon.

02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:32.380
[Guest]: So that certainly makes me optimistic.

02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:37.980
[Guest]: But in terms of how soon, what worries me is how soon will we be able to get back on

02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:38.980
[Guest]: track?

02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:43.940
[Guest]: How soon will the companies who, you know, eventually we give them a moratorium, but

02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:49.660
[Guest]: moratoriums can't continue forever after all, banks are paying interest to us, to those

02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:51.540
[Guest]: who have deposited money, to depositors.

02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:57.780
[Guest]: So moratoriums will go away, people will have to pay back their loans, many loans will,

02:14:57.780 --> 02:15:02.900
[Guest]: many companies have, you know, small businesses anyway, don't get too much.

02:15:02.900 --> 02:15:09.420
[Guest]: But when they, whatever they have, this has been a very, very bad time for small companies.

02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:16.380
[Guest]: So how many people will be able to get back on their feet, find work, find income, make,

02:15:16.380 --> 02:15:19.500
[Guest]: you know, make some money, be able to sustain themselves?

02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:20.980
[Guest]: That worries me.

02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:21.980
[Amit Varma]: Right.

02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:27.020
[Amit Varma]: So the penultimate question now, and I'll take you back to the young 19 year old Ila,

02:15:27.020 --> 02:15:29.500
[Amit Varma]: who's standing up and saying, no, we need roads.

02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:34.060
[Amit Varma]: If you were to, with all this life experience and hindsight, if you were to speak to that

02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:38.260
[Amit Varma]: young girl for a moment and give her some advice or tell her things she may not know

02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:42.100
[Amit Varma]: yet, but which would be useful for her to know in advance, what would you say?

02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:45.100
[Guest]: What advice would you give her?

02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:49.060
[Guest]: India is a very, very complex, very, very complex nation.

02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:52.940
[Guest]: Don't spend your initial years only studying economics.

02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:59.900
[Guest]: Study a lot more, study more subjects, study sociology, politics, history, and you'll do

02:15:59.900 --> 02:16:03.540
[Guest]: the same things better and make less mistakes.

02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:06.260
[Guest]: So do you wish you'd done all of those things?

02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:07.260
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:08.260
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:12.780
[Amit Varma]: And now the final question, it's kind of a meme on the show that my guests have to recommend

02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:16.900
[Amit Varma]: books which have either sort of changed the way they look at the world or influence them

02:16:16.900 --> 02:16:20.660
[Amit Varma]: greatly or even something they've read recently and they want to share with everyone.

02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:24.260
[Amit Varma]: These don't necessarily have to be books on your subject or economics or whatever, but

02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:28.260
[Amit Varma]: just what are the most memorable books for you which have had an impact on you or that

02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:33.300
[Amit Varma]: you would want to share just out of the sheer joy of reading them?

02:16:33.300 --> 02:16:38.580
[Guest]: So Seeing Like a State would be something that I'd like to, yeah, by James Scott is

02:16:38.580 --> 02:16:40.580
[Guest]: something that I'd like to share.

02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:48.900
[Guest]: There are books that I've read over the years that the books in themselves were not like

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:58.500
[Guest]: very, very brilliant, but putting them all, they add up to a whole worldview, you know,

02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:08.300
[Guest]: so whether you read Milton Friedman or whether you read what PJ Roark, however you pronounce

02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:09.300
[Guest]: that.

02:17:09.300 --> 02:17:16.820
[Guest]: So, you know, they all helped in helping me think, of course, the most recent book by

02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:23.100
[Amit Varma]: Kilkaran Shah is my latest, is our latest favorite.

02:17:23.100 --> 02:17:26.580
[Guest]: So with that, I guess that's the latest.

02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:27.580
[Amit Varma]: All right.

02:17:27.580 --> 02:17:29.620
[Amit Varma]: Ela, thank you so much for your time and your insights.
