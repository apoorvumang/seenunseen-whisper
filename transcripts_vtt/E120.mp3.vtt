00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Do u have a right to interfere and use force to stop the man with the stick?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Any reasonable person would argue that you do

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
[Amit Varma]: You have both the right to defend yourself, as well as others who are at the receiving end of violence

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
[Amit Varma]: Such as that bleeding defenceless kid

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
[Amit Varma]: You might have doubts about practicality of it

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
[Amit Varma]: The gunda could have fellow gunda's around and you could get beaten up yourself

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
[Amit Varma]: So you may choose not to interfere

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
[Amit Varma]: But there is no doubt about the morality of it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
[Amit Varma]: It is right for you to intervene

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, here's a follow up question

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
[Unknown]: Economics, Politics and Behavioral Science

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
[Amit Varma]: The political scientist A.O. Hirschman

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
[Amit Varma]: once said that citizens of democracies

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
[Amit Varma]: have three ways to respond to injustice

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
[Amit Varma]: by the state. We may leave,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
[Amit Varma]: complain or comply.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
[Amit Varma]: Well, the philosopher Jason Brennan argues

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
[Amit Varma]: that there is a fourth option, to resist.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
[Amit Varma]: His latest book,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
[Amit Varma]: When All Else Fails, argues

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
[Amit Varma]: that our right to self-defense and to

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
[Amit Varma]: defend others, holds even

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
[Amit Varma]: when it is the state that is the culprit.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
[Amit Varma]: There should be no special privileges

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
[Amit Varma]: granted to the state. This is a powerful

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
[Amit Varma]: and thought provoking book and Jason

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
[Amit Varma]: agreed to come on my podcast to chat with me

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
[Amit Varma]: about it in March. But before

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
[Amit Varma]: I cut to our conversation, let's take a

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
[Amit Varma]: quick commercial break.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
[Amit Varma]: is brought to you by Storytel. Storytel

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Jason, welcome to the scene and the unseen. Thanks for having

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
[Amit Varma]: me. Jason, before we start

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
[Amit Varma]: talking about your book When All Else Fails, tell me

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
[Amit Varma]: a little bit about your journey

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
[Amit Varma]: as a philosopher. Like, you know, very few

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
[Amit Varma]: young people get drawn to philosophy

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
[Amit Varma]: calling per se. So, how did

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
[Amit Varma]: you sort of fall into philosophy?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
[Guest]: I can actually tell you the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
[Guest]: exact time when I realized

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
[Guest]: I wanted to become a professional philosopher.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
[Guest]: It was, I think, May 2nd

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
[Guest]: in the year 2000. I was

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
[Guest]: an undergraduate and at the time I was majoring in

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
[Guest]: a couple other fields and I knew I had to take

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
[Guest]: a semester off, or at least a semester off

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
[Guest]: from college to earn more money to finish.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
[Guest]: So, I was packing up my

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
[Guest]: room in my fraternity house

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
[Guest]: and as I'm packing up my books, I realized

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
[Guest]: I have all these philosophy books, even

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
[Guest]: though I'd only taken two philosophy classes

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
[Guest]: and I'd been majoring in other things.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
[Guest]: So, on just a whim, I just was

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
[Guest]: curious, what does it take to actually become a philosophy

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
[Guest]: professor? So, I googled it

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
[Guest]: and I realized that you get to get a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
[Guest]: PhD for free. In fact, they pay you

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
[Guest]: to go, which means that I could

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
[Guest]: do it. I would be able to afford to do it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
[Guest]: And so, I decided at that moment that if I didn't

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
[Guest]: manage to go back to college, I would switch to

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
[Guest]: philosophy and try to become a professional

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
[Guest]: philosopher. And I guess it worked

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
[Amit Varma]: out. And who were the sort of

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
[Amit Varma]: thinkers or philosophers who

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
[Amit Varma]: inspired you or you looked up to at that time?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
[Guest]: There were

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
[Guest]: a number of different people. I liked David Hume,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
[Guest]: I liked John Stuart Mill.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
[Guest]: I tend to like the kind of consequentialist thinkers,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
[Guest]: Adam Smith,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
[Guest]: sort of the Scottish Enlightenment thinkers.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
[Guest]: I liked Robert Nozick.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
[Guest]: There were a couple, like Thomas Nagel,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
[Guest]: I was a big fan of his books,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
[Guest]: especially the introductory books, which would

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
[Guest]: talk about high-level concepts in a plain and

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
[Guest]: simple way. So, I was reading a lot of that

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of stuff. And a philosopher

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
[Amit Varma]: I had on the show a few months ago

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
[Amit Varma]: told me that one of the things about being

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
[Amit Varma]: a philosopher was that you kept changing

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
[Amit Varma]: your mind throughout your life.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
[Amit Varma]: What are the important questions on which you've

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
[Guest]: changed your mind in the last 20 years?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
[Guest]: Sure, a couple things.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
[Guest]: There are some questions about the

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
[Guest]: nature of the mind and things where

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
[Guest]: I had one view and I've had others.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
[Guest]: I think when I entered grad school, I was very

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
[Guest]: impressed by virtue ethics

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
[Guest]: as a theory. I thought maybe it was going to solve

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
[Guest]: all the problems that deontology and

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
[Guest]: consequentialism had. And then the more

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
[Guest]: I read, the more it seemed to be

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
[Guest]: not fulfilling its promises.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
[Guest]: So, I sort of switched back to thinking

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
[Guest]: other kinds of views.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
[Guest]: I think I've become

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
[Guest]: less hard-line about

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
[Guest]: rights and starting to think that when we

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
[Guest]: come to evaluate institutions, we have to

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
[Guest]: always think about them in partially

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
[Guest]: consequentialist terms and about their functionality.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
[Guest]: You can't simply talk

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
[Guest]: about what

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
[Guest]: rights people have without any concern about

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
[Guest]: what the world would look like if those rights were

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
[Guest]: respected. I think

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
[Guest]: early on I thought that, I agreed

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
[Guest]: with F.A. Hayek that the concept of social justice

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
[Guest]: was just nonsensical,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
[Guest]: that it didn't actually make sense to talk about social

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
[Guest]: justice, that justice applied to

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
[Guest]: intentional human action but not to

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
[Guest]: unintentional results.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
[Guest]: I now think that there's a way of

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
[Guest]: resolving that problem and I think that

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
[Guest]: a concern for something that could reasonably

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
[Guest]: be called social justice is a test

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
[Guest]: of whether certain institutions

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
[Guest]: are valuable or not. So, those are a few

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
[Guest]: things. There's other stuff as well but a lot of it's

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
[Guest]: maybe more minor.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Although When All Else Fails isn't really a

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
[Amit Varma]: libertarian book, you've written a bunch of other very

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
[Amit Varma]: interesting libertarian books before this.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, did you sort of, were you a libertarian

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
[Amit Varma]: from before

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
[Amit Varma]: you got interested in philosophy or

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
[Amit Varma]: was it after you

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
[Amit Varma]: turned to philosophy and started asking

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
[Amit Varma]: yourself those big questions that you came to it?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
[Guest]: I think it was definitely before.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
[Guest]: It was because of economics.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
[Guest]: Even though it's not the case that the average

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
[Guest]: economist is libertarian, they're not. They're

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
[Guest]: still, in some

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
[Guest]: sense, pretty libertarian compared to most

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
[Guest]: people. They favor

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
[Guest]: markets. There's a

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
[Guest]: debate about exactly how much government intervention

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
[Guest]: there should be into markets and a lot of that comes

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
[Guest]: down to the question of comparing

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
[Guest]: market failure to government failure.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
[Guest]: So, for me, I think it was the economics

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
[Guest]: perspective that made me think that a lot

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
[Guest]: of institutions that the average person

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
[Guest]: disparages turn out to work pretty well

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
[Guest]: and a lot of the things that they offer as solutions tend

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
[Guest]: to backfire.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
[Guest]: That said, I know I'm seen as a libertarian

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
[Guest]: philosopher, but aside from the book

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
[Guest]: Libertarianism and What Everyone Needs to Know,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
[Guest]: I really don't regard my other stuff

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
[Guest]: as libertarian.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
[Guest]: People will often read, like say I have this book called Against

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
[Guest]: Democracy, which made a big splash a couple

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
[Guest]: years ago, and people often read that as a

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
[Guest]: libertarian critique of democratic politics.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
[Guest]: I remember I was giving a presentation

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
[Guest]: on this and I joked with one person after he said

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
[Guest]: well, unbeknownst to you, I gave you the

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
[Guest]: socialist version of the argument.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
[Guest]: That's the copy you have.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
[Guest]: I think many times I'm making arguments

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
[Guest]: which, if you're libertarian minded, you're

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
[Guest]: going to be much more sympathetic to than

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
[Guest]: some other people, but I never

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
[Guest]: rarely, I think, rely upon libertarian

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
[Guest]: premises or the truth of libertarianism

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
[Guest]: to get to the conclusions I'm arguing for.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
[Guest]: I think that's true of this book too,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
[Guest]: When All Else Fails. If you're a libertarian,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
[Guest]: you're much more inclined to agree with this than

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
[Guest]: the average person, but it's not

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
[Amit Varma]: a libertarian book per se.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
[Amit Varma]: And is the label a bit of a problem in

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
[Amit Varma]: being taken seriously in the discourse?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, I'm known as a bit of a libertarian

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
[Amit Varma]: here in India, and the label

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
[Amit Varma]: just follows you everywhere, and sometimes you get

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
[Amit Varma]: the sense that there are people who just stop

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
[Amit Varma]: listening to what you're saying, simply because

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
[Amit Varma]: they attach the word libertarian to it, and they aren't

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
[Amit Varma]: really looking at arguments

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
[Amit Varma]: on their own merit.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Which is, of course, what all of our discourse has become,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
[Amit Varma]: but is that something you felt

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
[Guest]: that particular label?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
[Guest]: I think that's true. I don't want to overstate it,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
[Guest]: but there certainly is a kind of political prejudice

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
[Guest]: that pervades the academy.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
[Guest]: And it's not simply against libertarians.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
[Guest]: In, say, philosophy, if you write a Marxist

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
[Guest]: book, you're going to be...

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
[Guest]: Given that the average philosopher is kind of a moderate

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
[Guest]: left liberal, if you write a book

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
[Guest]: defending something from a Marxist point of view,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
[Guest]: they're going to be prejudiced against it and less inclined

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
[Guest]: to take you seriously.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
[Guest]: I think a lot of it... There is evidence

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
[Guest]: of conscious bias against

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
[Guest]: people with alternative political points of view.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
[Guest]: There's a lot of research demonstrating that this exists.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
[Guest]: And, in fact, that it exists within the academy.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
[Guest]: But I think a lot of it is actually

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
[Guest]: unconscious.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
[Guest]: Suppose

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
[Guest]: the average journal has, say,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
[Guest]: a number of editors who are kind of

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
[Guest]: moderately left liberal, and you write a paper

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
[Guest]: that coheres with their point of view,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
[Guest]: that says the kind of thing that they're inclined to believe.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
[Guest]: Well, then when they read it, they're more likely

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
[Guest]: to think the question you're asking is interesting.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
[Guest]: They're more likely to grant you some of your premises.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
[Guest]: When you have people who...

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
[Guest]: When they read a paper that's critiquing the stuff that they believe,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
[Guest]: they're a little bit more inclined to

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
[Guest]: send it to more negative reviewers,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
[Guest]: or to dismiss it or think it's uninteresting,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
[Guest]: or to not grant you some of your premises.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
[Guest]: So, I think, whenever you're

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
[Guest]: outside the mainstream, you have

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
[Guest]: additional challenges to getting your stuff published.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
[Guest]: On the other hand, the one

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
[Guest]: virtue that philosophy has compared

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
[Guest]: to some other fields, like, say, English,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
[Guest]: which is just a mess,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
[Guest]: intellectually speaking, here in the U.S.,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
[Guest]: there is

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
[Guest]: at least a taste for the avant-garde

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
[Guest]: and a desire to see papers

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
[Guest]: which critique things that everyone believes.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
[Guest]: Philosophy is the kind of field where if you write a paper

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
[Guest]: that says, you don't really have

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
[Guest]: hands, it's an illusion, people are like,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
[Guest]: well, that was a clever argument.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
[Guest]: You have that working for you to some degree

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
[Guest]: if you're defending non-mainstream views.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about the book now.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
[Amit Varma]: One of the main premises of your book

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
[Amit Varma]: takes off from the A.O. Hirschman quote

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
[Amit Varma]: where he says that there are only three

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
[Amit Varma]: possible responses to injustice or wrongdoings

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
[Amit Varma]: by governments. We may leave, complain or comply.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
[Amit Varma]: And your central argument of the book

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
[Amit Varma]: is that there is a fourth option

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
[Amit Varma]: and that is the option to resist, and we may

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
[Amit Varma]: even have a moral duty to do so.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
[Amit Varma]: When did you start thinking

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
[Amit Varma]: about it in these terms?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know, for us in

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
[Amit Varma]: India, I often say that India's biggest religion

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
[Amit Varma]: is not Hinduism, it's the religion of government

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
[Amit Varma]: because you automatically place

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
[Amit Varma]: government on this special high

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
[Amit Varma]: moral plane and look to them for

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
[Amit Varma]: solutions to everything, and the thought

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
[Amit Varma]: of resistance is

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
[Amit Varma]: so counterintuitive.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
[Amit Varma]: How did you get drawn to these particular

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
[Guest]: arguments?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
[Guest]: Yeah, good question. I think, I've always been

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
[Guest]: interested in the background question of

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
[Guest]: whether government has authority, whether

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
[Guest]: we should put government on a higher moral

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
[Guest]: level, and so on. But the particular question

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
[Guest]: of resistance was a response, I think, to the

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
[Guest]: problems of police violence in the United States.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
[Guest]: You know, the US,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
[Guest]: you may not know the statistics, but the US has

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
[Guest]: an unusually violent police force

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
[Guest]: compared to other liberal democratic

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
[Guest]: countries. Granted,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
[Guest]: we're larger than Germany is, but

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
[Guest]: US police officers kill more people

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
[Guest]: per year than German cops fire

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
[Guest]: bullets, right? So that's

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
[Guest]: telling you something, right? They might fire

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
[Guest]: in a given year, outside of the firing range,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
[Guest]: that is, like actually on the streets fire

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
[Guest]: something like 60 bullets per year in the entire

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
[Guest]: country of Germany. And in the US,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
[Guest]: we, on average, we're

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
[Guest]: killing about a thousand criminals per year with

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
[Guest]: police officers, and that can't be

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
[Guest]: explained entirely by us

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
[Guest]: having a higher crime rate. Part of it is a higher

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
[Guest]: crime rate, but it's not, that's not enough to explain it.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
[Guest]: So we have this very militaristic

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
[Guest]: and violent police force,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
[Guest]: and then thanks to the preponderance of

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
[Guest]: cameras, now people

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
[Guest]: are constantly filming the kinds of things the police

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
[Guest]: are doing, and you can get on, like,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
[Guest]: you can go online and weekly,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
[Guest]: I mean, literally weekly, find an

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
[Guest]: egregious example of police malfeasance

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
[Guest]: where someone will be arrested for

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
[Guest]: no particularly good reason, and once they have

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
[Guest]: been arrested and proven innocent and

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
[Guest]: prone and in prostrate, they'll

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
[Guest]: just shoot him, like basically execute

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
[Guest]: a person, or use

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
[Guest]: violence in a case where it wouldn't make sense to use any violence

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
[Guest]: at all. So you have,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
[Guest]: this was going along, I started thinking about,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
[Guest]: well, what would be the appropriate response to this

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
[Guest]: situation? Not necessarily strategically,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
[Guest]: but I just was wondering, if you saw a

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
[Guest]: police officer doing this kind of stuff,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
[Guest]: would you be allowed to shoot him, to stop him?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
[Guest]: And, like, morally speaking,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
[Guest]: would it be permissible? Not would it be

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
[Guest]: probably wouldn't be. If you shoot a police,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
[Guest]: there was a guy named Eric Garner, and

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
[Guest]: police officers just choked him to death

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
[Guest]: for selling cigarettes on the streets.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
[Guest]: He didn't need to do that. They used excessive

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
[Guest]: violence against him. If you

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
[Guest]: saw police officers doing that, could you

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
[Guest]: shoot them? They would probably send a SWAT team

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
[Guest]: to come kill you if you did, so I wouldn't recommend doing it,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
[Guest]: but would it be permissible to? And then

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
[Guest]: once I started thinking about that, I started thinking about

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
[Guest]: other kinds of government malfeasance.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
[Guest]: If the US government's planning

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
[Guest]: to engage in a drone strike against a

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
[Guest]: target that's mostly made up of innocent people,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
[Guest]: if it's spying on us,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
[Guest]: if it's doing other kinds of bad behaviors,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
[Guest]: what sorts of resistance are morally

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
[Guest]: permissible? And then the book kind of, I wrote

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
[Guest]: an article about it, and I even

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
[Guest]: wrote an article about lying to

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
[Guest]: voters. So,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
[Guest]: President Obama was accused of lying to

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
[Guest]: Ohio voters about NAFTA.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
[Guest]: There's a scene where, it's not really clear whether

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
[Guest]: this happened or not, I've been trying to verify it,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
[Guest]: it's not clear, but supposedly he's in Ohio

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
[Guest]: saying, I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
[Guest]: and get rid of free trade, and then as he's doing

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
[Guest]: that, his advisor, the Chicago

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
[Guest]: economist, Austin Goolsbee, is

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
[Guest]: in Canada saying, no, no, he doesn't really

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
[Guest]: mean that, we're just saying that because voters are stupid,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
[Guest]: but we're not really going to do that. And then when

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
[Guest]: people heard that, they were outraged, and my reaction

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
[Guest]: was, oh, that's a sensible thing to do,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
[Guest]: like, why should, if Ohio voters

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
[Guest]: are so stupid and they're going to make these bad choices,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
[Guest]: like, it's good that the president lies to them

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
[Guest]: to protect me and my children from these bad

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
[Guest]: voters. So I wrote a paper basically

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
[Guest]: defending that kind of behavior,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
[Amit Varma]: and then it turned into the book.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, your last chapter, kind of towards the end of the book,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
[Amit Varma]: you deal with the whole ethic of lying to

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
[Amit Varma]: voters and all, since you brought it up, a question

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
[Amit Varma]: I

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
[Amit Varma]: had regarding that is that

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
[Amit Varma]: isn't it, for democracy to function,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
[Amit Varma]: shouldn't it be normatively

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
[Amit Varma]: desirable to not lie to voters?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
[Amit Varma]: I buy your argument that sometimes voters are

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
[Amit Varma]: stupid, you might have bigoted voters

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
[Amit Varma]: who want war with the neighboring country, and you lie

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
[Amit Varma]: to them, and you come to power, and you do the good things,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
[Amit Varma]: and blah, blah, blah, but there is

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
[Amit Varma]: a danger there that, A, if you are

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
[Amit Varma]: the politician doing that, you are just rationalizing

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
[Amit Varma]: your lying, and beyond the

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
[Amit Varma]: point what your final beliefs are don't really

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
[Amit Varma]: matter, but also beyond that,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
[Amit Varma]: if democracy is to function,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
[Amit Varma]: shouldn't it be considered wrong

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
[Amit Varma]: to lie to voters regardless of what the reasons

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
[Guest]: for that might be?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
[Guest]: There's a couple questions packed in there. So one is

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
[Guest]: like, how should democracy actually function?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
[Guest]: And what should happen is

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
[Guest]: people should have a good sense of what

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
[Guest]: their interests are, and also have a concern for other

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
[Guest]: people's interests. They should form

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
[Guest]: beliefs about policy, and which politicians

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
[Guest]: to support, based upon

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
[Guest]: evidence, and

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
[Guest]: the best available social scientific

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
[Guest]: and scientific evidence. And then they

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
[Guest]: should pick policies on a basis, and vote for people

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
[Guest]: who they think, reasonably think,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
[Guest]: in light of that evidence, will do the best job implementing

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
[Guest]: the policies that support their ends.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
[Guest]: And when everybody votes that way, we'll get

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
[Guest]: some kind of compromise position, which promotes

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
[Guest]: everyone's interest. So that's

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
[Guest]: the normative model of democracy that most people

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
[Guest]: work with. So the problem with that

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
[Guest]: is, none of that's true.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
[Guest]: None of it is true. Very few

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
[Guest]: voters vote ideologically. Very few

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
[Guest]: voters have strong opinions about

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
[Guest]: politics. Most of the time

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
[Guest]: when voters support a particular political party,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
[Guest]: they do so on

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
[Guest]: non-cognitive grounds. So in the same way

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
[Guest]: that I support the Boston Red Sox

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
[Guest]: as a baseball team, not because I

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
[Guest]: rationally chose them, but because

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
[Guest]: I happen to grow up in the Boston area,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
[Guest]: you find that voters

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
[Guest]: typically support a party simply because

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
[Guest]: that's what people like them do.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
[Guest]: And the fact that people like them do it has nothing

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
[Guest]: to do with the party's tendency to support

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
[Guest]: their interests. So

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
[Guest]: Irish people,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
[Guest]: Boston Irish people tend to vote for the Democrats

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
[Guest]: in the United States, not because the Democrats

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
[Guest]: are especially good for Boston Irish people,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
[Guest]: or because they support their ideology,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
[Guest]: but just by historical

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
[Guest]: circumstance. Voters are ignorant,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
[Guest]: they're irrational, they're not voting on the basis of

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
[Guest]: information. So you're already

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
[Guest]: missing that piece of it, and then politicians

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
[Guest]: can make certain bad choices in light of that.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
[Guest]: So I think when we're asking

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
[Guest]: what are the ethics of democracy,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
[Guest]: we have to ask how should we

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
[Guest]: respond to democracy as it is,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
[Guest]: not what would be the ethical obligations

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
[Guest]: if democracy worked the way it's supposed to.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
[Guest]: Now you're right about one thing.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
[Guest]: In this book I say, I'm trying to give

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
[Guest]: conditions under which it's permissible

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
[Guest]: to lie, to deceive, to sabotage,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
[Guest]: to destroy, or even to use violence

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
[Guest]: against other people. And there's

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
[Guest]: a danger with any of these principles, which is that

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
[Guest]: people might misapply them.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
[Guest]: They might not understand when to apply them, and they might

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
[Guest]: even give themselves permission to use it

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
[Guest]: the wrong way.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
[Guest]: And that's basically true of ethics in general.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
[Guest]: So if I tell you, if somebody

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
[Guest]: is beating you up, you're allowed to fight back.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
[Guest]: You're allowed to engage in self-defense.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
[Guest]: Just forget about government for a moment, forget about

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
[Guest]: democracy. Just say, on the schoolyard

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
[Guest]: if a kid attacks you, and it's necessary

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
[Guest]: to use violence to defend yourself,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
[Guest]: that's the truth about ethics.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
[Guest]: Once I tell that to a seven-year-old,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
[Guest]: he might very well convince himself

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
[Guest]: that when he's picking on somebody else, that it's actually

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
[Guest]: self-defense. When we tell governments,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
[Guest]: when we hand governments just war

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
[Guest]: theories, like forget about the work I'm doing,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
[Guest]: take the typical theory of just war

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
[Guest]: that, say, a philosopher would

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
[Guest]: defend, every theory of just war

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
[Guest]: says that violence can only be used

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
[Guest]: in self-defense. You hand that to

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
[Guest]: George W. Bush in 2003,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
[Guest]: and he's able to rationalize

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
[Guest]: to himself that attacking Iraq

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
[Guest]: counts as a form of self-defense.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
[Guest]: That's a problem with the people

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
[Guest]: and misapplying the theory, but it doesn't make

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
[Guest]: the theory wrong.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
[Guest]: There's one other thing I'd

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
[Guest]: add to that, which is, if you call

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
[Guest]: this objection the dangerous misapplication

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
[Guest]: objection, the idea that you have

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
[Guest]: to keep this theory quiet because people

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
[Guest]: might use it the wrong way, I think that applies

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
[Guest]: even more strongly to the

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
[Guest]: other side. If you look at the

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
[Guest]: psychology of what people are like,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
[Guest]: people are overly deferential

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
[Guest]: to authority. They have a tendency

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
[Guest]: to do whatever they're told to do. They don't

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
[Guest]: fight back. They don't resist.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
[Guest]: If a government comes to power and they

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
[Guest]: say, we're going to throw all Japanese people in

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
[Guest]: concentration camps, the typical person says,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
[Guest]: sure, no problem. If they say, we're going to

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
[Guest]: throw all Jewish people in concentration camps

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
[Guest]: and we need you to execute them, they

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
[Guest]: do it. If you put people in

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
[Guest]: the Milgram experiment, you take the average

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
[Guest]: person, put them in an

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
[Guest]: experiment, get a person in a white lab

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
[Guest]: coat to tell them to electrocute another person

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
[Guest]: to death, they'll do it. So if anything,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
[Guest]: I think the opposite side

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
[Guest]: is even more dangerous

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
[Guest]: than my side. We know people are overly

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
[Guest]: deferential to authority, so we have to be very

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
[Guest]: careful about telling them that they should

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
[Amit Varma]: respect authority.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
[Amit Varma]: You could also then argue that

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
[Amit Varma]: being deferential to authority is actually

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
[Amit Varma]: hardwired into us. And what you are

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
[Amit Varma]: asking is also an act of resistance

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
[Amit Varma]: against a hardwiring.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
[Guest]: I think there is evidence that

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
[Guest]: this tendency to defer to authority is

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
[Guest]: nearly universal. It does vary a bit

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
[Guest]: from culture to culture, but it's so prevalent

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
[Guest]: everywhere that it doesn't seem like it's merely

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
[Guest]: a cultural artifact. Maybe

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
[Guest]: there's some sort of evolutionary explanation for it

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
[Guest]: about going along with

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
[Amit Varma]: the group, why that happened.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll get to the premise of your book.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, your book essentially argues

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
[Amit Varma]: against what you call the special

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
[Amit Varma]: immunity thesis and argues for

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
[Amit Varma]: what you call the moral parity thesis.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Can you explain these for us?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
[Guest]: Sure. So the moral parity

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
[Guest]: thesis and the special immunity thesis are a question about

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
[Guest]: when can you use

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
[Guest]: defensive actions against government

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
[Guest]: agents. So defensive actions

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
[Guest]: mean things like deception,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
[Guest]: like lying, deception,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
[Guest]: sabotage, destruction, or

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
[Guest]: violence against another person.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
[Guest]: So normally these actions are

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
[Guest]: not permissible. I can't just go up and attack

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
[Guest]: a person. I'm not normally supposed to lie to

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
[Guest]: people. But you are allowed to use these

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
[Guest]: things in self-defense or defense of

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
[Guest]: others. And there's a whole theory about exactly

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
[Guest]: when this gets activated.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
[Guest]: So the special immunity

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
[Guest]: thesis is the thesis that it seems most

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
[Guest]: people believe. The special immunity thesis

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
[Guest]: says that the conditions under

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
[Guest]: which you can use defensive actions

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
[Guest]: against government agents who are acting

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
[Guest]: ex officio, like in

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
[Guest]: the capacity of their office,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
[Guest]: are much more stringent than

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
[Guest]: the conditions under which you can use self-defense

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
[Guest]: against me. The

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
[Guest]: moral parity thesis says, nope, they're one

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
[Guest]: and the same. The conditions under which you can use

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
[Guest]: defensive actions against government agents

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
[Guest]: are exactly the same as the conditions under

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
[Guest]: which you can use self-defense against me.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
[Guest]: So one is saying,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
[Guest]: the moral parity thesis says self-defense against

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
[Guest]: civilians and government agents is exactly

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
[Guest]: on par. They're governed by exactly the same

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
[Guest]: principles. You treat them exactly the same.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
[Guest]: And the special immunity thesis says

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
[Guest]: that government agents have

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
[Guest]: some sort of extra moral

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
[Guest]: permission and you have an obligation

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
[Guest]: to defer to them in ways where you can't

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
[Guest]: use self-defense against them or you can't defend

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
[Guest]: others against them, though if

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
[Guest]: a civilian were doing exactly the same thing,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
[Amit Varma]: you'd be allowed to intervene.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you've given a number of thought experiments

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
[Amit Varma]: in your book about all of these. I'll just

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
[Amit Varma]: read out a couple of them to sort of get your point

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
[Amit Varma]: across. One is

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
[Amit Varma]: called Shooter in the Park. A masked man emerges

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
[Amit Varma]: from a black van holding a rifle.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
[Amit Varma]: He starts shooting at children in a public park

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
[Amit Varma]: and a bystander has a gun.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
[Amit Varma]: She kills him before he kills any innocent

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
[Amit Varma]: children. And your other example

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
[Amit Varma]: is called Minivan Shooter.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
[Amit Varma]: A man witnesses a police officer stop

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
[Amit Varma]: a minivan with a female driver and three

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
[Amit Varma]: children in the back and sees that the driver

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
[Amit Varma]: has nothing in her hands and her hands are on the

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
[Amit Varma]: steering wheel. The police officer emerges

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
[Amit Varma]: from his car and starts shooting at the van's

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
[Amit Varma]: windows. Anne has a gun. She

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
[Amit Varma]: fires at the police officer before

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
[Amit Varma]: he shoots any of the children. Now, leaving

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
[Amit Varma]: questions of practicality aside, as you

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
[Amit Varma]: just pointed out that it would be impractical

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
[Amit Varma]: to shoot at the police officer because

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, you'd immediately have a special

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
[Amit Varma]: task force send after you. But

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
[Amit Varma]: your argument is that both

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
[Amit Varma]: these situations are identical

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
[Amit Varma]: and the fact that the guy with a gun is wearing

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
[Amit Varma]: a police uniform in the second

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
[Amit Varma]: instance doesn't change that. You have an

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
[Amit Varma]: equal right to defend

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
[Amit Varma]: the children against both people.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
[Guest]: Yeah, that's right. The claim is

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
[Guest]: that the moral parity thesis says

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
[Guest]: if you can use self-defense in the first case

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
[Guest]: with a civilian, you can use it in the second case

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
[Guest]: with a police officer. And the special

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
[Guest]: immunity thesis will say, no, there's some reason

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
[Guest]: why you can't use it against the police officer

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
[Guest]: but you can in the first case.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
[Guest]: And by the way, most of these cases

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
[Guest]: that you have in the book are based upon

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
[Guest]: real-life cases in the United States.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
[Guest]: Some of them I had to take out the reference

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
[Guest]: because we were worried about lawsuits.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
[Guest]: Even though almost all these cases

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
[Guest]: you can actually watch it happen

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
[Guest]: with a video. So the minivan shooter,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
[Guest]: there's a video of a police officer doing this

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
[Guest]: and shooting at the children.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
[Guest]: Nevertheless, because people dispute

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
[Guest]: the accusation, we just had to

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
[Guest]: take out some of the references

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
[Guest]: to real-life people.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
[Guest]: Similarly, I give an example of

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
[Guest]: the Rodney King

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
[Guest]: beating versus another beating.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
[Guest]: The first case is something like, one of your friends

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
[Guest]: is at a party and he gets to be drunk

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
[Guest]: and starts making a mess, and so people

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
[Guest]: subdue him. But then even after he's subdued

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
[Guest]: and he's no longer a danger to anybody,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
[Guest]: they're just mad at him, so they beat the hell out of him.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
[Guest]: And then I ask, if you saw

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
[Guest]: that happening, if you saw them just beating this man

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
[Guest]: senseless after they've

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
[Guest]: stopped him from being a danger, you probably think

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
[Guest]: it's permissible to intervene. We'll now make

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
[Guest]: it the same thing, but it's the Rodney King beating

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
[Guest]: in the United States, where he was drunk driving,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
[Guest]: drunk driving is dangerous, it was right to stop

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
[Guest]: him, but having stopped him, they

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
[Guest]: then just continually beat

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
[Guest]: him even after he's no longer any possible

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
[Guest]: threat to anybody. So my

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
[Guest]: question is, could you, like

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
[Guest]: suppose you're standing there and you see them doing this

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
[Guest]: and you could somehow intervene. You could fire

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
[Guest]: a couple shots at them to scare them, or you could

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
[Guest]: shoot them to stop them. Would it be permissible

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
[Guest]: to do so? And I think the answer is yes.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
[Guest]: Or another case involves drugs.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
[Guest]: If I, Jason Brennan, were to

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
[Guest]: decide that I don't think anyone should, like

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
[Guest]: I go to Colorado and I say

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
[Guest]: here in Colorado marijuana is legal,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
[Guest]: but I don't think people should smoke pot, so I'm

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
[Guest]: going to, anyone who has marijuana, I'm

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
[Guest]: going to kidnap you and put you in my basement for

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
[Guest]: 30 days, and I'm going to take $300

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
[Guest]: out of your bank account.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
[Guest]: You would think that that is permissible

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
[Guest]: to fight violently against me to stop

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
[Guest]: me from doing that. If the government says

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
[Guest]: the same thing, then people think they

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
[Guest]: have to defer to it. I don't think you do.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
[Amit Varma]: I think you can treat them the same.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
[Amit Varma]: And you've got an entire chapter

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
[Amit Varma]: on the right to self-defense and how

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
[Amit Varma]: it's been, how the common law is basically

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
[Amit Varma]: codified by

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
[Amit Varma]: how they arise out of our common sense

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
[Amit Varma]: moral intuitions. And that phrase struck me because

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
[Amit Varma]: it also struck me that while it is

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
[Amit Varma]: common sense moral intuition and therefore

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
[Amit Varma]: codified into law that we have a right to

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
[Amit Varma]: defend ourselves and others,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
[Amit Varma]: it is equally common sense

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
[Amit Varma]: moral intuition that there is a

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
[Amit Varma]: line that is drawn when someone

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
[Amit Varma]: in authority, authority again

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
[Amit Varma]: in court marks, and we'll come to that word later,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
[Amit Varma]: but if it's someone from the government or

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
[Amit Varma]: an officer of the law, why do you think

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
[Amit Varma]: that is the case? Why do you think that our

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
[Amit Varma]: moral intuitions, if it is the case,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
[Amit Varma]: why do you think that that's the way it is that

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
[Amit Varma]: our moral intuitions tend to draw

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
[Amit Varma]: that line and

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of tend to go with the

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
[Amit Varma]: special immunity thesis? Yeah, good.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
[Guest]: You know, a couple of things about that. One is,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
[Guest]: it's true that commonsensically

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
[Guest]: we think we have certain rights of self-defense,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
[Guest]: and then also commonsensically we tend to believe in

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
[Guest]: special immunity. So,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
[Guest]: one way I see what philosophy is doing is this,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
[Guest]: every person has

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
[Guest]: a number of moral beliefs, and these

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
[Guest]: moral beliefs are not consistent.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
[Guest]: Very few people have fully consistent moral

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
[Guest]: beliefs. So what philosophy is

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
[Guest]: often doing is saying to the reader,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
[Guest]: you think A, you also think B.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
[Guest]: You believe one thing, you also believe this other thing.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
[Guest]: These two things can't both

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
[Guest]: be true. You're calling attention

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
[Guest]: to conflicts in people's beliefs, and then you're

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
[Guest]: trying to say, so to resolve them, you're going to have to give

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
[Guest]: something up. Which of these beliefs is the one that you

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
[Guest]: should hold on to? So in a sense, what I'm doing

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
[Guest]: in the whole book is to say, you think

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
[Guest]: that self-defense is permissible under these circumstances,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
[Guest]: you also think that you should treat cops

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
[Guest]: and congresspeople differently.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
[Guest]: I'm going to show you there's a lot of tension

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
[Guest]: between these two things. Then I'm going to

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
[Guest]: look through every possible explanation,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
[Guest]: like philosophically

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
[Guest]: good explanation for treating cops

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
[Guest]: and congresspeople differently, and if none of them survive,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
[Guest]: then we should just, by default, go back to

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
[Guest]: thinking that they're not different, that we should treat them the same.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
[Guest]: That said,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
[Guest]: as far as the belief in authority, I think there's a few

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
[Guest]: things going here. One is that

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
[Guest]: we evolved to live in

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
[Guest]: small tribal bands of about 120

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
[Guest]: members or less, and

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
[Guest]: what was really important for our survival

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
[Guest]: through most of human history

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
[Guest]: was to be able to demonstrate intense

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
[Guest]: loyalty to your group.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
[Guest]: Your own survival depended upon

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
[Guest]: loyalty to your group and

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
[Guest]: enmity against your out-group.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
[Guest]: That often leads to conformist

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
[Guest]: behavior. Making sure

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
[Guest]: you believe the same things as others,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
[Guest]: you engage in certain kinds of expensive

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
[Guest]: rituals, that you belong to the same religion.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
[Guest]: These are expensive signaling

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
[Guest]: devices that prove your loyalty.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
[Guest]: I think we've been evolved to be somewhat conformist.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
[Guest]: Beyond that, we get

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
[Guest]: indoctrinated into conformity through

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
[Guest]: our entire childhood. Governments put

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
[Guest]: up very fancy-looking buildings with

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
[Guest]: fancy symbols. They wear fancy uniforms.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
[Guest]: Schooling is controlled by governments

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
[Guest]: and they tell you that you should obey the

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
[Guest]: government and do what it says.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
[Guest]: They sometimes misread

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
[Guest]: history in a way that makes you more in favor

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
[Guest]: of government. So I think we get a

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
[Guest]: combination of cultural indoctrination into

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
[Guest]: deference to authority, plus

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
[Guest]: there's probably some natural

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
[Guest]: tendency towards it anyways.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
[Amit Varma]: Now a large chunk of your book is, the approach

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
[Amit Varma]: you've taken in the book, is that you've taken

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
[Amit Varma]: a lot of the common and strongest

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
[Amit Varma]: arguments which would

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
[Amit Varma]: seem to support that governments have that

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
[Amit Varma]: special moral force field, as you called it, around

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
[Amit Varma]: them. Arguments for the special immunity

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
[Amit Varma]: thesis, and you break them down

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
[Amit Varma]: one by one. And the most

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
[Amit Varma]: interesting chapter I found for me

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
[Amit Varma]: was the one which dealt

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
[Amit Varma]: with the questions of the

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
[Amit Varma]: legitimacy of the state and the authority

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
[Amit Varma]: of the state, where you conclude

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
[Amit Varma]: that even if a government is

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
[Amit Varma]: legitimate, that doesn't necessarily

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
[Amit Varma]: give it authority over you.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
[Amit Varma]: So can you explain that and parse

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
[Guest]: those terms for me?

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
[Guest]: Sure. So these words are used differently

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
[Guest]: by different philosophers. To some degree,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
[Guest]: these are stipulations.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
[Guest]: Everyone agrees that what's

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
[Guest]: supposed to make government interesting is that it

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
[Guest]: has two special moral powers.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
[Guest]: And I'm going to call these moral powers legitimacy

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
[Guest]: and authority. If you don't like those words, you can use something else.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
[Guest]: Legitimacy refers

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
[Guest]: to a moral

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
[Guest]: permission to create and enforce

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
[Guest]: rules by fiat. So

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
[Guest]: governments can create a rule and they can use

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
[Guest]: violence and threats of violence to enforce

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
[Guest]: these rules over certain people within

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
[Guest]: a certain geographic area.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
[Guest]: And authority is another moral

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
[Guest]: power, which is supposed to be that when a government

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
[Guest]: creates these rules, it

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
[Guest]: also creates in you an obligation

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
[Guest]: to obey the rule.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
[Guest]: And what I want to note is that there's a question about whether

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
[Guest]: any governments are legitimate and whether

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
[Guest]: any are authoritative, but I also know that these are

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
[Guest]: independent powers.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
[Guest]: It's possible to be legitimate without authority,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
[Guest]: and it's possible to be authoritative without legitimacy,

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
[Guest]: at least conceptually speaking.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
[Guest]: So imagine, I don't think

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
[Guest]: pacifism is true, but for the sake of argument,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
[Guest]: imagine that pacifism is true.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
[Guest]: You're never allowed to use violence ever.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
[Guest]: You're never allowed to use coercion ever to get

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
[Guest]: people to do what you want. Then you can

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
[Guest]: still have a society where

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
[Guest]: let's say there's a kind of philosopher

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
[Guest]: queen and she issues orders

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
[Guest]: and suppose because she's all wise and all

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
[Guest]: knowing, when she issues an order, you should

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
[Guest]: follow it. She's telling you to do the right thing.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
[Guest]: In that society, she would have

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
[Guest]: authority, but because pacifism is

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
[Guest]: by hypothesis true, she's not allowed

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
[Guest]: to use any kind of coercion to enforce

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
[Guest]: her rules. So that would be a situation in which

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
[Guest]: she's authoritative but not legitimate.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
[Guest]: Now to imagine the question about legitimacy

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
[Guest]: without authority.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
[Guest]: When you think about a boxing match,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
[Guest]: if you and I were to have a fist fight like in a boxing

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
[Guest]: match, we've agreed that we're allowed to punch

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
[Guest]: each other, so we have permission to punch each other.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
[Guest]: But when I go to punch you, you don't

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
[Guest]: have any obligation to let me punch you.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
[Guest]: You're allowed to block and evade the strike.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
[Guest]: My punching would be legitimate but not

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
[Guest]: authoritative. Maybe governments are like

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
[Guest]: that too. Maybe it's permissible for governments

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
[Guest]: to create and enforce certain rules,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
[Guest]: but there's not a duty per se to

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
[Guest]: obey the law. And what's odd is that

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
[Guest]: when you look at the people

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
[Guest]: who are writing about government authority,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
[Guest]: it's pretty clear that philosophers

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
[Guest]: have spent the last 2,500 years

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
[Guest]: trying to come up with an answer

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
[Guest]: to the question of should you obey

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
[Guest]: the law. And all

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
[Guest]: of the arguments fail. They're all bad

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
[Guest]: arguments, like arguments based upon consent,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
[Guest]: arguments based on hypothetical consent,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
[Guest]: on other sorts of things. None of these really seem to

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
[Guest]: show you have an obligation to obey the law.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
[Guest]: So I think the most common position now

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
[Guest]: in philosophy might be what

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
[Guest]: John Simmons calls philosophical anarchism,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
[Guest]: which isn't really anarchist.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
[Guest]: It's a bad title, but it really means some

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
[Guest]: governments are legitimate, but none have authority.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
[Guest]: Maybe it's okay for the US

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
[Guest]: government to make certain rules,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
[Guest]: but I don't actually have to obey them.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
[Guest]: And also, one complication

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
[Guest]: here about obeying the law,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
[Guest]: we have to distinguish between obeying the law because

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
[Guest]: it's the law and obeying it

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
[Guest]: because of independent rules.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
[Guest]: So if I walk down the street

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
[Guest]: and I start saying to my neighbors,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
[Guest]: I, Jason Brennan, hereby order you

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
[Guest]: not to murder anyone,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
[Guest]: well, they would have an obligation not to murder

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
[Guest]: anyone, but they don't have an obligation to

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
[Guest]: avoid murdering people because I said so.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
[Guest]: It's just they have a pre-existing moral obligation.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
[Guest]: So for a government to have authority,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
[Guest]: it has to be able to create obligations

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
[Guest]: where there were none or create a new

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
[Guest]: ground for obligations where there wasn't one

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
[Guest]: before. It has to be, you have to

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
[Guest]: obey the law because it's the law,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
[Guest]: not because there's some independent moral obligation

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
[Amit Varma]: that happens to track.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Right, so essentially you'd say that, look, all

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
[Amit Varma]: reasonable democratic governments

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
[Amit Varma]: with a constitution in place and so on

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
[Amit Varma]: can be reasonably considered

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
[Amit Varma]: legitimate, but none have authority.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
[Amit Varma]: Are there any duties that a citizen

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
[Amit Varma]: has towards

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
[Amit Varma]: her government which wouldn't

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
[Amit Varma]: apply to duties against other people?

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, of course, we have, you could say that

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
[Amit Varma]: we have to respect the negative rights of everybody,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
[Amit Varma]: but are there any duties

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
[Amit Varma]: which we have towards government itself per se?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
[Guest]: Well, one thing about this is even though I'm

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
[Guest]: skeptical about there being any authority

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
[Guest]: whatsoever, I don't really

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
[Guest]: need that for my argument to go through

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
[Guest]: because some of the best

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
[Guest]: arguments for government authority, just they don't

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
[Guest]: get you very far in terms of this debate.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
[Guest]: So, for example, the philosopher H. L.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
[Guest]: A. Hart, a great philosopher of

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
[Guest]: law, he argued for something called the

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
[Guest]: fair play theory. The fair play theory says

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
[Guest]: that if there's some sort of public

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
[Guest]: good being created by your neighbors,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
[Guest]: then you have to do your part to

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
[Guest]: support it. Like, I don't know, roads

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
[Guest]: and maybe some sort of welfare system or

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
[Guest]: maybe some sort of schooling system or perhaps

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
[Guest]: national defense. Your neighbors

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
[Guest]: are putting up money to provide these things.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
[Guest]: You benefit tremendously from them. You'd rather

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
[Guest]: not pay because you'd rather get it for free,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
[Guest]: but you recognize that the value

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
[Guest]: you get from having them is higher than the cost

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
[Guest]: you do. He thinks under these sorts of

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
[Guest]: circumstances, you have an obligation to

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
[Guest]: do your part, right? Which,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
[Guest]: for the sake of argument, let's just grant him he's right

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
[Guest]: about that. If he's right about that, that implies

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
[Guest]: things that I should pay some

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
[Guest]: taxes. If I get called to jury duty,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
[Guest]: maybe I should be required to serve.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
[Guest]: Maybe under a genuine

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
[Guest]: national emergency,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
[Guest]: I should agree to allow myself

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
[Guest]: to be conscripted into the army. So,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
[Guest]: I could grant him all of that,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
[Guest]: but it doesn't get you to

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
[Guest]: defense of the cases where I think you

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
[Guest]: can use self-defense against government

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
[Guest]: because he'd have to say something like,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
[Guest]: well,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
[Guest]: basically, this is almost a quote from the book,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
[Guest]: it seems bizarre to say, you benefit from

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
[Guest]: some of the public goods the state supplies.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
[Guest]: In order to avoid unfairly

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
[Guest]: free-riding on the efforts of others to provide

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
[Guest]: those public goods, you must not only pay

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
[Guest]: your taxes and serve on jury duty,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
[Guest]: but you must allow the president to exterminate

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
[Guest]: and forcibly relocate Native

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
[Guest]: American tribes. You must let police

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
[Guest]: officers choke, subdue, and handcuff

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
[Guest]: men in ways that result in their deaths.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
[Guest]: You must allow Congress to wage war against

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
[Guest]: whomever it likes. You must allow the police

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
[Guest]: to arrest you for smoking pot or for selling

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
[Guest]: big gulps. The thing with all these

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
[Guest]: other cases, they have nothing to do with paying your

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
[Guest]: fair share, playing fair, or avoiding free-riding.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
[Guest]: They go far beyond what his argument

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
[Guest]: can prove. So, I could grant that

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
[Guest]: you have some basic obligations towards

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
[Guest]: government, towards your fellow citizens to maintain

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
[Guest]: a good government, but

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
[Guest]: the burden that the other side

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
[Guest]: has is they have to say, it's not only authoritative

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
[Guest]: for the government to tax you and to

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
[Guest]: pass a couple rules which genuinely

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
[Guest]: promote the public good, but the government

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
[Guest]: has the authority to have police officers

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
[Guest]: kill people who are subdued. The government

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
[Guest]: has the authority to take away your rights

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
[Guest]: over your body. The government has the authority

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
[Guest]: over you to wage war

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
[Guest]: against others or to spy on you and so on.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
[Guest]: And their arguments don't get anywhere

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
[Amit Varma]: near that. And you address

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
[Amit Varma]: some of the common arguments against

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
[Amit Varma]: the argument for authority, like the

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
[Amit Varma]: consent arguments, for example.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
[Amit Varma]: Can you briefly take us through the major

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
[Amit Varma]: arguments for

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
[Amit Varma]: arguing for government authority and what your

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
[Guest]: objections to them are? Sure. So,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
[Guest]: the argument that people get taught

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
[Guest]: in the US by, like, when you take

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
[Guest]: your 6th grade civics class, they tell you,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
[Guest]: well, the wonderful thing about democracy is that

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
[Guest]: it's a government by the consent of the people.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
[Guest]: The problem with that is that we know

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
[Guest]: that that's wrong, and we've known, we philosophers

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
[Guest]: have known that was wrong before there were any

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
[Guest]: of the major modern democracies. I mean, David

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
[Guest]: Hume refuted this before there was

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
[Guest]: a United States government.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
[Guest]: So, when you think about how consensual

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
[Guest]: transactions work, they have certain

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
[Guest]: features. Like, you have to have an

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
[Guest]: explicit agreement to do something.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
[Guest]: There has to be a

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
[Guest]: quid pro quo, a tit for tat.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
[Guest]: You have to provide one thing in exchange for the

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
[Guest]: others. And both sides have to

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
[Guest]: keep their end of the bargain. So, I like to

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
[Guest]: give examples using guitars. Like, I

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
[Guest]: go to a guitar center, a guitar store

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
[Guest]: chain in the United States, and I

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
[Guest]: go up to the salesperson, and I point to a guitar, and I

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
[Guest]: say, I will buy that guitar.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
[Guest]: It's the case that I wasn't forced

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
[Guest]: to buy the guitar, and I had a reasonable way

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
[Guest]: of opting out. It wasn't as though they were

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
[Guest]: threatening to kill my family or hurt me if I didn't

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
[Guest]: buy it. It's also the case that

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
[Guest]: had I said, I don't want that guitar, the

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
[Guest]: transaction would have never taken place.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
[Guest]: So, my active dissent stops the transaction

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
[Guest]: from taking place. And finally,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
[Guest]: when I give them the money, they have

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
[Guest]: to give me the guitar. So, those are the

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
[Guest]: conditions. Like, there has to be an actual

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
[Guest]: ceremony where consent takes place.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
[Guest]: I have to have a reasonable way of opting

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
[Guest]: out. Active dissent stops

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
[Guest]: the deal, and they have to do their part.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
[Guest]: When it comes to government, none of

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
[Guest]: these conditions are met. There's never

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
[Guest]: a point where I signify my consent

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
[Guest]: to government. It's not like when I turn

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
[Guest]: 18, and I fill out my secret service

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
[Guest]: – no, sorry, not my secret service – my selective

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
[Guest]: service card that I thereby consent to government.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
[Guest]: I am

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
[Guest]: forced to take their

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
[Guest]: services. I don't have a reasonable way of opting

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
[Guest]: out of them. They are threatening to hurt me

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
[Guest]: if I don't provide to them

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
[Guest]: taxes and other kinds of things.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
[Guest]: If I say to them something like, no, no, you

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
[Guest]: don't understand. I don't consent to this particular

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
[Guest]: law. I don't consent to this election.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
[Guest]: I don't consent to the government in general.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
[Guest]: They don't care. And finally,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
[Guest]: they don't actually even do a quid pro quo. In the

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
[Guest]: U.S., and this is true of other countries as well,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
[Guest]: the governments don't have an

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
[Guest]: active duty to protect you.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
[Guest]: They have a general obligation,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
[Guest]: legally speaking, to generally provide

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
[Guest]: for the public welfare, but they don't

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
[Guest]: have an obligation to protect you. So we have a

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
[Guest]: couple of famous Supreme Court cases in the U.S.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
[Guest]: that basically take the form of

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
[Guest]: a person calls the police and says

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
[Guest]: – this actually happened in Washington, D.C., where I

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
[Guest]: work – a woman calls the police and says,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
[Guest]: two men have broken into my

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
[Guest]: apartment. They're going to attack me. And the

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
[Guest]: police say, well, we're not coming to help you.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
[Guest]: We can't help you. They hurt her.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
[Guest]: They rape her, and they rape her roommate.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
[Guest]: She later sues the government and says,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
[Guest]: you didn't do your part. I'm paying

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
[Guest]: taxes and so on for you to protect me.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
[Guest]: You didn't protect me. It goes all the way

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
[Guest]: up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
[Guest]: says, no, they didn't have an obligation to protect

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
[Guest]: you. They just have a general obligation to protect

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
[Guest]: people in general. So some people then

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
[Guest]: say, well, okay, it's not explicit

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
[Guest]: consent. It's hypothetical

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
[Guest]: consent. It's tacit consent.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
[Guest]: But even then, it doesn't seem to work.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
[Guest]: Hypothetical consent is important

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
[Guest]: in things like,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
[Guest]: if you are brought to the emergency room

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
[Guest]: unconscious, and the doctors have to

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
[Guest]: decide whether to operate on you, then they

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
[Guest]: think something like, well,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
[Guest]: if you were conscious,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
[Guest]: we think you would agree. We don't have any evidence that you

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
[Guest]: wouldn't, so we're going to start operating

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
[Guest]: on you. But if you wake up and you say, no,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
[Guest]: I'm a Jehovah's Witness. I don't believe in

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
[Guest]: blood transfusion, then they're going to

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
[Guest]: stop. So active dissent kills

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
[Guest]: that. And people will say things like,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
[Guest]: well, like Socrates

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
[Guest]: in the, not the Apology,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
[Guest]: the Crito, is asked, well, why is he accepting

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
[Guest]: this punishment when he knows the punishment is unjust?

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
[Guest]: And his main argument is, I've tacitly

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
[Guest]: consented to agree to the rules

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
[Guest]: of government because I

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
[Guest]: could have moved, and I didn't.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
[Guest]: And I don't know whether that's a good argument for

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
[Guest]: Socrates in the year, you know, back in 300

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
[Guest]: BC, but it doesn't really seem

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
[Guest]: to apply now because here,

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
[Guest]: very few people have the right to move to another country.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
[Guest]: So even the fact that I stayed put

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
[Guest]: in the United States and didn't leave doesn't

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
[Guest]: really prove that I've agreed to abide

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
[Guest]: by their authority. I'm just kind of

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
[Guest]: stuck here. And I actually have more ability

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
[Guest]: to move to other countries than most other people. Most people

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
[Guest]: have no permissibility to move at all.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
[Guest]: They simply can't immigrate if they want to.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
[Guest]: David Hume made fun of this by saying,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
[Guest]: like, he's like, I want you to imagine that

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
[Guest]: you've been kidnapped

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
[Guest]: and you wake up and

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
[Guest]: you're on a ship in the middle of the ocean.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
[Guest]: And the ship captain says, alright,

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
[Guest]: here's the deal. I'm the captain of the ship. If you want to be

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
[Guest]: on the ship, you have to follow my

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
[Guest]: orders. But if you don't like it, you can

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
[Guest]: feel free to leave. And he points to the water

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
[Guest]: surrounding you. It's like, well,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
[Guest]: if you then decide to stay on the ship rather than

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
[Guest]: jump into the freezing water to get eaten

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
[Guest]: by sharks or drown, it's not

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
[Guest]: like you really consented. You didn't have any

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
[Amit Varma]: reasonable way of opting out of his rule.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
[Amit Varma]: And that sounds exactly like the social

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
[Amit Varma]: contract to me. I mean, whenever people invoke

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
[Amit Varma]: that, I just tell them I didn't sign any contract.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
[Amit Varma]: You've got a great line in your book which kind of sums us up.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Quote, our relationship to government

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
[Amit Varma]: is no more analogous

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
[Amit Varma]: to a consensual contract than a red

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
[Amit Varma]: elephant is analogous to the number three.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
[Guest]: Stop quote.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
[Guest]: That's right. Just completely irrelevant. It's not at

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
[Amit Varma]: all consensual. There's like nothing

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
[Amit Varma]: to it that's consensual. Yeah, yeah. And one

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
[Amit Varma]: of those rare sort of LOL moments in the

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
[Amit Varma]: book. So moving on

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
[Amit Varma]: to sort of other arguments, you know, so

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
[Amit Varma]: we're going to take a quick commercial break. And when we come

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
[Amit Varma]: back, I'm going to try

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
[Amit Varma]: and pose a couple of arguments to you. And let's see

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
[Amit Varma]: how that goes. Sure.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
[Unknown]: Hello, everybody. Welcome

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000

[Unknown]: of demonstrating a greater degree of trust

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
[Unknown]: in a client and agency relationship.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000

[Unknown]: series, Kota Factory. They give insights

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
[Unknown]: about the show and the inspirations of the

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
[Unknown]: writers and actors. On Echoes of India,

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
[Unknown]: Anirudh takes us on a tour through the ancient

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
[Unknown]: city of Ujjain, walking us through

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
[Unknown]: its sights and smells and introducing us to

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
[Unknown]: some of its eccentric people. And with

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
[Unknown]: that, let's move on with your shows.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Jason Brennan, the US

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
[Amit Varma]: philosopher about the ethics of

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
[Amit Varma]: resisting state injustice.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, one of the examples that

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of struck me from among

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
[Amit Varma]: the many interesting thought experiments you pose in your book,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll just read it out for the listeners.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
[Amit Varma]: Quote, Walker is precedent. He initiates

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
[Amit Varma]: what is clearly an unjust war,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
[Amit Varma]: though many people unreasonably believe it

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
[Amit Varma]: to be just. Under his command, the

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
[Amit Varma]: government kills tens of thousands of innocent

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
[Amit Varma]: civilians and soldiers in foreign

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
[Amit Varma]: countries. Thousands of domestic

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
[Amit Varma]: troops die in vain fighting

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Walker's wars. The war destroys massive

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
[Amit Varma]: amounts of property and wealth. Tens of

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
[Amit Varma]: thousands of civilians die from the war's fallout.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Walker now plans to initiate

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
[Amit Varma]: another unjust war of the same sort

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
[Amit Varma]: in another country. Anne tries

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
[Amit Varma]: to use peaceful means to stop the war,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
[Amit Varma]: but these fail. Anne intervenes.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
[Amit Varma]: She kills Walker with a sniper rifle.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
[Amit Varma]: As a result, this stops the next war

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
[Amit Varma]: since Walker's successor is less belligerent.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote. And, you know,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
[Amit Varma]: the point you seem to be making here

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
[Amit Varma]: is a fairly straightforward one that

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, Walker's bad policies

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
[Amit Varma]: are costing thousands of lives

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
[Amit Varma]: both of, you know, his own

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
[Amit Varma]: people and of people in other countries

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
[Amit Varma]: and it is Anne's

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
[Amit Varma]: moral duty and if not her duty

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
[Amit Varma]: she at least has the right to intervene

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
[Amit Varma]: and stop Walker and do whatever it takes.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
[Amit Varma]: So, my question sort of here

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
[Amit Varma]: is, I mean, this is again

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, the most common argument

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
[Amit Varma]: against consequentialism seems to be

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
[Amit Varma]: epistemic arguments that

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
[Amit Varma]: geopolitics is so deeply complex,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
[Amit Varma]: everything has such unintended

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
[Amit Varma]: consequences. How can

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Anne or even Walker for that matter

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
[Amit Varma]: possibly fathom how

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
[Amit Varma]: all the chips will eventually fall and

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, what will actually

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
[Amit Varma]: be the consequence of those actions?

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
[Guest]: Yeah, it's a good question

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
[Guest]: and there are some worries about this.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
[Guest]: So, let's break it down to a few

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
[Guest]: different things. So, one is

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
[Guest]: there might be reasons to defer to police

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
[Guest]: officers or to government

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
[Guest]: agents that are epistemic, not

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
[Guest]: because they have moral authority, but they

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
[Guest]: have epistemic authority. So, if I'm

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
[Guest]: crossing the street and I see two police

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
[Guest]: officers beating up somebody

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
[Guest]: and then I look and down the street

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
[Guest]: I see two random guys

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
[Guest]: the same age beating up a third person

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
[Guest]: I'm more likely to think that the

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
[Guest]: police officers are justified than

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
[Guest]: the random other people. I'm more likely to think that

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
[Guest]: when it's just civilians beating up another

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
[Guest]: civilian, it's a mugging. When police

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
[Guest]: officers doing it, they had some reason.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
[Guest]: Because, just because of things we know

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
[Guest]: about people's behavior,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
[Guest]: it's true that sometimes government agents

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
[Guest]: have more information than we do and in light of that

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
[Guest]: information, things will be justifiable

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
[Guest]: but we don't have access to that information.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
[Guest]: So, we do have to worry about that kind of stuff

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
[Guest]: and I have some things to say about that in the book.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
[Guest]: There's also some worries about

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
[Guest]: not knowing the consequences of what you

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
[Guest]: might do, though I think

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
[Guest]: that that generally helps with self-defense

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
[Guest]: rather than not. So,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
[Guest]: if you take the

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
[Guest]: canonical statement of the right of self-defense

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
[Guest]: or the right to defend others is

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
[Guest]: a person has the right to

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
[Guest]: defend himself against an aggressor

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
[Guest]: when he reasonably believes

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
[Guest]: that doing so is necessary to

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
[Guest]: stop the aggressor from severely

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
[Guest]: violating his rights or causing severe

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
[Guest]: harm. That's sort of the canonical

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
[Guest]: statement. The right to defend others is

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
[Guest]: the same thing. You just change it from self-defense

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
[Guest]: to defending others and there's questions

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
[Guest]: about exactly what the line is about

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
[Guest]: reasonable, but what's interesting about

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
[Guest]: case law and I think most people's

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
[Guest]: intuitions is that

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
[Guest]: uncertainty is supposed to fall upon

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
[Guest]: the aggressor, not upon the person who's

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
[Guest]: defending themselves. So, there's a nice case

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
[Guest]: like this in the U.S.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
[Guest]: There's one person, the aggressor

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
[Guest]: is mugging a second person.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
[Guest]: The aggressor is beating him up and the second

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
[Guest]: person is reasonably in fear of his life.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
[Guest]: The aggressor reaches into his pocket

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
[Guest]: and it looks like he's reaching for

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
[Guest]: a gun. It turns out that the person

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
[Guest]: who's being picked on also has a weapon.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
[Guest]: He takes out his weapon and he kills the first

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
[Guest]: person, the aggressor.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
[Guest]: But it turns out he's wrong. In fact, he's

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
[Guest]: actually reaching for cigarettes.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
[Guest]: I think this guy's going to shoot me. He's actually

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
[Guest]: just reaching for cigarettes. I pull out my gun and I shoot

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
[Guest]: him. It goes to court and they decide

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
[Guest]: it's justifiable homicide. They said,

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
[Guest]: in light of the violence being enacted against you,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
[Guest]: it was reasonable for you to think he was

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
[Guest]: going to get a weapon against you and

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
[Guest]: the harm should fall upon him,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
[Guest]: not on you. You're the one that's the victim.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
[Guest]: As the victim, you benefit

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
[Guest]: from uncertainty. It should not be that the aggressor

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
[Guest]: benefits from uncertainty.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
[Guest]: If you believe in moral parity, then

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
[Guest]: I think the same thing applies to government.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
[Guest]: It certainly could be the case

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
[Guest]: that the next time we have something like the Iraq

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
[Guest]: invasion, when the government says,

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
[Guest]: they really do have weapons of mass

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
[Guest]: destruction and if we don't invade them, it's going

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
[Guest]: to be dangerous for everybody. It's possible

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
[Guest]: that that's true, but I think

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
[Guest]: the dangers of the uncertainty have

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
[Guest]: to fall upon them, not upon us,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
[Guest]: not upon civilians.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
[Guest]: When you think about the

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
[Guest]: problem of uncertainty, this is one of the reasons

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
[Guest]: why I would be, practically speaking,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
[Guest]: a pacifist. My friend Brian Kaplan,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
[Guest]: he's an economist down the street from me,

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
[Guest]: he's not a pacifist in the sense of

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
[Guest]: believing violence is never justified.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
[Guest]: He says, as a matter of government policy,

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
[Guest]: it's a good default position

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
[Guest]: because wars almost never

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
[Guest]: work out the way they're intended to.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
[Guest]: It always ends up being more costly

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
[Guest]: than they expected. They kill lots of civilians

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
[Guest]: who they weren't supposed to kill.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
[Guest]: The dangers are much higher.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
[Guest]: There really are

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
[Guest]: net benefits to these wars.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
[Guest]: Even things like, take World War I.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
[Guest]: The United States intervenes in World War I.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
[Guest]: Maybe that's part of the reason

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
[Guest]: why

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
[Guest]: the Allies beat

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
[Guest]: the Central Powers.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
[Guest]: As a result of that, what happens?

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
[Guest]: We get Nazi Germany, we get

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
[Guest]: the Soviet Union, we have another massive

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
[Guest]: World War. It's not clear that this

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
[Guest]: intervention was on net positive.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
[Guest]: It might very well be the case

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
[Guest]: that had the US just stepped back and done nothing,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
[Guest]: the world would have been a much better place

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
[Guest]: with fewer authoritarian

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
[Guest]: governments and far fewer people dying.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
[Guest]: I think, yes, there's

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
[Guest]: questions about thinking of that. One other final

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
[Guest]: bit that I think, because I said this is really multiple

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
[Guest]: questions stuck together. Sometimes we have

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
[Guest]: to worry about what you might call the problem of

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
[Guest]: fallout. Fannie Kaplan

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
[Guest]: tried to assassinate Lenin

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
[Guest]: back in, I think the year was 1919

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
[Guest]: or 1921. Anyway,

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
[Guest]: she tries to assassinate Vladimir Lenin

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
[Guest]: early on in the Soviet regime.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
[Guest]: His reaction was to engage in a massive

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
[Guest]: terror purge and to murder something like

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
[Guest]: another million people.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
[Guest]: One question we have to ask is,

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
[Guest]: if you know that governments might respond

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000
[Guest]: badly to your threats, to your

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
[Guest]: attempts to stop them, does that

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
[Guest]: provide you with an obligation not to intervene?

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
[Guest]: I think that's really not special to

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
[Guest]: government. I think this is another case where it's parallel

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
[Guest]: to cases with civilians.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
[Guest]: If I'm bullying you on

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
[Guest]: the schoolyard and you fight back

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
[Guest]: and I credibly say to you,

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
[Guest]: if you fight back against me, you don't allow me to steal your

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
[Guest]: lunch money, well, I'm going to go beat up two other

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
[Guest]: people and take their lunch money. Do you have

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
[Guest]: an obligation to let me then beat you up?

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
[Amit Varma]: Or are you allowed to defend yourself?

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
[Amit Varma]: Right, so following on from the thought

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
[Amit Varma]: of uncertainty, you know, another

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
[Amit Varma]: question, and I'll come at it from a probabilistic

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
[Amit Varma]: point of view. Let's say that

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Walker is the president, in your hypothetical

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
[Amit Varma]: example, and he's planning to

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
[Amit Varma]: go to war. Now, Anne's

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
[Amit Varma]: certainty of whether this

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
[Amit Varma]: will be harmful or not can be anywhere between

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
[Amit Varma]: 0-100%. If it's 0, she

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
[Amit Varma]: does nothing, there's no case for her to do anything.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
[Amit Varma]: If it's 100 and millions of people will die

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
[Amit Varma]: if she's 100% sure, then she'll feel

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
[Amit Varma]: the obligation to stop him. But the truth

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
[Amit Varma]: is that in the real world, our knowledge is never

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
[Amit Varma]: 0 or 100. So the question is

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
[Amit Varma]: A, for Anne to actually

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
[Amit Varma]: intervene in that situation,

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
[Amit Varma]: where do you draw the line? How sure

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
[Amit Varma]: does her knowledge have to be and how do

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
[Amit Varma]: we account for the human biases

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
[Amit Varma]: that play into that situation? For example,

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
[Amit Varma]: the president could be Republican and

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
[Amit Varma]: she's from the Green Party, so

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
[Amit Varma]: those biases also come into it.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
[Amit Varma]: And as a follow-up to that, if you

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
[Amit Varma]: are thinking of defending

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
[Amit Varma]: yourself or others against

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
[Amit Varma]: either a civilian or

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
[Amit Varma]: an agent of the government, do the

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
[Amit Varma]: numbers shift? Should you assign

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
[Amit Varma]: a lower probability of

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
[Amit Varma]: certainty to the agent

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
[Amit Varma]: of the state because they could have

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
[Guest]: a legitimate reason? Yeah, these are

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
[Guest]: all good questions. I'd say the reasonable

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
[Guest]: person standard for self-defense,

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
[Guest]: I'd say it's more like a 50%.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
[Guest]: You think you're about

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
[Guest]: 50% certain that this is going to

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
[Guest]: cause some sort of severe rights

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
[Guest]: violation, then you can intervene.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
[Guest]: I think that's around the number. It doesn't have to be close

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
[Guest]: to 100. In terms of deference,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
[Guest]: I think it does make a difference whom you're

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
[Guest]: dealing with. So I trust

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
[Guest]: the Swedish government more than I trust the American

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
[Guest]: government, and I trust the American government

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
[Guest]: more than I trust the Indian government.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000
[Guest]: So when you told me early on that

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
[Guest]: there's a very strong culture of deference

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
[Guest]: to authority and a tendency to put government

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
[Guest]: up on a pedestal in India, I find that

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
[Guest]: surprising because when you look at things like

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000
[Guest]: Transparency International's

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
[Guest]: measurement of government corruption or

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
[Guest]: various measures of the degree

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
[Guest]: of rent-seeking, which is like special interest

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
[Guest]: lobbying, you tend to find that India has

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
[Guest]: lots of corruption and lots of special

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
[Guest]: interest rent-seeking.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
[Guest]: So depending on who your government is,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
[Guest]: and I'm not saying that to be anti-Indian,

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
[Guest]: I'm bashing the United States here

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
[Unknown]: too. I celebrate

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
[Guest]: Independence Day. For what it's worth,

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
[Guest]: I don't wave flags on Independence Day, so I'm

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000
[Guest]: not rah-rah-rah here. But it does

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000
[Guest]: make a difference, the government

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
[Guest]: in question. So if you're worried

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
[Guest]: about, say, Russian intervention, it's more reasonably

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
[Guest]: worried about Russian intervention than, say, Swedish

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
[Guest]: intervention, just because of the track record of that

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
[Guest]: government. But that's true of people too.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
[Guest]: If I found out

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
[Guest]: that my wife was beating somebody up,

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
[Guest]: I would think that, just given what her behavior

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
[Guest]: is like and what I know about her,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
[Guest]: it's much more likely that she had a

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
[Guest]: good reason to do that than, say,

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
[Guest]: some other people I know who I won't mention

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
[Guest]: who are just not very good people.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
[Guest]: Yeah, you're right. The other thing you have to think about is

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
[Guest]: your own biases.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
[Guest]: It's certainly true that when you look in the

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
[Guest]: U.S., at least, there's a nice book

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
[Guest]: on this called Party in the Streets by Fabio

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
[Guest]: Rojas, and I can't remember the name of his

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
[Guest]: co-author, but they looked at the

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
[Guest]: anti-war movement during

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
[Guest]: the Bush era, and they find that

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
[Guest]: the overall majority of these people who are

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
[Guest]: protesting during the Bush era are

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
[Guest]: not genuinely anti-war. They're just

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
[Guest]: anti-Bush. They're Democratic operatives

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
[Guest]: or they're part of the Democratic Party, and they

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
[Guest]: don't like what Bush is doing.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
[Guest]: Only a very small minority are

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
[Guest]: sincerely against the Iraq War.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
[Guest]: So, if Obama had

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
[Guest]: done the same thing, they would never have protested,

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
[Guest]: but the people who are sincerely against it would have.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
[Guest]: So, when we were making these decisions,

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
[Guest]: yeah, you have to be aware of your own biases, including

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
[Guest]: not only your bias to

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
[Guest]: not give people credit or to be against

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
[Guest]: them, but also your bias to defer to authority

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
[Guest]: too, which again, we're all...

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
[Guest]: If you know about the Milgram experiment, you know that the average

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
[Guest]: person will execute another person when

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
[Guest]: they're told to do so.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
[Guest]: These are all the things to take into account.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting when you talk about the

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
[Amit Varma]: threshold of 50% or the number

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
[Amit Varma]: could be anything, but I'd contend that

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
[Amit Varma]: before you act, before you

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
[Amit Varma]: decide, should I act in self-defense

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
[Amit Varma]: or the defense of others, and you decide

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
[Amit Varma]: that, okay, 50% is my threshold,

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
[Amit Varma]: that 50% is 50% only before

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
[Amit Varma]: you actually act. After you act, it's

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
[Amit Varma]: either 100 or 0, because you're going to rationalize

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
[Amit Varma]: what you did. If you act and you intervene,

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
[Amit Varma]: say, if Ann kills Walker, she's always

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
[Amit Varma]: going to say, I was 100% sure. And

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
[Amit Varma]: if she doesn't do anything, she'll say, hey,

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, not sure what can I do.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
[Amit Varma]: People don't think in

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
[Amit Varma]: probabilistic ways and think through

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000
[Amit Varma]: these things. I mean, if you...

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
[Amit Varma]: And this kind of brings me on to the next question

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, once we

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000
[Amit Varma]: agree that we need a sort

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
[Amit Varma]: of state, however minimal, but a state

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
[Amit Varma]: with a monopoly on violence to protect our

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
[Amit Varma]: rights, doesn't it automatically

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
[Amit Varma]: mean not that they get special immunity,

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
[Amit Varma]: but that the threshold against

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
[Amit Varma]: that government is

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
[Amit Varma]: slightly higher? Because otherwise

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
[Amit Varma]: if you give, if it is widely

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
[Amit Varma]: considered morally permissible to resist,

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
[Amit Varma]: then anyone with any random conspiracy

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
[Amit Varma]: theory or any kind of grievance

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
[Amit Varma]: can rationalize that to do

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
[Amit Varma]: absolutely anything. So to get

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
[Amit Varma]: society

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
[Amit Varma]: running in an orderly way,

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
[Amit Varma]: isn't it necessary to have a slightly

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
[Amit Varma]: higher threshold to resist government action

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
[Guest]: than otherwise? I don't think

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
[Guest]: so, but for a couple

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
[Guest]: of reasons. I think there's, we're conflating

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
[Guest]: two possible distinctions here, two distinct

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
[Guest]: things. One is, what's

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
[Guest]: the truth? And the other is, what's useful

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
[Guest]: for people to believe?

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
[Guest]: So, suppose

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
[Guest]: we need a government and it should do certain

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
[Guest]: things. Like, the cases where

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
[Guest]: I think violence or other kinds of action would be

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
[Guest]: justifiable are cases where governments are doing

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
[Guest]: stuff they shouldn't be doing, like

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
[Guest]: violating your rights in various ways, hurting people,

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
[Guest]: shooting people who are pro-

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
[Guest]: I mean, again, you can go on YouTube and see a bunch

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
[Guest]: of cases where you can watch an American police

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
[Guest]: officer put someone on the ground, on

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
[Guest]: their belly, with their handcuffs tied

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
[Guest]: behind their back, and then shoot them.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
[Guest]: And it's like, he's no possible

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
[Guest]: threat. He's not even a threat to a toddler at this

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
[Guest]: point. He can't do anything.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
[Guest]: These are cases where, like, how could

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
[Guest]: deference to that possibly be really useful

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
[Guest]: to get government going? If anything, it's just

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
[Guest]: permitting government to do too much. It's

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
[Guest]: dangerous. But that

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
[Guest]: said, it's true that if you

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
[Guest]: give people a theory about what they ought

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
[Guest]: to do, they might misapply it.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
[Guest]: This is a problem with consequentialist theories in

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000
[Guest]: general. I'm not saying that my theory is consequentialist, but

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000
[Guest]: just to give you an example. So,

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
[Guest]: consequentialist theories say you should make

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
[Guest]: decisions based upon cost-benefit analysis,

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
[Guest]: do what provides the best outcomes,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
[Guest]: and then an objection to that is,

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
[Guest]: yeah, but people are stupid, and they're not good at

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
[Guest]: cost-benefit analysis, and many times when people

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000
[Guest]: try to do it, they'll get the wrong answer.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
[Guest]: The thing that utilitarians will say is,

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
[Guest]: that's true, and so for many people

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
[Guest]: it's useful if they simply believe in certain

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
[Guest]: rules of thumb. So there's a distinction

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000
[Guest]: between what you can call the

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000
[Guest]: criterion of right action, which is the

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
[Guest]: truth about what makes actions right and wrong,

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
[Guest]: versus what's a useful decision

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
[Guest]: procedure for people to use on the ground,

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
[Guest]: because the best decision

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
[Guest]: procedure is specific to

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
[Guest]: you. It's given your psychological

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
[Guest]: biases, what ways, modes of thinking

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
[Guest]: make it most likely you'll do the right

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
[Guest]: thing, as described by the correct theory,

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
[Guest]: whatever that is. You find this,

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
[Guest]: it's not even just a problem in, say, morality, it's a problem

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
[Guest]: in sports. So,

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000
[Guest]: I don't want to use another American example, but I guess I will,

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
[Guest]: in baseball, if a person

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
[Guest]: hits a fly ball into the outfield,

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
[Guest]: the truth of the matter about where that

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
[Guest]: fly ball is going to land is given by

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
[Guest]: a number of equations in physics. You have

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
[Guest]: a complicated vector equation that tells you

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
[Guest]: exactly where the ball is going to land.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000
[Guest]: As an outfielder, you can't

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000
[Guest]: use these physics equations, because you

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
[Guest]: don't have access to all the information you need to solve

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
[Guest]: them, and even if you did, if you knew all the initial

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
[Guest]: conditions, the angle, the spin of the ball,

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
[Guest]: the air pressure, etc.,

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
[Guest]: the angle at which the ball is hit,

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
[Guest]: with what velocity it was thrown, and so on, even if you

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
[Guest]: knew all that, you couldn't do the mathematics

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
[Guest]: in your head fast enough to catch the ball.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
[Guest]: So, what people use on the ground is

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
[Guest]: something called the gaze heuristic, which is a

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000
[Guest]: on-the-ground heuristic that helps them

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
[Guest]: catch the ball. It tracks the truth,

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000
[Guest]: even though it's not itself the correct

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
[Guest]: theory. So, I think that's true

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
[Guest]: of this theory as well.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
[Guest]: It's true that if

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
[Guest]: conspiracy theorists read this, they're going to

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
[Guest]: think, ah, I'm justified in doing all

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
[Guest]: sorts of bad things against government.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
[Guest]: That's not what the theory implies. It's

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
[Guest]: misapplying the theory.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
[Guest]: So, it might be that it's useful for people to

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
[Guest]: have some degree of conformist

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
[Guest]: behavior, even though

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
[Guest]: in reality, the conformity isn't

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
[Amit Varma]: justifiable. You also have a chapter

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
[Amit Varma]: on your book on how

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
[Amit Varma]: it can sometimes be your duty to not follow

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
[Amit Varma]: unjust orders. And, you

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
[Amit Varma]: know, some of the examples for this, you

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
[Amit Varma]: know, will draw us to that intuitively. For

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
[Amit Varma]: example, you cannot sign a contract with somebody else

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
[Amit Varma]: to kill a third person because, you know,

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000
[Amit Varma]: you can't infringe on the third person's rights anyway.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
[Amit Varma]: So, that kind of contract is

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
[Amit Varma]: invalid. But how does one act during

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
[Amit Varma]: war? If your country is attacked,

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
[Amit Varma]: for example, and there is a war and you

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
[Amit Varma]: choose to serve, while being choosed to

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
[Amit Varma]: serve, I would assume that it is

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
[Amit Varma]: normatively desirable for everyone who is serving

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
[Amit Varma]: to just follow orders because otherwise

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
[Amit Varma]: the system breaks down. Everyone can't think

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
[Amit Varma]: for themselves. So, how do you, and

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
[Amit Varma]: in the form of war, you can never divine

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
[Amit Varma]: what actions are just or unjust.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
[Amit Varma]: So, how does one deal with that?

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
[Guest]: Yeah, that's a good question. I mean,

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
[Guest]: my most basic presumption would be something like

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
[Guest]: given how war has gone

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
[Guest]: through history, if you're fighting, you're probably

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
[Guest]: doing the wrong thing. There have been very

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
[Guest]: few cases in history where the soldiers

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
[Guest]: who are fighting should be fighting.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
[Guest]: So, pretty much,

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
[Guest]: in almost any of the European wars that happened,

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
[Guest]: they just weren't justifiable

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
[Guest]: on either side. You're just having land grabs

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
[Guest]: by various noblemen.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
[Guest]: You shouldn't be killing those soldiers and they shouldn't be killing

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
[Guest]: you. The best argument you can

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
[Guest]: have is just, well, I've been conscripted and if I

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
[Guest]: don't fight, they're going to hurt me or hurt my family.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
[Guest]: If your country has actually been

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
[Guest]: invaded and they're

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
[Guest]: attacking, then you

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
[Guest]: have things like, that's when

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000
[Guest]: just war theory comes in. You can think,

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
[Guest]: well, we're allowed to use defensive action to repel

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
[Guest]: them. If I'm attacking

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
[Guest]: combatants who are clearly in uniform

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
[Guest]: and they're clearly the invaders, then that's

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
[Guest]: fine. The problem, though, is

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
[Guest]: usually, when people are fighting wars

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
[Guest]: that are supposedly in self-defense, they're

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
[Guest]: usually invading another country. Governments

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
[Guest]: love to take out just

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
[Guest]: war theory and then say that this

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
[Guest]: invasion that we're doing of another country is actually

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
[Guest]: preemptive, self-defense. They're going to hurt

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
[Guest]: us. We have to stop them.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
[Guest]: So, yeah, I think

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
[Guest]: it's not really that hard.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
[Guest]: Most of the time, you shouldn't be fighting

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
[Guest]: and if you're genuinely being invaded, then you

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
[Guest]: can shoot at the people in the other uniform.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000
[Guest]: When they wave the white flag, then you

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000
[Guest]: stop. You don't kill their civilians. You don't

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
[Guest]: bomb their people. You don't kill their babies.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
[Guest]: You don't use chemicals against them.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
[Guest]: You don't shoot at people in a village

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
[Guest]: who are unarmed.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
[Guest]: You just shoot combatants on the battlefield

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
[Guest]: and then when they leave your country, then

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000
[Guest]: you're good. It's over.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Well, we're almost at the end of our time because

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
[Amit Varma]: we had one hour and

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
[Amit Varma]: I'd urge all my listeners to read your book.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
[Amit Varma]: There's a lot that we haven't covered. For example,

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
[Amit Varma]: not just should we follow orders?

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Is it okay to deceive voters?

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000
[Amit Varma]: The question of does one have a

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
[Amit Varma]: duty that is an obligation to resist

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
[Amit Varma]: or does one merely have

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
[Amit Varma]: the right to resist? I want to end with one

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
[Amit Varma]: final question, though, which is

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
[Amit Varma]: and I don't think you addressed it in your book.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
[Guest]: Should we pay taxes? Yeah,

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000
[Guest]: I guess, you know, at the end of the day, I'm very sympathetic

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
[Guest]: to anarchism, like genuine, full-blown

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000
[Guest]: anarchism. I think anarchy can work

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
[Guest]: better than people give it credit for. There's a nice

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
[Guest]: book on this by Peter Leeson called

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000
[Guest]: is it called

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
[Guest]: Two Cheers for Anarchism? Yeah, Two Cheers

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000
[Guest]: for Anarchism, Why Anarchy Works Better Than You Think.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
[Guest]: That said,

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
[Guest]: you know, I

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
[Guest]: think there's something to be said for the fair play

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
[Guest]: kind of argument. Governments are providing certain

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
[Guest]: kinds of benefits that you are getting

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
[Guest]: in return and even if it's not consensual,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
[Guest]: it's reasonable

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
[Guest]: to do your part, but

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
[Guest]: even in light of that, that's only going to justify

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
[Guest]: some taxes, not usually the amount

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
[Guest]: of taxes that we're paying. So,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
[Guest]: if I'm paying a sugar tariff, there's no reason

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
[Guest]: for me to pay that. That's just simply unjust.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
[Guest]: If I'm paying to support

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
[Guest]: a rent, a government rent, I shouldn't be

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
[Guest]: paying that. That's unjust. If I'm paying

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
[Guest]: for special interest things, that's unjust.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
[Guest]: Most of the military expenditures in the United

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
[Guest]: States, I think, can't be justified. I shouldn't

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
[Guest]: have to pay for those. So,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
[Guest]: yeah, I actually just

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
[Guest]: passed in my taxes today, interestingly.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
[Guest]: So,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
[Guest]: I think my tax bill for this year was

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
[Guest]: $54,000, not including

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
[Guest]: Medicare and Social Security.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
[Guest]: So, that $54,000 I paid

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
[Guest]: to the US government and the other

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
[Guest]: 15,000 or so that I paid to the state

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
[Guest]: government, maybe 15

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
[Guest]: or 20 of that is justifiable and the rest is

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
[Amit Varma]: probably not. I think in India, a higher

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
[Amit Varma]: proportion would be not justifiable.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Jason, thanks so much for

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
[Amit Varma]: giving me your time and chatting with me. I learned

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
[Guest]: a lot today. Yeah, thanks very much. I really appreciate it.

[Amit Varma]: book, When All Else Fails.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
[Amit Varma]: The book contains far more than this episode

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
[Amit Varma]: did. We barely scratched the surface of

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
[Amit Varma]: his arguments. You can follow me on

[Unknown]: and colleagues. What was my first

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
[Unknown]: entrepreneurial venture? Why I chose

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
[Unknown]: Japanese cartoons over animation cartoons

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000

[Unknown]: home to truly stunning diversity.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
[Unknown]: Behind the

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
[Unknown]: veils of smoke that obscure

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
[Unknown]: our thriving cities, our

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
[Unknown]: history is still alive, glimmering

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
