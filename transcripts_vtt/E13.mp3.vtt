00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.400
[Amit Varma]: A few days ago, I decided that I wanted a pet at home. Now, dogs are a clichÃ©, cats

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.080
[Amit Varma]: are selfish, snakes can kill you. So I thought, why not buy a horse? I googled for horse trading

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.520
[Amit Varma]: and I found the number of a firm called Horse Trading Enterprises. I called the number and

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.320
[Amit Varma]: told the guy on the phone that I wanted to buy a horse. He said, no problem, I will bring

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.900
[Amit Varma]: some horses to your apartment and you can choose one. I gave him my address and he said

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.980
[Amit Varma]: he would be there by 4pm. At 4pm, my doorbell rang. I ran over to the door. I really wanted

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.800
[Amit Varma]: a horse in my apartment. I had decided that I would buy a brown horse and I would name

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.960
[Amit Varma]: it Black Beauty, just to confuse everyone. Anyway, I opened the door and there stood

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.440
[Amit Varma]: a guy wearing a t-shirt that said Horse Trading Enterprises.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.480
[Amit Varma]: Sir, you want to buy horses? He asked me. Yes, yes, I said. Show me horses. Do you have

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.960
[Amit Varma]: any brown horses? He smiled. We only have brown horses, he said to me and gestured behind

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.520
[Amit Varma]: him. Four men in kurta-pajama stepped forward from the shadows.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.640
[Amit Varma]: Huh? I said. What is this? These are not horses. The guy said, these are our horses. They are

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.600
[Amit Varma]: all independent MLAs and they are for sale. But I don't want to buy bloody MLAs, I said.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.120
[Amit Varma]: I want to buy horses. The MLAs looked at each other and sniggered. The salesman glared at

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.120
[Amit Varma]: me and said, WTF dude, don't you know what horse trading is?

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.720
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.720
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Baruma. Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen. My subject

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:00.880
[Amit Varma]: today is the anti-defection law of 1985 and my guest is Barun Mitra, an activist and commentator

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.080
[Amit Varma]: based in Delhi. Barun, welcome to the show and tell me a little bit about the intent

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.320
[Guest]: behind the anti-defection law. The anti-defection law had been debated for

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:19.960
[Guest]: 10 years prior to that. And, you know, in the 60s, late 60s and throughout the 70s,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:29.080
[Guest]: there was this discussion about political parties and legislators, individual MPs, MLAs

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.160
[Guest]: changing sides, horse trading. There was a famous term coined, Iyeram Gayaram, based

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:45.840
[Guest]: on two person in Haryana, that they could change parties morning and evening. So, this

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.440
[Guest]: was an issue and this was seen to be a major problem in political instability, creating

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.360
[Guest]: political instability within parties and then at times affecting government. So, this law

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.080
[Guest]: was thought of as a way to prevent this kind of petty defection, so-called to change parties

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.320
[Guest]: if you are elected on a particular party ticket. If you were independent, it won't apply. But

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.120
[Guest]: if one is elected on a party ticket, then it was expected that he would stay with the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:22.720
[Guest]: party and not be allowed to move. So, the anti-defection law became the first law that

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.480
[Guest]: recognized political parties as an entity. The Indian constitution has freedom of association

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.080
[Guest]: under which parties and all other associations operate. But it didn't have any provision

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.320
[Guest]: for a specific political party. So, the 10th schedule first recognized political parties

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:49.200
[Guest]: and then said that the party leadership can disqualify their MPs or MLAs if they defy

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.720
[Guest]: the whip of the party issued on any specific bill on the floor of the house. So, these

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:02.520
[Guest]: two provisions were the critical component. Of course, there was an escape clause too,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.360
[Guest]: which said that if more than one-third people in the party in the legislature wanted to

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.240
[Guest]: change side, they could. But individually, they couldn't. So, now, I think it has been

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.820
[Guest]: raised to two-thirds, that if two-thirds wanted to change, take the whole party, they could,

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:34.640
[Guest]: but not individually. So, these two provisions and you can see the effects. In the sense,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.520
[Guest]: individual defection from one party to another happens only prior to elections in the hope

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.100
[Guest]: of a ticket. It no longer happens as it used to happen in the past. And what you can see

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.980
[Guest]: is that while parties continue to split, I mean, we have thousand-odd parties registered

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:01.660
[Guest]: with the Election Commission, they no longer merge. So, we have one-man parties because

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:09.180
[Guest]: every party, every politician who can form or float a party and survive thinks the risks

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.340
[Guest]: of joining anyone else limits their political options.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.300
[Amit Varma]: So, essentially, the intention of the law was twofold. One, to avoid detection and therefore

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.540
[Amit Varma]: protect parties and organizations, protect apparatus and government. And two, to stop

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.780
[Amit Varma]: political corruption because you couldn't buy MPs anymore and money alone would not

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.160
[Amit Varma]: sway votes, which would seem to be a noble enough intention. What are the unintended

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.940
[Amit Varma]: consequences of the anti-defection law?

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.940
[Guest]: One which had been debated right through the course of the anti-defection discussion from

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:54.540
[Guest]: the 70s through the 80s as well is what impact it has on freedom of expression. After all,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:01.820
[Guest]: MPs, legislators are elected to debate and they're expected to vote. If their choices

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:11.940
[Guest]: are limited, then it does curtail freedom of speech and expression of the elected representative.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:18.220
[Guest]: So, this was a fundamental doubt or a question that hung over this issue for a long time

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:28.700
[Guest]: and it still does. But what was not really recognized or not really seen at that time

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:36.140
[Guest]: was what kind of impact it could have, firstly, on parliament itself, that is, legislator,

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.260
[Guest]: parliaments and assemblies. And it's crippled the functioning of parliament and assemblies

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:53.020
[Guest]: in many cases. And the second one, again, which was not really foreseen was a negative

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:59.980
[Guest]: and perverse impact on the culture of political discourse itself, not just within parliament

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.140
[Guest]: or assemblies, but in the general society as such. And these two, I think, are really

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:13.580
[Guest]: taking a toll now. And one evidence of that is that there are even MPs who are beginning

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:19.340
[Guest]: to voice their concern about this particular anti-defection law.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.820
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we often lament how the quality of political discourse has gone down over the

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:30.900
[Amit Varma]: decades. I mean, if you just see the parliamentary records of the 50s and 60s and the quality

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.340
[Amit Varma]: of discourse is incredibly high and people are tackling very nuanced issues. And what

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.620
[Amit Varma]: would seem with the anti-defection law is you're forced to take one side of an issue

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.860
[Amit Varma]: and therefore it kills nuance, it kills depth of discussion and so on and so forth. Would

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.780
[Amit Varma]: you say there are other cultural factors which caused that or the anti-defection law is a

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.220
[Amit Varma]: very big part of that?

00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:03.900
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at the data, you could say that in the 1950s, Indian parliament used

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:12.300
[Guest]: to sit for between 120 to 130 days a year. That's four months. And typically in a five-year

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:23.860
[Guest]: term of the Lok Sabha, they would pass 300-plus bills, registrations. Today, parliament sits

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:31.540
[Guest]: for barely 70 days and the last Lok Sabha, that is the 15th Lok Sabha of Dr Manmohan

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:39.500
[Guest]: Singh and the UPA government, they could pass only 179 bills, with 68 that lapsed because

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:47.220
[Guest]: Lok Sabha got dissolved, which clearly shows that the quantitative part in terms of sittings

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:57.180
[Guest]: have drastically reduced from 120 and 25 to about 70 and the bills have halved. This was

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:05.220
[Guest]: of course not only a consequence of the anti-defection law, there was a slight tendency or slight

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:11.260
[Guest]: trend towards in the same direction through the late 70s and 80s prior to the anti-defection

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:17.980
[Guest]: when we had absolute majorities in parliament and the belief was, and this was the underlying

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:23.780
[Guest]: philosophy that took shape, that democracy is about majority rule. So, if you have the

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:31.180
[Guest]: numbers, what's the point in a debate? And anti-defection law is a culmination of this

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:39.140
[Guest]: philosophy and this to me has contributed greatly, the philosophy as well as this law

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:45.620
[Guest]: that came out of that philosophy contributed greatly to undermining the democratic culture

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:52.700
[Guest]: in our legislative assemblies as well as in the popular and the discussion and discourse

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.700
[Guest]: outside.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:10:02.180
[Guest]: So, I think the quality of debate, the duration of the sale, the reduction in the timings

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:12.100
[Guest]: of the houses, these are reflections of the deterioration that has been taking place and

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:19.260
[Guest]: what has not been recognized in this majoritarian democratic perspective that has been accepted

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:28.780
[Guest]: widely is without discussion, without debate, without deliberation, what function would

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:35.740
[Guest]: a legislative assembly serve? The whole purpose of a legislative assembly is to provide an

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:41.900
[Guest]: opportunity for elected representatives of the people to consider various proposals to

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:48.940
[Guest]: debate their merits and the pros and the cons, come to certain conclusions and enact. So,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:56.700
[Guest]: you try to win over the other side, you try to persuade the other side and that effort

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.540
[Guest]: depended not just on the fact that you have a majority because the government of the day

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:07.220
[Guest]: is expected to have a majority in any case, but it was part of the culture that you discuss,

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.940
[Guest]: you negotiate, you deliberate, so that you have a much wider social political consensus

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:18.020
[Guest]: on a particular issue, so that it goes through without too much of rancor and bad breath.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:25.620
[Guest]: That sense of political negotiation, bargaining, compromise, getting a sense of coming together

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:31.380
[Guest]: on an issue and taking it forward, that has virtually collapsed. That to me is a huge

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:37.260
[Guest]: tragedy and it has undermined democracy itself because democracy is never about majority

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.260
[Guest]: rule.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:42.900
[Amit Varma]: That's a very insightful point to me because what the anti-defection law therefore seems

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:51.580
[Amit Varma]: to do is it seems to boil all democracy down to the event of the election itself and it

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.940
[Amit Varma]: completely makes parliament irrelevant because once you have the election result, you can

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.940
[Amit Varma]: feed it into a computer and everyone is supposed to vote along party lines anyway, so debate

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.780
[Amit Varma]: and discussion become completely pointless and irrelevant.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:10.540
[Amit Varma]: One interesting thing I noticed, however, is that while it's diminished the quality

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:15.220
[Amit Varma]: of parliamentary discourse, it's not ended the discourse itself. It's just made it far

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.300
[Amit Varma]: more strident and almost violent.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.580
[Guest]: And you can actually see that apart from the quantitative aspects in terms of sittings

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:31.100
[Guest]: and the number of bills passed, which have of course come down, disruptions have increased

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:42.140
[Guest]: and disruptions have become a major strategy or a way to display opposition because debates

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:47.740
[Guest]: don't count, the numbers are known and therefore disruption is the only way opponents can think

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.860
[Guest]: of capturing the headlines.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.300
[Guest]: Almost political posturing in a sense.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.820
[Guest]: And today it has gone down to the, I mean, last few years that even the government side

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:03.180
[Guest]: with a majority is willing to disrupt if they don't want to pursue a particular debate.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.260
[Guest]: So it's not that the government and the opposition are completely divided in terms of the strategies

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.260
[Guest]: to adopt.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:17.820
[Guest]: They both are adopting very similar strategies to avoid debate, discussion if possible.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.580
[Guest]: And to me, there is the other consequence of this or fallout.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:30.020
[Guest]: If MPs are not able to debate, discuss, raise questions, how is an elected government or

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.300
[Guest]: an executive part of the government, how will it be held accountable?

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:42.100
[Guest]: Because it doesn't matter which party you belong, an MP or an MLA is entitled to ask

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:48.060
[Guest]: any question he or she deems fit to the government of the day.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:53.540
[Guest]: The first casualty in many of these situations have been the questioner, where the MPs and

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.820
[Guest]: the MLAs are supposed to have freedom to ask any question they want and the ministers are

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.660
[Guest]: supposed to reply.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.780
[Guest]: But that's gone because now we have disruptions to a large extent.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.460
[Guest]: The second one, so the government's accountability is reduced.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:12.400
[Guest]: So government gets a blank check more often than not, and which you can see that the number

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:19.340
[Guest]: of bills that get passed without any debate through a voice vote mechanism, that everybody

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:24.060
[Guest]: knows the numbers because calls for a voice vote, IAS have it, IAS will always have it,

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.720
[Guest]: so they have it.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:31.980
[Guest]: And the second part is that since we don't have vote, that is legislators as MPs and

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:39.460
[Guest]: MLAs are not voting on specific bills, how will I or you or any citizen of India be able

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.140
[Guest]: to assess their MPs or MLAs?

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:48.620
[Guest]: We don't know on what issue, which MP or my MP or MLA is voting on.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:54.300
[Guest]: We may not know which way an MP might vote, for instance, on the issue of say, the gays

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.580
[Guest]: rights or on any bill or on terrorism laws.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.180
[Amit Varma]: In fact, that renders it almost irrelevant what your MP stands for, because ultimately

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.620
[Amit Varma]: he has to vote with his party and that's the extent of his influence.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.620
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:13.740
[Guest]: And since the attendance has come down, that a lot of MPs and MLAs don't see any point

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:19.540
[Guest]: in being in the assembly or the legislature to debate, to make their point because they

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:24.740
[Guest]: all know that the outcome is a foregone thing.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:30.580
[Guest]: And which means that I and you and citizens of India are deprived because they don't have

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:36.100
[Guest]: a very clear way of knowing which way their MPs and the elected representatives are behaving

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.900
[Guest]: on specific issues, after all, that's what is important.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:48.100
[Guest]: For instance, in the UK, almost 80 to 90% of the bills are voted upon.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:53.780
[Guest]: And people know that which way, and the same is true in the US, that people know which

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.420
[Guest]: way a particular legislature has voted on which issue and therefore you can build up

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.660
[Guest]: a whole political history of a legislator on a specific issue.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.980
[Guest]: We have no way of doing it anymore because we have simply stopped voting and that's because

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:13.940
[Guest]: there's no point in debate and we know the numbers and therefore there's no point in

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.540
[Guest]: holding parliament itself.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.220
[Guest]: That's the logical conclusion.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:22.260
[Guest]: And in some state assemblies, we have reduced annual number of days that the assembly sits

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.260
[Guest]: to less than a month.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.980
[Amit Varma]: So I'd like to go back to something you said earlier when you said that it's not just the

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.780
[Amit Varma]: parliamentary discourse which has diminished because of this, but as a result of political

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:38.180
[Amit Varma]: discourse diminishing in the political space, it's also discourse which has been affected

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.940
[Amit Varma]: outside among the common people.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:40.940
[Amit Varma]: Can you elaborate on that?

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.620
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, that seems to be a very logical conclusion.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:52.460
[Guest]: After all, parliament is the temple of democracy and the way the people behave there obviously

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.620
[Guest]: is transmitted to the rest of the society.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:04.860
[Guest]: And so I won't be surprised if somebody finds that increased disruption inside parliament

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:12.220
[Guest]: is leading to polarization opinion not just within parties, but even across parties outside

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:18.180
[Guest]: parliament that ordinary people are polarized and they take probably a cue from the state

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:23.500
[Guest]: of affairs in parliament and as a state assemblies that debate is pointless, you only need the

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.660
[Guest]: numbers and whoever has the might is right.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:38.980
[Guest]: And the explosion of, what should I say, uncivil discourse, use of unparliamentary language,

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:44.600
[Guest]: not so much inside parliament, but outside parliament has surely multiplied many times.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:50.740
[Guest]: Social media has really allowed that to happen without the presence of a speaker who has

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.620
[Guest]: the power to expunge unparliamentary words.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:18:01.860
[Guest]: So we are seeing this polarization, in my view, seems to be an extension of polarization

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.340
[Guest]: and breakdown of discourse, is an extension of the disruptions and the conflict inside

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.340
[Amit Varma]: parliament.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.380
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it would seem to me that the term unparliamentary language itself needs to be

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.380
[Amit Varma]: revised.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.260
[Amit Varma]: If someone is saying something in a polite manner, that is perhaps unparliamentary in

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.620
[Amit Varma]: the current context.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:21.460
[Amit Varma]: So this finally leads me to the irony that the anti-defection law will therefore be always

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.300
[Amit Varma]: with us because it protects a party establishment and if you can't vote against a party establishment

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.920
[Amit Varma]: because of the law, you can't get rid of the law itself.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.900
[Amit Varma]: So it just perpetuates itself.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:38.420
[Guest]: Yeah, in a way, it might perpetuate itself for a long time.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:46.260
[Guest]: But I think the extent and the intensity of polarization is leading to a sense of realization

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.540
[Guest]: at least among some MPs.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:53.260
[Guest]: For the first time, I'm seeing MPs, at least a few MPs, publicly voicing their concern

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:59.060
[Guest]: about the various implications of this anti-defection law.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:06.620
[Guest]: So I can only hope that that sense will grow because 10 years ago, there was no one talking

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:11.380
[Guest]: about the political and social consequences of anti-defection law.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:19.140
[Guest]: So now that even MPs are beginning to realize that there is a problem, I hope things will

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.140
[Guest]: change.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:25.780
[Guest]: But more than the law itself, what needs to change is our understanding of democracy itself.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:31.180
[Guest]: If we really think democracy is majority rule, then we don't need parliament.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:36.420
[Guest]: If we believe that elections and majority is one time in four years or five years and

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.500
[Guest]: the rest of the time you spend on debate, discussion, deliberations to build a larger

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:46.300
[Guest]: social coalition, the machinery of democracy, then of course, things will change.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.700
[Guest]: And I can just hope for the best.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.500
[Amit Varma]: Varun, thank you so much for coming on the show and talking about the unseen effects

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.500
[Amit Varma]: of the anti-defection law.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.260
[Amit Varma]: It was a pleasure having you here.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.260
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.260
[Guest]: It was nice having you.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.300
[Guest]: Thank you.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.580
[Amit Varma]: And that's the end of today's episode.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:06.500
[Amit Varma]: If you got this far, it means you did not defect from my show to another podcast and

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.780
[Amit Varma]: I thank you for it.
