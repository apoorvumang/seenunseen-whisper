00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720
[Amit Varma]: I had a strange dream the other day.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.720
[Amit Varma]: I dreamed that I was a writer.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.080
[Amit Varma]: Now you may ask, why is this strange?

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.760
[Amit Varma]: After all, I'm a writer in real life.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.860
[Amit Varma]: Well, the reason it was strange is that in my dream, writing was a banned activity.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.360
[Amit Varma]: It was looked down upon by society.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.400
[Amit Varma]: Everyone considered writing shameful.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.040
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it was basically banned by the government.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.160
[Amit Varma]: To practice writing, I had to slink off every day to a place called a Rothel.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.640
[Amit Varma]: There, I would wait in my room or hang around in the balcony looking intellectual until

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.280
[Amit Varma]: a client turned up.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.240
[Amit Varma]: It could be a newspaper editor looking for a column or a features editor asking me to

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.240
[Amit Varma]: write a limerick.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.520
[Amit Varma]: Even an avid blog reader furtively looking around here and there before paying me to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.320
[Amit Varma]: write a blog post or two.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.200
[Amit Varma]: I would write what they wanted me to and they would pay me or my agent.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.760
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes my agent would pass on only a small part of the money to me.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.960
[Amit Varma]: But I couldn't protest or strike off on my own.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.920
[Amit Varma]: Writing was illegal, remember, and therefore the organized underworld ran writing.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.080
[Amit Varma]: And with the connivence of the police, who they paid regular hafta to, I'd be finished

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.720
[Amit Varma]: if I went off on my own.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.720
[Amit Varma]: So in this dream, one day a cop came into my room.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.040
[Amit Varma]: He was there because he needed something from me.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.840
[Amit Varma]: And despite that, he looked at me with distaste as if I was the lowest form of life.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.760
[Unknown]: He said to me, write a limerick for me right away and I won't pay you because I am a policeman

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.480
[Unknown]: and I have power over you and you are lowlife scum.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.480
[Amit Varma]: I was very upset by this.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.240
[Amit Varma]: I couldn't help myself and I burst out with a question that had haunted me for a long

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.240
[Amit Varma]: time.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.340
[Amit Varma]: I asked, what am I doing that is so wrong?

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.480
[Amit Varma]: Why are you treating me with such contempt?

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.800
[Unknown]: He sneered and replied, you are selling your services for money.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.160
[Unknown]: You are selling the labor of your mind for money.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.160
[Unknown]: That is immoral.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.160
[Unknown]: Shame on you.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:13.040
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.400
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.240
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.160
[Amit Varma]: My topic for today is prostitution, specifically the criminalization of prostitution.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.960
[Amit Varma]: Prostitution is generally looked down upon in society, which I find illogical.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.880
[Amit Varma]: What a prostitute does is no different from what a writer or a banker or a cricketer or

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.660
[Amit Varma]: a construction worker does.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.880
[Amit Varma]: We all sell the products of our mind or body for money.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.440
[Amit Varma]: Whatever you may feel about a specific profession, you should not deny us the freedom to pursue

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.440
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.080
[Amit Varma]: We have that right.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.200
[Amit Varma]: And yet society looks down upon it and the law bans it.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.080
[Amit Varma]: I have been writing for years that victimless crimes should not be banned and we recently

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.640
[Amit Varma]: carried a series on this on Pragati, the online magazine that I edit at thinkpragati.com.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.300
[Amit Varma]: We had pieces arguing that alcohol, betting, drugs and prostitution should all be legal.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.440
[Amit Varma]: The piece making the argument for legalizing prostitution was co-written by me and Manasa

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.440
[Amit Varma]: Venkatraman, a young lawyer who works at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.160
[Amit Varma]: If you go to thinkpragati.com and click on the opinion section, you will find our piece

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.720
[Amit Varma]: with the title, Legalize Prostitution to Stop Trafficking.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.240
[Amit Varma]: In it, we argued that banning prostitution is wrong for two reasons.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.400
[Amit Varma]: One, it is morally wrong because it deprives a woman of choice.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.200
[Amit Varma]: Two, it is pragmatically wrong because banning any victimless crime draws the underworld

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.600
[Amit Varma]: in and that never ends well.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.440
[Amit Varma]: Anyway to discuss all that and more, my co-writer of that piece, Manasa is my guest today.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.040
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the show Manasa.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.040
[Amit Varma]: Thank you Amit.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.840
[Amit Varma]: Manasa, one of your pet bugbears about prostitution is the way the Indian law defines it.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.800
[Guest]: Can you tell me a little bit more about that?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.800
[Guest]: Yes.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:09.480
[Guest]: So, prostitution according to the Oxford English Dictionary is just the commercial activity

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.480
[Guest]: of sex.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.440
[Guest]: So, it's the taking of money in return for a sexual service.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.520
[Guest]: However, under Indian law, prostitution is defined with sort of trafficking undertones.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.600
[Guest]: So, the law says that prostitution is the sexual exploitation or abuse of persons for

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.520
[Guest]: commercial purposes.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.920
[Guest]: This clearly shows that there is no objectivity even in the definition of prostitution.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.120
[Guest]: It conflates human trafficking with sex work, with commercial sex work.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.520
[Guest]: And this confusion translates through the entire law.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:51.880
[Guest]: What that does is, tries to protect sex workers, but it fails miserably because it treats them

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.440
[Guest]: as doing something wrong inherently, whereas prostitution is just simply the exchange of

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.440
[Guest]: money for sex.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.440
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.560
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it actually assumes an absence of consent and therefore the question of consent

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.440
[Amit Varma]: doesn't therefore enter the discourse around it because the law assumes that it's simply

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.440
[Amit Varma]: absent.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.440
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:18.440
[Guest]: And we see the importance of consent when dealing with prostitution as a legal subject

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.680
[Guest]: because if you look at Amsterdam, the whole law around prostitution is founded on the

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:32.080
[Guest]: pillar of consent and that is what makes sex workers and sex work such a safe profession

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.080
[Amit Varma]: over there.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.280
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I remember on a TV show many years ago, I think we the people are one of those,

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:45.280
[Amit Varma]: talking about legalizing prostitution and Kiran Bedi was on the show and she was insisting

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.600
[Amit Varma]: that there was no consent involved in prostitution, that no one could possibly choose to be a

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.600
[Amit Varma]: prostitute.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.880
[Amit Varma]: And it so happened that there were actually ladies in the audience who were in that profession

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.560
[Amit Varma]: and they insisted that no, they got into it consensually, which was a point that Bedi

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.760
[Amit Varma]: just refused to accept a lot of dissonance there.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.640
[Amit Varma]: And this is something, you know, when I write about economics and I write about, you know,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.680
[Amit Varma]: things like sweatshops, people often assume that no one can willingly work in those.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.120
[Amit Varma]: So therefore they are akin to slavery.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.800
[Amit Varma]: But what they often don't realize is that people who are not as privileged as us often

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.320
[Amit Varma]: face a set of really bad choices and they make the best choice available to them.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.000
[Amit Varma]: So some, a lot of people go into prostitution because out of all the options open to them,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.040
[Amit Varma]: it's actually the best option.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.680
[Amit Varma]: And that means that the moment then you make prostitution a criminal activity, you are

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.920
[Amit Varma]: telling them to choose an option that they consider worse, you're closing off what they

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.280
[Amit Varma]: consider to be the best option.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.200
[Amit Varma]: Which brings me to the whole moral dimension of banning prostitution, that it's wrong to

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.640
[Amit Varma]: ban prostitution because you are depriving, you are depriving the woman of consent by

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.640
[Guest]: banning it.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.640
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:58.120
[Guest]: And for the state to assume morality on a profession that is as legitimate as anything

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.040
[Guest]: else, as honest as anything else, is just morally wrong.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.680
[Guest]: It is not prostitution that is per se wrong over here.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.720
[Guest]: It is the state looking at it with complete lack of objectivity.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.720
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they're depriving the women of choice, which can't possibly be a good thing.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.600
[Amit Varma]: I want to take a sidestep here and discuss something that we hadn't discussed in article,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.760
[Amit Varma]: which is to sort of try and understand why both social views and the laws are like this.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.400
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things I blogged about many years ago was our Indian law on adultery,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.320
[Amit Varma]: which is section 497 of the Indian Penal Code.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.200
[Amit Varma]: And I'll just read out a bit of it to you and tell me how you react.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.080
[Amit Varma]: Section 497 says whoever has sexual intercourse with a person who is and whom he knows or

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.160
[Amit Varma]: has reason to believe to be the wife of another man, without the consent or connivence of

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.760
[Amit Varma]: that man, such sexual intercourse not amounting to the offense of rape is guilty of the offense

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.160
[Amit Varma]: of adultery.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.320
[Amit Varma]: And it goes on.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.560
[Amit Varma]: But I was particularly shocked by that because according to this law, the consent that mattered

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.760
[Amit Varma]: was not that of the woman committing adultery, but of the man she was married to, therefore

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.560
[Amit Varma]: implying that women are to be looked at as a property of men.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.200
[Amit Varma]: And there are various laws in the Indian Penal Code, which of course originated in Victorian

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.000
[Amit Varma]: times, which are exactly of this kind.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.880
[Guest]: And the adultery section in the IPC is one of the shining examples of what the British

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.260
[Guest]: left us with.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:31.440
[Guest]: Like you're saying under section 497 of the IPC, it is the husband who has the right to

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.200
[Guest]: go to court, but not the wife.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.480
[Guest]: In fact, the wife isn't even wrong.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.280
[Guest]: The wife doesn't even have a say suddenly.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.280
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.440
[Amit Varma]: And a few years ago when I blogged about it, it turned out that some states were actually

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:50.160
[Amit Varma]: planning to expand the scope of the law and 30 odd state governments were asked for a

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:56.560
[Amit Varma]: response by the centre to the Malimath Committee recommendations that even adulterous wives,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:01.840
[Amit Varma]: if they were committing adultery of their own free will, be penalised because they had

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.720
[Amit Varma]: gone against the presumed wishes of their owners, so to say.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.720
[Amit Varma]: So this was many years ago.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.500
[Amit Varma]: I think this Malimath Committee was like 10-15 years ago.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.360
[Amit Varma]: So this is something I'd written 10 years ago, which I just came across.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.920
[Amit Varma]: This brings me to the interesting point that, you know, if women are at one level considered

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.640
[Amit Varma]: to be property, you know, according to Victorian laws and according to these sort of laws,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.640
[Amit Varma]: and that would explain why women who are promiscuous, so to say, are considered to be doing something

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.800
[Amit Varma]: morally wrong per se, which, you know, a promiscuous man, the same assumption wouldn't be made

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.800
[Guest]: about him.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.960
[Amit Varma]: That would make sense.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:42.160
[Amit Varma]: And which also comes to the sort of paradox of how, while when people talk about prostitution,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.240
[Amit Varma]: they assume that there's no consent involved and women are victims, but equally, the word

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.880
[Amit Varma]: prostitute or slut is a cuss word by itself.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, to call someone a prostitute is to abuse that person, you know, which is also

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.200
[Amit Varma]: like where the term prostitute and so on comes from, which is kind of bizarre because the

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.880
[Amit Varma]: law assumes that there is no content, but then the attitude of society towards these

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:09.260
[Amit Varma]: people seems to assume that even if there was consent, it would still be a crime.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:17.600
[Guest]: So last year, a draft bill was proposed in Parliament, which sought to ban trafficking,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.480
[Guest]: and which also discussed prostitution.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.320
[Guest]: But Amit, like you're saying that the current law that we have about sex workers is a remnant

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:32.560
[Guest]: of a colonial era, but shockingly, this bill that was introduced last year is equally badly

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.120
[Guest]: drafted and equally lacks objectivity.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.680
[Amit Varma]: Wow, why is that so?

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:46.720
[Guest]: Because again, it conflates prostitution with trafficking, and it assumes this sort of sorry

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.560
[Guest]: tone when it talks about sex workers throughout its language.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.560
[Guest]: And what does the bill propose to do precisely?

00:10:53.560 --> 00:11:03.360
[Guest]: Oh, it proposes to rescue prostitutes from their brothels and admit them to these homes.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.480
[Guest]: It sets up commissions to inquire into these practices, so on and so forth.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.760
[Guest]: But what stood out for me is that the same tone that was adopted 100 years ago when one

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.080
[Guest]: spoke about sex workers is still adopted last year.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.200
[Guest]: So clearly there is a cultural stagnation that has happened when we speak about this.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.440
[Amit Varma]: And to go back to the argument we made in the piece that we wrote, I mean, our first

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.800
[Amit Varma]: argument which we just discussed was the moral dimension of banning prostitution, that you're

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.920
[Amit Varma]: assuming there is no consent and you're depriving the woman of choice.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.400
[Amit Varma]: But the second one was a practical one, which is what happens when you actually ban prostitution.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:47.120
[Amit Varma]: And here we see something come in that the regulatory economist Bruce Yandel described

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.040
[Amit Varma]: as Baptists and bootleggers.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.040
[Amit Varma]: And the example he takes is of another victimless crime, drinking alcohol, the example he takes

00:11:54.040 --> 00:12:01.040
[Amit Varma]: is of prohibition, where he says that typically prohibition is something that is recommended

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.720
[Amit Varma]: for moral reasons by Baptists.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:09.440
[Amit Varma]: And the people who benefit, therefore, are bootleggers, because, you know, you ban any

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.280
[Amit Varma]: victimless crime, the activity is just going to go underground and it's going to continue.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.320
[Amit Varma]: And that makes Baptists and bootleggers sort of allies in a sense, whether they're overtly

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:24.240
[Amit Varma]: actual allies, like in some places, you actually find bootleggers funding campaigns by Baptists,

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.040
[Amit Varma]: which is, of course, I mean, the politicians who are taking all of these moral stands.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.800
[Amit Varma]: But inevitably, what happens when you ban a victimless crime, whether it's prostitution

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.680
[Amit Varma]: or alcohol, or betting, which is often conflated with match fixing the same way prostitution

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.480
[Amit Varma]: is with trafficking, when you ban a victimless crime, the whole thing just goes underground,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.080
[Amit Varma]: the underworld takes over, and the chances of a lot of trafficking taking place and the

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.000
[Amit Varma]: consent of the women actually not coming into play are far, far higher.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.200
[Guest]: And what happens when, you know, prostitution is made illegal, is that if the woman is then

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.560
[Guest]: coerced into having sex with someone, she cannot go to the police and tell the police

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.280
[Guest]: that she was physically abused, because what she was doing is illegal in the first place.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.360
[Guest]: She'd be the first person to be put in jail.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.360
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.400
[Amit Varma]: And often you'll find that there is this understanding between the police and whatever the local

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.400
[Amit Varma]: mafia is, and therefore the prostitutes themselves are actually helpless because the police are

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.200
[Amit Varma]: hand in glove with the people who run them.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.800
[Amit Varma]: That's a deplorable situation.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:31.880
[Amit Varma]: So tell me something, prostitution was legalized a while back in Bangladesh, have things improved

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.880
[Guest]: there?

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.160
[Guest]: Sadly not.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.160
[Guest]: That's what they found.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:42.360
[Guest]: They legalized prostitution a few years ago in Bangladesh, but the status of the sex workers

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.720
[Guest]: is still the same.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:51.600
[Guest]: They still live in dingy, small rooms, they still have to go through physical abuse, their

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.880
[Guest]: children are still made to see things that no child should.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.920
[Guest]: And this is where it comes through, that while the law is, it is necessary to change the

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.120
[Guest]: law, it is not enough.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.040
[Guest]: This is where cultural change becomes important.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.040
[Guest]: On the one hand you have Amsterdam, and on the other you have Bangladesh.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:21.680
[Guest]: In both countries prostitution is legal, but in one country the sex workers are far safer

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.120
[Amit Varma]: than in the other.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.140
[Amit Varma]: So in other words, what you're saying is that the law has to go hand in hand with society.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.520
[Amit Varma]: Social attitudes remain extremely regressive.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.080
[Amit Varma]: The law alone changing merely is not going to solve the problem overnight.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.080
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely not.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.360
[Amit Varma]: And supposing we do talk about changing the law in India, because it will still help in

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.680
[Amit Varma]: a lot of respects, how likely is that to happen?

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.000
[Amit Varma]: And what's the kind of process that is required to change a law like that?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.800
[Amit Varma]: Can a government do it by itself?

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.240
[Amit Varma]: Does it have to go to parliament for it?

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.680
[Amit Varma]: Do you need a broader sort of consensus?

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.720
[Amit Varma]: Is there one central level law which can be changed, or do all the different states have

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720
[Amit Varma]: their own laws?

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720
[Guest]: How does it work?

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.480
[Guest]: Well, there does need to be fresh legislation.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:07.640
[Guest]: So a new act has to come into being that says that prostitution is legal, it is no longer

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.640
[Guest]: illegal.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:15.080
[Guest]: But before we get to that point, I do want to talk about two things that have already

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.080
[Guest]: happened.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:23.040
[Guest]: One is the famous Varma Committee that was constituted after the Nirbhaya rape incident.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:29.880
[Guest]: So the Varma Committee was tasked with changing criminal law as it is in India right now.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:35.080
[Guest]: And one of the things that they recommended was that prostitution be legalized, voluntary

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:42.400
[Guest]: sex work, they said that this does not equal exploitation, and it must not be confused

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.400
[Guest]: to mean trafficking.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400
[Amit Varma]: Excellent.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:51.960
[Guest]: The second thing that I want to point out is that the courts have the duty to interpret

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.640
[Guest]: the law.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:16:01.000
[Guest]: And the Gujarat High Court has actually done a fantastic job of setting a better tone for

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.160
[Guest]: how sex workers are perceived.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:09.840
[Guest]: In one judgment earlier this year, they said that a transaction between a sex worker and

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:16.440
[Guest]: her customer is purely a commercial transaction, and there is no morality attached to it as

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.020
[Guest]: such and it has to be seen as a business transaction.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:25.340
[Guest]: And this is exactly the kind of tone that we want in our laws as well.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:33.440
[Guest]: So while we have a long way to go, it's heartening to see our courts and scholars actually being

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.120
[Amit Varma]: on the right track.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.400
[Amit Varma]: And do you think these two recent, like in the case of Gujarat, the judgment, and in

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.320
[Amit Varma]: the case of the Justice Varma Committee, their observations, that they're also a reflection

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:48.120
[Amit Varma]: of our society's beginning to view prostitution differently, or are we still stuck in that

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:53.240
[Amit Varma]: backward regressive mode where, you know, slut is a bad word?

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.480
[Guest]: But that's an interesting question.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:02.280
[Guest]: And I actually, my feet are in both lands, so to say, while you have these high courts

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:08.560
[Guest]: and you have these committees that have forward-thinking views, there is a large section of society

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.360
[Guest]: which also is convinced that prostitution is wrong.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.540
[Guest]: I'd say at the most optimistic, we are 50-50.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.580
[Amit Varma]: It is neither this way nor that.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:24.440
[Amit Varma]: So you think 50-50 is optimistic on that note, Manasa, thanks so much for coming on the show.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.440
[Guest]: Thank you.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.440
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit.
