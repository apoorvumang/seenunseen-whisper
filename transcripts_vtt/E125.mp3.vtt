[Unknown]: IVM.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.600
[Amit Varma]: Before we move on with this episode of the scene in the unseen,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.360
[Amit Varma]: do check out another awesome podcast from IVM podcast,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.440
[Amit Varma]: Cyrus Says, hosted by my old buddy, Cyrus Brocha.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.320
[Amit Varma]: I was a professional poker player for a few years,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.880
[Amit Varma]: and even though I was a winning player,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.080
[Amit Varma]: one of the many reasons I left poker was that I felt I was engaged

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.400
[Amit Varma]: in an unproductive activity that contributed nothing to the world.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.240
[Amit Varma]: Poker is a zero sum game,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.280
[Amit Varma]: even a negative sum game if one considers a rate charged by the house.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.160
[Amit Varma]: And the only way a person can win is if someone else loses.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.560
[Amit Varma]: Basically, you have to exploit the mistakes of others.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.560
[Amit Varma]: The real world is not like this.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.560
[Amit Varma]: In everything else I do, whether it's writing or podcasting

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.920
[Amit Varma]: or producing journalism, I only make money if I provide value to others.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.600
[Amit Varma]: When I benefit, so do others.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.280
[Amit Varma]: It's a positive sum game.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.560
[Amit Varma]: No wonder then that gamblers are looked upon with suspicion by non gamblers.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.280
[Amit Varma]: Not that there's anything morally wrong with gambling,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.320
[Amit Varma]: for even the losers are consenting adults.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.160
[Amit Varma]: But it's true that a poker player doesn't make the world a better place

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.560
[Amit Varma]: by playing poker.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.760
[Amit Varma]: Now, there are many things in common with the world of gambling

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.000
[Amit Varma]: in the world of finance,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.680
[Amit Varma]: and many people view finance professionals in the same way,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.840
[Amit Varma]: as if they are just gamblers in a giant casino, creating nothing of value

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.200
[Amit Varma]: and often bringing the rest of the world crashing down,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.080
[Amit Varma]: such as when there's a financial crisis.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.240
[Amit Varma]: And yet, this could not be further from the truth.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.960
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.000
[Unknown]: Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.440
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.400
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.160
[Amit Varma]: My subject today is the importance of finance,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.640
[Amit Varma]: a field that is often misunderstood and misrepresented.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.920
[Amit Varma]: My guest is one of the thinkers I admire most in India,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.520
[Amit Varma]: though I often disagree with him as well, Ajay Shah.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.360
[Amit Varma]: Ajay was my guest in a previous episode a few weeks ago,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.800
[Amit Varma]: talking about creative destruction.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.640
[Amit Varma]: And I hope to make him a regular guest on the scene and the unseen.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.520
[Amit Varma]: Before we cut to this conversation, though, let's take a quick emotional break.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.240
[Amit Varma]: This episode of the scene and the unseen is brought to you by Storytel.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.840
[Amit Varma]: So as long as they sponsor the show, I'm going to recommend one book a week that I love.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.920
[Amit Varma]: The book I want to recommend today is Born Standing Up by Steve Martin.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.160
[Amit Varma]: I haven't actually read it, but my producer Abbas Momin says it's a beautiful,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.200
[Amit Varma]: moving autobiography and I intend to listen to it now that I've found it's on Storytel.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.000
[Amit Varma]: You do the same.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.960
[Amit Varma]: And remember, you get a 30 day free trial only at Storytel.com slash IBM.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.560
[Amit Varma]: Ajay, welcome back to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.880
[Guest]: My pleasure to be here.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.320
[Amit Varma]: So, Ajay, you're a big fan of the world of finance and the world of finance is,

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.240
[Amit Varma]: according to one kind of popular notion, a world full of villains where nothing productive is produced.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.360
[Amit Varma]: And it's like a giant casino where you have hot shot bankers playing with the real lives of people

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.160
[Amit Varma]: who have no control over what's going on.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.880
[Amit Varma]: Does finance deserve this kind of a bed wrap?

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.960
[Guest]: My claim would be that finance is the best example of the seen and the unseen.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:39.920
[Guest]: That the grand drama playing out in financial markets and financial firms is the ultimate

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.840
[Guest]: foundation of all the prosperity and technology and innovation that we see around us today.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.320
[Guest]: That's a grand claim.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.360
[Amit Varma]: So, start breaking it down for me.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.760
[Guest]: OK, so we are used to the world of things.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.240
[Guest]: OK, we have a coffee, we have a cell phone, we buy things from firms and our immediate experiences

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.840
[Guest]: are always about those things.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.280
[Guest]: We see the market economy as a world of things and we appreciate and admire and marvel at all the

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.240
[Guest]: things that the wonderful market economy produces for us.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.320
[Guest]: My shirt, my pants, all these joys, all these pleasures are given to us by the market economy.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.880
[Guest]: That's the scene.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.400
[Guest]: But now we should go one level deeper and ask, how does all this come about?

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.880
[Guest]: Where do the firms come from?

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.120
[Guest]: Where do the innovations come from?

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.920
[Guest]: Where do the decisions of the firms come from?

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.920
[Guest]: And this is where we get to finance.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.920
[Guest]: OK, so it is finance that puts the firms there.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.240
[Guest]: It is finance that tells the firms what to do.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.840
[Guest]: It is finance that creates the incentives for the innovation.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:57.080
[Guest]: So, my first level idea would be that the scene world is being invisibly controlled and shaped and

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.400
[Guest]: influenced every day by the world of finance.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.760
[Guest]: OK, and so let me start with the simplest of all examples.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:13.960
[Guest]: I want to go back to the 1990s, when somewhere in the late 1990s, people started getting the idea that,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.720
[Guest]: you know, you could build a software services company in India.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.960
[Guest]: This was not a mainstream idea for a long time.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.440
[Guest]: Most people don't remember that in 1994, when Infosys did the IPO, it actually did not succeed so well.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.840
[Guest]: It was not a hot IPO in 1994, as you might imagine today.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:39.200
[Guest]: It's only by the late 90s that the idea got around that you can actually run a big, successful

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.960
[Guest]: software services company in India and make a lot of money.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.000
[Guest]: And where did that idea go off?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.520
[Guest]: It went off in the heads of the finance guys.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.760
[Guest]: What did they do?

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.800
[Guest]: They drove up the prices of the shares of the software services companies, the early pioneers like Infosys.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.360
[Guest]: So what that did was it created this publicly visible price, the share price, the valuation, the P.E.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:09.080
[Guest]: ratio, the price to book ratio of these software services companies was stratospheric.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.280
[Guest]: And all around the country, there were people who started looking at those prices and wondering,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.240
[Guest]: you know what, should I be doing something there?

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:24.680
[Guest]: OK, so I was there and I vividly recollect that the, you know, the people who started looking at those

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:31.920
[Guest]: prices, the financial system was shouting out to everybody in the country that if you put 100 rupees

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.760
[Guest]: and build a successful cement company, we will reward you with wealth of 70 rupees.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.840
[Guest]: OK, in other words, don't bother building a cement company, but if you put 100 rupees and succeed in

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.120
[Guest]: building a software company, then we'll give you a wealth of 500 rupees.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.160
[Guest]: That's a price to book ratio of five.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.440
[Guest]: And sure enough, there were attentive people all around the country who are watching that drama

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.280
[Guest]: playing out in the stock prices.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.240
[Guest]: And so you had literally thousands of people in India who started wondering, could we start a

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.080
[Guest]: software company? Do I have a friend who knows how to build software?

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.760
[Guest]: Do I have a cousin that knows how to sell software in London or in Sydney and so on?

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.800
[Guest]: So all across the country, the thought process started springing up that we should really be

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.560
[Guest]: building a software company. And also, we should really not be building a cement company.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:28.480
[Guest]: All these decisions all across the country were invisibly coordinated by one thing, the stock

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.440
[Guest]: market, the valuation of the stock market, reshaped the thought process, the development of

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.520
[Guest]: business plans all around the country.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:42.080
[Amit Varma]: So would it be fair to say that just as in the marketplace of things per se, let's say that I am

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.160
[Amit Varma]: someone who can make a widget for 40 rupees, and I see that day in the market, it's selling for 80

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.240
[Amit Varma]: rupees, and that's an incentive for me to go in.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.480
[Amit Varma]: So the prices are giving me that information.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.320
[Amit Varma]: So similarly, what you're seeing is that what the stock market tells you what the world of

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.840
[Amit Varma]: finance tells you is that software stocks are shooting up, and you're increasing the

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.800
[Amit Varma]: incentives for more and more people to get into it.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.880
[Amit Varma]: Is there a danger of reflexivity here in the sense that can you create a vicious cycle where a

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.200
[Amit Varma]: bubble forms, which is then inevitably going to come down as a dot-com bubble did?

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.280
[Guest]: So now I want to go to the thought process inside the stock market.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.040
[Guest]: And that will give us more insight.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.920
[Guest]: The stock market is not some magical construct.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.360
[Guest]: It's just composed of people.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.600
[Guest]: It's composed of people like you and me.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:32.320
[Guest]: And the prices at which trades take place reflect the views of people.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.680
[Guest]: So those are smart people.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.600
[Guest]: They are looking at all the available information.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.520
[Amit Varma]: So that's your demand side basically reflecting it.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.280
[Guest]: Wait, I just want to highlight the limitations of the process.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.680
[Guest]: The people who are trading the shares are looking at the world, are commanding information

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.840
[Guest]: about the world, are trying to make forecasts about the world, and these forecasts will

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.960
[Guest]: necessarily go wrong.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.320
[Guest]: And that's perfectly OK.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.160
[Guest]: The future will always be unknowable.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.280
[Guest]: Some things will go wrong.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.440
[Guest]: So every now and then there will be mistakes.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.160
[Guest]: We should not think about this as some flawless central planning system where decisions will

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.200
[Guest]: always be perfect.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.640
[Guest]: So yes, what you call a bubble, I call mistakes.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.440
[Guest]: Mistakes will always happen, that there will be a time when everybody thinks that nanotechnology

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.080
[Guest]: is going to work and there will be a rush of investment into nanotechnology firms.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.960
[Guest]: And some years later, people will think, nah, that didn't really work.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.720
[Guest]: We did not really make money in that and there will be money that is wasted.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.280
[Guest]: And that's OK.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.320
[Guest]: That's a part of life.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:30.240
[Guest]: The point is that the stock market is the place where a lot of smart people come together

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:36.720
[Guest]: and form views about the future and not just write blog articles about those views, but

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.240
[Guest]: put their money where their mouth is.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.520
[Guest]: People do trades with real money and do their best in trying to forecast the future.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.520
[Guest]: So there is a remarkable alignment between the personal self-interest of the people trading

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:56.880
[Guest]: the market and the connections between the prices that are produced and the allocation

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.320
[Guest]: of resources in society.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.600
[Guest]: So there is self-interest part and then there is a positive externalities part.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.680
[Guest]: These prices create positive externalities.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.920
[Guest]: The whole country benefits because we are able to run a self-organizing system surrounding

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.640
[Guest]: those prices.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.760
[Guest]: So everybody knows the price to book of a hospital.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.840
[Guest]: Now, thousands of people all over the country will wonder, should I start a hospital?

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.360
[Guest]: Should I not start a hospital?

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.160
[Guest]: But doesn't this create a set of two incentives?

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.960
[Amit Varma]: For example, earlier, if you're starting a business, your incentive is can I make a profit?

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.480
[Amit Varma]: Can I create a product for 40 rupees which somebody will buy for 60 rupees?

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.520
[Amit Varma]: So that's my profit.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.080
[Amit Varma]: But now there's another incentive which comes in where this profit in the marketplace of

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.200
[Amit Varma]: things doesn't matter.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.640
[Amit Varma]: That, you know, can I have an IPO and am I in the sector which is hot right now, which

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.120
[Amit Varma]: could be dot com once upon a time, which could be, say, biotech right now, and it doesn't

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.560
[Amit Varma]: matter what the product is and whether it ever makes a profit as long as the stock

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.600
[Guest]: market value is high.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.760
[Guest]: Well, in the end, people do want profit.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.960
[Guest]: So I think the financial system has demonstrated the ability to invest for long time periods

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.400
[Guest]: in losing propositions.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.200
[Guest]: So in fact, 10 years ago, the criticism or 20 years ago, the criticism would have been

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.800
[Guest]: that the short term attention to profit is a mistake.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.720
[Guest]: Well, today we've seen many sectors, most notably clean energy, where the financial

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.760
[Guest]: system understood maybe 10 years ago that global warming was a problem and there is

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:28.320
[Guest]: going to need to be gigantic development of technologies and infrastructure around clean

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.120
[Guest]: energy.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.400
[Guest]: And the financial system was willing to commit very large resources into these firms, even

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.240
[Guest]: though they were presently not making money.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.920
[Guest]: But it was the bet of people in the financial system that, you know, give it time, it's

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.120
[Guest]: going to make money in the future.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.360
[Guest]: So the stock price is just the net present value of all the dividends that are going

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.480
[Guest]: to come out in the future.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.080
[Guest]: Nobody is here for charity.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.080
[Amit Varma]: In fact, a great example that you gave me when we were chatting about this before of

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.440
[Amit Varma]: how a bet by the stock markets actually makes a huge impact in the real world is what happened

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.880
[Amit Varma]: in the late 1990s when, you know, optical cabling, for example.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:09.120
[Guest]: Yeah, so optical communications is a late 90s, early 2000s revolution, which was led

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.240
[Guest]: by the financial system.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.040
[Guest]: People understood that there is going to be an explosion of data and we need a whole new

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:21.840
[Guest]: generation of switches and computing capabilities surrounding mind-blowing levels of bandwidth.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.000
[Guest]: And there was a series of startups which got large investment by the venture capitalists.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.520
[Guest]: And it actually worked out well.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:35.040
[Guest]: And we got that gigantic escalation of capabilities inside many of those engineering

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:35.520
[Guest]: companies.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:40.720
[Guest]: So the role of the financial system is to look into the future and translate that into

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.280
[Guest]: a structure of payoffs for entrepreneurs.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.760
[Guest]: So in our old world of Hayek and the world of things, we would be talking the profit

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.720
[Guest]: rate of a company.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.720
[Guest]: We'd be talking about the profit for one year.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.920
[Guest]: What finance does is it takes profits over many years and turns that into a net present

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.400
[Guest]: value.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.120
[Guest]: And also it brings the word risk into the equation, which is, of course, important.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.080
[Guest]: So risk and reward come together in finance.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:10.800
[Guest]: And what finance does ultimately is it creates a structure of incentives for what industries

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.320
[Guest]: should expand, what kinds of tools and technologies and products are going to be important in

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.200
[Guest]: the future.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.080
[Guest]: And it sends out incentives for firms and managers and entrepreneurs to build those

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.280
[Guest]: kinds of capabilities.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.160
[Guest]: And that's the invisible way in which the phrase is used that Wall Street runs Main

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.960
[Guest]: Street, that Wall Street figures out these prices and then Main Street responds to those

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.760
[Amit Varma]: prices.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.480
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that those incentives also work in drawing the best minds to finance

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.840
[Amit Varma]: because there is so much money to be made.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.760
[Amit Varma]: The best minds come to finance.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.000
[Amit Varma]: And when they are putting their money where their mouth is, you have to take that seriously.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.040
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, you have the best minds coming together for good incentives, setting the

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.760
[Amit Varma]: agenda for...

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.920
[Guest]: So I have mixed feelings on this.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.640
[Guest]: So first, I don't think that there's a shortage of minds.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.200
[Guest]: Okay.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.120
[Guest]: So I think there's a very large supply of wonderful people in the world.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.920
[Guest]: And I don't think that there is a shortage of minds.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.840
[Guest]: Some good minds come into podcasting as well.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.080
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.040
[Guest]: So I think that there is a great deal of brilliant and wonderful humans all over the world in

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.920
[Guest]: many, many lives and careers and professions.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:20.480
[Guest]: So some people have a negative view that there's a PhD physics guy who's now trading in a hedge

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.560
[Guest]: fund, and that's a bad use for society.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.360
[Guest]: And I don't agree.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.520
[Guest]: I think there's no shortage of talent.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.560
[Guest]: That's one point.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.160
[Guest]: My second point is that, yes, exactly.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.280
[Guest]: As you say, you need to bring in some of the best capabilities into finance because finance

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.320
[Guest]: is that important.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:40.160
[Guest]: I mean, finance has to think about the world, form views about the future and reshape the

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.040
[Guest]: world around us.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:48.000
[Guest]: So we see this most vividly in the high technology space where many a successful engineer and

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.320
[Guest]: entrepreneur starts a second life as a venture capitalist.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:52.480
[Guest]: Okay.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:59.360
[Guest]: So for example, the great engineer Bill Joy, who was one of the key people in BSD Unix,

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:04.560
[Guest]: one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, then turned into a partner at Kleiner Perkins.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.760
[Guest]: And that's the kind of genius that is applying its mind to thinking about what investments,

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.400
[Amit Varma]: what industry.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.320
[Amit Varma]: Like his co-founder at Sunway North Coast Line.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.680
[Guest]: Who is also a venture capitalist.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:19.520
[Amit Varma]: And you've described finance as the brain of the economy and use venture capitalism.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.440
[Guest]: Joseph Stiglitz says that finance is the brain of the economy.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.280
[Amit Varma]: So break that down for me.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.320
[Guest]: So all this thinking work is what Joseph Stiglitz calls the brain of the economy.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.240
[Guest]: That it is finance that has to think.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.560
[Guest]: It is finance that awards valuations.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.040
[Guest]: It is finance that is like the commanding heights of the economy, to use a Nehruvian

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.440
[Guest]: term, what you would have thought the planning commission would do.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.840
[Guest]: That the planning commission will decide that, you know what, we need to build integrated

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.320
[Guest]: circuits.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.920
[Guest]: We need a VLSI fab in India.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.640
[Guest]: We don't need a VLSI fab in India.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.800
[Guest]: These are all the things that are ultimately now controlled by the financial system.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.280
[Guest]: So that is why Joseph Stiglitz calls finance the brain of the economy.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.800
[Guest]: My good friend Josh Feldman tells a very interesting story.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.440
[Guest]: He says that suppose there was an earthquake.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.920
[Guest]: I think you were there when he told this story.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.280
[Guest]: He said, suppose there is an earthquake and the entire Bombay gets destroyed.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:13.600
[Guest]: Okay.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.640
[Guest]: And suppose we had to pick up the pieces and start over.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.320
[Guest]: What is the first thing that we would do?

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.960
[Guest]: Answer.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.120
[Guest]: We would rebuild the financial system.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.280
[Guest]: Because the financial system would then fund everybody else and the rest of Bombay would

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:25.680
[Amit Varma]: get built.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.680
[Amit Varma]: So before you build the schools, build the banks.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.560
[Guest]: Everything will flow from there.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.240
[Guest]: The first thing you got to get in place is the financial system.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.920
[Amit Varma]: And that's sort of a very telling analogy of a planning commission as say something

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.520
[Amit Varma]: that's doing central planning, but it's centralized and it cannot possibly have access

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.360
[Amit Varma]: to all the information and therefore it invariably messes up.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.000
[Amit Varma]: But this is sort of the brain of the economy, but all the information is decentralized.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.720
[Guest]: It's coming from.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.320
[Guest]: It's a self-organizing brain.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:50.720
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.760
[Guest]: So we combine the brain, but yet it's a self-organizing system and there's no compulsion.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.720
[Guest]: There's no coercion.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.200
[Guest]: Okay.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:57.840
[Guest]: You're welcome.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.720
[Guest]: I'm welcome.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.560
[Guest]: Everybody's free to look at the system of prices and disagree that.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.520
[Guest]: No, I don't agree.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.240
[Guest]: I think aluminum is much more important than you guys think it is.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:06.800
[Guest]: Very good.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.320
[Guest]: Put your money where your mouth is.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.600
[Guest]: Buy aluminum futures or buy the shares of aluminum companies.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.760
[Amit Varma]: And where does a VC get his signals from?

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.920
[Amit Varma]: Where does he get his, what are his incentives?

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.520
[Guest]: Where does he get his knowledge from?

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.480
[Guest]: By looking at the world.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.880
[Guest]: So the VC's job is supposed to be to look at the world and figure, I think these technologies

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.840
[Guest]: are going to be important.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.520
[Guest]: These business models are going to be important.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.840
[Amit Varma]: And the markets are a reflection of that, the stock markets.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.240
[Guest]: So the VC turns around and shapes the projects.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.680
[Guest]: The VC is looking in the future.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.680
[Guest]: And also remember the VC likes to take his project ultimately IPO.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.440
[Guest]: So the VC needs to look at the stock market.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.720
[Guest]: So the stock market says what kind of price to book ratios are attractive and the VC is

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.720
[Guest]: guided by the possibility.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.600
[Guest]: For example, Indian healthcare, Indian NBFCs, when these price to book ratios were very

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:58.080
[Guest]: high, we got a surge of private equity funds building projects in these areas.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.200
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:05.280
[Amit Varma]: And what about more arcane forms of finance like derivatives or like the kind of complex

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.000
[Amit Varma]: instruments that led to the 2008 crash?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.160
[Guest]: So far, I've talked about the stock market.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.920
[Guest]: I've emphasized the share price.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, there are two more things that need to go into this.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.560
[Guest]: That need to go into this and both of them connect to derivatives.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.120
[Guest]: The first is that, OK, suppose you're this super smart guy and you have an opinion that

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.240
[Guest]: the share price of Infosys is going to do well.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.200
[Guest]: You have two choices.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.600
[Guest]: Case one, you will put down 100 rupees and buy the shares of Infosys.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:38.400
[Guest]: Case two, you will put down 25 rupees and get a position on 100 rupees of Infosys.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.240
[Guest]: OK, so you get a four times leverage.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.480
[Guest]: By only putting 25, you get position of 100.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.400
[Guest]: You're going to prefer the leveraged position.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:52.880
[Guest]: OK, so for people with too much brains and not much money, you are benefited by having

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.000
[Guest]: a leveraged position.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.680
[Guest]: And that is what the derivatives do.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:02.000
[Guest]: So financial derivatives allow the injection of knowledge and ideas into the process of

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.760
[Guest]: price discovery while giving a magnification where people who have more brains and not

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.240
[Guest]: enough money are able to participate in the price formation process.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:19.600
[Guest]: The other side of the derivatives is derivatives trading on physical commodities, whether it

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.840
[Guest]: is aluminum or wheat or butter or eggs.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.920
[Guest]: These are very important markets that directly link to the physicals.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.720
[Guest]: So there you directly see that six months from now, eggs are going to be expensive.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.280
[Guest]: So you start getting incentives to build more eggs starting from today.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.680
[Guest]: So the derivatives markets there directly connect into the world of things.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.480
[Amit Varma]: And this is not some abstract thing, you know, people sitting in Wall Street offices do.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.920
[Amit Varma]: This has a very real impact.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.480
[Amit Varma]: And one field in which you've pointed out where it could help, and I had an episode

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.720
[Amit Varma]: on this a long, long time ago with Karthik Shashtar on futures markets in agriculture,

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.320
[Amit Varma]: where, you know, people just hear the phrase futures market in agriculture and they're

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.200
[Amit Varma]: like, what the hell?

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, we have, you know, the agriculture is in a crisis.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.560
[Amit Varma]: You need to kind of, you know, there are enough problems in the real world.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.080
[Amit Varma]: Why would you gamble with it?

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:12.480
[Amit Varma]: But your point is that a lot of the problems of agriculture and the problems of the common

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.320
[Amit Varma]: humble farmer can be sorted out if there are futures markets in agriculture.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.760
[Guest]: And I would tell that in two steps.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.600
[Guest]: So let's start from the world of things.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.320
[Guest]: I think it is useful to see that there are two very big decisions that are made in the

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.280
[Guest]: world of food.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.120
[Guest]: Question one, what do I sow?

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.520
[Guest]: Question two, what do I store?

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.720
[Guest]: Okay, these are the two decisions that are made.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.000
[Guest]: The rest is lotteries.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.600
[Guest]: Okay, so I sow something, but the rain doesn't come or the locusts come.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.600
[Guest]: So there are many other shocks that come along.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.800
[Guest]: But in terms of the decisions made by real people in the world of food, there are two

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.840
[Guest]: decisions above all.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.360
[Guest]: Question one, what to sow?

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.040
[Guest]: Question two, what to store?

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.720
[Guest]: Okay, how do you make those decisions?

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.760
[Guest]: For these decisions, you need to have a view about the future.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.600
[Guest]: You need to have a forecast about the future.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:01.280
[Guest]: What we see in India every now and then is something that comes out of a model that was

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.360
[Guest]: written by the economist Paul Samuelson many, many decades ago.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.120
[Guest]: Okay, he calls it the cobweb model.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.880
[Guest]: Okay, that's a story that runs like this, that there's a shortage of tomatoes.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.640
[Guest]: The tomatoes are very expensive.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.120
[Guest]: So lots of farmers rush in and sow tomatoes.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.640
[Guest]: So then you get a great surge.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.000
[Guest]: You get a huge crop of tomatoes.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.000
[Guest]: The price of tomatoes crashes.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.480
[Guest]: And then farmers get very unhappy.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.000
[Guest]: And then they do not sow tomatoes.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.680
[Guest]: And then the cycle starts all over again.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.120
[Guest]: Okay, this is called the cobweb model.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.520
[Guest]: And this is just a cycle of sadness that you're screwed when there's a glut of tomatoes.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.600
[Guest]: You're screwed when there's a shortage of tomatoes.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.040
[Guest]: And this thing just goes on.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.400
[Guest]: How do you break this cycle?

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.040
[Guest]: The answer lies in futures trading.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.760
[Guest]: What you need is a futures market to say that, look, six months from now, we believe the

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.600
[Guest]: price of eggs will be so much.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:51.760
[Guest]: Six months from now, we are able to see the prospective outcome of the Kharif harvest

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.960
[Guest]: of India today.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:22:00.240
[Guest]: Now, if that information was produced by a deep and liquid and active market, then a

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.240
[Guest]: sowing decision could be taken by using that public good of the price.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.480
[Guest]: Okay, so as a farmer, I could choose to use that information.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.920
[Guest]: What will be the price of wheat?

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.280
[Guest]: What will be the price of rice?

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.720
[Guest]: What are all my alternatives?

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.560
[Guest]: What are all the future prices?

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:20.640
[Guest]: Come October, when the Kharif harvest comes out, I see all the futures prices.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.160
[Guest]: And based on that, I work out my profits and I choose to sow one.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.720
[Guest]: Okay, that's an incredible information resource.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.320
[Amit Varma]: So your farmer is then guided by the wisdom of crowds.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.040
[Amit Varma]: Whereas otherwise, look, the farmer is gambling anyway.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.640
[Amit Varma]: But here he has far more information if there are good futures markets for him to gamble.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.320
[Guest]: And it's much more than information.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.160
[Guest]: The futures market is not just an opinion.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.360
[Guest]: It's not an opinion poll.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.280
[Guest]: People are putting their money where their mouth is.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:50.000
[Guest]: So the farmer can choose to actually enter into a contract to sell goods at Dusshera

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.080
[Guest]: when the Kharif harvest comes out at that price that is visible in the futures market.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.520
[Guest]: So it's not just an opinion poll.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.360
[Guest]: It's not a hypothetical view of the future.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.360
[Guest]: It is people putting their money where their mouth is.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.920
[Guest]: And then he's guaranteed that, okay, I will get that price.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.920
[Guest]: And he has other risks.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.600
[Guest]: There is a crop failure problem.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.080
[Guest]: There is a locust problem, many other problems.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.240
[Guest]: But at least price risk is something that futures markets excel at doing.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:12.560
[Guest]: Okay.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.720
[Guest]: And again, the seen and the unseen.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.440
[Guest]: Many people want that proof of truth.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.560
[Guest]: They want to see if the farmer is directly selling goods on the futures market.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.320
[Guest]: You think the futures market is useful.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.320
[Guest]: And I think that's a very incomplete view of the world.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.400
[Guest]: The futures market is useful if it reshapes the structure of information.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.480
[Guest]: If it changes the way people think.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:32.960
[Guest]: Full stop.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.800
[Guest]: You don't have to have direct participation.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.120
[Guest]: Okay.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.840
[Guest]: And now let me come to part two, which is the storage decision.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:38.720
[Guest]: Okay.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.920
[Guest]: So I'm a person who has capital, who has a warehouse.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.920
[Guest]: And I see a price of wheat on the spot market today.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.080
[Guest]: And I see the price of wheat six months into the future on the futures market.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:50.480
[Guest]: Okay.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.600
[Guest]: And if I see a good gap between the two, then I think to myself,

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.640
[Guest]: why don't I buy goods on the spot market and put them in a warehouse?

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:57.600
[Guest]: Okay.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.200
[Guest]: That's a storage decision.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.760
[Guest]: So thousands of storage decisions all around the country

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.760
[Guest]: are taken by using the futures price as a reference.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.400
[Guest]: And maybe entering into a contract also to sell through the futures exchange.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.360
[Guest]: But it doesn't need to be.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.320
[Guest]: The futures price is a public good.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.800
[Guest]: And it can reshape the decisions of storage.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.440
[Guest]: And you can see how the sewing decision and the storage decision are both very important.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:26.880
[Guest]: So if people will not store at the right time, it will generate a glut on the spot market.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:33.360
[Guest]: So you want this entire machinery that in June, when the Kharif sewing is being done,

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.040
[Guest]: you want a good sewing decision.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.280
[Guest]: In October, when the crop comes out, you want a good storage decision.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.440
[Guest]: All these decisions are coordinated by the futures market.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.480
[Amit Varma]: How do agriculture future markets work in other countries?

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.480
[Guest]: This is exactly how they work in other countries.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:48.720
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:54.560
[Amit Varma]: And what is sort of, is it again a mindset problem for why Indian policymakers don't

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.960
[Amit Varma]: let these happen or other interest groups which benefit from these not happening?

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:04.880
[Guest]: So I think we have a lot of baggage, emotional baggage around hoarding of food.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.720
[Guest]: We have a skepticism about trading.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.320
[Guest]: I think we think trading is a bad thing.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.600
[Guest]: So some of these primeval fears keep coming up from time to time.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.120
[Guest]: And we've done a great deal of government interventions

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.960
[Guest]: that have limited the ability of the futures market to work.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:51.120
[Unknown]: We'll take a quick commercial break and we'll come back in a minute.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.480

[Unknown]: And with that, let's continue with your show.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.800
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the Scene in the Unseen.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.600
[Amit Varma]: I am chatting with Voldemort Ajay Shah about the evil world of finance,

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.200
[Amit Varma]: which sucks hope from us.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.480
[Amit Varma]: So you're making the case that that's quite the opposite.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:54.160
[Guest]: I think that finance is the invisible knowledge and information system

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.000
[Guest]: that runs the market economy.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.760
[Amit Varma]: Now, one interesting point that you made,

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.280
[Amit Varma]: which I'd like you to elaborate on,

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.760
[Amit Varma]: is that financial markets also set the price of time.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.320
[Amit Varma]: Explain this.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.720
[Guest]: I want to borrow money today that I will repay you next year.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.160
[Guest]: Okay, so that's an interest rate.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.280
[Guest]: That's the price of that delay of one year.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.160
[Guest]: And it could be two years.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:14.880
[Guest]: It could be five years.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.680
[Guest]: It could be 30 years.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.000
[Guest]: This price is discovered on the bond market.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.480
[Guest]: So there is a giant edifice called the bond market where there are traders.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:30.560
[Guest]: Some people in the economy want to put money in today and get it out tomorrow.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.240
[Guest]: Some people want to take money today and return it tomorrow.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:38.320
[Guest]: And all these relationships are sold out on the bond market.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.080
[Guest]: And bottom line, the bond market delivers a number to the economy.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:46.320
[Guest]: It's an information system that delivers the price of time to the economy.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.800
[Guest]: So whether you're going to take a home loan or you're going to build a bridge,

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.800
[Guest]: this is the infrastructure that makes it possible.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:29:00.800
[Guest]: So the noisy, tumultuous process of trading and speculation

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.080
[Guest]: and bond market, bond futures, all that stuff results in one outcome.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.200
[Guest]: And that outcome is the economy understands the price of time.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.520
[Guest]: And that is, again, not an opinion poll.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.560
[Guest]: It is people who are putting their money where their mouth is.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.960
[Guest]: So when you build a bridge and you are going to borrow for 10 years

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.280
[Guest]: or 20 years in order to be able to pay for that bridge up front,

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.360
[Guest]: you are the user of this market in time.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.560
[Guest]: So all long dated projects, which involve borrowing,

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.720
[Guest]: ultimately feed off the giant public markets in the form of the bond market.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.200
[Amit Varma]: How does the central bank fit into all this?

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.880
[Amit Varma]: And if they're setting interest rates and so on?

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.440
[Guest]: The central bank controls the short term interest rate.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.200
[Guest]: In a proper market economy,

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.240
[Guest]: the central bank should only control the short term interest rate.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.240
[Guest]: So it could be at a one day horizon.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.920
[Guest]: It could be at a one week horizon.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.920
[Guest]: All other rates should be discovered by the market economy.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.040
[Guest]: OK, now this may often not be the world that we live in.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.240
[Guest]: We may often have interventions by the government

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.600
[Guest]: in trying to reshape interest rates at different maturities.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:11.360
[Guest]: But that's part of the larger agenda of the role of the price system in India.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.800
[Guest]: But in a conceptual frame and what we see happening

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.280
[Guest]: in mature market economies all over the world

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.800
[Guest]: is that the role of monetary policy is to control the short term interest rate.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.560
[Guest]: After that, all other rates are produced by the private sector.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.600
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps this is a subject for a separate episode on its own.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.280
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is that if we know that just allowing markets to function

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.480
[Amit Varma]: and set the price of everything is overwhelmingly good for society

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.240
[Amit Varma]: and any interference with that is a problem,

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.480
[Amit Varma]: then why an exception in the case of the central bank setting short term interest rates?

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.600
[Guest]: That is subject for a separate episode.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.240
[Guest]: It turns out that the creation of fiat money intrinsically comes with that one lever.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.200
[Guest]: So in the olden days, we used to say the central bank controls the printing presses.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.800
[Guest]: OK, the moment you decide to build fiat money,

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.080
[Guest]: you control that printing press.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.000
[Guest]: We are now in what is called a Wicksellian world

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.560
[Guest]: where the printing press is controlled by this decision to set the short rate.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.000
[Guest]: And it turns out that by controlling the short rate,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.520
[Guest]: we're able to exercise a stabilizing force on the business cycle.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.920
[Amit Varma]: So that's why that one rate is special.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:21.280
[Amit Varma]: Now tell me about, you so far told me how the financial system is a brain of the economy.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.400
[Amit Varma]: Wall Street today determines what Main Street will do tomorrow,

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.120
[Amit Varma]: how the information plays out, how the incentives play out.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.480
[Amit Varma]: All of that is great.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.520
[Amit Varma]: Now, whenever I hear, whenever I think of well-functioning markets, I also worry about

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.920
[Amit Varma]: a well-meaning state messing it all up.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.480
[Amit Varma]: What are the different ways in which the state can interfere with financial markets?

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.160
[Guest]: So I have described a world where the financial markets work well.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.160
[Guest]: OK, by default, financial markets do not necessarily work well.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.680
[Guest]: And there are market failures.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:58.080
[Guest]: So the classes of market failure that we see in finance is there is an externalities problem.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:04.560
[Guest]: If there is collapse of a financial firm or a collapse of the financial market system,

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.200
[Guest]: it imposes harm upon innocent bystanders.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.960
[Guest]: So there is an externalities problem.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:15.280
[Guest]: There is an asymmetric information problem in that when you are the user of a bank,

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.560
[Guest]: you do not know the soundness of the bank.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.760
[Guest]: You do not know whether the bank will actually live up to its promises.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.960
[Guest]: So it's an unreasonable amount of effort.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:30.160
[Guest]: It's a bit like a food safety thing that if you and I go buy medicines in a shop,

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.360
[Guest]: we can't be expected to test the purity of the medicine.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.640
[Guest]: So like that, there is an asymmetric information problem in the statements that the

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.720
[Guest]: financial firms make to their consumers.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:47.440
[Guest]: So these two problems require a set of regulatory interventions.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:52.720
[Guest]: OK, and the regulatory interventions in finance basically fall into four categories.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.280
[Guest]: Case one is called consumer protection,

00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:00.880
[Guest]: where you're just helping households be protected against unfair trade practices.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.760
[Guest]: Case two is called microprudential regulation,

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:08.880
[Guest]: where we don't allow the financial firms to collapse too often.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.600
[Guest]: Element three is called resolution,

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.120
[Guest]: which is a specialized bankruptcy code for financial firms.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.240
[Guest]: And case four is called systemic risk regulation,

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:23.200
[Guest]: where you deal with the possibility of the entire financial system collapsing in a crisis.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.440
[Guest]: These four functions are required to be performed by a government apparatus.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.160
[Guest]: OK, now what goes wrong is all too often such government apparatus

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.440
[Guest]: turns into central planning.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.040
[Guest]: OK, and that is indeed where we came from.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:41.920
[Guest]: Not so long ago, there was not a whiff of a normal financial market system in India,

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.600
[Guest]: and all we had was central planning.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.560
[Guest]: And we are constantly torn between these impulses.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.720
[Guest]: So what we in India are at is the early stages of understanding

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.920
[Guest]: what is the role of finance in society,

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:59.200
[Guest]: and of reorienting the government machinery away from central planning,

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.920
[Guest]: from controlling all the prices of time rather than only being in the short end,

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:10.000
[Guest]: and actually producing these four kinds of responses correctly and efficiently.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.960
[Guest]: And many things go wrong.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.880
[Guest]: So I'm not here to say we are sorted.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.200
[Guest]: I'm not here to say we have a well-functioning financial system in India.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.040
[Guest]: I'm not here to say that our government machinery

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.200
[Guest]: for doing these four kinds of things is in place.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.080
[Guest]: But I am here to say that this is the kind of role

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:33.440
[Guest]: that the financial system should be playing in a market economy.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.960
[Guest]: And this is the kind of world that we have to build around us in India.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.040
[Amit Varma]: So one of the dangers you pointed out of an unregulated financial system

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and where the government needs to step in is externalities.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.240
[Amit Varma]: And again, you know, this brings me to the example of the 2008 crisis.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.800
[Amit Varma]: And again, your points two and four microprudential and then systemic risk.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.640
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, the US government, of course,

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.400
[Amit Varma]: bailed out AIG and Fannie and Freddie and so on in 2008,

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.080
[Amit Varma]: allowed Lehman to collapse because there was what they called a systemic risk.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.560
[Amit Varma]: And then pumped in a lot of money and basically bailed a whole lot of them out.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.880
[Amit Varma]: Instead of letting them collapse, as you would expect,

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.400
[Amit Varma]: if you, you know, just followed the path of creative destruction,

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.920
[Amit Varma]: as you described in a previous episode.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.520
[Amit Varma]: So my question is that, doesn't this lead to moral hazard,

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.200
[Amit Varma]: where you're basically privatizing profits, socializing losses,

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.720
[Amit Varma]: and therefore any big financial firm or bank can just say that,

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.920
[Amit Varma]: hey, I'll do whatever, I'll gamble with my money.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:31.040
[Amit Varma]: If I win, I keep it. If I lose, the government's bailed me out.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.680
[Guest]: There's no question that there is a threat of moral hazard.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.720
[Guest]: But let me first show the problem in its most extreme form.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.960
[Guest]: And then let's think about what governments have done

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.640
[Guest]: and how you would do things differently.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.160
[Guest]: Here's the most extreme form.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.160
[Guest]: I'm a trader working in a bank.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:54.880
[Guest]: I am given a million dollar bonus if I make a lot of money.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.080
[Guest]: Okay, so the game is well understood to me

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.600
[Guest]: that if I make $5 million in profit this year,

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.360
[Guest]: I will be given a bonus of $1 million.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.160
[Guest]: What is the incentive of the trader?

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.520
[Guest]: The incentive of the trader is to make a Hail Mary pass,

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.120
[Guest]: to take very, very, very high risk.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.920
[Guest]: If it works great, I make my organization a lot of money

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.880
[Guest]: and I make a million dollar bonus.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.800
[Guest]: If the trade doesn't work out, how bad does it get?

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.880
[Guest]: I lose my job. That's not so bad.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.440
[Guest]: Okay, so there's a fundamental incentive

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.320
[Guest]: of employees of financial firms to roll the dice.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.160
[Guest]: And that's what microprudential regulation is all about,

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.520
[Guest]: to limit the risks taken by the financial firms.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.960
[Guest]: And the moment I have said this,

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.520
[Guest]: you will shake your head in unhappiness

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.200
[Guest]: that do you really expect officials of some government agency

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.360
[Guest]: to understand the richness and complexity of the risks

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:51.280
[Guest]: that are taken by the employees of some private financial firm

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.360
[Guest]: and really be able to limit that risk?

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.360
[Guest]: So microprudential regulation is hard.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.840
[Guest]: Okay, and this is the battle that we are placed in,

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.120
[Guest]: that the basic incentive of private financial firms

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.480
[Guest]: is to take a large risk.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.680
[Guest]: Now, there are structures that will do it better than others.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.360
[Guest]: For example, I think it's always better

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.600
[Guest]: if you and I as individuals are traders,

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.480
[Guest]: because it's my risk.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.760
[Guest]: I've internalized that risk.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.360
[Guest]: I'm not part of a corporation.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.800
[Guest]: This is why I always favor

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.000
[Guest]: more direct individual participation in markets.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.760
[Guest]: Because once you get into institutions,

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.360
[Guest]: it becomes more complicated.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.320
[Guest]: Then structures like hedge funds are fundamentally better

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.120
[Guest]: because the returns are aligned

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.360
[Guest]: with the performance that investors get.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.920
[Guest]: And structures like banks are the most dangerous

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.840
[Guest]: because there is a balance sheet

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.200
[Guest]: and there's a lot of leverage.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.880
[Guest]: And this is where you get the most trouble.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.600
[Guest]: Now, when the government fails

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.600
[Guest]: on its microprudential regulation

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.840
[Guest]: or when the government fails on its systemic risk reduction,

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.200
[Guest]: you can get some big messes.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.400
[Guest]: Exposed, many of us feel very uncomfortable

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.160
[Guest]: about bailouts by the government.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.760
[Guest]: Okay, it is the clear use of taxpayer money

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:04.400
[Guest]: to clean up for the bad things done by fat cats

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.640
[Guest]: who have been buying yachts and private planes.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.080
[Guest]: Okay, the injustice of this is palpable

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.240
[Guest]: and there is no way to gloss over it.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.840
[Guest]: I just want to say to you that from the other side,

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.960
[Guest]: nobody feels differently.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:24.000
[Guest]: So I worked on the cleanup after the UTI crisis in India.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.520
[Guest]: And I've had extensive conversations

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.320
[Guest]: with some of the people who worked in the United States

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.400
[Guest]: in fixing things after the global crisis.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.920
[Guest]: There's not a single person there

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.800
[Guest]: who has the slightest attraction

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.240
[Guest]: with bailing out the fat cats.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.200
[Guest]: The point is that the alternative was worse.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:47.040
[Guest]: So I am persuaded that if the AIG

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.320
[Guest]: and other bailouts had not happened in the United States,

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.320
[Guest]: at the cost of a lot of money to the taxpayer in the short run,

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.160
[Guest]: the alternative would have been worse.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.200
[Guest]: And in the United States,

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.680
[Guest]: a lot of that money eventually came back.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.280
[Guest]: So in India's case also,

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.800
[Guest]: the public money that went into solving the UTI problem,

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.400
[Guest]: it eventually came back with interest.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.320
[Guest]: So the government made good

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.960
[Guest]: and in fact made a profit on the UTI rescue.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.360
[Guest]: So it's not that obvious exposed

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.880
[Guest]: that a lot of money was put in.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.880
[Guest]: But the point is clear in my mind,

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.680
[Guest]: on the date when these decisions were taken,

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.280
[Guest]: that the alternative was worse.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.680
[Guest]: That if you just let UTI flame out

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.360
[Guest]: without any public intervention,

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.560
[Guest]: which is closer to the sorts of things

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.960
[Guest]: that a more hot-headed person,

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.880
[Guest]: namely yours truly,

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.560
[Guest]: used to think in those days.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.000
[Guest]: Not doing anything was worse

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.840
[Guest]: than doing something using public money.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.520
[Guest]: So I'm less religious about these matters today.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.520
[Guest]: I think we should corely look at the situation

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.240
[Guest]: and we should do things that are wise and sensible,

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.720
[Guest]: even when it appears horrible.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.280
[Guest]: And there will always be the rhetoric

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.840
[Guest]: that the fat cats have their yachts

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.160
[Guest]: and you're using precious taxpayer money

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.520
[Guest]: to cover up for their mistakes.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.200
[Guest]: There is no running away from that rhetoric

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.480
[Guest]: and we have to think sensibly despite that.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I look at the sort of the marketplace of things

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.760
[Amit Varma]: as it were.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.360
[Amit Varma]: And the whole idea is that companies

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.160
[Amit Varma]: which make mistakes,

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.640
[Amit Varma]: for example, companies which set bad incentives

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.160
[Amit Varma]: for their employees,

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.240
[Amit Varma]: like the financial firm as an analogy,

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.680
[Amit Varma]: which might set a bad incentive

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.520
[Amit Varma]: for the trader to get his million dollar bonus.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.840
[Amit Varma]: When companies in the marketplace of things

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.800
[Amit Varma]: make mistakes like that,

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.240
[Amit Varma]: they suffer for it in the balance sheet.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.160
[Amit Varma]: They shut down, they're allowed to shut down.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.520
[Amit Varma]: And that's a lesson for everybody.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.000
[Amit Varma]: And that's how good practices creep into the thing.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.720
[Amit Varma]: But your point is that there is so much at stake

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.640
[Amit Varma]: in this bigger world of finance

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.120
[Amit Varma]: that sometimes you have to bail these guys out.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.720
[Amit Varma]: And the problem of moral hazard,

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.960
[Amit Varma]: therefore, is ever present.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.800
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, this could just be a cycle.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.680
[Guest]: It could happen again.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.880
[Guest]: Yes, it will happen again.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.400
[Guest]: It will assuredly happen again.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.840
[Guest]: First, I want to say that,

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.760
[Guest]: please do not underestimate the damage

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.400
[Guest]: that was caused to the shareholders of AIG,

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.920
[Guest]: to the top managers of AIG,

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.960
[Guest]: they were wiped out.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.200
[Guest]: Okay, so it's not as if

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.200
[Guest]: they are directly getting money.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.480
[Guest]: The more complex thing is

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.080
[Guest]: they made a bonus the previous year.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.000
[Guest]: Okay, so for the previous 10 years,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.160
[Guest]: they had taken home fabulous bonuses.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.440
[Guest]: They were buying islands in the Bahamas.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.040
[Amit Varma]: And nobody can change that.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:09.920
[Amit Varma]: Privatized profits,

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.440
[Amit Varma]: and they knew the losses would be socialized.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:16.000
[Guest]: So when AIG got public money,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.840
[Guest]: the existing shareholders were wiped out,

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.200
[Guest]: much like a bankruptcy process.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:19.680
[Guest]: Sure.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.600
[Guest]: Now, the reason why the world of things

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.040
[Guest]: is different from the world of finance

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.400
[Guest]: is exactly where we started.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.840
[Guest]: That finance is the brain of the economy.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.240
[Guest]: So the amount of damage that you can do

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.480
[Guest]: by destroying the financial firms is extreme.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.240
[Guest]: So I said that

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.840
[Guest]: if there was a giant earthquake in Bombay

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.280
[Guest]: and everything was destroyed,

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.320
[Guest]: where would you start?

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.080
[Guest]: You would start by rebuilding the financial sector.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.360
[Guest]: Now, let me flip this around.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.120
[Guest]: Let me leave the rest of Bombay intact.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.040
[Guest]: And let me destroy all the financial firms.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.960
[Guest]: Let me destroy the financial markets.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.160
[Guest]: That would be a catastrophe.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.840
[Guest]: The world of things would not work

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.440
[Guest]: if the world of finance was not there.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.680
[Guest]: So because finance is so important,

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.600
[Guest]: a disruption of the financial system

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.520
[Guest]: is disproportionately important,

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.640
[Guest]: and it does damage.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.640
[Guest]: So there is a really bad problem

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.680
[Guest]: in what you're describing,

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.720
[Guest]: and you are absolutely correct to highlight it.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.200
[Guest]: It's a tough thing that we will need to confront.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.600
[Guest]: So my good word will be,

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.160
[Guest]: can we do better on microprudential regulation?

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.880
[Guest]: Can we do better on systemic risk management?

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.200
[Guest]: So that these things don't happen to us.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.280
[Guest]: And I think there's a lot of headroom

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.040
[Guest]: for us in India to do these things.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.920
[Guest]: That said, yes, I feel pretty certain

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.960
[Guest]: that in the next 20 years,

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:29.920
[Guest]: we will have one more mess.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.440
[Amit Varma]: Why do you say that?

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.520
[Guest]: Because it is in the nature of finance

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.720
[Guest]: for these things to happen.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.080
[Guest]: Let me say this in a somewhat more sophisticated way.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.800
[Guest]: I said that there is a trader in a financial firm

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.640
[Guest]: and the boss of the trader

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.480
[Guest]: or the regulator of the bank

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.920
[Guest]: is trying to control the risk

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.880
[Guest]: that this guy is taking.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.440
[Guest]: But that trader is sitting at the desk

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.880
[Guest]: and thinking day and night.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.480
[Guest]: The trader will always find

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.960
[Guest]: that complicated oddball position

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.240
[Guest]: that can be taken,

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.480
[Guest]: where the risk as calculated

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.440
[Guest]: by his boss or his regulator will be wrong.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.720
[Guest]: So the world is a complicated place.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.160
[Guest]: No models are perfect.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.280
[Guest]: Every attempt by a regulator or by a management

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.720
[Guest]: to measure and control the risk

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.280
[Guest]: that is being taken by the decision makers.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.920
[Guest]: These attempts will always be crude.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.000
[Guest]: And the moment you put in a system,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.920
[Guest]: the moment you put in a risk system,

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.440
[Guest]: there are very, very smart people

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.360
[Guest]: who are trying to find the chinks

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.800
[Guest]: of that risk system.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.920
[Guest]: And the world will change

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.600
[Guest]: and there will be opportunities

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.280
[Guest]: to load up on risk in ways

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.440
[Guest]: that your risk model does not quite see.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.200
[Guest]: And then the cycle will start all over again.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.880
[Guest]: So it's just in the nature of the world

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.160
[Guest]: that the world will change.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.920
[Guest]: The class of instruments will change.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.360
[Guest]: Every risk system is limited.

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.480
[Guest]: We will have a mess

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.280
[Guest]: and then we'll clean up

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.320
[Guest]: and we'll start over.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.640
[Amit Varma]: So now you're someone who's known

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.720
[Amit Varma]: the Indian financial system intimately,

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.480
[Amit Varma]: both as part of the establishment

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.760
[Amit Varma]: and as a reformer

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.120
[Amit Varma]: and perhaps as a player.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.800
[Amit Varma]: So in your view, very broadly,

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.120
[Amit Varma]: what is wrong with the Indian financial system today?

00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.440
[Guest]: In India, we started at a legacy

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.920
[Guest]: of a 1934 RBI Act.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.720
[Guest]: When the British created that act

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.320
[Guest]: in a remarkable act of honesty,

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.000
[Guest]: in the first two sentences of the law,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.640
[Guest]: they said that as a temporary measure,

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.160
[Guest]: we create the Reserve Bank of India.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.920
[Guest]: Okay, so this is not a structure

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.920
[Guest]: that was intended to be a thorough,

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:18.960
[Guest]: well thought out thing.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.160
[Guest]: And it has taken many, many years.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.640
[Guest]: So we started with that temporary structure

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.480
[Guest]: in the years of Indian socialism.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.320
[Guest]: We built an entire financial system

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.840
[Guest]: around central planning.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.680
[Guest]: So the idea was that the planning commission

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.600
[Guest]: would decide there needs to be a steel mill

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.240
[Guest]: and the financial system will serve up

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.320
[Guest]: the money required to build that steel mill.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.280
[Guest]: That's our legacy.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.640
[Guest]: That's where we started.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.800
[Guest]: We started getting some new organizations

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.440
[Guest]: like SEBI,

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.520
[Guest]: but in the 90s,

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.400
[Guest]: when the DNA of the organization was laid,

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.680
[Guest]: we did not know a whole lot

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.800
[Guest]: about how to create the processes

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.040
[Guest]: and the checks and balances

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.880
[Guest]: of these organizations.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.840
[Guest]: I think only in the last five, 10 years,

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.280
[Guest]: we've developed a good understanding

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.280
[Guest]: about what is to be done.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.000
[Guest]: I check pointed the four things to you.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.360
[Guest]: We need to do consumer protection,

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:08.880
[Guest]: microprudential regulation,

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.360
[Guest]: resolution and systemic risk.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.480
[Guest]: This clarity is only last five, 10 years.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.200
[Guest]: And we also have a lot of clarity

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.400
[Guest]: on how a regulator should work,

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.240
[Guest]: how to create checks and balances,

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.160
[Guest]: how to prevent arbitrary power,

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.240
[Guest]: how to prevent arbitrary persecution

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.840
[Guest]: by a regulator.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.240
[Guest]: These are things that we've only started understanding

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.680
[Guest]: in the last five, 10 years.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.680
[Guest]: So I think only now we're coming to the point

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.840
[Guest]: where we have a reasonable understanding

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.720
[Guest]: of what is the task of financial regulation

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.360
[Guest]: and what is the kind of organizational design

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.320
[Guest]: and law and public administration

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.600
[Guest]: that will take us towards state capability,

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.160
[Guest]: state capacity in doing this kind of work.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.440
[Guest]: And in the meantime,

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.520
[Guest]: there are these incumbents in the landscape.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.760
[Guest]: There are public sector firms in the landscape.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.520
[Guest]: So there will be resistance.

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.440
[Guest]: So I see a long, slow journey

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.680
[Guest]: of building the state capability

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.480
[Guest]: to do the right things

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.080
[Guest]: and not do the central planning.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.000
[Amit Varma]: What are the big specific reforms

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:10.800
[Amit Varma]: you'd carry out

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.280
[Amit Varma]: if you were in charge of the finance ministry tomorrow?

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:17.200
[Guest]: I was a bit player in a very important project

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.760
[Guest]: that was begun in 2011.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.760
[Guest]: It is called the Financial Sector

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.760
[Guest]: Legislative Reforms Commission.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.000
[Guest]: And this blueprint was set up there.

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.160
[Guest]: This commission was led by Justice Shri Krishna.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.800
[Guest]: And the report was submitted in 2013

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.360
[Guest]: and the work was completed in 2015.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.800
[Guest]: It's a single clean law.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.400
[Guest]: It's called the Indian Financial Code.

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.480
[Guest]: And in my mind,

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.120
[Guest]: that's a very important reform to enact this law.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:46.240
[Guest]: It replaces 61 existing laws.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.320
[Guest]: And then there would be several years of work

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.880
[Guest]: on building the agency architecture

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.200
[Guest]: that would be able to enforce this law.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.080
[Amit Varma]: Is it online somewhere

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.520
[Amit Varma]: where I can link it from episode page?

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.560
[Amit Varma]: Great, I'll do that.

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.240

[Unknown]: Janice, what do you think couples did before TV was invented?

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.680
[Unknown]: I don't know, go for walks on the beach, long drives,

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.480
[Unknown]: fancy dinners, have more sex maybe.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.760
[Unknown]: But what did we do when we decided to move in together?

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:31.360
[Unknown]: We debated between the Chromecast and the Fire Stick.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.600
[Unknown]: We gave up on sleeping early so we could stay up

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.360
[Unknown]: watching true crime shows.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.120
[Unknown]: We got ourselves three cat babies.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.560
[Unknown]: And basically became the cutest couch potatoes around.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:41.060
[Unknown]: Okay then.
