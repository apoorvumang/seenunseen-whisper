00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.640
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.560
[Amit Varma]: criminals actually have a better statistical chance than non-criminals of getting elected.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.240
[Amit Varma]: I found this out from a fascinating book called When Crime Pays by the brilliant political

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.400
[Amit Varma]: scientist Milan Vaishnav. Milan is a director of and senior fellow at the South Asia Program

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.880
[Amit Varma]: of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He is also the host of a superb podcast,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.240
[Amit Varma]: The Grand Tamasha, which is co-produced by the Carnegie Endowment and the Hindustan Times

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.840
[Amit Varma]: and focuses, as the name indicates, on these general elections. It will be linked from

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.360
[Amit Varma]: the episode page for this episode. Before I begin my conversation with Milan though,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.960
[Amit Varma]: let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.000
[Amit Varma]: This episode of the scene in the unseen is brought to you by Storytel. Storytel is an

[Amit Varma]: audiobook platform which you can listen to on your Android or iOS app. They have thousands

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.560
[Amit Varma]: with a single L, mind you. I actually use Storytel myself regularly, so as long as they

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.720
[Amit Varma]: sponsor the show, I'm going to recommend one book a week that I love, since my guest today

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.360
[Amit Varma]: is named Milan. My recommendation today is by an author named Milan. Milan Kundera is

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.800
[Amit Varma]: one of my favorite 20th century novelists, and one of his best books is available on

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.120
[Amit Varma]: Storytel, The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Kundera's books stay with you long after you

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.560
[Amit Varma]: finish reading them, and in this case, the movie based on the book is one of my favorite

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.200
[Amit Varma]: film adaptations. The Unbearable Lightness of Being, the movie, was made in the 1980s,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.920
[Amit Varma]: directed by Philip Kaufman and starred Daniel Day-Lewis, Lena Olin, and the gorgeous Juliet

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.420
[Amit Varma]: Binoche, my childhood crush. But read the book first, only on Storytel, and remember

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.560
[Amit Varma]: you get a 30-day free trial if you go to Storytel.com slash IVM, remember, that's Storytel with

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.560
[Amit Varma]: a single L. Thank you.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.280
[Amit Varma]: Milan, welcome to the scene in the unseen. Thanks for having me. Before we get to the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.640
[Amit Varma]: subject of this episode, you're doing this awesome political podcast with the Hindustan

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.400
[Amit Varma]: Times. So why don't you tell us a little bit about these elections? What's what's happening?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.200
[Guest]: Who's gonna win? Small question. So I think things look very different today than they

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.360
[Amit Varma]: did even at the start of 2019. And we are recording this, by the way, on March 18. This

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.000
[Amit Varma]: episode is going to be released on April 1. So a lot could have changed. Kindly don't

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.960
[Guest]: hold Milan responsible for anything.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.520
[Guest]: That's right. Hopefully everyone will forget by the time May 23 comes around and we've

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:00.640
[Guest]: counted votes. I think that the momentum is shifted quite significantly towards Modi and

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.800
[Guest]: the BJP. And it's not only because of the events at Pulwama and the aftermath, although

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.040
[Guest]: I do think that that was a net positive for him. But I think as we've moved towards the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:20.960
[Guest]: main campaign, Modi's attributes, his claim to fame, decisiveness, leadership, nationalism

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.960
[Guest]: have come to the fore. And here I think we see the opposition's weaknesses in terms of

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:35.280
[Guest]: both coming up and answering the leadership question, but also, you know, trying to articulate

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.400
[Guest]: a cogent counter narrative to what Modi and the BJP have to offer. And I think for many

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.320
[Guest]: Indians when they look at the opposition, a lot of their charges seem rather petty.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.720
[Guest]: Because I think in the most parts of this country, certainly in North India, maybe less

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.720
[Guest]: so in South India, Modi is popular. You know, people like him. People would like to believe

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.440
[Guest]: that he has their best interests at heart, that he has clean intent. So they're willing

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:12.800
[Guest]: to forgive quite a lot of policy missteps, whether it's, you know, GST, demonetization,

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.880
[Guest]: you know, various other grievances with respect to the economy, and instead focus on the positive.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.840
[Guest]: So I think what the recent Balakot strike does is to give people who are hunting for

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.880
[Guest]: an excuse to support Modi, give them a reason to vote for him on election day.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.440
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, I am a Namche commentator based in a city. So whenever someone asks me, what

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.640
[Amit Varma]: do you think is going to happen in the election, my honest answer has to be listen, I don't

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.160
[Amit Varma]: have a clue, because it's just so many, it's a conglomeration of local elections, you know,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.920
[Amit Varma]: there are so many factors in play. And it's incredibly hard for someone like me to have

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.000
[Amit Varma]: a sense and to leave my biases aside. But as a political scientist, you're obviously

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.160
[Amit Varma]: looking beyond all of that. And you're trying, you know, you have, what's the kind of data

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.560
[Amit Varma]: you look at? What are the kind of trends that you look at to try to get a sense of what

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.640
[Guest]: is really happening in the country?

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:09.360
[Guest]: So, you know, obviously, there are huge questions around the validity and accuracy of survey

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.520
[Guest]: data. Because we have too many instances in the past where surveys have sort of gotten

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.040
[Guest]: things wrong, both in terms of vote share and in terms of seat share. But I think the

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.820
[Guest]: way in which one can look at survey data is to sort of look at trends, because they do

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.560
[Guest]: tend to be kind of correlated with one another. So you could see very clearly, from, say,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.320
[Guest]: the height of the BJP's power post-Luther British, to where we are today, definitely

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.560
[Guest]: a sort of narrowing of the race. And then more recently, again, a widening, and I think

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.480
[Guest]: I expect that widening will either grow or kind of stay the same, barring, you know,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.280
[Guest]: major unforeseen events in the next couple of weeks. So I think that's one. I mean, I

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.280
[Guest]: think the second is trying to go beyond the sort of horse race of, you know, this leader

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.860
[Guest]: said X and the other leader said Y. But look at some of the underlying trends, whether

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.660
[Guest]: it's with young voters or female voters, their participation, what they're saying matters

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.660
[Guest]: to them.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.760
[Guest]: You know, for instance, one of the striking things about 2014 that we were able to detect

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.000
[Guest]: pre-election, not that we had foreseen a single party majority of the size, I don't want to

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.320
[Guest]: claim credit for that because I didn't, but that there was a surprising convergence in

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.100
[Guest]: priorities among rural and urban dwellers. They both were saying the exact same things

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:39.160
[Guest]: mattered to them. The top three issues in both types of places were price rise, lack

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:45.640
[Guest]: of sort of development jobs, and corruption. Now, the precise ordering of those three questions

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:51.440
[Guest]: might vary from Telenado to, you know, Bihar, but they were always the top three issues,

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.840
[Amit Varma]: both in urban and in rural.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And there are people who sort of say that, you know, for example, just to pick one of

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.120
[Amit Varma]: those issues, which is development, that people who cited development to vote for the BJP

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.920
[Amit Varma]: were actually rationalizing or putting a respectable face to their innate bigotry or whatever the

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.320
[Amit Varma]: case might be. And they were really voting for other reasons. I mean, so how does one

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.320
[Amit Varma]: really know why are people really voting? What are the forces at play here? Because

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.560
[Amit Varma]: there are a lot of complex forces at play here, which will not show up on this kind

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.560
[Amit Varma]: of survey data, right? Because you will never see these sort of trends.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.720
[Guest]: Right. No, I mean, I think, you know, one of the major problems in survey research is

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.080
[Guest]: what social scientists call social desirability bias, right? Basically, a numerator knocks

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.080
[Guest]: on my door and asks me a bunch of questions, and I don't want him or her to judge me in

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.080
[Guest]: the wrong way. And so therefore, I sort of tell them, you know, what I think they want

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.000
[Guest]: to hear. So I think that obviously is an issue. There's ways of getting around that through

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.720
[Guest]: experimentation. You know, there's survey experiments where you sort of give people

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:59.040
[Guest]: vignettes or different kinds of prompts and see kind of what changes their thing. So some

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:04.640
[Guest]: people have tried that. I think the other thing, though, just on the economy, you know,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.800
[Guest]: I'm one of these people who believes that there has been a shift in the Indian electorate

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.760
[Guest]: that traditionally there's been this truism that good economics doesn't make for good

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:21.600
[Guest]: politics. That if you look over the vast stretch of post-independence history, particularly

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.040
[Guest]: when we have data, say, the last three, four decades, that there's no apparent correlation

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:33.760
[Guest]: between a government's economic performance and how that incumbent does at the time of

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.280
[Guest]: election. But what's interesting is if you start disaggregating that relationship by

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:44.440
[Guest]: decade, you see actually starting around the year 2000, there is much more of a close correlation.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:50.800
[Guest]: In other words, there are positive electoral rewards to better growth. Now, is this of

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.480
[Guest]: extremely robust and strong relationship? No. Can it explain all the variation? Not

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.680
[Guest]: at all. But I do think that there has been a subtle shift. You know, part of that is

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:06.440
[Guest]: once people taste the fruits of rapid growth or high growth, they start to demand more.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.440
[Guest]: So you know, one of the puzzling things about this election, if Modi and the BJP come back

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:16.280
[Guest]: to power, is clearly growth has been very uneven. And so what were the other factors

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.680
[Guest]: that were shaping the electorate in this race beyond just sort of bread and butter issues

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.920
[Guest]: like growth, jobs, inflation, and so on?

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.160
[Amit Varma]: Siddharth Tavakoli And I think the other, just to sort of add

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.800
[Amit Varma]: to that, even if there are more people in the electorate who are claiming a concern

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.760
[Amit Varma]: for economic issues, that doesn't necessarily mean that they'll promote the right kind of

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.760
[Amit Varma]: policies. For example, if you ask a farmer today, what do you want most? Do you want

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.600
[Amit Varma]: a Hindu Rashtra? He'll probably say, no, no, man, I just, you know, do something about

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.120
[Amit Varma]: the economics. I want development. But what he has in mind is farm loan waivers, which

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:53.360
[Amit Varma]: are just a short term fix, and not any of the structural reforms that we actually need.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.720
[Guest]: So you know, I think, I mean, this is very relevant to the current Prime Minister, because

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:06.020
[Guest]: in 2014, you know, Modi became something of a Rorschach test. We all sort of projected

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:12.880
[Guest]: onto him what we wanted to see, right? So some people saw the Hindu strongman of 2002.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:20.160
[Guest]: Other people saw kind of a more market friendly, libertarian minded, you know, kind of modernizer.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.920
[Guest]: And in reality, we've sort of got, I think, something that's closer to the middle. But

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:30.640
[Guest]: you know, he was very careful in the run up to the 2014 polls, of not really saying all

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:37.240
[Guest]: that much, in terms of specific policy, right? It was subcassades, because it was good governance,

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:44.120
[Guest]: it was rejuvenating the Indian economy, right, making India kind of a world leader on the

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.920
[Guest]: global stage, once again, I mean, these were sort of platitudes. And then I think we all

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.920
[Guest]: filled in the blanks with the kind of policy menus that we hoped he would sort of pick

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.920
[Amit Varma]: up.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.680
[Amit Varma]: And now that we know that, and would you therefore say that if your contention is that people

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.080
[Amit Varma]: do care about economics, would you then say that maybe the Congress missed the trick a

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.680
[Amit Varma]: little bit here by focusing on Rafale, by focusing on Pulwama, and so on, when they

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.360
[Amit Varma]: should perhaps just have been talking jobs, jobs, jobs, where are the jobs?

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.800
[Guest]: One of the most enduring mysteries about this campaign cycle is why the Congress has not

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:24.160
[Guest]: just done that. In my personal view, I think they've wasted a lot of time with the Rafale

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:30.560
[Guest]: scandal, because I think frankly, outside of a small coterie of people in urban metros,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.440
[Guest]: not that many people are either going to care, or are going to be able to understand what

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.940
[Guest]: the deal is about. You know, we were talking about this before, if you asked a veteran

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:46.160
[Guest]: defense expert to give you a 15 second soundbite on Rafale, I think he or she would really

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.240
[Guest]: struggle. And so I fear that for the Congress, they're also falling into the same trap now

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.460
[Guest]: with this Pulwama thing, talking about China, how is this government not able to get China

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:03.480
[Guest]: to vote in the UN Security Council to sanction Masoud Azhar, the head of Jaish-e-Mohammed,

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:11.760
[Guest]: criticizing Ajit Doval for his hand in getting Masoud Azhar back as part of the hostage exchange.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.760
[Guest]: These are losers in terms of issues for the Congress, I think that they should instead

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:23.840
[Guest]: focus and Priyanka Gandhi did this in Ahmedabad the other day, talking about jobs, agrarian

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.240
[Guest]: distress and so on and so forth. But it may be too little too late. And I think the other

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.760
[Guest]: thing that is hurting the Congress is, they don't seem to be able to articulate a kind

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:40.440
[Guest]: of alternative future. So what is it that they would do if they came to power? So we

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:47.280
[Guest]: see some strands of ideas, you know, more loan waivers, a better income support scheme.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:53.720
[Guest]: But I think a lot of folks have sort of lost confidence that on the ideas front anyway,

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.600
[Guest]: they have a clear sense of, you know, what they would do if they came to power.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.080
[Amit Varma]: Dr. Ahmed Sabir Let's kind of move on from talking about

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:06.040
[Amit Varma]: these elections to a subject that actually, you know, affects all the parties where all

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.120
[Amit Varma]: the parties are really equally guilty, which is crime and politics, you know, as your book

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.680
[Amit Varma]: describes in such detail, you know, criminality in politics is not restricted to this party

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:20.880
[Amit Varma]: or that party, despite all the noises that Modi made in 2014. The BJP is as guilty of

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.560
[Amit Varma]: it as anyone. And interestingly, people seem to think it's a problem in the Hindi heartland.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.200
[Amit Varma]: But as your book shows, it's spread out all across the country. And it's got deep structural

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:37.920
[Amit Varma]: reasons. And I found all of that very fascinating. And I was quite taken with your approach to

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:44.160
[Amit Varma]: handling this issue, which was to think of Indian politics in terms of markets to talk

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.800
[Amit Varma]: about the political marketplace and examine the incentives within that marketplace. And

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.880
[Amit Varma]: then from there, figure out why we are where we are. So how did you sort of, you know,

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.520
[Amit Varma]: arrive at that approach, that way of looking at this problem?

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.600
[Guest]: Dr. Ahmed Sabir So, you know, I went in, very influenced by

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.440
[Guest]: what the global literature says. And if I had to summarize the prevailing wisdom in

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:14.280
[Guest]: the political economy literature, it's basically about information, that where voters lack

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:19.560
[Guest]: adequate information about the candidates they're voting for, they are liable to choose

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:25.080
[Guest]: quote unquote, bad candidates, bad meaning corrupt, dishonest, tainted, criminal in some

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:31.480
[Guest]: way. And so if you just give them that information, they're able to update their calculation and

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.160
[Guest]: choose quote unquote, good politicians who are the kind of honest or non criminals. And

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:43.720
[Guest]: so I had begun to spend some time with voters and political campaigns in India. And what

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:50.600
[Guest]: I quickly realized is that wasn't the story. Many people were voting for these criminals,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.600
[Guest]: and they had this information. But there was another reason they were doing so. And so

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.420
[Guest]: then I started to think about this question of the demand, where does the demand for this

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.980
[Guest]: kind of a figure, whether it's a Papu Yadav or an Anand Singh or some of the people I

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:09.840
[Guest]: talk about in my book? And where do these people come from? Right? I mean, at the end

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.100
[Guest]: of the day, it's parties who are giving them tickets. It's not you know, if you're an independent

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.840
[Guest]: in this country, it's very, very hard to win elections. I mean, the independents historically

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.280
[Guest]: have performed very, very poorly. And so that's really how I backed into this demand supply

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.200
[Guest]: framework. And then I sort of thought, you know, let's try to it's almost like an onion

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.920
[Guest]: that you're peeling the layers successively, you know, to try to get at the core of the

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:40.180
[Guest]: story. But you know, I came in at thinking I knew what the answer was only to be very

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:46.920
[Guest]: quickly proven wrong. And that put me at odds with what other people, you know, in the academy

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:54.520
[Guest]: were sort of saying, but I thought it was rather unfair to transpose, you know, all

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.920
[Guest]: the work that had been done in other countries and just say, well, you know, India probably

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.920
[Guest]: is the same.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:03.400
[Amit Varma]: No, and it's it's struck me while reading it that it's a very fine work of public choice

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.280
[Amit Varma]: economics and you're a trained political scientist. So let's take a detour for a moment because

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.080
[Amit Varma]: I meant to ask you about this. Tell me a little bit about, you know, how you became a political

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.240
[Amit Varma]: scientist and what are the kind of things you studied for this?

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:23.760
[Guest]: Sure. So I studied politics and economics as an undergraduate in the US. And I didn't

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.440
[Guest]: really know that you could make a career out of that. I just thought, you know, I'm interested,

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:34.040
[Guest]: this is sort of a hobby. And I ended up spending a summer interning at the Pentagon. And so

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.740
[Guest]: my eyes were open to the different kinds of careers one could have. And then I stayed

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:43.440
[Guest]: on for an additional semester and worked at a think tank. And so when I graduated, I was

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.520
[Guest]: sort of bitten by the bug. I knew I wanted to come back. So I sort of, you know, worked

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.940
[Guest]: the trenches as very lowly research assistant at a series of think tanks. But no think tanks

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.760
[Guest]: and research institutes are a funny place. So there's a real caste system. You know,

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:01.460
[Guest]: you're either the lowly researcher assistant, or you're a fellow or a senior fellow carrying

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.460
[Guest]: out your research.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.460
[Amit Varma]: There's no middle class.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:08.360
[Guest]: There's no middle class and there's no social mobility. So I decided, you know, by default,

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:13.440
[Guest]: I basically if I wanted to kind of jump ranks, I was going to have to go do a PhD. And so

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.680
[Guest]: I decided to do a PhD in political science. But funnily enough, up until this point in

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:26.120
[Guest]: time, I had never worked on India. As an Indian American, as the son of Indian immigrants,

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:31.760
[Guest]: my natural reaction was to do the exact opposite of whatever my culture or family was. And

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.000
[Guest]: so for years and years and years, I thought who would want to do India? It's not exotic

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.480
[Guest]: enough. You know, I know it already. Of course, none of those things were true. And I think

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:46.240
[Guest]: it wasn't until I got to graduate school, when I started to realize that, A, there's

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.240
[Guest]: so much we don't know about India. B, that's a place where you can really make a contribution.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.800
[Guest]: And C, you know, PhDs are six or seven years long in the States if you're doing political

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.600
[Guest]: science. So this has to be something that is going to be both personally and professionally

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.120
[Guest]: rewarding to you. And the light bulb just sort of went off and India kind of floated

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:11.440
[Guest]: to the top. And so I spent a summer here in New Delhi working at CSDS, you know, who are

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.920
[Guest]: the ones who do regular polling. And I'd never look back.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:22.960
[Amit Varma]: Right. And getting back to the book, When Crime Pays, so you essentially ask five questions

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.440
[Amit Varma]: in the book to try and figure out why our politics is so infested with crime. And, and

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.400
[Amit Varma]: of course, the first three have to deal with incentives, which is, you know, the first

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:36.560
[Amit Varma]: one is, why do criminals gravitate towards politics in the first place? The second is,

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:43.840
[Amit Varma]: why do parties choose to have criminal candidates? And the third is, why do voters vote for criminal

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.480
[Amit Varma]: candidates, even when they know that they're criminals? In fact, like you point out that

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.400
[Amit Varma]: it's often a feature, not a bug, that they're voting for these guys because of their criminal

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.840
[Amit Varma]: backgrounds and not in spite of it. So let's kind of get to the first of those questions,

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.440
[Amit Varma]: which is, what are the incentives for criminals to get into politics? And you know, as you

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.800
[Amit Varma]: kind of pointed out in your book that it wasn't always like this, that perhaps up to the 70s,

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.080
[Amit Varma]: criminals played a kind of a side role where they would help politicians, they would do

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:16.160
[Amit Varma]: booth capturing or mobilize voters and stuff like that. But at some point, something fundamentally

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:21.040
[Amit Varma]: shifts in the political landscape that prompts them to make the move themselves. Tell me

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.040
[Guest]: about this.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:27.680
[Guest]: That's right. So if you go back and read the earliest reports of elections in 1952, in

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:34.320
[Guest]: the early 50s, you see in the Election Commission's official reports, you know, scattered mentions

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:41.840
[Guest]: of the use of kind of gundas on the part of politicians and political parties to suppress

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.720
[Guest]: voters, if you think they're going to vote against you to mobilize voters to capture

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:53.240
[Guest]: boots to kind of do the dirty work of politicians. And that starts to increase, it's pioneered

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.820
[Guest]: by the Congress, and then people start to sort of copycat what the Congress is doing.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.960
[Guest]: But they're very much at the periphery of politics. They are not the candidates, they

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.440
[Guest]: are sort of the hired guns. And the quid pro quo there is, look, if we come to power, we'll

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:11.280
[Guest]: protect you. But you've got to do this, you know, for us. So the incentives were totally

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:18.040
[Guest]: compatible. Several things started to change slowly over time at first. One is that you

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:23.480
[Guest]: start to see the rise of identity politics. And so some of these cast expressions get

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:29.400
[Guest]: mobilized and activated. And these gundas are forms of that expression. By and large,

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:35.080
[Guest]: a lot of the politicians were still from the Hindu upper castes. Number two is you start

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:41.360
[Guest]: to see a hollowing out of the state apparatus, particularly the law and order institutions.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.540
[Guest]: And money becomes more important as the population is growing and candidates are trying to sort

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:53.320
[Guest]: of woo voters. But where you really see this kind of critical break is around the Indira's

00:21:53.320 --> 00:22:00.280
[Guest]: time in the 1970s, where at that point, two things happen. One is that the Congress system

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:05.480
[Guest]: starts to collapse under the weight of its own contradictions, which then opens up political

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.200
[Guest]: space for these political entrepreneurs to rush in and grab a piece of that.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.200
[Guest]: Sadanand Rajan What's the Congress system?

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.480
[Guest]: Matthew 15 So the Congress system essentially was, you

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:22.480
[Guest]: know, this very cultivated sense of a system of sort of patronage and clientelism overseen

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:29.480
[Guest]: by the Congress, which, you know, meant that the Congress had reasonably good local party

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:35.600
[Guest]: organizations and political networks. Over time, as Indira begins to centralize more

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:43.020
[Guest]: power in her own hands, some of these networks start to atrophy. Now, there's an underlying

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:49.760
[Guest]: weakness already generating because again, as I said, the Congress claimed to represent

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.640
[Guest]: everybody. But in fact, if you look at who the politicians were, who actually were on

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:58.040
[Guest]: the ballots got elected, it tended to be from a relatively thin band of society. So there's

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:04.400
[Guest]: already some sort of disenchantment. And a lot of these criminal entrepreneurs realized

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.160
[Guest]: that over the years, they had accumulated resources, they could accumulate black money,

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:16.000
[Guest]: and they knew how to move it around, that they became the mediators between the state

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.800
[Guest]: and society. But yet they weren't getting any of the credit, they weren't getting the

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.520
[Guest]: financial rents necessarily, because the politicians were taking their cut. They weren't getting

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.600
[Guest]: the ego rents or the psychological rents, because at the end of the day, they were just,

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.320
[Guest]: you know, the kind of hired gun. And so they decided in the book, I use the kind of analogy

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:38.320
[Guest]: of, you know, vertical integration, right? So when a manufacturer decides that, you know,

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.660
[Guest]: I'm building cars, I should take advantage of economies of scale and start to manufacture

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:48.560
[Guest]: my own tires, criminals essentially started to do that. So you start to see particularly

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:54.720
[Guest]: in the 1970s, in the post emergency time, criminals themselves directly standing for

00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:00.680
[Guest]: election, you know, and they say things like, look, everyone was coming, paying their respects

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:06.480
[Guest]: to the politician, and we were getting nothing, but they rely on us. So why don't we just

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.320
[Guest]: cut out the middleman and just and just sort of do it ourselves. And so that system starts

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:17.000
[Guest]: to rapidly escalate. And one of the things that Indira Gandhi did, which now when we

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:25.880
[Guest]: look back, was extremely harmful to India's political economy, is she she banned corporate

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.240
[Guest]: donations to political parties. Now, that sounds to some people may be like a good thing.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.360
[Guest]: But essentially, what it did is then shifted all political funding underground, and she

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:40.800
[Guest]: never replaced it with something else. In Europe, they've replaced it with the public

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:46.560
[Guest]: financing system. And so then there really was a premium on how do you aggregate and

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.440
[Guest]: move this black money and criminals had an advantage there. And so we're still living

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:55.800
[Guest]: with the legacy of that policy decision. As you know, you know, most money which gets

00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.640
[Guest]: spent in election time is unaccounted for, right? So we have official estimates. But

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.280
[Guest]: we know that the actual numbers are probably 10x, you know, what politicians themselves

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.280
[Guest]: report if not more.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:11.160
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, another factor you mentioned while analyzing the incentives of the criminals

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.840
[Amit Varma]: themselves is the rise of anti incumbency, that it was far more common in the 50s or

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:22.440
[Amit Varma]: 60s to retain your seat. But as anti incumbency went up through the late 60s, 70s, 80s, what

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.440
[Amit Varma]: inevitably happened was that if you were a criminal don, like you talk about how the

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.760
[Amit Varma]: goondas became dada, so let's say you're a dada of your neighborhood, rather than help

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.800
[Amit Varma]: one politician and then in the next election, he goes out of power and you're on the outside

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:39.320
[Amit Varma]: again, why not just make sure you are part of the system and you stand instead and you

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.800
[Amit Varma]: make as much money as you can and all of that.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.680
[Guest]: Yeah, that's really a central characteristic. You know, when the Congress was so dominant,

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.400
[Guest]: if you were the goonda, the night before the election day, you could sort of sleep easy,

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.840
[Guest]: you could rest easy, because odds are that your Congress politician you work with is

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.880
[Guest]: going to come back to power. Once that uncertainty increases, you're in a dangerous situation,

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:08.600
[Guest]: because if that patron of yours loses, then both the state and the opposition, which knows

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:13.160
[Guest]: about your dealings with the Congress could come after you. So they essentially decided,

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:18.760
[Guest]: why don't we just take our own fate, you know, into our own hands. And that's what they decided

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:26.000
[Guest]: to do. And of course, very soon, they realized that, you know, this wasn't just politically

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.120
[Guest]: profitable, it was also economically profitable.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:32.800
[Amit Varma]: And you've got a great chapter which talks about how exactly how economically profitable

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.880
[Amit Varma]: it is, which is, you know, where you, you coined the term rents Raj, is that your term?

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:44.680
[Guest]: That's not my term. I think the rents Raj came first. Well, there was the resource Raj,

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.880
[Guest]: which is actually a term that Raghuram Rajan came up with. And the rents Raj was something

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:55.120
[Guest]: that the former chief economic advisor, Irvin Subramaniam, sort of adapted, you know, from

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.120
[Guest]: what Rajan said.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.680
[Amit Varma]: So tell me sort of about the different kinds of rents. So can you can you first define

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.680
[Amit Varma]: rent seeking for me for those of my listeners?

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:07.800
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, I think it's basically, you know, how do you make money without having

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.120
[Guest]: to do very much? And by the way, productive activity, right? I mean, so people who they

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.560
[Guest]: want a free lunch, I think that's one way of thinking about it. And so, you know, what

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:24.120
[Guest]: I talk about in the book is that, you know, you have these quite powerful changes in Indian

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:30.920
[Guest]: political economy. So you have the changing social makeup of our political class, the

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:37.120
[Guest]: enfranchised men of Dalits and backwards, and so on. You have economic changes from

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:42.380
[Guest]: a more command and control economy to a more market driven economy. Politically, of course,

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:46.800
[Guest]: you move from a one party dominant system to a more fragmented multi party system. But

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:53.300
[Guest]: the one thing which really is constant throughout, you know, post independence India is the strength

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:59.520
[Guest]: of institutions is always lagging behind those other changes that there really haven't been

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:05.920
[Guest]: too many governments who have prioritized administrative and governance reform. And so in that delta

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:11.880
[Guest]: between all of these pressures and aspirations comes in the opportunity to sort of, you know,

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:19.760
[Guest]: make rents, right. And so when you have market opening in 1991, a lot of the ability to make

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:26.160
[Guest]: money gets monopolized by people who are able to manipulate, you know, the leftovers of

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:31.160
[Guest]: the regulatory sort of regime. So in some cases, you have regulatory capture. In some

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:36.760
[Guest]: cases, you open up or you privatize, but you then don't re regulate, which is often something

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:42.840
[Guest]: that you have to do to make sure that there's not monopoly control. And so there's huge

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:48.680
[Guest]: rents from regulation. There's huge rents also from extraction, right? So the whole

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:54.480
[Guest]: topic of natural resources wasn't really something that was on the agenda in 1991. And we saw

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.840
[Guest]: the fallout from that in the UPA to government, right? I mean, all of the major scandals involved,

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:06.000
[Guest]: whether it was land, coal mining, telecommunication spectrum, which is a kind of natural resource.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.080
[Guest]: So not only do politicians wield a lot of power to trade regulation for bribes or campaign

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:18.880
[Guest]: finance, but then they can also make a lot of money through these extractive routes.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.880
[Guest]: So that was the story, you know, of a guy like Madhu Koda and Jharkhand, right? I mean,

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:27.760
[Guest]: that's essentially the game he played. But this happens at a much smaller scale as well.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:33.800
[Guest]: So I mean, the thing in Mumbai, obviously, is, you know, why do you have this labyrinthine

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.800
[Guest]: structure of licenses and permits to do anything in real estate? Well, part of the reason is

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.120
[Guest]: because the politicians and the bureaucrats who control that need to fund themselves.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.200
[Guest]: And so they're able to kind of say, look, let's do a deal, I'll give you something and

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.600
[Amit Varma]: you give me something in return.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.000
[Amit Varma]: Sadanand Anandamurthy And you kind of talk about the different,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.120
[Amit Varma]: the three different kinds of rents. And obviously, the first of those is something that is pervasive

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.840
[Amit Varma]: all through our history is probably a little more before 91, but it still exists, which

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:05.760
[Amit Varma]: is essentially regulatory rent, which, you know, I've had a bunch of episodes on different

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.200
[Amit Varma]: aspects of this, like restaurant regulation, for example, and so on. And it basically means,

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.000
[Amit Varma]: every time you're paying a bribe to get something done, you're paying a sort of regulatory rent

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.400
[Amit Varma]: or every time a business is paying a bribe to get a license, that's regulatory rent.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.880
[Amit Varma]: And that's, you know, you come to power, and you typically have a whole lot of these rents

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:28.400
[Amit Varma]: at your disposal. So you spend x amount getting to power and you can make 3x or 4x when you're

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:33.320
[Amit Varma]: in power and disperse patronage accordingly. But what's interesting is after 91, a new

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:38.960
[Amit Varma]: kind of rent explodes, which is extractive rents and where you quoted Rajan where he

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:44.040
[Amit Varma]: says that the license Raj has now become a resource Raj. And another interesting fact

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:48.100
[Amit Varma]: that I sort of found in your book was that while the number of billionaires expanded

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:55.520
[Amit Varma]: massively after 91, a significant percentage of them were in what you call rent thick sectors,

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:01.120
[Amit Varma]: which is they are in a sense benefiting from that kind of what you'd call crony socialism.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.960
[Guest]: Is that correct? That's right. I mean, so this is work that Michael Walton, who's at

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.440
[Guest]: the Kennedy School and others have done to basically track billionaires over time. Now,

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:15.320
[Guest]: there has been a rise in billionaires in many countries. But one thing you notice about

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:22.240
[Guest]: India in the post 90s period is a the number of billionaires relative to India's sort of

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:28.040
[Guest]: per capita GDP. And the second is the sectoral breakdown of where they are. They are in these

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:34.280
[Guest]: rent thick sectors. So again, things like construction, real estate, you know, petroleum,

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:40.520
[Guest]: oil and gas. We think a lot about it billionaires, but in fact, that's not where the bulk of

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:48.520
[Guest]: the action has been over the past, you know, quarter century. And so that became a sort

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.280
[Guest]: of hallmark, I think, of India's political economy.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.680
[Amit Varma]: Right. And there's a third kind of rent you mentioned political rents. Explain that.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:04.640
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, I think here in political rents, I mean, obviously, there are two ways of looking

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:13.680
[Guest]: at it. So one is, when you're a politician, you are in a position to kind of extract resources

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:22.280
[Guest]: to, you know, further your own career. So the standard example is you're a politician

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:28.760
[Guest]: who has access to inside information about where a highway is going to go. And so therefore

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:34.400
[Guest]: you trade on that interest either directly because you've set up a firm or your family

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:39.480
[Guest]: member set up a firm. And you know, one remarkable fact about India is there's really no conflict

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:45.840
[Guest]: of interest statute at the federal level here. So, you know, even today, members of parliament

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.920
[Guest]: who have business interests, the only people that they have to declare those interests

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:55.520
[Guest]: to are the parliament secretariat and the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha. And those are private.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.360
[Guest]: So the secretariat knows, but the people don't actually know. So it becomes very, very easy

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.640
[Guest]: to do that. And then the second, of course, aspect of political rents is this question

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:11.960
[Guest]: of sort of, you know, campaign finance, right? And being able to accumulate resources in

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:17.440
[Guest]: a way that gives you a leg up. And I think this is where the political parties, you know,

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.720
[Guest]: come in. You know, there is this question of, well, what is it that attracts political

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:28.400
[Guest]: parties to criminals, right? In many societies, if you knew someone was tainted or tarnished

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.400
[Guest]: because of some serious criminal case, you would sort of hightail it in the opposite

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.120
[Guest]: direction. But in India, they actually are falling over one another to try to recruit

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.200
[Guest]: these people to contest on their party labels.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.120
[Amit Varma]: Sadanand And that will bring us to the second question,

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:46.120
[Amit Varma]: which we'll come to after a short break. But before that, for those of my listeners who

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:51.520
[Amit Varma]: want an illustration of the first aspect of political rents that Milan just spoke about,

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.160
[Amit Varma]: consider the Bangalore airport. Why is it so incredibly far from the city? Just look

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.520
[Amit Varma]: into who bought all the land around it before the location was announced. We'll be back

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.520
[Amit Varma]: after a short break.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.480
[Unknown]: Hello, everybody. Welcome to another awesome week on the IBM podcast network. If you're

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:04.680
[Unknown]: is joined by a special guest on this one. And with that, let's continue with your show.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.620
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with the political scientist Milan

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:12.680
[Amit Varma]: Vaishnav on crime in politics. Why is there so much crime in Indian politics? And we take

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.800
[Amit Varma]: it so much for granted that honestly, if there wasn't so much crime in Indian politics would

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.520
[Amit Varma]: be a little surprise, right? So, you know, we've already looked at sort of the first

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.360
[Amit Varma]: question that you raised, or what are the incentives for criminals to come into politics?

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.280
[Amit Varma]: And it's because vertical integration, they want to look after the interests and all these

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.960
[Amit Varma]: rents to be made, regulatory rents, extractive rents, political rents. It's an absolute no

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.280
[Amit Varma]: brainer, you know, power brings money. If you're already a criminal, you want more of

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:42.600
[Amit Varma]: it and as much as you can. And why experience it second hand or third hand, just get the

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:48.240
[Amit Varma]: real thing. But why do parties pick criminals as a candidates?

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:53.320
[Guest]: So I think to understand the answer that question, you have to go back and think about how the

00:35:53.320 --> 00:36:00.800
[Guest]: landscape has changed in recent decades. And one of the most striking changes has been

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.240
[Guest]: the growth in the cost of elections, right? And the cost of elections has grown for numerous

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:11.820
[Guest]: reasons. One is just population growth, right? The second is the competitiveness of elections

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:17.540
[Guest]: has really increased over time. If you just look at the margins of victory in state and

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.920
[Guest]: national elections, you know, they've come down quite significantly over time as the

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:26.960
[Guest]: political landscape has become more, more crowded. Voters also have certain expectations

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.800
[Guest]: in most places, as many of your listeners in India would certainly know on the eve of

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:37.400
[Guest]: elections, parties and candidates fan out across the country and provide all kinds of

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:42.760
[Guest]: goodies. It could be cash or liquor, the two most common as a way of trying to woo voters

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:48.760
[Guest]: to their side. And now we also have a multiplicity of elections, you know, when there are 3 million

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:53.640
[Guest]: elected panchayat officials in the country, right? So there's been an explosion in the

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.920
[Guest]: number of elections. And so all of these things are kind of interacting. Now, here's where

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.840
[Guest]: we come back to rents. You know, parties are facing this fiscal crunch of how do we meet

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:09.080
[Guest]: this this financial challenge, but they don't want to necessarily dedicate themselves to

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:14.240
[Guest]: the hard work of building party organizations, you know, recruiting members who are going

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:19.760
[Guest]: to fund and so on and so forth. And so they've been increasingly thrust into the embrace

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:25.000
[Guest]: of self financing candidates. Now, self financing candidates, as the name suggests, are people

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.280
[Guest]: who can fund their own campaigns, but they can do more than that. They would pay parties

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:36.120
[Guest]: for the privilege of running. They would perhaps fund or endow candidates on the same party

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:40.840
[Guest]: label who don't have their own resources. They might, you know, willingly engage or

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:45.640
[Guest]: certainly at least look the other way if there's other kind of rent seeking going on. And so

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:52.760
[Guest]: this is, you know, the match that's been made between political parties and wealthy candidates.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.320
[Guest]: Now the question is where do criminals come in? Because, you know, an obvious question

00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:01.360
[Guest]: as well. You know, there are a lot of people in India with money, right? I mean, there's

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.840
[Guest]: celebrities, there's film stars, there's cricketeers, there's whatever.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.840
[Amit Varma]: Not podcasters.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:13.040
[Guest]: Not podcasters or political scientists for that matter. And, you know, one thing that

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:19.200
[Guest]: criminals have is A, they have liquid resources. So both the means and the know how of how

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:25.600
[Guest]: to move money. The second is they have a kind of organizational platform because they tend

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:31.280
[Guest]: to be deeply embedded in the constituencies which they've come to represent, right? So

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:39.160
[Guest]: they have those networks of people and personnel and supporters already at hand. And of course

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:44.040
[Guest]: there's some incentive for them in terms of protection to become part of the state. Now

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:50.120
[Guest]: in India there is no formal immunity if you've been charged, cheated with a crime or even

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:54.560
[Guest]: indicted. The question of losing your seat only comes if you're convicted and even then

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:59.200
[Guest]: there are loopholes. But of course everyone knows that once you hold a position of political

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:06.300
[Guest]: power there are various formal and informal ways to derail or delay justice. So it could

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:11.440
[Guest]: be getting an official transferred, you know, sort of threatening punitive action if a member

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:17.600
[Guest]: of the state tries to come at you. So they have both parties and candidates sort of have

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.920
[Amit Varma]: incentives to make this match work.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:26.440
[Amit Varma]: I don't know why my mind suddenly went to a fellow Amit. But leaving that aside, I write

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.640
[Amit Varma]: limericks for the Times of India and one that I rather like that I've written for them a

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:34.520
[Amit Varma]: long time back is called politics and it kind of it's illustrates what you say. A Neta who

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:39.280
[Amit Varma]: loves currency notes told me what his line of work denotes. It is kind of funny. We steal

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.080
[Amit Varma]: people's money and we use some of it to buy their votes. And one of the interesting questions

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.160
[Amit Varma]: I had about this, which a book points out is that everything is secret ballot. So you

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:53.040
[Amit Varma]: could bribe a voter. But I always used to wonder that why is it that he will then, you

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:58.880
[Amit Varma]: know, take a bribe from party X and not just vote for party Y. And what your book sort

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.780
[Amit Varma]: of pointed out is that look, you know, parties know this that, you know, just by paying money

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:08.000
[Amit Varma]: to a voter, they're not necessarily getting the vote, but it becomes a hygiene factor.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.420
[Amit Varma]: They know for sure that if they don't give him money, they're not getting their vote.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:16.160
[Amit Varma]: So they have to pay money anyway as a kind of hygiene factor. And over time, a sort of

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.720
[Amit Varma]: Lake Wobegon effect kicks in and everybody has to pay more and more and campaign finance

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.660
[Amit Varma]: just goes through the roof. And and then what do you do, you know, and these self financing

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:30.360
[Amit Varma]: candidates come in and just take over the whole process. This so this is fundamentally

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:34.320
[Guest]: the one big reason, right? Yeah, I mean, I think, look, we've done ourselves a great

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:39.200
[Guest]: disservice by harping on this term vote buying, because it's not an accurate description of

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.960
[Guest]: what's going on. I would prefer gift giving, because the idea that you could buy votes

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.480
[Guest]: is that there's some ironclad contract that you could sign with the voter saying, look,

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.280
[Guest]: I'm going to give you 500 bucks, and you're going to vote for me. Now, as you said, with

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:56.920
[Guest]: the secret ballot, if I'm a savvy voter, I'm getting 500 bucks from from you and the next

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:01.880
[Guest]: guy and three other people, and then I'll vote my conscience. But what politicians believe

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:09.520
[Guest]: is that if they don't give money, there certainly will lose. So money doesn't buy you victory,

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.800
[Guest]: it buys you a seat at the table. So the analogy that I use, it's it's sort of like playing

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.840
[Guest]: poker, right? If you're playing poker with your friends, and you want to get dealt a

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:21.640
[Guest]: stack of cards, you've got to Annie up, you've got to put something in the pot. Now, just

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:25.080
[Guest]: because you've ended up and you've given some money doesn't mean you'll win, but you have

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.120
[Guest]: no shot at winning if you don't do that, because you won't be at the table, right? And so it's

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:34.560
[Guest]: a it's a kind of a classic prisoner's dilemma, right? Everyone would be better off if you

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:40.280
[Guest]: cooperated and didn't give money. But the risks of defection are so high, that if I

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:45.240
[Guest]: choose not to give and Amit gives, then he's now at a competitive advantage.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.520
[Amit Varma]: So I was actually a professional poker player for five years and a winning player. Did you

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:52.360
[Guest]: know this? I did not know this. Yeah. So let me so why are you doing podcasts now?

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.840
[Amit Varma]: Oh, well, long story, which I've spoken about on another podcast, you've appeared on Cyrus

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:02.000
[Amit Varma]: says, but just to sort of, if you'll allow me to counter what you just said, I think

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.480
[Amit Varma]: gift giving is a bit of a euphemism. I'd say it is what buying and here's why, of course,

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:10.960
[Amit Varma]: they won't get the vote. But let's say they don't give the voter money, the probability

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.240
[Amit Varma]: of getting a vote is zero. If they give the voter money, the probability is non zero,

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:19.800
[Amit Varma]: let's say maybe it's point 2.3, whatever. So they're buying point 2.3 of a vote, that's

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:24.560
[Amit Varma]: the expected value. So I'd still call it what buying except that it's not a full vote. It's

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:29.160
[Guest]: a non zero. Yeah, I think that's that's a fair way of looking at it. Right. But, you

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:34.160
[Guest]: know, there are some places in the world and there's a lot of research from Argentina and

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:40.200
[Guest]: other Latin American countries where local party machines are quite strong. So you're

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:45.560
[Guest]: able to monitor with some degree of measurement error what voters actually do on election

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:51.680
[Guest]: day. And so therefore, you know, that kind of quid pro quo might be easier to consummate.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:56.440
[Amit Varma]: I just think it is lower. I think in India, it's lower. Right. Moving on from there. I

00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.200
[Amit Varma]: mean, it's so far is fairly logical that okay, you know, obviously, criminals want to get

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:04.600
[Amit Varma]: into politics. Power is money. The Indian state has so much power and discretion that

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:09.220
[Amit Varma]: it's just a source of unlimited rents. And political parties, which are the intermediaries

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:15.120
[Amit Varma]: between in the marketplace between candidates and voters to exist, they need money to fight

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:19.040
[Amit Varma]: elections, they need money, self financing candidates are the best. And, you know, if

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:23.480
[Amit Varma]: a candidate finances himself, he is effectively subsidizing others, like you pointed out in

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:28.080
[Amit Varma]: your book, because the opportunity cost of the money and so on. The big question here

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:34.960
[Amit Varma]: is that, you know, we are in a democracy, why do informed voters actually choose to

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.480
[Amit Varma]: vote for criminal politicians? In fact, one of the most surprising statistics in your

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:45.680
[Amit Varma]: book was that if you are a criminal, your chances of winning an election are far higher

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:50.880
[Amit Varma]: than that of a non criminal. It is clearly a feature, not a bug. Why do voters vote for

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:57.720
[Guest]: criminals? Right. So I think just to rewind for one second, if you look at this association

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:06.080
[Guest]: between money and criminality, what you see is that money, rich politicians do seem to

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:11.560
[Guest]: be disproportionately rewarded. But criminal politicians who are rich seem to have an additional

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.920
[Guest]: bump. So if money were doing all the work, then criminality shouldn't matter. So clearly

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:20.160
[Guest]: there's something above and beyond. There's a delta there that's benefiting criminals.

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.440
[Guest]: So what is that? And that's where I think the voters come into play. So, you know, I

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:30.160
[Guest]: think there's kind of two cardinal facts about how Indian politics tend to operate, right?

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:37.120
[Guest]: So one is that in many parts of this country, the rule of law is quite weak. And what I

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:43.840
[Guest]: mean by that is that the government is not seen as an impartial or credible provider

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:50.360
[Guest]: of kind of core state functions, right? So what public goods delivery, law and order,

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:56.880
[Guest]: justice and so on. So that's one. There's a vacuum there. Now, number two is that obviously

00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:03.760
[Guest]: we know that identity politics and social divisions are a prominent feature of Indian

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:08.480
[Guest]: politics and that it varies from place to place. In some places, the divisions or the

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:14.280
[Guest]: contestation between caste groups and communities may be less or may be more. But in those places

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:20.960
[Guest]: where the rule of law is weak and those social divisions are highly salient, criminals are

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:26.600
[Guest]: able to use their criminality essentially as a sign of their credibility to get things

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:32.200
[Guest]: done for their constituents, right? So they're basically able to say, if you support me,

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:39.080
[Guest]: I'll be able to do your work by hook or crook. Now, the pitch they're making is not necessarily

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:45.080
[Guest]: to the constituency at large. It's primarily to their own caste or community and those

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:50.640
[Guest]: allied groups, right? And because we're in a first-past-the-post system, you know, you

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:56.600
[Guest]: can win an election with 25 or 30 percent of the vote. So you don't have to cater to

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:01.580
[Guest]: the median voter, right? If you could get your group and a few others on board, then

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:07.120
[Guest]: you could cross the finish line first. So in some ways, the electoral system also creates,

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:15.200
[Guest]: you know, further incentives. So this kind of reverses the usual logic of information

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:22.320
[Guest]: on its head, right? Which is voters actually know and candidates who are criminals have

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:27.000
[Guest]: an incentive to advertise that they have these characteristics because it's seen as an asset

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.720
[Guest]: and many parts are not a liability.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.360
[Amit Varma]: Just to sort of then unpack those two points. The first point is, of course, there's no

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.720
[Amit Varma]: – the rule of law in large parts of this country is completely absent. It's an illusion.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:41.520
[Amit Varma]: And government, it's said, often begins as a protection racket. And when the government

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.760
[Amit Varma]: doesn't do its job of, you know, being a credible protection racket, you have competing protection

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:51.280
[Amit Varma]: rackets coming in, which may or may not, you know, divide along lines of ethnicity or caste

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:56.720
[Amit Varma]: or identity or whatever. So the first fundamental function that a lot of these criminal groups

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.440
[Amit Varma]: do is that, listen, there is no law and order here. And I am the law and order. And this

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.400
[Amit Varma]: is something again, you point out with a bunch of concrete examples in your book, whether

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:09.200
[Amit Varma]: it's Mohammed Shah, Shahabuddin, or other people, where people often say about them

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.320
[Amit Varma]: that look, okay, you know, he might have all these criminal activities through his name,

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:17.480
[Amit Varma]: but he looks after us. You know, these are all of the things that he does for us. And

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.580
[Amit Varma]: when they list them out, you realize that, you know, this is a gap created by the absence

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:25.520
[Amit Varma]: of the state, the state can't provide all of this, whether it's little things like conflict

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:29.720
[Amit Varma]: resolution, or whether it's basic communities, these are guys coming and saying, Okay, I'll

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:34.880
[Amit Varma]: take care of all of you. So it's not just a gunda becoming the dada, but taking the

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:39.440
[Amit Varma]: place of the state in a sense, and therefore getting that respect from the community that

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.040
[Amit Varma]: this is a guy who does everything and therefore they can win the election and make the additional

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.040
[Guest]: rents that there are.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.520
[Guest]: Yeah, and I think there's a variety of ways that they can do this. So I talked about that

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:52.040
[Guest]: in the book. So you know, the one thing is sort of intervening in the administration

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:58.680
[Guest]: and distribution of welfare benefits, right? You are denied a BPL card, the BDO, block

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:03.480
[Guest]: development officer in your locality is not paying attention. I contact my politician,

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.400
[Guest]: he threatens to, you know, knock a couple heads together and all of a sudden I get my

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:12.080
[Guest]: BPL card. So there's something around kind of welfare and administration. Law and order

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:18.040
[Guest]: security is another one, right? I mean, in many places, you go to a police house and

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.120
[Guest]: you are saying, Look, I've been a victim of a crime and they just you know, if you're

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:27.040
[Guest]: not the right profile, then you won't get an FIR filed. But again, that's worth someone

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:32.240
[Guest]: who can throw their weight around to make that work done, get that work done as a benefit.

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:38.800
[Guest]: Similar stories with justice, right? We know that the judiciary in India has so many weaknesses,

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:45.320
[Guest]: especially at the local level. And so therefore, if you have a neighborly dispute with someone

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:50.120
[Guest]: who's in your area, you could go to the courts, but you may be waiting decades for a verdict.

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:55.480
[Guest]: So if you go to a strongman who's able to enforce a decision, even if he rules against

00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:01.160
[Guest]: you, at least he's decided, right? And there's sort of some finality. The fourth thing is,

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:06.480
[Guest]: I think, is a kind of social insurance function. You know, I mean, especially for households

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:11.880
[Guest]: who are hovering around the poverty line, any one shock, it could be a death in the

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:16.400
[Guest]: family, it could be an illness, it could be a marriage, right, where you have to come

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:22.560
[Guest]: up with dowry payments, you need someone that you can turn to in your kind of hour of need.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.800
[Guest]: And that's another thing that these criminal candidates are quite good at. So one of the

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:30.040
[Guest]: things you often hear when you interview their voters is, you know, you paid for my daughter's

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:36.560
[Guest]: wedding, right? Or I had to take care of expenses after my mother died. And I didn't know who

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.520
[Guest]: to turn to because I didn't have access to formal credit.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:44.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And one of the, you know, in your book, there's a stroke of this politician who claims

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:49.520
[Amit Varma]: he funded, you know, 10,000 marriages, I think, in a particular area himself. And there's

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.040
[Amit Varma]: an interesting defense of the same guy, if I remember by someone speaking to you and

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.440
[Amit Varma]: saying, Listen, he didn't actually murder anyone, he just ordered them.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:03.440
[Guest]: Yeah. So I this was a politician by the name of Anand Singh, who was a curious figure,

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:10.600
[Guest]: because at the time I went and saw him, this was 2010 in Bihar. And this was when Nitish

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:15.880
[Guest]: Kumar had this sort of governance revolution, you know, after the what they call the 15

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:21.160
[Guest]: years of jungle Raj, you know, under Lallu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi. And here was

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:29.440
[Guest]: this good governance, Chief Minister, who was, you know, patronizing this gunda politician

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:34.280
[Guest]: Anand Singh, partially because he represented a very important sort of caste community,

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:40.640
[Guest]: the Bhoomi hars in central Bihar. And so I'd gone to see sort of a, you know, kind of educated

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:45.520
[Guest]: engineer who was a friend of a friend who lived in Anand Singh's constituency. And I

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:48.680
[Guest]: was pressing him on, you know, why would you vote for someone like this? And, you know,

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:53.440
[Guest]: I read today in the Times of India that he's wanted on sexual assault charters and murder

00:50:53.440 --> 00:51:00.040
[Guest]: cases and you know, all these really pretty nefarious things. And, and, and then he had

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:07.320
[Guest]: this insight, which is, you know, you misunderstand, you know, Anand Singh isn't a murderer, he

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:12.360
[Guest]: merely manages murder. And that's where the protection racket really hit me, right? I

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:18.600
[Guest]: mean, what he was saying is, Anand Singh is the CEO of my local protection racket, and

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:24.840
[Guest]: I'm one of the people who's being protected. So if I want the guys over there, you know,

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.840
[Guest]: sort of figuratively pointing towards the, you know, backward caste community, the other

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:33.920
[Guest]: community which is gaining ground, if I want them to take over my land and my house, then

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:40.760
[Guest]: I can vote for a Mr. Clean politician. But as, as you know, until law and order gets

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.400
[Guest]: sorted, you know, I'm going to need my, my protection, and he's the one who's doing it.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:49.520
[Guest]: So you're calling him coming from the big city and calling him a criminal, but I see

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.520
[Guest]: him as necessary.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.560
[Amit Varma]: Sadanand Rajanamurti And it's because of one protection racket

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:58.640
[Amit Varma]: that we should be there, the legitimate protection racket of the state is absent, which is why

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:02.120
[Amit Varma]: you have these sort of competing protection rackets and it's competing protection rackets,

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:08.040
[Amit Varma]: because you're often, mostly in India, along ethnic lines or caste lines, or basically

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:13.120
[Amit Varma]: along identity politics line, which with each sort of racket saying, hey, I look after my

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:18.000
[Amit Varma]: people and it's like you quote Lalu Prasad in your book, where at one point he says,

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.560
[Amit Varma]: vikas nahi samman chahiye, which was his, this thing, which is basically, we don't want

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:27.600
[Amit Varma]: development, we want respect. And again, he's speaking for a bunch of, you know, castes,

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:32.040
[Amit Varma]: which otherwise feel ignored. And that's what matters to them. Not so much development,

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:36.040
[Amit Varma]: because hey, who believes in words like that, but just patronage, give patronage to our

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.040
[Guest]: people.

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.040
[Guest]: You know,

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:46.600
[Guest]: I don't want to glorify these criminal politicians, because there's a central flaw in the story,

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:53.840
[Guest]: which is, at the end of the day, these characters, yes, they may be providing something of value.

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:58.960
[Guest]: And I think the fact that they're doing that, and or the perception that they're doing that

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:07.600
[Guest]: is what gives them voter backing. But they don't have incentive to fundamentally fix

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:14.440
[Guest]: what ails the state, because they are able to mobilize on the fact that the state doesn't

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:20.120
[Guest]: work. And so you need me to help navigate it, right? You need me to get the charges

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:25.360
[Guest]: filed at the police house, you need me to get the BPL card. Once you actually improve

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:31.440
[Guest]: the state sufficiently, that intermediary's role disappears. And so they're interested

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:36.920
[Guest]: typically in bandaid fixes, right? I'm not going to push for a whole scale reform of

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:43.120
[Guest]: the police apparatus. I don't want to necessarily fix the welfare distribution system. I want

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:48.600
[Guest]: to have an incentive to keep it broken, but then apply patches or band-aids where I see

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:53.960
[Guest]: fit. So I think that's the one central flaw, which shouldn't be overlooked. And the second,

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:59.760
[Guest]: again, just to reiterate, they're not necessarily interested in doing this for their constituency

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:05.960
[Guest]: at large, right? I mean, they are very explicit that they function sort of like Robin Hoods,

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:10.360
[Guest]: where you're not necessarily taking resources from the rich to pay the poor. You're taking

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:15.000
[Guest]: resources from one community and redistributing it to another community. So I think those

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:21.640
[Guest]: are there are all kinds of negative externalities from this kind of a transaction.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.160
[Amit Varma]: Sadaq Khan Which brings us to your fourth question. Like

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:29.040
[Amit Varma]: we've looked at the three kinds of incentives so far incentives for the criminals to get

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:33.800
[Amit Varma]: into politics, for the parties to pick criminals and for the voters to vote. And you know,

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.560
[Amit Varma]: because there's no rule of law, because everyone is divided along identity lines, it makes

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:42.160
[Amit Varma]: sense for them to vote for the local dada who look after their needs because there's

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:48.040
[Amit Varma]: no other protection racket in town. How do we fix this? An even more fundamental philosophical

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:52.440
[Amit Varma]: question that you asked before you bear you know, when you begin your chapter, much to

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:57.320
[Amit Varma]: my gratification, because the question struck me as well, which is that if we are placing

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:02.840
[Amit Varma]: a value on a democracy where people choose their leaders, the leaders they want, why

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.840
[Amit Varma]: should we fix this?

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.120
[Guest]: Dr. Ian Lamb Yeah, I mean, that sort of, I think, builds

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:13.480
[Guest]: on what I just said before, which is, the election of criminals does solve a particular

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:18.440
[Guest]: problem in terms of it allows people to have access to something that they may not have

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:23.080
[Guest]: had before, right? Or, in some cases, even it's the promise of that access, they don't

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:27.480
[Guest]: know that they'll need something now, but they may need it in the future. And so therefore,

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:32.880
[Guest]: it's a kind of hedge against risk. But as I mentioned, there are these larger negative

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:38.720
[Guest]: externalities, because the system will never sort of improve. So what do we do to fix it?

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:44.080
[Guest]: You know, there, if you take the same kind of supply and demand function, or analogy

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:50.760
[Guest]: that I discussed, so on the supply side, this really has to do with with money, right? How

00:55:50.760 --> 00:56:00.120
[Guest]: do you try to create a system such that money from private individuals plays less of a role?

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:05.040
[Guest]: And so that gets fundamentally to campaign finance reform. Then when you get to the demand

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:12.560
[Guest]: side, one of in the ways the most disheartening messages of the book is, I wish that this

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:18.200
[Guest]: was just an information story. Because if this was just an information story of voters

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:23.320
[Guest]: don't know how to tell a good type from a bad type, then you could invest in media,

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:29.840
[Guest]: you could invest in civic activism, you could invest in voter education. But if these individuals

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:35.000
[Guest]: are actually doing something which is both informed and rational, then you then you have

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:42.160
[Guest]: a problem. And the only solution there is trying to find ways of building up the state

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:48.040
[Guest]: capacity. And I think here, they're kind of two aspects, right? I think we often get into

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:52.840
[Guest]: these very simplistic debates, not just in India, the United States and the EU everywhere

00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:57.400
[Guest]: about, you know, do we shrink the state? Do we grow the state? And you sort of have to

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:03.400
[Guest]: do both at the same time. So the problem in India is that you have a bureaucracy that's

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.960
[Guest]: over bureaucratized in procedural terms, right? So this is whether it's the ease of doing

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:12.380
[Guest]: business or the ease of, you know, getting welfare benefits, everybody who's ever tried

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:18.320
[Guest]: to interact with the Indian state knows that it's extremely difficult, costly, inefficient,

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:23.440
[Guest]: and so on. So you have to kind of cut that fat. But at the same time, the Indian state

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:28.200
[Guest]: has to build up its muscle. And what I mean by that is, even though it's over bureaucratized

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:33.520
[Guest]: procedurally, it's highly undermanned in personnel terms, right? There are large parts of the

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:38.520
[Guest]: bureaucratic apparatus, which simply not only don't have enough people, but they also don't

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:43.040
[Guest]: have the right kinds of people or the people with the right skills. And so, you know, it's

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:47.840
[Guest]: sort of a cute phrase. But the thing I say in the book is you kind of have to right size

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:52.760
[Guest]: the state, right? Now, the trouble over there is this is a generational challenge, right?

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:58.000
[Guest]: I mean, this is something that politicians will have to do, and then exceeds their limited

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.400
[Guest]: time horizon of say, four or five years.

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.240
[Amit Varma]: Sadanandam Bhaiyaan, Ph.D.: Yeah, and that's, in fact, an insight I first picked up from

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Fukuyama that what India needs is a strong state that does a few things well, instead

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:12.800
[Amit Varma]: of what we have now, which is a very large state that does everything badly. And, you

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:16.880
[Amit Varma]: know, again, like you point out in the book, our problem is not people, we perhaps need

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.920
[Amit Varma]: more people, our problem is procedures, there are too many procedures. And both of those

00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:27.200
[Amit Varma]: seem to strike at the heart of the incentives problem here. If you just have much less procedures,

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:32.640
[Amit Varma]: much less licenses to give to people, much less discretion that government servants have,

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:37.440
[Amit Varma]: then you immediately reduce rents available and therefore the incentives for criminals

00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:42.200
[Amit Varma]: to come into politics because hey, how do you profit? And at the same time, if you actually

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:46.160
[Amit Varma]: strengthen your state where you need to, if you have a good rule of law, if you have good

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:52.000
[Amit Varma]: police, if you have good conflict resolution and, you know, good, you fix the justice system,

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.240
[Amit Varma]: then you don't need a protection racket apart from that because the state is doing its job

00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:01.720
[Amit Varma]: and then you change the incentives for the voters to act. But, you know, I mean, these

00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:06.640
[Amit Varma]: two are the obvious but very long-term fixes. And the problem with long-term fixes is that

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:11.400
[Amit Varma]: politicians live for the short term. So what are their incentives? I mean, can changes

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.840
[Amit Varma]: like this ever happen? They haven't for 71 years.

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:18.240
[Guest]: Yeah. No, it's a good question. I mean, I think there's some good news and some bad

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:27.000
[Guest]: news, right? So on the good news, you could say that, you know, as India is getting richer,

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:33.520
[Guest]: as per capita incomes are rising, politicians in many states have stopped tinkering with

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:39.640
[Guest]: the sort of petty corruption that most citizens have to interact with, right? So in some ways,

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:44.040
[Guest]: this is the story of the southern states, right? In Tamil Nadu, the day-to-day state

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:48.760
[Guest]: when it comes to kind of welfare and other things works pretty well, but because politicians

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:53.800
[Guest]: are focused on larger rents, right? Larger rents about roads and ports and highways and

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:59.200
[Guest]: extraction and so on. Now, one could say cynically, that's a sign of progress, right? You've kind

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:03.080
[Guest]: of shifted from a blue collar corruption equilibrium to a white collar.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.920
[Guest]: At least the common man doesn't face a burden.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:11.600
[Guest]: At least the common man doesn't face a burden and, you know, just look at Andhra and Tamil

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:17.360
[Guest]: Nadu in particular. I mean, it's virtually impossible to make it in politics if you aren't

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.600
[Guest]: some kind of person involved in infrastructure or real estate, right? I mean, that's where

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:29.280
[Guest]: the – it's most noticeable. So the flippant sort of thing I talk about, I guess it's

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.480
[Guest]: not in the book, but what I was thinking about, which is a kind of film analogy is, you know,

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:38.640
[Guest]: sort of like the transition from Godfather I to Godfather III, right? I mean, how do

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.840
[Guest]: you essentially legitimize yourself that you move away from kind of ordinary corruption

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:49.880
[Guest]: to try to actually, you know, make money in a maybe perhaps less corrupt or less distortionary

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:54.640
[Guest]: way for kind of the average person? And I think that's the sort of trajectory that

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.440
[Guest]: maybe India is on. So that's one.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.080
[Guest]: The second is, you know, the middle class is very absent. And I think one of the big

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:06.200
[Guest]: stories about post-independence India is how the middle class has really exited from mainstream

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.200
[Guest]: politics. You know, I think many people who were in the middle class were disappointed

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.360
[Guest]: with what the state could do and then realized that they had private alternatives, whether

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:23.200
[Guest]: it's schools, water, education, healthcare, security. And so how do we re-engage that

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.680
[Guest]: part of the citizenry to say, look, this matters for you? Because at some point, you have to

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:33.280
[Guest]: step outside of your bubble and deal with, you know, the central problem of the state.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:37.720
[Guest]: And that's, you know, historically, I think, in many societies, what has helped to kind

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:45.040
[Guest]: of push reform. And then crisis, right? I mean, when you see or have either economic

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:50.440
[Guest]: crises or corruption scandals, right, they tend to introduce some kind of turn in the

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.560
[Guest]: system. Now, unfortunately, you don't want to wait for a crisis to happen to have to

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.840
[Guest]: do reform. But I think empirically, that's often what we see.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.520
[Amit Varma]: Some would argue we are in the middle of an ongoing crisis. It's like a frog in boiling

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.200
[Amit Varma]: water. You don't notice the temperature getting higher. Of course, that's an apocryphal story.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:12.440
[Amit Varma]: The frog will actually jump out if the water reaches a certain temperature. And the interesting

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.760
[Amit Varma]: thing about the second point you made is that India's middle class has actually grown massively

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:20.360
[Amit Varma]: since liberalization. So you'd expect that, you know, earlier, one reason for the apathy

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:24.080
[Amit Varma]: could have been that, you know, what difference does it make if I go and vote? It makes absolutely

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.520
[Amit Varma]: no difference. But now that's changed. But then, you know, people respond to crisis in

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:33.120
[Amit Varma]: different ways. And it's not necessary that everyone will want these long term kind of

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:36.360
[Amit Varma]: solutions. What you also say in your book is that a lot of the short term solutions

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.720
[Amit Varma]: which people come up with just don't work and might even be dangerous. Tell me a little

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.720
[Guest]: bit about that.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:49.680
[Guest]: Well, you know, I think if you take the justice system, for example, everybody's favorite

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.880
[Guest]: remedy for what ails the justice system is fast track courts, right? And so we saw this

01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:01.920
[Guest]: after the horrific gang rape in Delhi in 2012. We this even got gets talked about in the

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.200
[Guest]: context of criminal politicians that can't you just set up fast track courts and I talk

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:11.740
[Guest]: about that in the book as well. But what you see from studies of these courts is that eventually

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:17.640
[Guest]: they just succumb to the larger pathologies of the justice system. That's one problem.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.360
[Guest]: The second problem is by giving fast justice to someone, you're necessarily giving slow

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:28.680
[Guest]: justice to someone else. You know, I think this is a really hard nut to crack because

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:34.160
[Guest]: politicians are able to occupy this gray space where they're able to say, look, I've been

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:40.560
[Guest]: charged with a crime, but I haven't been convicted of one yet. And in this country, we have the

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:45.840
[Guest]: rule of law which says, look, there's a presumption of innocence until being proven guilty. And

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:51.520
[Guest]: they're right. Now, on the other hand, given the infirmities of the justice system, they

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:57.200
[Guest]: also know that they can wait this out. So, you know, if we go back to the case of Anand

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:03.120
[Guest]: Singh, who was the CEO of the protection racket, the the management of murder, not the murder,

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:09.920
[Guest]: you know, he had dozens of cases that went back literally decades, and none of them had

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:16.840
[Guest]: ever come to any kind of conclusion because, you know, judges passed on, prosecutors were

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:22.320
[Guest]: transferred evidence, you know, literally went up missing, witnesses got got cold feet.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:28.520
[Guest]: And so the solution to the problem is kind of inherent in the nature of the problem itself.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:35.880
[Amit Varma]: Right. Your fifth question, finally, which is what is the impact of this on democracy?

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:41.240
[Guest]: So you know, here, I think there's a couple of ways of looking at it. I mean, I think

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:49.920
[Guest]: one is that, in some ways, you know, criminality is a byproduct of how democracy has been functioning

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.960
[Guest]: in a weakly institutionalized setting. You know, I think there's some people who would

01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:02.040
[Guest]: prefer to consider this phenomenon, as you know, these are a bunch of sub national, authoritarian

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:08.280
[Guest]: figures who are going around coercing voters and manipulating results. And that's how they're

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:13.680
[Guest]: able to win. I don't find that framing to be very helpful, because, you know, in many

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:20.000
[Guest]: cases, these are people who are will winning some of the most competitive elections anywhere

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:26.560
[Guest]: in the world. And they're doing that. Because voters vote for them, and again, believe that

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:30.600
[Guest]: they're making a rational calculation, it may not be the first best solution, right?

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:35.360
[Guest]: I mean, voters are not stupid, they Yeah, it'd be great to have a clean politician.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:40.160
[Guest]: But given what's around us, I don't think that that's necessarily going to pay off for

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:48.800
[Guest]: the here and the now. So I think the larger potential fallout from this is, does it start

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:56.760
[Guest]: to erode people's perceptions of democracy and the rule of law? Do they start to say,

01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:02.680
[Guest]: well, this particular politician is able to get away literally with murder? And so therefore,

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:08.960
[Guest]: you know, why should a different set of rules, you know, apply to me? And, you know, I think

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:14.200
[Guest]: here to, you know, this is where money comes in, right? If people literally think that,

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.680
[Guest]: you know, look, I mean, you could buy or sell elections, then forget about it, I'm just

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.880
[Guest]: going to retreat, and you end up with voter apathy, or you just get up with this very

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:29.800
[Guest]: cynical kind of notion of special interest politics. So, so again, it's a good news,

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:34.160
[Guest]: bad news story, which in some sense, these people are products of democracy, but they're

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:40.600
[Guest]: creating a kind of partial accountability that has lots of other, you know, negative

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.600
[Guest]: consequences.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:45.240
[Amit Varma]: Sadaq Khan So I'm going to kind of end with a standard

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:51.200
[Amit Varma]: question, which I ask all of my guests on the subject of the choice, which is not about

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:56.200
[Amit Varma]: crime in politics, but about democracy in general, Indian democracy in general, what

01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:00.920
[Amit Varma]: makes you hopeful? And what makes you despair about the future of Indian democracy, let's

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.920
[Amit Varma]: say within a 10 year timeframe from now?

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:08.720
[Guest]: Dr. Ian Lamb So I think what makes me hopeful is that,

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:14.320
[Guest]: you know, is sort of the legacy of the past in some sense, and that, you know, every 10

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:20.000
[Guest]: years or so, someone writes a big book, which pronounces, you know, that Indian democracy

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.240
[Guest]: is going to implode. And every 10 years, those people have been proven wrong. I mean, it

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:30.320
[Guest]: goes back to, you know, Selig Harrison, and the most dangerous decades, which, you know,

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:34.720
[Guest]: was written, I believe, in the 1950s, or 1960s, saying, you know, this place isn't going to

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:41.880
[Guest]: last very long. So, you know, Sunil Killnani has this very nice insight in the idea of

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:47.760
[Guest]: India where he says, it wasn't that there was some grand normative consensus around

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:54.480
[Guest]: liberal democracy in India, it was basically the only system that could potentially handle

01:07:54.480 --> 01:08:01.760
[Guest]: this constant collision of different interests, and ideas and customs, right, that they were

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:07.440
[Guest]: constantly clashing, and this was a way to sort of accommodate them. So I think on that

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:14.680
[Guest]: overall story, I think, sort of still holds, I think one of the emerging issues that we're

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:22.400
[Guest]: not paying attention to is what is happening in our states across our states, right? There

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:29.800
[Guest]: is an increasingly entrenched interstate inequality. And it's not just North and South. Well, that's

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:36.560
[Guest]: one dimension, but it's also kind of an East West story. You've seen the recent stir over

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.760
[Guest]: the Finance Commission and whether or not central transfer should be allocated on the

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:45.480
[Guest]: basis of population or something else. Obviously, if it was population, you know, the South

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:51.080
[Guest]: would lose because fertility rates have dropped. There's a question over how you share tax

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:56.240
[Guest]: revenue, you know, there's a study which shows that on income, you know, the three richest

01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:01.440
[Guest]: states are three times richer than the three poorest states, then there's something that

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:05.640
[Guest]: I wrote about recently, which is political representation, you know, India's legislatures

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:11.920
[Guest]: are highly malapportioned, right? We have not updated the statewise breakdown of parliamentary

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:17.880
[Guest]: seats since 1971. And if you were to do that today, you know, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar would

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:23.520
[Guest]: get 16 seats and, you know, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu would lose about, you know, 15

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:29.400
[Guest]: seats. That's a huge shift in political power. And it's only going to get worse. The Constitution

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:34.360
[Guest]: says you can't change this until 2031 when we do that census, at which time those differences

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:39.600
[Guest]: are only going to become more pronounced. So I think we're at a stage where we need

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:45.800
[Guest]: to think of a grand bargain, because Indian federalism was the glue that's kept this project

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:51.080
[Guest]: together. But I think it's now showing showing its age. So you know, in the 50s, we had the

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:55.080
[Guest]: state's reorganization commission, right? That was this moment at which we figured out

01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:00.080
[Guest]: how do we create this kind of federal compact. And I think we're in the need for that moment.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.920
[Guest]: We can't look at each of these issues in isolation. But I fear that's where we're headed.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.120
[Amit Varma]: Mahesh Thakur Thanks. What your answer has done is, is

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.280
[Amit Varma]: filled me with despair about the state of our nation. But I am hopeful that it'll be

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.840
[Amit Varma]: a hell of a spectacle going down. Thank you for coming on the scene in the Unseen.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:12.680
[Unknown]: do you know how to citizen? Hey Shreyas, let's just do a podcast about it. Let's do a podcast

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:19.120
[Unknown]: about it. A podcast is called How to Citizen. In every episode, we get a new guest and discuss

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:26.320
[Unknown]: one chapter from the eighth grade civics textbook. Think about it as three friends revising before

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:32.800
[Unknown]: a test and we go back to school. There's nostalgia, there's trauma, there are lunch breaks, there

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:38.280
[Unknown]: are favorite teachers, there are horrible teachers, there's everything. So every Tuesday, we bring

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:43.080
[Unknown]: in a guest on the podcast and we ask them a very simple question. Do you know how to

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:47.600
[Unknown]: citizen? Meghnad, I think the question is do you know how to citizen? But Shreyas, I'm

01:12:47.600 --> 01:13:09.920
[Unknown]: asking you this question. Do you know how to citizen?
