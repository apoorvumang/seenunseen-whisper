00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
[Amit Varma]: I had a bad dream the other day.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.520
[Amit Varma]: I dreamed that I was unfit and extremely overweight.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.780
[Amit Varma]: Now this doesn't sound like a dream because I am actually unfit and overweight.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.700
[Amit Varma]: But in this dream, I actually went to the government for help.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.700
[Amit Varma]: I went to the Ministry of Health, found a babu there, and said to him, help me, I am

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.940
[Amit Varma]: unfit, I am overweight, my clothes don't fit me, I pant with exhaustion every time I have

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.660
[Amit Varma]: to speak a long sentence like this one, pant, pant, help me, make me fit again, oh Ministry

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.520
[Amit Varma]: of Health.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.500
[Amit Varma]: The babu replied, don't worry, we have plans to make you fit.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.280
[Amit Varma]: We are setting up an SCZ for people like you.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.400
[Amit Varma]: An SCZ, I said, what's an SCZ?

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.440
[Amit Varma]: He replied, an SCZ is a special exercise zone.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.760
[Amit Varma]: We are setting up zones where people only exercise and do nothing else.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.580
[Amit Varma]: Here, the nearest SCZ to you is a hundred kilometers from here, in a remote location

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.720
[Amit Varma]: where there is nothing else.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.760
[Amit Varma]: Find it and get a workout.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:27.000
[Amit Varma]: I want to see that bunch of yours disappear, just like your hard-earned money does, thanks

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.760
[Amit Varma]: to our taxation policies.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.640
[Amit Varma]: Do you understand?

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.720
[Amit Varma]: Do you understand?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.000
[Amit Varma]: I told him I understood.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.360
[Amit Varma]: I found this SCZ, the special exercise zone in the boondocks, and I went there for a week.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.760
[Amit Varma]: Then I took an annual membership and never went again.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:54.720
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.720
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.680
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.280
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.680
[Amit Varma]: In today's episode, I'm going to be talking about SCZs or Special Economic Zones.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.160
[Amit Varma]: SCZs are special areas set up by governments to attract investment by way of offering business-friendly

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.660
[Amit Varma]: regulations.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.120
[Amit Varma]: This begs the question, why not have business-friendly regulation everywhere, if it's such a good

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.120
[Amit Varma]: thing?

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.120
[Amit Varma]: As it certainly is.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.080
[Amit Varma]: SCZs have not just this conceptual flaw, but are also deeply flawed in the ways in which

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.000
[Amit Varma]: they are implemented in India.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.680
[Amit Varma]: I chatted about this a few days ago with my friend Kartik Shashidhar, who has a chapter

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.880
[Amit Varma]: on this in his excellent book, Between the Buyer and the Seller.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.280
[Amit Varma]: Between the Buyer and the Seller is out now on Amazon and I highly recommend it.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.240
[Amit Varma]: For now, let's talk about SCZs.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.920
[Amit Varma]: Kartik, welcome to the show.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.920
[Guest]: Hi Amit.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920
[Amit Varma]: Glad to be back here.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.200
[Amit Varma]: So Kartik, in your book, the very first chapter is a fascinating chapter, which juxtaposes

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.720
[Amit Varma]: two company shutdowns, which kind of happened at the same time, which is towards the end

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.120
[Amit Varma]: of 2014, a Nokia plant shut down in Sriparambudur and it was placed in an SCZ there, a Special

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.360
[Amit Varma]: Economic Zone.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.800
[Amit Varma]: At the same time, Yahoo shut down its India operations and laid off tons of people in

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.080
[Amit Varma]: Bangalore.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.800
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing you point out in the book is that while most of the people

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.920
[Amit Varma]: laid off by Yahoo managed to find other jobs and employment and weren't affected so badly,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.760
[Amit Varma]: the people who were laid off by Nokia and Sriparambudur, on the other hand, could not

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.360
[Amit Varma]: find equivalent jobs and many of them either had to settle for much lower paying jobs or

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.960
[Amit Varma]: they had to migrate to towns.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.480
[Amit Varma]: So why the difference in outcomes?

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.240
[Guest]: Yeah, so there was a great story in Mint, by the way, a few days after this happened,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.600
[Guest]: which spoke about what happened to the guys who were working for Nokia in the Sriparambudur

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.600
[Guest]: plant.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.160
[Guest]: I mean, like as an addition reading, it would be great to just look at what happens if you

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.120
[Guest]: are working in a plant in a remote area where there are no other comparable employment opportunities

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.280
[Guest]: and what happens if the plant needs to shut down.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.800
[Guest]: So it's a great read, I can put the link as part of the podcast.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.200
[Guest]: So I think the big difference was in the terms of the location.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.720
[Guest]: So at the time when the Nokia plant shut down, there were two places in India where mobile

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.360
[Guest]: phones were being manufactured.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.360
[Guest]: There was this particular Yahoo plant in Sriparambudur, which is in an SEC.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.880
[Guest]: And at the same time, Micromax was setting up a manufacturing facility in Rudraprayag

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.080
[Guest]: in Uttaranchal, where again, they had received, I think, some favorable tax treatment and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.080
[Amit Varma]: so on.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.080
[Amit Varma]: So it was like an SEC here.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.200
[Guest]: It was like an SEC, more or less.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.640
[Guest]: And so you had two plants at two opposite ends of the country making a similar thing.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.400
[Guest]: And making mobile phones, I mean, yeah, while it's manufacturing and all that, it's a fairly

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.400
[Guest]: specialized operation.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.640
[Guest]: So like, I mean, and both of these are like, out of the way, I mean, Sriparambudur is still

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.640
[Guest]: not Chennai.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.040
[Guest]: So it's still a bit of an out of the way place.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.000
[Guest]: So it's a bit of a hard to recruit employees when you set up in such places.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.160
[Guest]: I mean, like, I mean, you might get great tax breaks, and the monetary value of the

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.480
[Guest]: tax breaks might typically be more than what you would, the premium you would have to pay

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.840
[Guest]: to get employees in these places.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.160
[Guest]: And but what happens is that it creates enormous risk for the employees.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.680
[Guest]: Because if, in case you shut down, and I mean, like, birth and death of businesses is a part

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.920
[Guest]: of everyday life now.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.760
[Guest]: So it's like, it always has been, in case you shut down, you want your employees to

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.960
[Guest]: have alternate employment opportunities.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.200
[Guest]: And if you are an employee looking for a job, you want to kind of hedge against your company

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.200
[Guest]: going down, and you want to make sure your life doesn't get affected too much, and so

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.200
[Guest]: on.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.320
[Guest]: So if you're in an SEV, where you're working for a company with no similar other companies

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.540
[Guest]: there, it's a very fragile environment to work in.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:01.680
[Guest]: So what, on the other hand, Yahoo, Yahoo also I think was in, some of the offices were in,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.360
[Guest]: in what can be classified as SEVs, they were export promotion parks in Bangalore.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.640
[Guest]: But the important thing is that they were all in Bangalore, which is a large city, which

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.400
[Guest]: is the hub of the IT industry in Bangalore.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.200
[Guest]: So what you saw after Yahoo decided to close its operations in India, was that you actually

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.400
[Guest]: had companies setting up dedicated portals to hire these ex-Yahoo engineers, because

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.720
[Guest]: they knew that Yahoo employed a lot of fairly good people.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.920
[Guest]: And there were now a large number of good people out in the market.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:37.400
[Guest]: So and this was a time when generally, growth was good, the startup industry was booming.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.880
[Guest]: So people wanted to recruit good engineers.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:46.760
[Guest]: So and so and most of them managed to get jobs fairly quickly enough, and without really

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.320
[Guest]: disrupting their lives, because Bangalore has a very liquid job market for IT professionals.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.600
[Amit Varma]: So let me move to a more fundamental question now, you know, which is cities really.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.520
[Amit Varma]: And cities are often demonized and people talk about the low quality of life in cities,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.880
[Amit Varma]: the urban squalor, the congestion, and so on and so forth.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.240
[Amit Varma]: But yet, the history of humanity is really a history of migration from rural areas to

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.560
[Amit Varma]: cities from less crowded areas to more crowded areas.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.680
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, by the year 2045, 70% of the world will live in cities, it's just a continuing

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.680
[Amit Varma]: process.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.600
[Amit Varma]: So people don't have to go to cities, very few people move the other way, unless they're

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.720
[Amit Varma]: very rich, and they buy a farmhouse and so on.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.360
[Amit Varma]: But that's the life of the extremely privileged.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.840
[Amit Varma]: So what accounts for this movement to cities?

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.840
[Amit Varma]: What is the attraction?

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.600
[Guest]: So the attraction of cities is that like, I mean, it's many fold.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.480
[Guest]: But basically, it is that because you are living so close to so many more people in

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.240
[Guest]: a city, there's so much more you can do, there's so much more choice in terms of what you can

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.880
[Guest]: do, there's so many more professions you can pursue in a city compared to what you can

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.320
[Guest]: pursue in a small rural area.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:58.520
[Guest]: So I think what, and also like, if you kind of choose the right city based on your skill

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.280
[Guest]: sets, what will also happen is that you will have a wide range of choice of employment

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.720
[Guest]: in terms of where to work, who to work for, who to work with, and so on.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.040
[Guest]: So that kind of is a huge plus for cities compared to like, smaller areas, because your

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:18.520
[Guest]: life is not fragile to the fortunes of one employer anymore, because there's plenty of

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.560
[Amit Varma]: options for what you want to do.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.560
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.640
[Amit Varma]: So effectively, it's network effects, like companies like to go to cities and businesses

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.200
[Amit Varma]: like to go to cities, because there are many more people they can employ there.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.480
[Amit Varma]: And also individuals like to go to cities, because there are many more opportunities,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:38.280
[Amit Varma]: not just job opportunities, but much bigger, social and economic networks.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.760
[Amit Varma]: And as all trade is a positive something, you benefit the most by being in a place where

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.360
[Amit Varma]: you have more options and more people to essentially trade with.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.360
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.520
[Guest]: So it's basically simple network effects, because in a city, because the market is so

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:57.000
[Guest]: large for anything that you want to do, like there are so many more services that get traded

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.200
[Guest]: in cities compared to rural areas.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.280
[Guest]: So in another chapter in the book, I talk about the restaurant industry and talk about

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.040
[Guest]: how like cities can afford to have restaurants because there are so many people and like,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:13.400
[Guest]: so each restaurant can assume a particular market every day.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.800
[Guest]: But if you're in a rural area, where there's a small number of people living there, and

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.280
[Guest]: nobody wants to eat in the same place every day, unless that place is home, the option

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.880
[Guest]: to have a restaurant market is so much smaller.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.720
[Guest]: So in that sense, it's like for any kind of market, be it employment, be it for things

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.760
[Guest]: you want to enjoy or something, I mean, like best done in cities where there's a tremendous

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.560
[Guest]: scale and there's far more stuff that is traded.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.560
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that's why if you go to an Indian village, you'll never find an Italian restaurant

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.960
[Amit Varma]: or a sushi bar there, because there simply aren't enough customers.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.560
[Amit Varma]: But while those are very niche tastes, in a city, you can cater to those niches profitably

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.040
[Amit Varma]: because you have that kind of scale.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.480
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, first of all, if you go to an Indian village, finding a restaurant itself

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.160
[Guest]: is like, I mean, larger kind of village, it's hard, I mean, it doesn't make economic sense

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.240
[Guest]: to run a restaurant in a village unless you're on a highway or something.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:08.400
[Guest]: And as for sushi bars or something, that again, like you need a really large city like Mumbai

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:14.160
[Guest]: or Bangalore for it to work because like, it's so niche that you need a really big population

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.600
[Guest]: in your catchment area for it to be like, commercially viable.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.560
[Amit Varma]: Like in another context, you've written in your book, there's a chapter where you write

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.640
[Amit Varma]: about feta cheese in Bangalore.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.640
[Amit Varma]: And while you know, feta cheese is available in very few places in Bangalore and Mumbai,

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.560
[Amit Varma]: like Nature's Basket, for example, it will be available in some places at a cost for

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.880
[Amit Varma]: those who want to pay that price and many do, I love feta cheese.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.280
[Amit Varma]: And you will never ever, you know, be able to find feta cheese in a small town in India,

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.400
[Amit Varma]: for example, at least not now.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:48.000
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, cities afford the kind of specialization and division of labor, which makes it profitable

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.480
[Amit Varma]: for individuals to go there.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:54.040
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, when Yahoo shut down in Bangalore, even if some of their operations might have

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.840
[Amit Varma]: been in an SEZ in Bangalore, just by dint of that location, those people were able to

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.480
[Amit Varma]: find jobs because they were already in that relatively liquid market, while the market

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.120
[Amit Varma]: in Sriparambudur was very illiquid.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.200
[Amit Varma]: There was it was an SEZ, there was one company there, and those guys simply couldn't find

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.200
[Amit Varma]: any other jobs.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.800
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, SEZs normally have many companies, but in this particular SEZ, they had one mobile

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.800
[Guest]: manufacturing company.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.320
[Guest]: And there was no other company which was similar to this company.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.360
[Guest]: So what happened was that like, I mean, so when you are working in a place where there's

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.120
[Guest]: one company of a particular type, and you lose your job for whatever reason, right,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.280
[Guest]: whether the company shuts down or you fight with your boss, or whatever happens, if you

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.160
[Guest]: lose your job, you have nowhere to go, you need to necessarily relocate.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.720
[Guest]: So you're kind of, so your life is necessarily kind of fragile, because it's kind of tied

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.480
[Guest]: to a particular employer and so on.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.680
[Guest]: On the other hand, if you're in a place where there is plenty of choice for employment,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.000
[Guest]: and then it's good both for you and for your employer, because let's say, for example,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.320
[Guest]: I'm like the head of engineering at a company located in some way, which has its office

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.640
[Guest]: in some village, right?

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.600
[Guest]: And I decide to leave someday, now, my employer will have a massive task to find another head

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.360
[Guest]: of engineering to replace me.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.600
[Guest]: But if I were the head of engineering in a place in Bangalore, and I left it and because

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.320
[Guest]: the market for engineers in Bangalore is liquid, it will hardly, the company is so much better

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.600
[Guest]: of being there, because it's very easy for them to replace me.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.600
[Guest]: So it works on both sides, both for the employer and for the employee, it works to be in a

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.600
[Guest]: big city, because there's more choice for both.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.440
[Guest]: And so like, the amount of risk they have to face is like significantly lower.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.800
[Amit Varma]: And that means a higher real estate costs completely worth it.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it's a no brainer, because the benefits are far more than the costs.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:43.600
[Guest]: Yeah, no, I mean, like, so people keep talking about how real estate in cities cost really

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.600
[Guest]: high.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.320
[Guest]: I know you've done a few, few great episodes on this podcast on real estate, I guess it's

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.640
[Guest]: best to put links to those.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:57.000
[Guest]: But a lot of cases, apart from in cases where supply has been artificially constrained for

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.360
[Guest]: whatever reason, like, I mean, the high real estate cost you pay, either in terms of like

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.000
[Guest]: the rent you pay, or in the small size of the dwellings, or in terms of the quality

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.800
[Guest]: of accommodation, it's a price that people are willing to pay, because the value they

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.800
[Guest]: get from being in a city is so much more.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, it actually illustrates how much value there is, because supply constraints

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.680
[Amit Varma]: to things like FSI and rent control.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.200
[Amit Varma]: And we've got previous episodes of the scene in the unseen, and that prices are much higher

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200
[Amit Varma]: than they should be.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.720
[Amit Varma]: But regardless of that, people would prefer to be in cities and in smaller places.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:30.000
[Amit Varma]: So coming to sort of the question of SEZs in particular, now, special economic zones

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.400
[Amit Varma]: or SEZs are often glorified by some people, because they said that, look, the scene effect

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.400
[Amit Varma]: of that is that you create a zone, which has lesser regulation than you have otherwise

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.400
[Amit Varma]: in cities.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.080
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you make it attractive for businesses to set up there.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.160
[Amit Varma]: And once they set up there, they generate employment and revenue, and it kind of helps

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160
[Amit Varma]: everyone.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.720
[Amit Varma]: And of course, that's begging the question about why those regulations aren't removed

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.040
[Amit Varma]: everywhere instead of just in SEZs.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.320
[Amit Varma]: But taking that for granted that they're going to remain the way they are, that is what many

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.240
[Amit Varma]: people call the scene effect of SEZs.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.280
[Amit Varma]: And according to you, one unseen effect of having SEZs in places like Sriparambudur or

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:13.280
[Amit Varma]: far far off areas is that you are not plugged into the network of a city.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.080
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the cost of business is actually much higher in SEZs.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.440
[Guest]: Yeah, so I mean, you were talking about generating employment, right?

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.200
[Guest]: I mean, yeah, they do generate employment, if you set up a plant anywhere, you obviously

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.000
[Guest]: need people to generate employment.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.360
[Guest]: But when you have set it up in a place where it's very fragile employment, I mean, like,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.880
[Guest]: it's very, you don't want to kind of tie your entire career and your life decisions to kind

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.640
[Guest]: of the fortunes of one company, which is set up a new plant in a particular place, right?

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.960
[Guest]: I mean, if the real motive is to generate employment, you need to kind of, you want

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.280
[Guest]: to generate employment that's more stable, that's more like kind of, and I mean, you

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.240
[Guest]: can't force companies to not shut down and so on.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.600
[Guest]: But what you want is to kind of generate employment, which can give some kind of stability where

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.600
[Guest]: the employee is hedged against something happening in the job and so on.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:07.400
[Guest]: Here, you generate employment, but it's very unstable employment, because from what the

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.400
[Guest]: Yahoo thing forces.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.320
[Guest]: And yes, there's no network in the city.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:16.080
[Guest]: So it's a very weird life that I personally haven't lived in a SEZ, so I can't really

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.080
[Guest]: comment.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:22.320
[Guest]: The only sense from what I read is that it's a very kind of a weird life there.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:28.680
[Guest]: So you probably create much more value, if all these people were to kind of, rather than

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:33.960
[Guest]: working in a SEZ, if they were to work in a big town or city, there will probably be

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.600
[Guest]: much more value being created, because there will be so many more things that are credible

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.160
[Guest]: there and like people are kind of creating much more value.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.000
[Amit Varma]: So would you recommend that when people set up SEZs, they should set it up only in big

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.440
[Amit Varma]: cities or would you go a step further and say that we need to re-look entirely at the

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.760
[Amit Varma]: concept of SEZs to begin with?

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.400
[Guest]: I think we need to re-look entirely at the concept of SEZs, because what happens is when

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.400
[Guest]: you try to give certain kind of, by the way, the Nokia closure again, it had to do with

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.200
[Guest]: the terms of the SEZ in which they were located.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.840
[Guest]: So I think, so when Nokia sold its manufacturing business to Microsoft back in 2014, they didn't

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.200
[Guest]: sell the Shri Perumal Dur plant because there was a litigation going on, because I think

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.880
[Guest]: there were some clauses in the SEZ saying, you can be here and get these benefits, if

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.520
[Guest]: and only if you export everything you make and it was not clear whether they were exporting

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:30.720
[Guest]: all the phones or if they were selling some phones in India, which is a completely mindless

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.720
[Guest]: regulation.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.360
[Guest]: But because of that, that plant didn't get sold to Microsoft.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:40.040
[Guest]: It might have, if those, if it was not because of, if the plant had not, let's say the plant

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.920
[Guest]: was still in Shri Perumal Dur, there was no other mobile manufacturing unit in India.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.280
[Guest]: So let's say for some good reason, they would have chosen to put it in Shri Perumal Dur,

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:53.160
[Guest]: which is still in a big manufacturing belt in Tamil Nadu.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.520
[Guest]: I think we have a good friend who runs a factory there.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:02.120
[Guest]: So there, like what would have happened is that it would have probably been sold to Microsoft

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.520
[Guest]: and had Microsoft bought the plant, there would have been so many other ways in which

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.760
[Guest]: they might have put it to good use.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.560
[Guest]: Maybe if they didn't want to make mobile phones, they would have used it to make keyboards

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.560
[Guest]: or whatever.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.560
[Guest]: Right.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.640
[Guest]: But because it was in an SEG, because it was set up with certain conditions, the whole

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:25.200
[Guest]: idea of the SEG is that you need to follow a certain list of conditions in order to qualify

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.360
[Guest]: for certain benefits and so on.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.360
[Guest]: It kind of restricts the kind of activity that you can do.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.960
[Guest]: So it's not only that, like there's not so much choice for employees and the company

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.000
[Guest]: in terms of recruiting people, finding jobs and so on.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.320
[Guest]: It's also too restrictive in terms of what you can do.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:46.320
[Guest]: It's almost back to the License Raj era where you had to take permission from the government

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.680
[Guest]: to manufacture a certain number of units of something and you couldn't make one more than

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.680
[Guest]: that.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.480
[Guest]: Here it's just that you can manufacture certain kinds of things and you can't make anything

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.480
[Guest]: else.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.440
[Guest]: So it's a very, very counterproductive regulation.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.720
[Guest]: But because it produces certain incentives, a lot of companies kind of end up taking those

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.720
[Amit Varma]: incentives for short term benefits.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.400
[Amit Varma]: So out of these two options, which I'm just thinking of the top of my head, out of these

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.480
[Amit Varma]: two options, which make more sense to you?

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:16.200
[Amit Varma]: One is that you keep SEGs, but you redesign the incentives in such a way that you don't

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.520
[Amit Varma]: have all these crazy cumbersome regulations and you keep them near cities or whatever.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:25.280
[Amit Varma]: And the second is that you do away with SEGs altogether because of the logic is that less

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.400
[Amit Varma]: regulation or better conditions will attract more businesses.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.400
[Amit Varma]: Since that is a positive sum game, just spread it out everywhere, offer it to everyone.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, everyone benefits from that, right?

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.880
[Guest]: So which seems more...

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.440
[Guest]: It's very clear to me that the second one is a better option because the first one involves

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.440
[Guest]: too much design.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:47.360
[Guest]: It involves too much intelligence on part of the designer, regulator who comes up with

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.360
[Guest]: these rules and so on.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.320
[Guest]: So if you kind of... and there's a very high chance of it kind of going wrong.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:19:00.160
[Guest]: So in that sense, it's okay if we are slow to move on labor reforms or whatever.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.160
[Guest]: It's okay.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.640
[Guest]: Because I think in the long run, I think what SEGs create is that they give you short-term

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:13.320
[Guest]: benefits in terms of tax benefits or freedom for a few years from certain labor regulations

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.320
[Guest]: and so on.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:19.120
[Guest]: And companies are very happy to bite on those short-run benefits and they end up locating

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.120
[Guest]: there.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.120
[Guest]: But it creates long-term problems.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:26.080
[Guest]: It doesn't result in kind of sustainable long-term growth, it doesn't result in sustainable long-term

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:31.240
[Guest]: improvement in regulation and all, it's a kind of a band-aid that you kind of put on

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.240
[Guest]: a deep cut.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:38.160
[Guest]: So you're better off kind of not having SEGs at all and yeah, in the short run, less jobs

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.160
[Guest]: might end up being created.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:44.520
[Guest]: But I think it's a more sustainable solution and you'll also see that the mainstream regulation

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.560
[Guest]: is easier to change when everybody's part of it and so on.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and this seems to go back, I think, to the central question of trying to centrally

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.960
[Amit Varma]: plan an economy.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:57.560
[Amit Varma]: Like an SEG seems to me to be a sort of a jugaad done by a central planner, while that

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.280
[Amit Varma]: should really not be the case, while cities arise organically from supply and demand and

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.920
[Amit Varma]: network effects and so on.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.040
[Amit Varma]: So the ideal role for governments, since they can never possibly have all the information

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:13.120
[Amit Varma]: available to them to run a market as, you know, Hayek explicated so brilliantly 80 years

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:18.360
[Amit Varma]: ago, is that just to take a hands-off approach and let things develop organically.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.760
[Amit Varma]: Karthik, thanks so much for coming on the show.
