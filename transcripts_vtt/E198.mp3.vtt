00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520
[Amit Varma]: What does it mean to be a citizen?

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.920
[Amit Varma]: More specifically, what does it mean to be a citizen in a city?

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.520
[Amit Varma]: Here are some things that we know about India.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.520
[Amit Varma]: 1.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.680
[Amit Varma]: India is more urban than we realize, and one day soon, most of India will live in its cities.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.680
[Amit Varma]: 2.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.680
[Amit Varma]: This is a good thing.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.960
[Amit Varma]: It's driven by the voluntary actions of people.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960
[Amit Varma]: 3.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.480
[Amit Varma]: All our governance is centralized and nowhere near as local as it should be.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.480
[Amit Varma]: 4.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.680
[Amit Varma]: Even though our democracy has endured, there is a mismatch between power and accountability

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.520
[Amit Varma]: at the local level.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.520
[Amit Varma]: 5.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.200
[Amit Varma]: Citizens in India are largely disempowered or at least feel disempowered, and the state

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.280
[Amit Varma]: is an imposing presence.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.840
[Amit Varma]: All of these raise the question, if our system of governance is broken because of a flaw

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.320
[Amit Varma]: in our democracy, what can we do to fix it?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.800
[Amit Varma]: Can citizens assert themselves and reclaim their rights?

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.600
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.600
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.440
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.440
[Amit Varma]: A few months ago in episode 160, I had a stimulating conversation about participatory democracy

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.880
[Amit Varma]: with the polymath thinker Ashwin Mahesh.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.360
[Amit Varma]: That was a hugely popular episode, and though it lasted around two and a half hours, it

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.800
[Amit Varma]: fell too short.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.440
[Amit Varma]: So I'm delighted to have Ashwin back on The Seen and the Unseen to chat about his thoughts

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.280
[Amit Varma]: on urban governance based on a paper and a presentation by him that will be linked from

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.280
[Amit Varma]: the show notes.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.960
[Amit Varma]: Ashwin is in some ways a perfect guest for the show because I like to digress and take

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.520
[Amit Varma]: the conversation into unexpected and different directions, and Ashwin's knowledge is both

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.260
[Amit Varma]: wide and deep.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.960
[Amit Varma]: So besides urban governance, we also chatted about the lockdown, how we should think about

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.200
[Amit Varma]: education in an out-of-the-box way, and the responsibility, helplessness, and incentives

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.200
[Amit Varma]: of citizens.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.080
[Amit Varma]: As tends to happen, the conversation got more and more fun as we went along, and we argued

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.880
[Amit Varma]: a lot in the last part of the show.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.260
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure there'll be much food for thought for everyone listening.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.860
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to the conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.400
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to The Seen and the Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.680
[Amit Varma]: show alive.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.720
[Amit Varma]: The Seen and the Unseen has been a labour of love for me.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.320
[Amit Varma]: I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.440
[Amit Varma]: and hopefully yours as well.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.640
[Amit Varma]: But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off the show.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.640
[Amit Varma]: Although The Seen and the Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.320
[Amit Varma]: up to the insane engagement level of podcasts, and I do many, many hours of deep research

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.920
[Amit Varma]: for each episode, besides all the logistics of producing the show myself – scheduling

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.240
[Amit Varma]: guests, booking studios, paying technicians, the travel, and so on.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.520
[Amit Varma]: So well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going, and that involves you.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.200
[Amit Varma]: My proposition for you is this – for every episode of The Seen and the Unseen that you

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.400
[Amit Varma]: enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.360
[Amit Varma]: You can do this by heading over to seenunseen.in slash support and contributing an amount of

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.360
[Amit Varma]: your choice.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.280
[Amit Varma]: This is not a subscription.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.320
[Amit Varma]: The Seen and the Unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at seenunseen.in.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.920
[Amit Varma]: This is just a gesture of appreciation.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.800
[Amit Varma]: Help keep this thing going.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.800
[Amit Varma]: Seenunseen.in slash support.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.200
[Amit Varma]: Ashwin, welcome to The Seen and the Unseen yet again.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.000
[Guest]: Well, my pleasure to be back, Amit.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.720
[Amit Varma]: So you know, the episode that we recorded a few months ago, episode 160 on participatory

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.120
[Amit Varma]: democracy, which will be linked from the show notes, was actually incredibly popular.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.880
[Amit Varma]: And you know, people still keep writing in about that.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.640
[Amit Varma]: And I did ask you a lot of questions about your personal journey in that episode, which

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.160
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to make you go through again, because we've already done that and listeners

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.320
[Amit Varma]: can listen to that.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.720
[Amit Varma]: But what I didn't explore in that episode was, you know, while we spoke about your career

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.320
[Amit Varma]: and your trajectory and how you, you know, got through the various interests and passions

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.760
[Amit Varma]: that brought you to where you are, we didn't speak one so much about your personal life.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.280
[Amit Varma]: And also, I'm interested in knowing, you know, how have you been through this lockdown?

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.280
[Amit Varma]: What's life been like?

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.600
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about family, about home, about what you do in your downtime?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:38.040
[Guest]: Well, I mean, I guess I'm not that different from millions of other people, both in terms

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:46.120
[Guest]: of regular home life and also in terms of how that has been impacted by the pandemic.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:54.240
[Guest]: I have two school going children, and therefore, there's a new rhythm that needs to be established

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.120
[Guest]: around that.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:03.880
[Guest]: It's fortunate that many of my kids' friends from school live in the community where I

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.880
[Guest]: live.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.960
[Guest]: So, in some sense, there is a semblance of continuity from the school environment.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.400
[Guest]: And it's also a small school, it doesn't have very many students.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.000
[Guest]: So in that sense, having a subset of kids in your own community, it's a larger subset

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.800
[Guest]: than it would be for any other school in some way, in percentage terms.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.880
[Guest]: And so, I think they're managing okay, but they'd like to be able to go to school once

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.880
[Guest]: in a while.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.360
[Guest]: And the school even, I think, might allow occasional visits by parents just sort of

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.400
[Unknown]: for kids and parents to remember what the school is like and stuff like that.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.400
[Guest]: But you know, on the whole, all of us have to be responsible through this pandemic.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.840
[Guest]: And there's not a whole lot anyone seems to be able to do other than wait.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.520
[Guest]: It's not always clear what one is waiting for.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.560
[Guest]: But in a way, there's a lot of waiting, certainly.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.360
[Guest]: Mostly, a combination of things that I do can still be done from home, whether it's

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.960
[Guest]: for Mapunity, or for India Together, or for any of the other things I'm involved in.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:20.920
[Guest]: Obviously, the work at Lithium required a lot of hands-on work, but I've finally reached

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.760
[Guest]: the stage where that's probably best done by another set of professional people.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.520
[Guest]: I'm thinking more and more about coming back to the public problem-solving things that

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.800
[Guest]: interest me personally.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.880
[Unknown]: And in that sense, the pandemic has given me an opportunity to think about how to reconnect

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.840
[Guest]: with some of the things that I haven't done as much of in the last couple of years.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.920
[Guest]: A lot of the work in the last couple of years has been around the electric vehicles stuff

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.920
[Guest]: at Lithium.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:53.200
[Guest]: But I really have been wanting to get back to Mapunity in particular, and also my interest

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.600
[Guest]: in public interest media.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.440
[Guest]: And I think both of those decisions were in some ways accelerated by the time available

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.040
[Guest]: to think about these sorts of things in a pandemic.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.480
[Guest]: And the municipal election is coming up here in Bangalore in, I don't know, in April.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.160
[Guest]: That's part of the things we'll talk about, not really clear how soon it will come up.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.560
[Guest]: But that's another opportunity to sort of be part of and influence the thinking about

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:28.120
[Guest]: governance in the city, public participation, things that have always interested me in the

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.880
[Guest]: last 10, 15 years.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:38.640
[Guest]: So it's a nice pivotal moment in some ways.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.480
[Guest]: I think sort of at some level, the rest of it is, you know, one day at a time, trying

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.400
[Guest]: to see where all of this is going to lead and just responding to whatever happens in

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.400
[Guest]: some sense.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.920
[Guest]: It's not really clear if tomorrow is going to bring more bad news or some semblance of

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.920
[Guest]: good news.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:03.400
[Guest]: Vaccines seem to come and go in the news, a little bit like oscillations on a sine curve.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.160
[Guest]: So in a way, there's a lot of wait and watch.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:15.480
[Guest]: Some of my family members got COVID and that was not something I was sort of mentally prepared

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.480
[Guest]: for.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.360
[Guest]: And it takes you a while to sort of adjust to concerns like that.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.720
[Unknown]: It's one of those things where you sort of know that things like fatality rates are very

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:31.760
[Guest]: low, but once you get it or someone close to you gets it, you tend to forget the other

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.120
[Guest]: 98 or 99% and imagine yourself in the 1 or 2%.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.760
[Guest]: And those are anxious things.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:44.440
[Guest]: I've also, just because of the things I get involved in, I've had many, many experiences

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:52.360
[Guest]: with people whose need for treatment was acute, immediate, and yet they were not able to access

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.960
[Guest]: it for a variety of reasons.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:00.840
[Guest]: You know, young women getting thrown out of hospitals at midnight and multiple members

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.640
[Guest]: of families dying while waiting for care.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:12.920
[Guest]: These are terrible things to go through, even for someone who's not immediately impacted.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.760
[Guest]: And I imagine that these are really bad for the families that are experienced with them.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:26.400
[Guest]: What it tells us is that there is a tremendous price that we are paying for two things.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:33.240
[Guest]: Weak governance, not just in India, but around the world, and a really sharp disconnect between

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.120
[Guest]: the things that ought to matter and the things that seem to matter in political life.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:43.280
[Guest]: Around the world, frankly, you would think this is the kind of problem that ought not

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.280
[Guest]: to exist.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.960
[Guest]: It's a bit like climate change, right?

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:53.480
[Guest]: You think that a bunch of sensible people with sufficient decency and foresight ought

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.200
[Guest]: to be able to anticipate and solve a problem like that.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:05.200
[Guest]: But this whole sensible people with sufficient decency and foresight, it seems like a quest

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.600
[Guest]: for another planet or something like that.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:17.360
[Guest]: In a way, it's becoming harshly clear to a lot of people that somewhere along the narrative

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:24.120
[Guest]: of even democracy that we have built for ourselves, there are very large gaps, and those gaps

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.920
[Guest]: become apparent at times like this.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.440
[Guest]: And there is an important response that is needed to say, how are we going to bridge

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.440
[Guest]: those gaps?

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:41.000
[Guest]: How do we make sure that people in positions of authority are also responsible and actually

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.760
[Guest]: proactively do the things that we'd like them to do?

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:52.360
[Guest]: I think this pandemic really should provoke a lot more of us to asking those questions.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:58.000
[Guest]: Some of us have been fortunate not to have suffered terrible consequences as a result

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.920
[Guest]: of it, but it's now reached a stage where each of us knows at least several other people

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.920
[Guest]: who have suffered greatly.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:13.480
[Guest]: And really, that has been the difficult part of the pandemic, just knowing what else is

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:20.000
[Guest]: going on and also a sense of helplessness about the whole thing.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.560
[Guest]: I can imagine that if people like me who are reasonably well-connected with governance

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:32.240
[Guest]: systems feel this way, that for a lot of other people, just shutting it out of their minds

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.760
[Guest]: entirely seems the only option.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:41.520
[Guest]: And maybe that's what explains so much of the non-compliance with good practices that

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:47.960
[Guest]: people don't even want to think about at this point, because it's scary, it's not clear

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.360
[Guest]: what they should do.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.360
[Guest]: It's bizarre.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.240
[Guest]: The number of circumstances in which you have to do the right thing is so large that at

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:02.680
[Guest]: some point, people will just throw up their hands and say, hell, if it happens, it happens.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.680
[Guest]: It is scary.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.040
[Guest]: I'm hoping it's not going to be more than, initially I thought it was going to be a three,

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.960
[Guest]: six, nine month thing, but now it seems every day like it's going to be another three, six

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.680
[Guest]: or nine months rather than just three, six or nine months.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:26.040
[Guest]: I think we should prepare for coming out of this in a reasonable way only by the summer

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.920
[Guest]: of next year.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:33.120
[Guest]: The winter could be a difficult time globally.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.120
[Guest]: What else can you do?

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.520
[Guest]: And there are certain parts of the economy, certain types of livelihoods that have been

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.200
[Guest]: massively impacted.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.160
[Guest]: And in India in particular, because we don't have the public systems to support people

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.280
[Guest]: through these kinds of downturns, a lot of people are vulnerable as a result.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:58.640
[Guest]: And I imagine that at least 50 million people have gone into poverty as a result of the

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.720
[Guest]: pandemic who previously would not have been thought of as poor people.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:12.280
[Guest]: And it has set back our development journey by at least six to 10 years in pure numerical

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.280
[Guest]: terms.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.440
[Guest]: A lot of that is true around the world.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.880
[Guest]: Like I said, at this point, you're reduced to living through it and finding your way

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.880
[Guest]: back each day at a time.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.880
[Amit Varma]: The economist, Abhisachi Kaur, I think he posted this graph on Twitter where he showed,

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, given certain assumptions about how much we will grow, how much, you know,

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.160
[Amit Varma]: COVID has set us back.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:42.320
[Amit Varma]: And I think his calculation was that it will take till 2033 until our economy goes to where

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.600
[Amit Varma]: it would otherwise have been in a time of normal growth at five and a half.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.320
[Amit Varma]: And he was calculating at COVID plus seven, something like that.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:54.640
[Amit Varma]: I was also kind of struck by what you said about people shutting it out because they

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.240
[Amit Varma]: simply can't understand what's going on.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.400
[Amit Varma]: So you shut it out and you're in denial and that leads you to behave in odd ways.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.180
[Amit Varma]: Because it strikes me that that is what we do in a sense in life itself.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:10.120
[Amit Varma]: That most people, you know, the very truth of our mortality, for example, or the complexity

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:15.920
[Amit Varma]: of the universe, which we can't possibly fathom is so scary that, you know, apart from doing

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.880
[Amit Varma]: things like inventing religions to build narratives to come to terms with it, we also sort of

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.880
[Amit Varma]: shut it out.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.200
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that this is kind of, in a sense, a more localized version of that,

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.140
[Amit Varma]: that certain things are not in your control.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.140
[Amit Varma]: So what do you do?

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.400
[Amit Varma]: You go in denial about it.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.400
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to sort of take a little Chinese box approach to the rest of the episode in

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.080
[Amit Varma]: the sense that the core of the episode and what I would really like to talk about, obviously,

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.880
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, urban governance and your ideas on how cities and urban governance should

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.920
[Amit Varma]: be reformed and all of that.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.440
[Amit Varma]: Before I get to that, I also want to talk a bit about map unity and lithium and, you

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.620
[Amit Varma]: know, briefly discuss that.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:58.120
[Amit Varma]: But before even that, I kind of want to come back to the earlier question of what you do

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.760
[Amit Varma]: in your downtime, because just, you know, something that I've been thinking about recently

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:07.640
[Amit Varma]: also is that these seemingly inconsequential choices that we often make at a personal level

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.400
[Amit Varma]: of how will I spend my time?

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400
[Amit Varma]: Will I read a book?

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.640
[Amit Varma]: Will I, you know, play a game on my mobile?

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.360
[Amit Varma]: Will I check Twitter obsessively to see who's trolling me now?

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.600
[Amit Varma]: Will I watch something on Netflix or will I listen to a podcast and go running?

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.040
[Amit Varma]: All of these choices are actually far more consequential than we imagine, because over

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.360
[Amit Varma]: a period of time, they sort of shape our thinking and they shape who we are.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.640
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, these seemingly trivial choices make all the difference.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:39.920
[Amit Varma]: I'm curious about one, do you think consciously about, you know, your productivity, for example,

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.460
[Amit Varma]: and how you spend your day and how you divide your time?

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.560
[Amit Varma]: And also, what do you do in your downtime to relax?

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.920
[Amit Varma]: And what are your guilty pleasures?

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.320
[Amit Varma]: Do you spend three hours every day surfing music videos on YouTube, as some of us do?

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.640
[Amit Varma]: What's, you know, tell me, give me a sense of what that is like.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:16:01.200
[Guest]: Well, you remember from our earlier conversation, my 15 minutes to 20 minutes every day of trying

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.080
[Guest]: to do a few things that keep a certain rhythm to my life.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.720
[Guest]: I still try to do that.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:14.120
[Guest]: And I don't think that gets affected very much by a pandemic, even.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.400
[Guest]: It's kind of odd to say that even a pandemic doesn't affect something.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:23.960
[Guest]: But since it's only 15-20 minutes a day, I'm able to do that, definitely.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.680
[Guest]: One of the things that has come down is the ability to meet strangers, and I'm trying

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.880
[Guest]: to be more deliberate about that, especially online.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:40.960
[Guest]: But broadly, what I find is that in some way, not needing to travel as much has actually

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:47.880
[Guest]: opened up time to do things that otherwise go in simply commuting or travel.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.600
[Guest]: And some things have happened, I think, because I have the additional time.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.160
[Guest]: I've been able to think more carefully about education, for example, and it's an interesting

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.640
[Guest]: time to think about education because the whole education framework has now collapsed

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.840
[Guest]: as a result of the pandemic.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:11.520
[Guest]: And all our assumptions about the delivery and the governance of education, especially

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.840
[Guest]: public education, have entirely gone for a toss.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:21.600
[Guest]: And if we are smart about this, we will take the opportunity to reimagine education.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.560
[Guest]: But even without that, there's an increasing set of choices that people are starting to

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:33.200
[Guest]: make for their own learning, which I think will radically alter the landscape of learning.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.080
[Guest]: And that's something that I've been able to spend more time thinking about because of

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.960
[Guest]: the pandemic.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.520
[Guest]: I shut down the office because of the pandemic.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.800
[Guest]: It didn't seem like it was worth paying rent to keep up an establishment.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:55.640
[Guest]: I instead rented the neighboring flat, which is actually a much more useful way to spend

00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:01.720
[Guest]: the same amount of money because it gives you close by additional space to work out

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.840
[Guest]: of and also have as a personal space.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.880
[Guest]: So people at home are not complaining that you're always on the phone or always on the

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.440
[Guest]: computer and there are enough spaces to do that quietly.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:19.040
[Guest]: So I'm sort of able to have even this conversation with you for more than a couple of hours without

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.520
[Guest]: worrying that anyone's going to get annoyed about that.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:31.640
[Guest]: So things like that, I think of certain adjustments that people make, educate each of us about

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.600
[Unknown]: what the alternatives could be, the things that we've previously taken for granted.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:42.360
[Guest]: You have to go to an office, you have to work certain times of the day, work in certain

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.960
[Guest]: ways, you have to have face-to-face meetings.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:50.480
[Guest]: All of these things are under tremendous reassessment and scrutiny now.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.600
[Guest]: And it seems like at least 60% of what we did previously was probably not as useful

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.080
[Guest]: as we thought it was.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.840
[Guest]: And so you could imagine it being different.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:07.040
[Guest]: I've always been in favor of a six and a half to seven hour workday.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.000
[Guest]: And I generally don't think that people can be productive beyond that anyway.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.760
[Guest]: Even school days, I think shouldn't be more than four and a half to five hours.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.120
[Guest]: I can't imagine that you can send kids to six and seven hours of school and think that

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.040
[Guest]: you're adding to their learning beyond the first three or four hours.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:32.160
[Guest]: So I think this reconstruction of time for various purposes is really the big thing that

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.160
[Guest]: I've been toying with during the pandemic.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:40.240
[Guest]: Of late, I've started going out a little bit more and meeting more people and feeling comfortable

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.240
[Guest]: about that.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:47.480
[Guest]: I also know that in doing that, all of us are taking risks, both for ourselves and unfortunately

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.480
[Guest]: for others too.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.960
[Guest]: There's no way to come out of this without that risk.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.960
[Guest]: And some of it is, you can tell yourself it's a calculated risk, but if you don't know the

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.520
[Guest]: formula, it's difficult to tell what a calculation will lead you to.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:10.160
[Guest]: I feel like we're taking calculated risks without knowing the equation itself, but it

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.160
[Guest]: is what it is.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.720
[Guest]: I've been reading huge stacks of books that have piled up over the years where I would

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.520
[Guest]: – and normally when I buy a book, I write down the date on which I buy the book and

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.800
[Guest]: try to see when I actually get around to reading it.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:30.600
[Guest]: And if those gaps are more than 18 months or 24 months, I slow down the book buying

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.200
[Guest]: telling myself that I'd better read the ones that I've already bought.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:41.880
[Guest]: I think now I've brought it down to six months or seven months of gap, which presumably that's

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.520
[Unknown]: because I've been able to read a lot more.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.360
[Guest]: And I have some neighbors who seem to read five times as fast as I do, probably as fast

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.360
[Guest]: as you do.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:56.080
[Guest]: And so that motivates me to talk to them about what they're reading and read some of those

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.080
[Guest]: things as well.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.920
[Guest]: I've been watching a lot of the TED Talks.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:06.280
[Guest]: For no particular reason, I just kind of randomly pick one and watch that.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:11.880
[Guest]: It's amazing what a variety of topics get covered in TED.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:18.560
[Guest]: Many, many years ago, when I first got introduced to CRISP by one of my friends, it seemed like

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:24.440
[Guest]: it was really a platform for ideas, and each of those ideas was a very powerful thing.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.320
[Guest]: I think today it's become even more than that.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.520
[Guest]: It's not just a platform for ideas.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:35.560
[Guest]: It's even a platform for stances that people take towards many things.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.400
[Guest]: And therefore, it sort of lets you think powerfully about each of those as well.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.920
[Guest]: You may agree, you may not agree, but I think it's useful to have a forum like that, where

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:53.760
[Guest]: you can sort of see things that are stated provocatively and succinctly and ask yourself,

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.160
[Guest]: what do I think about that?

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:05.480
[Guest]: And also, I'm thinking more about Bill Drayton's idea of cognitive empathy, where he says...

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:10.400
[Guest]: Bill Drayton started the Ashoka Fellowship, the Social Entrepreneurship Fellowship around

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:18.560
[Guest]: the world, and he talks about this idea of not just caring about others, but actively

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:25.760
[Guest]: doing something that allows you to feel that your empathy is cognitive as well, rather

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:30.120
[Guest]: than merely an acknowledgement of other people's difficulties.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.880
[Guest]: And so, you can take problem after problem and ask yourself, what's the difference between

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.800
[Guest]: mere empathy and cognitive empathy?

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:43.320
[Guest]: And how I can be closer to the second one than to the first one?

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.200
[Guest]: And God knows there are enough problems to work on.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:53.000
[Guest]: So you can say, if I care about public education, what are three things that I ought to be doing

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.480
[Unknown]: to convince myself that I actually care about this?

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.480
[Unknown]: I think a lot of people...

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.480
[Unknown]: We're seeing this.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:05.080
[Guest]: A lot of people care about a lot of things, but if you probe the extent to which they're

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:10.160
[Guest]: acting on what they care about, it doesn't often reflect the extent to which they say

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160
[Guest]: they care about it.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.600
[Guest]: I don't think that makes them hypocritical.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:21.400
[Guest]: I think it just means that there is still one more step that they need to take.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.840
[Guest]: And I've sort of been learning about such deliberate steps and how to take them.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:31.040
[Guest]: So a lot of the day gets filled up in simply saying, how many deliberate steps can I take

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:36.600
[Guest]: that I actually don't need to take to continue with my life, but which I think are important

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.440
[Guest]: to take, interesting to take, things like that.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.440
[Guest]: And there are certain things you can't do.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.440
[Guest]: You can't go swimming.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.720
[Guest]: You can't go whatever, five other things that you would otherwise have done.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.040
[Guest]: So that frees up time for stuff like that.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:55.040
[Guest]: I thought about getting an exercise machine at home and then decided that that was probably

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.040
[Guest]: overkill.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:03.240
[Guest]: And I somehow don't see myself doing that very often, even if I were to get that machine.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:08.480
[Guest]: But be that as it may, I think we've come to a very different imagination of time because

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:15.200
[Guest]: almost a year is now going to go by in our lives as a result of the pandemic in ways

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.120
[Guest]: that we did not anticipate at all.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.320
[Guest]: And a year is a very long time.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.600
[Amit Varma]: I'm glad you're not getting an exercise machine, because if I could turn my laptop camera right

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.360
[Amit Varma]: now, I could show you an elliptical in the corner and, you know, there's jeans hanging

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.560
[Amit Varma]: from the handle and there's a pair of old shoes on the stepper.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:35.440
[Amit Varma]: And that's clearly, you know, not something that's worked for me, at least.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.800
[Amit Varma]: I was, you know, also struck by how you spoke about, you know, reduce work hours and we

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.120
[Amit Varma]: don't really need so many hours.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.760
[Amit Varma]: And I just came across this quote today morning, this tweet, in fact, by Naval Ravikant, where

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:49.960
[Amit Varma]: he says, and I'll read it out quote, you don't have eight creative problem solving hours

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.960
[Amit Varma]: in the day.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.720
[Amit Varma]: You have to spend your time wisely, a strop quote.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.960
[Amit Varma]: And this kind of strikes me because more and more as I try to get more done with my time,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.600
[Amit Varma]: I realized that my best hours are when I wake up and I'm fresh in the morning and I absolutely

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.240
[Amit Varma]: have to maximize that and all of those things.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.600
[Amit Varma]: And the reason this quote was even handy for me, and I thought I'd ask you about this,

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.520
[Amit Varma]: because this again came to mind when you spoke about watching TED Talks, is one of the things

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.160
[Amit Varma]: I've been, again, thinking about recently is that, look, I might read a lot of books

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.320
[Amit Varma]: and I might watch a lot of videos and I might get in different amounts of knowledge and

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.080
[Amit Varma]: insight from elsewhere, but how do I retain it?

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.920
[Amit Varma]: And especially as I go deeper into middle age, my memory is just horrible and I'll just

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.160
[Amit Varma]: forget a lot of stuff.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:36.360
[Amit Varma]: And I am very struck, therefore, by this concept of the second brain, which, you know, I think

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:41.840
[Amit Varma]: pioneered by someone called Tiago Forte, where the idea is that you use tools and you use

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:47.440
[Amit Varma]: apps, so all the knowledge that you're gathering, you kind of collate them in, you know, what

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:52.320
[Amit Varma]: he describes as a second brain, which is a collection of apps and tools which helps you

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.320
[Amit Varma]: keep all of this together.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.080
[Amit Varma]: So in fact, what I've recently been doing a lot is using this incredible app called

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.680
[Amit Varma]: Rome Research, where anytime I watch a TED Talk, for example, which I like, I'll actually

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.160
[Amit Varma]: take notes from it.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.880
[Amit Varma]: And it has nesting, it has bidirectional linking.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.200
[Amit Varma]: So it is always there.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.440
[Amit Varma]: Earlier, when I took notes on books, for example, for my research or whatever, there would be

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.040
[Amit Varma]: disconnected word documents and so on and so forth.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.720
[Amit Varma]: But here, you know, I've got a master doc, which says, Ashwin Mahesh, and I might have

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.600
[Amit Varma]: links from the notes from the episode we did together.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.080
[Amit Varma]: And I might have further notes from the paper you sent me, the presentation you sent me

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.960
[Amit Varma]: before we recorded this episode.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.200
[Amit Varma]: And it's all there forever.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.800
[Amit Varma]: It's linked back and forth.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.160
[Amit Varma]: And it's quite kind of wonderful.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.880
[Amit Varma]: Do you have, you know, since your thinking is so systemic and clear, do you also have

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:46.320
[Amit Varma]: ways of sort of making sure that you sort of retain your knowledge and insights from

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.440
[Amit Varma]: all the reading that you do and the watching that you do?

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:55.520
[Guest]: Well, I wish I could say yes, but you know, the answer is probably closer to no than yes.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.280
[Guest]: What I had tried to do off late, though, is try to change that.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:07.080
[Guest]: And I sort of forced myself into accepting certain things as useful instruments for that

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.080
[Guest]: change.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:14.240
[Guest]: And I've decided that teaching what I know is a useful instrument for such change.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.760
[Guest]: Because in order to teach, I first have to write down what it is that I know.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:26.200
[Guest]: And that sort of gets me into some part of the documentation, organization of what I

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:31.120
[Guest]: know, so that I can then subsequently tell it to a few more people.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:37.360
[Unknown]: There are schools of public policy, schools of problem solving, you know, professors interested

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.520
[Guest]: in problem solving courses.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:46.840
[Guest]: So I've started collaborating with a few of them, and in 2021, in particular, I plan to

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:51.960
[Guest]: teach at least in three different such environments.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.880
[Guest]: And hopefully, the act of doing that helps.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:02.680
[Guest]: Also, I've sort of tried to document some things on my website, just because of the

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:07.040
[Guest]: diversity of things I get into, sort of just as a way of organizing my thoughts.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:12.880
[Guest]: And also, as a way of repeatedly asking, what are the ideas that inform the actions?

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.840
[Guest]: Because you can get into a lot of actions without asking yourself what ideas inform

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:23.200
[Unknown]: your actions, or what ideas you're coming to as a result of your actions, or even what

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.080
[Guest]: ideas you appear to be endorsing as a result of your actions.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:33.880
[Guest]: So I actually sort of have spent some time putting that material together on the website.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:41.640
[Guest]: And yeah, I think some discipline in documentation will arise as a result of all this in the

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.080
[Guest]: next six months, at least.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.640
[Guest]: It remains to be seen whether I can sustain that.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.320
[Guest]: Sometimes you put the first material together.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:54.120
[Guest]: I taught a course at IAM many years ago called Reinventing Government.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.000
[Guest]: After three years, I decided that the course material itself needed reinventing.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.240
[Guest]: So in a way, you can take good first steps in any direction.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.920
[Guest]: But really, it is quite important to keep taking those second steps and third steps,

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.720
[Guest]: which make the first step meaningful.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:18.280
[Guest]: Otherwise, you can sort of take lots of journeys of first steps and never get anywhere.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.880
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned that you were also sort of thinking about education deeply because

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.880
[Amit Varma]: of the pandemic.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.920
[Amit Varma]: And at some level, you know, we can see the surface reasons and the first order reasons

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.720
[Amit Varma]: for thinking about education, because obviously, instead of going to a school physically, kids

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.080
[Amit Varma]: are, you know, getting educated on Zoom.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.280
[Amit Varma]: But I have, and again, I'd like to know your thoughts on this, because, you know, it struck

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:44.880
[Amit Varma]: me for a while that our education system is incredibly outdated in every possible way,

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.160
[Amit Varma]: not just the obvious ones, that we are stuck with the inertia of the past, that in a sense,

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, economists call about isomorphic mimicry, which is you take a policy from another

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.060
[Amit Varma]: place, and you try to implement it wherever you are.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:01.240
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that there is also a version of that happening across time, where something

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:07.580
[Amit Varma]: that worked at one time or that made intuitive sense is completely unsuited to another time.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:12.000
[Amit Varma]: And we simply we just assume that our kids will go to school for 10 years or 12 years

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.360
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, they will be college, these will be the subjects, these will be the social

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:21.720
[Amit Varma]: sciences in their different silos, these will be the whatever and you know, one of the consequences

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:27.440
[Amit Varma]: of that not working that being dysfunctional, in a sense, is that part of our jobs prices

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:32.480
[Amit Varma]: is that one, of course, there aren't enough jobs, but also that a lot of the people who

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:38.380
[Amit Varma]: are getting degrees, including higher education degrees, have no skills, they are in equipped

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.680
[Amit Varma]: for anything in the real world.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:45.960
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that at some level, the pandemic might be an opportunity to really

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:51.800
[Amit Varma]: sit down and cast away the inertia of the past and think anew about, you know, everything

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.200
[Amit Varma]: from the bottom up.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.200
[Amit Varma]: What are your sort of thoughts on this?

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.120
[Amit Varma]: Because you mentioned you've been thinking a lot about this.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.120
[Amit Varma]: So you know?

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.120
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:07.400
[Guest]: So the conclusion, or at least one conclusion I've come to, is that we have failed to ask

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:16.000
[Guest]: and answer an important question, and that question is, who should teach?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.760
[Guest]: It's an interesting question, if you think about it, who should teach?

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:24.280
[Guest]: We'll come to all the other things later, where they should teach, how they should teach,

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.000
[Guest]: and all of that, but who should teach?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.880
[Guest]: It seems logical to say that people who know things should teach, if you don't have anything

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.400
[Guest]: to teach.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:42.240
[Guest]: So and therefore, what the pandemic has essentially created is a situation where merely knowing

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.760
[Guest]: things is enough to be allowed to teach.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:51.280
[Guest]: And of course, to some extent, even before the pandemic, MOOCs and Coursera and 20 other

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.360
[Guest]: things had begun to make that possible.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:03.880
[Guest]: Essentially saying to the formal system that the way in which you decide who should teach

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:10.120
[Guest]: is unacceptable to me, because what the formal systems have done is they have connected too

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:14.240
[Guest]: many other questions to this question.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:20.960
[Guest]: So if Amit should teach, because he knows, let's say, podcasting.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:26.320
[Guest]: So if Amit should teach podcasting, where should he teach podcasting?

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:32.320
[Guest]: If he taught it online in a loosely certified way, that's one thing, but for you to teach

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:39.520
[Guest]: podcasting in a quote-unquote recognized institution is much, much harder when you think about

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.520
[Guest]: it.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:47.920
[Guest]: You might be the king of podcasting, and you're pretty close to it, but the thing is that

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:54.960
[Guest]: you wouldn't be allowed to teach this in a formal setting as it stands now, because the

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.200
[Guest]: setting doesn't permit that anymore.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:03.880
[Guest]: The second thing is that you could turn the question on its head and say, who should you

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.880
[Guest]: teach?

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.920
[Guest]: So who should you teach?

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:13.240
[Guest]: So let's say that Amit is 16 years old and he wants to be a cricket player, and what

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.240
[Guest]: should you teach him?

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:20.360
[Guest]: Chemistry and mathematics and history or a lot of cricket, and maybe cricket statistics

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:26.240
[Guest]: and cricket broadcasting and cricket commentary and cricket sports medicine and things like

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.240
[Guest]: that.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:35.160
[Guest]: Actually, I think we've gone from the important question to the unimportant ones really quickly,

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:40.440
[Guest]: and the unimportant ones are easier for governments to get a grip on, and that's really why they've

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.440
[Guest]: gone to the unimportant ones.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.440
[Guest]: Historically, in fact, if you thought about it, people who knew things taught.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:52.040
[Guest]: That's all it was, there wasn't any blessing for that beyond the fact that they knew things.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:58.440
[Guest]: But with mass education in particular, has come the expectation that there should be

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.540
[Guest]: controls and filters on who should teach.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:08.040
[Guest]: So certification has become a big part of the teaching, being allowed to teach.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:13.440
[Guest]: But certification, I mean, I remember a friend of mine that I am telling me that in India,

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.680
[Guest]: we probably have the world's largest gap between certification and learning.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:22.640
[Guest]: Just because someone has a certificate doesn't mean that they actually know anything.

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.200
[Guest]: You've seen news reports about students taking exams in Bihar, where they're climbing in

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.600
[Guest]: and out of windows to be able to copy from each other.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:36.440
[Guest]: And you're thinking, surely this isn't anything that any employer will find credible.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:42.680
[Guest]: And so I think what the pandemic has done is it has basically turned the system on its

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:49.920
[Guest]: head and said, no one really took you seriously anyway, now they don't even have to take you

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.920
[Guest]: seriously.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:57.840
[Guest]: But there are people who still say this is just for the elite, maybe 10% of the population

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:03.040
[Guest]: can make choices like this, 90% of the population can't make choices that are any different

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:08.520
[Guest]: from the conventional ones available from the 1500s or the 1600s.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:15.400
[Guest]: That's probably still true, but new things, when you look at even MOOCs and online education,

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.400
[Unknown]: they weren't very big 10, 15 years ago.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:25.160
[Unknown]: But two years ago, I read somewhere that 20% of all degrees being given online, the MOOCs

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:30.200
[Guest]: were giving out at least that many certificates as 20% of all physical degrees.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:36.360
[Guest]: So in a way, the numbers are growing, the modularity of learning is expanding.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:43.000
[Guest]: That's an important thing, that this tight correlation between your age and the intensity

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.360
[Guest]: of your learning.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:51.400
[Guest]: So if you were to try to learn basic English at age 11, people would find that odd and

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.360
[Guest]: ask why haven't you learned it earlier?

00:35:54.360 --> 00:36:00.640
[Guest]: Or even if you were basic Hindi or basic Kannada, whatever, whatever be your medium of instruction,

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.280
[Guest]: people would find it odd that you haven't learned it.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:07.640
[Guest]: But if you were to learn basic Russian at age 11 in India, nobody would think that there's

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.640
[Unknown]: anything wrong.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.800
[Guest]: In fact, you could learn basic Russian at age 61, and nobody would think that there's

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.800
[Guest]: anything wrong with that.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.240
[Guest]: I actually think there's nothing wrong with learning basic physics when you're 61 too,

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.000
[Guest]: or learning basic mathematics when you're 61 too.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.320
[Guest]: But we have a system of learning that has tightly coupled age to learning.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:33.880
[Guest]: And not only that, it has sort of bracketed those ages, all 15-year-olds are in whatever,

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:39.920
[Guest]: 10th grade, all 13-year-olds are in 8th grade, so on and so forth, which is a bizarre thing

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.360
[Guest]: in some way.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:51.640
[Guest]: Education is too important and too personal to the learner to expect that any form of

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.200
[Guest]: it can result in learning through conformity.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:03.000
[Guest]: The system demands that we abandon conformity, but conformity is the thing that the state

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.360
[Guest]: likes, the state is comfortable with, and that is the tension that needs to be sorted

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.360
[Guest]: now.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:17.600
[Guest]: I sort of, especially with Ken Robinson passing away this year, I spent a lot of time reading

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:23.320
[Guest]: and watching him, and my sense of it is that we're still not comfortable, and this has

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.680
[Guest]: parallels with governance in general, we're still not comfortable trusting the school

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.440
[Guest]: administrator or the school principal in a public school system.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:37.240
[Guest]: We're still thinking that the school administrator and the school principal is just a delivery

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:42.760
[Guest]: agent of something that is decided at a much higher level, and no educational institution

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.880
[Guest]: can become good through that stance.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.120
[Guest]: I feel we have to, and it's the same thing that we see with decentralization of other

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:58.840
[Guest]: things too, that fundamentally people in a locality are not empowered to be part of decision

00:37:58.840 --> 00:37:59.840
[Guest]: making in that locality.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:08.520
[Guest]: There is no force on earth that can fundamentally help produce good outcomes despite that, and

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:13.120
[Guest]: we keep thinking that state governments and national governments are going to solve hyperlocal

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.120
[Guest]: problems.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.960
[Guest]: They're not going to solve hyperlocal problems.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:21.080
[Guest]: They have even no visibility into those problems, they have no capacity to respond to those

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.080
[Guest]: problems.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.080
[Guest]: A lot of people think that in India the national government is going to solve a lot of problems.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:29.320
[Unknown]: The national government doesn't even have the staff to solve 90% of the problems that

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.800
[Guest]: people care about.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.360
[Guest]: Even the few schemes that they run are actually implemented by state governments.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:41.880
[Guest]: So in a way, I don't think that we have any capacity for problem solving in administration,

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:47.560
[Guest]: in public administration, that can be separated from decentralization, and that is really

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:57.160
[Guest]: the problem, that there is a tension between the growing numbers of people moving to cities

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:04.360
[Guest]: and the large agglomerations that produces, and the reality that despite such agglomeration,

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:09.320
[Guest]: it is decentralized participatory problem solving that is actually going to make even

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.520
[Guest]: those agglomerations work well.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:17.920
[Guest]: And I find that that is repeatedly true in many, many disciplines.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:23.960
[Guest]: Education is available in a very different way, but it still needs to be personal and

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.000
[Guest]: child-centered in some way.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.720
[Guest]: Skilling is thought of only as sort of an afterthought, that if you fail in formal education,

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:39.320
[Guest]: then you go to a vocational program, which is very silly because 90% of the jobs out

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.880
[Guest]: there are not jobs you would get through formal education anyway.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.880
[Guest]: If anything, vocational learning should be the norm, and only those who need more than

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:55.360
[Guest]: that should be going to formal learning, but we have the opposite system in many cases.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:05.360
[Guest]: So what I've been reflecting on is how comfortable we have become with the status quo, and why

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.440
[Guest]: systems of administration struggle to overcome the status quo.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:14.160
[Guest]: There's a very interesting experiment that was a professor at Harvard called Lant Pritchett.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.160
[Guest]: You might know Lant.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.400
[Unknown]: He worked for a while with the Administrative Reforms Commission, too.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.960
[Guest]: There was one interesting thing that he taught some of us, saying, look, if there are 25

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:28.120
[Guest]: things that need to change simultaneously, it's very difficult to figure out which one

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.680
[Guest]: you should touch first.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:36.600
[Guest]: And so the first exercise you do is to ask yourself, which of these 25 things has the

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.960
[Guest]: potential to have a domino effect on other things?

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.800
[Guest]: And you rank them in that order, and then decide which ones to touch and which ones

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.800
[Unknown]: not to touch.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.280
[Unknown]: So really, so for a lot of public problems, this is what I've been doing now.

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.680
[Unknown]: So here are 10 things that need to change, and as we talk about urbanization, we'll go

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:58.280
[Guest]: through 10, 15 things that need to change, but if you could only touch one of them, which

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:03.440
[Guest]: one would you touch, right, because you can't really touch 15 of them until you get into

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.440
[Guest]: government.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.680
[Guest]: And I've seen even friends of mine who get into government and even become chief ministers

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:14.120
[Guest]: sort of have difficulty in touching 15 things at the same time.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:19.840
[Guest]: So it's not only about power and authority and decision-making rights.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:26.000
[Guest]: It's about actually being able to carry that out in a system that is weak to begin with.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.560
[Unknown]: State capacity is very low.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.560
[Guest]: We have to accept that.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:33.560
[Guest]: And in a system where the state capacity is low, you can't really pull off all the things

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.400
[Guest]: that you would like to.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:43.760
[Guest]: The state is nonetheless not comfortable with a greater balance of power between itself

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:49.040
[Guest]: and market and society, and in fact, actively puts out the narrative that market and society

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.080
[Guest]: cannot be trusted.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:57.680
[Guest]: So in such a situation, it seems like what you're going to get is enduring underdevelopment.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.720
[Guest]: I mean, look at this election that's going on in Bihar.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:05.120
[Guest]: You have two major formations, each of whom has delivered 15 years of lost in the nation

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:09.960
[Guest]: status to that state, and they are the leading contenders for power.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:17.960
[Guest]: It's a very sad thing that somehow we have allowed ourselves to arrive at a situation

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.920
[Guest]: which is deeply hostile to the public interest.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:27.560
[Guest]: But any step that you would take to correct it, it seems like it can only be effective

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:33.240
[Guest]: if 10 other steps are also taken at the same time, and people find the enormity of all

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:39.720
[Guest]: that too much, and they just throw up their hands, which perpetuates the problem further.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.840
[Unknown]: So this is the cycle that you have to overcome, and this is one of the things that I sort

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:49.120
[Unknown]: of, you know, I'm thinking of this Center for Public Problem Solving, right?

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.680
[Unknown]: So what is the Center for Public Problem Solving, and what is the problem that it's trying to

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.680
[Guest]: overcome?

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:58.520
[Guest]: It's not actually the employability deficit or the governance deficit or whatever.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.960
[Guest]: The problem is not the sectoral thing.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:07.000
[Guest]: The problem is how we have organized problem solving itself, right?

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.240
[Guest]: If you look at, let's go into organization with a good segue from here.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:20.760
[Guest]: If I were to ask you, how many levels of government are there in the constitution and in the laws?

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.760
[Amit Varma]: What would you say?

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.160
[Amit Varma]: I'll think of, you know, in practical terms, what are the effects that we see, and of course

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.960
[Amit Varma]: we see the central level and the state level, and after the 74th amendment, which of course

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:34.520
[Amit Varma]: we'll discuss in much more detail, maybe, you know, a couple of levels below that, but

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.920
[Guest]: that's as far as my understanding would go.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.920
[Guest]: Okay.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.320
[Guest]: So most people will say that central, state, and local, right?

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:47.360
[Guest]: But there are actually five levels of governance that are in the constitution and in the law.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:53.000
[Guest]: There is the metropolitan planning level, especially for the larger cities, which exists

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.960
[Guest]: in the law, but not in practice.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.280
[Unknown]: There is also participatory democracy at the local level, which again exists in the law,

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:05.840
[Guest]: but is very weak at the local level, and participatory democracy in particular, both the planning

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:12.960
[Guest]: level and the participatory level, people think of these things as good to have.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:18.360
[Guest]: They're not just good to have, these are must have, and they are required by law.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.600
[Guest]: Nobody thinks that the state government is good to have.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.040
[Guest]: They accept that the state government is a must have.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.120
[Guest]: Nobody thinks that the central government is just good to have.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.200
[Guest]: They accept that it's a must have.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.520
[Guest]: But there are other things in the law that we simply tell ourselves, these are good to

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:35.240
[Guest]: have, but it's all right if we don't have them, or somehow we seem to be able to go

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.840
[Guest]: forward without having them.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:43.400
[Guest]: If an election was not held to a state assembly on time, that would be quite a decision.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:49.800
[Unknown]: But if an election is not held to a local council or a planning body, that seems like

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.280
[Guest]: okay, it'll sort of drift on, it'll be sorted out by the courts.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.520
[Guest]: We don't have an elected council now here in Bangalore, for example, and while one set

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:04.080
[Guest]: of people are not happy about that, it isn't creating the kind of uproar that the lack

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.840
[Guest]: of a state government or the lack of a national government would.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:12.520
[Guest]: There have even been court decisions that local administration is just administration

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:18.600
[Guest]: and can't even be considered government, which is, these are real challenges, that how we

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:26.640
[Guest]: think about the structure of government and how we participate is more or less central

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.360
[Guest]: to what we'll actually get from it.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.320
[Guest]: That we have a very interesting narrative, for example, we think that India is going

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.880
[Guest]: to become a superpower and then everybody's going to get educated.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:42.960
[Guest]: So it's almost like we expect to arrive at a development outcome before the people of

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:50.440
[Guest]: the country become developed, and that's a bizarre notion, but it's quite prevalent that

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:54.440
[Guest]: a lot of people subscribe to that, or even if they don't say it explicitly, they seem

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.160
[Guest]: to believe that's how it's going to happen.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:03.080
[Guest]: So what I think it's worth dwelling on and spending a lot of time thinking about is essentially

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.720
[Guest]: this idea of how have we organized ourselves as a society?

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.960
[Guest]: Why have we organized ourselves in this way?

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.200
[Guest]: Who is it deeply unfair to?

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:17.400
[Guest]: In what ways is it inefficient and just unproductive?

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.920
[Guest]: And why are we doing this to ourselves?

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.000
[Guest]: We're not doing this to other people, we're doing this to ourselves.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.320
[Guest]: There's a reason why the street outside your house looks the way it does.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:35.240
[Guest]: That reason is not some imaginary or actual war with a foreign country, or being struck

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.560
[Guest]: by an asteroid, or any of those sorts of things.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:45.360
[Guest]: It's something we have done to ourselves, and therefore I think it's important to be

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:51.160
[Guest]: deliberate in first stopping to do those things to ourselves, and then starting to do another

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.680
[Guest]: set of things that can change.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:47:01.600
[Guest]: And I really think that urbanization provides a phenomenal opportunity to examine that and

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:05.640
[Guest]: to actually act in that sphere of influence.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:11.000
[Unknown]: And so this has been the fascination for me, that frankly, I got into urbanization as an

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
[Guest]: ignoramus.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.160
[Guest]: I was a climate scientist, I didn't know anything about the city except that I lived in it.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:21.480
[Unknown]: And I've always lived in a big city by a lot, other than nine months when I lived in a small

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.480
[Guest]: town in Virginia.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:28.320
[Guest]: I've always lived in a big city, no city that I've been in had less than a few billion people.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:34.320
[Guest]: And so in a way, you're thinking that you're comfortable with all of this.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:40.200
[Guest]: But at the same time, you're constantly reminded that this isn't the way you would go about

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.920
[Guest]: doing things in the city, or that you're not happy with many of the outcomes that you see

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:45.920
[Guest]: around you.

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:51.560
[Guest]: And so you can start with simply no more than that as the motivation to get involved.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:57.280
[Guest]: And for a lot of people today, I think just making things better, whatever they mean by

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:02.800
[Guest]: that phrase, making things better, not in a Trumpian way of let's make America great

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:06.080
[Guest]: again, but really, actually make things better.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:14.800
[Guest]: A lot of people just get into public issues, primarily with that level of motivation for

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.160
[Guest]: what they want to do.

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:24.960
[Guest]: If we can create a way in which that can be persistent, and metric for continuous improvement,

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.800
[Guest]: I think you would get a very large number of problem solving people from that you could

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:29.800
[Guest]: do lots and lots of things.

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:34.800
[Guest]: I actually think that if you did that, even governments would be responsive to that.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:41.080
[Guest]: I know I've worked closely with lots of people in government, both politicians and administrators.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:46.960
[Guest]: There is a genuine understanding, but they don't have enough allies for the things that

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.880
[Guest]: you and I expect them to do.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:54.720
[Guest]: And so if you were to walk into a government department and offer to work with them to

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:59.680
[Guest]: help do their jobs better, a very large number of people would welcome that.

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:04.080
[Guest]: But if you walk into those same government departments and said, why the hell aren't

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:10.960
[Guest]: you doing your job better, there is a reflexive defensiveness to that.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.880
[Guest]: So in a way, you need to be able to do both.

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.840
[Guest]: You need to be able to go and say, these things aren't good enough.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.040
[Guest]: I expect them to be better, but I will also help you make them better.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:26.920
[Guest]: I think if more of us can come to this balance, while on the one hand, expecting governments

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:32.400
[Guest]: to do better, but on the other hand, accepting that we also have something to contribute

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:39.360
[Guest]: to make that happen, I actually think that within 10 days, everyone in the city could

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:43.920
[Guest]: see themselves becoming a stronger part of the life of their own neighborhood, at least,

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.640
[Guest]: and start to make things better.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.640
[Guest]: It's very easy.

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:51.440
[Guest]: It's like what I said earlier in the last conversation, how do you meet strangers?

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.440
[Guest]: Just go out on the street.

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:57.080
[Guest]: There are lots of strangers, walk up to one of them and say, hi, it sounds like a really

00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:02.520
[Guest]: bizarre thing to do, but it actually does get you to meet strangers if you did that.

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:07.160
[Guest]: So in a way, you have to be sort of goal oriented in a lot of this stuff.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:10.840
[Amit Varma]: If any of my listeners want to go out on the street right now and meet strangers, kindly

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:15.160
[Amit Varma]: wear a mask at least, you know, I want to dive into the weeds of what you're speaking

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:18.800
[Amit Varma]: about in terms of urban governance and citizen participation in that.

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:23.760
[Amit Varma]: But before that, I also want to ask you some broad questions about your philosophy towards

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.800
[Amit Varma]: this whole question of governance in general.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.820
[Amit Varma]: But before even that, we'll take a break.

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:32.800
[Amit Varma]: But before we go into the break, I also want to, you know, throw up a bunch of thoughts

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.800
[Amit Varma]: that I had when you were speaking about education, which is a subject that, you know, one day

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.360
[Amit Varma]: perhaps in a future episode, when we both thought more about it, I'd like to discuss

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.360
[Amit Varma]: at length.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:47.080
[Amit Varma]: First, at an immediate level, we are recording this on October 30th, and I am actually launching

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.640
[Amit Varma]: an online podcasting course later today.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:53.560
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, by the time this episode comes out, hopefully many people will have signed

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.560
[Amit Varma]: up.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:59.800
[Amit Varma]: I also do, of course, run an online writing class, which has had more than 600 students

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.720
[Amit Varma]: since April, since I started it.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.920
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, it's interesting, a few years back, that question which you raised, who

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:08.040
[Amit Varma]: should teach?

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.620
[Amit Varma]: Who should they teach to?

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:14.960
[Amit Varma]: And also a meta question that comes above that is who should answer these two questions?

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:20.160
[Amit Varma]: And I had a broad sort of startup idea many years ago, which aimed to sort of address

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:24.880
[Amit Varma]: this, which was to kind of build a platform where anybody could teach anything to anyone

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.000
[Amit Varma]: and price it at whatever.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.600
[Amit Varma]: And so if a paanwala wanted to teach a five minute thing in Hindi, ki aise shuru karte

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:35.160
[Amit Varma]: hai, this is how you handle the government, this is a stock you need, fine.

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:39.880
[Amit Varma]: Let everybody try whatever they want at whatever price and then let buyers and sellers discover

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.040
[Amit Varma]: each other.

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:47.360
[Amit Varma]: And thank goodness I never did that because no entrepreneurial thing I do ever works out.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.400
[Amit Varma]: And part of where that that impetus came from was I remember looking at the homogeneity

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.880
[Amit Varma]: of what we are offered in our education, like you pointed out that it makes absolutely no

00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:01.720
[Amit Varma]: sense that if you are a certain age, you are studying in a certain standard, and you're

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.320
[Amit Varma]: stuck into that kind of rut.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:08.200
[Amit Varma]: I remember writing a column about I think 11 or 12 years ago about how, you know, after

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:15.360
[Amit Varma]: I saw tare zameen par, how if you go out to a supermarket today, I can find 50 varieties

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:20.240
[Amit Varma]: of shampoo, 40 flavors of potato chips, you know, I'll eventually find something which

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:26.480
[Amit Varma]: suits exactly me, the shampoo that is just right for my, you know, dry keto hair or whatever

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.640
[Amit Varma]: it is to that specification.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:34.080
[Amit Varma]: But in education, sadly, we are all, you know, made to consume sort of the same thing.

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:37.960
[Amit Varma]: So this is, I think, something that we take for granted, it is normal, we don't think

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:38.960
[Amit Varma]: about it.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, your thoughts were pretty sort of stimulating to me.

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.600
[Amit Varma]: And I'd like, you know, maybe our listeners to also think about why we take it for granted.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:51.240
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, obviously, we see a lot of these online platforms up, but I see this

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:57.000
[Amit Varma]: India platforms like by Jews and whatever, and they are essentially just, you know, providing

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.400
[Amit Varma]: the same format of education, and helping you navigate the same system, only the delivery

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.160
[Amit Varma]: mechanism is online instead of life.

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:10.400
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not sure that that's, you know, very far reaching or goes far enough, I think there

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:16.960
[Amit Varma]: is a space for young entrepreneurs to recognize that there is just a big hole in the market

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:21.360
[Amit Varma]: in a much broader sense, and most people realize, and maybe do something about solving these

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.440
[Amit Varma]: big problems.

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.960
[Amit Varma]: And finally, before we go into the break, you know, Lant Pritchett, who you referred

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:30.320
[Amit Varma]: to wrote, you know, one of my favorite papers of the century, called India's flailing state

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:34.840
[Amit Varma]: and something, something, something, but that's where I, you know, first heard the term, India's

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:35.840
[Amit Varma]: flailing state.

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.400
[Amit Varma]: And I linked that from the show notes.

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:43.400
[Amit Varma]: And no doubt his insights are also, you know, have informed a lot of my thinking about India,

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.400
[Amit Varma]: certainly.

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.960
[Amit Varma]: So let's come back and get into the weeds and deeper into this interesting Chinese box.

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.960
[Amit Varma]: I don't even know if I should call it a Chinese box.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:57.640
[Amit Varma]: Could I get into trouble deeper into this new box with many layers after a brief commercial

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.760
[Amit Varma]: break?

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:04.360
[Amit Varma]: On the scene and the unseen, I often speak about positive sum games.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:09.320
[Amit Varma]: Well, if you want to be surrounded by beauty, and you love fine art, I have a win win proposition

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:15.720
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:20.560
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Ashwin Mahesh about urban governance ostensibly, but as tends to happen

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:24.360
[Amit Varma]: in my show, when I'm talking to interesting people who think deeply about many things,

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:28.280
[Amit Varma]: we've gone into different directions, one of which of course was, you know, education

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:29.800
[Amit Varma]: itself.

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:34.760
[Amit Varma]: And Ashwin, when we were in the break, you said you wanted to respond to what I had just

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.880
[Amit Varma]: said before the break.

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:36.880
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, go ahead.

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:43.320
[Guest]: You know, Tim Marshall wrote an interesting book called Prisoners of Geography about how

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:55.680
[Guest]: a lot of a nation's choices are constrained by geography, terrain in particular, and productivity

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:58.040
[Guest]: of land, things like that.

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:02.920
[Guest]: But you know, you could extend that sort of thinking to a lot of other things too, that

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:08.320
[Guest]: I think even in a city, we are prisoners of our geography, the neighborhoods.

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:13.960
[Guest]: So we tend to think of a lot of things as the accidental circumstance of birth in certain

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:18.240
[Guest]: families, in certain places and so on and so forth.

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:26.720
[Guest]: But it continues through the rest of one's life as well, that there is a sort of prisonership

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.560
[Guest]: to geography in a lot of things.

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.600
[Guest]: You live in a nice neighborhood, you have a set of opportunities that come from merely

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.960
[Guest]: living in a nice neighborhood.

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.480
[Guest]: In places like America, this has been taken to an extreme.

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:42.160
[Guest]: You live in a nice neighborhood, property taxes fund local education, public education

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.160
[Guest]: in a powerful way.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:47.000
[Guest]: You live in a poor neighborhood, you don't even have the money to teach your kids properly.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:58.400
[Guest]: And so you have these sorts of traps into which we have let ourselves into.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:04.360
[Guest]: And a lot of the planning and the administration and implementation of plans and schemes is

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:10.720
[Guest]: not systematic enough about equity in outcomes.

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:13.120
[Guest]: We actually have a lot of attention to economy.

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:19.480
[Guest]: We have a lot of some attention to ecology, increasingly of it, but we don't really have

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:21.560
[Guest]: much attention to equity.

00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:24.880
[Guest]: There's a lot of lip service to equity.

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:30.880
[Guest]: There's a lot of talk about what should be and what should not be, but you wouldn't find

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:39.280
[Guest]: a push for equity in actual budgets of governments or actual stances and policies.

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:44.520
[Guest]: So in a way, often governments even make the mistake of saying that we speak on behalf

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:52.640
[Guest]: of the poor, but it's not clear by what achievement they lay claim to that.

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:58.080
[Guest]: You can say that governments have a legitimacy to speak on behalf of the poor, but it's not

00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.080
[Guest]: clear.

00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:02.480
[Guest]: I mean, they have a very large public school system or a public health system, which is

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:08.880
[Guest]: quite abysmal in some way, and probably underserves the poor more than it underserves anybody

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:14.880
[Guest]: else because the poor are often turning to those systems, and yet governments have given

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:20.560
[Guest]: themselves the legitimacy to speak for the poor after having let them down massively

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:25.600
[Guest]: in their own direct lines of opportunity to serve.

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:33.120
[Guest]: So in a way, I think there's a lot of us who are just caught in our situations and being

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:40.160
[Guest]: deliberate about overcoming that prisonership is important to solve any problem because

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:47.520
[Guest]: you are inheriting a lot of things, you're inheriting a past, partly a colonial past

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:52.200
[Guest]: and then administrative infrastructure that didn't change very much when you inherited

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:59.360
[Guest]: that past and imbalance between state market and society in which it was common during

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.360
[Guest]: colonial times.

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:06.840
[Guest]: This happened a lot, the instruments of the state, what is particularly designed to favor

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:09.400
[Guest]: certain market outcomes.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:14.000
[Guest]: So if you inherit that, you're going to get exactly that kind of state even today.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.520
[Guest]: And this is, you can call it what you like, you can call it crony capitalism, you can

00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:24.800
[Guest]: call it just a weak state hostage to particular private interests, you can call it all these

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.800
[Guest]: things.

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:30.320
[Unknown]: But in many ways, it's just a continuity of something that existed 100 years ago, a

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:33.360
[Guest]: bout which we have not thought deeply enough.

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:38.760
[Guest]: You asked me earlier, what was my sort of starting point for a lot of these things?

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:47.560
[Guest]: I actually think from first principles, I think people have a right to be free.

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:53.000
[Guest]: That this right is not something that the state gives you or me, that we have this right,

00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:01.240
[Guest]: that the mere truth of being born has endowed us with that right, and that governments of

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:08.560
[Guest]: any persuasion should not have the right to take that away from us.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:14.840
[Guest]: And also that this term being free has to mean more than physically free, the freedom

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:22.120
[Guest]: to think and to act in ways that are consistent with what you think, I mean, of course, subject

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:27.360
[Guest]: to not harming others and all those kinds of caveats, but broadly, that it should actually

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:33.600
[Guest]: be possible for liberty and freedom to anchor a democratic society.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:39.840
[Guest]: And we shouldn't really have to convince ourselves of that again and again.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:45.320
[Guest]: I think what has happened in the last five years, not just in India, but even globally,

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:51.240
[Guest]: is that an increasing number of people, even in democratic societies, have sort of given

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.240
[Guest]: up on this foundation in some way.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:01:01.080
[Guest]: You look at what happens in places like Hungary or Poland nowadays, for example, and you wonder,

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:07.080
[Guest]: these are people who have suffered for decades under authoritarian rule, and they seem willing

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:14.240
[Guest]: to flirt with it again today, just two decades after getting out of, you know, Soviet control

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.240
[Guest]: in some way.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.840
[Guest]: And what it tells you is that public memory is short about a lot of these things, but

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:26.320
[Guest]: it also tells you that the responses from people are very situational.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:32.680
[Guest]: They're simply saying yes and no to the set of questions that are put before them.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:39.520
[Guest]: And it's like, often the answers are like having a diet for the left side of your body.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.920
[Guest]: You can have a diet for the upper body strength, you can have a diet for lower body strength,

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.960
[Unknown]: but you can't have a diet for the left side of your body.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.720
[Guest]: That doesn't make any sense.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:53.920
[Guest]: Too much of the choices that are presented to us in the political arena are really diets

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.080
[Guest]: for the one side of our body, and it just is never going to add up.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:04.800
[Guest]: That constantly reminding ourselves what the foundation for participation in public life,

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:09.520
[Guest]: for foundation for participating in governance is, that's important.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.160
[Guest]: And I think if we did that, we would be more fair to the people around us too.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:22.480
[Guest]: The idea that a young child begging on the street has a right to liberty, has a right

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:27.560
[Guest]: to a kind of freedom and opportunity.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:35.720
[Guest]: I think that is, it's a basic decency that I think all of us are capable of mastering.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:43.360
[Guest]: But somewhere along that journey, we have allowed this to deteriorate or just recede

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:50.480
[Guest]: even into a mere administrative problem, or even a traffic problem.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:56.920
[Guest]: You find it an annoyance that at a traffic light, you are, quote unquote, disturbed by

01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.040
[Guest]: such things, or that there's a risk of accidents from such things.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:07.480
[Guest]: It's kind of bizarre that such suffering is, it doesn't motivate us to go back to first

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.120
[Guest]: principles on a lot of things.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:16.880
[Guest]: And we live, I said this earlier too, we live in India today among the largest concentrations

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.680
[Guest]: of poor people in the history of the planet.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:26.560
[Guest]: You could say it's partly the result of our sheer numbers and all of that stuff, but the

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:30.960
[Guest]: numbers are the result of underdevelopment too, in some way, and the lack of women's

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.440
[Guest]: empowerment in particular.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:37.520
[Guest]: I think in some ways we have to acknowledge where we are and start from that.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:43.360
[Guest]: And you have to start from the sense that people have rights, and those rights are not

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.440
[Guest]: necessarily the ones that the state has given to them, that some rights they have.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:51.600
[Guest]: You can believe that these are God-given rights, if you were a God-fearing person.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:58.800
[Guest]: You believe that these are social organization rights that are good to have in a democracy.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.920
[Guest]: It doesn't matter what you think is the foundation for such rights.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:08.240
[Guest]: It's important to believe that you have those rights, and that not just you, but your friends

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:13.600
[Guest]: and your partners and your relatives and your neighbors, they have those rights too.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:21.680
[Guest]: But I think too often we explain away non-adherence to those rights as necessary responses to

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.240
[Guest]: this problem or that problem.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:32.840
[Guest]: But I actually think that if we were to more feverishly support people's rights, you'd

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:37.200
[Guest]: actually get many of the development outcomes for which we claim to be suppressing those

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.200
[Unknown]: rights.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:45.720
[Guest]: It's really sad, but fundamentally you can do a lot better by arguments around liberty

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.840
[Guest]: than you can through arguments of efficiency.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:49.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:55.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, that's one of my bugbears that we tend to behave as if, I mean, the way I look

01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.120
[Amit Varma]: at the state is again, the Lockean view that the state is there to protect our rights and

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.720
[Amit Varma]: our rights precede the state.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:06.200
[Amit Varma]: The state is an instrument for the protection of our rights and blah, blah, blah.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.560
[Amit Varma]: And instead, how we look at it is we behave as if the state is a maibap and these rights

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:15.720
[Amit Varma]: are given to us by the state, and therefore they are contingent on circumstances and our

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.360
[Amit Varma]: behavior and blah, blah, blah.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.680
[Amit Varma]: And it just all goes out of bag.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.920
[Amit Varma]: This is a sort of a fundamental issue there.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.200
[Guest]: It was a simple way to sort of keep reminding yourself of that.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:31.880
[Guest]: The Republic of India, or whatever, India as an independent country existed before there

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.400
[Guest]: was a government of independent India.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.120
[Guest]: So there must obviously have been a time when you had all these rights with or without the

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:44.160
[Guest]: government, but it's quite logical to think that people have rights before the state even

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.160
[Guest]: is born.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:52.280
[Guest]: And in fact, the state is a construction by the people of such a way of working together.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:57.720
[Guest]: But one of the things, if you see the presentation that I sent you, it talks about three ways

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.720
[Guest]: of re-imagining life.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:05.760
[Guest]: And one of the first things that I say is think like it's 1947.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:11.080
[Guest]: What I mean by that is that we far too often, we think that the things that have been given

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:17.760
[Guest]: to us at the founding of the nation are substantially immutable.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:24.520
[Guest]: So in a way, but that's not true at all, that the constitution has had more than 100 amendments.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:31.800
[Guest]: So in a way, we've got to recognize that every generation has both a right and an obligation

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:39.720
[Guest]: to imagine the way in which it wants to organize itself, both for its own current welfare and

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.520
[Guest]: in fairness to future generations.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:48.560
[Guest]: And therefore, re-imagining the law, re-imagining the constitution, re-imagining even social

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:52.480
[Guest]: organization is both a right and a responsibility.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:58.440
[Guest]: And unfortunately, we've completely dropped the ball on that and really almost the entirety

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:05.960
[Guest]: of our problem with urbanization today is because of this, that we still live in a country

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:11.080
[Guest]: whose framework for governance is largely rural.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:19.520
[Guest]: But increasingly the lives of the people are urban and the political and administrative

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:25.760
[Guest]: system are 30 to 40 years behind the reality in catching up to this.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:33.320
[Guest]: So I mean, I think a very simple thing that our delimitation of constituencies, our delimitation

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:38.960
[Guest]: of constituencies at one level is from 1971, the interstate division of seats in parliament

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:47.240
[Guest]: is from 1971, the intrastate delimitation of constituencies is from 2001, 20 years ago.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:53.480
[Guest]: In 20 years, at least 15 more percent has been added to the organization of the country,

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:58.560
[Guest]: but that isn't reflected in your state legislatures in any part of the country, except in Delhi,

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.240
[Guest]: which is almost entirely urban.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:07.960
[Guest]: So if you go to a typical large state, what you have is very disproportionate participation

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:16.520
[Guest]: in legislatures by people from rural areas and deep under-representation of urban citizens

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.520
[Guest]: in some way.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:24.720
[Guest]: And I think this is really the core of the problem with urbanization.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:31.320
[Guest]: We look at areas with very high density of living in very urban areas outside Bangalore

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:36.240
[Guest]: or Chennai or Kolkata, and we call them rural areas.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:42.320
[Guest]: I mean, if 10,000 people live in 20 acres of land, there's just no way in the world

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:45.160
[Guest]: you can call that a rural area.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:50.640
[Guest]: But because it says in the law that this is a rural area, and nobody's actually taken

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:56.040
[Guest]: the step to convert that from a rural area to an urban area, and there's a good political

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.040
[Guest]: reason for that.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:02.800
[Guest]: The flow of money into the political system is more decentralized in rural areas than

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.800
[Guest]: it is in urban areas.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:09.920
[Guest]: Therefore, if you are a politician in a panchayat, you would fight like hell to make sure that

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:13.600
[Guest]: it does not get converted into a town council.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:19.480
[Guest]: Because your ability to influence things in the urban governance system is a lot weaker

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:24.840
[Guest]: than your ability to influence things, for good or bad, in the rural governance system.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:30.040
[Unknown]: So you have very large, there are villages outside Bangalore, 25,000 people.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:37.160
[Guest]: There's no way that's a village, but nobody wants to say this is not a village anymore.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:43.480
[Amit Varma]: So before we get into the weeds and get into detail about all of these things, sort of

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.600
[Amit Varma]: a couple of larger questions, and the first of them fits very nicely into the frame of

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.480
[Amit Varma]: Imaginist 1947.

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:53.640
[Amit Varma]: Now you were talking about how we take these sort of these structures of government for

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:58.920
[Amit Varma]: granted that we've inherited the past, and from that we've inherited these colonial structures

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.200
[Amit Varma]: and this colonial system of government and all of that.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:06.600
[Amit Varma]: But it also strikes me that it's not just, in this case, not just a question of the inertia

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:12.120
[Amit Varma]: of the past, that this is how we've inherited, and so we also inherit certain ways of thinking.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:18.400
[Amit Varma]: What also strikes me is that the way our state and the way our democracy was designed in

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:24.960
[Amit Varma]: 1947, to use your frame of Imaginist 1947, makes such outcomes inevitable.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.320
[Amit Varma]: Because then what happens is, one, you don't have enough local governance, which is a theme

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.880
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure we'll talk about much more as we go along, but two, what you also have is,

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:37.800
[Amit Varma]: you set up this vicious circle between power and money, where it's a democracy, you've

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.240
[Amit Varma]: got to win elections.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, number one, the state has way more power than it should.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.000
[Amit Varma]: That makes it attractive.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, rent seeking is therefore far more aspirational than actually creating value

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.440
[Amit Varma]: in the real world and making money that way.

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.320
[Amit Varma]: So you want to be part of the state.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.620
[Amit Varma]: What that means is that there is a lust for power.

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:59.200
[Amit Varma]: The only way to get to power, the way our democracy is designed, is through spending

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.200
[Amit Varma]: a lot of money.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.320
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, where does the money come from?

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.800
[Amit Varma]: It comes from, again, crony capitalists who will want an ROI, who will want a return on

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.160
[Amit Varma]: investment, which is why, you know, India at various times has been pro-business, but

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:15.100
[Amit Varma]: it has never been pro-markets, because pro-business and pro-markets, as we know, are completely

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:21.200
[Amit Varma]: opposite things that, you know, big money wants to shut down competition so it can continue

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.200
[Amit Varma]: unimpeded.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.560
[Amit Varma]: But that's a different sort of tangent.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:29.320
[Amit Varma]: But so, in a sense, it's not just that we've taken on the baggage of the past, but the

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:35.040
[Amit Varma]: design of the state and the design of our democracy in 1947 sort of makes our current

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:40.600
[Amit Varma]: outcomes A, inevitable and B, almost immutable, because what do you do about this now?

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.680
[Amit Varma]: So what are your sort of responses to this?

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:47.600
[Unknown]: Yeah, so there's a direction and what you're saying is that there's a directionality from

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:52.980
[Guest]: any starting point that inevitably leads only in certain directions.

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:56.280
[Guest]: So I mean, take the question of, here's a little thing you can try.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.280
[Guest]: Ask anybody.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:01.240
[Guest]: Ask 100 people that you know in the next, whatever, 100 days.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:06.840
[Guest]: What percentage of your tax would you like to give to your local council, and what percentage

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:10.320
[Guest]: would you like to give to your state government, and what percentage would you like to give

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.960
[Guest]: to the national government?

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:16.480
[Unknown]: I guarantee you that on average, you'll find people saying that at least 20% of their tax

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.800
[Guest]: money should be given to their local council, but in practice, not even 1 or 2% of people's

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.360
[Guest]: taxes go to their local councils.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:30.760
[Guest]: And this is a kind of an interesting thing, where you have a universal opinion that a

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:38.560
[Guest]: higher percentage of one's taxes should go to a local council, and despite the universal

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:44.240
[Guest]: acceptance of this view, in a democratic society, it is not done.

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.920
[Guest]: I mean, think about that.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:52.280
[Guest]: If the point of democracy, representative democracy, is to take people's preferences

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:58.560
[Guest]: and incorporate them into law and governance, here you have a situation in which the overwhelming

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.520
[Guest]: majority of people want something, and the thing that is done is the very opposite of

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.520
[Guest]: that.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:10.440
[Guest]: So somewhere, it tells you that there's a break in this representativeness of the whole

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:11.440
[Guest]: thing.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.960
[Unknown]: Now, the way to break that is not to convince the guys who are holding on to the money to

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.960
[Unknown]: give up the money.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.960
[Guest]: They're not going to do it.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.280
[Guest]: The way to do that, in some ways, even though I don't like these kinds of examples, it is

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:28.920
[Guest]: Reagan-esque or Thatcherite in some way, that people with a different imagination of government

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:34.440
[Guest]: itself have to get into government to be able to change this.

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.960
[Unknown]: But there's a huge risk attached to that.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:41.000
[Guest]: Once they get into government, their imaginations of government tend to be a little different

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.480
[Guest]: from what they had before they got into government.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.880
[Guest]: There are enough people asking me what happened to Swaraj.

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:56.960
[Guest]: So I actually sort of, in some ways, recognize that there is a trap in this, but I also don't

01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:03.320
[Guest]: see any other way forward, that ultimately, if we're going to get out of this directionality

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.680
[Guest]: that comes from initially having only a state national government, then having state governments,

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:14.080
[Guest]: then having some kind of quasi-local government.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.960
[Guest]: And in many states, local councils don't really do much.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.960
[Guest]: In Bangalore, the local council doesn't do much.

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:25.440
[Guest]: A very large number of things here are done by parastatals, like your bus company, and

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.680
[Guest]: the water board, and the electricity board, and things like that.

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.440
[Guest]: And it's a little better in the Western states, Maharashtra and Gujarat.

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:37.560
[Guest]: But even generally around the country, local councils are not very powerful in some way.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.080
[Guest]: And then, of course, you don't have the planning bodies at all, in any independent way.

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.520
[Guest]: You don't have the ward councils and the participatory governance at the local level.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:51.800
[Guest]: And these are also things in which I think the courts are partly to blame.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:58.200
[Guest]: The courts are repeatedly acquiesced with punting by the government when asked why they're

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:00.960
[Guest]: not doing the things that they're required to do in law.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:06.360
[Guest]: The government can violate almost any right of the people.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.360
[Guest]: And when it is challenged in the court, they'll give you some explanation.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:13.240
[Guest]: And the most likely response from the court is, okay, we'll have a new hearing in four

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.240
[Guest]: weeks.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:19.560
[Guest]: I mean, generally, the most common thing that courts in India say is, we'll have a new hearing

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.560
[Guest]: in four weeks.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:26.440
[Guest]: And that's really a very sad reality, that especially when the government is a defendant,

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.720
[Guest]: typically, they can go on saying that for years together.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:34.120
[Guest]: I mean, the 74th Amendment was passed in 1992.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.440
[Guest]: Why isn't there a Metapolitan Planning Committee for Bengaluru 28 years later?

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:42.800
[Guest]: It can't be that it takes 28 years to implement the Constitution of India.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.680
[Guest]: But if you go to the High Court of Karnataka and say, why is this not being implemented?

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:50.720
[Guest]: They'll send a notice to the government of Karnataka and the government will send a response

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:55.320
[Guest]: and the court will say, let's have a hearing in four weeks.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:59.440
[Guest]: And after a while, the guys who are asking the questions, tell themselves, I can write

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:03.200
[Guest]: myself this notice myself without going through the sharing.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:11.600
[Guest]: So in a way, the state is not merely more powerful than market and society.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:17.760
[Guest]: The state, using the resources of market and society, has made itself more resilient to

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.160
[Guest]: the status quo as well.

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.520
[Guest]: And that's really the problem.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:27.440
[Guest]: It's only when you get catastrophic things like a pandemic, that all of this stands set

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.080
[Guest]: up like the emperor's new clothes in some way.

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.080
[Guest]: So in a way, today, you can see the nakedness of the whole thing.

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:40.280
[Guest]: But in quote unquote, normal times, it seems like there's a way to punt everything to the

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.280
[Guest]: next question.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:45.880
[Guest]: And that's really the problem that you're not going to get solutions if you keep punting

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.880
[Amit Varma]: the question.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:47.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.080
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, speaking about the pandemic sort of opening our eyes, a few months back, just

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.800
[Amit Varma]: as the sort of lockdowns had begun, I wrote a column about how one of the things that

01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:01.400
[Amit Varma]: has done is it's kind of made more visceral what we otherwise normalized and took for

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:05.760
[Amit Varma]: granted, which is that, you know, the big disaster here is not just a pandemic, but

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.800
[Amit Varma]: there is also the disaster of the flailing state, as it were, I think I quoted Richard

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.840
[Amit Varma]: in that column, that, you know, we can speak about the harm that COVID-19 is doing.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:18.520
[Amit Varma]: But 3000 children die in India of starvation every day.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:22.040
[Amit Varma]: And in what way is that also not a disaster that we must tackle?

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:27.920
[Amit Varma]: And in what way is that also not a sort of a manmade disaster, as it were, and largely

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:28.920
[Amit Varma]: manmade.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:33.000
[Amit Varma]: So I, you know, don't feel bad using that gender specific term.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.200
[Amit Varma]: So I had a question for you, which I was actually saving for later, but you brought it up.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.060
[Amit Varma]: So I'll kind of ask it now, which is like, first of all, you spoke about people might

01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:46.160
[Amit Varma]: go into government for Reagan-esque and Thatcher-esque reasons.

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And I think you almost used those terms in half embarrassment, but I don't think they're

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.320
[Amit Varma]: bad words at all.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:57.400
[Amit Varma]: But question here is that, you know, you've also spoken a lot in our last episode and

01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:03.520
[Amit Varma]: otherwise and even later today, I'm sure about how citizens must get involved in the task

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.520
[Amit Varma]: of governance.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:05.520
[Amit Varma]: You cannot leave it to the state.

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.200
[Amit Varma]: There is a role for citizens.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:11.600
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you know, there's a mandated space for it, which is made in our constitution,

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.280
[Amit Varma]: as you pointed out at the start of the episode.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:20.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, my question here is that, to what extent must a citizen become a political animal?

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:25.280
[Amit Varma]: Because I see that then there is an added danger in getting entangled in the political

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:30.680
[Amit Varma]: process and that then changing, you know, what the citizen got in there for the first

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:31.680
[Amit Varma]: place.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:37.200
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, we've all heard the old saw of power corrupts, but politics also corrodes

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.360
[Amit Varma]: character, you know, and we spoke a lot about like the Aam Aadmi Party, which you're a part

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.200
[Amit Varma]: of and what has happened to them in Delhi in our last episode, but leave that aside

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.360
[Amit Varma]: at a general philosophical level.

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:52.480
[Amit Varma]: Does it then become a problem that as citizens, perhaps for good reasons, or perhaps those

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:57.280
[Amit Varma]: good reasons are the rationalization for other instincts, but as citizens get more and more

01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:03.200
[Amit Varma]: involved in government, is it a danger that their incentives changing along the way also

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.440
[Amit Varma]: changes their behavior and what they got in for?

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:11.200
[Guest]: Of course, there's the danger, but it's, I mean, let's take an analogous thing.

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:18.880
[Guest]: Let's say you're reading philosophy, you know, you read all sorts of philosophers and often

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:26.640
[Guest]: with very, you could read Kant and you could read Milton and you could read, whatever.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:36.000
[Guest]: There are big differences between philosophical positions and you don't think by and large

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:42.600
[Guest]: that reading about all of them could prejudice you towards one of the wrong choices.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:49.240
[Guest]: You accept that reading about all of them is part of an education about whatever stance

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:52.200
[Guest]: you eventually come to.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:57.680
[Guest]: You don't decide beforehand that you're going to be utilitarian simply because you've read

01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.680
[Guest]: Milton.

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:04.840
[Guest]: You're reading about utilitarianism to understand utilitarianism, you might read about something

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.800
[Guest]: else to understand that.

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:15.360
[Guest]: I think public life is like that, that yes, it comes with the entanglement that you referred

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:18.960
[Guest]: to, but the entanglement is part of the education.

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:27.400
[Guest]: The entanglement is not part of the stance that you necessarily need to come to.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:32.320
[Guest]: I actually think it's much easier for me to work with people if I understand their different

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:37.120
[Guest]: motivations for engaging the same problems that I engage with, with whatever motivation

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.120
[Guest]: I have.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:45.000
[Guest]: One of the best conversations I've ever had on watershed development in Karnataka was

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.880
[Guest]: with Basaraj Bommai, who was Water Resources Minister in the BJP government.

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:53.280
[Guest]: He really knows his stuff, right?

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:58.360
[Guest]: It may be that his political persuasion is very different from mine, but you know, we're

01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:01.560
[Guest]: talking about water resources development and watershed management.

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:08.520
[Guest]: A, you should be able to have that conversation independent of things like that, and second,

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:14.720
[Guest]: you should be able to say that even if our political persuasions are different, that's

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:18.000
[Guest]: not a reason not to have this conversation.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.960
[Guest]: I think Elkia Dhawani said this in, I'm going to say 10 years ago almost, he and Atalji

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:37.120
[Guest]: were far closer to the other side of the political spectrum than today's political persons are

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.120
[Guest]: to other persuasions.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:44.920
[Guest]: They do know each other, but somehow I think we don't really have the continuity of engagement

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:50.640
[Guest]: across the political aisle, which is a necessary part, I mean, that's why you have the assembly,

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.640
[Guest]: right?

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.520
[Guest]: You don't have an assembly only for those who win the elections.

01:21:54.520 --> 01:22:00.600
[Guest]: The assembly is a place for both who are in government and for people in opposition, and

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:06.880
[Guest]: if we did not accept that there is a health to the process of being opposed and persuaded

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:10.520
[Guest]: by others, you wouldn't have the assemblies be the way they are, right?

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:17.360
[Guest]: So I think the constitution is quite clear that contestation is part of the health of

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.360
[Guest]: a democracy.

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:23.320
[Guest]: So I don't think we should worry about that, and with all contestation comes the risk that

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:27.880
[Guest]: you become attached to the winning side, or you would at least like your side of that

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.480
[Guest]: contest to win.

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:34.040
[Guest]: I think that's normal, and it's not something to be afraid of, and I think what disciplines

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:38.360
[Guest]: this is not your victory, but the certainty that after your victory there would be somebody

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:39.940
[Guest]: to contest it.

01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:46.320
[Guest]: So in a way, I wouldn't feel too smug about winning this battle or that.

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:51.160
[Guest]: It is a permanent battle, and it's something you have to engage with again and again.

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:55.440
[Guest]: Being on the sidelines more or less ensures that you're never going to be on the winning

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.440
[Guest]: side.

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:59.480
[Guest]: I think it's better for people to want to be on the winning side for a few years at

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:05.000
[Guest]: a time at least, and in other years to be part of the side that brings health to the

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
[Guest]: overall thing.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:12.520
[Guest]: I think that's a much better stance to take, but the thing I've seen that dissuades people

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:17.520
[Guest]: more is that they believe they have to do a lot to be useful in public life.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:24.280
[Guest]: People think, you know, I'm a working professional, or I have a day job, or whatever.

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:30.560
[Guest]: I have other commitments that I'm supposed to meet, and at the end of meeting all of

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:36.120
[Guest]: those commitments, I have neither the bandwidth nor the mental energy to engage in public

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.120
[Guest]: issues.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:42.880
[Guest]: The sad part is that a very large part of the things that you are trying to sort of

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:48.960
[Guest]: take care of in private life are being done in private life only because the public systems

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.440
[Guest]: are not good enough to take care of them.

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:56.960
[Guest]: If you really had a well-funded and well-run public education system, you probably wouldn't

01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:00.040
[Guest]: need as much money to send your child to a private school.

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:08.280
[Guest]: So in a way, there is a tighter link between what we think of as a public problem and our

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:14.200
[Guest]: private life than we actually recognize, that, you know, if your scooter goes over a pothole

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:19.640
[Guest]: and you tip over and have an accident, and you're out of action for six weeks, that really

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:23.720
[Guest]: is a public problem that has become a private problem.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:30.720
[Guest]: So you can tell yourself that you didn't have the bandwidth to insist on better roads, but

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:34.640
[Guest]: six weeks in a hospital is a lot of bandwidth that you didn't want to have either.

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:40.400
[Guest]: So in a way, I think these problems are not so distant from each other as people tell

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.040
[Guest]: themselves they are.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:50.240
[Guest]: I think public and private problems overlap a lot, and by addressing public problems more

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:55.920
[Guest]: energetically, we would actually give ourselves more latitude in private life too.

01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:03.520
[Guest]: So there's a schizophrenia about this too, which is that people who say they don't have

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:08.520
[Guest]: the bandwidth for this, they often feel quite empowered about their private lives, that

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:12.160
[Guest]: they are achieving this or that in their job, they're buying a house, they're buying a car,

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:19.360
[Guest]: they're moving up the promotion ranks in their companies, and yet they sort of tell themselves

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:24.520
[Guest]: that they don't really have much to contribute to public life, which is kind of schizophrenic

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:28.800
[Guest]: in some sense, that they're not even telling you that they won't do it, they're actually

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.840
[Guest]: telling you that they can't do it.

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:36.200
[Guest]: This word can't is something that they eschew in private life, but it comes out quite readily

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.200
[Guest]: in public life.

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:42.400
[Amit Varma]: In fact, from what you're saying, it's a fairly profound point, and it leads me to think that

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:48.480
[Amit Varma]: perhaps the apathy of the people comes from the apathetic state, and we don't often see

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:53.420
[Amit Varma]: this link that the public problem, the pothole over which our scooter trips and we spend

01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:57.640
[Amit Varma]: six weeks in hospital, that it's something that our participation could help.

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:02.960
[Amit Varma]: And I'll dig a little deeper into that apathy as we kind of get into it.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:09.120
[Amit Varma]: My one final big question before we kind of get into the weeds is I was very curious about

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:14.280
[Amit Varma]: the philosophical approach to urban planning in a sense that one of the finest biographies

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:18.920
[Amit Varma]: I've read, which I'm sure you must have read as well as the Power Broker by Robert Caro,

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:24.320
[Amit Varma]: which was a biography of Robert Moses, a man who planned and built much of New York as

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:28.920
[Amit Varma]: it were, and for much of his career, Moses was in opposition with Jane Jacobs.

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:33.800
[Amit Varma]: And if I can briefly and perhaps to simply sum up what those opposing schools of thought

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:38.440
[Amit Varma]: were, Moses was all about, okay, we should have a master plan for the city and flyover

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.360
[Amit Varma]: should be here and this is how it should go.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.960
[Amit Varma]: And you plan that from the top down, though at a city level, but from the top down and

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.320
[Amit Varma]: you execute it.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:52.880
[Amit Varma]: And Jacobs's whole point was that look, cities evolve organically, and anything you do coercively

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:57.840
[Amit Varma]: to force a particular vision on how a city is growing will harm the city and will harm

01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:58.840
[Amit Varma]: its inhabitants.

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:05.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, I don't necessarily, you know, see a contradiction here when you talk about, you

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:12.240
[Amit Varma]: know, planning at a local level, because it does seem to me that, you know, that in this

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:16.920
[Amit Varma]: trade off of how much you want to plan from the top down and how much you want to, how

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:20.720
[Amit Varma]: much the citizen should be empowered at the local level to have a voice on how the city

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:21.960
[Amit Varma]: is actually growing.

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:29.080
[Amit Varma]: I think there is probably a sweet meeting point somewhere where these two come together

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.240
[Amit Varma]: and citizens remain empowered.

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:35.240
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, you can get some planning done.

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.720
[Amit Varma]: Is there that sweet point?

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:42.520
[Amit Varma]: What is your thinking on sort of this being these sort of different ways of thinking about

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:43.520
[Amit Varma]: the problem?

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:48.000
[Amit Varma]: And does that then, you know, at what scale do you have that sweet point?

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.080
[Amit Varma]: And at what scale do you say that, no, top down thinking simply doesn't work here?

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:58.040
[Guest]: Well, here's how I would put it, there is a sweet meeting point, but neither Moses nor

01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.040
[Guest]: Jacobs would believe that.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:07.680
[Guest]: And that's important that the sweet meeting point exists because both of them don't believe

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:08.680
[Guest]: that.

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:16.440
[Guest]: Therefore, we cannot make it the purpose of a Jacobs-Moses conversation to arrive at that

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.200
[Guest]: meeting point.

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:23.840
[Guest]: We actually have to have the confidence that such meeting points arise naturally from the

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.840
[Guest]: stringent positions of a Moses or a Jacobs.

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:29.800
[Guest]: And I think that's important to recognize.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:38.600
[Guest]: And maybe that's part of the difficulty, that fundamentally we're too often trying to ask

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.600
[Guest]: the question, this is a different kind of who problem.

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:46.480
[Guest]: We take a guy who is the mayor of the city, and then you say, okay, how can we make him

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.480
[Guest]: do ABC?

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.760
[Guest]: Completely unmindful of the fact that the forces that have brought him to be the mayor

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.360
[Guest]: of the city have nothing to do with ABC.

01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:06.160
[Guest]: So in a way, I think you have to accept that good median outcomes are quite often the result

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:13.240
[Guest]: of contested positions that are not as close to the median as one might like it to be.

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:22.480
[Guest]: I mean, look at Biden's candidacy, it's kind of odd that in a primary process that is replete

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:28.440
[Guest]: with extremism, both in the Democratic Party and in the Republican Party, you get two very

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.600
[Guest]: different sets of candidates.

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:36.440
[Guest]: In one process, you get a Donald Trump, who is basically farther right than anybody else

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.440
[Guest]: in his party.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:43.440
[Guest]: So in fact, he's being dragged left by his own people, ironically.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:50.960
[Guest]: But then you get Joe Biden, who's probably also farther right than his own primary voters,

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:51.960
[Guest]: at least.

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.840
[Unknown]: And those primary voters are making a different calculation, that if you put up the wrong

01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:58.040
[Guest]: way, if you put up a Sanders, he might not win the actual election.

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.640
[Guest]: He might win the primary, but he might not win the actual election.

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:06.480
[Guest]: So I think the way people think about this is that they understand that their choices

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:14.320
[Guest]: have an immediate stamp of approval for a certain position, but they also understand

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:22.920
[Guest]: that the stamp of approval has to be modulated by many, many such stamps from other people.

01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:31.920
[Guest]: And partly, if we taught democracy better, if we actually taught public problem solving,

01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.960
[Guest]: most kids would know this instinctively.

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:39.800
[Guest]: Most kids would continue to care deeply about something and accept that things can still

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:45.680
[Guest]: be different, because others also care deeply about something else.

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:50.560
[Guest]: But what we have now is a situation in which people care deeply about the thing that they

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:55.240
[Guest]: care about, but they have no exposure and understanding of the things that others care

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:56.240
[Guest]: about.

01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:00.680
[Guest]: And so that actually leads to a kind of polarization that is unnecessary.

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:08.640
[Guest]: Yesterday, I was talking to somebody who was setting up a new public policy school.

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:13.360
[Guest]: And we were talking about, you know, it's all very fine to say I have a graduate program

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:19.360
[Guest]: for 60 students that really teaches them hands-on interventions in government.

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:23.600
[Guest]: But broadly, I think we have to start with the view that governance is too important

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.560
[Guest]: to be left to the government.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:33.160
[Guest]: That in a way, you have to say that ordinary people, children, and young adults, and adults

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:37.320
[Guest]: all have a role to play in governance, that governance actually begins with self-governance.

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:44.120
[Guest]: And if you did not have self-governance, you cannot have even an expectation of governance

01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.120
[Guest]: beyond that.

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:50.960
[Guest]: It is only by doing the thing that you can, that you acquire both the capacity and the

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:55.440
[Guest]: right to go to somebody in public office and say, if I can do these things myself, what

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:58.960
[Guest]: on earth are you doing after being paid to do this?

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:06.880
[Guest]: So in a way, I think the minute you accept that you have a role to play in strengthening

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:13.240
[Guest]: governance as a citizen, it becomes a lot easier to work with a lot of other people

01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.240
[Guest]: for those same outcomes.

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:23.200
[Guest]: And in my experience, I would say that definitely in this city, the people that have actually

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:28.680
[Guest]: worked closely with public officials will all tell you that there is a subset of people

01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:32.880
[Guest]: in public office who want to do the right thing for the right reason.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:38.080
[Guest]: They just don't have enough allies in society to make that happen, that they're actually

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:43.200
[Guest]: hoping that more people from society will stand up and say this should be done and that

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:49.680
[Guest]: should not be done, because such positions would empower them inside their own organizations.

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:53.480
[Unknown]: Because if you look at the nitty-gritty, I used to work in BMTC for the longest time.

01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:58.960
[Guest]: I was a special advisor when we did all those big, thin buses and all of that stuff, and

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:01.960
[Guest]: direction orientation of the bus system.

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:08.080
[Guest]: And there was one set of people in BMTC who instinctively understood and wanted direction

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.080
[Guest]: orientation.

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:13.240
[Guest]: They believed that it would bring greater efficiencies of performance, and that with

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:17.960
[Guest]: fewer buses, you would actually serve more people in certain routes if you deployed them

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:18.960
[Guest]: correctly.

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:24.240
[Guest]: But there was another set of people that just didn't believe that and were hostile to it.

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:28.320
[Guest]: Some of them didn't believe that because they didn't get the mathematics of it, but some

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:33.480
[Guest]: of them didn't believe that because they were reluctant to simply concede that someone in

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:38.700
[Guest]: a junior position could have an idea that's better than someone in a senior position.

01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:44.680
[Guest]: So you have to work with that dynamic and take people along in a situation like that.

01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:49.200
[Guest]: I remember once there was a DTO, I don't know what exactly it stands for, I'm going to say

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.800
[Guest]: Deputy Transport Officer or something like that, Transportation Officer, something like

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:58.960
[Guest]: that, who once told me that the thing that we really appreciated during the years we

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:04.560
[Guest]: did all that is that people from outside of BMTC, outside of government even, were willing

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:09.440
[Guest]: to come into this office and work with us to make things better.

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:14.000
[Guest]: And I've seen that in department after department, even with minister after minister, right?

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:20.280
[Guest]: I mean, many ministers, I remember an event last December that the Deputy Chief Minister

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:25.800
[Guest]: had organized on Atalji's birthday, I think they celebrated in the party as Good Governance

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:26.800
[Guest]: Day.

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:31.840
[Guest]: It is also Christmas Day, but they sort of celebrated as Good Governance Day.

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:38.080
[Guest]: And there was a collection of, you know, departmental heads from different civic agencies that was

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:43.400
[Guest]: called to an event, I'm going to say one of the larger auditoriums in the city, I forget

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:50.840
[Guest]: which one, and they were sort of literally just going through, and a few of us were moderators

01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:56.400
[Guest]: of the different sessions of the event, and I happened to be the moderator on the session

01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:01.000
[Guest]: on utilities, perhaps with water and power and things like that.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.760
[Guest]: And every department, typically, if you go to a department and ask what it's doing, they

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:11.040
[Guest]: will make you a very nice presentation of all the inputs that they are providing, and

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:17.000
[Guest]: with not nearly as much to show for all the outcomes that you were expecting.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.680
[Guest]: And so you have to cut off that conversation very early.

01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:25.080
[Guest]: And you have to say, look, I have a very simple question, why are you not supplying water

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:26.080
[Guest]: to my house?

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.080
[Guest]: That's the question, right?

01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:30.120
[Guest]: Why are you not supplying water to half the people in the city?

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:32.280
[Guest]: What do you care about my house, right?

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:33.800
[Guest]: You have to start with that.

01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:38.800
[Guest]: And the answer to that question cannot be that BWSSB was established several decades

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:43.320
[Guest]: ago and started laying pipelines at a certain pace with a certain budget, and all of that's

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.320
[Guest]: all BS in some way.

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:45.320
[Guest]: Of course, it's true, but it's still BS.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:54.640
[Guest]: And the reason it's BS is there's a rowdy shooter down the street who runs a mafiosi

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:57.960
[Guest]: tanker who's able to deliver water to my house.

01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:08.160
[Guest]: I mean, a guy who is completely not empowered at all by any state apparatus or state machinery

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:14.360
[Guest]: is able to do the thing that a fully empowered board for the supply of water is unable to

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.360
[Guest]: do.

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:16.360
[Guest]: Right?

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:20.520
[Guest]: That's a pretty big indictment of the system.

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.400
[Guest]: Forget about what your difficulties are.

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:28.920
[Guest]: You are saying that with all the power and resources of a state, you are unable to do

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:35.800
[Guest]: the thing that some random guy is able to do literally on the side, outside of the law

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:36.800
[Guest]: even.

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:37.800
[Guest]: So why is that?

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:47.880
[Guest]: And I think by asking that question first, you can take away the needless deflection

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:52.920
[Guest]: that comes from saying, here's how our pipeline program is going and here's how our budgets

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.880
[Guest]: are for this year and so on and so forth.

01:36:54.880 --> 01:37:01.600
[Guest]: But I think we have to work with an imagination of government that starts from outcomes.

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:08.060
[Guest]: To say all children have the right to go to a school and achieve a basic level of proficiency

01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:12.080
[Guest]: in reading, writing, arithmetic, whatever it is, some five things, right?

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:18.480
[Guest]: All children have the right to learn for their careers, the things that truly interest them.

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:25.160
[Guest]: If you started from those things, you could ask whether the schools are doing that.

01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:29.000
[Guest]: And you could also ask what other ways of doing that could be if the schools are not

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
[Guest]: doing that.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:37.360
[Guest]: But if you don't, if you instead say, look, if you go to the BDA, for example, the Development

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:42.600
[Guest]: Authority in your city, the DDA, the BDAs, MMDA, CMDA, wherever you are, the DAs will

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:46.160
[Guest]: all tell you that they are going to build 50,000 houses this year.

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.680
[Guest]: And they'll tell you that it's a good thing, they're going to build 50,000 houses this

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:50.680
[Unknown]: year.

01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:53.560
[Guest]: But if you say, what is the demand for houses in your city this year?

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:56.560
[Guest]: And the answer to that question is 750,000.

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:59.720
[Guest]: And then they want to tell you they're going to build 50,000 houses.

01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:03.040
[Guest]: Your obvious next question would be, what is the matter with you?

01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:06.320
[Guest]: Who is going to build the other 700,000 houses?

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:13.960
[Guest]: So I think the problem with our stance to governance, the passive stance of too many

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:19.840
[Guest]: people to governance, is that there is a tremendous disconnect between what is done, or what is

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.120
[Guest]: being done and what is needed to be done.

01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:28.080
[Guest]: Even the smallest thing can be presented as an example of what is needed to be done.

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:35.280
[Guest]: But the fact that it is small only emerges by comparing it with what is needed.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:41.240
[Guest]: And that's what we're not able to do, that this seems like a detail that ordinary people

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:49.120
[Guest]: are unable to grasp in any sense, because it is a detail, it is a detail.

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:56.800
[Guest]: Unfortunately, we have not allowed ourselves familiarity with details, and we want good

01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:59.640
[Guest]: outcomes without familiarity with the details.

01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:05.040
[Guest]: And I'm really sorry about this, but that's not going to happen.

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:10.940
[Guest]: Societies that don't grapple with the details cannot have a reasonable expectation of good

01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:11.940
[Guest]: outcomes.

01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:17.040
[Guest]: The details are critically important to good outcomes.

01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:21.840
[Guest]: And so when we tell ourselves that this is a level of detail I can't engage with, it's

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:27.000
[Guest]: equivalent to saying, those good outcomes are not that important to me, that I'm willing

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.080
[Amit Varma]: to engage with.

01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:32.680
[Amit Varma]: So when you were talking about BDA, DDA, all of these different DAs, I was just thanking

01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:37.120
[Amit Varma]: God there's no PDA, Podcast Development Authority, because I would never get a license from them

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:39.200
[Amit Varma]: to do my podcast.

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:41.040
[Amit Varma]: It's probably coming.

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.040
[Amit Varma]: It's probably coming.

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:43.040
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.040
[Amit Varma]: Be scared, Mr. Verma.

01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Be very scared.

01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:50.080
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, just speaking of our fear of details, and it's what Public Choice Service

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:55.720
[Amit Varma]: would call rational ignorance, that, you know, because, you know, your willingness to delve

01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:01.560
[Amit Varma]: into the details of anything, it will be proportional to that process, that effort being useful

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.560
[Amit Varma]: to you.

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:07.800
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, because most of us can't affect the actions of government, or so we think,

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.460
[Amit Varma]: we don't delve into details, and that's what they call rational ignorance.

01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:16.360
[Amit Varma]: But it also strikes me that some of this apathy is actually also logical, because, you know,

01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.280
[Amit Varma]: it's not that people don't want to get involved in governance outside of their everyday lives.

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:24.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, during the pandemic, it's become a meme how housing societies have suddenly sprung

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:25.600
[Amit Varma]: into actions.

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:29.720
[Amit Varma]: And I've, you know, even in my own housing society, I see, you know, power corrupting

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:33.320
[Amit Varma]: and all kinds of crazy things happening.

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:37.140
[Amit Varma]: So people do get involved outside of their professions and personal lives.

01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:42.120
[Amit Varma]: But in local government, I can see why that would not happen, because there is, and Shruti

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:45.680
[Amit Varma]: Rajgopalan spoke about it very well in an episode on urban governance, she did a long

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:50.360
[Amit Varma]: time back with me, there is this disconnect between power and accountability, that just

01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:54.960
[Amit Varma]: looking at the example of Mumbai and Maharashtra, for example, that, you know, the people who

01:40:54.960 --> 01:41:00.320
[Amit Varma]: actually have the power to make Mumbai a better city to live in and bring about great outcomes

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:04.320
[Amit Varma]: are not accountable to me, they're more looking at rural votes and all of that, and my vote

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:05.560
[Amit Varma]: doesn't matter to them.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:10.440
[Amit Varma]: And my vote would matter to people at a municipal level, the ward councillor or whatever that

01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:14.520
[Amit Varma]: is, I don't even know what those designations are, or who those people are.

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:18.200
[Amit Varma]: And the reason I don't know is that they might be accountable to me and my vote might make

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:22.380
[Amit Varma]: a difference, but they have no power to actually do anything.

01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:24.200
[Amit Varma]: So take me a little bit.

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:29.320
[Amit Varma]: So one, is this an accurate summation of a structural problem that we have in our government?

01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:34.440
[Amit Varma]: And two, give me a historical sense of this, that how has this kind of evolved?

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:39.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you sent me this excellent white paper called A New Urban India a few days ago before

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:41.440
[Amit Varma]: we set up this episode.

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:46.280
[Amit Varma]: And that has a lot of background on this, our urban governance legacy, so to say, and

01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:51.520
[Amit Varma]: then the role that the 74th amendment tried to, the changes it tried to bring about, but

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.200
[Amit Varma]: we are still far from really getting there.

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:56.760
[Amit Varma]: So give me a sense of the history of these structural issues.

01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:57.760
[Guest]: We'll get to that.

01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:03.040
[Guest]: Before that, I want to say something short in response to what you asked.

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:06.200
[Guest]: Your vote is a kind of voice.

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:12.880
[Guest]: If it is the only time you give voice to your voice, then it's not very powerful.

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:17.560
[Guest]: But if there are other times too, in which you're giving voice to your voice, then your

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:20.560
[Guest]: vote is actually quite a bit more powerful.

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:27.080
[Guest]: If you, for example, just as an experiment, even a gedankenexperiment, not even a real

01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:33.560
[Guest]: one, if you were to say that before the next election, I'm going to write to 200 people

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:40.120
[Guest]: that I know that live in my locality and tell them who I'm going to vote for and why.

01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.120
[Guest]: Write wrong.

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:42.120
[Guest]: Leave that.

01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:49.960
[Guest]: If you actually took that step, the guy who thinks your vote is not that important will

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:54.040
[Guest]: come to you to influence that communication.

01:42:54.040 --> 01:43:00.440
[Guest]: And what I'm trying to point out is the vote is a kind of voice, that it is by continuously

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:08.520
[Guest]: having that voice that your vote gains the full power that it is vested with.

01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:19.200
[Guest]: That merely pressing a button on election day is not adequate to gain that full capacity

01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.200
[Guest]: for your voice.

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:21.200
[Guest]: So that's something to think about.

01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:24.560
[Guest]: There's a whole bunch of other things that need to be done.

01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:29.440
[Guest]: Probably there are four commissions in India that have all failed to do their job.

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:34.320
[Guest]: If these four commissions do their job properly, a lot of things can improve really quickly.

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:40.760
[Guest]: Two of them don't exist at all, so you can't even blame them for not doing their job because

01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:44.400
[Guest]: they don't really, quote unquote, even exist.

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:48.680
[Guest]: So you can blame somebody else for not even keeping these in existence.

01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:54.160
[Guest]: The first is the election commission, everybody's legend now, the extent of failure in the election

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.160
[Guest]: commission.

01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:58.480
[Guest]: So I won't go into it too much.

01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:06.840
[Guest]: But the two commissions that matter the most in the Indian urban context are the Municipalization

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:14.160
[Guest]: Commission and the Delimitation Commission, and these are both important entities.

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:22.880
[Guest]: The Municipalization Commission is supposed to decide when an area has transformed by

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:32.400
[Guest]: some measure from being rural to urban, and therefore is not any more governed under the

01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:37.560
[Guest]: 73rd Amendment of the Constitution, which applies to rural governments, but is instead

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:43.320
[Guest]: governed under the 74th Amendment of the Constitution, which applies to urban areas.

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:52.400
[Guest]: So municipalization is something that doesn't really exist in a continuous way.

01:44:52.400 --> 01:45:02.080
[Guest]: States tend to set them up at their whim and fancy, and those commissions often make large

01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:09.920
[Guest]: numbers of exceptions to the rules for municipalizing an area, so that even if it says that an agglomeration

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:16.920
[Guest]: with more than 5,000 residents should be treated as a small town, incorporated town, you will

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:20.920
[Guest]: still have scenarios in which there are villages with 25,000 people.

01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:26.960
[Guest]: And there's no good explanation for why that is, because it's a completely political process

01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:35.560
[Guest]: of deciding when an area is no longer village-franchised, but is actually a town council at some level.

01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:42.440
[Guest]: And this also undercounts and under-represents the extent of urbanization in India.

01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:48.040
[Guest]: I'm sure there are states in India that are more than 60-65% urban, but the broad narrative

01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:53.600
[Guest]: about urbanization in India is that we are somewhere at around 30-35%.

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:58.880
[Guest]: That is probably at least a 15% undercount across the country.

01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:07.160
[Guest]: And this has implications, because many budgets are divided between rural and urban schemes

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:11.760
[Guest]: in ratios that are decided by such classification.

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:16.840
[Guest]: So if you decide that one-third of the state is urban, you would give one-third of the

01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:17.840
[Guest]: budget to urban stock.

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:22.680
[Guest]: But if you decide that one-half of the state is urban, one-half of the budget would go

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:25.000
[Guest]: to addressing urban problems.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:33.680
[Guest]: So the political class, which is now dominated by rural politics, has a vested interest in

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:40.000
[Guest]: slowing down and delaying municipalization itself, because municipalization effectively

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:46.200
[Guest]: is a flow of money away from systems that they are familiar with, money and power.

01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:53.640
[Guest]: So this is one problem, that the municipalization does not happen periodically and predictably.

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:58.520
[Guest]: But it is completely subject to the whims and fancies of state governments.

01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:03.880
[Guest]: The second commission that also should exist in a continuous fashion, but does not again

01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:07.400
[Guest]: exist in a continuous fashion, is a delimitation commission.

01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:14.800
[Guest]: A delimitation commission is supposed to say that the population of a certain local governance

01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:21.240
[Guest]: area, like a municipal council or a village concierge, is changing, and that subdivisions

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:30.480
[Guest]: of wards within that municipality have to reflect the most recent distribution of people

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:31.480
[Guest]: in that area.

01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:41.960
[Guest]: And therefore, to give roughly each voter equal voice through their vote in elections.

01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:47.840
[Guest]: But this too does not exist, the current municipal council, the one whose term just ended in

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:58.720
[Guest]: February, its ward boundaries were actually based on the 2001 census, just 20 years ago.

01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:05.840
[Guest]: So, and you might say that's a legacy of having done it this way in 2010, but we're about

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:12.520
[Guest]: to do in 2011, in 2021, we're about to set up a set of boundaries based on the 2011 census.

01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:17.880
[Guest]: Knowing fully well, the 3 million people have moved to the city, mostly into the outer wards

01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:19.640
[Guest]: during that time.

01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:26.880
[Guest]: It's almost like we pretend that this, even the census of India today, does make projections

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:33.440
[Guest]: for intervening years, there is a 2011 census and a 2021 census, but it's not like there

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:35.800
[Guest]: is no data for 2020.

01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:41.560
[Guest]: So there's no reason why in 2020, you have to work with 2011 data.

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:46.480
[Guest]: But a political system that is comfortable with the past arrangement will always pick

01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:51.880
[Guest]: the oldest possible data set that it can work with, and for whatever decision that is made

01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:52.880
[Unknown]: in the present.

01:48:52.880 --> 01:49:00.840
[Guest]: So you're going to get in every municipality, a huge gap between the change in population

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:04.320
[Guest]: driven by urbanization, especially the largest cities, the largest cities are having insane

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:05.320
[Guest]: numbers of people.

01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:13.000
[Guest]: I mean, 800 to 1000 people come to Bangalore every day, net, right?

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.640
[Guest]: So during the course of your show, about 100 more people are going to become Bangaloreans,

01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:19.640
[Unknown]: right?

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:26.880
[Guest]: And if the show were being done in Delhi, that number would be 1000 or 1100 people per

01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:29.880
[Guest]: day, more than another 30% more.

01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:34.840
[Guest]: So in a way, we're looking at a situation where very large numbers of people are moving

01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:40.360
[Guest]: to the larger metropolitan areas, these metropolitan areas continue to be governed through really

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:43.880
[Guest]: unwieldy and large municipal councils.

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:49.320
[Guest]: I remember one conversation with a municipal commissioner, who was fortunate enough to

01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:53.600
[Guest]: serve several years as a municipal commissioner, even our current commissioner has actually

01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:55.760
[Guest]: been in office for quite some time.

01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:00.680
[Guest]: But I think it's a safe bet that he's moving to more than half or two thirds of the wards

01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:07.480
[Guest]: in the city, because the nature of the job is such that you can actually traverse, understand

01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:12.720
[Guest]: and govern a very large city in any meaningful way.

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:16.120
[Guest]: But we have not yet become comfortable with small government.

01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:22.800
[Guest]: I mean, the Thatcherite Reaganist argument is that you need to be comfortable with small

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:23.800
[Guest]: government.

01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:27.800
[Guest]: And their way of talking about small government is that you don't, you know, the government

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:32.520
[Guest]: doesn't have too many rights and too much people to enforce those rights.

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:36.840
[Guest]: But I'm saying we don't even meet the basic standard of a small government, our governments

01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:41.120
[Guest]: are not even close enough to the people that we consider physically small.

01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:47.960
[Guest]: That if you live in a city of 13 million people, represented by a single council, the very

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:53.240
[Guest]: act of being organized in that way creates distance between you and the voter and the

01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:57.600
[Guest]: council, which is actually never going to be helpful.

01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:01.080
[Guest]: But are you willing to say that municipal councils should not really be more than a

01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:05.720
[Guest]: million people or 2 million people, that a large metropolitan area like Mumbai or Delhi

01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:10.640
[Guest]: should have 5, 6, 8, 10 municipalities within them?

01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:14.880
[Guest]: So I actually think that because we don't ask those questions, we don't get to the answers

01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:15.880
[Guest]: for those things.

01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:18.480
[Unknown]: It's unfortunate, but that's how it is.

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:27.840
[Guest]: So the municipalization and delimitation slows down and delays the voice of urban citizens.

01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:34.080
[Guest]: And the very act of delaying the voice of urban citizens puts you in a development deficit.

01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:37.520
[Guest]: And you're always scrambling to overcome that deficit.

01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:43.680
[Guest]: And that's really been the history of urbanization across the country again and again and again.

01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:50.560
[Guest]: The only place, ironically, where they tried to sort of keep pace with this to some extent

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:51.560
[Guest]: was Bengal.

01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:57.520
[Guest]: And you could put that down partly to communist rule, perhaps, that they actually had in the

01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:03.920
[Guest]: Kolkata metropolitan area, many, many 30-odd municipal councils, whereas everywhere else

01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:08.920
[Guest]: there are fewer than half a dozen, even today, even in Mumbai.

01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:12.560
[Guest]: I don't know if there are more than 7 or 8 municipal councils in a very large area.

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:18.560
[Guest]: Delhi has four, Bangalore still has one, Hyderabad is talking about making it 7 or 3 or 4.

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:23.120
[Guest]: Really, these are areas that could easily have multiple municipal councils and an overarching

01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:26.160
[Guest]: layer of planning across those municipal councils.

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:30.880
[Guest]: If you go to Metro Manila, just as an example, in a developing country, if you go to Metro

01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:36.400
[Guest]: Manila, you will find 15, 20 cities within what you call Manila.

01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:42.160
[Guest]: And there is a Metro Manila planning body, which works across all of those.

01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:49.840
[Guest]: The guy that you call the Mayor of London, I forget what his name is, he's actually not

01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:53.520
[Guest]: an administrative mayor, he's a planning mayor.

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:56.360
[Guest]: The Livingstons and the Boris Johnsons are all planning mayors.

01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:01.560
[Guest]: They did not actually, except for police and transport for London, they were not really

01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:05.680
[Guest]: involved in the administration of any of those things.

01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:08.320
[Guest]: Many other things in the city, those were left to the boroughs of London.

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:10.920
[Guest]: And there are 33 boroughs in London.

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:14.200
[Guest]: Most people don't realize that there are 33 boroughs and the mayor is just a planning

01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:15.200
[Guest]: mayor.

01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:19.880
[Guest]: He's in charge of something called the Greater London Authority, he's not the administrative

01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:21.640
[Guest]: head of any of the boroughs.

01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:27.560
[Guest]: So in a way, the Constitution of India does provide for a planning layer across multiple

01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:28.560
[Guest]: municipalities.

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:31.960
[Guest]: And if you thought of this correctly, you could even set this up.

01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:36.280
[Guest]: And here's another downside of the historical legacy.

01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:43.480
[Guest]: In every district, you have a Zilla Parishad, it's kind of an interesting thing.

01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:52.560
[Guest]: A Zilla Parishad in the Panchayati Raj system is the highest tier of a multi-tiered rural

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.280
[Guest]: governance system.

01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:58.160
[Guest]: So you have the Gram Panchayat, then you have the Mandal Panchayat, sometimes you have the

01:53:58.160 --> 01:53:59.160
[Guest]: Taluk Panchayat as well.

01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:05.560
[Guest]: And then you have a Zilla Parishad at the highest level, which effectively is a representative

01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:12.520
[Guest]: amalgamation of all the sort of lower panchayats in the city with representation from each

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:13.520
[Guest]: of them.

01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:18.240
[Guest]: You don't even have the equivalent for the urban areas.

01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:24.960
[Guest]: There is no Zilla Urban Council, there's no District Urban Council, instead what you have

01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:29.920
[Guest]: is a District Commissioner, who's typically a 27-year-old who passed the IAS exam four

01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:33.720
[Unknown]: years ago, maybe if you're fortunate he's 31 years old.

01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:40.680
[Guest]: But what I'm trying to say is that we have completely substituted representative democracy

01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:49.080
[Guest]: at the district level with mere public administration in urban areas primarily, whereas what you

01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:55.560
[Guest]: really should have is a Zilla Parishad that is from both the urban and the rural areas

01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:56.560
[Guest]: together.

01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:01.760
[Unknown]: There's no reason, this is what I mean by saying this is like a diet for the left side

01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:02.760
[Unknown]: of your body.

01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:08.040
[Unknown]: You've got a Zilla Parishad that's somehow supposed to make the village areas better.

01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:15.360
[Guest]: While you don't have any system in place for the urban areas at all, you will get a kind

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:21.280
[Guest]: of grotesque kind of arm-wrestler out of this, who could easily have his own left side defeat

01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:22.640
[Guest]: his right side.

01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:28.560
[Guest]: And that's inevitably what ends up happening, that rather than building oneself up to be

01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:34.760
[Guest]: overall strong, we imagine some selective strength in a way that is only useful to defeat

01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:37.920
[Guest]: ourselves again and again.

01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:43.560
[Guest]: So the structure of government itself is now anti-urban, it's not just standing in the

01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:50.520
[Guest]: way, it's willfully anti-urban, and we have to understand that, that this is not merely

01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:56.880
[Guest]: the result of that structure, it's the result of saying we don't really want a transfer

01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:04.040
[Guest]: of power from rural governance to urban governance, and this is in some sense pacified by the

01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:10.720
[Guest]: romanticism around villages from the past, dating back to Gandhi's unfortunate comment

01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:11.720
[Guest]: about villagers.

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:19.080
[Guest]: I'm much more of an Ambedkarite in thinking about villagers, but even apart from that,

01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:25.400
[Guest]: I think it is now important to say people are voting with their feet.

01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:29.600
[Guest]: So we tend to think of voting as something that happens only at a ballot box, but people

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:35.280
[Guest]: vote with their wallets and they vote with their feet too, and the voting with their

01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:42.120
[Guest]: feet is now telling you what they prefer, but the political system is highly unresponsive

01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:49.680
[Guest]: to how people vote with their feet, and this is the biggest gap in our response to urbanization

01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:50.680
[Guest]: today.

01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:55.880
[Guest]: It is happening, the political system is not recognizing that it is happening, the reason

01:56:55.880 --> 01:57:02.680
[Guest]: it is not recognizing it, the reasons are political, and because that recognition is

01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:10.120
[Guest]: left to the very people whose political interests run contrary to reality, you're not going

01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:11.120
[Guest]: to get this outcome.

01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:18.680
[Guest]: So this becomes the Chakra view, you can recognize it, you can go into it, but it's not easy

01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:24.120
[Guest]: to come out of it, and Arjuna is distracted.

01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:32.280
[Guest]: So you know, you keep sending a poor young warrior to fight lonely battles in these places.

01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:37.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I love the image of feeding only the left side of the body, and India does seem

01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:41.600
[Amit Varma]: to be a little bit like an arm wrestler, which is wrestling with itself and, you know, twisting

01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:47.380
[Amit Varma]: itself into grotesque shapes as it both wins and loses at the same time.

01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:51.240
[Amit Varma]: Some thoughts from this one, of course, to sort of, you know, mention an interesting

01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:55.760
[Amit Varma]: paradox, which is you brought up the Reaganite, Thatcherite conception of the small state,

01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:00.880
[Amit Varma]: and in some senses, India is both too small a state and too big a state, it's too small

01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:05.000
[Amit Varma]: a state in the sense that we don't even do the basic things properly, which a state should

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.640
[Amit Varma]: do, like provide the rule of law and so on.

01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:09.720
[Amit Varma]: And we don't even do those.

01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:12.100
[Amit Varma]: So you could argue that in those ways, we are too small.

01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:15.480
[Amit Varma]: But you could also argue that we are too big, because we do a million other things and get

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:21.160
[Amit Varma]: our tentacles into a million other pies, predate upon people in different ways.

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:26.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we are, you know, while we should be a protective state, we are really a parasitic

01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:28.160
[Amit Varma]: and predatory state.

01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:31.520
[Amit Varma]: But you know, leaving that aside, moving on, you spoke about the definition of...

01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:37.800
[Guest]: Before you walk past that line too quickly, I would say, the state is only parasitic towards

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:38.800
[Guest]: those who don't engage it.

01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:44.920
[Guest]: But think of that, the state is not parasitic towards those who engage it.

01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:50.080
[Guest]: We tend to think that those who engage it are doing it for crony vested purposes.

01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:53.360
[Guest]: But, okay, let's take that at face value.

01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:57.400
[Guest]: The quality of the road in front of your house is your vested interest.

01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:59.960
[Guest]: Let's not pretend that it is not.

01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:03.520
[Guest]: What is stopping you from engaging the state for that vested interest?

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:08.480
[Guest]: And I guarantee you, if you engage the state for that vested interest, it would not ignore

01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:09.480
[Amit Varma]: you.

01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:10.480
[Amit Varma]: My...

01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, that's really optimistic.

01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:15.400
[Amit Varma]: I would say that just as public choice say to speak of rational ignorance, I can also

01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:17.000
[Amit Varma]: speak of rational apathy.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.760
[Amit Varma]: I don't engage with the state about the state of the road outside because I know nothing

01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:21.840
[Amit Varma]: is going to come of it.

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:23.200
[Amit Varma]: So why waste my time?

01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:25.600
[Amit Varma]: Why not just kind of get on with my life?

01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:30.080
[Amit Varma]: And whether I'm wrong or right in this belief, I think most people do kind of believe like

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:31.080
[Amit Varma]: this.

01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:34.600
[Amit Varma]: And I think the parasitic and predatory nature of the state is set up in the design of the

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:40.120
[Amit Varma]: state where it has too much power, where its incentives are aligned in such a way that

01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:43.360
[Amit Varma]: it will never give up any of that power, obviously.

01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:46.080
[Amit Varma]: And you know, it is...

01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:53.880
[Guest]: I wouldn't call this ignorance, but I would call this inconsistent with the data.

01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:56.880
[Guest]: Let me put it that way.

01:59:56.880 --> 02:00:03.960
[Guest]: What I mean by that, what I mean by that is that people who engage with the state would

02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:06.200
[Guest]: tell you that their experience has been different.

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:10.280
[Guest]: Nobody would touch the road in front of my street without my knowledge, in front of my

02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:11.280
[Guest]: house without my knowledge.

02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:12.800
[Guest]: The reason is not power.

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:17.400
[Guest]: The reason is I know them as people.

02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:24.120
[Guest]: It's embarrassing for a guy to be doing things in front of your house if he knows you.

02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:26.040
[Guest]: Believe me on that.

02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:30.760
[Guest]: Once you get the psychology of that thing in your head, it becomes easy to understand

02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:32.560
[Guest]: why they're not going to do that.

02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:38.880
[Guest]: Problems being what they are, the public choice theory being what it is, he still knows you.

02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:43.160
[Guest]: The day you walk up to him and say, you could at least have told me of this thing, and if

02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:48.560
[Guest]: it needed coordination with three other departments, I would have helped get that thing done.

02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:52.160
[Guest]: Once he can ignore you on that, the second time he won't even ignore you, you actually

02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:53.160
[Guest]: know the guy.

02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:54.800
[Guest]: You see, it's the same thing.

02:00:54.800 --> 02:01:01.880
[Guest]: It's like if something is wrong with my best phone connection, with my electricity connection,

02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:05.080
[Guest]: I usually will not call their helpline.

02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:10.720
[Guest]: Even though I know there is a helpline, I will call the guy that actually works in my

02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:11.720
[Amit Varma]: subdivision.

02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:14.360
[Amit Varma]: Ashwin, number one, I'd say that you're very privileged to be able to do that.

02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:18.720
[Amit Varma]: But number two, I'd say that you're speaking at a very local level of engagement.

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:23.440
[Amit Varma]: I'd say at a broader level of engagement, for example, consider that 95% of my taxes

02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:24.440
[Amit Varma]: are just predated.

02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:26.240
[Amit Varma]: They don't go towards productive things.

02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:30.840
[Amit Varma]: They go towards building big statues and towards bailing out inefficient public sector banks

02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:31.840
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:35.320
[Amit Varma]: They basically count as utterly illegitimate uses of money.

02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:40.400
[Amit Varma]: I have no way, even if I engage with the state, I have no, there is no hope in hell that the

02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:43.200
[Amit Varma]: level of that predation will come down.

02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:44.200
[Amit Varma]: It simply will not.

02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:52.360
[Guest]: Well, here's what I know for a fact, that it's much easier, that first, that predation

02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:54.120
[Guest]: is a house of cards.

02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:59.240
[Guest]: First, it stands on the shoulders of your local elected representative.

02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:07.440
[Guest]: And the reason you know that for a fact is that even a prime minister of India, I'm not

02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:11.440
[Unknown]: necessarily talking about only this prime minister, but going back for 20 years of various

02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:16.720
[Guest]: urban missions in this country, even a prime minister of India cannot make things happen

02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:21.800
[Guest]: in your city that your local corporator does not want.

02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:28.560
[Guest]: On the contrary, that if he wants to do something, even the prime minister cannot stop it.

02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:33.400
[Guest]: So what I'm trying to tell you is that this house of cards is not built at the top.

02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:39.160
[Guest]: It's built at the bottom, that any change that you believe is going to happen or should

02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:49.120
[Guest]: happen is most likely to be made to happen only at the bottom, that the arrangements

02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:55.160
[Guest]: of power at the top are far too removed from you to be able to influence them.

02:02:55.160 --> 02:03:00.640
[Guest]: You're correct in assessing that, but nonetheless, they are not as far removed from the foundations

02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:05.640
[Guest]: within their own parties at the bottom, and the guys at that bottom are not removed from

02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:06.640
[Guest]: you.

02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:08.320
[Guest]: You actually know where he lives.

02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:12.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but you know, the structural problem here, and we'll move on from this, because

02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:13.680
[Amit Varma]: let's get back to the core issue.

02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:18.200
[Amit Varma]: But the structural problem here is again, what public choice theorists would call diffuse

02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:20.200
[Amit Varma]: costs and concentrated benefits.

02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:25.360
[Amit Varma]: The costs of this predation are diffused among so many people that it is, you know, difficult

02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:31.320
[Amit Varma]: to sort of mobilize them to kind of, you know, create a strong enough incentive for your

02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:36.160
[Amit Varma]: local corporator to stand up for you and for local corporators everywhere to stand up for

02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:37.920
[Amit Varma]: you and for the system to change.

02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:42.960
[Amit Varma]: My money is going to be used to bail out inefficient public sector banks and to give bad loans

02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:45.520
[Amit Varma]: to cronies who are too close to the powers that be.

02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:49.200
[Amit Varma]: No matter what I do, my involvement is not going to change that, Ashwin.

02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:53.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm a little bit sort of fatalistic about this.

02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:59.240
[Amit Varma]: But you know, I mean, how it would change is if government was much more local.

02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:03.760
[Amit Varma]: And as far as, you know, local governance matters, I completely buy your point.

02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:08.200
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, a lot of the things you said, even in our last episode, sort of gave me

02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:09.480
[Amit Varma]: tons of insight about that.

02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:11.680
[Amit Varma]: So I want to kind of explore that further.

02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:16.680
[Amit Varma]: One the definitional question, which you pointed out, what is a city and what is not a city?

02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:18.000
[Amit Varma]: What is urban and what is not urban?

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.480
[Amit Varma]: I did an episode 108 of the scene and the unseen with Ruben Abraham and Pritika Hingorani.

02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:25.880
[Amit Varma]: And we spoke about that in detail and why it's important.

02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:30.720
[Amit Varma]: Now in your paper also, you know, you've added a bunch of nuance, which I'd like to quote

02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:35.600
[Amit Varma]: from that paper to sort of put it out there for my listeners that you speak about.

02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:39.200
[Amit Varma]: One, of course, we all know that we are becoming more and more urban in the future, isn't the

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:41.200
[Amit Varma]: cities and people are voting with their feet.

02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:42.440
[Amit Varma]: That's a revealed preference.

02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:46.520
[Amit Varma]: Even people who romanticize the villages do it from their city home.

02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:48.240
[Amit Varma]: So like, give me a break.

02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:54.480
[Amit Varma]: Now you point out three different ways, three different patterns in which India is urbanizing.

02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:59.520
[Amit Varma]: And I'll quote from your paper now, one, the addition of numbers to existing cities, two,

02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:05.000
[Amit Varma]: the urbanization of older rural settlements, and three, large urban projects situated in

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:10.520
[Amit Varma]: panchayat areas isolated from their immediate physical and administrative surroundings.

02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:11.520
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:15.160
[Amit Varma]: And you point out about how they present different sets of challenges and all of that.

02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:19.660
[Amit Varma]: But then you say that one, this definitional problem is, you know, we have to get these

02:05:19.660 --> 02:05:24.640
[Amit Varma]: definitions right, because as you just elaborated upon minutes ago, it makes a difference to

02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:27.320
[Amit Varma]: the kind of governance that you get.

02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:33.900
[Amit Varma]: And two, you've also written about why we need a new framework of urban governance.

02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:36.440
[Amit Varma]: So lay out the vision for this new framework.

02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:42.320
[Guest]: I want to take the opportunity to criticize one more commission before we forget that.

02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:46.000
[Guest]: And this is the set of the finance commissions.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:52.400
[Guest]: The finance commissions are doing a terrible job, there's just no other way to sort of,

02:05:52.400 --> 02:06:00.760
[Guest]: they are supposed to assign pools of public money between different stewards of that money

02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:03.120
[Guest]: at different levels of government.

02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:09.400
[Guest]: The finance commissions have no reason to overlook the migration of people from rural

02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:10.840
[Guest]: to urban areas.

02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:16.240
[Guest]: So if they wanted to, they could easily make higher allocations for local councils and

02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:20.440
[Guest]: for urban related problems, number one, but they don't do that.

02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:24.040
[Unknown]: And the finance commissions typically tend to behave like agents of the highest body

02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:28.160
[Guest]: of the most highest level of government to whom they're making allocations.

02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:31.360
[Guest]: So the National Finance Commission behaves like it's an extension of the government of

02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:32.360
[Guest]: India.

02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:35.360
[Guest]: The State Finance Commission behaves like it's the extension of the state, you know,

02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:36.360
[Guest]: state government.

02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:40.960
[Guest]: So a couple of years ago, I was in, you know, I was giving a presentation to the State Finance

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:41.960
[Guest]: Commission.

02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:46.560
[Guest]: And I was actually telling them that you have more powers than you yourself seem to realize

02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:52.120
[Guest]: that if you wanted to, you could actually respond to the reality out there and make

02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:56.880
[Guest]: allocations of money commensurate to that reality.

02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:00.880
[Guest]: But they seem to believe that they had a greater obligation to the state government than they

02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:04.080
[Guest]: did to local government, number one.

02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:10.440
[Guest]: The second thing is that state governments, in particular, have been guilty of not setting

02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:15.080
[Guest]: up certain layers of administration at all, for example, the metropolitan planning body

02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:22.000
[Guest]: that is required to exist in a large area like Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, by and large,

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.200
[Guest]: these don't exist, right?

02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:29.880
[Guest]: Now, the State Finance Commission need not say, since these things don't exist, I'll

02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:31.880
[Guest]: not make any allocation to them.

02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:33.560
[Guest]: But that's what they do.

02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:41.920
[Guest]: They basically endorse the fact that statutory levels of government do not exist, and say

02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:46.760
[Guest]: there's no point in making allocations of money to them because they do not exist.

02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:52.160
[Guest]: My argument to that was, if you allocated money to the Metropolitan Planning Committee,

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:58.880
[Guest]: you can be sure that it would exist, because people would follow the money, right?

02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:04.640
[Guest]: Basically, what the Finance Commissions are doing today is a disservice to the organization

02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:10.360
[Guest]: of the country, and a disservice to the structures of government that are supposed to be in place

02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:12.720
[Guest]: to respond to that organization.

02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:18.360
[Guest]: So this is the third commission that has utterly failed, and it was the Election Commission.

02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:23.440
[Unknown]: The Election Commission has failed in another respect, which is that you can't even be sure

02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:26.280
[Guest]: that local bodies will have elections on time, right?

02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:31.000
[Guest]: I mean, frankly, the Election Commission has a very high level of preparedness for holding

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:36.720
[Guest]: state and national elections as per a calendar, but has never bothered to speak about the

02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:40.920
[Guest]: electoral calendar of local government at all, or even the electoral calendar.

02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:45.160
[Guest]: Now, one could argue that the states take the view that this is an administrative matter

02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:50.040
[Guest]: within the states, but that doesn't stop the Election Commission, which is quite happy

02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:53.120
[Unknown]: talking about simultaneous elections to Luxembourg and other states.

02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:57.560
[Guest]: There's no reason why it can't talk about an actual electoral issue, if it wants to.

02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:03.000
[Unknown]: But I feel, broadly, these four commissions, the Delimitation Commission, the Municipalization

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:08.920
[Guest]: Commission, the Election Commission, and the Finance Commission, but to varying degrees

02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:14.720
[Guest]: and for varying reasons, have collectively combined to let down, they're more like, no,

02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:16.960
[Guest]: they're all omissions rather than commissions.

02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:17.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:18.960
[Amit Varma]: Well said.

02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:24.960
[Amit Varma]: So, tell me about your sort of the governance framework that we really kind of need.

02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:29.920
[Amit Varma]: And also, you know, it seems to me that in some ways, the 74th Amendment was, you know,

02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:34.400
[Amit Varma]: in the early 90s, was a seminal moment in terms of empowering local governments.

02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:36.840
[Amit Varma]: But in another way, it wasn't because nothing really happened.

02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:40.640
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, much of what was laid out in it was not carried out.

02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:45.640
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, give me and give our listeners a sort of a sense of how the thinking towards

02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:50.600
[Amit Varma]: urban governance has been evolved, evolving and where it has fallen short.

02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:56.760
[Guest]: The thing to say even about Panchayati Raj is that the imagination of a new direction

02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:06.560
[Guest]: in law is often related to the political individuals whose imagination it is at birth.

02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:13.240
[Guest]: So one could argue that Ramakrishna Hegde really cared about Panchayati Raj and that

02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:18.680
[Guest]: with his passing from the political stage, a large part of the impetus for Panchayati

02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:19.680
[Guest]: Raj died in Karnataka.

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:20.680
[Guest]: One could make that claim.

02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:28.800
[Guest]: Alternately, you could say that somehow, some bizarre combination of Mani Iyer and Rajiv

02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:36.160
[Guest]: Gandhi produced the 74th Amendment, which was, in my opinion, very poorly drafted, despite

02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:41.000
[Guest]: an overall intent that one could find no room for.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:45.880
[Guest]: And even the people who actually worked on it 20 years later had concluded that what

02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:51.360
[Guest]: we have done with the 74th Amendment in particular is that we have overemphasized representation

02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:55.920
[Guest]: and under-emphasized leadership, which is why you don't really find people emerging

02:10:55.920 --> 02:11:02.760
[Guest]: from the bottom rungs of politics in India and rising to larger rungs, higher rungs through

02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:04.680
[Guest]: actual achievement in public office.

02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:09.520
[Guest]: There's a lot of parachuting that still happens in higher public offices.

02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:17.160
[Guest]: And that's partly because the leadership space at the local level is heavily suppressed.

02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:21.760
[Guest]: In our city, we have a situation where the mayor is changed every year.

02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:26.400
[Guest]: There's just no practical way in which he or she can ever be a leader, because by the

02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:30.760
[Guest]: time they figure out what the job is, they're sort of on their way out.

02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:35.240
[Guest]: And there's not a whole lot of leadership that can emerge in this way.

02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:38.560
[Guest]: Some other states have direct elections for mayors.

02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:43.040
[Guest]: I think, in general, it would be a useful practice to have direct elections for mayors

02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:44.040
[Guest]: and city presidents.

02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:49.120
[Guest]: But I also think it would be useful for the terms of mayors and city presidents to be

02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:50.880
[Unknown]: no more than three or four years.

02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:55.160
[Guest]: We have a situation in which your local corporator and the prime minister have the same term

02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:56.160
[Guest]: in office.

02:11:56.160 --> 02:12:02.920
[Guest]: And you have to ask yourself, is that really a good way to do this?

02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:08.120
[Guest]: I don't think we need corporators to have longer than three years in office, or even

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:13.880
[Guest]: two and a half years is probably enough in some way, that you have to have a mechanism

02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:17.920
[Guest]: for repeatedly taking the pulse of the people and their preference.

02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:25.240
[Guest]: But somehow, we seem to sort of not get that, that we don't actually think that going back

02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:32.280
[Guest]: to the people for reaffirmation of their voice and preference is a good thing, that the efficiency

02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:40.520
[Guest]: argument often runs contrary to the public will, because we tell ourselves in many, many

02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:46.280
[Guest]: circumstances that it's efficient to ignore the public and do the thing that seems to

02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:48.720
[Guest]: be right with or without them.

02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:51.880
[Guest]: And I think this has permeated the entire system.

02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:58.040
[Unknown]: There are lots of officials in particular who will tell you public engagement is a slippery

02:12:58.040 --> 02:12:59.040
[Guest]: slope.

02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:01.360
[Guest]: And you can see these with these master plans, right?

02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:05.920
[Guest]: The master plan is an interesting document in our cities, for two reasons.

02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:11.920
[Guest]: Master plans are supposed to be prepared through consultative processes.

02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:13.360
[Guest]: And invaluably, they're not.

02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:18.960
[Guest]: They're just sort of put up in some random way for a limited period of time.

02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:24.240
[Guest]: When BDA put up its master plan the last time, the email address at which they wanted you

02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:26.800
[Guest]: to respond with suggestions was itself wrong.

02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:29.120
[Guest]: But no such address actually existed.

02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:36.080
[Guest]: So they sort of go through the process, almost like a checkbox.

02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:40.280
[Guest]: But more than that, the master plans are wrong for another reason, that each master plan

02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:46.080
[Guest]: typically contains within it a set of planning districts for which the planning authorities

02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:50.560
[Guest]: are supposed to create town planning schemes for the implementation of the plan within

02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:53.080
[Guest]: each of those planning districts.

02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:57.320
[Guest]: As far as I know, no planning authorities actually carried out that second step.

02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:02.640
[Guest]: It's like saying, we're going to have a baby, we're just not going to feed it, right?

02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:06.440
[Guest]: And that's ridiculous, that if you're not going to feed the baby, you shouldn't be having

02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:08.440
[Guest]: the baby in the first place, right?

02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:11.080
[Guest]: It's a harsh comparison, I realize.

02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:12.400
[Guest]: But really, that's really what it is.

02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:18.240
[Guest]: We go to great lengths to develop a plan that we say is supposed to produce a certain outcome.

02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:21.920
[Guest]: But we don't take any of the intermediate steps needed to achieve that outcome.

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:28.240
[Guest]: Not only that, no state government feels obliged to fund any part of the plan in its budget.

02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:34.400
[Guest]: Then if you look at the budget of a state, any state, you will not find a section within

02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:39.840
[Guest]: it that says, here are the master plans that we have received from the 40 to 60-odd planning

02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:45.120
[Guest]: authorities in the state, and here is our statutory commitment to the budgets of each

02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:46.120
[Guest]: of those plans.

02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:49.080
[Guest]: You will not find that anywhere.

02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:54.520
[Guest]: So the planning bodies are making a plan that no one is obliged to fund.

02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:58.400
[Guest]: So what is the point of such a plan that you can make it to the cows come home, and you're

02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:01.360
[Guest]: not going to get any movement in that direction.

02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:08.960
[Guest]: So essentially, you have to break that cycle of one arm or branch of the government saying,

02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:12.760
[Guest]: I have nothing to do with the commitments that are made by another arm or branch of

02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:13.760
[Amit Varma]: the government.

02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:19.840
[Amit Varma]: So make this concrete for me, give me a sense of what a plan would contain, and what would

02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:26.400
[Amit Varma]: be the intermediate step which is not carried out, and who would be responsible for these

02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:27.400
[Amit Varma]: different stages.

02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:31.480
[Amit Varma]: Like you've mentioned in the last episode, we did together eloquently about how government

02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:35.720
[Amit Varma]: tends to work in silos, and they don't coordinate with each other, and so on and so forth.

02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:40.360
[Amit Varma]: But make it concrete, what specific thing would a plan contain or has a plan contained

02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:44.000
[Amit Varma]: in the past in your knowledge, and what are the intermediate steps that were not done

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.000
[Guest]: and why?

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:52.520
[Guest]: So I think a good plan should have three things, it should have a desired outcome, which can

02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:59.360
[Guest]: be spatial, economical, land use, it can cover, it should be comprehensive across all sectors,

02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:05.120
[Guest]: it should cover water, waste, energy, jobs, all sorts of things, it should be comprehensive,

02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:09.440
[Guest]: and it should have end goals in sight for the plan period.

02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:16.000
[Guest]: The second thing it should have is a set of intermediate plans for where you expect to

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.400
[Guest]: be along this journey of implementing the plan.

02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:26.400
[Guest]: I remember a conversation with Vijay Kelkar, almost 20 years ago, I'm going to say, maybe

02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:27.400
[Guest]: even more.

02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:33.400
[Guest]: At that time, the government had just passed this Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management

02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:37.360
[Guest]: Act, FRBM, I think it was called, and the idea was that they would balance the budget

02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:42.040
[Guest]: or keep the fiscal deficit under a certain number.

02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:50.120
[Guest]: And so, I met Dr. Kelkar, I'm going to say, nine months before the election, and he was

02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:56.160
[Guest]: saying that within the next three quarters, the government's fiscal targets would come

02:16:56.160 --> 02:17:02.160
[Guest]: in alignment to the FRBM Act, and of course, the very first thing that happened when the

02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:06.520
[Guest]: next government took power was that they deferred the implementation of the FRBM Act.

02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:09.760
[Unknown]: And the thing that I was pointing out is that if you're going to hit a certain target in

02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:14.440
[Guest]: 10 months or a year, you ought to be able to get one third of the way in the next three

02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:18.040
[Unknown]: months and half the way in the next three months and so on and so forth, so that you're

02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:20.760
[Guest]: seeing real progress towards an outcome like that.

02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:26.080
[Guest]: The idea that you're going to come to a planned outcome in 15 years without seeing any of

02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:30.080
[Guest]: the intermediate steps happen after two years or four years or six years or eight years

02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:31.080
[Guest]: is ridiculous.

02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:35.240
[Guest]: But when the plan is not implemented for the first two years, the planning authorities

02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:38.400
[Guest]: tell themselves, we still have 13 years to implement it, when they're not implemented

02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:41.480
[Guest]: for four years, they tell themselves, they have 11 years to implement it, and so on and

02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:42.480
[Guest]: so forth.

02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:45.200
[Unknown]: And then you come to the 11th year, and you have only four years to implement them, you're

02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:49.560
[Guest]: still telling yourself the same thing, and that's how you come to the 15th year.

02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:55.000
[Guest]: And if you look at the outcome in the city, and the actual plan that was made 15 or 20

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.200
[Guest]: years ago, they have no correlation to each other.

02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:03.760
[Guest]: And so what you need is a set of intermediate plans for what you might even call them annual

02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:09.160
[Guest]: plans that pursuant to a large master plan, here is what needs to happen in each of these

02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:16.480
[Guest]: years in two directions, one, that you break down the plan into implementable parts along

02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:17.480
[Guest]: the way.

02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:24.200
[Guest]: And second, that when the state government quote, unquote, approved the plan, that approval

02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:31.160
[Guest]: becomes an obligation on the part of the state government to fund each of these annual plans.

02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:34.960
[Guest]: Otherwise, the approval has no meaning, the state government says I like the plan, and

02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:35.960
[Guest]: therefore it is approved.

02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:39.920
[Unknown]: But when budget time comes around, they don't feel obliged to fund any part of it.

02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:46.040
[Guest]: So the approval of a plan must be accompanied by a statutory obligation on the state government

02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:47.040
[Guest]: to fund that.

02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:53.280
[Guest]: If you don't do these two things together that have intermediate steps for implementation,

02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:59.800
[Guest]: and assured funding for implementation, you're not going to get the outcome that you're imagining

02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:00.800
[Guest]: in the plan.

02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:06.680
[Guest]: But the entire exercise of planning, I was chief guest at the 50th anniversary, I'm going

02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:13.080
[Guest]: to say anniversary celebrations of the Department of Town and Country Planning, I think DTC

02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:18.760
[Guest]: is, either I alone or I with somebody else was chief guest at that event.

02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:22.480
[Guest]: And I pointed out to them that in 50 years, the department had not carried out a single

02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:25.480
[Guest]: town planning scheme anywhere in the state.

02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:32.400
[Guest]: And I actually challenged them to say in this year, together, some of you, one of you, subsets

02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:37.400
[Guest]: of you come up with just one town planning scheme, anywhere in the state, and I will

02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:40.720
[Guest]: work with you to get it implemented.

02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:45.280
[Guest]: But nobody in the town and country planning department wants to do that.

02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:51.120
[Guest]: They're quite happy, color coding the outcome, without getting into the details of how that

02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:53.160
[Guest]: outcome is going to be achieved.

02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:57.720
[Guest]: It's like saying, I'm going to send my child to school, they're going to graduate from

02:19:57.720 --> 02:19:58.720
[Guest]: high school in 12 years.

02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:04.040
[Guest]: But you know what, the school doesn't teach physics or mathematics or geography or history

02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:05.880
[Unknown]: or any of those kinds of things.

02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:09.960
[Amit Varma]: And you still keep telling yourself, my child is going to graduate in 12 years, in a school

02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:14.000
[Unknown]: that doesn't teach any of the subjects on which he's going to be tested in 12 years.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.300
[Guest]: That's really what's happened to our plans.

02:20:16.300 --> 02:20:21.360
[Amit Varma]: And how much of this is because these people in question aren't really accountable.

02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:26.600
[Amit Varma]: So 12 years later, there are a completely different set of people in charge in the bureaucracy.

02:20:26.600 --> 02:20:28.640
[Amit Varma]: And the politicians have moved on.

02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:32.880
[Amit Varma]: And anyway, they are focused only on the short term imperatives of the next elections.

02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:37.520
[Amit Varma]: So how much of that is because of the way the system is designed itself, like before

02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:42.560
[Amit Varma]: we kind of talk about before we lament the different ways in which the system doesn't

02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:47.680
[Amit Varma]: work, how much of this can just be sorted by the domino effects of fixing the design

02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:49.960
[Amit Varma]: of the system itself.

02:20:49.960 --> 02:20:53.320
[Amit Varma]: And if it would be sorted by that, what would those fixes be?

02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:57.920
[Guest]: I think this is a good question, because there is a certain what you might call budgetary

02:20:57.920 --> 02:21:02.920
[Guest]: distance between the voter and the decision maker.

02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:07.160
[Guest]: And there is one thing we can do to bridge budgetary distance.

02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:11.600
[Guest]: I think the ward committees should be funded directly.

02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:17.000
[Guest]: Just like municipalities have their funding, we should have a mechanism for funding the

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:18.880
[Guest]: ward committees directly.

02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:26.320
[Guest]: So that people in each area become familiar and comfortable with the idea of making decisions

02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:28.120
[Guest]: about public funds.

02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:34.120
[Guest]: Today, the everyday experience of the voter, or the every month experience of the voter,

02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:39.760
[Guest]: is completely disconnected from any decisions about what to do with public funds.

02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:42.920
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, it becomes difficult for you to understand what's happening with public

02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:48.080
[Guest]: money at higher levels, including the fact that they're laying out Punjab, not Punjab,

02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:49.080
[Guest]: some bank or the other.

02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:53.320
[Guest]: I forgot the name, some Maharashtra something bank, I remember that, right, with your taxpayer

02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:54.320
[Guest]: money.

02:21:54.320 --> 02:22:00.560
[Guest]: So in a way, I think it's useful to have the practice of engagement with public funds and

02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:07.640
[Guest]: funding the local committees at the citizen level could be a good experiment to get that

02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:08.640
[Guest]: going.

02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:12.400
[Guest]: I even proposed this in Delhi government some time ago, that saying, why are we funding

02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:20.200
[Guest]: only, you know, the MCDs with the different councils of Delhi, North, South, East and

02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:24.000
[Unknown]: New Delhi Municipal Corporation, you could actually directly fund the ward committees

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:29.160
[Guest]: of each of those councils, and let people in their respective areas also have voice

02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:33.720
[Guest]: in what projects are done in those areas, it may not be even a lot of money.

02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:38.720
[Guest]: But I think it is important to directly fund the ward committees.

02:22:38.720 --> 02:22:42.800
[Guest]: And if you did that, people would get more comfortable with this.

02:22:42.800 --> 02:22:47.760
[Guest]: And to some extent, the school management committees have a voice now in payments to

02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:49.960
[Guest]: teachers and things like that.

02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:53.840
[Guest]: So what you have to do is that you have to create a system for public administration

02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:59.760
[Guest]: in which there is increasing voter and citizen participation in the management of public

02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:00.760
[Guest]: funds.

02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:07.760
[Guest]: So if you see that presentation that I sent you, which I'll send you a PDF of it later,

02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:14.520
[Guest]: I call it the publicly managed city, right, it's the city, we have to think of the city

02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:22.400
[Guest]: as a space that is actually managed by the citizens too, not merely lived in by citizens.

02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:26.240
[Guest]: Citizens are not merely consumers of governance.

02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:33.120
[Guest]: The fundamental notion of a republic is deeply tied to the idea that citizens are also creators

02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:34.120
[Guest]: of governance.

02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:41.320
[Guest]: But this idea that I, Amit Verma, Ashwin Mahesh, is happy being only a consumer, and imagine

02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:45.360
[Guest]: that if you and I were the only two citizens in the country, and I was happy thinking that

02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:48.640
[Guest]: you would create all the outcomes I cared about, and you were happy thinking that I

02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:53.160
[Guest]: would create all the outcomes you cared about, there wouldn't be anybody to create those

02:23:53.160 --> 02:23:54.160
[Guest]: outcomes.

02:23:54.160 --> 02:23:56.080
[Unknown]: This is really what's happening at a large scale.

02:23:56.080 --> 02:24:00.280
[Guest]: Everyone tells themselves they're only a consumer of the outcomes that they want.

02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:02.920
[Guest]: There are not enough people actually going out and creating the outcomes.

02:24:02.920 --> 02:24:06.320
[Guest]: Or in fact, there are people going out and creating outcomes contrary to what you and

02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:07.320
[Guest]: I want.

02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:08.320
[Guest]: And some of it is quite brutal.

02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:14.240
[Guest]: I don't know if I sort of mentioned this in our earlier conversation, there was an interesting

02:24:14.240 --> 02:24:23.800
[Guest]: case about 10 years ago here, in which the court had ruled that people in a certain neighborhood

02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:28.280
[Guest]: needed to be given what they call a kata.

02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:33.320
[Guest]: In Bangalore, there are two kinds of katas, there are katas for actual legitimate buildings

02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:35.920
[Guest]: and katas for not-so-legitimate buildings.

02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:39.920
[Guest]: And these are called A-kata and B-kata, A being more legitimate.

02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:45.000
[Guest]: And so one set of people had gone and fought for their B-katas to be converted into A-katas.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:50.800
[Guest]: And the high court, after some prolonged hearing, had actually ruled in their favor.

02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:54.840
[Guest]: And so they went to the municipal corporation in their local neighborhood and said, well,

02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:58.480
[Guest]: let this thing change from B to A now.

02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:00.720
[Guest]: And there was a lot of stalling in that.

02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:05.080
[Guest]: And then there was a big protest outside the zonal office of the municipality, and it became

02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:06.080
[Unknown]: sort of a big thing.

02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:09.680
[Guest]: And at one point, and at that time I was in government, I was the Deputy Urban Advisor

02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:10.680
[Guest]: at that time.

02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:13.680
[Guest]: And somebody called me up and said, you know, can you sort of help?

02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:17.440
[Guest]: And I said, well, I educated myself a little bit about it.

02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:21.480
[Guest]: And then a little while later, the zonal commissioner called me and said, can you come here?

02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:24.160
[Guest]: I said, why do I need to come here?

02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:27.440
[Guest]: You've got orders from a court telling you what to do.

02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:30.000
[Guest]: What's the difficulty with doing it?

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.080
[Guest]: So he said, if you come here, I'll tell you.

02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:33.080
[Guest]: So I went over there.

02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:35.120
[Guest]: I was kind of curious too at this point.

02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:38.640
[Guest]: So I went over there and he said, Ashwin sir, this is the problem.

02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:44.480
[Guest]: This file on which I need to make the necessary annotation, it has been taken away by the

02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:48.320
[Guest]: bad guys physically from my office.

02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:56.520
[Guest]: So it's all very well for a court to say this should be done, but that doesn't contend with

02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:59.920
[Guest]: the reality that I'm not in physical possession of the file.

02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:02.200
[Guest]: What do you expect me to do now?

02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:05.360
[Guest]: So yes, even problems like that can be solved.

02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:07.960
[Guest]: I'm not going to get into how that got solved.

02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:15.480
[Guest]: But what I'm trying to tell you is that we imagine a techno managerial solution to problems

02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:19.000
[Guest]: that are fundamentally social and political.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:27.720
[Guest]: That sometimes the answer to the problem is not in how, it is in who.

02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:36.280
[Guest]: And the who has legitimacy by behaving like a compelling citizen, by behaving like a citizen

02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:40.360
[Guest]: who's comfortable with and engaged in politics.

02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:41.360
[Guest]: Then you can solve some of these problems.

02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:47.720
[Guest]: And that's why I told you earlier that when you say my one vote has little voice, if you

02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:51.800
[Guest]: wrote that letter to 200 people, you'd feel very differently about your voice and so would

02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:52.800
[Guest]: all your elected representatives.

02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:57.640
[Guest]: So I actually think that there are very many things that we can actually do to magnify

02:26:57.640 --> 02:26:58.640
[Guest]: our voice.

02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:02.880
[Guest]: And the fact that so many other people are quiet, in fact, would magnify your voice even

02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:07.680
[Guest]: more powerfully because you would have the advantage of their silence too.

02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:13.920
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, you know, Roger Daltrey and Entwistle and all of the members of the who would be

02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:16.760
[Amit Varma]: very excited because you just said the answer lies in the who.

02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:20.040
[Amit Varma]: But sort of jokes apart, you know, before we move on, what happened in that case?

02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:23.320
[Amit Varma]: How did you solve out that A khata B khata problem?

02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:26.280
[Guest]: You have to bend some people.

02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:27.280
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:33.000
[Amit Varma]: I won't, I won't get into the details of how you do that, but clearly concerned citizens

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000
[Amit Varma]: can achieve a lot.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:38.840
[Amit Varma]: Let me, let me sort of your document was fascinating and obviously your document, your presentation,

02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:41.920
[Amit Varma]: all those links will be there in the show notes for the readers to read.

02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:47.920
[Amit Varma]: But let me kind of try and simplify it for myself to understand what you're getting at

02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:49.320
[Amit Varma]: in terms of a new kind of governance.

02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:54.840
[Amit Varma]: And you can tell me if my sort of summation of it is broadly correct.

02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:58.960
[Amit Varma]: And you've proposed a number of reforms that need to be made, which we can discuss in detail

02:27:58.960 --> 02:27:59.960
[Amit Varma]: after this.

02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:04.200
[Amit Varma]: But the gist of what they do effectively is essentially changing the design of the system

02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:05.200
[Amit Varma]: and the incentives.

02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:08.340
[Amit Varma]: And there are a number of ways you point out in which that can be done.

02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Number one is that like you earlier pointed out, a very small percentage of our taxes

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.560
[Amit Varma]: actually go towards local administration.

02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:21.800
[Amit Varma]: So especially those taxes which are generated locally should go to the local administration.

02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:27.260
[Amit Varma]: So there is that link and therefore, you know, that builds that much more accountability

02:28:27.260 --> 02:28:31.740
[Amit Varma]: and that changes the incentives for them to actually perform to, you change the structure

02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:32.740
[Amit Varma]: of local governance.

02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:36.600
[Amit Varma]: So a, they are more empowered, of course, which is a whole new ballgame.

02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:43.560
[Amit Varma]: But also you try to create a empowered mayors, like, you know, back in the day in, in British

02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:47.960
[Amit Varma]: times, you know, Rajendra Prasad was a mayor of Patna at one point, people like Raj Gopalachari,

02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:54.200
[Amit Varma]: Nehru himself, Sardar Patel in Ahmedabad all played great roles, either as mayors or as

02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:56.540
[Amit Varma]: important people in the municipal councils.

02:28:56.540 --> 02:29:00.640
[Amit Varma]: And to bring that back, we need empowered mayors and yeah, and Subhash Chandra Bose,

02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:06.240
[Amit Varma]: of course, who was mayor of Kolkata, and Chitranjan Das, I think just before him, and we need

02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:07.240
[Amit Varma]: to sort of bring that back.

02:29:07.240 --> 02:29:10.640
[Amit Varma]: And there are various ways of designing that in terms of the power you give to them in

02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:15.380
[Amit Varma]: terms that you have, they should not be so short, so they have no time to make a difference,

02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:18.720
[Amit Varma]: but they should not be so long that you're not getting that constant feedback from the

02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:21.560
[Amit Varma]: public, which a healthy system needs.

02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:27.920
[Amit Varma]: Secondly, thirdly, you've spoken about the need for how whichever is a body in charge

02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:32.340
[Amit Varma]: of planning, in a way is breaking past the problem of different governments performing

02:29:32.340 --> 02:29:37.820
[Amit Varma]: in silos, because it is making these overarching plans and going down into detail.

02:29:37.820 --> 02:29:43.180
[Amit Varma]: And the fourth point that you point out, which is, you know, an important nuance is that

02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:46.940
[Amit Varma]: the departments in charge of planning and implementation have to be separate.

02:29:46.940 --> 02:29:52.500
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, you have sort of bad incentives, and that can lead to bad outcomes.

02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:57.900
[Amit Varma]: So these were sort of the interesting key structural reforms that struck me while I

02:29:57.900 --> 02:29:59.820
[Amit Varma]: was reading your paper.

02:29:59.820 --> 02:30:00.820
[Amit Varma]: One, is this broadly correct?

02:30:00.820 --> 02:30:03.740
[Amit Varma]: Two, have I missed out something important that you'd like to elaborate upon?

02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:05.900
[Guest]: No, I think these are broadly correct.

02:30:05.900 --> 02:30:10.300
[Guest]: And I sort of pick on some of these things in particular, because they have the potential

02:30:10.300 --> 02:30:11.300
[Guest]: for domino effects.

02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:16.380
[Guest]: The minute you say that planning and implementation have to be separated, some of the greater

02:30:16.380 --> 02:30:20.100
[Guest]: executive authority for implementation will move away from the planning body and close

02:30:20.100 --> 02:30:21.100
[Guest]: up to the municipalities.

02:30:21.100 --> 02:30:26.740
[Guest]: The minute you say that locally attributable taxes should accrue to the local municipality,

02:30:26.740 --> 02:30:30.980
[Guest]: it makes the executive office holders and the local councillors that much more powerful.

02:30:30.980 --> 02:30:35.420
[Unknown]: Because now I remember a conversation in Davangere, a few years ago with the mayor over there,

02:30:35.420 --> 02:30:38.420
[Unknown]: he said, why should I bother with economic development in my area?

02:30:38.420 --> 02:30:42.220
[Guest]: I'm not going to get any additional taxes to the council as a result of it.

02:30:42.220 --> 02:30:45.820
[Guest]: So I go and attract a major company to set up over here, create jobs and all of that

02:30:45.820 --> 02:30:46.820
[Unknown]: stuff.

02:30:46.820 --> 02:30:50.980
[Guest]: And virtually all of the taxes that that company and its people would pay go elsewhere.

02:30:50.980 --> 02:30:55.700
[Guest]: Whereas if you were to say that there are two or three locally attributable taxes, which

02:30:55.700 --> 02:30:58.620
[Guest]: are quite easy, for example, fuel taxes, right?

02:30:58.620 --> 02:31:03.180
[Guest]: You could easily give a portion of the fuel taxes to the municipalities in which the fuel

02:31:03.180 --> 02:31:05.340
[Guest]: stations are located.

02:31:05.340 --> 02:31:10.260
[Guest]: You could easily give a professional tax to the municipalities where the professionals

02:31:10.260 --> 02:31:11.260
[Guest]: are working.

02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:17.580
[Guest]: So there are a set of taxes that you can easily identify as originating from the local economy

02:31:17.580 --> 02:31:22.020
[Guest]: and for which the local council should have the right to a share.

02:31:22.020 --> 02:31:27.420
[Guest]: If you did that, every city would start to think that it could compete for more public

02:31:27.420 --> 02:31:35.340
[Guest]: money and begin to imagine its development as decided by monies that are within its control.

02:31:35.340 --> 02:31:39.340
[Guest]: Today most municipal bodies and panchayats are saying they're basically trying to figure

02:31:39.340 --> 02:31:41.740
[Guest]: out how much the state and the center are going to give them.

02:31:41.740 --> 02:31:47.380
[Guest]: And then they make a plan for what they're going to get as largest almost from these

02:31:47.380 --> 02:31:48.380
[Unknown]: things.

02:31:48.380 --> 02:31:51.480
[Guest]: And these things are not done fairly, as I said, by the finance commissions.

02:31:51.480 --> 02:31:56.660
[Guest]: So I actually think it's much better to create a system where our taxes can go more directly

02:31:56.660 --> 02:31:58.660
[Guest]: to the local councils.

02:31:58.660 --> 02:32:02.780
[Guest]: And frankly, even between the state and the center, I find this current practice of collection

02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:06.700
[Guest]: by the center and subsequent distribution to the states very problematic.

02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:08.780
[Guest]: We're seeing what's happening with GST.

02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:14.860
[Guest]: You have two contenders for a pool of money in which effectively there is the asymmetry

02:32:14.860 --> 02:32:15.860
[Guest]: of possession.

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:22.700
[Guest]: The center has possession of the money and therefore can afford delay in deciding the

02:32:22.700 --> 02:32:24.660
[Guest]: transfer of that money to the states.

02:32:24.660 --> 02:32:30.380
[Guest]: But I actually think that one could easily imagine a reverse system in which the states

02:32:30.380 --> 02:32:34.100
[Guest]: keep their portion and pass on the rest of the portion to the center.

02:32:34.100 --> 02:32:37.740
[Guest]: And if you were to set it up that way, perhaps the states would be in a stronger position.

02:32:37.740 --> 02:32:45.220
[Guest]: I'm just saying that too many of these collaborative systems between levels of government have

02:32:45.220 --> 02:32:49.580
[Guest]: become captured in the asymmetric power of one level of government.

02:32:49.580 --> 02:32:53.500
[Unknown]: And this is actually reinforced in the political parties where there is a notion that the MLA

02:32:53.500 --> 02:32:58.220
[Guest]: is more important than the corporator and the MP is more important than the MLA and

02:32:58.220 --> 02:32:59.220
[Guest]: so on and so forth.

02:32:59.220 --> 02:33:07.740
[Guest]: And the hierarchy of parties now reinforces the hierarchies that emanate from governance

02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:08.740
[Guest]: itself.

02:33:08.740 --> 02:33:09.740
[Guest]: And which is unfortunate, but also predictable.

02:33:09.740 --> 02:33:15.860
[Guest]: The hierarchy in the party is in fact derived from the powers that party people get when

02:33:15.860 --> 02:33:16.860
[Guest]: they are in government.

02:33:16.860 --> 02:33:20.820
[Guest]: And if government has a hierarchy, it's natural that the party will derive that hierarchy

02:33:20.820 --> 02:33:21.820
[Guest]: as well.

02:33:21.820 --> 02:33:27.900
[Guest]: So I think we need to get to a situation where we nearly see different levels of government

02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:35.020
[Guest]: as each being equally important to the totality of governance, but not that one level of government

02:33:35.020 --> 02:33:37.660
[Guest]: is inferior or superior to another level of government.

02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:42.620
[Guest]: They play a distinct and different role, but they're all equally important.

02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:46.060
[Guest]: You don't expect your local corporator to organize an army.

02:33:46.060 --> 02:33:47.340
[Guest]: He just can't do that.

02:33:47.340 --> 02:33:49.380
[Guest]: That's not his, anywhere near his job.

02:33:49.380 --> 02:33:50.940
[Guest]: There's a central government for that.

02:33:50.940 --> 02:33:55.340
[Guest]: But you can't expect the central government to have anything to do with cleaning up the

02:33:55.340 --> 02:34:00.540
[Guest]: streets in your neighborhood either, but which it seems quite willing to do, and not just

02:34:00.540 --> 02:34:01.540
[Guest]: this government.

02:34:01.540 --> 02:34:05.860
[Unknown]: I mean, I remember when JNU-RM started, and I think we should go back to the history of

02:34:05.860 --> 02:34:09.140
[Guest]: central intervention in urban governance.

02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:13.380
[Guest]: When the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission was started up, and this was, I'm going to

02:34:13.380 --> 02:34:19.100
[Guest]: say, in UPA, in the first term of the UPA, it was, at that time, Dr. Singh, who was prime

02:34:19.100 --> 02:34:24.060
[Guest]: minister, had even committed himself to his prime ministership being judged on administrative

02:34:24.060 --> 02:34:25.700
[Guest]: performance.

02:34:25.700 --> 02:34:29.900
[Guest]: And this was thought to be one of the first steps taken in that direction.

02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:36.500
[Guest]: It was a complete disaster, because the way it actually played out, it was a very nice,

02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:38.340
[Guest]: but very predictable game.

02:34:38.340 --> 02:34:43.140
[Guest]: So the center would pass a set of rules and laws saying these things should be done by

02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:44.140
[Guest]: the municipalities.

02:34:44.140 --> 02:34:48.820
[Guest]: And if the municipalities do those things, we'll give them some money.

02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:52.380
[Guest]: The municipalities will write a letter to the center saying, yes, we promise to do those

02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:56.100
[Unknown]: things, now give the first tranche of the money, and then the center will give the first

02:34:56.100 --> 02:34:57.100
[Unknown]: tranche of the money.

02:34:57.100 --> 02:35:00.540
[Guest]: And six months later, the center will write to the municipalities to say, what about those

02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:01.540
[Guest]: things you promised to do?

02:35:01.540 --> 02:35:02.540
[Guest]: Have you done that?

02:35:02.540 --> 02:35:06.460
[Unknown]: The municipalities will write back saying, well, you know, it's taking us a little time

02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:09.620
[Guest]: to get this started, but don't worry, we're on it, but meanwhile, can you give us the

02:35:09.620 --> 02:35:10.620
[Unknown]: second tranche of money?

02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:14.420
[Guest]: And the center would say, well, we're not very happy about this whole situation, but

02:35:14.420 --> 02:35:15.420
[Guest]: here's the second tranche anyway.

02:35:15.420 --> 02:35:21.060
[Guest]: And then this sort of would go on to the point where 90% of the money would be transferred

02:35:21.060 --> 02:35:24.540
[Guest]: without any of the actual promises being made.

02:35:24.540 --> 02:35:31.300
[Guest]: And everybody on both sides of this letter writing knew perfectly well what was happening.

02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:38.140
[Guest]: It's not that they somehow stumbled into the well in the dark, but they were quite clear

02:35:38.140 --> 02:35:44.220
[Guest]: that this is where it was going to go, but it was quite willfully done in that way.

02:35:44.220 --> 02:35:50.300
[Guest]: What it gives you is plausible deniability, but in fact, it was willful blindness more

02:35:50.300 --> 02:35:57.540
[Guest]: than plausible deniability, that nobody wanted the political system to change in favor of

02:35:57.540 --> 02:35:59.260
[Guest]: stronger local governments.

02:35:59.260 --> 02:36:06.540
[Guest]: And so they were trying to merely create flows of money intended to achieve administratively

02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:12.380
[Guest]: better outcomes without being committed to processes by which citizens could participate

02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:14.660
[Guest]: in improving those outcomes themselves.

02:36:14.660 --> 02:36:19.780
[Guest]: Whereas the first thing, if you really cared about urban development, you would simply

02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:24.100
[Guest]: say, I'm going to set up a delimitation commission that is permanent and is going to delimit

02:36:24.100 --> 02:36:29.700
[Guest]: all urban constituencies every 10 years and will make sure that all elections to all councils

02:36:29.700 --> 02:36:31.420
[Guest]: are held without a break.

02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:38.820
[Guest]: If you did this, you would get a rhythm to urban governance, which now actually exists

02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:44.020
[Guest]: in Panchayati Raj, more in the villages, far more than in the urban areas.

02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:50.500
[Guest]: So in a way, I think that the devil is in the details, unfortunately, but that's always

02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:52.180
[Guest]: going to be true.

02:36:52.180 --> 02:36:59.140
[Guest]: What we need is a way of responding to that reality by getting citizens to become familiar

02:36:59.140 --> 02:37:01.500
[Unknown]: and comfortable with the details.

02:37:01.500 --> 02:37:06.900
[Guest]: The idea that because these are details, it's difficult for citizens to engage them is self

02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:07.900
[Guest]: defeating.

02:37:07.900 --> 02:37:11.220
[Guest]: So you have to really ask and answer the question, how do I get ordinary people to be comfortable

02:37:11.220 --> 02:37:12.220
[Guest]: with the details?

02:37:12.220 --> 02:37:17.140
[Guest]: And things like funding ward committees are one way of getting people comfortable with

02:37:17.140 --> 02:37:18.540
[Guest]: the details.

02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:23.460
[Guest]: In South Africa, they tried another program, it's called a Neighborhood Improvement Partnership

02:37:23.460 --> 02:37:26.940
[Guest]: of some kind, a city improvement district, we would call it, then you could actually

02:37:26.940 --> 02:37:29.260
[Guest]: pay more taxes than you were required to pay.

02:37:29.260 --> 02:37:31.380
[Unknown]: I mean, this is a nice story.

02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:35.300
[Guest]: Imagine that you have to pay a hundred grand in taxes.

02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:38.060
[Guest]: You were allowed to pay a hundred and ten.

02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:39.060
[Guest]: Think of that.

02:37:39.060 --> 02:37:43.180
[Guest]: People would say, well, my taxes are a hundred grand, but I can pay a hundred and five or

02:37:43.180 --> 02:37:44.180
[Guest]: a hundred and ten.

02:37:44.180 --> 02:37:46.460
[Guest]: And people would say, well, nobody would do that.

02:37:46.460 --> 02:37:50.860
[Guest]: But there was an incentive to pay a hundred and five.

02:37:50.860 --> 02:37:54.300
[Guest]: The incentive was that if you paid a hundred and five or a hundred and ten, twenty-five

02:37:54.300 --> 02:37:58.180
[Guest]: would be given back to you to spend as you like in your area.

02:37:58.180 --> 02:38:03.380
[Guest]: Now think about that, but if enough people voted in favor of such a scheme, and there

02:38:03.380 --> 02:38:07.940
[Guest]: was a threshold, 60% of the people living in a locality had to sign up for this, and

02:38:07.940 --> 02:38:11.660
[Guest]: once they signed up, they would be obliged to pay a hundred and five, not just, it wouldn't

02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:12.660
[Guest]: be voluntary anymore.

02:38:12.660 --> 02:38:17.620
[Guest]: So, and it would be binding on the other 40% who didn't sign up too.

02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:20.820
[Guest]: So it was quite a powerfully done thing.

02:38:20.820 --> 02:38:26.460
[Guest]: And that's the other thing, that council resolutions in India don't have the weight of law.

02:38:26.460 --> 02:38:28.660
[Guest]: Only state and central governments make law.

02:38:28.660 --> 02:38:29.660
[Guest]: Councils don't make law.

02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:34.580
[Guest]: Whereas in many other parts of the world, councils can make laws within the local realm.

02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:37.420
[Guest]: We need to change that as well.

02:38:37.420 --> 02:38:42.860
[Guest]: But in any case, so they have this scheme, and so people started paying more taxes so

02:38:42.860 --> 02:38:46.860
[Guest]: that they could get control back of some of those taxes for implementing projects in their

02:38:46.860 --> 02:38:47.860
[Guest]: own areas.

02:38:47.860 --> 02:38:52.420
[Guest]: And initially, it was only the well-off neighborhoods that did that.

02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:56.620
[Guest]: But eventually, it did get to a point where even the poorer neighborhoods began to believe

02:38:56.620 --> 02:39:01.020
[Guest]: that by contributing a little bit more to the tax kitty, they would actually get outcomes

02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:06.020
[Guest]: for themselves that were better than what was being delivered by the government of the

02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:07.020
[Guest]: day.

02:39:07.020 --> 02:39:08.020
[Guest]: So they began to participate in some schemes too.

02:39:08.020 --> 02:39:09.020
[Guest]: And these are quite common in Canada.

02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:10.020
[Guest]: They're common in New Zealand.

02:39:10.020 --> 02:39:15.300
[Guest]: They're common in a few places where city improvement districts have been thought through

02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:16.300
[Guest]: in some way.

02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:23.260
[Guest]: So there are ways of building citizen participation linked to public funds that get lots of people

02:39:23.260 --> 02:39:26.020
[Guest]: comfortable with how money is used locally.

02:39:26.020 --> 02:39:30.580
[Guest]: If you think about it, if you live in a community, like I do, I live in a community of about,

02:39:30.580 --> 02:39:35.540
[Guest]: I'm going to say, 5,000 adults, like 2,000 families, 4,000 to 5,000 adults live in this

02:39:35.540 --> 02:39:37.140
[Guest]: community.

02:39:37.140 --> 02:39:40.740
[Guest]: It is still a community that is probably run by 25 people.

02:39:40.740 --> 02:39:46.780
[Guest]: And you might say 25 out of 5,000 is a really small number.

02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:53.260
[Guest]: But these 25 people have a reasonable experience of managing money on behalf of a much larger

02:39:53.260 --> 02:40:00.180
[Guest]: group of people, and therefore are probably even well-placed to understand the use of

02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:03.820
[Guest]: public funds in the local area in some way.

02:40:03.820 --> 02:40:08.580
[Guest]: And these are 25 people whose experience would not have existed previously when the communities

02:40:08.580 --> 02:40:10.620
[Guest]: were not organized like this.

02:40:10.620 --> 02:40:17.820
[Guest]: So in a way, I think we have to accept that details are an important part of the answer.

02:40:17.820 --> 02:40:22.860
[Guest]: Not everybody will be able to or willing to engage with the details, but the few who do

02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:31.940
[Guest]: or the some who do are performing a vital function in keeping alive a connection between

02:40:31.940 --> 02:40:38.220
[Guest]: the represented and the representative, and that connection has a multiplier effect because

02:40:38.220 --> 02:40:43.340
[Guest]: one of those 25 lives above me, I know I can go talk to him, even without being one of

02:40:43.340 --> 02:40:44.580
[Guest]: the 25.

02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:52.180
[Guest]: So in a way, I think this is why representative systems for money are probably more important

02:40:52.180 --> 02:40:58.460
[Guest]: than representative systems by themselves, that fundamentally people begin to understand

02:40:58.460 --> 02:41:05.020
[Guest]: the potential and the power of pooled funds by participating in these kinds of allocations.

02:41:05.020 --> 02:41:07.140
[Amit Varma]: And there's no reason why we can't do that.

02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:10.140
[Amit Varma]: It's not like the guys who are currently allocating money are geniuses.

02:41:10.140 --> 02:41:16.820
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm very taken in by your example of how the incentives of citizens also change when

02:41:16.820 --> 02:41:19.500
[Amit Varma]: they know that their money is going directly to a local body.

02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:23.160
[Amit Varma]: And if they feel that they have some control over where that is going, they might begin

02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:24.160
[Amit Varma]: to care more.

02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:28.700
[Amit Varma]: Though I'm a little kind of skeptical of the example you pointed out that, oh, if you pay

02:41:28.700 --> 02:41:32.260
[Amit Varma]: 105 instead of 100, we will give 25 back to you.

02:41:32.260 --> 02:41:35.940
[Amit Varma]: Because in any case, they should give 25 back to, you know, in any case, your tax money

02:41:35.940 --> 02:41:38.420
[Amit Varma]: should be used efficiently.

02:41:38.420 --> 02:41:43.140
[Amit Varma]: Why do you have to give a further incentive to the thieving state to, you know, give you

02:41:43.140 --> 02:41:44.940
[Amit Varma]: the services that you need?

02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:45.940
[Guest]: But sort of.

02:41:45.940 --> 02:41:46.940
[Guest]: Yeah, I thought about that.

02:41:46.940 --> 02:41:48.380
[Guest]: I thought about that.

02:41:48.380 --> 02:41:54.260
[Guest]: I actually think that in India, it would not be such a bad thing, because I think local

02:41:54.260 --> 02:41:56.940
[Guest]: taxation is very low, is very low.

02:41:56.940 --> 02:42:02.060
[Guest]: The property taxes that we pay in Mumbai, I think it's reasonably high.

02:42:02.060 --> 02:42:10.080
[Guest]: But elsewhere, the property taxes are pitifully low that we don't even pay in this city.

02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:15.780
[Guest]: I'm going to say, if you owned a house that was worth a crore of rupees or a building

02:42:15.780 --> 02:42:20.100
[Guest]: that was worth a crore of rupees, I don't think you would pay more than 7 or 8,000 rupees

02:42:20.100 --> 02:42:27.820
[Guest]: on average across different neighborhoods as the property tax per year on that building.

02:42:27.820 --> 02:42:34.300
[Guest]: If you did this in a developed country, an equivalently priced property would attract

02:42:34.300 --> 02:42:40.340
[Guest]: at least 10 to 20 times the taxation that it attracts here.

02:42:40.340 --> 02:42:46.420
[Guest]: So you would end up paying at least a lakh in taxes if the same property was in London.

02:42:46.420 --> 02:42:51.540
[Guest]: But one could argue that that's why London has a far higher level of public services

02:42:51.540 --> 02:42:52.540
[Guest]: as a result of it.

02:42:52.540 --> 02:42:58.140
[Guest]: But the broader point is that there's a trap in this as well.

02:42:58.140 --> 02:43:05.140
[Guest]: Politicians do not want to propose higher taxes on the public whose vote they are seeking.

02:43:05.140 --> 02:43:06.660
[Guest]: And this is an important thing.

02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:14.580
[Guest]: I think certain taxes must have regular and routine upticks.

02:43:14.580 --> 02:43:24.020
[Guest]: You can't have a property tax base that is so low and be trapped in a system where political

02:43:24.020 --> 02:43:28.780
[Guest]: leaders or political representatives are unwilling to change it for fear that they will not get

02:43:28.780 --> 02:43:29.780
[Unknown]: elected.

02:43:29.780 --> 02:43:33.340
[Guest]: In fact, now that there is no elected council, there's a proposal to increase the property

02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:37.860
[Guest]: taxes because nobody would take the heat for proposing such an increase.

02:43:37.860 --> 02:43:42.460
[Guest]: And administrators can be blamed for increasing taxes rather than political people having

02:43:42.460 --> 02:43:43.460
[Guest]: to take that heat.

02:43:43.460 --> 02:43:47.700
[Guest]: But I actually think that in the process, we have let ourselves down with public funds

02:43:47.700 --> 02:43:48.700
[Amit Varma]: quite a bit.

02:43:48.700 --> 02:43:53.340
[Amit Varma]: No, I think, you know, the broad thing here is that we can talk about the desirability

02:43:53.340 --> 02:43:57.240
[Amit Varma]: of these systems in an ideal world where you actually have responsive government which

02:43:57.240 --> 02:43:58.940
[Amit Varma]: uses these taxes well.

02:43:58.940 --> 02:44:03.820
[Amit Varma]: In the world that we live in, of course, every Indian will resist higher taxes because 99%

02:44:03.820 --> 02:44:07.420
[Amit Varma]: of the taxes are wasted anyway in a myriad different ways.

02:44:07.420 --> 02:44:12.980
[Amit Varma]: And we know that, you know, every Indian instinctively understands that it's a predatory state and

02:44:12.980 --> 02:44:17.540
[Amit Varma]: politics is basically a game of competing mafias fighting to have the monopoly on violence

02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:18.740
[Amit Varma]: that the state gives them.

02:44:18.740 --> 02:44:23.220
[Amit Varma]: But leaving that aside, moving on, the other broad question also, sort of one of the things

02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:27.700
[Amit Varma]: that struck me when you were speaking is about how the sort of hierarchy of importance within

02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:32.180
[Amit Varma]: the government from the center to the state to the local is mirrored within the parties.

02:44:32.180 --> 02:44:35.420
[Amit Varma]: And at that point, my instinctive thought, of course, was that, okay, it's like that

02:44:35.420 --> 02:44:36.420
[Amit Varma]: in India.

02:44:36.420 --> 02:44:37.420
[Amit Varma]: It's not like that elsewhere.

02:44:37.420 --> 02:44:40.860
[Amit Varma]: You'll have primaries in the US and all of that and it's a little more bottom up.

02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:45.740
[Amit Varma]: But I guess the way the party is organized would be driven by the way the spoils of power

02:44:45.740 --> 02:44:48.260
[Amit Varma]: are organized and how governance is organized.

02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:53.540
[Amit Varma]: Now we know that there is this centralizing impulse within the Indian polity and within

02:44:53.540 --> 02:44:57.540
[Amit Varma]: the Indian state, there is an impulse to consolidate its power in every way possible.

02:44:57.540 --> 02:45:01.340
[Amit Varma]: Now all of these reforms that we're talking about, that more local funds should go to

02:45:01.340 --> 02:45:07.060
[Amit Varma]: the local body, more, you know, the mayor should be more empowered and should have,

02:45:07.060 --> 02:45:13.300
[Amit Varma]: you know, falana dhimkana terms and all of that, all of that is dependent on certain

02:45:13.300 --> 02:45:19.220
[Amit Varma]: people who are in power giving up some of that power and working against their incentives

02:45:19.220 --> 02:45:20.260
[Amit Varma]: as it were.

02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:25.820
[Amit Varma]: So two part question, one is how likely are any of these fundamental changes to happen?

02:45:25.820 --> 02:45:31.340
[Amit Varma]: And the second part is that it seems that even in the absence of these fundamental changes,

02:45:31.340 --> 02:45:35.780
[Amit Varma]: concerned citizens like yourself and what you're doing in Bengaluru can actually go

02:45:35.780 --> 02:45:40.580
[Amit Varma]: out there and still make a difference by working hard with local government where, like you

02:45:40.580 --> 02:45:44.020
[Amit Varma]: pointed out, there are many people who want good outcomes, but don't know how to get it

02:45:44.020 --> 02:45:46.960
[Amit Varma]: and don't have the support from civil society.

02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:50.260
[Amit Varma]: But that second level where you can't make the fundamental changes, but you still get

02:45:50.260 --> 02:45:55.420
[Amit Varma]: involved and do things at a local level seems almost a jogar solution of sorts, right?

02:45:55.420 --> 02:46:00.660
[Amit Varma]: Because the state isn't working, let's create this additional layer of citizens who will

02:46:00.660 --> 02:46:04.620
[Amit Varma]: enable the state to do things that the state should have been able to do on its own in

02:46:04.620 --> 02:46:09.060
[Amit Varma]: the first place, but is not because it is dysfunctional.

02:46:09.060 --> 02:46:11.260
[Amit Varma]: So what's your response to sort of these two?

02:46:11.260 --> 02:46:12.260
[Guest]: I don't accept that.

02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:17.660
[Guest]: And I'll tell you why, that even if I were to be living in a much better functioning

02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:21.700
[Guest]: city, I would still look to do things more than the government is already doing.

02:46:21.700 --> 02:46:26.140
[Guest]: So it might lead to outcomes that are even better, but I wouldn't necessarily withdraw

02:46:26.140 --> 02:46:30.660
[Guest]: from engaging with government simply because I lived in a much better run city.

02:46:30.660 --> 02:46:36.900
[Guest]: I've lived in some reasonably well run cities, places like Seattle, for example, and I always

02:46:36.900 --> 02:46:41.620
[Guest]: felt inclined to work with public issues, even in places like that.

02:46:41.620 --> 02:46:46.380
[Unknown]: But coming to your first question, there is an opportunity that is emerging because the

02:46:46.380 --> 02:46:51.740
[Guest]: political class's preference for punting is now catching up to them.

02:46:51.740 --> 02:46:58.340
[Guest]: So you have to look at the history of what they did in response to urban migration and

02:46:58.340 --> 02:47:05.300
[Guest]: in response also to non-uniform population growth in states.

02:47:05.300 --> 02:47:11.620
[Guest]: So you have to remember that the Southern states stabilized their population at least

02:47:11.620 --> 02:47:16.380
[Guest]: two to three decades earlier than the Northern states.

02:47:16.380 --> 02:47:22.660
[Guest]: And there was a perception in the 70s in particular that states that were performing well in stabilizing

02:47:22.660 --> 02:47:28.220
[Guest]: their populations were in fact losing seats in parliament if those seats were distributed

02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:31.100
[Guest]: on the basis of population alone.

02:47:31.100 --> 02:47:37.140
[Guest]: So in the 42nd Amendment, I believe, it was frozen that representation of each state in

02:47:37.140 --> 02:47:42.980
[Guest]: parliament is, even today, frozen on the basis of the 1971 census.

02:47:42.980 --> 02:47:48.780
[Guest]: And the fact that population growth in UP and Bihar has been massively different from

02:47:48.780 --> 02:47:53.740
[Guest]: population growth in Kerala or Tamil Nadu does not count for anything, but the states

02:47:53.740 --> 02:47:59.180
[Guest]: have virtually the same number of seats they have in parliament as they did at that time,

02:47:59.180 --> 02:48:00.180
[Guest]: number one.

02:48:00.180 --> 02:48:02.780
[Guest]: And there is something to be argued against that.

02:48:02.780 --> 02:48:07.540
[Guest]: I understand that it sort of seems to defy the principle of one person, one vote.

02:48:07.540 --> 02:48:12.620
[Guest]: But in a federal republic, sometimes these compromises are necessary, and it was certainly

02:48:12.620 --> 02:48:14.620
[Guest]: seen as part of a political compromise.

02:48:14.620 --> 02:48:16.460
[Guest]: There's no doubt about that.

02:48:16.460 --> 02:48:25.340
[Guest]: And then came, during NDA 1, the realization that, so when the 42nd Amendment was passed

02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:31.860
[Guest]: in the 70s, it was agreed that for 30 years, representation in parliament would be on the

02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:32.860
[Guest]: basis of the 1971 census.

02:48:32.860 --> 02:48:38.900
[Guest]: And when we got to the 2001 census, the moment of reckoning had arrived.

02:48:38.900 --> 02:48:43.380
[Guest]: And so you had to sort of say, it might have been somebody else's punt in the past, but

02:48:43.380 --> 02:48:45.220
[Guest]: it is today's punt.

02:48:45.220 --> 02:48:50.460
[Guest]: And when that moment of reckoning arrived, a bunch of people, including Karunanidhi,

02:48:50.460 --> 02:48:57.900
[Guest]: Chandra Bavanayadu, various constituent supporters of NDA in particular, were extremely wary

02:48:57.900 --> 02:49:03.820
[Guest]: of sort of saying, well, let's now redo the number of seats on the basis of one person,

02:49:03.820 --> 02:49:08.620
[Guest]: one vote, because that would have meant that the southern states in particular would lose

02:49:08.620 --> 02:49:12.940
[Guest]: representation in parliament to some degree, if you redid the numbers.

02:49:12.940 --> 02:49:17.180
[Guest]: And so they came up with one more political compromise, and that was to say, for 25 more

02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:22.100
[Guest]: years, we will continue to use the 1971 census.

02:49:22.100 --> 02:49:27.460
[Guest]: But they did make one concession, which is to say that within states, we will redraw

02:49:27.460 --> 02:49:33.700
[Guest]: the boundaries of constituencies to reflect higher levels of migration from rural to urban

02:49:33.700 --> 02:49:34.700
[Guest]: areas.

02:49:34.700 --> 02:49:39.900
[Guest]: And this is why during the arts, you had this re-delimitation exercise, which one part of

02:49:39.900 --> 02:49:46.180
[Guest]: the country you lived in went through a delimitation of both parliamentary and state constituencies,

02:49:46.180 --> 02:49:50.740
[Guest]: but nonetheless keeping the overall numbers of those constituencies within a state the

02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:52.140
[Guest]: same as before.

02:49:52.140 --> 02:49:59.140
[Guest]: So, you know, Karnataka continues to have 220-odd seats in the legislature and 28 seats

02:49:59.140 --> 02:50:07.700
[Guest]: in parliament, but those 228-odd seats of 24, 25, whatever that number is, are not the

02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:13.260
[Guest]: same boundaries as they were previously, and the 28 parliamentary constituencies are also

02:50:13.260 --> 02:50:16.220
[Guest]: not the same boundaries as they were previously.

02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:24.260
[Guest]: So what you have is a situation in which the migratory patterns were accommodated in delimitation.

02:50:24.260 --> 02:50:28.780
[Guest]: But even that is not based on the 2001 census, that migration is accelerating and continuing,

02:50:28.780 --> 02:50:33.940
[Guest]: but you don't have further delimitation, and this is why I argued for delimitation again.

02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:41.780
[Guest]: Once you accepted the principle that inside a state, delimitation is permissible, there's

02:50:41.780 --> 02:50:47.300
[Guest]: no reason not to do it after every census, but the way it's set up is, oh, we'll look

02:50:47.300 --> 02:50:48.300
[Guest]: at it again in 2026.

02:50:48.300 --> 02:50:49.300
[Guest]: That doesn't make any sense.

02:50:49.300 --> 02:50:56.860
[Guest]: If it was worth looking at in 2003, it was surely worth looking at in 2012, and in 2022,

02:50:56.860 --> 02:50:57.860
[Guest]: without waiting for 2026.

02:50:57.860 --> 02:51:02.940
[Guest]: I actually believe that internal delimitation within the state should continue to happen

02:51:02.940 --> 02:51:03.940
[Guest]: after every census.

02:51:03.940 --> 02:51:12.540
[Guest]: If you did that, the constituencies will be more accurately reflective of trends in migration.

02:51:12.540 --> 02:51:17.780
[Guest]: So now we're coming to 2026, it's only five, six years away, so you're going to come to

02:51:17.780 --> 02:51:22.300
[Guest]: a second moment of reckoning, and here and there, those who talk about federalism will

02:51:22.300 --> 02:51:24.300
[Guest]: already be referring to that.

02:51:24.300 --> 02:51:30.940
[Guest]: You may have seen that as well, that essentially people are concerned that even this time,

02:51:30.940 --> 02:51:37.700
[Guest]: there cannot be any loss of representation in the national government compared to what

02:51:37.700 --> 02:51:38.700
[Guest]: they already have.

02:51:38.700 --> 02:51:44.500
[Guest]: And I actually think that if the federal argument were to pick up, one could imagine very many

02:51:44.500 --> 02:51:50.140
[Guest]: different ways of imagining the national government too, because in larger structures, it's not

02:51:50.140 --> 02:51:53.540
[Guest]: necessarily true that you have to sort of construct them in only one way.

02:51:53.540 --> 02:51:58.540
[Unknown]: If you look at the European Union, for example, the European Union has a rotating presidency.

02:51:58.540 --> 02:52:04.420
[Guest]: It doesn't seem to have done very much harm to the notion of a union.

02:52:04.420 --> 02:52:11.380
[Guest]: So one could argue that we are in some ways able to see and learn from other people's

02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:12.460
[Guest]: experiences.

02:52:12.460 --> 02:52:15.020
[Guest]: Many countries now have primary elections.

02:52:15.020 --> 02:52:17.980
[Guest]: Many countries have non-party primaries as well.

02:52:17.980 --> 02:52:26.580
[Guest]: So in a way, the unfortunate part in India is that because of the English language, we

02:52:26.580 --> 02:52:32.340
[Guest]: are more familiar with systems of government in the UK and the US.

02:52:32.340 --> 02:52:36.580
[Guest]: But among the developed countries of the world, these are the two worst examples that you

02:52:36.580 --> 02:52:39.100
[Guest]: could be following.

02:52:39.100 --> 02:52:45.100
[Guest]: That in fact, representative democracy is far deeper in the European Union, far deeper

02:52:45.100 --> 02:52:51.780
[Guest]: even in a Korea or a New Zealand or Australia than in the UK or in the US.

02:52:51.780 --> 02:52:57.580
[Guest]: The US, in fact, has a system of government in which the loser of the popular vote has

02:52:57.580 --> 02:53:00.980
[Guest]: a consistently high expectation of becoming the president anyway.

02:53:00.980 --> 02:53:05.660
[Guest]: It's a bizarre system that you can lose the popular vote by 3 million people and still

02:53:05.660 --> 02:53:08.100
[Guest]: become the president.

02:53:08.100 --> 02:53:12.820
[Guest]: The Republican Party has won the popular vote only once in the last 20 years, but they still

02:53:12.820 --> 02:53:17.500
[Unknown]: see themselves as an equal contender with the Democrats for the office of the president.

02:53:17.500 --> 02:53:22.300
[Guest]: So the sad part is that the US and the UK are really poor examples.

02:53:22.300 --> 02:53:27.180
[Guest]: But because virtually all the news that we get in India from abroad tends to be from

02:53:27.180 --> 02:53:30.860
[Guest]: these two countries, we don't imagine systems of government that are very different.

02:53:30.860 --> 02:53:36.300
[Guest]: The South Africans, for example, they had their first election only in the 90s, right?

02:53:36.300 --> 02:53:39.780
[Unknown]: But from the very outset, they have proportionate representation.

02:53:39.780 --> 02:53:45.220
[Guest]: Proportionate representation has made each vote count a lot more than the first-past-the-post

02:53:45.220 --> 02:53:46.220
[Guest]: system that we have.

02:53:46.220 --> 02:53:51.020
[Guest]: But the first-past-the-post system is what the UK and the US use, which very few other

02:53:51.020 --> 02:53:52.500
[Guest]: significant democracies use.

02:53:52.500 --> 02:53:58.180
[Guest]: Even in the UK, members of the European Parliament were not elected on a first-past-the-post

02:53:58.180 --> 02:53:59.180
[Guest]: system.

02:53:59.180 --> 02:54:01.020
[Guest]: They were elected on proportionate basis.

02:54:01.020 --> 02:54:06.900
[Guest]: So broadly, there are other systems of representative government that are proven to be better.

02:54:06.900 --> 02:54:10.060
[Guest]: So there's no reason why we can't be learning from those systems instead.

02:54:10.060 --> 02:54:15.940
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, in an episode, I think episode 149 that I did with JP Narayan, he made, you

02:54:15.940 --> 02:54:21.220
[Amit Varma]: know, many of the same points about proportional representation and all that.

02:54:21.220 --> 02:54:27.060
[Amit Varma]: And you seem to be talking of, you know, 2026 and, you know, as a sort of a potentially

02:54:27.060 --> 02:54:28.660
[Amit Varma]: pivotal moment in this.

02:54:28.660 --> 02:54:35.060
[Amit Varma]: But do you see, you know, a different direction emerging in the way that we, you know, practice

02:54:35.060 --> 02:54:39.740
[Amit Varma]: our democracy, whether it's the changing of the voting system or whether it's, you know,

02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:41.460
[Amit Varma]: in the level of federalism or whatever?

02:54:41.460 --> 02:54:46.260
[Amit Varma]: Do you, one, see a fundamental shift happening somewhere, and two, if there is, what do you

02:54:46.260 --> 02:54:49.580
[Amit Varma]: think will be the political impetus for that shift happening?

02:54:49.580 --> 02:54:57.940
[Guest]: So, the political, I mean, the proximate political impetus for whatever might happen in 2026

02:54:57.940 --> 02:55:04.140
[Guest]: is that if you do not do something, you will revert to the pre-1971 situation, therefore,

02:55:04.140 --> 02:55:06.460
[Guest]: you must do something.

02:55:06.460 --> 02:55:09.500
[Unknown]: So you don't have the luxury of not doing anything.

02:55:09.500 --> 02:55:14.820
[Guest]: So, the 42nd Amendment and the 84th or 87th, whichever amendment extended it to another

02:55:14.820 --> 02:55:18.340
[Guest]: 25 years, have sunset clauses.

02:55:18.340 --> 02:55:24.860
[Guest]: So the sunsetting of those amendments would put you in a pre-1971 situation, which would

02:55:24.860 --> 02:55:29.580
[Guest]: require delimitation on the basis of the most recent census and apportionment of seats on

02:55:29.580 --> 02:55:36.420
[Guest]: that basis, which I'm certain would be highly unacceptable to parties across low population

02:55:36.420 --> 02:55:37.420
[Guest]: growth states.

02:55:37.420 --> 02:55:41.940
[Guest]: And today, the difference between the low population growth states and the high population

02:55:41.940 --> 02:55:46.420
[Guest]: growth states is quite stark, even more so than it was in the 70s or the 90s.

02:55:46.420 --> 02:55:52.860
[Guest]: Today, if you read the vote on the basis of population within states, it's quite likely

02:55:52.860 --> 02:55:56.740
[Guest]: that Karnataka will lose three or four seats, Tamil Nadu will lose five or six seats, Kerala

02:55:56.740 --> 02:55:58.420
[Guest]: will lose two or three seats.

02:55:58.420 --> 02:56:02.380
[Guest]: You would get an across-the-board loss of 15 seats in the national parliament in South

02:56:02.380 --> 02:56:03.380
[Guest]: India.

02:56:03.380 --> 02:56:05.900
[Guest]: You might get similar losses of seats in the Northeast.

02:56:05.900 --> 02:56:12.820
[Guest]: You would essentially get, broadly, a government of North India, with a few others in support

02:56:12.820 --> 02:56:14.540
[Guest]: in election after election.

02:56:14.540 --> 02:56:21.580
[Guest]: So I think the same impetus that made people stand up in the 70s and the late 90s against

02:56:21.580 --> 02:56:28.260
[Guest]: the one person, one vote, continue to exist in regional politics even today.

02:56:28.260 --> 02:56:34.460
[Guest]: So I expect some sort of compromise from that to emerge, even if we have a dominant political

02:56:34.460 --> 02:56:38.820
[Guest]: party on one side of the spectrum.

02:56:38.820 --> 02:56:45.820
[Guest]: And I think, you know, the important thing is for us, both as a people and in a political

02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:51.660
[Guest]: class, to be able to navigate these kinds of questions responsibly, because they have

02:56:51.660 --> 02:56:56.260
[Guest]: the potential to become flashpoints as well.

02:56:56.260 --> 02:56:59.220
[Guest]: And therefore, responsible stewardship of these things is important.

02:56:59.220 --> 02:57:04.540
[Guest]: And I really, you know, I think NDA1 did a really good job of stewarding this with the

02:57:04.540 --> 02:57:08.100
[Guest]: compromise that was made on internal delimitation.

02:57:08.100 --> 02:57:13.860
[Guest]: I just wish it had gone further and made internal delimitation a decadal exercise rather than

02:57:13.860 --> 02:57:15.980
[Guest]: a one-time exercise.

02:57:15.980 --> 02:57:22.220
[Guest]: I think there are still enough people with maturity and, you know, genuine regard for

02:57:22.220 --> 02:57:28.740
[Guest]: the Indian Union to take this transition also in stride.

02:57:28.740 --> 02:57:34.020
[Guest]: But it requires a lot more people being supporters of such responsible stewardship as well.

02:57:34.020 --> 02:57:36.900
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, we've almost, we've hit the three-hour mark.

02:57:36.900 --> 02:57:40.460
[Amit Varma]: And here's an interesting question to sort of wind down towards the end of this episode,

02:57:40.460 --> 02:57:44.180
[Amit Varma]: which is, does good governance require good citizens?

02:57:44.180 --> 02:57:48.420
[Amit Varma]: Because at some level, what you seem to be saying is, and this seems almost directed

02:57:48.420 --> 02:57:51.460
[Amit Varma]: at me personally, that Amit, you are too apathetic.

02:57:51.460 --> 02:57:52.460
[Amit Varma]: You can make change.

02:57:52.460 --> 02:57:53.780
[Amit Varma]: Don't give up hope.

02:57:53.780 --> 02:57:57.700
[Amit Varma]: You have to get your butt out there and try to get change done and stop complaining about

02:57:57.700 --> 02:58:00.220
[Amit Varma]: the predatory state and then good things will happen.

02:58:00.220 --> 02:58:04.340
[Amit Varma]: The state will not only become less predatory, it will do the things that it is supposed

02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:05.340
[Amit Varma]: to do for you.

02:58:05.340 --> 02:58:10.100
[Amit Varma]: Now, I am a little skeptical about this because I think that the design of the state should

02:58:10.100 --> 02:58:14.420
[Amit Varma]: create such incentives which guarantee good governance without every citizen needing to

02:58:14.420 --> 02:58:15.420
[Amit Varma]: be a good citizen.

02:58:15.420 --> 02:58:20.300
[Amit Varma]: You know, in much the same way that one often says that you should design a state in such

02:58:20.300 --> 02:58:25.060
[Amit Varma]: a way with such checks and balances that even if a very bad person comes to power as a head

02:58:25.060 --> 02:58:30.100
[Amit Varma]: of the state, he can't do much damage because, you know, there are enough safeguards and

02:58:30.100 --> 02:58:31.100
[Amit Varma]: all built in.

02:58:31.100 --> 02:58:35.140
[Amit Varma]: Equally, I would say that you should design a state in such a way that you don't necessarily

02:58:35.140 --> 02:58:39.940
[Amit Varma]: need and require responsive citizens to go out of their way to make sure that the garbage

02:58:39.940 --> 02:58:42.420
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, picked up from outside the building.

02:58:42.420 --> 02:58:47.140
[Amit Varma]: It should be in the design of the system and the incentives of the state that it serves

02:58:47.140 --> 02:58:48.380
[Amit Varma]: you anyway.

02:58:48.380 --> 02:58:50.100
[Amit Varma]: So does good governance require good citizens?

02:58:50.100 --> 02:58:56.940
[Guest]: I want to read you a passage from Ken Robinson's book, The Element.

02:58:56.940 --> 02:58:59.740
[Guest]: My brother, Ian, is a musician.

02:58:59.740 --> 02:59:03.900
[Guest]: He plays drums, piano, and bass guitar.

02:59:03.900 --> 02:59:08.620
[Guest]: Years ago, he was in a band in Liverpool that included an extremely talented keyboard player

02:59:08.620 --> 02:59:11.260
[Guest]: named Charles.

02:59:11.260 --> 02:59:15.540
[Guest]: After one of their gigs, I told Charles how well I thought he played that night, and then

02:59:15.540 --> 02:59:19.500
[Guest]: I said, I'd love to be able to play keyboards like that.

02:59:19.500 --> 02:59:21.620
[Guest]: And he responded, no, you wouldn't.

02:59:21.620 --> 02:59:25.100
[Unknown]: I was taken aback by that, and I insisted that I really would love to be able to play

02:59:25.100 --> 02:59:26.100
[Guest]: keyboards like that.

02:59:26.100 --> 02:59:27.100
[Guest]: No, he said.

02:59:27.100 --> 02:59:30.100
[Guest]: You mean you like the idea of playing keyboards.

02:59:30.100 --> 02:59:34.100
[Guest]: If you'd really love to play them the way I'm doing it, you'd be doing it.

02:59:34.100 --> 02:59:39.300
[Guest]: To play as well as he did, he practiced every day for three or four hours in addition to

02:59:39.300 --> 02:59:40.300
[Guest]: performing.

02:59:40.300 --> 02:59:44.100
[Guest]: He'd been doing that since he was seven.

02:59:44.100 --> 02:59:49.500
[Guest]: You can see where I'm going with this, that a very large number of people have a certain

02:59:49.500 --> 02:59:58.060
[Guest]: imagination of their agency and willingness, which is fundamentally at odds with what they

02:59:58.060 --> 03:00:00.340
[Guest]: say they care about.

03:00:00.340 --> 03:00:01.340
[Guest]: This isn't hypocrisy.

03:00:01.340 --> 03:00:06.940
[Guest]: So, I want to be careful that I'm not accusing you of being hypocritical in saying that.

03:00:06.940 --> 03:00:15.060
[Guest]: But this is genuinely a failure to recognize what it takes to become a great keyboard player

03:00:15.060 --> 03:00:16.780
[Guest]: or as much a great citizen.

03:00:16.780 --> 03:00:21.460
[Guest]: There isn't an easy way to be a great citizen.

03:00:21.460 --> 03:00:26.980
[Guest]: And if we are looking for easy ways to become great citizens, then we're doing our country

03:00:26.980 --> 03:00:29.100
[Amit Varma]: a disservice.

03:00:29.100 --> 03:00:33.180
[Amit Varma]: That's actually orthogonal to what I asked because I'm not, you know, how we define a

03:00:33.180 --> 03:00:38.580
[Amit Varma]: great citizen can sort of differ, like I'm, you know, I don't understand why you have

03:00:38.580 --> 03:00:42.940
[Amit Varma]: to define a citizen as good or bad because citizens don't exist for the sake of the state.

03:00:42.940 --> 03:00:45.380
[Amit Varma]: The state exists for the sake of the citizens.

03:00:45.380 --> 03:00:47.340
[Amit Varma]: So I don't really care if a citizen is good or bad.

03:00:47.340 --> 03:00:49.180
[Amit Varma]: I care if the state is good or bad.

03:00:49.180 --> 03:00:54.020
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of that has to do with sort of the design of the state itself.

03:00:54.020 --> 03:00:58.020
[Amit Varma]: And so I don't even understand that this is not like keyboard playing.

03:00:58.020 --> 03:00:59.500
[Amit Varma]: I am, therefore I exist.

03:00:59.500 --> 03:01:00.500
[Amit Varma]: I am a citizen.

03:01:00.500 --> 03:01:01.500
[Amit Varma]: Good or bad for whom?

03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:04.180
[Guest]: I don't know, I'm not denying that.

03:01:04.180 --> 03:01:10.540
[Guest]: What I'm pointing out is the state is a construction of the citizens, that whereas there may have

03:01:10.540 --> 03:01:16.740
[Guest]: been one construction of it or several constructions of it in the past, it is nonetheless obligatory

03:01:16.740 --> 03:01:22.740
[Guest]: on our part to reimagine a new construction of it in line with our imagination of what

03:01:22.740 --> 03:01:24.380
[Guest]: we want it to be today, too.

03:01:24.380 --> 03:01:30.180
[Guest]: That's really what I'm trying to say, that we don't have to take prior constructions

03:01:30.180 --> 03:01:36.180
[Guest]: of the state as the only imagination of it possible today.

03:01:36.180 --> 03:01:45.540
[Guest]: And as much as it is difficult to engage with this really difficult beast in some way, and

03:01:45.540 --> 03:01:52.580
[Guest]: I think that's the part that I hear quite emotionally from you even, it is difficult.

03:01:52.580 --> 03:01:55.300
[Guest]: But I don't see any other way.

03:01:55.300 --> 03:01:56.300
[Guest]: That's all I'm really trying to say.

03:01:56.300 --> 03:02:03.140
[Guest]: I can't think of any other way that has even the limited potential of, it's sort of like

03:02:03.140 --> 03:02:10.500
[Guest]: saying you've come to an obstacle, a bunch of woods along your journey, and there's no

03:02:10.500 --> 03:02:11.500
[Unknown]: way around it.

03:02:11.500 --> 03:02:14.580
[Guest]: It's only through it that you have to go.

03:02:14.580 --> 03:02:18.740
[Guest]: And it's certainly true that going through it isn't easy, but I don't think there's any

03:02:18.740 --> 03:02:19.740
[Guest]: path around it.

03:02:19.740 --> 03:02:20.740
[Amit Varma]: No, no.

03:02:20.740 --> 03:02:25.700
[Amit Varma]: I just want to say that I would love it if 100% of my listeners are in 100% agreement

03:02:25.700 --> 03:02:28.180
[Amit Varma]: with you and they engage with the state and all of that.

03:02:28.180 --> 03:02:31.500
[Amit Varma]: I myself am inspired by a lot of what you say.

03:02:31.500 --> 03:02:35.340
[Amit Varma]: One thing that I'm trying to point out is, though I'm getting a little meta and I'm saying

03:02:35.340 --> 03:02:39.620
[Amit Varma]: that the locus of the problem is not the citizen's engagement with the state.

03:02:39.620 --> 03:02:45.340
[Amit Varma]: It is a design of the state, which is also at the same time a disincentive on the citizen

03:02:45.340 --> 03:02:50.260
[Amit Varma]: engaging with it, which is not therefore a reason for me to give up.

03:02:50.260 --> 03:02:56.100
[Amit Varma]: It is a reason for, I think, deeper thinking and not imagine that just engagement alone

03:02:56.100 --> 03:02:59.380
[Amit Varma]: is a solution, which I don't believe it is.

03:02:59.380 --> 03:03:04.860
[Amit Varma]: I think as much as we engage, and it's obviously a simultaneous process, as much as we engage

03:03:04.860 --> 03:03:10.620
[Amit Varma]: to get the state to be responsive in the ways that it can actually be responsive to us,

03:03:10.620 --> 03:03:16.980
[Amit Varma]: I think we also need to think about the broader root causes of the problem and take that seriously

03:03:16.980 --> 03:03:22.980
[Amit Varma]: and in whatever way we can keep that discourse going.

03:03:22.980 --> 03:03:24.980
[Guest]: I think we're saying the same thing to each other.

03:03:24.980 --> 03:03:28.700
[Guest]: This word alone wasn't added by me.

03:03:28.700 --> 03:03:32.740
[Guest]: I also did not contend that engagement alone is the answer.

03:03:32.740 --> 03:03:36.780
[Guest]: I think you're certainly right in pointing out that more than engagement is needed.

03:03:36.780 --> 03:03:40.940
[Guest]: I look at engagement as necessary but not sufficient.

03:03:40.940 --> 03:03:45.620
[Guest]: So in a way, so I say, look, if it's necessary but not sufficient, let's set about doing

03:03:45.620 --> 03:03:51.180
[Guest]: the necessary part, and perhaps the sufficient things will also emerge along the way.

03:03:51.180 --> 03:03:55.140
[Guest]: And maybe I'm just not bright enough to have thought about what the sufficient parts also

03:03:55.140 --> 03:03:56.140
[Guest]: are.

03:03:56.140 --> 03:04:01.340
[Guest]: But I also remember something that I said to you the last time we had such a long conversation,

03:04:01.340 --> 03:04:07.260
[Guest]: which was that I see myself as an inheritor of other people's struggles for a progressive

03:04:07.260 --> 03:04:13.780
[Guest]: society, that I would not say that someone like Gokhale failed because he did not live

03:04:13.780 --> 03:04:15.580
[Guest]: to see independence.

03:04:15.580 --> 03:04:21.700
[Guest]: I wouldn't say that somebody like Jayaprakash Narayan failed because the reimagination of

03:04:21.700 --> 03:04:26.180
[Guest]: land reform that he advocated didn't happen fully.

03:04:26.180 --> 03:04:32.740
[Guest]: I think each of us in our lives has a role to play in this larger imagination of the

03:04:32.740 --> 03:04:35.180
[Guest]: life of the country.

03:04:35.180 --> 03:04:39.380
[Guest]: And we have to be comfortable with the idea that we're contributing to it.

03:04:39.380 --> 03:04:40.380
[Guest]: And I've said this to you too.

03:04:40.380 --> 03:04:44.860
[Guest]: I think your podcast is an important contribution to these conversations.

03:04:44.860 --> 03:04:50.140
[Guest]: I heard Arvind say a few weeks ago on your show that you haven't really arrived as a

03:04:50.140 --> 03:04:54.580
[Guest]: public intellectual until you're on this show.

03:04:54.580 --> 03:04:58.700
[Unknown]: Anyway, I sent you my thoughts about that separately.

03:04:58.700 --> 03:05:03.780
[Unknown]: But in any event, I think programs like this are an important part of that journey as well.

03:05:03.780 --> 03:05:09.460
[Guest]: And I really, I think one could say at a much smaller level, is this enough?

03:05:09.460 --> 03:05:10.460
[Guest]: No.

03:05:10.460 --> 03:05:11.460
[Guest]: Is this necessary?

03:05:11.460 --> 03:05:12.460
[Guest]: Yes.

03:05:12.460 --> 03:05:13.460
[Guest]: I think it's necessary.

03:05:13.460 --> 03:05:14.460
[Amit Varma]: These are such wise words, Red.

03:05:14.460 --> 03:05:16.580
[Amit Varma]: I'll happily let you have the last word here.

03:05:16.580 --> 03:05:19.700
[Amit Varma]: Ashwin, thanks so much for being so generous with your time and insights.

03:05:19.700 --> 03:05:21.420
[Amit Varma]: I really appreciate you coming on the show.

03:05:21.420 --> 03:05:22.420
[Guest]: Okay.

03:05:22.420 --> 03:05:26.180
[Unknown]: You know, I have to say that I really enjoyed this conversation.

03:05:26.180 --> 03:05:32.100
[Guest]: I was a little bit at the beginning unsure how much of a conversation about urbanization

03:05:32.100 --> 03:05:35.180
[Guest]: alone we could have for a long period.

03:05:35.180 --> 03:05:40.700
[Guest]: I think, by and large, I've tended to do the longer episodes on your program, too.

03:05:40.700 --> 03:05:44.220
[Guest]: Even the last one was quite long.

03:05:44.220 --> 03:05:47.100
[Guest]: And I can see now we're above the three-hour mark.

03:05:47.100 --> 03:05:51.220
[Guest]: You should take some liberty to cut out certain things.

03:05:51.220 --> 03:05:54.660
[Guest]: But it's definitely been a good conversation for me.

03:05:54.660 --> 03:06:00.180
[Guest]: And sometimes I think these conversations educate me as much as I'm trying to tell my

03:06:00.180 --> 03:06:02.500
[Guest]: point of view to other people.

03:06:02.500 --> 03:06:07.460
[Guest]: I want to thank you also for the opportunity to come and have this conversation on your

03:06:07.460 --> 03:06:08.460
[Guest]: show.

03:06:08.460 --> 03:06:14.420
[Guest]: And if it disseminates a bunch of ideas that are interesting and important for others to

03:06:14.420 --> 03:06:19.940
[Guest]: engage with, that's really the thing that I'm trying to do.

03:06:19.940 --> 03:06:23.380
