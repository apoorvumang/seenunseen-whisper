[Amit Varma]: मैं मैंले एसां सकते हुआ रहना थी

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.120
[Amit Varma]: active blogger I used to get called to be a talking head and all of these TV shows have been on

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.000
[Amit Varma]: we the people have been on enough show before and became enough and the interesting strategy

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.920
[Amit Varma]: there is that you basically get time to say one or two sentences you go there the step what all the

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.120
[Amit Varma]: regular guests use as you go there prepared with your one or two lines and then you so which is

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.560
[Guest]: see which is what happens typically so uh you basically uh you know have let's say you know

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.520
[Guest]: when you go there you have four to five points listed out and then you uh you know say those

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.360
[Guest]: points when your opportunity comes the problem comes when they expect you to answer something

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.520
[Guest]: you have no clue of so like one day what happened was i was uh i was there for a discussion on some

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:09.880
[Guest]: topic uh you know dealing with i think economics and mamta banerjee suddenly started having a press

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.520
[Guest]: conference now what happens is typically that you know the way an anchor works is he or she

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:23.560
[Guest]: bounces off uh you know questions or ideas with someone who is present with him or her in the

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:30.200
[Guest]: studio so i happen to be the only one in the studio with the anchor at that point of time

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.120
[Guest]: so i was expected to have a view on west bengal as well and the politics of west bengal so those

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:42.680
[Guest]: situations can be you know politics is easy you know we all have an opinion but uh it's not

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.120
[Guest]: something that you know i'm really comfortable with so no and the interesting thing is that if

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.040
[Amit Varma]: you get pushed into a situation where you have to wing it and give an opinion then because you've

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.600
[Amit Varma]: given the opinion you start rationalizing the opinion and eventually actually which is so which

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.840
[Guest]: is what happened you know when i was a part of election coverage on tv and that happened you

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.800
[Guest]: know because you know initially i had said a few things and then i needed evidence to back that up

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.080
[Guest]: and then i started rationalizing it and then i started believing it this is a birth of political

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:19.240
[Guest]: ideology right here so and yeah i mean so that that tv does that to you and and in the and the

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.720
[Guest]: funny thing is i could see it happening it wasn't like i didn't realize what was happening when i

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.760
[Amit Varma]: but so like the homunculus though the vivek kaul inside vivek kaul is looking down at vivek

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:35.800
[Guest]: kaul doing all these things yeah so in the in this episode we're basically going to discuss

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:41.560
[Amit Varma]: the budget and we are going to discuss the state of the economy as it is and we went on twitter

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.120
[Amit Varma]: and facebook and asked people to give in questions and i think there are 143 questions we were going

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:54.600
[Guest]: to count yeah but it felt like 143 and uh no doubt as we are recording this is 143 a prime number

00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:01.560
[Amit Varma]: yeah yeah moment of silence don't edit the silence out i i want all my listeners to know

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:07.080
[Amit Varma]: my ignorance on this question let's just be honest here so so we'll get to those questions

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.040
[Amit Varma]: at the end of this episode but i have to tell you that i also receive three questions by postcard

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.600
[Amit Varma]: so i'm going to take you through those questions now no no really from postcard uh from a long way

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.800
[Amit Varma]: away so the first of those questions uh one of them is for me but two are for you so i'll space

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:29.000
[Amit Varma]: them out through the episode the first question uh dear vivek i must tell you how much i admire

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.040
[Amit Varma]: your deep insights on economics and your voice i love listening to your voice whenever there is

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.440
[Amit Varma]: too much stress at work i put on my headphones and play one of your old episodes with amit

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.560
[Amit Varma]: and i immediately feel at ease i really wish you were here with me now it is so hard to

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:50.680
[Amit Varma]: run a ministry on my own this letter is from nirmala s in delhi so a secret we are all going

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:58.680
[Amit Varma]: to go to arthur road soon what is arthur road there's a jail there a big one okay i mean i'll

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.480
[Amit Varma]: i'll i'll i'll come and visit whoever uh whichever one of my friends i mean you will also know

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.600
[Guest]: i haven't done anything i just happened to be what you mean i just happened to be here did you

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.560
[Amit Varma]: see what happened to hardik pandya and kl rahul what did kl rahul say that was wrong he was just

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.320
[Amit Varma]: there he just happened to be there so watch out vivek so let's let's uh getting back to uh an

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:27.320
[Amit Varma]: equally serious issue of of the budget in general um you know you've been covering economics i think

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.120
[Amit Varma]: for almost 15 years now as a as a writer on the subject did you follow the budget before that

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:38.760
[Guest]: uh like when did you first kind of get interested in the budget and so the first budget i actually

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:46.920
[Guest]: sort of was an active part of no was the budget in 2006 and i happened to be working for a

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:55.800
[Guest]: newspaper called dna back then and you know this was an era in which newspapers had started taking

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:02.840
[Guest]: you know a lot of interest in the budget and the idea was to sort of obviously dumb it down

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:08.520
[Guest]: and make everyone interested and so there was a lot of pre-packaged stuff that went into the

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:15.240
[Guest]: newspaper and i think that was the first budget that i really i mean i was well and truly a part of

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:22.600
[Guest]: uh but before that you know i did write on the budget without really being a part of you know

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.520
[Amit Varma]: any any media house or something and how much does the budget really matter because okay the

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.960
[Amit Varma]: government says that these are the revenues that are going to come in this is what we are going to

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:36.360
[Amit Varma]: do with it which is basically that's a summary of what it is but they don't actually end up

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:41.000
[Amit Varma]: necessarily getting those revenues which they forecast nor doing the things that they promised

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:49.240
[Guest]: to do yes which is true and uh i think see it's it's like any budgeting exercise you know when you

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:56.040
[Guest]: start you need a certain direction right now whether that uh you know whether the way you've

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.800
[Guest]: budgeted or whether the uh the you know whatever you want to achieve during the course of the year

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:07.400
[Guest]: happens or not is another thing altogether but you know everything needs a starting point

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:14.040
[Guest]: and as far as you know starting points go the budget is it is important having said that it's

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.720
[Guest]: not the only thing i mean you know if if you like and i'll give you a very very simple example

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:28.440
[Guest]: like uh in the last year's budget the government set a certain target which they wanted to uh

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:34.680
[Guest]: achieve on the goods and services tax front so basically uh you know goods and services tax is

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.080
[Guest]: collected by the central government and then it is divided between the central government and the

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:46.760
[Guest]: state governments okay so the central government hoped to earn uh around 6.04 lakh crore through

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:53.880
[Guest]: the central gst by the uh you know by the time six seven months had gone down it was very clear

00:11:53.880 --> 00:12:00.120
[Guest]: that they would not be able to earn that kind of money okay now what they did was that when

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.840
[Guest]: the next budget was presented which was in february which was the which was an interim

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:12.440
[Guest]: budget this time they revised the number lower to around 5.04 lakh crore so it was 100,000 crore

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:20.520
[Guest]: lower but even that lower number was not achievable and a lot of people including me wrote that at

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:27.640
[Guest]: that point of time and they finally ended up achieving rupees 4.58 lakh crore okay now uh

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:34.280
[Guest]: the point is that you know you had a certain uh target when you sort of came up with the budget

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:40.360
[Guest]: you had an opportunity to revise it you did revise it but you did not revise it as much as you

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:48.600
[Guest]: should have so you know obviously when you start uh there is a certain target in mind but as you

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:55.240
[Guest]: go along if that target is not achieved you also have an opportunity to revise it now the fact that

00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:01.080
[Guest]: they chose not to revise it or not to revise it as much as they should have is another thing

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.240
[Guest]: but you know so when when you start you need to know as to you know see as long as you know if

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:13.720
[Guest]: you don't know where your money is going to come from how will you decide how much can you spend

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:19.960
[Amit Varma]: so there's a broader question how much is economics nowadays hostage to politics

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:25.400
[Amit Varma]: for example uh the thing is that to get a sense of what's happening in the economy we need good

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:31.160
[Amit Varma]: data now clearly that good data is not there the data is essentially whatever data is put out by

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.200
[Amit Varma]: the government is in question all the time in fact last week i recorded a great episode on the gdp

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.360
[Amit Varma]: with the economist rajeshwari sengupta which was such a great episode i wanted to release it

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.400
[Amit Varma]: immediately but your fans were clamoring for this episode so we delayed it by a week but one of the

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.320
[Amit Varma]: points that she made there was that the whole process is completely opaque now and it just

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:54.280
[Amit Varma]: becomes a matter of faith which number you choose to accept and obviously there are smell tests of

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.480
[Amit Varma]: the sort that even you have done which can tell you whether you know it smells right or not but

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:06.360
[Amit Varma]: then the thing is when all the data when all the sources of data are so a sort of in question and

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.960
[Amit Varma]: also where the government is doing various kinds of jugaad to show itself in a good light jugaad

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:17.320
[Amit Varma]: with the numbers so that's not just in terms of how you define or measure the gdp which is an

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:24.040
[Amit Varma]: opaque system and that episode is out next week but even for example how um a friend of us pointed

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:29.240
[Amit Varma]: out that you know how expenditure by the government of last year has been managed quote unquote

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.720
[Amit Varma]: managed by not releasing funds to the food corporation of india and fci for the last

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.840
[Amit Varma]: uh three years has been borrowing from the national small savings fund so that the government

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:44.280
[Amit Varma]: can you know put a number in a particular light but this is a sort of a jugaad for the sake of

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.760
[Guest]: optics so i mean basically you know you asked three four questions so i'll try answering them

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:55.640
[Guest]: one by one see as far as data is concerned i think the quality of data or more than the quality even

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:04.840
[Guest]: the quantity and the availability of data now in 2019 is much better than it was in 2004 2003 uh

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:11.880
[Guest]: the second thing is that in 2003 or 2004 because the internet was what it was it was you know in

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:17.960
[Guest]: at least in india it was in a very rudimentary stage the uh data was not as easily available

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.720
[Guest]: as it is now i mean back then unless you had physical copies of documents and all

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:30.040
[Guest]: it was a little difficult to dig out uh data so to that extent the availability is a lot better

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:37.560
[Guest]: now than it used to be back then we also have a lot more data than we used to have uh back then

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:43.160
[Guest]: as far as the quality of data is concerned i think uh you know we are missing a point here

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.760
[Guest]: i don't think uh there is a doubt about all government data yes there is doubt about a few

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.520
[Guest]: a few data points here and there and uh you know the biggest of them being the gross domestic

00:15:54.520 --> 00:16:01.720
[Guest]: product which is basically a measure of uh the economic size of uh of a country in this case

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:09.960
[Guest]: india so the gdp numbers are in doubt a fiscal deficit is a tricky thing and i mean since you

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:17.880
[Guest]: raised the food corporation uh example so i'll sort of explain it in detail now basically food

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:24.280
[Guest]: corporation of india what does it do food corporation of india buys rice and wheat

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:32.680
[Guest]: primarily directly from the farmers at a certain price now this price is referred to as a minimum

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:41.080
[Guest]: support price and is set every year by the government so the rice is bought then and the

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:46.520
[Guest]: wheat is bought and then this rice and wheat is sold through the public distribution system

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:52.280
[Guest]: at a very low price now you know public distribution system uh are you know we we've

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:59.960
[Guest]: all commonly seen the ration shops uh you know all across the country so in fact there used to

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.560
[Guest]: be a guzzle by jagjit singh of medicine

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.560
[Guest]: ration

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.960
[Amit Varma]: could be the anthem of the food corporation of india

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.560
[Guest]: so basically you know let's say they i mean i'm just giving you i i mean i don't remember exact

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:25.640
[Guest]: numbers but let's say they sort of buy rice at 15 16 rupees per kg they sell it at two three rupees

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:32.440
[Guest]: per kg so the government needs to make good of this subsidy basically this is the subsidy this

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:40.600
[Guest]: is is so the government makes good of this uh under recovery through food subsidies allocated

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:48.360
[Guest]: in the budget the problem is that the amount allocated towards the food subsidies are never

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:53.400
[Guest]: really enough to sort of compensate food corporation of india or what happens is uh

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.240
[Guest]: like you know what happened last year was that uh the revenues that the government expected to earn

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:05.800
[Guest]: uh did not really come in so the amount allocated towards food subsidy was around 1.7 lakh crore

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.600
[Guest]: and the final number which went towards food subsidy was around 1.01 lakh crore or something

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:17.240
[Guest]: like that so they're borrowing the rest no so basically what is happening is here is that uh

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:28.120
[Guest]: the so so to that extent uh fci wasn't paid around let's say 70 000 crore okay now uh so there are

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:34.920
[Guest]: so there are two things here one is that the government works on cash accounting not like

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.640
[Guest]: companies work on accrual government works on cash now what does this mean this basically means

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:48.360
[Guest]: that it doesn't matter in case of the government whether an expenditure is due or not whether an

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:55.800
[Guest]: expenditure is due if unless it has been paid for i mean unless money has left the accounts of the

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.880
[Guest]: government the uh that is not counted as expenditure okay so even though you need to

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:08.360
[Guest]: pay let's say 70 000 crore more to food corporation of india the fact that you haven't it basically

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.080
[Guest]: means that expenditure has not been in and also what that then means is that your fiscal deficit

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.160
[Guest]: number looks much better than it would which is what i'm saying so because the government

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.160
[Guest]: expenditure hasn't happened so your fiscal deficit number ends up looking

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:29.480
[Guest]: much better now on the flip side fci needs to go out and borrow that money because it needs to

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:36.760
[Guest]: continue to be in operation it's a going concern right now uh why does anyone lend to fci they

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:42.760
[Guest]: lend to fci because fci is an entity of the government of india and governments typically do

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:50.600
[Guest]: not default okay so even though that lending ends up showing on the books of the food corporation

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:56.120
[Guest]: of india it is basically money that is being lent to the government of india now over the years

00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.560
[Guest]: what has happened is i mean i did some uh rough calculation you know some time back i think the

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:11.320
[Guest]: total amount of money that is due to uh fci uh as of march 31st 2019 uh comes to around 160 000

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:17.160
[Guest]: crore so this is so this has not happened over a period of one year it has been happening uh for

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.600
[Guest]: at least uh you know the last eight nine years it's i think it started under p chidambaram

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.600
[Guest]: when he was the finance minister and because of that that number is ballooned now it's ballooned

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:35.320
[Guest]: to a level where uh it's become uncontrollable now other than what is also happening is that

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:41.960
[Guest]: you know fci other than borrowing uh from the market it is borrowing from something called

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:48.360
[Guest]: as the national small savings fund now the money that we all put in the public provident fund and

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:55.480
[Guest]: all the you know different investment schemes run by the post office goes into the nssf national

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:02.520
[Guest]: small savings fund so fci is now borrowing from that fund as well so which is not uh there's one

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.880
[Amit Varma]: borrowing from another government entity because the government hasn't paid it the money to make

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:14.520
[Amit Varma]: its fiscal deficit figures and the taxpayers are on both sides of the equation yeah of course so

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.920
[Guest]: the other interesting thing that that also is happening and it's been happening for a long time

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:24.520
[Guest]: is uh one government company buying another government company and paying the government

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.200
[Amit Varma]: for it and calling it privatization not privatization calling it disinvestment

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:36.600
[Guest]: they call it strategic disinvestment so last year you had ongc buying hpcl for some 36 37 000

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:43.400
[Guest]: crore so that money went from the coffers of ongc and it went to the government and ongc now

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:51.880
[Guest]: owns hpcl in order to execute this deal ongc had to borrow 18 000 crores now obviously ongc is

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:58.280
[Guest]: borrowing here so but this was this borrowing should should actually be on the books of the

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:04.200
[Guest]: government not on the books of ongc so this is another way the government sort of works towards

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.880
[Guest]: bringing down its fiscal deficit so uh i think there's another deal which happened uh i think

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.200
[Amit Varma]: this year so basically ongc will borrow they'll pay the government and the government will present

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.800
[Guest]: it as revenues and it will look good in the fiscal so it's like you know it's basically a

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.920
[Guest]: long time and if i don't know this is the good it's a good example when you know the enron fraud

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:30.120
[Guest]: in the us at the heart of it what was happening was enron was uh making subsidiaries the

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:37.560
[Guest]: subsidiaries were borrowing money and that borrowed money ended up through various shenanigans

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:44.120
[Guest]: ended up as revenue on the books of uh enron so this is a similar operation where ongc borrows

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:52.840
[Guest]: money and buys hpcl gives that money to uh the government so the money that ongc is borrowed

00:22:52.840 --> 00:23:01.560
[Guest]: ends up as revenue on the books of the government uh and yeah and and that's how except in the

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.360
[Amit Varma]: corporate world when enron does it you call it fraud but here it is statecraft and financial

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:11.800
[Amit Varma]: management uh i mean yeah i mean we can't call it fraud but yeah it's not yeah i mean it's it's

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:17.400
[Guest]: basically uh i mean it's not it doesn't so see basically what happens here is you know and this

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:24.600
[Guest]: is an exercise which can go on for eternity right now ongc uh bought hpcl then someone else can

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:32.040
[Amit Varma]: then someone else can buy that yeah and ultimately is taxpayers money and our children suffer though

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:38.280
[Amit Varma]: none of us have children so which is why we don't which is why we don't i mean well we are actually

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:44.440
[Amit Varma]: the only people who give a shit about this but it is none that we know of speak for yourself

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:49.240
[Amit Varma]: uh right so now let's let's uh actually it's a good time to come to another letter

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.520
[Amit Varma]: which i received by postcard which is again a letter for you so now the context for this letter

00:23:54.520 --> 00:24:00.200
[Amit Varma]: is that for the newspaper mint you've done this lovely full-page thing where you created a snakes

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.880
[Amit Varma]: and ladders board and explained the budget through the snakes in the ladder it was not

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:09.400
[Amit Varma]: the budget it was actually the five trillion the five trillion cases yeah yeah cool which i will

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.760
[Amit Varma]: ask you more questions about later uh or maybe why not right after this and so the letter regards

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:20.280
[Amit Varma]: right dear vivek after the budget came out i noted that you did a snakes and ladder feature for a

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:25.400
[Amit Varma]: local newspaper it was very creative and i must commend you however i would like to let you know

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:30.360
[Amit Varma]: that i own all the snakes and ladders in this country so kindly be careful the next time you

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:37.640
[Amit Varma]: try a stunt like this this letter is from amit s in delhi so i won't ask you to respond to this

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:43.640
[Amit Varma]: because it's not a question it's fan mail so it doesn't fit into the ama i guess sort of thing but

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.440
[Amit Varma]: no one of the things that i mean uh and i of course retweeted your tweet on that snakes and

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:53.000
[Amit Varma]: ladder thing and one of the delightful things about it was that you sort of made something

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.720
[Amit Varma]: which was very complex very explicable and fun and you did the same thing in a column you wrote

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.920
[Amit Varma]: about the budget where you brought in basanti viru gabbar and jay kindly explain the connection

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:08.600
[Guest]: of sholay to the budget so when when i had to sort of write this piece uh you know i had sort

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:17.560
[Guest]: of figured out what i wanted to write and but i needed an opening which sort of uh curated some

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:22.200
[Guest]: you know reader interest and also made me sort of a little more excited about writing the piece

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:28.600
[Guest]: so the basic idea was to sort of you know whenever i'm in doubt i sort of go back to 70s 80s hindi

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:34.440
[Guest]: cinema so the basic idea was that you know you have the hero and the heroine's family which has

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:40.680
[Guest]: been captured by the villain and uh you know they are at his den and then uh after some point you

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:45.160
[Guest]: know you have this you know you have a hero breaking in uh through a wall on a motorcycle

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.640
[Guest]: you know when he comes to rescue all of them so this is the basic idea this is what i originally

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:55.160
[Guest]: wanted to write and then it sort of occurred to me that you know why sort of use a general example

00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:03.000
[Guest]: when you can use a specific one so the specific example was sholay where basanti uh you know

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:12.520
[Guest]: basanti and viru are at gabbar's den and basanti is essentially being told very clearly by a

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:18.600
[Guest]: khani chewing gabbar that you know as long as you dance your boyfriend shall live and

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:24.600
[Guest]: and uh viru cannot do anything because his hands are tied right so when you when you're

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:32.680
[Guest]: watching this as an audience you obviously uh are a little worried right but at the back of

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:37.720
[Guest]: because you have seen as many hindi films as you have i mean you know that someone will come to the

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:44.760
[Guest]: rescue and in this case you know that viru's friend jay who's not there will come and sort of

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:51.640
[Guest]: rescue them so this was the basic idea of what i wanted to write now obviously what was the

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:58.840
[Guest]: connection with the with the economy and with the budget and now so if you look at the budget

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:04.760
[Guest]: there is obviously the revenue side with what the government hopes to earn and the expenditure side

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:12.120
[Guest]: on what it wants to spend its money on if you look at the uh revenue side the five biggest

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:18.600
[Guest]: taxes uh you know this time i mean that the government earns money through are basically

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:24.520
[Guest]: corporation tax which is income tax paid by companies then there is income tax which you

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:31.720
[Guest]: and i pay uh then there is uh gst goods and services tax which we pay on a whole host of

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:38.200
[Guest]: things we consume i mean starting from the food that we eat at restaurants so on and so forth

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:43.720
[Guest]: then there is union excise duty and then there is customs duty okay now these are the five main

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.880
[Guest]: taxes if you look at the targets for this financial year the government hopes to earn

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:57.160
[Guest]: 20 percent more than what they had earned during the last financial year okay this is the overall

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:05.000
[Guest]: taxes if you adjust the overall taxes for uh what the central government shares with the

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.240
[Guest]: state governments what remains you know are referred to as revenue receipts and those revenue

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:18.440
[Guest]: receipts are expected to grow 25 percent this year now 20 percent growth and 25 percent growth

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:25.560
[Guest]: in government revenues is uh if i wouldn't call it impossible is very very difficult okay

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:32.040
[Guest]: now why do i say that you have an economy which the government expects to grow by around 12 percent

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:37.320
[Guest]: this is in nominal terms without adjusting for inflation now when the economy is growing by 12

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:44.360
[Guest]: percent you know expecting taxes to grow by 20 or 25 percent is a calculation which does not

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:51.960
[Guest]: work okay but you know again so how how how does the government balance this out okay

00:28:53.160 --> 00:29:01.320
[Guest]: they balance this out by expecting the reserve bank of india to give them a huge dividend okay

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:09.320
[Guest]: now how is all this sort of linked with you know gabbar basanti and sholay and whatnot so obviously

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:17.720
[Guest]: you know in in this uh situation uh you know you have you have basanti and uh you have viru right

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:25.640
[Guest]: so they are basically like the economy and the government okay and uh or you can even call them

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:33.720
[Guest]: the budget whatever now they need to be rescued uh and who will rescue them the rbi will rescue

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:40.520
[Guest]: them so the rbi becomes jay becomes jay right so you have jay viru and you know you have gabbar and

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:49.080
[Guest]: you have uh basanti okay now how will the rbi rescue the government the rbi so basically you

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:57.800
[Guest]: know the rbi uh makes a profit every year from its operations how does rbi make a profit

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:04.600
[Guest]: now uh what is the liability of the rbi the liability of the rbi is the paper money that it

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:12.440
[Guest]: prints and puts out into the market the assets are the international bonds or you know the bonds

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:20.440
[Guest]: that it owns now what happens is that the rbi earns interest on its assets but it does not

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:28.600
[Guest]: pay any interest on its liabilities so it ends up making a humongous amount of profit every year

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:35.480
[Guest]: a lot of so what happens is a significant share of this profit is shared with the government as a

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:45.480
[Guest]: dividend every year and whatever remains goes into uh the capital of the rbi okay and so this

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.200
[Guest]: has been happening for many years and rbi has ended up accumulating a certain amount of capital

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:56.600
[Guest]: now this is a fairly technical issue and uh i mean even my understanding of this doesn't go

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:02.200
[Guest]: you know beyond the fact that the rbi has ended up accumulating a lot of capital so uh you know

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.440
[Guest]: a few years back uh arvind subramaniam who happened to be the chief economic advisor of

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:12.200
[Guest]: the ministry of finance wrote in the economic survey that you know a significant portion of

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:18.600
[Guest]: this accumulated capital that the rbi has can be shared with the government of india since then

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:25.160
[Guest]: there has been a lot of back and forth anybody and everybody who has worked for the rbi does

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:30.600
[Guest]: not like the idea of handing over this money to the government because what they are saying is that

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:36.040
[Guest]: uh all this capital on our books essentially gives us a rock solid balance sheet and it helps

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:41.400
[Guest]: us any point of time where there is any international financial crisis which can spread

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:48.120
[Guest]: to india the government on the other hand uh wants this uh money and it's desperate for money

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:53.720
[Guest]: uh this time around uh so there is a committee which was set up under former rbi governor bimal

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:59.720
[Guest]: jalan uh which has uh not arrived at a decision as yet and i think the news going around is that

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:07.800
[Guest]: they are likely to sort of submit a report sometime this month and uh what they are

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:12.040
[Guest]: essentially saying is that this capital should be shared with the government over a period of time

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:16.200
[Guest]: and that sort of makes a lot of sense the government wants it all at once because

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:23.080
[Guest]: uh they know that uh you know one is that the tax targets are highly optimistic and there is

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.240
[Guest]: no way they're going to go around uh you know earning that kind of money so this time around

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:34.600
[Guest]: i think the the the total amount of money that the government expects as an rbi dividend

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.480
[Guest]: is around 90,000 crore so last year the rbi had given them first given them a dividend of

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:45.400
[Guest]: 40,000 crore and then it had given an interim dividend of 28,000 crore so this 90,000 crore

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:52.280
[Guest]: is what has been budgeted for so in case the revenues don't come through which is uh you know

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:58.680
[Guest]: which is a given i mean you you don't revenues don't jump by 25 percent year on year uh so if

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:03.720
[Amit Varma]: that happens then they'll need more money from the rbi so let me let me kind of summarize my

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:07.000
[Amit Varma]: understanding because this also speaks understanding of this rbi issue because

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.560
[Amit Varma]: this also speaks to a larger conflict that's been brewing over the years which a lot of people have

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:19.400
[Amit Varma]: heard about but may not understand so well basically it's understood that in a democracy

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:24.120
[Amit Varma]: you need certain institutions which have a certain amount of autonomy from the government

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.520
[Amit Varma]: typically the central bank in our case the rbi is supposed to be one of those institutions

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.000
[Amit Varma]: the whole idea of having this cash buffer independent from the government and in the

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.520
[Amit Varma]: rbi's hand is like you said in case there are financial emergencies or whatever then the rbi

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:45.000
[Amit Varma]: can use it responsibly and it's important for the financial system that the rbi retains its

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.640
[Amit Varma]: accountability and retains its independence over decisions like these now what has happened

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:54.280
[Amit Varma]: over the last few years is that there has been pushback from the government which has been

00:33:54.280 --> 00:34:00.680
[Amit Varma]: struggling with its own fiscal imperatives to say give us the money and everyone from the rbi

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:06.920
[Amit Varma]: and this was you know one of the core issues over which um you know rajan fought uh urjit patel

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:12.120
[Amit Varma]: fought uh vidal acharya fought where they were saying that no you know this might be good for

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.120
[Amit Varma]: the government it's not good for the country because we need to keep that money in reserve

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:21.720
[Amit Varma]: for the rbi and eventually what has happened is all those guys are gone and shakti kantha das who

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:27.960
[Amit Varma]: was a bureaucrat uh who enthusiastically carried out and defended demonetization and who will

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:33.560
[Amit Varma]: basically do the government's bidding is now the governor of the rbi so the government actually has

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:39.800
[Guest]: its own man running the rbi which is not the bureaucrats part is so if you look at some of

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:45.240
[Guest]: the best rbi governors i mean everyone from vimal jalan to uh dr y v ready who are very very

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:51.240
[Guest]: highly respected they were also all bureaucrats sure but they were financial this gentleman has

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.840
[Guest]: a slightly spotty record because of his role during whatever i mean so what i'm trying to

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:59.000
[Guest]: say is that it's not just because someone is a bureaucrat he or she cannot make for a good rbi

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.720
[Guest]: governor uh but yes i mean your point is well taken so okay so the other thing is you know

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:08.520
[Guest]: what what happens is uh so this is again you know this is some you know a lot of economics is

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:14.920
[Guest]: simple but this is not i mean this is quite uh convoluted i mean even though even the philosophical

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:18.920
[Amit Varma]: question at the heart of this that should the rbi actually keep this money and not make it

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.880
[Amit Varma]: available to the government if so how much should they give is i think too deeply complex for you

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.080
[Guest]: you are right to have no which is true but there are simple points that one can make

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:32.120
[Guest]: so you know let's say the rbi gives the government a humongous dividend this year

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.760
[Guest]: what happens next year where is the government going to get money from because government

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.640
[Guest]: expenditure never really comes down it only goes up so where is that money going to come

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:47.880
[Guest]: from next year i mean after you've taken money from the rbi the the second thing is so you know

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:54.360
[Guest]: how will the rbi hand this money to the government it has to print this money

00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:01.240
[Guest]: and hand it over to the government okay now uh obviously the simple explanation here is that

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.920
[Guest]: you know when the rbi prints money and hands it over to the government the money supply will go

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:12.680
[Guest]: up and then inflation will happen uh now this is not always true because what the rbi can also do

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:17.640
[Guest]: at the same time is that you know while it can hand over printed money to the government it can

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.720
[Guest]: also suck money out of the market you know the same amount of money can be sucked out of the

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:29.880
[Guest]: market by selling bonds right so uh so that is you know there is this point uh to it as well uh

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:35.160
[Guest]: but but largely you know the point here is that you know what will the government do in the years

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:41.320
[Guest]: to come because you know if it has to take such a huge amount of money from the reserve bank to

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:49.080
[Guest]: keep itself going i mean then there is a basic problem with our fiscal maths i mean our expenditures

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:54.280
[Guest]: our revenues don't justify our expenditures and like you pointed out in your excellent piece which

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:58.120
[Amit Varma]: will be linked from the show notes it's important to remember that in sholay jay did come to the

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:05.400
[Guest]: rescue but he died he died so yeah so which is the last point here in on you know that uh i mean

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.720
[Guest]: even though we didn't want him to die but yeah he he did die so and the irony that basanti was

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:16.840
[Guest]: played by a now bjp mp which is no i mean and viru was also a former bjp mp there you go so

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:21.560
[Guest]: and jay was a former is a former congress mp so this is confused the shit out of me i guess but

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:28.360
[Guest]: basically was a congress mp from alabad very very yeah but now now probably never fought

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:37.720
[Guest]: elections was a good guy and and and and even uh what was her role what was she called in the

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:42.520
[Guest]: movie she was she's also a member of parliament so there you go everyone who acted in sholay

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.640
[Guest]: you know ended up in parliament at some point of time oh this is something i never realized

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:52.040
[Amit Varma]: what is the lesson that we can draw from this we should have worked in yeah you have only written

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.120
[Amit Varma]: about sholay and you're nowhere near parliament of course if these postcards are true they do want

00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:02.360
[Amit Varma]: you to help them run ministries but what's happening here is in the government's thirst

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:08.280
[Amit Varma]: for revenue uh it is uh not only uh you know looking to the rbi to help in the way that you

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:13.160
[Amit Varma]: just described but it's also increasing taxes like andy mukherjee wrote a piece on bloomberg

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:18.600
[Amit Varma]: which has a great headline which is the headline is uh if it moves that's it that's the spirit

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.800
[Amit Varma]: india and in fact i'll quote i guess andy can do that he lives in singapore so you can't do that

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.600
[Amit Varma]: yeah uh and i'll quote from that piece and ask for your comment on it where what he basically

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:35.000
[Amit Varma]: says is quote instead of confronting the sober reality revamping a flawed gst and taking steps

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.560
[Amit Varma]: to pull the economy out of a synchronized slowdown in consumption and private investment

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:44.200
[Amit Varma]: bureaucrats are trying to make up the revenue shortfall by taxing everything that moves

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:49.320
[Guest]: stop quote is the short-sighted yeah of course i mean uh and you know so this is something i've

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:54.360
[Guest]: sort of been writing for a very long time and i mean and then i stopped because i mean you know

00:38:54.360 --> 00:39:00.040
[Guest]: after a point you can't become you know i mean repetitiveness is not good for any any writer

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:05.160
[Guest]: so see the first step towards solving a problem is recognizing that it exists

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:11.400
[Guest]: and uh you know the fact that the narendra modi government till date has not recognized

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:16.840
[Guest]: that demonetization was a disaster and we are paying we're still paying uh for the you know

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:22.120
[Guest]: the cost of demonetization so forget i mean let's forget demonetization okay i mean as a government

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.960
[Guest]: if you've done something and it hasn't worked out you cannot really come out and say you know

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:31.720
[Guest]: that was a mistake points well taken but at the same time you know you need to recognize that

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:38.440
[Guest]: you need to recognize that there is a there is a marked slowdown the economy is in trouble

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:45.960
[Guest]: and you need to sort of take steps towards uh you know setting that right and the good part

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:53.320
[Guest]: was that this was the first budget of a five-year term the opposition more or less is not there in

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:58.520
[Guest]: fact you know one point that i was uh i i i was telling someone the other day was that uh if you

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:05.320
[Guest]: if you heard the budget speech this time it was the quietest budget speech that at least i have

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:10.120
[Guest]: seen you know from whatever i have seen normally when a finance minister is speaking you know you

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:14.200
[Guest]: will have a cat call you know some mp shouting somewhere or in between they'll get noisy

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:20.360
[Guest]: but this time there was just no noise i mean the minister stood up and she spoke for two

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:26.520
[Guest]: hour five minutes two hour ten minutes and she wasn't stopped at any point of time some would

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:32.040
[Amit Varma]: argue that this shows how deeply indian culture respects women no no i don't know indian culture

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:41.480
[Guest]: doesn't respect women so well said i will visit you and you also wrote a piece on income taxes

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.480
[Amit Varma]: right obviously one of the taxes they've put is they've raised the maximum income tax on

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.480
[Amit Varma]: you know people earning more than two crores five crores blah blah it's all gone up you in fact

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:55.080
[Amit Varma]: cited you know indira gandhi in your pieces you know i mean the max rate in her time was 97 percent

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:59.720
[Guest]: and there's this great story and and i wanted to put that into the piece but it sort of

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:09.960
[Guest]: became too lengthy so this is from the actor pran's official biography and the biography is

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.600
[Guest]: called and pran because i mean it's obvious all the movies when which he used to star in

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:19.400
[Guest]: his name used to be in the end now and pran i mean it's a very good name as far as biography

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:25.640
[Guest]: is good it's a fantastic name and it's been written by this gentleman called bunny ruben

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:30.200
[Guest]: who used to be one of the he was a big pr guy was original pr guys in bollywood

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:36.120
[Guest]: in the hindi film industry not bollywood sorry so one of the stories in the book is about how

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:45.080
[Guest]: raj kapoor was almost broke after making mera naam joker okay and he had to sell a part of his

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:52.280
[Guest]: studio and so then he decided to make this movie called bobby for the new generation and

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:58.920
[Guest]: so bobby was supposed to be this low budget uh quickie as they call it in you know in in the

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:05.240
[Guest]: film parlance so obviously pran sort of pran was there in the movie and knowing that you know this

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:11.560
[Guest]: guy is going through a tough time he did not charge for the movie i mean or so the biography

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:18.280
[Guest]: says and so anyway the movie sort of was released and it became a huge hit so apparently after the

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:25.480
[Guest]: movie became a huge hit uh raj kapoor paid pran one lakh rupees and pran was like

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:39.880
[Guest]: so the marginal rate of tax in the early 70s was 97.75 percent okay and uh in night i think it was

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:47.080
[Guest]: in the budget of 1974-75 where yashwant raut sawan who was then the finance minister said that

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:52.440
[Guest]: something to the effect and i'm paraphrasing here that the high tax rate is essentially leading to

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.000
[Guest]: you know situation where the black economy is getting bigger so given that we are reducing

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.680
[Guest]: the tax rate so the tax rate was reduced from 97.75 percent to 75 percent

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:12.600
[Guest]: so anyway so the point is that india has such a huge black economy primarily because over the

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:21.160
[Guest]: years we've wanted to tax the high income earners at high tax rates and the argument is the old one

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:26.520
[Guest]: that of social equity where people who earn more should be paying more taxes because they are you

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:33.320
[Guest]: know blah blah blah now all this makes immense sense in you know or it doesn't make sense i mean

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:37.480
[Amit Varma]: that is a different argument for a different day it's a scene it's not the unseen i mean the unseen

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:43.800
[Amit Varma]: of high tax rates would really be two things one is that wherever people who are earning that much

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:49.000
[Amit Varma]: are able to leave they leave so for example singapore has low tax rates if you're in

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.640
[Amit Varma]: india and you're earning five crores a year you'll just go somewhere where the tax is lower

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:58.680
[Amit Varma]: so it's a flight of labor and it's a brain drain as it were and the other effect is that a lot you

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:04.200
[Amit Varma]: have a larger black market and the point is anyone who can do juga to save taxes i mean saving taxes

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:10.280
[Amit Varma]: was practically a core skill back in the 70s and 80s and anyone who can do the juga to save

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:16.040
[Amit Varma]: the taxes which will be the ambani's and the adani's will do so and it's it's so i i know so

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:20.360
[Guest]: my uh i mean yes i mean i agree with what you're saying but what what i wanted to say was that

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:29.160
[Guest]: uh all this makes sense in a country where a significant number of rich people are actually

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:34.520
[Guest]: paying taxes okay now if you if you look at the indian economy and there are numbers for this it's

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:41.480
[Guest]: not like you know uh this is true for assessment years 2017-18 which is financial year 16-17

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:50.360
[Guest]: there were 81,344 people who had a gross total income of more than a crore gross not even

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:58.440
[Guest]: taxable okay 81,344 in a country of 130 crore and i'd like to assure our listeners that neither

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:03.880
[Guest]: vivek nor i were part of this i mean i wish nowhere near so otherwise i wouldn't have been

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:12.520
[Guest]: doing this podcast i would have been you know relaxing somewhere anyway so the point is 81,344

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:19.880
[Guest]: people have a declare a gross income of more than a crore of this around 51 percent are the salary

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:28.040
[Guest]: poor guys don't have any option they have to pay tax right so in the budget uh you know uh people

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:34.680
[Guest]: uh people who earn between two crore and five crore now have to pay tax at the rate of the

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:42.040
[Guest]: highest marginal rate is 39 percent and about five crore the rate is 42.74 percent okay now the point

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:49.560
[Guest]: is key you know and we are talking about 81,344 people above a crore so not even two no so the

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:54.600
[Guest]: two crore number will probably be one fourth or whatever i mean it will probably be 30,000 or

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:59.960
[Guest]: something like that right not even that it will be lower than that so where are the numbers you

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:06.760
[Guest]: know you should first look at expanding the tax base rather than you know trying to tax the shit

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:13.480
[Amit Varma]: out of people who are already there and like you pointed out maybe in the extreme short term in the

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:20.280
[Guest]: next financial year you might increase the taxes coming but overall it will not i mean it any

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:25.000
[Guest]: anyone say it's also a matter of effort right i mean when you see that any extra effort leading

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.760
[Guest]: to any extra income uh a bulk of it if it goes to the government i mean why would you want to

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:37.480
[Guest]: put in that effort right so that that part is always uh true so i mean so the thing is you

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:44.120
[Guest]: know in a country like india where most people are a large population is still not paying taxes

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:51.880
[Guest]: taxes should remain moderate i think the 30 top tax rate which we we've been following since 97 98

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:57.960
[Guest]: is perfectly fine and this just discourages uh you know people from declaring income also see

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:03.320
[Guest]: what also happens is that you know people who earn a lot of money like you know the two crores

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:08.680
[Guest]: and the five crores of the world they don't necessarily make this money through salaried

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:14.760
[Guest]: income right i mean a lot of this money is earned through dividend uh tax rates there are lower a

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:20.520
[Guest]: lot of money of this money is made through capital gains tax rates there are lower so i mean ultimately

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:27.000
[Guest]: you know you are ending up hitting the salaried guy who has no choice i mean no and the other

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.480
[Amit Varma]: point i keep making is that yeah okay we need a government to protect our rights so we need some

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:36.680
[Amit Varma]: taxes and that's fair enough but if you actually think about it taxation amounts to part-time

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:41.640
[Amit Varma]: slavery for example what does it mean if you pay 40 percent of your income every year in tax it

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:46.360
[Amit Varma]: means that for 40 percent of the year you are basically working for the government so from

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.600
[Amit Varma]: january to april or may or whatever it is you are working for the government you start earning

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:56.440
[Amit Varma]: after that which is a situation which uh you know you don't mind doing some slavery for the

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:01.080
[Amit Varma]: government it is basically part-time slavery as long as you're you're seeing that the government

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:05.480
[Amit Varma]: the state is doing what it's supposed to do but there is no rule of law there is no infrastructure

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:10.440
[Amit Varma]: all the things that the state is supposed to do it doesn't do and on top of that uh there is

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:16.280
[Guest]: this bullshit of having the taxes you see that video of uh of the scooter going into an open

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:22.360
[Amit Varma]: storm drain there you go you work from you you work from jan to april as a slave for the

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.200
[Amit Varma]: government and then your scooter goes into a storm drain and you think damn it i'm not coming

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:32.520
[Guest]: well they were able to pull it out so but there are four people who you you get what i'm saying

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.680
[Amit Varma]: so uh we'll have to go in for a break now and we'll continue after the break but before that

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:43.000
[Amit Varma]: the final postcard i received which is for me which is for me no no wait okay uh dear amit i

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.280

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:15.240
[Amit Varma]: and we've been inundated with responses because vivek kaul i have realized in the last 18 hours

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:21.160
[Guest]: is basically the shahrukh khan of economics dude like following like like you are the govinda

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:26.760
[Guest]: of podcasts you know podcaster number one after hero number one coolie number one bv number one

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.240
[Amit Varma]: yeah man seriously

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.240
[Amit Varma]: seriously

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:42.280
[Amit Varma]: so uh let's just moving on to your questions and one of the things that you promised your many

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:47.800
[Amit Varma]: fans many many fans is that you will give autographed copies of your book out uh to

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.880
[Amit Varma]: whoever asks the most interesting not not interesting most interesting the most interesting

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:57.160
[Amit Varma]: question because all the questions are interesting and there are so many of them we couldn't possibly

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:03.400
[Guest]: we'll go broke paying courier charges we'll go yeah so given that you know both of us don't come

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:12.280
[Amit Varma]: in the 43 tax bracket yeah so we have selected uh or even lower tax brackets for that matter

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:18.280
[Amit Varma]: you embarrass correct uh so uh and we have so many questions we won't by the way be asking all

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:22.120
[Amit Varma]: questions it's not possible maybe someday we should just do a special episode or have a separate

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:27.800
[Amit Varma]: podcast where vivek answers uh questions a podcast called ask vivek which would be quite

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:35.080
[Amit Varma]: interesting use your vivek to ask yeah but we're kind of rambling now to get on to the winning

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:42.280
[Amit Varma]: question straight away the winning question is by soumit mishra who tweets at the crooked skull

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:49.000
[Amit Varma]: all one word and the question is this quote this question is not exactly on the budget but related

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.720
[Amit Varma]: to economic survey released a day earlier the document talks a lot about creating a virtuous

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:59.480
[Amit Varma]: cycle of investment savings and exports while completely undermining the domestic consumption

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:05.000
[Amit Varma]: part how wise a strategy is it to actually envisage a five trillion economy on the back

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:11.000
[Amit Varma]: of exports especially when a there is an uncertain global market with anti-globalization mode across

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:16.680
[Amit Varma]: europe and us and b the indian manufacturing sector is yet to show us that it can compete

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:23.080
[Guest]: with china stop quote okay so you know i can see where the economic survey uh is coming from

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:31.320
[Guest]: and if you look at the uh the history of economic growth uh and if you look at the history of

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:37.240
[Guest]: economic growth over the last 50 60 years countries which have gone from being developing

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:45.000
[Guest]: countries to becoming developed countries have started with uh uh you know low-end exports

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:52.360
[Guest]: you know things like toys and agriculture exports and leather exports and so on and so forth i mean

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:59.480
[Guest]: and this is true across you know be it china be it southeast asia be it taiwan even when the us

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:05.640
[Guest]: was a developing country and when they exported stuff to the united kingdom of great britain

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:12.360
[Guest]: this is how all development starts so to that extent uh you know there is a formula

00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:18.040
[Guest]: for the entire thing and the economic surveys obviously going with that formula and you really

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:25.000
[Guest]: cannot sort of blame them not to you know not to be going with it because you know the global market

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.600
[Guest]: clearly is much much much bigger than the indian market and you would rather have you know some

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:38.040
[Guest]: portion of the overall bigger pie right now to the question of why you know uh in indian

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:43.400
[Guest]: in indian manufacturers competing globally uh you know which is true you know you know our

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:50.680
[Guest]: exports uh are not productive enough uh to be competing globally and you know i mean we all

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:58.600
[Guest]: know examples of uh how uh you know the lakshmi and ganesh which you know who we worship during

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:05.080
[Guest]: diwali they are also now made in china uh we know the example of holy colors and pichkari is being

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:13.160
[Guest]: made in china so if you know we are not able to make even this basic stuff uh at a good competitive

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:18.520
[Guest]: price the latest example that i've heard of and which is very interesting is that now we are

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:29.560
[Guest]: importing uh agarbattis from vietnam and that's primarily because vietnam grows a lot of bamboo

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:34.760
[Guest]: so obviously someone you know some industrialists or some entrepreneur from vietnam has come to

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:40.680
[Guest]: india and studied the market and that's how it's all started the other thing is if you look at our

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:48.360
[Guest]: manufacturing firms and this is very something very peculiar to india they either employ uh a

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:56.040
[Guest]: bulk of them i mean uh they either employ less than 50 people or they employ more than 250 people

00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:04.760
[Guest]: 150 people there is a huge gap in the middle okay and it's these middle firms who actually

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:12.360
[Guest]: create jobs so basically what what seems to be happening is that once a firm reaches a certain

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:20.760
[Guest]: size let's say it employs around 40 45 47 people it doesn't want to grow beyond that size because

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:26.840
[Guest]: you know the the uh the rules and the regulations that it has to follow once it sort of grows

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:33.080
[Guest]: beyond uh 50 people are so uh humongous and so problematic that it doesn't make sense

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:38.600
[Amit Varma]: for it to go beyond that in some cases 20 people so what like it typically happens and you know you

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:43.640
[Amit Varma]: and i have been going on about this forever is that where we went wrong in the last few decades

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:49.080
[Amit Varma]: is that look india's advantage if you're looking back 30 years 40 years was cheap labor we should

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:53.480
[Amit Varma]: have been the manufacturing superpower that china was but the reason we couldn't do that

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:57.880
[Amit Varma]: was because our manufacturing units could never scale we had bad labor laws which this

00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:04.760
[Amit Varma]: incentivized companies scaling beyond a certain point uh you know with some laws the number is 20

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:09.560
[Amit Varma]: that the cost becomes so high if you go past 20 that what companies would do is instead of using

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:13.880
[Amit Varma]: the advantages of scale they would set up separate units and there would be many many units which

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:19.160
[Amit Varma]: have 20 20 people and therefore not using economies of scale and not being able to scale up

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:25.640
[Amit Varma]: and grow to the middle level and from there to the big level uh the bigger levels and this is

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:31.800
[Amit Varma]: sort of one of the key reforms that people have been talking about from donkey's years this is

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:36.200
[Amit Varma]: a labor law reforms are very very essential to get the manufacturing sector growing

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:44.520
[Amit Varma]: and this is something that in fact uh the modi um rhetoric in 2014 actually from so yeah so i'll

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:49.800
[Guest]: just interject here so you know one of the things that nirmala sitaraman uh talked about in the

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:56.520
[Guest]: budget was the fact that they are trying to reduce the number of labor laws so if if you look at uh

00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:02.280
[Guest]: you know india as a whole the central government has around 44 labor laws and nobody is really

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:07.480
[Guest]: sure as to how many labor laws uh you know state governments have but amit mitra who's now the

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:13.640
[Guest]: minister of finance in the west bengal government and used to be a big business lobbyist once upon

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:20.040
[Guest]: a time estimates that the number varies anywhere between 150 to 200. so now what uh the the

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:26.200
[Guest]: government uh has has sort of said is that they'll try reducing these laws to basically four codes

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:32.440
[Guest]: now this is something that was that was tried even back in 2015 and you know the labor union

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:38.040
[Guest]: sort of opposed it and then you know that was the last we heard of it now this proposal has been

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:43.400
[Guest]: uh sort of revised and it let's see as to how it goes uh now so getting back to what i was trying

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:48.760
[Guest]: to say you know one of the things that that's that's happening globally is that china now is

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:54.680
[Guest]: sort of moving up the uh export value chain so the it doesn't want to do low-end exports because

00:58:54.680 --> 00:59:00.920
[Guest]: the labor now there is uh expensive and there is no point in china now doing low-end exports

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:07.320
[Guest]: so those exports so this is something that has been identified i mean the arvin subramaniam uh

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:14.440
[Guest]: wrote quite a lot about it and uh so the idea was that because china is not doing this a lot of this

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:19.720
[Guest]: could move to india but what is happening is that a lot of it is moving to bangladesh and vietnam

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:27.720
[Guest]: so we've sort of uh lost an opportunity there in fact if you look at uh india's low-end exports

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:33.080
[Guest]: our engineering exports have been growing but our low-end exports which actually uh you know

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:41.640
[Guest]: as i said create jobs uh you know stuff like leather uh manufacturing or agri exports and

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:46.440
[Guest]: so on and so forth uh they have not been growing or they've been growing at a very very

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:53.000
[Guest]: low pace now you know to say that we are not able to compete and we will not be able to compete is

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.800
[Guest]: one thing but what else do you do i mean see consumption is fine you know but how does

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.480
[Guest]: consumption work at the end of the day i mean you know i'll give you a very simple example

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:08.360
[Guest]: let's say there is an area on the outskirts of a city a new factory comes and establishes

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:15.240
[Guest]: itself there no factory creates jobs housing societies come around the factory there are

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:20.680
[Guest]: there are shops which open up in and around the factory grocery shops you have uh you know

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:27.560
[Guest]: everything you know from pan walas to cigarette walas to subzi walas to so this is how you know

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:33.560
[Guest]: consumption sort of spreads now you have to have something at the heart of it which encourages

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:38.760
[Guest]: that consumption okay so you know many years back i i sort of read this great example and you know

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:46.040
[Guest]: uh i can't recall where as to how every a single it job a proper it job in bangalore

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:51.320
[Guest]: created six other jobs around it okay and it's it's very it's it's straightforward because

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:57.240
[Guest]: you know you need buses to take these it guys from office and drop them back uh then you need

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:02.440
[Guest]: homes to house them then you need these guys have long working hours so then you need cooks

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:08.680
[Guest]: you need maids you need so on and so forth a lot of them go to the us make money in dollars come

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:16.200
[Guest]: back and spend that money in india so ultimately for consumption to happen you know investment

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:22.040
[Guest]: has to happen you know consumption cannot keep driving uh up on its own unless there is some

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:28.440
[Guest]: investment happening somewhere and if consumption keeps you know going up on its own then ultimately

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:33.080
[Guest]: then ultimately you will end up with a huge retail bubble i mean it's it's a no-brainer i mean look

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:40.040
[Guest]: at what has happened in the western world what has happened in the western world is that per capita

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:45.720
[Guest]: incomes have stagnated median incomes have been stagnating since the 70s now obviously you know

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:52.120
[Guest]: for politicians the easy way out was to offer loans at low interest rates and then keep the

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:59.160
[Guest]: consumption going so once and and all that sort of added together and came uh to the financial

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:05.560
[Guest]: crisis of uh 2008 so consumption cannot uh happen on its own you know when people say

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:10.360
[Guest]: that india is a consumption driven economy i think it's it's it's a very stupid thing to say

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:15.160
[Guest]: no i shouldn't be proud of it you know people make statements like 50 percent of our economy

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:20.920
[Amit Varma]: is services it's not something to be proud of and in a sense the 50 percent of our economy being

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.920
[Amit Varma]: services is actually a reflection of something that's deeply gone wrong i'll go back to

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:29.800
[Amit Varma]: manufacturing for a bit just to sort of illustrate that it's not just about one sector it's about the

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:34.600
[Amit Varma]: whole economy for example we know we are in the middle of an agricultural crisis now one of the

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:38.280
[Amit Varma]: reasons for the crisis and i have had various episodes on agriculture which will be linked

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:43.240
[Amit Varma]: from the show notes but one of the both illustrations and reasons for it is that in

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:49.080
[Amit Varma]: india more than 50 percent of the people depend on agriculture for a living while in all developed

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:53.320
[Amit Varma]: countries the number used to be around that much but now it's much less for example in the u.s i

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:58.200
[Amit Varma]: think it's about four percent in europe it's in single figure percentages we are more than 50

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.840
[Amit Varma]: percent now typically what would happen is that your agricultural productivity would go up and

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:07.640
[Amit Varma]: people would move out of agriculture into manufacturing that's kind of what you would

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.880
[Amit Varma]: expect especially in india where we have the advantage of cheap labor now we have a number

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:18.200
[Amit Varma]: of laws which tie people to agriculture for various reasons which again you can check out

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:23.880
[Amit Varma]: in those episodes and plus at the same time we have a bunch of laws which constrain manufacturing

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:28.280
[Amit Varma]: so even if people were to be able to get out of agriculture where are the jobs for them where are

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:33.800
[Amit Varma]: the manufacturing jobs and it seems that we might you know that boat might well have sailed because

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:42.200
[Amit Varma]: with the rise of automation and ai it's now hard to say that even with uh you know even if these

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:46.520
[Amit Varma]: labor laws were to be reformed would we ever be a manufacturer that's the question that's there

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:51.960
[Guest]: but see as as chief economic advisor of a country you really cannot say it's not possible right of

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:56.520
[Amit Varma]: course i mean he's got he has to be positive right so you can't really blame him for saying

01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:01.880
[Guest]: what he does i think see what has happened is if you know if you read uh the the economic surveys

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:07.560
[Guest]: of the last 10 years i think all of them make immense sense it's just that the politicians

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:13.640
[Guest]: are not the ones reading it i mean you and i are that doesn't help so yeah and so i just wanted to

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:19.480
[Guest]: make another point on you know this service is being 50 of our economy business and you know

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:25.480
[Guest]: some of the services i mean you look at how big teaching classes are you know in mumbai we call

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:31.160
[Guest]: them teaching classes right i mean why should there be a business like that i find it amazing

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:36.360
[Guest]: that you know students first go to school and college and then go to these classes to attend

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:40.440
[Guest]: classes all over again so what are the teachers doing in school and college basically state

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:47.000
[Guest]: failure leading to the market having to step in but it's it's all i mean look at how big i mean

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.920
[Guest]: it's not so true anymore but once upon a time how how big the inverter business used to be in

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:57.400
[Guest]: you know i mean inverters are not services but what i'm saying is that a lot of a lot of state

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:01.240
[Amit Varma]: failure is having to be covered up by the market which is a waste of resources and a waste of

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:05.800
[Amit Varma]: energy and entrepreneurship but you're just having to do it because the state after taking

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:11.960
[Amit Varma]: our taxes and making us work free from doesn't really jan to april is failing us so i think so

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.800
[Guest]: you know what i mean i don't know if i've answered the question because we sort of went round and

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:21.880
[Guest]: round but what what i'm basically trying to say is that unless there is investment in the economy

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.800
[Guest]: how will consumption ever happen beyond a point because if consumption is happening and it's

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:31.240
[Guest]: growing without investment i mean then it's only because the banks and you know in the financial

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:37.640
[Guest]: institutions are lending money and they're lending money to anyone and everyone yes yeah

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:44.520
[Amit Varma]: next question something more cheerful this is from sandipan mitra on twitter who asks what will

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:49.400
[Amit Varma]: be the most appropriate hindi song to describe the budget and i insist you sing it no i can't

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:54.280
[Guest]: sing it oh that was he said yeah so this is something i this is not my original thought i i

01:05:54.280 --> 01:06:02.280
[Guest]: sort of i saw it on twitter a journalist a hindustan time journalist called roshan and he

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:09.480
[Guest]: said there's this movie uh called papa kehte hain which starred jugal hansraj and uh and someone

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:16.760
[Guest]: called mayuri kango and the song was ye jo thode se hai paise kharch inko karu mein kaise

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:24.440
[Guest]: so which is finally the uh you know something that uh miss sitaraman was battling with uh this

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:30.520
[Amit Varma]: time and doubly poignant given where the careers of jugal hansraj and mayuri kango went yeah so

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:36.520
[Guest]: in fact the the story there's this huge story uh about jugal hansraj the kuch kuch hota hai song

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:45.000
[Guest]: was basically his tune oh he gave it to aditya chopra who gave it to uh karan johar it was his

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:52.520
[Guest]: tune he also made this uh animated uh movie called roadside room which was very good the

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:58.520
[Guest]: problem was it was marketed for kids it's just that the humor was for you know for for the for

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:04.920
[Guest]: adults so that sort of went clearly you enjoyed the film yeah it was quite nice so we shall now

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:09.640
[Amit Varma]: go on to our next question and apologies if i pronounce the name wrong shreyas banthal pad

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:16.120
[Amit Varma]: and this question is ndtv is reporting a whole of 1.7 lakh crores in budget is this real sounds

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:23.240
[Amit Varma]: pretty insane okay p.s the crores auto-corrected to cries so a whole of 1.7 lakh cries would also be

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:28.120
[Amit Varma]: interesting but as he points out it's an appropriate metaphor for where we are economy

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:35.320
[Guest]: wise this is a quite a uh it's a complicated thing to sort of uh you have a tweet thread on

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:39.720
[Guest]: it which i will link from the show that's okay i'll try it i'll try explaining it and i also have

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:48.760
[Guest]: a piece in the mint on thursday uh july 11th we are recording this on july july 10th right

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:55.160
[Guest]: so basically again you know where does this whole come from there is something uh in in

01:07:55.160 --> 01:08:01.320
[Guest]: the government budget uh there is something known as uh revenue receipts okay now what are revenue

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:11.000
[Guest]: receipts revenue receipts are essentially uh taxes that the government earns uh you subtract

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:19.960
[Guest]: the state government's share from that and to that you add the non-tax revenue of the government

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:24.920
[Guest]: which is basically you know the dividend that the public sector enterprises give the dividend that

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:30.920
[Guest]: uh financial institutions the dividend that rbi gives to the government so basically you start

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:35.640
[Guest]: with the taxes you know the five taxes that we the five major taxes and then there are these small

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:41.880
[Guest]: taxes also these five major taxes from that you deduct the the money that goes to the state

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:47.320
[Guest]: governments and to that you add the non-tax revenue of the government so these are revenue receipts to

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:57.640
[Guest]: be very very simple now the if you look at the uh economic survey of of the government it puts the

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:10.440
[Guest]: revenue receipts at uh 15.6 lakh crore okay if you look at the budget it puts the revenue receipts

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:19.960
[Guest]: at 17.3 lakh crore so the question is where did you know the 1.7 lakh crore difference you know

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:24.680
[Guest]: go now where did that money disappear i mean this is how people have been spinning it on

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:32.520
[Guest]: twitter i mean the money did not disappear uh it's just that uh the the economic survey

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:39.720
[Guest]: and the budget use different estimates of the revenue receipts so basically what happens is

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:47.720
[Guest]: when the budget is presented for a year the government makes estimates of the amount of

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:54.360
[Guest]: money it expects to earn and the amount of money it expects to spend so these estimates are known

01:09:54.360 --> 01:10:01.320
[Guest]: as budget estimates okay when the next budget is presented the government again gives a record of

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.320
[Guest]: the you know amount of money it expects to earn and the amount of money it expects to

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:11.400
[Guest]: spend so these are revised estimates okay so like let's say 2000 let's let's take an example of a

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:19.320
[Guest]: financial year and do it so 2018-19 in february 2018 arun jaitley presented the budget and he

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:26.600
[Guest]: presented the budget for 18-19 which is the period between april 2018 and march 2019 okay so what the

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:34.600
[Guest]: so what the numbers there are were referred to as budget estimates in february 2019 piyush goel

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:43.560
[Guest]: presented the interim budget okay now the numbers now for 2018-19 that he has are different from

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:49.960
[Guest]: the numbers that jaitley presented right uh so these numbers are known as revised estimates

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:58.120
[Guest]: okay so the revised estimate uh in the february 2019 interim budget for revenue receipts

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:06.680
[Guest]: was 17.3 lakh crore okay these are revised estimates now what happens what is peculiar

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:12.440
[Guest]: to this year is that we have an interim budget and then we have a final budget we have an interim

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:18.040
[Guest]: budget because the government is completing five years in office and it cannot offer a full year's

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:24.760
[Guest]: budget because that is the next government's prerogative july 5th nirmala sita raman presents

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:33.320
[Guest]: the final budget now what has happened is that meanwhile there is this agency of the government

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:39.720
[Guest]: called the controller general of accounts which puts out a month on month record of

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:47.080
[Guest]: you know how much the government earns and how much the government spends so on may 31st 2019

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:55.640
[Guest]: it put out the numbers for 2018-19 and as per that agency the revenue receipts

01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:09.160
[Guest]: of the government for 2018-19 were 15.6 lakh crore okay the economic survey used this estimate

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:14.200
[Guest]: put out by the controller general of accounts this is known as a provisional estimate okay

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:19.480
[Guest]: so if you have still not you know if you're not confused by now so the economic survey put out

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:26.600
[Guest]: the controller general of accounts number which was 15.6 lakh crore nirmala sita raman's budget

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:35.800
[Guest]: stuck to the revised estimate of 17.3 lakh crore so uh now the the the controller general of

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:44.360
[Guest]: accounts number given that it was published in may is more accurate than the number which was

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:51.560
[Guest]: the revised estimate published in the interim budget sita raman used the revised estimate of

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:57.960
[Guest]: 17.3 lakh crore and supermaniam used the provisional estimate which is 15.6 lakh crore and

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:04.680
[Guest]: hence the difference of 1.7 lakh now what is happening here now uh if you look at uh the

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:12.280
[Guest]: previous uh a few times when an interim budget was presented one uh the last one was in 2014

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:19.240
[Guest]: and the one before that was in 2009 so to rest all conspiracy theories to you know to put all

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:25.720
[Guest]: conspiracy theories to rest the typically when a full budget is presented after an interim budget

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:30.920
[Guest]: the government uses a revised estimate and not a full estimate not a provisional estimate

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:36.200
[Guest]: now what happened was that this time around the difference between the revised estimate

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:42.120
[Guest]: and the provisional estimate was huge the difference was 1.7 lakh crore whereas if you

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:46.680
[Guest]: look at i mean i looked at the previous two times and the difference between those two estimates

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:53.480
[Guest]: was not very big so because the difference was 1.7 lakh crore uh which is why people sort of

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:59.160
[Guest]: noticed it okay now what does this do in the overall scheme of things is very interesting

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:06.680
[Guest]: interesting the revised revenue estimate is 17.3 lakh crore the next the next year's revenue

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:12.440
[Guest]: receipts are expected to be around 19.6 lakh crore or something like that so that is a jump of 13

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:18.520
[Guest]: percent which is doable but then the 17.3 lakh crore is not the real number it's just the number

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:22.600
[Guest]: that the government has put into the budget because that's the you know that's convention

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:27.960
[Guest]: that we follow so if you put in the real number of 15.63 lakh crore the revenue receipts now need

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:34.760
[Guest]: to jump by 25.6 percent or something like that my god so which is where the problem is and which

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.960
[Guest]: is where if we sort of go back to the rbi point which is why the government expects the rbi to

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:45.400
[Guest]: give a huge dividend so because you're not accounting for things properly and and this is

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.960
[Guest]: not i mean the modi government is not to be blamed for this they are just following what has always

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:55.080
[Guest]: been done but this is something that needs to be corrected because you know you can't have you

01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:00.440
[Guest]: know revenue receipts you want to earn you know 25 percent more but you're reporting only you know

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:09.720
[Guest]: 13 percent more so so this is a major hole in the way the budget is sort of crafted it's just that

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:14.120
[Guest]: it never mattered before this so probably people didn't bother so this time around

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:20.680
[Amit Varma]: it's a large number and people would have people but there is no conspiracy theory yeah no one's

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:25.160
[Amit Varma]: taken this money out in suit it's not like someone's like run off with the money it's just

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.600
[Guest]: that the accounting how many suitcases would you need is different i have no idea you would have

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:34.680
[Guest]: to ask harshad metha so but he's long gone yeah he was the suitcase yeah man these days why do

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:39.240
[Amit Varma]: you want to do suitcase you just do bitcoins so that's also true but if you took it in suitcases

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.800
[Amit Varma]: it would give a boost to the suitcase industry a manufacturing problems could be solved then i

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:49.400
[Guest]: think the simplest way is to just do gold and i mean a simplest way would be to do diamonds but

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:53.720
[Guest]: diamonds the problem is always a valuation no one gives you the same valuation gold is gold you know

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:58.280
[Amit Varma]: if it is gold you'll get the the rate for that day no more jokes from me in this episode you're

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:04.840
[Amit Varma]: taking it too seriously let's move on to the next question from sai krishna vadlamuri uh and i like

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:09.880
[Amit Varma]: this question which is is it fair for central governments to collect cesses which they don't

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:14.840
[Amit Varma]: have to share with state governments doesn't it affect the federal nature of the country it's a

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:21.080
[Guest]: great question so basically what has happened is that and it's this is you know in in the last

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:26.760
[Guest]: two three years the government has sort of been imposing more and more uh cesses now what what is

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:34.520
[Guest]: the difference between a cess and a tax okay a tax is basically uh something we so uh let's say

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:41.560
[Guest]: there is 20 income tax and then there is a 10 uh cess on that tax so which basically translates

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:49.160
[Guest]: into a two percent tax okay now what happens is the when the union government collects taxes

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:54.120
[Guest]: the taxes need to be shared with the state governments whereas when it collects a cess

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:59.640
[Guest]: it doesn't have to share that with the state government it can keep it for itself which is

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:04.360
[Guest]: why what has been happening is in the last few years is that there have you know there has been

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:09.240
[Guest]: an increase in the number of cesses i mean if you look at you know this year also there was some

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:14.600
[Guest]: cess which has been introduced on petrol one rupee per liter what this essentially does is

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:19.080
[Guest]: that every time a new cess is introduced money goes directly into the coffers of the central

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:23.880
[Guest]: government it's not shared with the state government now this i think is wrong primarily

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:30.680
[Guest]: because you know ultimately uh the the taxes are basically coming from the states right i mean it

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.240
[Guest]: might be an income tax but you know there's nothing like a central area i mean right i mean

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:41.480
[Guest]: there are various states of where people earn and then they pay taxes so any tax or cess sort of

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:47.320
[Guest]: thing has to be should be shared so i just did some rough calculation and i think the proportion

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:56.200
[Guest]: of cess in the government uh has increased from some 15 16 percent to close to 30 percent so yes

01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:03.320
[Guest]: i mean so this goes against the entire spirit of fiscal federalism and so on and so forth and you

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:08.040
[Guest]: know so this is so there's another point i wanted to make here is that so there are a lot of these

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:13.800
[Guest]: arguments which which happen on how you know the south pays more tax or like you know people in

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:18.920
[Guest]: mumbai love to say this we pay maximum income tax we shouldn't be saying these things primarily

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:24.360
[Guest]: because mumbai pays maximum income tax because the companies are headquartered in mumbai

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:30.760
[Guest]: the money that they are earning is spread all across india right so you cannot really say that

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.560
[Guest]: you know mumbai is paying in you know that is just an accounting entry or for that matter that

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:40.680
[Guest]: delhi pays the second most most tax or for that matter that bangalore you know karnataka pays a

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.920
[Guest]: lot of income tax so karnataka pays a lot of income tax because the it companies happen to be

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:50.440
[Guest]: based there and not which is also a lot of it is a luck of a draw it's not like

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.360
[Guest]: you know there was infrastructure in bangalore waiting for it companies to also point out the

01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:02.840
[Amit Varma]: irony here that you know when modiji was a chief minister he would talk a lot of federalism like

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.480
[Amit Varma]: 2014 there was a talk of the town that we'll have increased federalism and blah blah blah

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:11.000
[Amit Varma]: but now that the incentives have changed and he's running the central government

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.080
[Guest]: where is it in practice and in fact very interestingly you know the 15th finance

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:20.840
[Guest]: commission which is currently on is if you look some of the things that it's working on i mean it

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:27.080
[Guest]: goes against the entire idea of federalism so and you know i mean ultimately what is the point

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:33.000
[Amit Varma]: of a single nation right i mean if the taxes are also not shared yeah it's it's bizarre right

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.760
[Amit Varma]: it's completely bizarre moving on now to a question from umesh gopinath and i thought he

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:43.800
[Amit Varma]: was being humorous so therefore i said that i will push for i will recommend that he get the

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:50.360
[Amit Varma]: prize but he hasn't got the price so i'm sorry because but it's a question worth asking and i

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:55.240
[Amit Varma]: presume he's joking and the question is what if there is a bigger story that we are not seeing

01:19:55.240 --> 01:20:00.600
[Amit Varma]: now what if it was all planned by modiji plus shaji that the first five years will be spent

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:05.320
[Amit Varma]: to just crush the opposition and the next five years are when the real vikas is going to happen

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:12.200
[Amit Varma]: without worrying about winning elections i hope that happens i sincerely hope that happens i i

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:18.520
[Amit Varma]: think he is if i may answer this i think that umesh you are overestimating the abilities and

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:23.240
[Amit Varma]: intelligence of these guys that you think that they can have grand plans in 2014 the next five

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:28.440
[Amit Varma]: years we will do no reforms no governance we will crush the opposition and then we will actually do

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:34.840
[Amit Varma]: some real work uh that doesn't quite fit into occam's razor of take the simplest explanation

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:44.680
[Amit Varma]: which is incompetence uh you wanted to uh point out a question by uh yes so there's this question

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:52.360
[Guest]: by ranju sarkar and i think you are better place to answer this he says why is this government

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:59.240
[Guest]: always in an election mode is the budget meant to be a political statement or despite a clear

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:05.560
[Guest]: mandate why is narendra modi reluctant to undertake big bang reforms okay so brief answer

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:10.680
[Amit Varma]: to this would be that what public choice theory would point out is that look the basic truth of

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:14.760
[Amit Varma]: economics is that human beings respond to incentives public choice economics tells you

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:19.960
[Amit Varma]: that that is also true of people in government what are the incentives of a politician it is

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:26.360
[Amit Varma]: to come to power once he has gotten to power what are his incentives it is to remain in power and to

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:30.920
[Amit Varma]: use the power to generate money and to use that money to generate more power it's an interplay

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:37.080
[Amit Varma]: between money and power and therefore if a government is not in constant election mode

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:42.760
[Amit Varma]: it would be a little bit surprising now what is the failure of our democracy and what we are not

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:49.000
[Amit Varma]: being able to handle is that ideally you would imagine in theory how a government performs when

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.440
[Amit Varma]: it comes to governance will determine how it does in politics in terms of getting reelected you

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:58.760
[Amit Varma]: provide good governance you get reelected you provide bad governance you don't get reelected

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:05.400
[Amit Varma]: that's how democracies are supposed to work i'm not sure that that is quite happening in india

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:10.920
[Amit Varma]: because a lot of the governance that i mean our politics is driven by driven today by these

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:15.400
[Amit Varma]: grander narratives and i won't go into the merits of those grander narratives but there are grander

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:21.960
[Amit Varma]: narratives which involve identities which you know might involve a hindu rashtra which again i

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:26.200
[Amit Varma]: won't make a value judgment on that but the point of the matter is that whether you carry out labor

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:33.240
[Amit Varma]: reforms or whether you keep the rbi autonomous is not an issue that is going to win you any votes

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:38.360
[Amit Varma]: which goes to the second part of the question that why hasn't modi carried out big bang reforms

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:44.040
[Amit Varma]: because there are no votes in it there are uh you know i did an episode with puja mera on an

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:48.600
[Amit Varma]: excellent book she wrote where she spoke about the political economy of the last five years and her

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:55.320
[Amit Varma]: take was that when the modi government came to power in 2014 they experimented a bit with some

01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:00.680
[Amit Varma]: reforms they did the you know the bankruptcy law and they were looking at um doing some small

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:06.040
[Amit Varma]: things but then they quickly realized as they lost a string of state elections that there is

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:10.360
[Amit Varma]: no political equity in that that it doesn't affect the politics at all and they quickly

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:15.560
[Amit Varma]: move to populism like puja's theory about demonetization was one of the reasons modi

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:20.280
[Amit Varma]: thought of it and one of the reasons it worked was that regardless of whether it was a good

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:27.800
[Amit Varma]: policy or a bad policy in practice it was viewed by the people as hurting the rich and that always

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:33.080
[Amit Varma]: sells whether in reality it does that or not is a different matter i'd say it hurt the poor more but

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:37.480
[Amit Varma]: the narrative sold and you know they won the up elections after that and they just won the last

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:44.520
[Amit Varma]: general elections so the government's focus is just on building narratives that sell in fact even

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.360
[Amit Varma]: these income taxes which you spoke of raising the high you know you've pointed out and it's

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:52.440
[Amit Varma]: perfectly logical that the you know the base of people who pay those taxes is so low it doesn't

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:55.880
[Amit Varma]: make a difference a lot of people love it a lot of people love it because the narrative is oh we

01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:01.000
[Guest]: are punishing the rich and rich i mean so that's see that also again you know if it's again this

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:08.840
[Guest]: is slightly convoluted and uh so this you know because we used to have high taxes okay we had a

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:16.760
[Guest]: huge black economy and because we had a huge black economy the normal guy did not go around to

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:25.320
[Guest]: respect the rich or the process of wealth creation and that is again you know it's coming back to

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:31.720
[Guest]: hurt us in this way so yeah i mean that's the full circle basically that's how it is politics

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:37.480
[Amit Varma]: and economics are sort of divorced good economics doesn't make for good politics and vice versa so

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:42.120
[Amit Varma]: what do we do another question from sanjay faloria who's a friend of yours yeah sanjay

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:47.880
[Guest]: and me we're both doing our phds together he completed it you did not no and therefore you

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:54.200
[Guest]: have landed up here i did not because i mean the the guide wanted me to sort of put some

01:24:54.200 --> 01:25:01.400
[Guest]: mathematics into the research proposal which i was not ready for so so sanjay's question is will

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:05.960
[Guest]: nudge theory work in the indian context you are the better person to answer this you are the

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:11.400
[Amit Varma]: behavioral economics boss well not really it was like as gurunath mayappan said in the context of

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:16.440
[Amit Varma]: the chennai super kings where he said i'm just an enthusiast i would say in this context i am just an

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:23.400
[Amit Varma]: enthusiast uh and i would say look the indian state does so many things by such hardcore coercion

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:30.120
[Amit Varma]: that you know nudging is something that i think uh you know product designers can

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:34.840
[Amit Varma]: use better user interface designers can use better but when it comes to the state

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:44.600
[Amit Varma]: our indian state just believes in hard coercion and not soft nudges so i mean i think it's in

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.680
[Amit Varma]: the economic survey that our chief economic advisor used the term and yeah i mean it's

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:53.480
[Amit Varma]: nice in theory and all but you know i really don't see the relevance so you know one of the

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:58.520
[Guest]: talking about nudges you know one of the areas where nudges get extensively used in europe

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:07.320
[Guest]: is what happens to the human body after death so in a lot of countries you have the opt-in

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:13.720
[Guest]: option wherein if you want your body to be donated uh you know after you die and i mean

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:20.280
[Guest]: and i mean and i know for things to happen you know whatever happens uh then you have to opt

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:27.960
[Guest]: in for it and in the countries which have this opt-in thing uh the the the number of donations

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:33.640
[Guest]: is very low uh then there are countries where there is the opt-out option the default yes the

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:39.240
[Guest]: default is that your body will be denoted you know will be donated for research or whatever i

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:44.200
[Guest]: mean or your organs might used on other people who need them so in that case the rates are high

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:51.880
[Guest]: because the option is to opt out and most people being as lazy as they are especially if they

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:58.360
[Guest]: already get they don't opt out so yeah i mean it's it's sort of macabre but yeah that's the

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:03.960
[Amit Varma]: nudge theory is is used quite a lot i mean the nudge i think though i think the phrase itself

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:08.280
[Amit Varma]: in this context of economics came from cass sunstein and it's interesting so last year

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:13.080
[Amit Varma]: cass sunstein wrote this book called on liberty same title as the john stuart mill book so

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.400
[Amit Varma]: instantly i ordered the book and it comes and i'm expecting it to be about liberty but the book

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:21.000
[Amit Varma]: should really have been called on choice architecture because it's only about nudging

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.040
[Amit Varma]: then i bought another book recently by him which is again it has some completely unrelated title

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:30.760
[Guest]: but it's only about nudging and this is the one on the government he writes two books every year

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.200
[Amit Varma]: he writes two books every year they all have different titles it makes it appear as if they're

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:38.200
[Amit Varma]: all about different things are all about nudging which is i mean credit to the guy

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:45.960
[Amit Varma]: yeah you're idle in a sense i mean how many budgets have you written about it's like

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:49.960
[Guest]: but that is you are the cast sunstein of budgets that's experience

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.240
[Guest]: what is experience other than having you know doing the same thing that's true over and over

01:27:55.240 --> 01:28:00.360
[Amit Varma]: again smartly that's true yeah i'm expecting him to write a travelogue like my trip through

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:06.280
[Amit Varma]: south africa or something and then it will all be about nudging uh but moving on from poor mr

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.840
[Amit Varma]: sunstein one question that a lot of people asked you so i won't even take any specific names here

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:15.880
[Amit Varma]: is the whole five trillion economy thing what's the deal i mean it's an impressive number is that

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:25.240
[Guest]: why it's there part of optics so see the thing is uh india is a 2.7 trillion 2.8 trillion dollar

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:33.160
[Guest]: economy right now and uh in the next by 2024 25 so you know so the so here's the thing so first

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:40.360
[Guest]: they said 2024 okay which basically meant five years but then now they're saying 2024 25 which

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:46.680
[Guest]: basically means six years so we have to go from 2.8 trillion to 5 trillion one thing is you know

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:55.480
[Guest]: we we are sort of uh setting a target in a currency which is not our own okay the currency it's the

01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:03.480
[Guest]: you know it's the american dollar now uh there are multiple things here so we we have to go from

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:11.080
[Guest]: 2.8 trillion to 5 trillion okay now it's not just our economic growth what will also matter at the

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:17.320
[Guest]: end of the day is the conversion rate between the rupee and the and the dollar right so the

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:24.520
[Guest]: government basically expects that if the economy uh grows from grows at around eight percent uh

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:29.400
[Guest]: in real terms and then there is four percent inflation so which basically means we grow in

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:37.480
[Guest]: twelve percent nominal terms so from 2.8 we'll reach uh five trillion but at the same time

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:43.240
[Guest]: the one dollar which is roughly worth around 70 rupees now will be worth 75 rupees by then

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:48.200
[Guest]: so you know you the the basic problem with this argument is that nobody really knows where the

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:53.800
[Guest]: foreign exchange market is headed the only thing that we can say for sure is that over a longish

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:59.480
[Guest]: period of time the rupee will depreciate against the dollar simply because our rate of inflation

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:05.160
[Guest]: is higher than the american rate of inflation so that purchasing power will get adjusted so

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:11.880
[Guest]: beyond that there is nothing it's just a it's it's a good you know in strategy terms it's called

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:17.240
[Guest]: a bhag you know a big hairy audacious goal so basically they call it hairy i have no idea i

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:22.760
[Guest]: don't you know see this is the problem you know i i spent two years doing an mba i remember these

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:28.600
[Guest]: big things and but if you ask me to get into the nitty-gritty i have no idea i mean that's a

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:32.760
[Amit Varma]: period of my life which i have completely eradicated from my memories i had long hair

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:37.880
[Amit Varma]: once and i suspect at that time all the girls who had crushes on me had big hairy audacious goals

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:46.200
[Guest]: maybe you know i'm sorry dad joke so it's a bhag in that sense that you know when so i can get

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:51.640
[Guest]: where it's coming from i mean if if you want to do x you obviously have to aim a little higher

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:58.120
[Guest]: so but then you know for for us to get around to achieve that there are so many things that

01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:04.280
[Guest]: sort of need to be uh set right so yeah it's not going to just happen you know you know you've

01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:10.840
[Guest]: given this target and now it will sort of uh automatically happen on its own it's not i mean

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:16.120
[Amit Varma]: it almost sounds like it's not the team of economists which is deciding a target it's a

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:21.640
[Amit Varma]: team of pr people saying what number sounds good and okay five trillion and then when you don't get

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:30.600
[Guest]: there you revise the estimates so currently we are 188 189 lakh crore economy right so let's say

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:34.680
[Guest]: if you were to sort of talk about in rupee terms you know the number to put out would probably be

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:42.440
[Guest]: 400 lakh crore but a 400 lakh crore just doesn't sound as interesting or as catchy as uh you know

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:51.320
[Guest]: five trillion so see anyway people have a problem in understanding how big a big number is right so

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:57.000
[Guest]: that that's the basic thing right so and if you take that into account and take into account the

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:03.320
[Guest]: fact that a trillion sounds so much so much more bigger than a lakh crore there you have it so yeah

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:08.280
[Amit Varma]: and even if you don't get there a we can revise the estimates and b we can just point out that hey

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:12.920
[Guest]: you know nehru didn't take us to five trillion either and you know and the funny thing is the

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:20.760
[Guest]: way we are going if for all we know that if if there is a sort of a crisis in the us uh

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:26.840
[Guest]: the dollar might very well depreciate against the rupee who knows yes so if the rupee appreciates

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:32.680
[Guest]: it will get easier for us to get to the five trillion uh number i mean it'll then just a

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:38.600
[Amit Varma]: part of it will just be an accounting entry so there you go fascinating uh i have taken up a

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:44.040
[Amit Varma]: lot of your time today so we'll kind of bring things gradually to an end with a final question

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:49.000
[Amit Varma]: by uh an apologies to all the people whose questions we haven't taken uh i didn't necessarily

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:55.960
[Amit Varma]: choose these uh with a final question by prashant dubey who asked um uh do you have any

01:32:55.960 --> 01:33:02.440
[Amit Varma]: recommendations to read more about the austrian school by which it basically means uh uh economics

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:08.440
[Amit Varma]: um and which in both of us replied to him on twitter so would you like to for the general

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:14.600
[Guest]: uh you know audience i think one book that i sort of keep going back to and which i've quite

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:21.720
[Guest]: learned quite a lot from was henry hazlitt's uh economics in one lesson and then the best part is

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:27.960
[Guest]: you don't even have to buy it it's really legally available on the internet i mean you don't have to

01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:32.760
[Amit Varma]: like you know i mean everything is available on the internet but not necessarily legally so

01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:37.800
[Amit Varma]: and the interesting thing about henry has its economics is one lesson is is based on an essay

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:42.360
[Guest]: by frederick bassia called that which is seen and that which is unseen and bussy of course is one of

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:48.040
[Amit Varma]: my heroes and window fallacy the yeah and this show is named after that essay so basically the

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:53.240
[Amit Varma]: scene in the unseen and henry has its economics in one lesson kind of actually you know one can

01:33:53.240 --> 01:34:00.440
[Guest]: read a lot of bastiat also and uh a lot of past books are actually available for uh bastia actually

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:05.320
[Guest]: didn't write books books as much as he wrote essays long essays so all these long essays are

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:12.600
[Guest]: available on the internet uh it's just that uh you know uh because it's a translation from french

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:18.360
[Guest]: and because it's it's you know 200 250 years old the hazlitt book works a little better but

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:24.440
[Guest]: after having read the hazlitt book i think it's a great idea to read bastia it's a bastia has a

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:29.320
[Amit Varma]: book called the law so look that up that is an absolute available on in kindle and it's free

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:33.560
[Amit Varma]: that's a masterpiece and what i would also recommend is thomas saville has a great book

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:37.160
[Amit Varma]: called basic economics which is a wonderful book he also wrote a book after that called

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:41.560
[Amit Varma]: applied economics but basically i mean both of us are fans of saville and everything there is

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:49.880
[Guest]: this great book called wealth poverty and politics that people should but uh you should read that

01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:54.360
[Amit Varma]: after you've read uh basic economics basic economics and also if you're looking for

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:59.000
[Amit Varma]: modern day textbooks there are textbooks by tyler carvin and alex tabarrok of marginal revolution

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.480
[Amit Varma]: who have both been on this podcast by the way but that's not why i'm recommending these books

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:08.360
[Amit Varma]: um i was a fan before they came on the podcast that's kind of why i invited them so the causation

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:13.000
[Amit Varma]: works the other way so they've written textbooks on macroeconomics and microeconomics check that

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:19.400
[Amit Varma]: out and a great online source is a marginal revolution university which has dozens of

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:26.440
[Amit Varma]: videos and simple economic concepts and is really really good in fact there's one book that i sort

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:33.720
[Guest]: of you know i learned quite a lot from it was called very very boringly principles of macroeconomics

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:40.120
[Guest]: and there was only one edition that ever got written it was a 1979 edition it was written

01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:46.120
[Guest]: by dr srirangarajan and bakuldholakya and dr ragnarajan at that point of time i think used

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:51.080
[Guest]: to teach at im amdabad and i used to have that book and i read it once and i lost it and i've

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:57.480
[Guest]: never been able to find a copy again and it was just a brilliant book i mean if you want to uh

01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:05.320
[Guest]: you know understand economics macroeconomics in the conventional way with a little bit of maths

01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:10.040
[Guest]: not like you know not maths which would sort of break your head but simple you know addition

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:16.840
[Guest]: subtraction division it's it's a great book if you can find a copy of it anywhere i mean

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:21.640
[Guest]: i haven't been able to find a copy over the years but it was just if any reader can and if

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:28.840
[Amit Varma]: any reader finds it please tag vivek on twitter he will pay a fortune for it yeah a fortune in

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:32.840
[Guest]: relative terms given what we are five trillion whatever we are earning from that five trillion

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:38.600
[Amit Varma]: a certain amount of that will join the gdp uh speaking of books so the actual last last question

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.000
[Amit Varma]: i'll ask is something that again a listener wanted to know what book are you writing right

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:49.640
[Guest]: now tell us okay so i'm writing this uh book called uh so let me give you a little bit of

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:56.360
[Guest]: background before i tell you what the books uh so basically uh i have an editor called sachin

01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:04.680
[Guest]: so sachin approached me uh with an idea on uh writing a book on the uh non-performing assets

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:09.720
[Guest]: of indian banks which we have done episodes on which we've done episodes on and i was like

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:16.520
[Guest]: i was like you know i just thought it's just too technical and and also my last book you know

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:22.520
[Guest]: with the benefit of hindsight i can say that it turned out to be a slightly more technical and i

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:27.720
[Guest]: mean obviously it was very thick uh then i would have ideally wanted to it to be so i was like a

01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:33.080
[Guest]: little apprehensive about you know whether i should you know write it or not then you know

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:40.680
[Guest]: i had a brainwave one day on what the title and uh the cover of the book should be so the title i

01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:45.640
[Guest]: thought of was bad money and i i i sort of thought that you know it should sort of be

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:54.200
[Guest]: uh you know written in blood against a black background some some you know something like

01:37:54.200 --> 01:38:00.200
[Guest]: that or maybe you know you have the rupee symbol disintegrating and so once i had the title i sort

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:05.960
[Guest]: of became very uh excited about writing the book because you know bad money was just it's just uh

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:09.640
[Guest]: it's just a cover you described would be perfect for crime fiction and of course keep telling you

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:16.280
[Guest]: but bad money is again you know ha so so this book is basically about uh uh the the the bad

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:21.960
[Guest]: loans the npas that public sector banks primarily have accumulated over the last decade but uh it's

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:28.840
[Guest]: not just about that it's also a lot about india's banking history uh and how things have sort of

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:35.240
[Guest]: gone wrong and there's a lot of uh basic economics in it as well i mean like one lesson

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:40.520
[Guest]: which i keep going back to over and over again is that there is no free lunch in economics

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:46.120
[Guest]: and it comes out beautifully in a lot of situations in this book i mean something

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:53.720
[Guest]: sometimes when you're writing and you realize so yeah so that's the book and i'm just about

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:59.240
[Guest]: probably i'll finish the first draft sometime next week so it's still some time away from

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:05.160
[Guest]: publishing probably early next year end of this year so it also depends on how fast

01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:10.440
[Guest]: the publishers move and it also depends on whether they like it or not how can they not like it and

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.560
[Guest]: besides i think you've reached the level i mean shahrukh khan of economics and all that

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:16.760
[Guest]: coming from you know you go in the off podcasting so
