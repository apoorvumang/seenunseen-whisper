00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.680
[Amit Varma]: What goes into the making of a life? Sometimes, when we look at someone at a particular point

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.920
[Amit Varma]: in time, it might appear that they are who they were meant to be. This could be hindsight

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.520
[Amit Varma]: bias in play. In hindsight, we see events following a linear path and everything seems

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.380
[Amit Varma]: bound to happen. That's never the case. But having said that, it also may not be the case

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.360
[Amit Varma]: that everything is random and anyone could be anything. We do have an essential nature,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.920
[Amit Varma]: even if that essential nature is itself accidental, and the paths we go down on conform to that.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Now, many of the episodes I've recorded in the last couple of years have been like oral

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.120
[Amit Varma]: histories and have an element of the memoir to them. And one common pattern I have seen

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.160
[Amit Varma]: is that my guests never planned to be where they landed up. When they were young, they

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.440
[Amit Varma]: did not have some grand bird's eye view with which they planned their lives. Instead, they

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.120
[Amit Varma]: were often locked into a moment they did something that made sense at the time, and one thing

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.880
[Amit Varma]: led to another. In fact, I invite you to think about your life. Are you where you plan to

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.440
[Amit Varma]: be? How much of it was intentional? If you had to do things all over again, what would

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.080
[Amit Varma]: you change? These thoughts came to my mind because this episode features a remarkable

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.880
[Amit Varma]: guest with a remarkable life. And speaking to her, it's clear that she did not set out

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.280
[Amit Varma]: to be remarkable to be a brave dissenter to go to prison for her beliefs. Instead, she

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.040
[Amit Varma]: always followed paths that interested her, that were authentic to herself, and to the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.760
[Amit Varma]: moment. And then life happened. And here we are.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.960
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.560
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.360
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is Trishta Settleward, who most of you

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.520
[Amit Varma]: will know as a human rights activist who has relentlessly fought to get justice for the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.440
[Amit Varma]: victims of the 2002 riots in Gujarat. She succeeded to some extent, but the fight continues,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.360
[Amit Varma]: and she even spent some time in jail recently, persecuted by a regime that she continues

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.960
[Amit Varma]: to fight. But Trishta is a lot more than just a bleeding heart activist, and her activism

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.360
[Amit Varma]: involves a lot more than the 2002 riots. She was born to an illustrious family of lawyers

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.520
[Amit Varma]: and could have followed in those footsteps and lived a plush life. She loved to write,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.840
[Amit Varma]: and she was interested in politics. Her first published letter to the editor in 1978 protested

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.360
[Amit Varma]: the authoritarianism of Indira Gandhi. She joined journalism after college and was a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.680
[Amit Varma]: reporter between 1983 and 1993. In that time, she covered various kinds of communal violence

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.760
[Amit Varma]: and realized that there was a deeper current in our society that mainstream media could

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.080
[Amit Varma]: not cover. She formed Communalism Combat in 1993 with her partner Javed Anand, with the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.920
[Amit Varma]: aim of fighting communalism from all communities. They wrote about the horror of what the Taliban

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.240
[Amit Varma]: was doing in Afghanistan, about the plight of Bangladeshi Hindus. They criticized the

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.480
[Amit Varma]: Jamaat-e-Islami in India. And Trishta herself wrote five important stories on what was unfolding

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.800
[Amit Varma]: in Gujarat before 2002. She saw society getting increasingly fractured and warned about Gujarat

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.680
[Amit Varma]: exploding into criminal violence well before it happened. And when the 2002 riots took

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.640
[Amit Varma]: place, she played a part in helping the victims and in fighting for justice for them. That's

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.920
[Amit Varma]: a fight we know her for, but she's also fighting for other causes, such as the unseen chaos

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.000
[Amit Varma]: that's unfolding in Assam over the impending Citizenship Act. She's also a fine scholar

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.760
[Amit Varma]: who's been teaching young students about history and politics for over two decades. In fact,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.560
[Amit Varma]: the thing that struck me most about Trishta was that she is both a thinker and a doer,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.960
[Amit Varma]: and the thinking and the doing inform each other. She's had a rich life and has tons

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.400
[Amit Varma]: of insight to share on our country and our times. I loved her memoir, Foot Soldier of

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.900
[Amit Varma]: the Constitution, which I recommend all of you buy. And I love this conversation. Note

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.580
[Amit Varma]: by the way that we didn't discuss a few things that are sub judice, but there is still so

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.560
[Amit Varma]: much here to marvel at and to learn from. Before we start though, let's take a quick

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.080
[Amit Varma]: commercial break.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.640
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it? Well, I'd love

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.320
[Amit Varma]: to help you. Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, The Art of

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.760
[Amit Varma]: Clear Writing. An online community has now sprung up of all my past students. We have

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.680
[Amit Varma]: workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community interaction.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.000
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.200
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises, much interaction,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.640
[Amit Varma]: a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.440
[Amit Varma]: or about $150, and is a monthly thing. So if you're interested, head on over to register

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.920
[Amit Varma]: at indiauncut.com slash clear writing. That's indiauncut.com slash clear writing. Being

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.200
[Amit Varma]: a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard and a clear

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.880
[Amit Varma]: idea of what you need to do to refine your skills. I can help you.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.480
[Amit Varma]: Teesta, welcome to the scene in the unseen. Great to be here, Amit.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, normally, when I'm sitting with a guest, we go a long way back and talk about

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.640
[Amit Varma]: their childhood and all of that. But with you, I want to go even further back. Because

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.400
[Amit Varma]: just now at lunch, we were talking about Maharashtra and Gujarat. And you were telling me about

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.200
[Amit Varma]: how Maharashtra has so many different syncretic traditions. So it's not just the RSS strain

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.640
[Amit Varma]: of a particular kind of Hindutva, which is relatively recent, like you pointed out, but

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.160
[Amit Varma]: it goes back centuries. And equally, you mentioned how Gujarat interestingly doesn't despite

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.600
[Amit Varma]: producing outliers, I guess, like Gandhi and Patel. Can you elaborate a little bit more

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600
[Guest]: on this for me?

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.880
[Guest]: Yeah, actually, it's a fascinating discussion in itself, because for many of us who look

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:50.880
[Guest]: at history and Indian constitution and law, not just in books, but in practice, have found

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:58.560
[Guest]: that this subcontinent, you know, the soil, this India, South Asia, has had a very strong

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:06.760
[Guest]: strain of resistance, if you like, of questioning of rationality, which goes back like, centuries,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.720
[Guest]: centuries, it could even go back to the early Indian period, or even the certainly the early

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:20.840
[Guest]: medieval period, early Indian as well. Because if you look at the entire question of Buddha

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.400
[Guest]: Buddhism, Jainism, Buddhism, then of course, the resurgence of Shankaracharya, trying to

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.480
[Guest]: bind it all back together for the Sanatan Dharma. Then you look at the early medieval

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.160
[Guest]: and you have the Bhakti Sufi traditions and you have, you know, across the country, and

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.560
[Guest]: particularly Western, Central, North India, Bengal, East India, Northeast, this entire

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.720
[Guest]: business of looking at faith, spirituality, the individual, her or his space in it and

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.840
[Guest]: questioning and always looking at equality and non-discrimination through it, has been

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.720
[Guest]: there, has been very much there. I mean, you can name them, you can look at Basavanna in

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:11.200
[Guest]: modern day Karnataka, Narayan, Guru, more modern period, you can look at Kabir in Banaras,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.960
[Guest]: you know, and we know where Banaras is today, and you look at Guru Nanak, and you look at

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.040
[Guest]: coming back to your, you know, your, the Western Indian, what I'm talking about, that RSS is

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.000
[Guest]: a very new thing. I mean, it's a new modern proto-fascist concept. It's, before that we

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.920
[Guest]: had Eknath, we had Namdev, we had Tukaram, and then we've had Phuleyambedkar. So the

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.600
[Guest]: argument for some of us is that the inherent values of the Indian Constitution, you know,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.760
[Guest]: which formally came to us with the discussions around the Karachi Resolution, which was an

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:51.680
[Guest]: Indian National Congress in the 1930s, where Subhash Chandra Bose as president and Gandhi

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.320
[Guest]: as the mentor, but it was Subhash Chandra Bose, the agricultural struggle, the workers

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.520
[Guest]: struggle, the left traditions that influenced and pushed the Congress into making the plea

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.320
[Guest]: for fundamental rights for all, which included workers' rights and women's rights and rights

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:14.400
[Guest]: of all genders, etc. Those are not entirely foreign. And anyway, I'm not trying to say

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.560
[Guest]: that there's anything wrong with internationalism, because we know the modern discourse that

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.760
[Guest]: came with the French Revolution was also a metamorphosis across continents. But there's

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.520
[Guest]: a strong strain of our people, particularly people who are lesser privileged in terms

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:39.960
[Guest]: of class and caste, questioning the rigidity of caste and of privilege. And Basavanna talked

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:49.840
[Guest]: about gender in a very, very strong way. So, you had the Rashtra Seva Dalas worked on Maharashtrian

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:57.440
[Guest]: women saints of the Bhakti tradition, single women. And later on, we saw Nargis and Jogin

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:04.080
[Guest]: in the middle part of the 20th century, you know, and she was representing that. It's

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.600
[Guest]: the Miras and the Janabais and all of that, who took to the streets singing to their God

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:16.160
[Guest]: and said, we are not going to be living within the family, within patriarchy and within the

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.640
[Guest]: bonds of marriage or whatever. And you had the Gargi and Jayabala in the Vedic period

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.080
[Guest]: also saying that we have a right to the Vedic scriptures. So, there has been a strong strain

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:31.480
[Guest]: of this. And all of this is also metamorphosed into the constitution as much as modern ideas

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:38.120
[Guest]: of equality, fraternity, justice and non-discrimination. Now, between Maharashtra and Gujarat, I found

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.080
[Guest]: it fascinating because I speak better Marathi than, though Gujarati is my mother tongue,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.520
[Guest]: but I speak and read better Marathi because this is my karmabhoomi, if you like, because

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.520
[Guest]: it's three, four generations we've lived here. But thanks to my paternal grandfather, I can

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:58.640
[Guest]: read and speak Gujarati as well. But I've seen that in Maharashtra, with all the rigidity

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:06.440
[Guest]: of a kind of Brahmanism and conservatism, which is evident in certain traditions, you've

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:12.280
[Guest]: always had this subaltern questioning and that has manifested itself, manifests itself

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.600
[Guest]: in reform. It manifests itself in something fascinating because I teach history in schools

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:25.360
[Guest]: and I try to go by what Fred said, that the classroom should be the, should be the location

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.840
[Guest]: for questioning and not for a one-way traffic between what you're told to be taught and

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:37.200
[Guest]: what you're told to be learned. He said in 1848, Savitri Bai Phule and her partner opens

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.680
[Guest]: the first all-girls school, possibly in the world, possibly in the world. And what is

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:49.400
[Guest]: the, what is the concept that in one class, you like girls of different castes and communities

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.400
[Guest]: studying together. Now, this is before you have the civil rights movement in the US and

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.480
[Guest]: the anti-segregation civil rights movement where black girls could also come into the

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.960
[Guest]: classroom. So, what does this mean? It means that there's a huge churning and an assertion

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:13.120
[Guest]: and that I think still survives in Maharashtra with all its other regressive tendencies.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.000
[Guest]: Gujarat has been different and because of my work as first as a journalist, then as

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.560
[Guest]: an activist in Gujarat, I've always asked that what is this difference? Is it because

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:29.160
[Guest]: there was no strong anti-caste movement like you see in many other parts of the country,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.080
[Guest]: particularly in Maharashtra? Of course, you had Narmad and his poetry apart from Gandhi

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:40.520
[Guest]: and Patel. Of course, you had Wali Gujarati, one of our, Wali Dakhani, one of our early

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.720
[Guest]: Urdu poets coming and settling in Ahmedabad and calling Gujarati his own land. It was

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:52.520
[Guest]: his tomb that was dug open on 28th of February 2002. But there's a mercantilism which runs

00:11:52.520 --> 00:12:01.440
[Guest]: across communities. There is a sort of prosaic non-questioning that is prevalent, you know,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.560
[Guest]: so that has affected things there. And therefore, I think for the project for the Hindu Rashtra

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:14.600
[Guest]: and the project for the masochist authoritarian state to revile and to discredit Gandhi in

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:22.320
[Guest]: the land of his birth, Porbandar, Gujarat was very, very important, has been very important.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:29.560
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of strands I want to sort of follow up on. And the first is this that if we look

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:36.200
[Amit Varma]: back through the centuries, if we look at that tradition of questioning existing structures

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:43.360
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth, I would imagine that for most of our history, those would not be

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.240
[Amit Varma]: against the state because the state would be a very distant kind of thing. It would

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.600
[Amit Varma]: more be against power structures in society around you where you see caste play itself

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.880
[Amit Varma]: out, or you see gender play itself out, and so on and so forth. And this sense of this

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.640
[Amit Varma]: strong authoritarian state, which is like a distant beast, somewhere far away, how do

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:11.760
[Amit Varma]: you even rebel, blah, blah, blah, seems to be a relatively recent phenomenon, if we talk

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:19.160
[Amit Varma]: in terms of centuries. Has that dimmed the fire somewhat? Because just kind of looking

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.840
[Amit Varma]: back through the decades of our independence, one strand that kind of stands out is just

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.600
[Amit Varma]: one of apathy, one of inertia that you let things happen, you know, people almost become

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.160
[Amit Varma]: fatalistic. Now, it's possible that people were always fatalistic. And, you know, it's

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.240
[Amit Varma]: a bit of selection bias that we remember all the rebels and all the countercultures and

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.280
[Amit Varma]: everything, and that those exist today as well. But is it that it just seems harder

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.680
[Amit Varma]: to fight the distant state, which you know, you can't beat anyway. So, you know, you just

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.400
[Amit Varma]: get on with things.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:56.560
[Guest]: You know, I think it also depends on what history we read, and which struggles we pick

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:02.320
[Guest]: and which icons we remember. I've been fortunate through the work I've chosen to do, which

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.680
[Guest]: has not become a ninth generation, high profile lawyer that I could have been because given

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.880
[Guest]: the settler tradition, I could have been the ninth and you know, apart from maybe being

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.560
[Guest]: good at my job, I could have earned all sorts of money, but that's not the issue. The point

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:23.360
[Guest]: is, one chose a path of, it's not about activism, it's about interrogating power structures

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.160
[Guest]: at various levels. So, apart from the work I'm more known for, which is human rights

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:34.000
[Guest]: and fighting for justice in the courts, one of my passions is education and pedagogy of

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.680
[Guest]: history teaching, and social science teaching in the classroom. And for that, we had this

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.240
[Guest]: coach project, which we kind of undertake, and we are doing it in municipal schools and

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:49.680
[Guest]: private schools in different parts of the country. Now, fortunately, one has been able

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:56.280
[Guest]: to look at therefore, history and turn it on its head. And if I, answering your question,

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:04.640
[Guest]: if I ask you that then what made the Adivasis and the agriculturalists be the first challengers

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:10.560
[Guest]: to colonial rule, before anybody from the cities got up and found out even before Dadabhai

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:18.720
[Guest]: Naoroji's historic pamphlet on poverty? I think, because they experienced firsthand

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:26.280
[Guest]: what colonialism and to what extent colonial power economically and culturally debauched

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:31.000
[Guest]: them, you know, which is not to say earlier oligarchies, coming to your question earlier

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.120
[Guest]: oligarchies or monarchs had an equitable relationship with them. No, there was a feudal relationship,

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:44.760
[Guest]: they would take their share, but they left the lands alone. Okay, they left the lands

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:52.400
[Guest]: largely alone, there was a transactional relationship, which was, of course, iniquitous, but what

00:15:52.400 --> 00:16:00.160
[Guest]: colonialism did was completely ravaged our land, our population and our people. If you

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.280
[Guest]: look at Indigo, Indigo rebellion, the Santal rebellion, I mean, I mean, I've been fortunate

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.920
[Guest]: enough to work with Adivasi, All India Union of Forest Working People for the last nine

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:17.040
[Guest]: years and I have seen firsthand those struggles and how they've kept their oral histories

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.640
[Guest]: alive and that has opened my eyes to the fact that we've really not looked at urban India

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:28.240
[Guest]: and upper caste, upper class India, liberal India has not looked at these subaltern histories

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:35.160
[Guest]: which have been manifest in challenging colonialism. I mean, that is why the land law was passed

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.760
[Guest]: in 1848, that is why the forest act was passed in 1927 because the British had to clamp down

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:48.160
[Guest]: on these struggles and if you look at the way the lawyers and the doctors and the names

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.760
[Guest]: you and I know or we knew in childhood started fighting for freedom and all of them are very

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.320
[Guest]: admirable, that happened like 150 years later, but these struggles had already been born

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:04.560
[Guest]: and were being challenged and they lost lives at huge cost, you know, there's Birsa Munda,

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:11.120
[Guest]: there's named from Assam to Maharashtra to Karnataka and these are modern-day constructs,

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:18.280
[Guest]: but to Bengal huge, Tibhaga struggle to Telangana, modern-day Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, you

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.520
[Guest]: had the agriculturalists and the Adivasis challenging colonial powers like nobody else

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.000
[Guest]: did, you know. So, I think that is a very important thing to remember in terms of answering

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.040
[Guest]: your question. I think a point will come when I think even with this fractured values that

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.640
[Guest]: neoliberalism has caused us where all of us are in little aspirational bubbles and it's

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.680
[Guest]: not easy to collectively organize or unionize or protest anymore, traditionally protest

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:52.240
[Guest]: anymore. I think a time will come and I just hope that human cost is not too high by then

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.880
[Guest]: when people will just find what's happening is too much, just too much, even though the

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.840
[Guest]: state is, it's not distant ever. The state is never distant. In fact, today the state

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.680
[Guest]: appears very oppressive and very intrusive just like the colonial state was and I think

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.760
[Guest]: what we are experiencing today is a kind of neo-colonialism really because if you look

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.400
[Guest]: at the corporatization on the one hand and the snatching away of civil rights on the

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:22.120
[Guest]: other and of course minority rights being right out there first, that's what we are

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:28.080
[Guest]: seeing. So, and constitutionalism and what the freedom struggle fought for is being turned

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:35.920
[Guest]: on its head. So, Ambedkar becomes an icon for the regime and yet the collected works

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:42.200
[Guest]: of Ambedkar, 18 volumes are sold without the six critical volumes at the Delhi Book Fair

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:52.320
[Guest]: which is the most and which are those caste and minorities, sorry state and minorities,

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.080
[Guest]: annihilation of caste, riddles in Hinduism, the most critical books of Ambedkar when it

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:04.880
[Guest]: comes to the Hindu religious and social structure are not part of the official volume sold by

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.680
[Guest]: the government of India anymore. So, you are picking and choosing, you can't ignore Ambedkar,

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.720
[Guest]: you can't ignore Bhagat Singh, you can't ignore Subhash Chandra Bose. So, you pick

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:21.800
[Guest]: and choose and you appropriate them and you try and hollow them out. The essence of these

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:28.840
[Guest]: people was what they stood for. I mean Bhagat Singh's writing on the dangers of communalism

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:36.840
[Guest]: of all kinds, Ambedkar's writing on not just the caste question but also on communalism

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:42.480
[Guest]: and the state majoritarian project and why even I feel like really looking at Gandhi's

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.760
[Guest]: stand on the communal award and the communal electorate because I think Ambedkar was right

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:53.360
[Guest]: in saying that reserved constituencies should allow that section to vote for that section

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.080
[Guest]: because otherwise you won't have representation of Dalits and minorities in Parliament and

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:02.720
[Guest]: we are seeing that. So, so many issues get thrown up and I think a time will come when

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:09.800
[Guest]: I think the apathy will be overcome by the sheer intrusion of the horror that the state

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.720
[Guest]: is undertaking at the moment.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:16.920
[Amit Varma]: So, number of strands to go down on but it's interesting you should mention about how people

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.520
[Amit Varma]: are trying to appropriate Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh and so on because we are recording this

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:27.840
[Amit Varma]: on October 27th and just yesterday there was this announcement of you know Arvind Kejriwal

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:33.120
[Amit Varma]: saying we must have Laxmi and Madhurga on the currency notes because our economy will

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.680
[Amit Varma]: do well and on the background there were these photographs of Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh and

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.360
[Amit Varma]: you know I mean what would those men have made of something like this and when I meant

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.840
[Amit Varma]: a distant state I didn't mean a distant as in it doesn't affect our lives. Of course

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.680
[Amit Varma]: it does. It's distant in terms of accountability, seeming accountability but its tentacles are

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:56.920
[Amit Varma]: all over us. I refer to our state as a predatory state. I'm fascinated by what you said earlier

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.800
[Amit Varma]: because you're right that you know what we make of history sometimes depends on how we've

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:11.080
[Amit Varma]: studied it and what prism we are looking at it from and what you mentioned about the first

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.680
[Amit Varma]: sort of pushback against colonialism coming from Adivazis and agriculturalists is not

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.280
[Amit Varma]: something I've really read much about. So, why don't you you know give me a little potted

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.280
[Guest]: history.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:25.000
[Guest]: I'll send you a booklet which we co-drafted that is one of my mentors who's taught me

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:32.040
[Guest]: so much Ashok Ashok Choudhury who's the part of this union and myself he was kind enough

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.160
[Guest]: to say that I should get a joint byline for it though I think he did a lot of the work

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.160
[Amit Varma]: I did.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.760
[Guest]: Is it downloadable? So, I'll put it in the show notes and my listeners can download it.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.600
[Guest]: So, we've done a chapter for this book that is a part of a foreign university publication

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.440
[Guest]: and we also brought out a booklet for the union and CJP and I think it's very important

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:55.000
[Guest]: to look at this because it tells us four or five things it tells us first of all that

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.520
[Guest]: coming back to your question that this history is very important history of struggle because

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.680
[Guest]: the history of struggle is the history of actually obtaining your rights and that's

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:09.400
[Guest]: always a fundamental for any civil liberties activists which I primarily am that no rights

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.400
[Guest]: have come for easy no rights have come for free okay they don't come unless you there's

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:20.480
[Guest]: a struggle for them worldwide we've seen that from Africa to the United States to any part

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.720
[Guest]: of the world I mean even now I mean if you look at the United States there's still barely

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:31.120
[Guest]: a recognition of what they've done to their own American Indian people and that conversation

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.040
[Guest]: is beginning to happen in Australia to some extent with the with the indigenous and the

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:42.640
[Guest]: Maori populations and all and it's a painful conversation because it's not easy but I think

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:48.200
[Guest]: all of us particularly from the privileged sections need to have that because we we don't

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:53.120
[Guest]: realize to what extent that appropriation of resources has happened by those of us who

00:22:53.120 --> 00:23:01.840
[Guest]: have come from from privileged sections so coming back to this you know during the COVID

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.880
[Guest]: period in fact which was otherwise a very difficult period because none of us could

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:10.320
[Guest]: travel as much we normally do and particularly going to some areas we undertook this exercise

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:16.120
[Guest]: of ensuring that all of us in the I'm not that citizen for justice and peace the organization

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:20.520
[Guest]: which I represent and also the other one of which I'm vice president which is the Akhil

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.480
[Guest]: Bharatiya Vanjan Shamjivi Union that the in all the units of the unions we should stay

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:31.720
[Guest]: connected and CJP helped helped helped hugely in this because we said that you know technology

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.920
[Guest]: is such a faraway thing and technology in the village and the Gram Sabha how do you

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:42.000
[Guest]: do it so we sort of did these zoom trainings and the zoom workshops I mean connectivity

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.800
[Guest]: India is very we think we are greatly committed very very poor if you look at the non-urban

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:51.720
[Guest]: areas so all of those were huge challenges we tried to overcome them and we started having

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:57.480
[Guest]: weekly meetings if what eventually became Gram Sabha meetings on zoom I mean I cannot

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.680
[Guest]: even tell you what that experience was because I could be sitting in Bombay or Pune or Delhi

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:08.160
[Guest]: wherever I was in that one camera that was in Sonbhadra in UP where Sukala was the president

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:13.760
[Guest]: of our union she's the most amazing woman she's been jailed twice in her lifetime and

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.760
[Guest]: unlike me when she was in jail for a month she didn't eat food she just survived on fruit

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.680
[Guest]: and milk I don't know how she did that so she would be sitting on her camera on a phone

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:30.920
[Guest]: phone camera with at least 150 women in the same room and each one would have their turn

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.160
[Guest]: to speak on the zoom and all of us would be able to listen so it was amazingly humbling

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:42.520
[Guest]: and democratizing process and through that we decided collectively that knowledge about

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:50.080
[Guest]: the constitution and Adivasi rights and the making of the Forest Rights Act of 2006 which

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:55.240
[Guest]: is our mantra for the Adivasi and indigenous movement because it's the law that came about

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.400
[Guest]: because of these collective struggles in the land and forest because it turns the whole

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.840
[Guest]: notion of elite conservation on its head that you can't really conserve environment without

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.440
[Guest]: protecting the rights of the people who've lived in those environs you know and because

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:15.600
[Guest]: they are the best conservers of that it's not a hostile positioning it has to be a collaborative

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:21.760
[Guest]: thing so when this started to happen you realize that they were also during the COVID period

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.920
[Guest]: commemorating their histories all the time so they were saying we will start our own

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:32.440
[Guest]: kind of schools which will be shifting schools which will be telling our own histories and

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.000
[Guest]: the histories of these struggles are alive to them we think that you know we have to

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.960
[Guest]: dig them up from the odd historian who actually has had the grace to look at Adivasi struggles

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:48.880
[Guest]: in English or Bengali and the Bengali translation or Hindi translation and there have been some

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:55.480
[Guest]: amazing bureaucrats also from the IS and earlier from the British colonial period who documented

00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:01.080
[Guest]: some of these despite being part of a colonial hierarchy and you collect this information

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:06.960
[Guest]: and then you know these struggles are being actually today celebrated commemorated as

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:12.000
[Guest]: well they haven't forgotten them but then you give it a discussion gives it a deeper

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.160
[Guest]: form and a context you connect it up with today's struggles and through those exercises

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.560
[Guest]: that one and a half two year period and through that we saw the farmers struggle okay and

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:26.760
[Guest]: I want to mention this because it was an amazing thing what what happened to India during that

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:31.600
[Guest]: pandemic particularly the second half I mean you saw that from June of 2020 and then you

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:38.480
[Guest]: saw November 2020 and you saw how that I mean where was the pandemic for those for the farmers

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:45.080
[Guest]: who went and sat at outside Delhi you know and I mean they compelled and impelled all

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.520
[Guest]: of us to to look at their struggle and they brought history and context to their struggle

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.520
[Guest]: because everything they were saying particularly the BKU Ugran and all they were talking about

00:26:54.520 --> 00:27:01.760
[Guest]: Bhagat Singh's grandfather and Punjab and you know what what the what the impoverishment

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.360
[Guest]: of colonial rule meant and how our policies are taking us back in that direction by not

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:12.000
[Guest]: by passing laws that are going to corporatize agriculture completely and leave the bargaining

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.280
[Guest]: power of the farmer out of the question so you know all these things are very very crucial

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:26.080
[Guest]: so I think for me it has been a learning through actually working with people's struggles and

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.960
[Guest]: having the humility to always understand that you don't know it all in fact you're in a

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:36.840
[Guest]: constant process or yes you bring something of your experience and learning to the process

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.920
[Guest]: and that's why it's collaborative and important but there's so much you need to learn actually

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.200
[Guest]: from people's struggle and you know like we were talking earlier that we are a strongly

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:50.520
[Guest]: oral history tradition you know and if you remember the Pathalkadi movement you know

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:56.560
[Guest]: which father Stan and others when father Stan died in judicial tragically died in I mean

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:03.200
[Guest]: to the judicial murder but that Pathalkadi's struggle was doing just this in in Tharkhand

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:09.840
[Guest]: you know what were they saying they were saying that we will on stones and on pillars put

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:15.400
[Guest]: up our constitutional rights which have been granted to us so whether it is schedule nine

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.600
[Guest]: or schedule five or the constitution or whether it is article the directive principles which

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:26.400
[Guest]: give Adivasi rights or whether it is a Niyam Giri judgment or any of the judgments that

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.680
[Guest]: the court has given us we will put that down so tomorrow when the forest official comes

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.000
[Guest]: and pretends not to know of these laws which have been passed by the Indian Parliament

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.760
[Guest]: we'll say we'll tell you we'll do a legal education for you you know and there is this

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:46.480
[Guest]: very strong belief that the constitution is ours among people of this country that the

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:54.600
[Guest]: laws the progressive laws passed the recognition of land rights recognition of forest rights

00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:00.480
[Guest]: the land acquisition law which was amended and by the UPA to government before the present

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:06.560
[Guest]: regime overturned it again all of these were not because the UPA to government wanted to

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:12.320
[Guest]: give it it was because there was being a coalition government being not a authoritarian strong

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.640
[Guest]: government they were compelled to listen to voices from the ground and that's what a democracy

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:22.600
[Guest]: is so I think coming back to your question of history and Adivasi history it all boils

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:29.520
[Guest]: down to working with communities on an equitable basis equal basis and realizing that any struggle

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.680
[Guest]: that you're involved in today has to hark back to your past because eventually you are

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:41.280
[Guest]: based on your symbolisms your I mean the strong women's presence in Adivasi struggles has

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:47.960
[Guest]: been there from the beginning the very strong women's presence number of women lost to the

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:52.960
[Guest]: battle against communal colonialism has been huge they know the names they know the name

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:59.160
[Guest]: they sing songs to them they know that they advocated education for the kids they educated

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.800
[Guest]: the rights over forest produce and that it should not that should not go to the colonial

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:10.960
[Guest]: powers and the forest bureaucracy but unfortunately there's always been this distance between

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:17.520
[Guest]: urban and rural and Adivasi and non-Adivasi and hence it's taken a while for the rest

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.680
[Guest]: of us to open our eyes to it.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.680
[Amit Varma]: So there are about five different directions I want to digress in but I'll just pick one

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:30.720
[Amit Varma]: and digress in that and it's a slightly long-winded question which I've explored in past episodes

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:38.160
[Amit Varma]: with different people there are two kinds of forces that we have seen in modern times

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:45.680
[Amit Varma]: and the first force which comes with urbanization and capitalism and all of those with all their

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:51.680
[Amit Varma]: you know other positive effects is of a certain kind of homogenization which leads to a loss

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.480
[Amit Varma]: in diversity I mean one metaphor for this is a Cavendish banana which is of course a

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:01.640
[Amit Varma]: banana that we exported to the world and then you know it made sense in the US economies

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.920
[Amit Varma]: of scale whatever then it was brought back to India and now it is kind of killing all

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:11.440
[Amit Varma]: indigenous sorts of bananas and that's an example with bananas where your diversity

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:17.160
[Amit Varma]: is driven out and everything is becoming homogeneous and rice is the same and I had assumed that

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.360
[Amit Varma]: there's a similar thing happening with languages and dialects like one of my previous guests

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.520
[Amit Varma]: Vinay Singhal not the Hindutva Vinay Singhal this is a young entrepreneur who runs a company

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:32.320
[Amit Varma]: called Stage what he once told me ki you know bhasha sheher mein hoti hai boli sheher ke

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:37.280
[Amit Varma]: bahar hoti hai you know the languages of the city the dialects are outside and I had assumed

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.320
[Amit Varma]: and lamented that the logical direction is going to be that dialects are gradually going

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.360
[Amit Varma]: to die out because when a young person who is from a village goes to a city the incentives

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.600
[Amit Varma]: will be to fit in and to speak in their dominant language so you might forget your dialect

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:57.920
[Amit Varma]: of Hindi and speak Hindi and gradually that's what happens what Vinay is doing with a stage

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:04.960
[Amit Varma]: is demonstrating the opposite effect where a stage is an OTT for Bharat but it's not

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:10.240
[Amit Varma]: an OTT for Indian languages like Hindi and Punjabi it's an OTT for dialects like Haryanvi

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.920
[Amit Varma]: and Rajasthani and is doing incredibly well and again capitalism playing a part technology

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:21.120
[Amit Varma]: playing a part that individuals are being empowered with the means of production and

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:26.520
[Amit Varma]: in some cases perhaps a means of communication where they can keep their culture alive where

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:32.320
[Amit Varma]: things don't have to scale it's almost an opposite of these forces of homogenization

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.200
[Amit Varma]: and I want to ask you about this because when you speak of all these different oral history

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:42.000
[Amit Varma]: traditions stories that have come down the danger always is that these stories will be

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.360
[Amit Varma]: lost because you move to a city or you know gradually over time things erode and things

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:53.360
[Amit Varma]: wither away and God knows how much we've lost but then there is also the hope that people

00:32:53.360 --> 00:33:00.820
[Amit Varma]: will instead of being embarrassed by their origins can take pride in it can find community

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:06.160
[Amit Varma]: in it and and can you know take it into a different direction so it's not a very well

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:11.200
[Amit Varma]: articulated question slightly long-winded but just looking at these two forces since

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:17.360
[Amit Varma]: you work so much at the grassroots and on the ground with such a wide variety of people

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.740
[Amit Varma]: what is your sense of this that is it something that we should be hopeful that people who

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:27.760
[Amit Varma]: earlier did not have a voice or a way to preserve their memories and their traditions do they

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:35.120
[Guest]: now have more of it I come back to this whole business of history and I've learned so much

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:40.360
[Guest]: from many of our most renowned historians whether it is Romila, Thapar, Rocky and Panikkar

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:45.160
[Guest]: and I'm talking about the 80s 80s and 90s when we used to hold workshops with them first

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:50.280
[Guest]: to learn and then I organized workshops with them for teachers and you've got a great interview

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.680
[Guest]: of Romila ji also I'll link that from the show notes for me the most I mean and for

00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:01.240
[Guest]: them I organized three workshops where they came and actually interacted with the school

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:08.040
[Guest]: teachers from about maybe 40 schools in Bombay two schools each and three four days they

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:14.560
[Guest]: interacted and so and my thought behind that because Khoj the pedagogy of Khoj was evolving

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:20.480
[Guest]: at that stage now we've got about 54 modules going and resources permitting we can do that

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.400
[Guest]: or we can't do that kind of workshop all the time but we are editing it and we're trying

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:32.200
[Guest]: to make it available so we can use that input idea being that the those original thinkers

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.320
[Guest]: and historians who are actually looking at history in a particular way should interact

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:42.600
[Guest]: directly with the carriers of that history into the classroom so that that pedagogy of

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:49.820
[Guest]: a non-didactic teaching not no final full stop always a question mark have the humility

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:53.560
[Guest]: and courage to say you don't know something and you look it up and come back and the child

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:59.240
[Guest]: will respect you more the young mind will respect you more not less all of that went

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.080
[Guest]: into this exercise so I remember those kind of early days when I was also sort of learning

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:09.720
[Guest]: all this and I'm still learning is that they would say that you know and that's when Narcissus

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:16.280
[Guest]: of course it's going to be 100 years old in 1925 into 2025 so it's worked very hard for

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.920
[Guest]: what it's done apart from acting having obnoxious amounts of money which it shouldn't have but

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:29.120
[Guest]: that's not the point that one of the bulwarks against authoritarian supremacism is local

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:34.240
[Guest]: histories and diversity and pluralism okay this was always what we said and came up with

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:39.080
[Guest]: at the end of these discussions and workshops that and we need to do this at various levels

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:44.680
[Guest]: we need to do it as at the at the finer academic historical level where there's a certain rigor

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:50.960
[Guest]: of the discipline where local histories emerge and maybe even contradict the national narrative

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:56.640
[Guest]: doesn't matter let the let the dialectic emerge but we also need to do the level of people

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.960
[Guest]: and communities which is the question you are asking so I think it's very important

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.120
[Guest]: and this continues to be a passion for some of us you know and we are also doing so many

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.480
[Guest]: things that it doesn't always happen the way we want it to happen but but wherever I go

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.480
[Guest]: wherever I speak into workshops speak about civil rights liberties I keep trying to say

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.680
[Guest]: that put together a group of citizens whether it's Belgaum whether it is Mangalore whether

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:24.720
[Guest]: it is Chiplun a tiny seaside town in Maharashtra put together you'll always have those 10-15

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.720
[Guest]: people 5 people 4 people who are obsessed with your past and your history and your tradition

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:35.640
[Guest]: put them together meet regularly start documenting and put it out you know because I think that

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:42.640
[Guest]: is our only bulwark against this this top-down homogenization which has a sinister political

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:47.400
[Guest]: motive without question I think this is what we've tried to bring into the coach classroom

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.720
[Guest]: and if you give me a few minutes I want to share this because it was fascinating for

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:58.720
[Guest]: us when we evolved these modules and one of the modules is which we do I mean unfortunately

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:03.200
[Guest]: because they're dealing with India school structure and the classroom and we don't make

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.600
[Guest]: it a honeymoon experiment with those special schools we've we've decided to look at the

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:14.120
[Guest]: school as it is for everybody you know which is a problem but we have to tackle it so we've

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:19.080
[Guest]: tried to do it in middle school like 5th 6th 7th a three-year program not not necessarily

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:23.840
[Guest]: go 8th and 9th only special classes because the whole exam pressure gets too much etc

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.920
[Guest]: so towards the end between the 6th and 7th we do this migratory history model you know

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.720
[Guest]: which is my history the child's history the idea is to introduce to the young mind which

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:41.560
[Guest]: is about 10 11 12 by then 11 12 by then that let's explore your family history each each

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:46.000
[Guest]: each one of you need to explore your history and how do you we don't finish it in one class

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.600
[Guest]: ever it goes through three or four sessions once a week maybe you come back to it even

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:57.880
[Guest]: a month later two months later idea is ask questions in your family and in your community

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:03.440
[Guest]: where are we from which village which district which state which language do we speak do

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:09.280
[Guest]: we have connections with that with that place still do we go back if not where did we directly

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.080
[Guest]: come from there to Mumbai or Pune wherever the class is being held or did we go somewhere

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:19.960
[Guest]: in between and start chasing this start chasing it make notes jot it down if you ask enough

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.840
[Guest]: questions you'll find a couple of people who are willing to kind of wax eloquent about

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.680
[Guest]: this once you get them to wax eloquent cross check the sources a little bit cross check

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:34.480
[Guest]: with two three people the facts and all that and start penning this history migratory history

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:41.360
[Guest]: of say Dhruv Prajapati or whatever the name is and start writing it down and then at the

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:47.000
[Guest]: end of nine months one and a half years whenever it's ready when these are sort of shared in

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.760
[Guest]: a live classroom atmosphere I cannot begin to even describe to you what happens in the

00:38:52.760 --> 00:39:02.320
[Guest]: classroom because the entire temperature changes the classroom sort of almost becomes from

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:09.560
[Guest]: a kind of a uniform straight in a line benches it suddenly becomes multicolored colorful

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:15.200
[Guest]: somebody brings in a Kannada word somebody brings in a Telugu word Tulu word Urdu couplet

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:21.560
[Guest]: a funny story a tragic story and the diversity is really lived and felt because that's how

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:26.880
[Guest]: all our realities are whether Mumbai might be more than that some cities might be less

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:33.960
[Guest]: but I show me one one one classroom any part of India or the world where this diversity

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:39.640
[Guest]: does not exist we are all we are all migrated from somewhere to somewhere we are all creatures

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.320
[Guest]: of movement and travel that's what human beings are and maybe some are not but even that is

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:51.160
[Guest]: very interesting so I think that whole concept that you understand each other through the

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:56.160
[Guest]: story through the language through the past through the present is very important for

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.640
[Guest]: the young mind to develop and if you do that I feel and that's been one of our reasons

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:06.120
[Guest]: why we are doing COGE even now after 20 32 years is that it's a very small thing it it

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.560
[Guest]: it'll take a long time but but but the young minds who go through it never give up that

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:18.640
[Guest]: questioning and I don't believe in this business of teaching secularism or teaching the Constitution

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:25.000
[Guest]: you can't do what you can do is if you want to share an understanding of article 14 and

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.080
[Guest]: 15 which is equality and non-discrimination then you have to teach them about discrimination

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:35.200
[Guest]: share stories about discrimination and struggles against discrimination so that's the only

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:41.960
[Guest]: be a sense of what that article is will actually take root in that young mind and then you

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:46.160
[Guest]: at the end of 13 years might get a citizen that is a questioning citizen and not just

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:51.800
[Guest]: somebody who's looking for job and pay hikes so I think that has been the that has been

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:58.240
[Guest]: the basis of this whole thing when we look at homogenization when we look at authoritarianism

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:05.120
[Guest]: it's all connected why is there this obsession whether you look at the fundamentalism of

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:11.800
[Guest]: political Islam or whether you look at Hindutva or if you look at extremely rigid Buddhism

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:17.080
[Guest]: that Sri Lanka also threw up when it massacred so many Tamils and not Sri Lanka why is this

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:23.160
[Guest]: obsession with homogenizing and uniformity it's as if it's as if diversity itself is

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:28.600
[Guest]: a threat and therefore the patriarchy comes in the rigidity comes in the attacks on women

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:33.600
[Guest]: come in all of this so I think the ability to connect some of all of these things is

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:39.080
[Guest]: very very important and can we do that can we do that in our struggles can we form alliances

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:45.440
[Guest]: in our struggles this has been an abiding concern and question and I don't think we've

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:51.400
[Guest]: always succeeded but I think the effort itself is very important effort itself is very important

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:56.600
[Guest]: because you're able to see that not just this struggle which you've taken up just now is

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.760
[Guest]: important of course it is but there are also many other myriad struggles that need to be

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:07.440
[Guest]: looked at to be able to question this absolutely crude homogenization that we are seeing.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.520
[Amit Varma]: I find this story you've told of the magic you created in the classroom very resonant

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:17.880
[Amit Varma]: because it feeds in with a theme that I think about a fair bit which is the importance of

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.480
[Amit Varma]: the concrete in our lives like what often happens is that if we just think in terms

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:29.360
[Amit Varma]: of abstractions like nationalism or purity or race or the other or Hindu or Muslim those

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:36.040
[Amit Varma]: abstractions can be dangerous and can lead us down you know problematic paths but the

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.960
[Amit Varma]: moment you make it concrete and I see that's what's happening in this classroom that's

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:44.680
[Amit Varma]: what it seems like to me that it's almost like a show don't tell brought to life that

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:51.680
[Amit Varma]: each child is making herself concrete by talking about her past and where she's come from and

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:56.520
[Amit Varma]: you know showing her authentic self also in a sense and showing the joy and that and everyone

00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:01.200
[Amit Varma]: can then relate to each other in a different way it's a lesson about discrimination in

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.560
[Amit Varma]: the most beautiful way because it's a lesson about the joy of diversity which is automatically

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:12.760
[Amit Varma]: an anti-discriminatory lesson right so that that's a lovely story here's my next a digressive

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:18.120
[Amit Varma]: question and obviously that cliche is of course true whatever you say about India the opposite

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:23.680
[Amit Varma]: is also true right so we are deeply illiberal in so many ways gender caste whatever but

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:30.880
[Amit Varma]: there is a lived liberalism which you can you know see in our languages in our cuisine

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:35.960
[Amit Varma]: and our clothes assimilations from everywhere and you've also spoke at the start of this

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:40.200
[Amit Varma]: conversation about how Maharashtra has had much older traditions in the RSS which go

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:46.760
[Amit Varma]: back which are syncretic tolerant which celebrate you know differences but here's the thing

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:52.120
[Amit Varma]: my sense and we were chatting about this at lunch and it's a theme I keep going back to

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:57.520
[Amit Varma]: is that if there is one way in which I have realized I was wrong about the world it is

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:03.040
[Amit Varma]: that you know growing up in my little elite English-speaking bubble I always thought that

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.640
[Amit Varma]: you know India is broadly tolerant we are liberal there are fringes but that's okay

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:13.280
[Amit Varma]: you know we are what we are and my sense and I can perhaps get too pessimistic about this

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:21.920
[Amit Varma]: is that no that you know we are the bubble and society is always been extremely illiberal

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.760
[Amit Varma]: and these strands that we see in political Hindutva today they're not recent they've

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:32.960
[Amit Varma]: been like I did an episode with Akshay Mukul on the Gita Press and all fantastic book and

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:40.600
[Amit Varma]: all of these issues from you know love jihad and cow protection and conversions all of

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:45.880
[Amit Varma]: these were live issues exactly a hundred years ago as well right and if you see sort of the

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:50.480
[Amit Varma]: sales of the books on the Gita Press including their manuals telling women how to behave

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:57.220
[Amit Varma]: and innocent in sanskari ways and so on and so forth you realize that this is a very big

00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:04.480
[Amit Varma]: in our society and therefore one begins to wonder about whether the experiment that we

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:10.440
[Amit Varma]: tried with the kind of constitution that we had was it bound to fail because what we seem

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:15.480
[Amit Varma]: to have done is we took a liberal constitution not as liberal as I would like but still much

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:20.960
[Amit Varma]: more liberal than society and imposed it on an illiberal society and assumed that the

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:26.120
[Amit Varma]: job was over that we are doing it top-down things will take care of themselves you know

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:30.720
[Amit Varma]: Madhav Khosla in a brilliant book an episode with me describes a constitution as a pedagogic

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:39.360
[Amit Varma]: exercise and it seems that politics has caught up with society and therefore where again

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.440
[Amit Varma]: I'd look pessimistically at what you said about at some point something's going to give

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:48.960
[Amit Varma]: at some you know I don't know if at some point something's going to give because the majority

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.840
[Amit Varma]: is having its way now who's going to do the rebelling it's not that society is being forced

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:58.520
[Amit Varma]: into a direction against its will or whatever you know this horrible direction that we are

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:03.920
[Amit Varma]: going in seems to be if the majority aren't actively clamoring for it they are perfectly

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:09.280
[Amit Varma]: content with it which is you know obviously it's a very pessimistic view and I know you're

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:16.320
[Amit Varma]: not so pessimistic so I mean what's what's your sense of this am I being too negative

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:22.320
[Guest]: no I just it's it's a it's a kind of expected question and it's a question that is that

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:27.120
[Guest]: needs to be asked if you like but I just would like to take a little bit of issue with say

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:32.480
[Guest]: the proposition that Madhav would make or whatever because I think it shows very little

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:39.160
[Guest]: regard for what went into the making of the constitution I mean to think that the constitution

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:44.040
[Guest]: or the constituent assembly debates that resulted in the constitution and to forget that the

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:49.560
[Guest]: constituent assembly debates had the partition bang in the middle of it and the fact that

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:55.040
[Guest]: the constitution actually emerged after the 150 175 years of the struggle against the

00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:01.680
[Guest]: British I think it really disregards the entire sacrifices or the pains of the national movement

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.920
[Guest]: against British colonialism so I just like to contest that very strongly because I think

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:12.080
[Guest]: to say that it was a pedagogic constitution is actually to disregard that the what I said

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:16.800
[Guest]: right in the beginning that the values that were thrown up from the freedom struggle from

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:22.160
[Guest]: the national movement also harked back to much earlier struggles but they coalesced

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:26.800
[Guest]: in a certain way and they represented a large and vast section of our people in fact I think

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:31.520
[Guest]: the problem is with liberals who think that we are the cocooned minority but I think the

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:37.560
[Guest]: vast vast vast section of these people of the people of this country have actually battled

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:42.840
[Guest]: inequality and oppression of various kinds under British rule and they actually were

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:48.360
[Guest]: part of the movement against the British so I want to repeat that and I think therefore

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:53.800
[Guest]: the values that were then sort of nichodoed and put into the constitution came as much

00:47:53.800 --> 00:48:00.280
[Guest]: from there as much as from the higher intellect as we like to think of it of people I mean

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:05.720
[Guest]: why was Babasaheb Ambedkar chosen I mean that question I think Madhav Goswami should also

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:12.040
[Guest]: answer because why was Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar a man a young man who when he was a young

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:22.400
[Guest]: boy of maybe 12 or 13 in the Elphinstone school Mumbai sitting in a classroom and a brilliant

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:31.640
[Guest]: mind and a maths problem is put to him and nobody in the class is able to answer and

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:36.200
[Guest]: he puts his hand up confidently and then the teacher is compelled to allow him to come

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:42.200
[Guest]: up to the blackboard to write down the five steps solution to the maths problem which

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:47.600
[Guest]: he does he solves it correctly and the attention of the class by the time he's reached the

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:52.760
[Guest]: last the answer is not on the fact that he's got it correct but the fact that a quote-unquote

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:58.000
[Guest]: untouchable has reached the blackboard because all their tiffin boxes are behind and therefore

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.800
[Guest]: they will not eat their food anymore because now it has been polluted now this is the man

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:11.200
[Guest]: chosen quote-unquote not chosen he's the man who obviously the person to write the constitution

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:16.880
[Guest]: and how can we therefore ever say that the majority of this country are sworn to a kind

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:22.160
[Guest]: of a majoritarian authoritarian deal no I think there is a certainly the subaltern there's

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:29.760
[Guest]: a whole section of the underbelly and that has grown from the meagre 0.5 or 10 percent

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:35.360
[Guest]: of the Jan Sangh once had to maybe even a 30 percent or 35 percent or 40 percent of

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:42.120
[Guest]: the population but I do not think that I will accept that it is a hundred percent what has

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:48.080
[Guest]: happened for sure is that the rest whether it is 20% or 60% we can argue numbers but

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:52.200
[Guest]: I think they have been silenced at various levels particularly the ones who are in a

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:58.040
[Guest]: position to speak one is a kind of a sense of self-preservation and fear that we would

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:03.960
[Guest]: not like to be the next persons who are a target whether it be through state agencies

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:09.440
[Guest]: or through any sort of vilification and there's a larger section our problem is the Indian

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:14.520
[Guest]: middle class which is just too obnoxiously large by world standards which actually does

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:19.320
[Guest]: not care one way or the other it does not care either whether we are going to be a democratic

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:24.160
[Guest]: constitutional state or an authoritarian state because it's navigating its life but they

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:28.680
[Guest]: are not the majority of the population they are obnoxiously large but they are not the

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:34.120
[Guest]: majority of the population so I think it's the fragmentation and the silencing which

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:40.000
[Guest]: is not letting the rest sort of come together in a way that would give hope to everybody

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.040
[Guest]: that something is happening if you are looking and working at the grassroots if you are looking

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:52.680
[Guest]: at the kind of the struggles in various parts of the country and there are myriads of them

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:57.120
[Guest]: I think one will realize that it's not an entirely hope it is fairly hopeless but not

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:02.320
[Guest]: entirely I'm not a stupid optimist but I'd also like to say that the hugest and biggest

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:08.360
[Guest]: abdication of the last decade and a half has been by the media and I think all of us in

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:12.160
[Guest]: some way or the other are products and have been associated with the media so I think

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:17.640
[Guest]: we need to understand what this means you know and I remember when I did these long

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:23.640
[Guest]: interviews with Sainath who's really interrogated this thing very very deeply and of course

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:29.240
[Guest]: there are many others that when you know he said it's not it's a kind of a triangle hold

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:38.040
[Guest]: on Indian democracy now through the corporatization of the media and the politicization party

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:44.500
[Guest]: politicization I mean media has to be political but you have if one party dominates the ownership

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:52.200
[Guest]: of the media and corporates and those same people are then now the dominant in Parliament

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:57.600
[Guest]: so then when he calculates like Sainath does that how many percentage of our parliamentarians

00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:03.840
[Guest]: are billionaires and which industries do they represent then it's mining telecom and television

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:12.680
[Guest]: companies so then you know that the digital communications industry your commercial television

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:17.880
[Guest]: and your political representation is all the same and therefore you're unlikely to see

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:23.480
[Guest]: a debate happening there on what you were talking about which is a homogenized banana

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:30.680
[Guest]: or the rice varieties which are being completely finished off because of the kind of priorities

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:36.640
[Guest]: we are giving to agriculture forget a lynching or a Mohammed Clark you won't even have a

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:44.360
[Guest]: debate on homogenization of agriculture because it's not in the interest of you know the section

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:48.720
[Guest]: that would benefit from this homogenization who are sitting in Parliament to do that so

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:53.520
[Guest]: actually therefore we are talking about as in when and if the resistance happens in our

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:58.480
[Guest]: lifetime and I hope it does even if it doesn't seem very imminent is that you really need

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:04.320
[Guest]: to be looking at electoral reform judicial reform media ownership changes you know so

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:10.400
[Guest]: you need to look we need to look at judicial reform court and you need to look at so many

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:15.200
[Guest]: things being turned on their head which is like individual and collective struggles that

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:21.000
[Guest]: encompass all of this and is that feasible is that happening can it happen is of course

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.160
[Guest]: seems so overwhelming that we most of the time feel it cannot happen I mean just look

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:29.800
[Guest]: at what the election commission is doing look at the electoral bonds issue I mean it's so

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:36.400
[Guest]: brazenly non-transparent it is brazenly non-transparent you know and then therefore there's inordinate

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:40.320
[Guest]: hope that is required from the judiciary and will the supreme court cope therefore these

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:44.120
[Guest]: debates on who the next chief justice is going to be so all of this is we are looking at

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:49.800
[Guest]: these one two three places for us to get manners from heaven and to get solutions from them

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:53.400
[Guest]: all of this can only happen if there are these myriad struggles that are constantly pushing

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:59.000
[Guest]: these institutions to answer and many more people who are willing from the political

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:05.320
[Guest]: opposition to not say Lakshmi and Ganesh on the vote but to actually say we are prepared

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:11.060
[Guest]: to go to jail and let's flood our jails with the opposition doesn't matter if you want

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:14.800
[Guest]: to do it but we are going to raise some inconvenient questions we are going to raise questions

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:19.280
[Guest]: of the lynching of minorities the lynching of Dalits the attacks on girls in Uttar Pradesh

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:24.720
[Guest]: we are going to raise these issues even if it's inconvenient so there is a sense of despair

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:31.320
[Guest]: because of the quiet we see but I think we need to start looking for constructive noise

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:36.760
[Amit Varma]: and constructive struggles so we will talk about each of these one by one as we go along

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:41.800
[Amit Varma]: in the conversation but first there is a book by Rohit Dey called the People's Constitution

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:46.360
[Amit Varma]: which makes exactly that point that these are not just imported values these are lived

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:52.720
[Amit Varma]: values and they reflect in people's struggles in different ways let me ask you sort of my

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:57.520
[Amit Varma]: final digressive question before we get back to our chronological narrative of your growing

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:02.800
[Amit Varma]: up and your family and all of that and this one nicely segues into that because you know

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:08.040
[Amit Varma]: you said a little earlier that you were almost sort of the ninth lawyer in the family down

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:15.640
[Amit Varma]: the family line and all of that and it would seem to me that in one way you are doing exactly

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:20.760
[Amit Varma]: the same thing or working in exactly the same spirit as your grandfather and as his father

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:27.720
[Amit Varma]: before him in the sense that they were using their skills to work for a better society

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:33.920
[Amit Varma]: in the role that most made sense to them at the time right so flush after independence

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:39.240
[Amit Varma]: for example your granddad M.C. Settlebarth first attorney general it would have seemed

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:45.480
[Amit Varma]: that yeah I know the law this is independent India needs people like me and that is what

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:52.600
[Amit Varma]: an idealist would do and we find over time that that idealism and that hope in the in

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:59.120
[Amit Varma]: the virtues of the state have kind of vanished that we are faced with a much starker reality

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:03.000
[Amit Varma]: and it might and and you would obviously you don't know whether it's true or not but I

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.080
[Amit Varma]: imagine if your grandfather was born when you were he might have gone down on the kind

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:13.960
[Amit Varma]: of line that you did because you can't anymore make a better society in that way from within

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:20.480
[Amit Varma]: the system because it'll just corrode you and it'll eat you up and in a sense if you

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:28.400
[Amit Varma]: you know want to go down those paths you end up like your root in that sense feels natural

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:33.280
[Amit Varma]: like on one hand and and and that's you know a separate side question that how do we become

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:38.200
[Amit Varma]: what we become how much of it is contingent and how much of it is has something to do

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:43.680
[Amit Varma]: with our essential nature and on the one hand it might seem contingent different things

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:47.760
[Amit Varma]: happen you know your first journalism job you're covering those riots you're covering

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:52.680
[Amit Varma]: criminal violence on one hand it might seem contingent but on the other hand in these

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:58.120
[Amit Varma]: times what else could you have been is another question that comes to my mind yeah actually

00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:02.920
[Guest]: that's interesting this I was just rereading my grandfather's autobiography my life law

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:08.040
[Guest]: and other things and there's a very interesting chapter in it on the Mundra scandal which

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:14.080
[Guest]: was the independent India's first huge financial scam and scandal and he was Attorney General

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:20.320
[Guest]: at the time and the fact that and the whole question of autonomy of autonomy of opposition

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.640
[Guest]: if I look at today with the Attorney General I mean today we have a very decent Attorney

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:28.240
[Guest]: General after many years but look at how the Solicitor General is functioning today it's

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:32.040
[Guest]: so crude you know apart from anything and so it tells you a little bit about how these

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:39.680
[Guest]: institutions need to function because he narrates it was the Chagla MC Chagla the Doan was appointed

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:44.120
[Guest]: as Commissioner into the scandal and he was representing the government government as

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:48.480
[Guest]: in state not in government in power so he and he had made that very clear and the entire

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:52.560
[Guest]: proceedings were in our city which is the old town hall where now the Director General

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:57.480
[Guest]: of Police sits and it was hugely attended by the public Chagla had taken the decision

00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:01.440
[Guest]: that it'll be open and of course Settelbad was arguing and that all these evidence was

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:06.280
[Guest]: coming etc and the very interesting passages from there because obviously the dispensation

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:13.400
[Guest]: and that was our first Prime Minister highly regarded and it was about the LIC scam LIC

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:19.560
[Guest]: investing out of turn more than a crore of its capital on in private enterprise when

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:24.360
[Guest]: it should could not have done that without under the act under which it was formed and

00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:29.840
[Guest]: without consulting its shareholders which is the public so anyway so of course the stand

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:34.280
[Guest]: that my grandfather took and then the praise he got from the newspapers and all of that

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:39.560
[Guest]: and obviously dispensation was not happy and including the Prime Minister was not very

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:44.400
[Guest]: happy with the kind of independence stand he took yet after the whole thing got over

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:50.040
[Guest]: and the T Krishnamachari was compelled to resign after the Finance Minister so it was

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:54.920
[Guest]: like a huge thing internationally as well he described the first visit to the prior

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:58.960
[Guest]: Nehru's residence after dinner because there were a lot of rumors that now Settelbad will

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:05.000
[Guest]: resign because he was Attorney General for about 12 years because the government is unhappy

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.960
[Guest]: with him and I think Nehru went out of his way apart from anything else to say that that

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:14.280
[Guest]: is not what he intended at all though he was upset at the time so it's both things you

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:18.600
[Guest]: see you see the fact that yes there was this tension and the tension was unfortunate and

00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:23.600
[Guest]: should not have happened that you saw the Finance Secretary and the Home and the Finance

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:28.000
[Guest]: Minister and the State Bank Chairperson and the RBI Chairperson behaving in ways they

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:33.560
[Guest]: shouldn't have but you equally saw the Attorney General and MC Chagla and others functioning

00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:38.280
[Guest]: above I mean beyond par you know and then he writes there that then you know after that

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:45.000
[Guest]: he talks about his father Sir Chimanlal Settelbad who my great-grandfather went because he cross

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.080
[Guest]: examined Dyer in the Hunter Commission and because of it that but for me it was so important

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:54.880
[Guest]: also to see about Chimanlal and this I'm hoping that his autobiography we are reprinting now

00:59:54.880 --> 01:00:01.280
[Guest]: my as well because if people demanded but it's out of print is that he was a close colleague

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:08.560
[Guest]: of Babasaheb Ambedkar and in 1924 Chimanlal was president of what is called the Bahishket

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:16.520
[Guest]: Hithkarni Sabha which was formed with the aim of ensuring the construction of 124 hostels

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.520
[Guest]: for Dalit girls and boys because the whole understanding being that you know they're

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:25.280
[Guest]: left out they can't stay there because only residential colleges are possible so we must

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:30.720
[Guest]: have this and it's not just Chimanlal the entire trust the board of that was one Parsi

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:36.280
[Guest]: one Jew so different castes and communities recognizing the vision of Ambedkar of course

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.600
[Guest]: this is the tradition one has grown up very proudly with and knew about this but I was

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:46.280
[Guest]: very personally it was sort of assumed that I would be the one we are just two sisters

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.200
[Guest]: I would be the one who does law because my sister was not particularly interested I was

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:56.080
[Guest]: always very interested in the law and current affairs and everything but I mean 12th standard

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:00.120
[Guest]: changed all that 7th standard changed all that when I was about 12 years old when I

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:04.080
[Guest]: just a book that my father bought me actually all the precedence men and I said no I just

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:09.320
[Guest]: have to do journalism and I told him that one day in one of our myriad discussions and

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:14.560
[Guest]: arguments that I want to now do journalism I remember he didn't say a word he didn't

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.000
[Guest]: even say that there was no pressure no pressure at all he just sort of kept quiet for a few

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.640
[Guest]: minutes and then he said you have to do what you are most happy doing and I think that

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:28.680
[Guest]: feeling of being brought up in that sort of environment where you had a father who asked

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:33.360
[Guest]: him to call him by his first name he never asked us to call him father or papa or daddy

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:39.040
[Guest]: or whatever we always called him Atul both of us and he was very comfortable with two

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:44.680
[Guest]: girl children I think my mother probably wanted a son but because there were two miscarriages

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:49.080
[Guest]: after my younger sister but I don't think he was at all at all concerned that he didn't

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:55.480
[Guest]: have a son I think this also gets allows a lot of self-confidence to grow so then you

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.520
[Guest]: not only decide to take on a profession which is not this thing but you also ask questions

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.280
[Guest]: of your father who's told you once that don't study your kundra and your history textbook

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.440
[Guest]: read the history from your library that you're lucky enough to have because he had a huge

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:13.240
[Guest]: personal library of history and stuff then I would ask him but why do you have more Nehru

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:17.560
[Guest]: and Gandhi and Patel and why don't you have Avinash Ambedkar and Phule moment I was in

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:22.320
[Guest]: junior college so all that questioning and turning would begin your political my own

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.760
[Guest]: politicization in in Elphinstone College which again I chose because my father and grandfather

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.520
[Guest]: and had gone to that college so there was this thing of always being proud of that tradition

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:38.480
[Guest]: but also also being quite self-assured about questioning it and taking a different path

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.160
[Guest]: and I think that is also probably comes from that upbringing upbringing but of course you're

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:50.200
[Guest]: also your own person so even as a reporter I covered the courts immediately after doing

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:55.280
[Guest]: my university beat and political beat I was very keen on legal reportage and coverage

01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.840
[Guest]: legal analysis of judgments so I think there was the attraction of the law and understanding

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:05.120
[Guest]: it or try to deconstruct it didn't ever go away though of course one was looking at it

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:12.480
[Guest]: from a different prism than a practicing lawyer you know and but I still will see and maybe

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.800
[Guest]: then you want to ask you something more is that I still have had the good fortune of

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:24.240
[Guest]: it through my work coming across a wide spectrum of lawyers who are existing in today's much

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:30.720
[Guest]: more difficult system than it would have been for my grandfather or my father and great

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.040
[Guest]: grandfather also that and we're doing such a fine dignified job of it you know and it

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:41.720
[Guest]: must be so much harder because we are facing a very viciously reprisal oriented government

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:48.600
[Guest]: and yet they they just carry on at great personal risk and displaying huge moral courage so

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:55.040
[Guest]: yeah maybe that's the trajectory I took but I'm so glad that there are lawyers within

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.280
[Guest]: in in our courts whether it is Gujarat High Court whether it is Bombay High Court whether

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:05.360
[Guest]: it is Delhi Supreme Court who are still there to be able to take up the causes that we all

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:11.280
[Amit Varma]: of us collectively espouse. What did your father feel of the work that you did like

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.160
[Amit Varma]: you've mentioned that in your book you've spoken about how he'd give you strength before

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.560
[Amit Varma]: he passed in 2010 that he was supportive and all of that but in general as your career

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:26.600
[Amit Varma]: took the parts that it did you know your 10 years as a full-time journalist 83 to 93 and

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:33.360
[Amit Varma]: then after the activism kind of happened did all of it feel like this is a natural flow

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:41.080
[Amit Varma]: of things that this is what she you know this is who she is. He was hugely supportive of

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.880
[Guest]: both me and Javed because both of us worked so much together my partner Javed Anand and

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.760
[Guest]: me very supportive of the work when we decided to quit journalism start formal mainstream

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:55.720
[Guest]: journalism and start Communalism Combat which was also an iconic magazine for the longest

01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:03.600
[Guest]: time August 93 was our first issue and November 2012 was our last issue now we are online

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.360
[Guest]: he was very supportive but I think there was also a sense that maybe you know worry and

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:15.200
[Guest]: concern that maybe she's going too far and maybe she's challenging a system which cannot

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.880
[Guest]: stomach so much challenge there was also that sense of concern and fear as he grew older

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:24.920
[Guest]: he was also sick at the end of it so I think he was also very very worried so I remember

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:32.840
[Guest]: particularly from June this year to September when I was so wrongfully confined and in jail

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:35.920
[Guest]: one of the thoughts that used to come in I said that you know I never wanted him to go

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:41.720
[Guest]: so early but but I'm glad he's not there because I don't think he would have been able to handle

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:47.040
[Guest]: that you know the way in which I was picked up and the way the vilification has been happening

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.200
[Guest]: would have been really too much for him because he really believed in a different India where

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:56.920
[Guest]: the system cannot be he really believed that the system and the state cannot be so vile

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.440
[Guest]: and that's how it's become it's vile now so I think that is something which would have

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:05.680
[Guest]: been at a war within himself because he was from that generation that believed that the

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:11.720
[Guest]: that the state and the courts and the system will not reach that degenerate you know so

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:16.200
[Guest]: there's always that thing I keep thinking when I think of him though he was a huge huge

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:21.200
[Guest]: support I think was also a huge sense of worry he had and that you know where is this going

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.400
[Guest]: to take her.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:28.760
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned your your grandfather's encounter with Mr. Nehru and how you know your grandfather

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:34.360
[Amit Varma]: did the right thing and Nehru did the right thing and they were both in that sense upstanding

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:40.880
[Amit Varma]: but my sense always has been that you know you might be lucky at a particular point in

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:45.600
[Amit Varma]: time that you have people of great character but you cannot rely on that a well-designed

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:50.920
[Amit Varma]: system is a system that will function even if you have the worst possible people in charge

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:56.760
[Amit Varma]: and it is clear that our system is not a well-designed system it's you know it's too top-heavy too

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:01.400
[Amit Varma]: much power to the state and sort of in a sense the scales have fallen from our eyes over

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:06.920
[Amit Varma]: the decades you know my dad was an IAS officer as well and when he speaks about the idealism

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:12.280
[Amit Varma]: with he and his batchmates all joined and you know I think back on that and I'm like

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:16.880
[Amit Varma]: you know how could you be so idealistic right and today it's easy to say that in hindsight

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:22.000
[Amit Varma]: when you've seen what the state has become but the point is that that was never really

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.600
[Amit Varma]: going to last and even in your book all your actions represent a great faith in the rule

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:34.480
[Amit Varma]: of law a great faith that no justice will be done and we have to keep fighting for it

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:40.960
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth there are parts including in your book where you seem to show a sort

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:45.800
[Amit Varma]: of despair about where the system is like I'll quote this bit which I found very resonant

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.880
[Amit Varma]: where you write quote there is a lesson to be learned in the struggle for justice the

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:54.560
[Amit Varma]: system that loves the status quo tolerates interventions up to a point but appears to

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:59.640
[Amit Varma]: fall short of delivering radical real or substantive justice the system engages with the survivors

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:04.280
[Amit Varma]: and defenders in the early years but a shake-up of the status quo demands an exceptional judicial

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:09.760
[Amit Varma]: mind if survivors and defenders labor on for decades 15 years as we have done if we tried

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:14.960
[Amit Varma]: and take it beyond the small fry offenders somehow the system to keep us in check makes

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:21.540
[Amit Varma]: us pay stop code and then you went on to elaborate on this and it just seems to me and I of course

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:28.440
[Amit Varma]: tend to be too cynical but it just seems to me that that that ultimately all these institutions

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:33.960
[Amit Varma]: will be co-opted you know because just look at the incentives in play of course the judiciary

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:39.280
[Amit Varma]: will be co-opted of course the attorney general will be like a lawyer for the party in power

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:46.040
[Amit Varma]: you know of course all of this will happen everything will kind of crumble and and yet

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:52.120
[Amit Varma]: you keep fighting and placing your faith in this system and you know you continue that

01:08:52.120 --> 01:09:00.680
[Amit Varma]: journey so tell me a bit about how do you reconcile these two like for your father for

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:06.360
[Amit Varma]: example was you mentioned that it was sad for him to see that the state could become

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:13.640
[Amit Varma]: this was so did you see that disillusionment creeping in him did you feel that it hurt

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:20.520
[Amit Varma]: him that in in some senses you know it's like Santa Claus doesn't exist and and and and

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:27.800
[Amit Varma]: for you did you also have moments of doubt where you said what is the point it's pointless

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:35.000
[Amit Varma]: you know like you know how how was that for you see when you're in a struggle and the

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.760
[Guest]: struggle keeps changing forms and needs to also adapt strategies and take new strategies

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:48.120
[Guest]: it's not always you can't always predict the path that the struggle will take I feel that

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.920
[Guest]: when you're when you're in the midst of the struggle and it's by no means over when it

01:09:50.920 --> 01:10:02.280
[Guest]: comes to me or us none of it is over I think the question is also one of what is the option

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.200
[Guest]: what is the option once you're in the midst of it even if I were to allow myself to think

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.800
[Guest]: what is the point like you said or should I give up is that is that is that an option

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:19.120
[Guest]: at all because you're not representing only yourself you're not representing only an individual

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:25.520
[Guest]: maverick attempt it is part of a collective process that has metamorphosed into something

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:33.000
[Guest]: okay so can you just give it up even if you even if you feel more you're a more real person

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.320
[Guest]: now you're more grounded than when you began in terms of the experience of the system you're

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.960
[Guest]: more cynical even can you afford to give up that that's one question I'm placing on the

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:49.000
[Guest]: table secondly I think you also realize that there are different ways you can take the

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.920
[Guest]: same struggle forward okay which is that yes even if you look at certain aspects of say

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:02.560
[Guest]: targeted killings and communal violence and the accountability we demanded from the state

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:07.400
[Guest]: through a battle in the courts which was very rigorously fought and unfortunately was not

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:12.560
[Guest]: echoed by a political battle by the opposition of the same kind because that that's also

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:17.320
[Guest]: what I say in my book that when when the battle against proto-fascism gets limited to a battle

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:22.200
[Guest]: in the courts there is no way you're going to win it okay so that that is also a story

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:28.200
[Guest]: which needs to be that's also a strand that needs to be explored in our conversation that

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:34.080
[Guest]: why is the political opposition so wary about looking at some of these tumultuous issues

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:39.560
[Guest]: as part of election campaign hearing till that happens till we met can that ever happen

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:44.360
[Guest]: till we metamorphose into that South Africa did happen many many countries we've seen

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:49.320
[Guest]: those language of electoral politics take the language of a of an emancipatory struggle

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:54.280
[Guest]: whether it is a question of rights of Adivasis or the rights of minorities or targeted killings

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.720
[Guest]: that's not happened in our country yet even right to education does not figure as an election

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:04.040
[Guest]: manifest to battle so the issue is not just about these are settled word in the courts

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:09.000
[Guest]: or whatever it is about the issue the issue is okay you're trying to demand accountability

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.240
[Guest]: and transparency in heinous targeted killings based on hate speech and hate violence through

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:19.800
[Guest]: the courts courts have a certain conservative structure they're not diverse they're not

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:26.040
[Guest]: accountable they're appointed we all know that they're top-heavy they take too long

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:32.560
[Guest]: all of that can the battle ever be one only there yet if you look at what happened in

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:40.160
[Guest]: Gujarat 2002 even now with all the setbacks the kind of convictions we got has unprecedented

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:46.000
[Guest]: compared to 84, 92, 93, Meerut, Maliana what I'm trying to say is that and the question

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.160
[Guest]: you earlier raised which we didn't fully I didn't fully answer is that you know the post

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.640
[Guest]: independence what this what was expected of the state and what was expected of society

01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:02.060
[Guest]: I think the state did some of it but not enough what this you mentioned about Nehru did the

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:06.960
[Guest]: decent thing he did a decent thing that one time about Mundrabad if you read Nehru and

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:10.760
[Guest]: the anonymous column he used to write in the statesman he said that I'm becoming more and

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:15.640
[Guest]: more dictatorial because there's nobody to question me in my cabinet and he then the

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:21.160
[Guest]: way he proceeded and you see a certain degeneration and you see whether whether it is inducting

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:27.560
[Guest]: family or whatever it is and the disrespect for federalism and I think that is the important

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:32.440
[Guest]: thing about the constitution which again has not been understood that it's a unity but

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:36.920
[Guest]: federal structure and we are seeing this noise is coming from the south we are seeing DMK

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:41.360
[Guest]: make that noise in a very considered way we are seeing the Kerala make that noise now

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:46.360
[Guest]: whether it'll be effective or not but it's a battle it's and eventually we are 75, 76

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:52.480
[Guest]: years down look at other democracies and how they've evolved is democracy the best way

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:59.880
[Guest]: even history will tell us that but but it has taken 200, 150 years for capitalist entrenched

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:05.600
[Guest]: democracies to even get their quote-unquote institutions to a level at which when Trump

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:10.360
[Guest]: is trying to capture that election which one and a half years back you have election officers

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.360
[Guest]: many of them women saying no the last vote will be counted you know which given America's

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.800
[Guest]: foreign policy is no great deal because they massacred people all over the world but at

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:23.640
[Guest]: least as far as that institution is concerned it gave me a lot of hope you know so I'm just

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:31.960
[Guest]: saying that it's a very complex battle that we are fighting it's a battle to deepen the

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:38.040
[Guest]: institutions of governance of democracy in this country to yet our structure of our society

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:45.760
[Guest]: and state is very very casteist classist and feudal or we did not allow the structures

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:54.760
[Guest]: of state to get you know to have representation as they ought to have had from the sections

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:59.760
[Guest]: that needed the most and deserve it the most in terms of if lived democracy had to come

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:07.960
[Guest]: in anytime any Dalit intellectual talks about and the issue of Dalit representation in the

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:13.720
[Guest]: higher judiciary they're shot down but it's a very valid question Dalit representation

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:19.320
[Guest]: gender representation minority representation why can't we raise it because it's a fact

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:25.560
[Guest]: that it's only when those representations come that you will have a sense of your responding

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.840
[Guest]: and I don't think it's about just identity politics it should be about workers about

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:34.760
[Guest]: farmers do we have farmers as judges workers as judges teachers as judges you know it's

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.200
[Guest]: all of these kind of cross intersectionalities that we need to think so I know I've gone

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:44.240
[Guest]: all over the place but what I'm trying to say is that the battle for accountability and

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:51.120
[Guest]: transparency the battle for from the state certainly can be more successful in the courts

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:55.920
[Guest]: if the courts are more accountable and I'm not running away from that question but it

01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.440
[Guest]: cannot only be fought there it just cannot only be fought there and when we're looking

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:05.720
[Guest]: at communal violence or targeted violence against sections of ethnic populations caste

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:11.000
[Guest]: or community it is a kind of a I mean it's a historical reprisal as the section sees

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.840
[Guest]: it for what happened in partition and and that also shows a lack of understanding of

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:19.840
[Guest]: history because in partition itself if you look at the map of India and I'm sure you

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.520
[Guest]: if you taught history you do the same thing I'll teach history that way that you know

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:28.000
[Guest]: you look at it from the east to the west and if you look at the trajectory that maybe in

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.280
[Guest]: Bengal you had no Akali and Hindus were massacred most but in Bihar it was large sections of

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:38.360
[Guest]: the Muslims and in Punjab it was the Sikhs so it is everybody it is it's three communities

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:44.680
[Guest]: doing it to each other pretty much playing it out and that demon of communal politics

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:48.800
[Guest]: that actually sits within all communities and which at one stage you're a majority another

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:53.760
[Guest]: stage you're a minority is what we need to tackle that that's the hate politics that

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.880
[Guest]: we need to tackle and there's a danger of it becoming majoritarianism when it's Hindu

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:04.560
[Guest]: were here but equally Islamization in Pakistan or the Buddhist state in Sri Lanka so that

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:08.480
[Guest]: understanding we need to get among our people which means a strain of rationality and a

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:15.560
[Guest]: strain of questioning and the right wing the supremacist right wing is better organized

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:22.320
[Guest]: it's it has had its gold in fact it made it clear when it assassinated Gandhiji and that

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.360
[Guest]: was in fact my the first book I edited I don't know if you've seen it it's called beyond

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:30.280
[Guest]: doubt because I mean for me it was an eye-opener when Jagan Farnes's book I read in Marathi

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:38.520
[Guest]: in 1998 where I first as a student of history first his book was called Mahatmanji Akher

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:43.440
[Guest]: and he first wrote and it was his original work that there were five attempts on Gandhi

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.440
[Guest]: before before the last one that successfully killed him and this is not part of the dominant

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:51.680
[Guest]: narrative even now I have to keep telling people that did you know that there were six

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:56.200
[Guest]: attempts totally with a six was successful and in three previous attempts Godse was part

01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:01.200
[Guest]: of it so it was not a spontaneous act it was pretty organized pretty well thought out and

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:08.400
[Guest]: all of it so I just feel it's all of this coming together let's look at the world the

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:13.680
[Guest]: world is also going very right has gone very right so it's not just an Indian phenomenon

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:18.960
[Guest]: there's a grappling all along and so much has to do with economic structures and you

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:25.920
[Guest]: know the the kind of path of neo-liberalization neo-globalization that the world took which

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:30.880
[Guest]: is now being questioned at some level if you look at South America and some of the states

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:35.560
[Guest]: there but have we reached a state where we are questioning it I don't think so because

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.240
[Guest]: if you look at what we are doing with the forest conservation rules what we're looking

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:42.720
[Guest]: at the kind of model of development so you know for civil rights activists also like

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.400
[Guest]: me we have to develop our understanding of economics and what kind of priorities because

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:54.200
[Guest]: I'm keen on reaching and discussing with the people who feel today that they are jobless

01:18:54.200 --> 01:19:00.240
[Guest]: and hopeless and therefore they can sit and watch propaganda videos we need to reach those

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:04.760
[Guest]: people because they are the same people who supported Trump you know it's it's the white

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.760
[Guest]: American workforce that supported Trump and I think if that white American workforce is

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:14.880
[Guest]: feeling completely isolated and without job I cannot say that we can't speak to them I

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:19.560
[Guest]: cannot say this this is them it's not a them it's a it's a them which is being pulled there

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:24.520
[Guest]: because of a certain economic reality you know so it's a huge challenge for all of us

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:30.120
[Guest]: who are trying to work at the people's level at the struggle level at mass organization

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:37.080
[Guest]: at building up a political opposition we it we all realize also that we have to work with

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:41.640
[Guest]: the opposition we've got it's not going to radically change the way we want it to so

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:46.320
[Guest]: how do we make that happen how do we work with it you know these are all all very complicated

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:50.920
[Guest]: questions and then it boils down to okay what is your struggle and what is your choice and

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:54.040
[Guest]: do you stop what you're doing what you're doing and then I think the option is not there

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:59.720
[Guest]: to stop maybe you take a break take a different path for a little while but I mean for instance

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:04.360
[Guest]: I just wanted to share that apart from the school program the work we're doing in Assam

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:07.880
[Guest]: at the moment I don't know if you're aware of it it is looking at the law on citizenship

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:16.760
[Guest]: and the way it's rendering millions of Indians genuine Indian citizens a civil death because

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:21.800
[Guest]: that's what it is you suddenly wake up and say that you know Amit is not an Indian Tista

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:26.120
[Guest]: is not an Indian and then I have to just scramble around putting together documents to prove

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:29.960
[Guest]: my citizenship which is not even required under the Indian constitution and we have

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:35.880
[Guest]: a team there CJ my organization has been working there since for the last seven years local

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:42.840
[Guest]: team diverse gender diverse ethnic diverse working in villages and we're ensuring paralegal

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:48.040
[Guest]: and legal aid now according to me that's if that's a that's a follow-up trajectory to

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:52.600
[Guest]: what the kind of work we've done before with targeted violence that you're using the law

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:59.640
[Guest]: bottom up from the foreigner tribunal level up to the supreme court not just going straight

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:04.760
[Guest]: when there's an incident of mass violence but this is an everyday annihilation of the

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:10.040
[Guest]: people you know just rendering them completely non-citizens and I think therefore we it's

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:16.200
[Guest]: like using your previous expertise in a way where a huge humanitarian crisis is brewing

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:20.840
[Guest]: and when I was in jail and I found and this is what I like to just share with your viewers that

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:25.480
[Guest]: for a person who has never been looked at herself as an individual but part of a collective battle

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.480
[Guest]: to feel that the kind of organization building that my CJP has done and that we have now

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:34.360
[Guest]: teams working in Assam we have a team working in Purvanchal and we keep telling our supporters that

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:40.120
[Guest]: you know these are the teams we need to support it's not a thista or a individual but human rights

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:46.040
[Guest]: workers and peace workers on the ground who are able to take up these little and bigger challenges

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:52.520
[Amit Varma]: and that's when the change will happen. So I share your lament about the one point of failure in all

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:57.720
[Amit Varma]: this which is politics which is the opposition right and my question is about that now this

01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:02.680
[Amit Varma]: this seems to be an assumption on the part of all the opposition parties

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:09.080
[Amit Varma]: that you cannot mess with the Hindu vote so in some way or the other they will try to you know

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:14.040
[Amit Varma]: cater to it maybe in the very crude ways that Kejriwal is doing that you put pictures of

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:19.480
[Amit Varma]: goddesses on banknotes or even earlier when the Babri Masjid judgment came you know Priyanka Gandhi

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:25.400
[Amit Varma]: boasted that hey my father opened the gates of the Babri Masjid there is this sense that you

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:31.960
[Amit Varma]: have to in some way show religiosity and so on and they seem to be making the assumption that ties

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:38.280
[Amit Varma]: in with my sort of pessimistic speculation earlier that this is what society is like politics has

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:44.200
[Amit Varma]: caught up with it and they seem to be treating it as a non-negotiable now is it the case that they

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:50.760
[Amit Varma]: are on to something or is it the case that there is a lack of imagination there that there are

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:56.600
[Amit Varma]: other margins on which you can appeal to people it's you know we all contain multitudes even if

01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:02.520
[Amit Varma]: even if it is the case that religiosity matters even if it is a case that there is a certain

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:09.480
[Amit Varma]: shared bigotry there there are surely other margins that you can also appeal on and you know

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:15.480
[Amit Varma]: but this is a battle everyone's just turned their back on so you know so it's that why which I'm

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:23.000
[Amit Varma]: trying to understand that are our parties are these opposition parties on to something about

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:29.800
[Amit Varma]: our society which you know may give you and I this quiet and we may not want to accept it or

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:35.800
[Amit Varma]: are they just showing a lack of imagination that there is a space to fight extraordinarily

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:41.960
[Guest]: important question you know I can't tell you how important it is and I'll try and just do some

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:47.880
[Guest]: justice to it see I you know it boils down again to this I mean I like the way you put it that is

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:53.160
[Guest]: there a lack of imagination I think there is a lack of imagination if I believe as a as a Rahul

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:59.560
[Guest]: Gandhi or a Krijiwal or a Mamata or whatever if I believe that this is where society is that this is

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:05.880
[Guest]: there's actually everybody has now always been or has become so divided and so polarized that that's

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:13.000
[Guest]: the only language I can speak then I will keep perpetuating this lack of imagine but if I actually

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:19.960
[Guest]: and I think that's the other problem that if you look at the election figures of number of people

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:25.880
[Guest]: who don't vote I think that's a figure that really important to look at it tells a very

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:30.360
[Guest]: despairing tale it means a lot of people are just so disillusioned with what's being offered it's

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:34.600
[Guest]: not that they're going to this or that they just seem we don't want to vote okay then if you put

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:38.520
[Guest]: it together with those who are not voting for this regime I think the figure is pretty large

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:45.400
[Guest]: pretty large so I think it's lack of imagination to first say that it's lack of imagination and

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:51.000
[Guest]: that lack of imagination is not simply from what the way you put it that go to other issues I think

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.880
[Guest]: the other issues must be gone too whether it's unemployment or prices and all but I think it's

01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:01.720
[Guest]: also about tackling diversity and secularism head-on and there I want to hark on something

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.960
[Guest]: which is something that people don't want to talk about which is that how did Javed and I start the

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:13.160
[Guest]: work we did from about 1986 onwards 93 we began combat formally but actually this whole turning

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:19.320
[Guest]: began in around 1986 I don't even know you were born then but it was a very incredibly

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:25.320
[Guest]: critical period for India I was a teenager then I'm just joking thank you for that

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:31.080
[Guest]: very critical period for India very critical period for India because you saw so many things

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:39.880
[Guest]: happening at the same time and if I just want to encapsulate those two three were one was of

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:45.960
[Guest]: course we you you referred to it opening what Priyanka said opening of the talas of the Babri

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:54.280
[Guest]: Masjid but not as as important was the reaction of the Muslim male clergy to the Shabano judgment

01:25:54.280 --> 01:26:00.600
[Guest]: okay now this was within weeks of each other both happening within weeks of each other and we saw

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:08.520
[Guest]: as young journalists we saw that what awful effect it was having on the ground because the VHP

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:14.680
[Guest]: VHP had made this the Babri the construction of the Ram Mandir their program from 86 onwards

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:21.400
[Guest]: BJP adopted it a year or two later but the Shabanu judgment was like a manner from heaven for the

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:27.400
[Guest]: right for the Hindutva right because the manner in which not just the Muslim male clergy reacted

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:32.920
[Guest]: but the manner in which India's centrist party reacted which is the congress was was horrendous

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:38.040
[Guest]: instead of negotiating and navigating with the vast majority of India's Muslims

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:43.960
[Guest]: which includes its women you know they were negotiating with just a top heavy clergy

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:48.680
[Guest]: and the response they were getting in terms of the shouting and the hordes and the slogan

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:54.840
[Guest]: hearing was confirmed to that middle road a Hindu who had not gone over to that side

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.560
[Guest]: that yes this is a section that wants special treatment under the law and wants is not even

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:04.840
[Guest]: prepared to give 125 rupees for an old woman who's been divorced what does this mean you saw

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:11.720
[Guest]: minority communalism feeding into majority communalism exactly what led me to do so much

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:17.400
[Guest]: reading of my history pre-partition and I teach it now in the class to the 8, 9, 10 standards junior

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:25.160
[Guest]: colleges that we have to understand the trajectory of this country between 1857 1847 to 1933 and then

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:35.960
[Guest]: 1947 why till 1925 did you not see the emergence of these sectarian forces from both sides and then

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:42.360
[Guest]: what happens between 1925 and 1937 when you first have the Muslim League pass up a Lahore resolution

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:49.880
[Guest]: you know to believe for anybody to any critical thinker in India to believe that secularism can

01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:58.360
[Guest]: only be two things that secularism can only be a battle to for Hindus to become liberal and to

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:03.640
[Guest]: Hindus to battle caste and that minority should not be touched I think it's not to understand

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:10.040
[Guest]: what secularization of society means number one and I think number two is not to understand that

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:15.800
[Guest]: historically this has always played up that minority communalism has played into majority

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:20.600
[Guest]: communalism and whereas of course I agree with Nehru when he said that majority communalism is

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:26.680
[Guest]: endangers the state because the structure of the state changes what happens to society when minority

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:31.560
[Guest]: communalism is given a free hand and is not tackled is that it's three or four things first of all you

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:37.080
[Guest]: don't give agency to the moderate liberal dissenting voices among Muslims you don't allow that

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:42.600
[Guest]: you don't allow that leadership to emerge and you ignore the Muslim women completely you know

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.920
[Guest]: and can you imagine something more horrific than the fact that it's under this regime that an issue

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:51.800
[Guest]: like talaq is raised when organizations like the Indian Muslim for Secular Democracy which my husband

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:59.160
[Guest]: partner represents has been talking against triple talaq polygamy and halal for like two decades

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:05.320
[Guest]: and yet you know the it's just completely ignored by mainstream politicians so this lack of

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:11.320
[Guest]: imagination encompasses even this that what is secularism secularism is not about giving Friday

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:17.080
[Guest]: holidays to Muslims or to give the prophets birthday as a holiday to Muslims that's not what

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:22.440
[Guest]: the vast majority of Indian Muslims have ever wanted it's like an insult to them the vast

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:30.200
[Guest]: majority of Muslims in this country are working class artisans craftsmen self-made people and

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:35.960
[Guest]: they're from the subaltern caste they're not from the Ashraf Syed caste who've been the leadership

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:42.600
[Guest]: of the opposition parties they have been asking for their share in the economic social cake even

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:48.760
[Guest]: within the community they haven't got it so I think if if political parties started articulating

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:56.120
[Guest]: what India stands for in terms of all of this secularism means this secularism

01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:05.400
[Guest]: equality non-discrimination between various faiths and within communities as well I think

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:10.200
[Guest]: if you have the moral courage to do that and I can't see which leaders are very few there are a

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:18.120
[Guest]: few who do it in their own way I think it's it's possible that your disgruntled

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:24.520
[Guest]: hassle voter who doesn't vote will get inspired to say yes we believe we are like Muslims who

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:29.640
[Guest]: are secular we are Hindus or secular but we don't want this nonsense kind of secularism that you're

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:35.480
[Guest]: electorally peddling out to us which is meaningless we want real secularism and I think the real

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:41.560
[Guest]: secularism exists it's it's morally people are living it all the time Muslims have I mean if you

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:46.120
[Guest]: look at today's Muslim you look at the number of Muslim girls who are kind of educating themselves

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:50.040
[Guest]: they've not done it on a free lunch they've done it out of the battling patriarchy within the

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:55.160
[Guest]: battling patriarchy within the families but they just need articulation why is opposition

01:30:55.160 --> 01:31:01.240
[Guest]: politics not keen on doing that and I think it's possible to do that it needs to and these

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:07.880
[Guest]: things need to be said I mean when someone like Tikayat the farmers leader in Muzaffarnagar

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:15.960
[Guest]: has that slogan Har Har Mahavadev Allahu Akbar it's a transformational moment

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:22.120
[Guest]: because all of us are wondering Rakesh Tikayat used to be a fairly reactionary big big farmer

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:26.760
[Guest]: but even that whole struggle and his interacting with the small farmer the middle farmer the woman

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:32.600
[Guest]: farmer the Dalit farmer and his realization that where is this politics taking us has made him kind

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:37.880
[Guest]: of utter those slogans you know even Mamata Banerjee when she was faced with a couple of

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:42.360
[Guest]: times during the Bengal elections she was trying to articulate Ishwar Allah Tero Nam this is my

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:48.200
[Guest]: secularism don't try and tell me when the I think the congress on the left hand try and put up an

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:53.080
[Guest]: ultra right-wing Muslim against one of her candidates so we've seen glimmerings of that

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:59.720
[Guest]: we've seen glimmerings of that but this needs to be an principled accepted position that we are

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:05.320
[Guest]: going to battle for secularism which is intrinsic to intrinsic to this country staying one and

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:11.720
[Guest]: united and that means no nonsense politics which talks about equality and discrimination so yes

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:16.680
[Guest]: much more imagination is required and moral courage so i used to find it a little bit of

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:22.440
[Amit Varma]: a semantic paradox where a couple of decades ago the BJP would go on and on against the congress's

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:27.960
[Amit Varma]: pseudo secularism while at the same time they had no regard for secularism either so it's like you

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:31.880
[Amit Varma]: know you're you accuse someone of being pseudo secular if you're saying that hey they're

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:35.960
[Amit Varma]: pretending to be secular but then one would imagine you want to be secular but that's not

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:41.080
[Amit Varma]: the case either i want to ask you a question about this then because you know you mentioned a real

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:47.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of secularism where you know you build that equality into society now one of the

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:53.800
[Amit Varma]: complaints lasting complaints of the hindu right has been against the hindu court bill

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:59.480
[Amit Varma]: saying that why are you only reforming our personal laws why not the minorities perfectly

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:04.600
[Amit Varma]: rational complaint to have and that is why also you know the ucc is the uniform civil code is

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:09.640
[Amit Varma]: going to be an issue at some point in time though you know there are other incentives

01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:18.200
[Amit Varma]: obviously driving them towards that so would you say that part of the reason for the vehemence

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:26.360
[Amit Varma]: and the radicalness of hindutva coming up the way it has are also the mistakes that the congress

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:32.680
[Amit Varma]: made in terms of not being truly secular or being pseudo secular you know building that vote bank

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:40.120
[Amit Varma]: pandering to it so on and so forth you know what is what's what's your take on that whole debate

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:43.560
[Guest]: i won't use the word pseudo secular because i think it's a it's a it's an abuse term

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:49.640
[Guest]: but i think it's uh it was a hollowed out secularism that was trying to be uh tom-tom and

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:54.200
[Guest]: it's ironic that the same party that did that because it was a party let's not forget for 45

01:33:54.200 --> 01:34:01.480
[Guest]: years uh also uh you know today even before kj val started playing its own version of soft

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:06.920
[Guest]: hindutva now kj val has taken it to another obnoxious level so i think obviously i think

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:12.600
[Guest]: that a lot of what happened and a lot of the ceding of power to the hindutva right has been

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:17.160
[Guest]: possible because of the mistakes of earlier parties without question but on this point i

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:22.840
[Guest]: really really feel very very strongly that so much ground was lot and it's not as if and you know it

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:27.400
[Guest]: was both things and i want to join that as well because this is something that the hindu uh

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:31.720
[Guest]: privileged castes and classes not all of them who support the hindu right need to understand

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:37.640
[Guest]: and were rightly angry about what the congress did on this score is that they also did not do

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:42.680
[Guest]: enough to protect the life and economic livelihood of minorities when it came to riots and all of

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:47.960
[Guest]: that so both things were happening so you alienate even the minority by not doing enough whether it

01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:54.920
[Guest]: is an 84 with the sikh community or made at malayana nellie nellie was the first post-independence

01:34:54.920 --> 01:35:02.360
[Guest]: massacre of muslims in in bengali speaking muslims in asa so you see you did both things that you

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:06.680
[Guest]: hollowed out the word secularism so much so that you neither like protected the life and livelihood

01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:14.200
[Guest]: of the religious minority as stringently as you should have done and equally well you hollowed

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:18.920
[Guest]: it out by quote unquote these silly pampering acts which were meaningless through which you

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:25.720
[Guest]: kind of created a coterie of this uh of male clergy privileged sections who became the

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:30.440
[Guest]: spokespersons of the community with whereas the community had moved way ahead

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:36.680
[Guest]: disgusted with that same leadership you know so you don't want to navigate or negotiate with

01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:45.160
[Guest]: a modern looking uh you know um you know a man or woman uh from from who may be a

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:49.560
[Guest]: believing muslim maybe an agnostic but who definitely represents his or her community

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:54.040
[Guest]: because he or she is going to question the way you look at her community that don't stereotype me

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:57.800
[Guest]: i have been working i'm working that i'm a busty level worker i'm a self-made person

01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:03.640
[Guest]: uh please don't patronize me it was a relationship of patronage not a relationship of rights and i

01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:07.480
[Guest]: keep saying i used to say this because i have a certain equation with the muslim community because

01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:11.960
[Guest]: my work i used to say this in-house all the time that why do you have this relationship of

01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:17.240
[Guest]: patronage with the opposition party that time it was a ruling party demand it as your right as a

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:21.640
[Guest]: citizen of this country as a citizen of this country you need to be protected you need to

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:27.160
[Guest]: have economic livelihoods you you shouldn't and you should demand that every time wise you're

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:31.960
[Guest]: taking four generations back every time there's a riot so much of your property is destroyed

01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:39.000
[Guest]: and you know this is under which regimes before before before 2002 you know so uh so it was both

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.160
[Guest]: things happening i just wanted to table that equally well come this very good question you

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:48.040
[Guest]: raised minuscule sections of the muslim community were raising this question of codification of the

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:55.400
[Guest]: sharia law from the beginning and uh i don't think the hindu community should feel resentful about it

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:59.160
[Guest]: they should be happy that at least that happened to them but they should certainly ask the question

01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:04.280
[Guest]: like indian all indians should as to why there was not a similar codification of the sharia

01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:09.880
[Guest]: bill i don't think uniform civil code is the way to go but the codification which will then ensure

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:14.680
[Guest]: certain gender just provisions emerging and then if you want a certain gender just code or the

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:20.520
[Guest]: special marriages act to become a more gender just and representative diverse thing certainly do that

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:25.560
[Guest]: i think that's another very valid proposition when you've had voices within the muslim community

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:32.120
[Guest]: raise this question again and again and again that please codify these three practices like

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:37.320
[Guest]: like again i'll repeat polygamy triple talaq halala and others they don't exist in other muslim

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:43.400
[Guest]: countries so why do they exist in india and yet this uh so that's the other thing that happened

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:49.720
[Guest]: with the shah banu thing which is i think important to table here is that the the the creature called

01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:55.000
[Guest]: the muslim person of war that had been dead for about 80 90 years didn't exist in terms of the

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.240
[Guest]: political consciousness of this country or community or the muslim community was resurrected

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:04.840
[Guest]: by none other than rajiv kanthi because of that stupid exercise of getting that special law passed

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:09.400
[Guest]: now never mind the fact that you know that law itself that muslim women divorce protection act

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:14.120
[Guest]: has also been used by muslim women to get their rights because that's what people will do but

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:19.320
[Guest]: but the impulse to pass that law to take out a question section of the community away from the

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:26.200
[Guest]: purview of normal uh criminal law is it was what uh alienated large sections of the majority

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:31.640
[Guest]: population so i think that is something we need to recognize that how do we view different

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:37.400
[Guest]: communities when we govern what do we mean by secularization of society uh you know what do

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:45.880
[Guest]: we mean by secularization of state so congress also precurs the uh majoritarianism in the state

01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:51.080
[Guest]: if you look at 1984 i mean if you look at mrs gandhi's statement that she made from jammu i

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:57.000
[Guest]: remember i think 1980 i was horrified horrified when i read that when she said and that's why

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.960
[Guest]: balasaheb devaraj of the rss had said that she's the tiger and we need to support her is that uh

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:07.320
[Guest]: she was she said i'm faced with khalistan on one side and i'm faced with uh separatism in kashmir

01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:13.240
[Guest]: so i'm appealing to hindu india to vote for me you know so it's not as if the majoritarianism

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:21.480
[Guest]: had not started creeping into the state as well earlier the the state in the latter years of the

01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:26.040
[Guest]: rule of the earlier opposition largely the congress but even even the coalitions did

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:31.160
[Guest]: ignore the whole question of the communalization of the police force which was like a hugely

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:35.800
[Guest]: a problematic issue which had thrown itself up i did a lot of investigative work on this

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:41.400
[Guest]: when i started covering communal violence and found that and so so all of this built up into

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:47.720
[Guest]: what we are seeing today you know so state agencies police governance in governance agencies

01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:55.080
[Guest]: it's one thing to be secular neutral uh you know that you don't really bring a live secularism

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:59.240
[Guest]: but another thing to allow the induction of those kind of people who actually have an ideology which

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:05.080
[Guest]: is hardcore rss and there's a big difference it happened started happening so you know veer

01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:10.760
[Amit Varma]: sanghvi in his recent memoir and in an episode he did with me speaks about exactly what you said how

01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:17.320
[Amit Varma]: the 1984 congress vote was really a expression of the hindu vote and at that point the bjp realizes

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:21.080
[Amit Varma]: that hey we are losing the battle that used to belong to us you know let this you know they

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:24.520
[Amit Varma]: formed the bjp saying we'll do gandhi and socialism but they said forget that you know

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:29.800
[Amit Varma]: let's chase the vote and then you have that sort of that competitive race to the bottom as it were

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:36.440
[Amit Varma]: and this is sort of one trend that is playing itself out that makes it seem inevitable i also

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:43.560
[Amit Varma]: did an episode with vinay sitapati on sort of the history of the bjp before modi and sha and

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:50.680
[Amit Varma]: one of the interesting points he made there was that liberalization in 1991 while it led to all

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:56.760
[Amit Varma]: the prosperity and all the great things that happened one of the sort of side effects was

01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:02.920
[Amit Varma]: that it brought into being a new middle class which just happened to be conservative or bigoted

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:08.200
[Amit Varma]: or whatever term you want to use for it and that played into the political arena and thinking of

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:14.600
[Amit Varma]: it that way it almost seems as if what we have seen in our politics in terms of the general direction

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:21.160
[Amit Varma]: was sort of inevitable events might be circumstantial and uh you know different

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:25.960
[Amit Varma]: things happen at different points like you said the godhra incident was just a pretext for what

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:30.680
[Amit Varma]: was already planned and we'll talk about that in detail as well but the general direction was

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:37.320
[Amit Varma]: always this the general drift was always this is that a take that you'd agree with or do you feel

01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:41.960
[Amit Varma]: that it's too much based on hindsight that there are different directions we could have taken

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:47.960
[Guest]: that it need not have gone this way even that question is would be hindsight you know even

01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:51.560
[Guest]: that answering that question itself would be hindsight so i just want to mention that it's

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:56.520
[Guest]: very easy to uh you know take it either way that it's very easy to adopt this position which you

01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:00.760
[Guest]: already mentioned that it was going to go this way anyway uh then the question i asked myself

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:04.520
[Guest]: that is that a kind of a defeatist position that you're trying to say that because you

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:09.080
[Guest]: maybe we didn't do enough or maybe you didn't anticipate deeply enough and is that why we

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:13.400
[Guest]: are now today coming up with that that that analysis or then i will ask myself this question

01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:17.880
[Guest]: but then if not that then what what could have been done differently would be the next question

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:22.200
[Guest]: and i think one immediate thing which definitely occurs to me is federalism i'm coming back to

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:28.920
[Guest]: something which is i think uh decentralized politics and federalism so federalism is not

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:34.040
[Guest]: just in terms of what how you disempower the states financially and economically and culturally

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:39.000
[Guest]: but i think also how political parties that is a dominant political party again you come back to

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:45.160
[Guest]: congress but i think all of them dealt with regional leaders dealt with diverse diversity

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:52.840
[Guest]: in leadership and all of that and i think that that decentralization uh diversification in politics

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.960
[Guest]: enabling leaderships to come up from subaltern communities and castes

01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:01.800
[Guest]: and federalism i think is something we should have definitely done differently

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:06.520
[Guest]: because i think this as the belief kind of took hold with the same middle class you're talking

01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:12.200
[Guest]: about that you know only a top heavy centralized one man messiah kind of a thing which has never

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:15.560
[Guest]: been the solution anywhere in the world in any case it's just been one of those

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:22.680
[Guest]: things that catch catch people's fancy but just end up in pure disaster so actually the best

01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:29.080
[Guest]: governments have always been coalition and low-key and non-confrontationist but but somehow the

01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:33.480
[Guest]: that's not what the hindi film is about and that's not what the that's not what the narrative is

01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:38.280
[Guest]: about so i think this is definitely one thing we need to be looking at very seriously today

01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:44.200
[Guest]: when we talk about other things we need to be talking about uh you know um the the federal

01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:49.000
[Guest]: aspects of the constitution even if it is not federal enough what changes need to be made and

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:56.440
[Guest]: how india can possibly be governed uh peacefully and successfully or non-confrontationally and

01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:03.080
[Guest]: possible by respecting maximum amount of layered diversity meaning diversity not just at one level

01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:08.920
[Guest]: or whatever but right from the bottom up to the top because i think it is this diversity itself

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:15.160
[Guest]: and only that will eventually be a proper bulwark against this i agree with your solutions about

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:19.240
[Amit Varma]: federalism and decentralization but that also begs the question because if you just go back

01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:23.560
[Amit Varma]: to the circumstances like you mentioned the constitution was framed where when the country

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:29.240
[Amit Varma]: was basically falling apart you know gyan prakash had a book where he sort of made the point that

01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:34.040
[Amit Varma]: the emergency that indira gandhi called in 75 was actually constitutional and the reason it

01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:39.880
[Amit Varma]: was constitutional was that so much power was centralized in the constitution by the framers

01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:43.480
[Amit Varma]: and it was rational for them to do so because they looked around and hey the country is falling

01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:52.120
[Amit Varma]: apart so would federalism even have been uh possible and then if you just look at how power

01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:57.560
[Amit Varma]: uh you know plays in uh to character you know i had an episode with rahul varma and i discussed

01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:02.520
[Amit Varma]: this with others as well where we speak about the decline of the congress party in the real moment

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:08.520
[Amit Varma]: where the decline gathers space is indira gandhi where she starts changing chief ministers at will

01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:12.680
[Amit Varma]: and she's just completely centralizing all power within the congress so it is kind of

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:18.200
[Amit Varma]: run from delhi and that's when the party kind of decays and that's why you see what is happening

01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:25.320
[Amit Varma]: today and you know the roots are back there so in a vacuum yeah sure you know you need more

01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:30.840
[Amit Varma]: federalism need more decentralization and i'm sure we can add things to the list but realistically

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:37.160
[Amit Varma]: you know but i mean i i don't want to seem sort of defeatist and you know it was always

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:42.680
[Amit Varma]: meant to be this way but you know it's hard for me to pick out a point where it could have gone

01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:46.680
[Amit Varma]: in in in a different direction but it's not a question and i'm not even arguing with you i'm

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:51.480
[Guest]: just kind of uh i mean let me just come to the last three years or four years in maharashtra

01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:56.280
[Guest]: okay and we had this experiment it's like a crazy experiment maharashtra vikasagadi

01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:00.120
[Guest]: and i don't think i could have believed anybody could have believed that such an experiment could

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:04.120
[Guest]: have been even possible or whether it would succeed and i think it reasonably succeeded

01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:09.320
[Guest]: and i think the biggest test for it was covid the biggest test for it was a pandemic lockdown

01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:14.680
[Guest]: period if you look at the manner in which the lockdown was handled from delhi and from the

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:20.520
[Guest]: thali punching and the lockdown and then that led to the millions of people i mean after partition

01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:25.560
[Guest]: it was the most miserable migration we saw of our migrant workers on the roads and how many

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:31.640
[Guest]: of them lost their lives and all of that that was central government were inflicted and then we saw

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:35.000
[Guest]: what happened in maharashtra i'm not saying other states didn't do it but i'm saying the manner in

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:41.400
[Guest]: which it was handled in maharashtra far from perfect but far from bad the manner in which

01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:49.240
[Guest]: a man who became chief minister completely untested we know the background we know everything

01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:55.560
[Guest]: but the manner in which he sort of uh commandeered those uh one and a half years i think got respect

01:46:55.560 --> 01:47:01.240
[Guest]: from many of my friends in sitting in delhi uh who were even appalled by the way kaj kejwal handled

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:06.120
[Guest]: the delta the second round where there was death and devastation in delhi and uttar pradesh and

01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:15.480
[Guest]: gujarat and others so my point is uh i think over intellectualizing uh and dismissing issues like

01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:22.520
[Guest]: federalism and diversity like you've done it won't help you'll need to concretize uh what i'm trying

01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:29.480
[Guest]: to say with with moments when this could have happened or can happen in future uh and can it

01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:35.080
[Guest]: happen realistically is the question we need to deal with okay that can this kind of diversification

01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:43.240
[Guest]: and uh decentralization actually happen or is it too far gone a story now and i think that's

01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:47.560
[Guest]: the challenge we will have to face and it's going to happen i believe because of the manner in which

01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:52.520
[Guest]: economics is going the manner in which the workforce pressures are going the manner in

01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:57.480
[Guest]: which agricultural pressures are going and the cultural and religious issues we are facing it

01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:03.320
[Guest]: i think that that is going to be the only solution people will finally find or we'll split up you

01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:08.040
[Guest]: know into god knows how many fragments because this kind of thing is unfeasible not feasible

01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:13.160
[Guest]: to continue for a long time so either you're going to be able to figure out and this is exactly what

01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:18.280
[Guest]: Kamal Nath is talking about every single day which is that we sitting in Bombay and Delhi

01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:21.240
[Guest]: don't read about what's happening in the south because the south has not mattered to our

01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:26.760
[Guest]: consciousness we are so north oriented you know we are so Delhi uh Sarkar oriented i mean this

01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:30.520
[Guest]: is a conversation that is happening every day when they're saying that we'll call you not union

01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:34.680
[Guest]: government with central government it's very very fundamental issues that are being raised

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:39.480
[Guest]: and and those are successful strong governments that have raised them where there's a strong

01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:44.760
[Guest]: social justice component where there's also atrocities on Dalits and all that we know that

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:50.600
[Guest]: so my point is it's happening at a real level also it's Maharashtra was an experiment Tamil

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:55.960
[Guest]: Nadu is something else Kerala is something else so let's just see i mean let's just see i mean

01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:59.880
[Guest]: today what's happening in say Telangana and what TRS is trying to do what just came out in the

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:05.560
[Guest]: papers this morning in terms of how it's i mean we know that they're trying to buy off these MLAs

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:10.920
[Guest]: and MPs all the time how far is that buying out going to go because the politics that we are

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:17.800
[Guest]: seeing which this regime has perpetrated Modi and Shah as you put it is not a genuine centralization

01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:23.800
[Guest]: of politics it is also huge amount of money throwing around after demonetization we everybody

01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:27.800
[Guest]: knows how this money got into their hands yet there's no institution that is prepared to

01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:34.280
[Guest]: question it yet so all of this is up in the air and out in the open it's known and yet it's unknown

01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:39.160
[Guest]: it's known and yet it's untackled you know so i think it's therefore not a fair level level playing

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:44.440
[Guest]: field at all by any means whether it's the election commission you're talking about the courts that

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:48.920
[Guest]: are willing to question etc so my point is we have to see how all this plays out is it going to be

01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:53.960
[Guest]: getting much much worse before it never gets better or is it going to get slightly better

01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:58.120
[Guest]: so there's going to be spaces created where there'll be more resistance that is the question

01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:04.680
[Amit Varma]: no i take back my words you're right these are signs of hope especially you know udav thackeray's

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:10.120
[Amit Varma]: leadership and i'll have a question about that which just kind of struck me and as much as that

01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:14.520
[Amit Varma]: is a sign of hope you know earlier we were talking about our oppositional politics is letting us down

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:20.600
[Amit Varma]: but i think if there's one thing that gave me joy and hope about this country it was the mass

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:26.040
[Guest]: protests at the time of ca no and also when bilkis's remission happened yeah i was in jail

01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:30.600
[Guest]: but i was unbelievable that i saw the level of protests that happened and the kind of people

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:35.960
[Guest]: were horrified at the act brazen act of not just the gujarat government but also now we know the

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:42.040
[Guest]: center yeah despite the fact that the presiding judge mr salvi and the cbi also opposed the

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:48.040
[Guest]: remission i think both things you know sorry to interrupt the ca and this for me was a sign of

01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:54.840
[Guest]: hope that and even a man like udav thackeray mentions the bilkis banu remission you know

01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:59.880
[Guest]: i mean and uh one particular example i would like to give about udav ji because i think it's very

01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:05.880
[Guest]: important an interesting experiment happened the first round in 2020 i'm talking about when the

01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:10.840
[Guest]: lockdown was declared and all that there's a large education campus in punah happened to be owned by

01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:15.400
[Guest]: a muslim i won't get into names and all there's a mosque there the person who was this thing he

01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:21.400
[Guest]: offered it to the local administration for quarantine and he that became was like a spiral

01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:26.680
[Guest]: effect a lot of mosques in western maharashtra and maharashtra gave up because large areas they said

01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:33.560
[Guest]: we can allow the mosque to be used for quarantine spaces for covid udav ji actually did a video or

01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:38.440
[Guest]: this thing somewhere thanking the muslim community saying that this is very valuable space because

01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:42.680
[Guest]: they were running out of space they were appealing for schools and colleges now you know these are

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:50.440
[Guest]: very small things but in a very battered hateful public atmosphere it's just a recognition of

01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:54.360
[Guest]: different people's contribution and different communities contributions and it means a lot

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.440
[Guest]: and i don't think it means that you're compromising on your being a believing

01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:04.200
[Guest]: hindu or whatever it is it is genuine indian lived secularism that's what he did so there

01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:08.120
[Guest]: are examples like that you are going to come up with which which are happening around us

01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:13.720
[Guest]: few and far between maybe not enough but i think if those kind of things can be strengthened because

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:19.080
[Guest]: and that they can be strengthened only by a kind of self-confident politician who believes that

01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:24.520
[Guest]: his or her supporter is not going to go away because he or she says that small things can be

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:29.560
[Amit Varma]: big things and this reminds me of an incident i'll share with you for those of my listeners

01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:33.560
[Amit Varma]: also who haven't heard my episode with mukulika banerjee but i was very moved by this story

01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:38.520
[Amit Varma]: mukulika has written this great book on the khudai khidmatgar called the pathan unarmed

01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:43.320
[Amit Varma]: and to do research for the book she spent she took 10 years to write it but she spent a few

01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:47.640
[Amit Varma]: months in the northwest frontier province in pakistan going from village to village looking

01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:52.280
[Amit Varma]: for for past members of the khudai khidmatgar who would all be in their 70s 80s or whatever

01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:58.520
[Amit Varma]: and she noticed that actually as she goes through these villages you know in those areas beef is

01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:04.520
[Amit Varma]: very cheap and chicken is expensive so every house keeps just one chicken in case a special guest

01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:10.520
[Amit Varma]: comes and wherever she was going she was being given that one chicken which is so expensive for

01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:15.720
[Amit Varma]: them and she felt so bad that she started eating beef and then she came back to india and she told

01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:20.920
[Amit Varma]: her mother who was a devout hindu about what she'd done and her mother thought for some time

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:29.400
[Guest]: and that's such a beautiful story which speaks to exactly you will find most people most indians

01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:34.680
[Guest]: even today under modisha's india reacting like that they're horrified by the lynchings they

01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:39.160
[Guest]: horrified by the thing i don't believe our people are i mean it's a wretched country to be in just

01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:45.080
[Guest]: now because of what the silence i see around that there's not enough protest but then i tell myself

01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:48.840
[Guest]: there are reasons for it and the people are not willing to take risks etc but i think ordinary

01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:53.160
[Guest]: people do react to these things but the fact that the media doesn't let those stories come through

01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:57.560
[Guest]: the fact that and therefore i feel the hugest and biggest abdication is by the media today and

01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:02.920
[Guest]: they're they're going to be historically culpable for the personal human cost that is being paid by

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:08.280
[Guest]: young lives who are incarcerated by this regime and and the lives have been brutally taken away

01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:13.320
[Guest]: by this regime it's the media house responsible collectively because if they let the stories of

01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:19.320
[Guest]: hope and the stories of struggle get across like they used to at one stage then i think others get

01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:24.920
[Guest]: emboldened no you come out of your kind of isolated cocoon you feel like this is happening

01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:29.400
[Guest]: people are fighting something is happening so we can also do something small

01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:34.280
[Amit Varma]: you don't need to necessarily do big things it plays to what the sociologist timur quran calls

01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:39.640
[Amit Varma]: preference falsification one way in which i kind of explain what has happened over the last few

01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:45.080
[Amit Varma]: years is that there were so many closeted bigots among us who kept their bigotry to themselves but

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:49.640
[Amit Varma]: social media emboldened them to speak out because they saw so many others like them

01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:54.760
[Amit Varma]: and you had what quran would call a preference cascade and the modi wave and so on but what you

01:54:54.760 --> 01:55:00.440
[Amit Varma]: are saying is that it can also go the other way that a lot of us in these heated environments

01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:05.720
[Amit Varma]: are sort of not speaking against it but you know if enough people start doing it and just when

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:09.960
[Amit Varma]: covid struck it seemed as if people were doing that young people were out on the streets waving

01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:14.920
[Guest]: the preamble and it seemed like 300 or 400 meetings i attended on cnrc because of assam

01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:19.720
[Guest]: experience across india i was just doing trainings because people knew we were working in assam so

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:23.640
[Guest]: they kept calling us how do we cope tomorrow if it comes and it's going to come i'm telling your

01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:28.520
[Guest]: viewers now it'll come next year they'll bring in npr nrc because they have nothing else they have

01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:33.640
[Guest]: nothing else but negativity and confusion to offer our people they want to put they want us to trace

01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:38.680
[Guest]: our documents around so that we are not in a position to struggle and challenge them so i

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:43.320
[Guest]: think we need to prepare ourselves for this kind of vicious onslaught because one of the other

01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:48.440
[Guest]: things i said and this is i was privileged enough to deliver the kanabiran memorial lecture for pocl

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:53.480
[Guest]: within a year of this regime coming in and that was 2016-17 and things are so much worse now

01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:57.160
[Guest]: when i said they've opened up so many fronts

01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:01.800
[Guest]: why this government or regime is worse than any other is because they've opened up multiple fronts

01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:08.840
[Guest]: economic, adivasi, dalit, minority, human rights, unemployment i mean on every and they've opened

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:13.960
[Guest]: up so many front and if i sit and calculate there may be 20-25 000 of us all over the country

01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:19.800
[Guest]: who are fighting this it's not enough they have to be many many more but there are those doing

01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:24.680
[Guest]: fantastic things but you need to somehow create an atmosphere with which this will spiral

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:35.320
[Guest]: and that fear of reprisal will go because that is what is making people quiet

01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:41.640
[Amit Varma]: so before we go in for a break one sort of final question sparked by what you said about uddhav

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:45.320
[Amit Varma]: and this is just me thinking aloud in my grand tradition of randomly thinking aloud

01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:51.560
[Amit Varma]: which is one thing that i really loved about uddhav was his style of speaking to the people

01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:56.520
[Amit Varma]: where it's like he's speaking to a friend that you know angela merkel has the same thing for example

01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:02.680
[Amit Varma]: where you're not declaiming in front of an audience grandly but it's it's personal it's intimate it's

01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:06.760
[Amit Varma]: almost like a friend is speaking to you or you know your elder brother is speaking to you it's

01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:13.400
[Amit Varma]: it's that kind of a connection and that leads me to thinking about a you mentioned earlier that

01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:17.480
[Amit Varma]: across the world people seem to like strongman leaders so every once in a while that's the

01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:23.640
[Amit Varma]: narrative that's a narrative no there's actually an evolutionary explanation for it that all our

01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:29.880
[Amit Varma]: instincts evolved in prehistoric times we lived in small tribes uh you know it's a dog eat dog

01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:35.080
[Amit Varma]: world you want the leader of your tribe to be the strongest bigger biggest mofo there is so it's

01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:40.040
[Amit Varma]: perhaps you're instinctively drawn to leaders who appear to be strong yes but i don't think that's

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:46.680
[Amit Varma]: yeah but and i'll now come to what appears to be a completely unrelated subject that one movement

01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:52.920
[Amit Varma]: i've seen in the creator economy is that whereas the superstars of yesterday and perhaps all the

01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:58.280
[Amit Varma]: way till recently were people who were larger than life right so you have your amitabh bachchan and

01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:03.560
[Amit Varma]: you have your uh shahrukh khan even and you build temples to them and they're just larger than life

01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:08.600
[Amit Varma]: and today in the creator economy the people who do really well are people who are authentic to

01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:13.800
[Amit Varma]: themselves who build an intimate connection you feel like they are your friend and i wonder if a

01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:20.680
[Amit Varma]: similar sort of connect can be made in politics as well where it's not just the larger than life

01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:28.680
[Amit Varma]: you know modiji declaiming in you know his shudh hindi or whatever but just someone like udhav

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:34.680
[Amit Varma]: sitting talking one-on-one almost as if he's a guest on a podcast kind of uh chatting with you

01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:41.000
[Amit Varma]: and i wonder if a leader like that can also then get a mass following and and kind of get through

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:46.200
[Amit Varma]: i mean what what do you think because you've uh you've written a lot about the shiv sena in your

01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:53.960
[Amit Varma]: book as well neither of us is too fond of udhav's dad for example and i'd done an episode on

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:58.200
[Amit Varma]: maharashtra politics with sujata anandan where she did kind of see it coming she saw udhav as

01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:05.480
[Amit Varma]: someone who is you know not cut in the same mold what is your sense that is this that when we talk

01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:12.440
[Amit Varma]: about a new politics do we need to look at a new politics not just in terms of issues but also in

01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:17.880
[Amit Varma]: terms of manner of communicating and reaching out because as an activist you are communicating and

01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:23.480
[Amit Varma]: reaching out all the time what do the people want what do you know see we need to understand that

01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:27.960
[Guest]: this narrative that we are constantly being fed and i'm sure some of it is true because it's like

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:34.200
[Guest]: the eternal stereotype a stereotype is powerful because at least 15 of it is true otherwise it

01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:39.080
[Guest]: can't work okay therefore this narrative of you know the messiah or the big man or the big woman

01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:46.360
[Guest]: or the strong strong is good for you is the a narrative but i would put it just as a narrative

01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:49.800
[Guest]: i'd say it's a descriptive narrative not a normative that's what i'm trying to say and i was

01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:54.200
[Guest]: just going to the next point i want to make is just six yesterday i read somewhere i pinned it

01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:58.680
[Guest]: i've not yet read the whole thing that 66 percent of people indians don't know i have not heard of

01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:04.280
[Guest]: monkey bar i mean just i've flipped flitted through that i've not read the study yet now if this is

02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:09.560
[Guest]: even a good sample and a study it tells you it's an answer to your question that if 66 percent of

02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:14.600
[Guest]: indian don't know what a megalomaniac is saying and for which he thinks it's you know it's the

02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:19.640
[Guest]: biggest and the most important moment of his prime ministerial life every month then it tells you

02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:25.960
[Guest]: something okay now coming back to udhav udhav ji you know very interesting thing is if you look a

02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:31.000
[Guest]: little history and trajectory like you're interested in doing go to his grandfather

02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:44.120
[Guest]: a social reform interrogating caste took the rss head on you know and in fact i think recently the

02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:48.680
[Guest]: republication of his collected works has happened in marathi at least i'm hoping they'll come in

02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:53.800
[Guest]: english sometime so i think you know there is there's a multifaceted tradition behind

02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:57.880
[Amit Varma]: behind what we are talking about families containment yeah and what i think was the

02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:04.440
[Guest]: strength of udhav was what you're saying that not just as a friend he was calm in in in today

02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:12.440
[Guest]: i think people would like to listen to words of calm wisdom rather than shrill uh shaking which

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:18.680
[Guest]: see i remember once being on a show by somebody like even rajdeep has become like that now barka

02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:25.800
[Guest]: because towards the 2000 towards 2014 as the as the trajectory of modi build up even the anchor

02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:30.600
[Guest]: sort of fell in line you know and everyone was shrieking on television i realized i could see

02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.320
[Guest]: i remember when one what was that thing she used to do that one of the talk shows she used to do

02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:41.000
[Guest]: we the people we the people it was chandranitra and other and one day i told her i said barka

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.720
[Guest]: asked me the same question on a lower tone and i whispered she said what do you mean i said the

02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:50.840
[Guest]: moment you start i'll also shout louder that's what you want because see that's the idea that

02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:55.080
[Guest]: if i suppose we were not having this conversation at this and suppose you were kind of very

02:01:55.080 --> 02:02:02.760
[Guest]: excitably saying something my instinct would be to also respond with the same hyperbole okay whereas

02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:09.720
[Guest]: in a nice calm conversation it's possible to talk laugh in a very low tone and and say the

02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:16.680
[Guest]: same things and better things maybe you know so i think this is what udav has that has that ability

02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:21.480
[Guest]: stalin has that also in tamilnadu they're not shrieking and shouting they're making

02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:28.520
[Guest]: solid points i mean stalin may be more political or whatever but and during covid what was very

02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:32.920
[Guest]: interesting about udavji was that he was constantly consultative and i think that

02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:40.040
[Guest]: consultative thing appeals to maharashtrians because it's a rational streak we were faced

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:45.480
[Guest]: with a beast an unknown beast this virus it was freaking us all out we didn't know what to do

02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:50.520
[Guest]: with it was scary it was worrying all over so he was saying okay i'm talking to doctors i'm talking

02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:56.360
[Guest]: to my bureaucrats i'm talking to my team we are trying our best and i think that is the best thing

02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:00.920
[Guest]: you should be able to do in a crisis this is what the prime minister should have been doing talking

02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:07.000
[Guest]: to various chief ministers and their bureaucracy rather than trying to be play god you know because

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.920
[Guest]: even god did not know what covid was you know so i think this is the difference and yes i really

02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:19.560
[Guest]: believe that the way forward for india and the world is going to be collective leadership

02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:27.720
[Guest]: collective solutions collective faces yes attractive young diverse gender diverse ethnic

02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:34.440
[Guest]: diverse all all those boxes have to be ticked but you don't need to have that one strong his him or

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:40.680
[Guest]: her it can be a collective voice and it can be collective solutions also because i think the

02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:45.000
[Guest]: kind of problems you're facing i mean we're not even looking at climate change but when i just

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:51.320
[Guest]: think about the kind of what children will have to face in 2050 which is a hot world which is like

02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:55.880
[Guest]: an oven i mean we are not even looking at all of that because we are so caught up in today's

02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:00.600
[Guest]: we're not looking at the fact that we might have water wars tomorrow in bombay because we just won't

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:05.720
[Guest]: have enough water so you know what are the things we are going to be thinking of short term middle

02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:11.880
[Guest]: term and long term what are the issues we need to focus so we preserve ourselves in some dignity as

02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:16.520
[Guest]: a human race and not completely exterminate exterminate ourselves with the way we are going

02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:23.160
[Amit Varma]: at the moment yeah i mean your thought of modiji is not god is interesting because if he was god

02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:28.360
[Amit Varma]: he wouldn't exist because god doesn't exist but i i you you've made it that's a really profound

02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:34.040
[Amit Varma]: point and how a leader can set the tone the same way a television anchor camera podcast i've

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:39.160
[Guest]: experienced it because i used to be called for tv all the time fortunately now i'm ostracized so i'm

02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:44.440
[Guest]: very lucky because now after 2014 they don't want to call me which is just as well but i realized

02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:48.680
[Guest]: that it was very possible for me to remain calm when they shriek i would just tell them please

02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:53.400
[Guest]: lower your tone i'll answer the question and that would actually unsettle them a little bit

02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:58.840
[Guest]: i said because you know you're doing it so that you want me to scream and this is not a cup panchayat

02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:04.600
[Guest]: it is a television debate or discussion their views need to be exchanged so we don't have to

02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:09.880
[Amit Varma]: be shouting at each other on this note i will gently suggest without shouting or shrieking

02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:13.000
[Amit Varma]: let's take a quick commercial break and we'll continue this on the other side

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:18.760
[Amit Varma]: long before i was a podcaster i was a writer in fact chances are that many of you first heard of

02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:25.080
[Amit Varma]: me because of my blog india uncut which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular

02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:30.920
[Amit Varma]: at the time i loved the freedom the form gave me and i feel i was shaped by it in many ways

02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:35.720
[Amit Varma]: i exercised my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things

02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:40.200
[Amit Varma]: because i wrote about many different things well that phase in my life ended for good

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:45.560
[Amit Varma]: different things well that phase in my life ended for various reasons and now it is time to revive

02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:51.320
[Amit Varma]: it only now i'm doing it through a newsletter i have started the india uncut newsletter at

02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:27.800
[Amit Varma]: welcome back to the scene in the unseen i'm chatting with ishtar setalwad and you know we

02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:32.440
[Amit Varma]: spoke for two hours and we didn't really even get much into your life or your childhood or whatever

02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:40.120
[Amit Varma]: so i want to kind of get into the chronology of that a little bit and i'm fascinated and very

02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:45.080
[Amit Varma]: jealous that you've kind of lived in the same house more or less all your life yeah so lucky

02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:49.640
[Guest]: except for maybe four years when javed and i moved out and started living together in government

02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:56.600
[Guest]: quarters in antofill you were finishing your question or no no yeah i mean uh tell me a little

02:06:56.600 --> 02:07:02.200
[Amit Varma]: bit about that because uh you know i've had guests on the show and sometimes we will discuss what is

02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:09.400
[Amit Varma]: our sense of home and how rooted are we and various of my guests like me will sometimes lament that

02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:14.280
[Amit Varma]: that sense of home is not really so strong one of my guests max rodenbeck spoke about he grew up in

02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:20.040
[Amit Varma]: cairo and he spoke about how to him home means cairo but it is not the cairo of today that no

02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:26.520
[Amit Varma]: longer exists you know it's it's it's it's a cairo of memory and it strikes me that even though you've

02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:31.320
[Amit Varma]: kind of lived in the same place all your life it's not been the same place all your life you know it

02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:37.240
[Amit Varma]: just kept changing and since you know you live in juhu i live in andheri uh you know buildings like

02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:43.560
[Amit Varma]: the one i'm in must seem like monstrosities and unimaginable so tell me a little bit about how

02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:51.800
[Amit Varma]: growing up was like in the 60s and uh you know what was life like actually it was just it was

02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:56.920
[Guest]: just so much fun because it was like a it was like a different bombay different mumbai different

02:07:56.920 --> 02:08:02.360
[Guest]: bombay uh i i mean i've always loved bombay and i think i continue to love it though it has changed

02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:08.440
[Guest]: so much and so and and it has always been juhu as home for me except except four years like i said

02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:13.000
[Guest]: when java then i moved out and started living together much the chagrin of my parents but

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:20.280
[Guest]: anyway so that place where we live now is is off the beach on the beach and very lucky place to be

02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:24.840
[Guest]: because particularly now with all the like you said buildings coming up i won't call it a

02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:29.880
[Guest]: monstrosity but you know large buildings everywhere construction everywhere actually more than the

02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:35.400
[Guest]: buildings i feel the fact that they don't they don't allow trees around them as is mandatory

02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:42.200
[Guest]: required you know you're 14 inch spaces you should have trees that's another story but growing up was

02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:48.520
[Guest]: like uh so next to the bungalow where we live in now which was built in 1964 there's an older

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:54.360
[Guest]: structure which is next door which is an old old bungalow and that is where my grandfather motilal

02:08:54.360 --> 02:09:00.840
[Guest]: moved in 1933 when he broke away from the family home at napiency road which is off settlevard lane

02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:07.720
[Guest]: over there it was named after jim and lal and he was a great man for the outdoors he liked he liked

02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:14.920
[Guest]: open spaces green spaces and all of that so he moved out with his two children atul usha was my

02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:22.280
[Guest]: aunt and atul and his wife and i remember that uh we growing up with these stories of his moving out

02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:27.160
[Guest]: and the older house and the new house as all families have and we still have a lovely black

02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:32.040
[Guest]: and white photograph of the napiency road home which is known as jim and lal's residence

02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:40.200
[Guest]: and when he moved here and my mother had this i saw it after my father passed the old

02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:45.960
[Guest]: land agreement on where my grandfather bought this property there's his signature and there's

02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:52.360
[Guest]: grd tatas so that was all tata land you know so and he didn't buy just this plot where we built

02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:58.360
[Guest]: the home in 64 the old bungalow he bought right he bought about like 20 bungalows worth of the

02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:05.080
[Guest]: whole stretch right from that where naval vakil's bungalow now is where now jai roo auntie lives

02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:09.560
[Guest]: right up to asha parikh's bungalow because his vision was that you know i'll move there and then

02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:15.640
[Guest]: i'll we'll sub sell these plots to friends and family and this this be one large community of

02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:21.080
[Guest]: all of us living together and it worked like that for about 25 30 years for him because i mean 40

02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:27.480
[Guest]: years 50 years for him because 1933 we are talking about so for instance um my father and i were born

02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:34.200
[Guest]: in that 1933 that older bungalow and then this this place was vacant land and then there was my

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:41.160
[Guest]: there was my one aunt another aunt then there was india bombay's very famous dentist bg bg kher's

02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:47.960
[Guest]: brother he had one bungalow then there was gajjar dr gajjar who was bombay's primer pathologist who

02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:54.360
[Guest]: was a friend of my grandfather so it was like that was that sort of a world where my grandfather did

02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:58.600
[Guest]: all that and then of course things started changing in the 70s when people sold off and

02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:03.560
[Guest]: buildings started coming up and everything but what i remembered is that there never was a there

02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:10.520
[Guest]: was never a compound wall so it was like a huge stretch of bungalows bungalows bungalow and gorgeous

02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:15.560
[Guest]: gardens and we used to just run through all of them as kids because it was like no question of

02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:22.600
[Guest]: security no question of uh walls or you know traversing gates or whatever so it was a very

02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:28.680
[Guest]: very lucky existence and the beach i mean for me the sea and the beach was everything and i remember

02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:36.120
[Guest]: right up to when i was 22 23 swimming off juhu beach and swimming at midnight by moonlight as

02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:41.000
[Guest]: well which much to the horror of my sister she'd be really worried because my parents wouldn't know

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:47.720
[Guest]: i had sneaker so it was a safe beach it was a safe place it was a clean beach so it was quite quite

02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:52.440
[Guest]: quite nice and the sound of the sea has always meant huge amounts to me the sound of water in

02:11:52.440 --> 02:12:00.120
[Guest]: the sea but the sea and i think waves sort of always the gentle or the more ferocious waves

02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:06.680
[Guest]: always sort of reflected the mood i was in whether it was upset angry or very calm and i don't know

02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:13.960
[Guest]: why that has always always been a huge thing for me and my mother was a very avid gardener

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.840
[Guest]: and painted planted huge number of trees and she was into you know biodiversity and

02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:25.560
[Guest]: indigenous trees and all of that and she was quite a bird watcher as well so a lot of that

02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:31.960
[Guest]: sort of came through i never had enough time for this till now now last 10 12 years with all my

02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:40.040
[Guest]: hectic stuff i love to cram in four five hours a week in the garden doing planting ensuring that i

02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:46.680
[Guest]: pot report do nursery stuff give plants to a lot of friends in because i think the more

02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:53.080
[Guest]: greenery you can spread the better so there was all of that books were a big thing i mean my

02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:57.240
[Guest]: father my father actually my grandfather had a library not so my grandfather my father was a

02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:02.360
[Guest]: crazy reader i mean he was one of the fastest readers i know i think my son after that and i

02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:07.320
[Guest]: am also quite a fast reader but my son reads very well so he would just devour and a lot of it was

02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:13.160
[Guest]: non-fiction so he had a fun he has a fantastic library so we had a benefit of that and also

02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:18.680
[Guest]: benefit of a father and mother who said that don't bother about your textbooks this is what you need

02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:26.120
[Guest]: to know you need to get into books marks are not important but the book knowledge from books is so

02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:31.800
[Guest]: i think that is also so precious and so important it was also lucky because one didn't have to get

02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:39.160
[Guest]: into the rat race of high marks and jobs but so it was obviously privilege but i think privilege

02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:45.720
[Guest]: used nicely you know rather than in a money also i remember something very intrinsic past of me is

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:51.720
[Guest]: being very very my mother teaching us to be very frugal i mean she used to be very strict about

02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:58.920
[Guest]: money very strict so we never had pocket money in school ever everything you needed you asked for

02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:04.280
[Guest]: and then it was within limits you got it but only after 11 11th and 12th standard college we started

02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:09.560
[Guest]: getting pocket money and always public transport function within your even your films and your

02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:16.120
[Guest]: books have to be savings from your pocket money so i think these things are very important markers

02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:21.960
[Guest]: about what you become how you live how you relate to people i mean yeah money was there is there but

02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:28.360
[Guest]: it's also somebody something you respect you don't you're not crass about it you don't there's a

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:34.680
[Guest]: humility that come i have this story which i always tell people and sometimes javed throws it

02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:40.120
[Guest]: back at me when i'm careless dada used to come we used to he used to be in delhi most of the time

02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:45.880
[Guest]: so the months he spent in juhu or the months we he had another lovely home in uti uttakamal the

02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:52.120
[Guest]: months we'd spend with him there in in whether it's here or we went to delhi to one of the lovely

02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:57.560
[Guest]: government bungalows or into saint patrick's in uti uh you know he'd take these morning and evening

02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:04.840
[Guest]: walks so i'd feel very important walking next to him so as a toddler i'd be walking aping him

02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:09.240
[Guest]: putting my hand at the back and walking and stuff and on the in the juhu bungalow it would be in the

02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:13.880
[Guest]: front lawn he'd go walking up and down so i remember once i think maybe i was in standard

02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:20.760
[Guest]: four or something and it was a sunset time walk and at moment i saw him go out from his bedroom

02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:27.000
[Guest]: i charged from mine to join him and he of course smiled and i started walking together and then i

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:31.560
[Guest]: suddenly saw him turn back towards the house and go into my bedroom because i left the light on

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.160
[Guest]: and he didn't yell he didn't shout but he just went and put off the light and came out

02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:41.400
[Guest]: and he said you know that so that that's those are kind of lessons you

02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:47.000
[Guest]: that stay with you that no wastage of electricity no wasted of money no wasted of resources

02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:52.520
[Guest]: you know you you you live you you have money you live in a fancy place but you

02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:57.480
[Guest]: you must remain grounded and respectful of people and what they are and

02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:04.200
[Guest]: and domestic help was always family their families were family i think all these things really are

02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:09.960
[Guest]: very very crucial to you and for me they were very precious so there was that and of course

02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:20.440
[Guest]: there was a constant engagement with current affairs news law politics a constant so newspapers

02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:24.440
[Guest]: reading the newspapers listening to like you were saying you know earlier that we were so starved of

02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:28.360
[Guest]: entertainment so listening to all india radio listening to whatever forms of news you go at

02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:35.160
[Guest]: was extremely important and then discussing that with my father at the dining and for me that that

02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:44.840
[Guest]: dining table for was an arena for discussion debate and argument and i think that it's it was

02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:51.480
[Guest]: it's it was such a precious site because my father would encourage both our sisters to argue

02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:59.640
[Guest]: and to contest what he said and i think that was the biggest lesson i learned in terms of parenting

02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:05.880
[Guest]: or in terms of teaching even which i started doing later is that you are not threatened by discussion

02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:11.080
[Guest]: or debate or argument that you need to encourage it at every step because that shows growth that

02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:17.480
[Guest]: shows evolution and and regardless of where that argument took us even if it was most bizarre

02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:22.440
[Guest]: things we said but he would encourage us to argue so the days when they would go out for dinner with

02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:27.400
[Guest]: friends or whatever it is i remember listening to the news bbc all india radio writing down all the

02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:30.600
[Guest]: important news points that i had to discuss with him the next day and i would leave the note for

02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:35.240
[Guest]: him i said this is what needs to be discussed tomorrow so i think that sort of discursive

02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:41.160
[Guest]: upbringing you know which is very adult even though you are growing minds you're treated as an adult

02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:46.360
[Guest]: you're given that respect your mind is given i think is is so important and then there are so

02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:51.800
[Guest]: many things you remember because the asian games took place when i was in college elphinstone

02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:56.040
[Guest]: college and that was a big thing because it was the first time india was hosting something

02:17:56.040 --> 02:18:00.840
[Guest]: internationally like that and very exciting for young people so we booked our tickets to delhi

02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:05.880
[Guest]: we said we'll go to the stadiums and watch and everything and all of that and we were there for

02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:11.880
[Guest]: a good week or 10 days watching all of this and then one weekend we took off that's a good friend

02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:17.000
[Guest]: of mine my sister and i we took off to jaipur just touristy kind of a thing to go and see the pink

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:23.880
[Guest]: city when we were coming back and this was the early 80s 81 i think coming back to delhi and

02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:30.360
[Guest]: and we went by st bars the bus was stopped and

02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:41.400
[Guest]: all the sardar boys were asked to get off and they were frisked and i remember getting so agitated

02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:47.960
[Guest]: and upset by it so upset by it and i used to have this habit of constantly discussing everything

02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:54.840
[Guest]: with my father everything including things that really angered me upset me and that time there

02:18:54.840 --> 02:19:00.680
[Guest]: was only std phones not easy to call but i remember making sure that day i went to an std booth and

02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:06.200
[Guest]: taking extra coins and i said what are they doing okay we might be faced with this problem of

02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:12.040
[Guest]: khalistan or whatever but is this the way a state should deal with it if they want if there was a

02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:18.120
[Guest]: fear for a stadium in delhi or some terror attack they should have searched all of us why are you

02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:23.800
[Guest]: singling out one community the moment you do that you're going to alienate and anger that community

02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:31.000
[Guest]: you know and i experienced the same thing in 1995 in charar sharif when charar shir was burned in 95

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:38.840
[Guest]: when i was going from uh shinagar to yusmark so this attitude of the state of you know singling

02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:45.800
[Guest]: out had begun and i think this is what we were not able to see how to handle it and i was remember

02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:50.280
[Guest]: remember feeling very disturbed by it anyway so these are things you think back on you know that

02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:55.640
[Guest]: when you realize that an understanding was growing about some of these issues which you then engaged

02:19:55.640 --> 02:20:02.520
[Guest]: in later family was very important to my father and mother both so family holidays were like a

02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:09.000
[Guest]: huge thing he never ever did not take family holidays so a lot of it was with my grandfather

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:14.600
[Guest]: in delhi either as attorney general or then a member of parliament law commission and all but

02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:21.160
[Guest]: also ooty so and in between we would go other places like we go to himachal or we go to kashmir

02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:27.000
[Guest]: was very very important to us because my uh there's a family connection actually because

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:33.800
[Guest]: sheikh abdullah and my motilal were very close friends because my uh he was my grandfather had

02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:38.840
[Guest]: was the indian council and representative of the united nations for the indian position on kashmir

02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:43.400
[Guest]: and the fact that the sheikh had wanted to stay with india was a huge thing so they were very

02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:52.280
[Guest]: good personal friends so i remember when we went to kashmir one of the one of our family holidays

02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:58.680
[Guest]: uh he hosted us and it was such an awe-inspiring occasion that my father mother and the two of us

02:20:58.680 --> 02:21:04.040
[Guest]: they hosted us for tea and there was a keva and there was a macaroons from kashmir that we ate

02:21:04.680 --> 02:21:11.480
[Guest]: then the other time when we went to dalhousie and the dalai lama hosted us in a similar way because

02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:16.200
[Guest]: just these were like private meetings but i mean they meant so much because you realize these were

02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:22.040
[Guest]: really incredible people that you had a chance to meet simply because uh you had a chance to

02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:28.120
[Guest]: you happen to belong to this family or whatever it is so these were some of the things that stayed

02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:35.960
[Guest]: and there was one one little ditty that my sister and i would keep singing to ourselves which we

02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:41.800
[Guest]: were taught i think by somebody in the family which is that atul motilal chimanlal harilal

02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:46.280
[Guest]: brijrai harrai setelwal which would take all the of course it was very patriarchal because the

02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:52.280
[Guest]: women were not counted but it just showed the long lineage of lawyers in the family so there

02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:57.960
[Guest]: was all of that there was all of that and there was also the fact that my grandparents both sides

02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:07.720
[Guest]: vegetarian uh gujaratis but my father beef eating alcohol consuming atheist a sense of rationality

02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:12.200
[Guest]: that you make your choice so i used to ask him that how did you begin so it was because he went

02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:17.240
[Guest]: for his llm in post-war britain so he stopped drinking stopped drinking sugar in his tea but

02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:22.040
[Guest]: he started consuming beef so there were things like that which were very interesting and my mom

02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:27.080
[Guest]: was never really a committed non-vegetarian but she would indulge my father and she would eat a

02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:33.720
[Guest]: few things here and there she preferred vegetarian she preferred curries rather than meat as such

02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:39.160
[Guest]: but there was all of that there was all of that and we were of course both my sisters are non-vegetarian

02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:43.320
[Guest]: and there was no problem in the family on that my grandparents had no problem

02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:49.960
[Guest]: there was also a huge respect for girls and women's status in the family and education so the

02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:56.200
[Guest]: other thing i remember is my mother very strongly always saying that because she was also part of

02:22:56.200 --> 02:23:02.360
[Guest]: the settlement family from another side so they were second cousins so that dowry is something

02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:07.080
[Guest]: that was frowned upon during marriages so as a principle when there were marriages in the family

02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:11.640
[Guest]: the girls would never be given a dowry and that was one of the thing precursors discussions that

02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:18.120
[Guest]: you know and i think and that on the one hand and education and higher education for girls on the

02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:24.280
[Guest]: other so i think all of these things stay with you and you realize the value of that has come to you

02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:29.560
[Guest]: through a trajectory so there's it's a humbling experience also it's not something that you have

02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:37.240
[Amit Varma]: done but it has been brought to you bunch of questions i want to ask taking off from this and

02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:44.280
[Amit Varma]: i'll quote this para from your from the book about your dad but but first i'll just you know that's

02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:48.760
[Amit Varma]: a lovely anecdote about how you were with your grandfather on the beach and suddenly he turns

02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:55.000
[Amit Varma]: back because he's seen the light on in your room and you know the lesson there is not so much as

02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:00.520
[Amit Varma]: so much as in wasting electricity though that's of course a lesson i think the lesson is to be mindful

02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:06.040
[Amit Varma]: of the things around us and the things that we do with them and there is some of that that also

02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:11.640
[Amit Varma]: comes across when you write about your dad in your book quote atul went to pupil's own a school

02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:16.200
[Amit Varma]: started during the independence movement in a small abode in vilayparle which then moved to khar

02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:21.080
[Amit Varma]: his friends from school included dilip purohit dilip dalal and hameer doshi they made up a jolly

02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:26.120
[Amit Varma]: foursome who stayed close to the end my father had this unique and rare capacity to keep and stay in

02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:30.840
[Amit Varma]: touch with all his friends even if their paths had diverged friday morning before court at the

02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:35.960
[Amit Varma]: new coffee houses where they would often gather stop quote and and i found this worth remarking

02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:41.560
[Amit Varma]: on because one you of course remembered those names and you know an indication of how special

02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:47.160
[Amit Varma]: those people must have been to him and therefore by association to all of you and also just that

02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:53.240
[Amit Varma]: sense of just as you know your grandfather is mindful that the light is on your father is

02:24:53.240 --> 02:24:58.760
[Amit Varma]: mindful that i have to stay in touch with friends and i don't think that that's a quality that we

02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:06.600
[Amit Varma]: can take for granted in modern times because more and more what we see is that we live more and more

02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:11.640
[Amit Varma]: in the abstract worlds inside our smartphones you know you mentioned how in the dining table

02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:15.720
[Amit Varma]: you would be encouraged to discuss stuff you're looking into each other's eyes and you're

02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:21.160
[Amit Varma]: discussing things but the modern dining table is not that the modern dining table is yeah you might

02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:25.400
[Amit Varma]: get four people together but they are looking into their phones or they are lost in their worlds and

02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:33.400
[Amit Varma]: all of that and i mean we are only 12 years apart but i'd say that we are kind of more or less a

02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:39.960
[Amit Varma]: large generation that has seen this transition from having to actually look into people's eyes

02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:43.640
[Amit Varma]: and talk to them and having nothing to do if you're all alone there's no phone to look into

02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:48.520
[Amit Varma]: to this new connected world where you are always engaged and you always you have this

02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:57.000
[Amit Varma]: barrage of sensation and information just kind of coming at you and one thing that i keep reminding

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:02.840
[Amit Varma]: myself to do is to fight this that don't look into your phone when you know when you're with

02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:09.720
[Amit Varma]: someone that make an effort to you know to be with your friends and all of that so do you have

02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:15.800
[Amit Varma]: do you have any observations about this because one of the things that you've done through your

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:24.200
[Amit Varma]: activism is stayed in touch with people actual people you actually meet them actual conversations

02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:29.960
[Amit Varma]: phone calls instead of whatsapp messages you know one very powerful part of your book and we'll come

02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:35.720
[Amit Varma]: to that when we speak about 2002 is when as events unfolded you got call after call after call after

02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:43.160
[Amit Varma]: call after call tell me a little bit about this you know this changing texture of life as it

02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:47.800
[Amit Varma]: as it were and is it something that you've noticed that you feel you need to be on the

02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:52.840
[Amit Varma]: watch out for or that you've seen affecting people around you because i would imagine

02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:58.200
[Amit Varma]: that your kids would have had really different childhoods or growing up years and what someone

02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:04.600
[Guest]: like you would have just in terms of experiences yes and no i think both you're right that you

02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:14.600
[Guest]: know the sheer barrage of electronic information or electronic disinformation that is kind of

02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:19.960
[Guest]: thrown at us is just it's just so it's from all over the place so it's like very difficult to

02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:24.600
[Guest]: escape it but i think and you have to fight it you have to fight it for sure but i think

02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:29.880
[Guest]: some of us our lives inevitably become the fight itself because in for instance

02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:35.800
[Guest]: um there's no way i can do my work without actually engaging with actual people which

02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:41.720
[Guest]: means lots and lots of very very good conversations also means fighting for that time to have those

02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:47.080
[Guest]: conversations because sometimes the other work also takes over which is writing and communicating

02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:53.240
[Guest]: and all of that and everything but i think the sheer activism the sheer expanse of this

02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:56.680
[Guest]: activism means that you have to actually be engaging so you've already said that

02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:01.800
[Guest]: but i think uh uh on a lighter note you know you just have to go to jail to realize

02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:06.840
[Guest]: what happens when your phone is not there or you don't have a device because then the then it's

02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:10.680
[Guest]: it's very and then it's back to your books i mean if you can manage to get the books it's only the

02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:18.360
[Guest]: books and only the books but uh it's uh it's it's one great thing that happened because like you

02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:24.040
[Guest]: yourself mentioned that except for four years i've been here is our kids also grew up here so i was

02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:31.480
[Guest]: very very clear about this that there was no question of unregulated television or computer

02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:37.480
[Guest]: even so they were just on the in the garden and on the beach most of the time so apart from school

02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:44.440
[Guest]: which was bad enough for or good enough or whatever so it it was both being in the modern world and

02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:48.120
[Guest]: yet being quite different because you had the lucky enough to have the outdoors so i think that

02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:54.680
[Guest]: was a good balancing act that happened and then there was very kind of that you choose maybe one

02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:59.800
[Guest]: or two programs for two hours a week and that's it nothing more but that also meant that we did

02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:04.760
[Guest]: not have the television on and that was a very clear choice that we made though we were journalists

02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:09.240
[Guest]: though we were activists stroke news persons we said whatever we do is after they sleep because

02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:13.640
[Guest]: you can't have it running and then make that choice for them it has to be for all of us so

02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:19.880
[Guest]: these are things that you need to be able to be clear clear about you know when you're parenting

02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:25.800
[Guest]: as well but yes it is true that but fortunately i'm i'm quite a crazy i'm crazy person in the

02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:31.080
[Guest]: sense i love cooking i love working with my hands i love craft i love gardening so if i don't do

02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:36.280
[Guest]: that i'll go crazy so because of all of that then that is non-digital work that's non-phone work so

02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:42.760
[Guest]: i can't do without all of that so and i am i've been lucky enough to have really really good

02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:48.760
[Guest]: friends both from childhood and college and even through my activism where new friends have come

02:29:48.760 --> 02:29:53.240
[Guest]: and they're as solid as the old ones and for me the greatest joy when i was in jail was receiving

02:29:53.240 --> 02:29:59.880
[Guest]: 2700 postcards and letters which i was just i mean that just i think if there's one thing that kept

02:29:59.880 --> 02:30:04.760
[Guest]: me going apart from visits from my family it was that and i think it was started as a political

02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:10.280
[Guest]: act by the union the adivasi union i'm working with and the Janwadi Mahila Andolan which is the

02:30:10.280 --> 02:30:15.160
[Guest]: women's wing of the cpim but then it took different form because i got so many personal letters

02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:22.040
[Guest]: childhood friends from california who are now in california or a journalist from indian express

02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:27.320
[Guest]: who wrote to me we worked together in 86 she walks to a card shop in birmingham buys the card

02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:32.440
[Guest]: and posts it to the sabarmati women's jail you know i mean these are i mean i even now it's like

02:30:32.440 --> 02:30:36.920
[Guest]: even now it's like one and a half months down that i'm out but i read and read them all the

02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:41.880
[Guest]: time because i think when and i realize also the importance of the pen and the written word it's

02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:46.920
[Guest]: not simply so i i've told myself that before the year is out i'm going to be replying to each one

02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:51.000
[Guest]: of them so and that that's that's the task i've set myself because i think it's very important

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:56.520
[Guest]: to write letters back and not just email or whatsapp letters back and i think so these i

02:30:56.520 --> 02:31:01.720
[Guest]: think because i think it's the handwriting the pen the paper the postcard the picture postcard

02:31:01.720 --> 02:31:05.800
[Guest]: some of them that they sent and the words that they wrote i mean a close friend of mine jerry

02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:12.040
[Guest]: pinto uh author he wrote one the first postcard which is a picture postcard which has a stamp of

02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:16.200
[Guest]: jay prakash narayan and gandhi where he said they also spent a lot of time in jail and they're

02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:21.960
[Guest]: thinking of you all the time and then there were 16 more which were poems which were unsigned

02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:26.040
[Guest]: and i'm telling myself this is the same person and it was i didn't connect that this is jerry

02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:31.720
[Guest]: he wrote poems from different people from palestinian poets to japanese sports all resistance

02:31:31.720 --> 02:31:37.000
[Guest]: poetry and he wrote poem number one poem number two and poem number 16 and each one was a beautiful

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:41.880
[Guest]: poetry so i mean such lovely stuff people did you know when you were inside and i think these were

02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:47.080
[Amit Varma]: the these were the things that really kept one going yeah i i think the only thing of value we

02:31:47.080 --> 02:31:54.040
[Amit Varma]: collect are people and and this is such a beautiful story in your memoir you also speak about how

02:31:54.040 --> 02:31:57.960
[Amit Varma]: you wrote letters and cards to your grandparents and you were encouraged to do so and you just

02:31:57.960 --> 02:32:04.760
[Amit Varma]: mentioned writing again and something that i often think about is that the experience of writing

02:32:04.760 --> 02:32:09.880
[Amit Varma]: letters and notes and messages has changed completely in the sense that today everything

02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:15.880
[Amit Varma]: is a whatsapp message or a quick email or whatever it's very functional it's very brief

02:32:15.880 --> 02:32:23.160
[Amit Varma]: whereas back in the day if he sat down to write to someone the act of writing itself was one it

02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:27.160
[Amit Varma]: was communicating to the other person that i care about you i'm spending time on this

02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:32.120
[Amit Varma]: and two it was an act of actually sitting down with yourself and examining the contents of your

02:32:32.120 --> 02:32:37.400
[Amit Varma]: own mind it's a it's like a deliberate act of consideration it's not just that you hit compose

02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:43.720
[Amit Varma]: on gmail and you say you know are you free at eight or whatever you know so and and you mentioned

02:32:43.720 --> 02:32:48.600
[Amit Varma]: that you'd like to do that and you mentioned what it meant for you to receive all of that and it's

02:32:48.600 --> 02:32:56.360
[Amit Varma]: hard to sort of look back and kind of try to reconstruct this or whatever but how important

02:32:56.360 --> 02:33:06.120
[Amit Varma]: do you feel things like that were in sort of shaping the way you related to people understanding

02:33:06.120 --> 02:33:11.480
[Amit Varma]: yourself because every time you sit down to write something you you you get to know yourself a little

02:33:11.480 --> 02:33:17.960
[Amit Varma]: bit a bit better in that act so how important was that kind of writing to you and do you feel that

02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:22.760
[Amit Varma]: you lost like when now when you say that i like to do more of it is it because you stopped and

02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:30.200
[Guest]: didn't do enough of it at some point and you feel that it would help you know i like to kind of make

02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:34.600
[Guest]: two comparisons one to your earlier earlier question and this one that there's something

02:33:34.600 --> 02:33:40.600
[Guest]: very very similar between the art of conversation and the art of letter writing and i was very lucky

02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:47.000
[Guest]: to grow up with fine conversationalists so i mean whether it's my father or my grandfather

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:53.560
[Guest]: or another person who was very close to us H.M. Sirvai who was my father's senior and his son

02:33:53.560 --> 02:34:00.440
[Guest]: Navrose Sirvai who continues to be a very dear friend there was joy in conversation so and that

02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:08.360
[Guest]: conversation was personal political books poetry all of it intertwined so you realize that the time

02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:16.200
[Guest]: you spend together with such people and my father spent a lot of time with his chambermates what's

02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:21.880
[Guest]: lawyers call their chambermates so the parties for juniors were like big occasions for us because

02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:27.000
[Guest]: not only would a lot of good food be planned but there would be lots of very lively conversation

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:34.600
[Guest]: so all the family friends we had all the chamber friends we had conversations were very important

02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:40.840
[Guest]: and these were not conversations about Shadi and Bihar and Dowry but they were conversations about

02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:46.360
[Guest]: life about what was happening around the emergency i mean the emergency was a huge thing

02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:52.680
[Guest]: in our childhood you know i've written about it also but i mean for me it was a formative moment

02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:59.720
[Guest]: when i'm in standard 10 in 77 when the elections are called and you have your parents both telling

02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:06.280
[Guest]: you that listen your studies are not as important as your campaigning to get this government out

02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:11.480
[Guest]: and you know in the pre-emergency in sorry in the pre-election period during the emergency

02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:18.520
[Guest]: it was the homes of the Settlewad and the Chaglas and the Bhatkals in Bombay that all these meetings

02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:22.520
[Guest]: would take place as to how the Janata party can come back and we need to get this government out

02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:29.480
[Guest]: and etc so you know that that's a heavy dose of life and politicization that happens and then

02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:36.440
[Guest]: you're out by public transport going to the Bhatkals place in Prabhadevi picking up posters

02:35:36.440 --> 02:35:42.120
[Guest]: and plastering posters all over town and the matter of great pride that Bombay returns six

02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:47.320
[Guest]: seats to the Janata party you know that so that sort of thing now these things don't happen just

02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:52.920
[Guest]: like that they happen as a lot of conversation my first letter to the editor in the India Today

02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:59.800
[Guest]: today was about Indira Gandhi's growing authoritarianism in 1978 and stuff like that

02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:06.200
[Guest]: so you know all of this is so much part of the same thing that you're thinking you're conversing

02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:11.160
[Guest]: you're learning through those conversations you have the benefit of some fine minds whom you're

02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:17.560
[Guest]: conversing with all the time I mean I became a life member of the PUCL at 15 years because my

02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:24.120
[Guest]: father paid the cheque for it and because he knew I was passionate about civil liberties so you know

02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:29.080
[Guest]: all of this is getting imbibed at various levels and you're writing you're writing by hand so I

02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:36.040
[Guest]: have my notes my essays my diary notes my letters to people and of course always encouraged by my

02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:42.200
[Guest]: mother to write letters to grandparents and others so writing and communicating was always

02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:47.160
[Guest]: important you know I mean the gift was not important but the letter was important and I was

02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:51.640
[Guest]: writing even before the JLT I was writing a lot at least once or twice a year I'd write long

02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:57.240
[Guest]: handwritten letters to close friends and family whom I felt like saying something to but after

02:36:57.240 --> 02:37:01.320
[Guest]: this experience I want to do it much more because now I feel it has to be something that has to

02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:06.360
[Guest]: become part of your life again it cannot be just something that you do to just say thank you for

02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:13.240
[Guest]: those letters but to try and continue because it is an important exercise to get some nice handmade

02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:19.960
[Guest]: paper from Chimanalaz to think of that letter pad write it out or recycle paper from an

02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:26.200
[Guest]: organization that does recycling work and and write it because I think it's that communication

02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:31.880
[Guest]: that receipt the receiving of that letter is so important and there's an old family friend of

02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:37.640
[Guest]: ours who lives in San Francisco and she half her half her time is spent in and that family is also

02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:43.000
[Guest]: in my very important part of my upbringing was my my mother's best school friend was Preeti Desai

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:49.800
[Guest]: and her three sisters Jyoti, Sita and Bindu and one brother were like family to her and my father

02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:54.680
[Guest]: so we lots of holidays together and Bindu was Preeti and Bindu were like my political mentors

02:37:55.800 --> 02:38:01.320
[Guest]: cuttings about Palestine and cuttings about resistance in South Latin America South America

02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:05.080
[Guest]: all of that would come from the Guardian and the time that they would get and they would send it to

02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:13.640
[Guest]: me to read these we've lost the others but Sita's are there but Bindu is so much part of my life

02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:20.680
[Guest]: still she I got maybe five ten postcards from her in jail and she wrote to many of her academic and

02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:25.720
[Guest]: doctor friends all over the world who then wrote to me when I was inside so you know there's so

02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:32.200
[Guest]: much of this which is so important and continues to be important and why is it important only

02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:37.320
[Guest]: because you feel important at that moment or you feel loved no I think through every postcard that

02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:42.680
[Guest]: you get or letter that you get there is an idea there's a thought we are making a connection

02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:48.200
[Guest]: so Dilip D'Souza when he writes to you will be writing about his visit to Portugal where he saw

02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:52.440
[Guest]: that particular monument where he's which is writing about in the postcard that makes you

02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:56.280
[Guest]: reflect on that then you think of Mario Miranda and his postcard you know there's so many things

02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:02.520
[Guest]: that happen to you when you are reading and writing letters and the first letter I got in

02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:10.040
[Guest]: jail was on 27th of July and that was in an envelope and it was from Son Badra it was from

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:17.080
[Guest]: the Adivasi union leaders women leaders Rajkumari and eight nine others had Angutha chapped it and

02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:24.040
[Guest]: they had written out this letter and it the my fellow inmates in the barrack six were saying

02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:28.760
[Guest]: what are all these letters why are you getting so many so then I would tell them about the women

02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:33.960
[Guest]: who have written them who's Rajkumari and who's Sukalo so about for an hour that conversation

02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:38.760
[Guest]: would take place till interest would wane I said no these are amazingly fantastic women you would

02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:43.240
[Guest]: never meet such women in your life they live in this thing they're fighting for their land and

02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:48.920
[Guest]: this thing writes they've been in jail twice I've been jailed only the first time so you know all

02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:56.840
[Guest]: these comparisons analogies become extremely important I don't know what it meant to my

02:39:57.480 --> 02:40:01.880
[Guest]: fellow inmates in barrack six but those conversations were very important to me to have

02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:10.440
[Amit Varma]: with them. Wow that's so fascinating another sort of strand I want to kind of pick up on where you

02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:15.960
[Amit Varma]: mentioned how it meant a lot to you to be living by the sea that you know you would have that sense

02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:21.400
[Amit Varma]: of calm and all of that and you've also spoken about times where you know you just like to be

02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:28.200
[Amit Varma]: yourself cooking or be with yourself doing something with your hands and one thing I

02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:33.160
[Amit Varma]: wonder then is that how in one's life especially if someone is as engaged with the world as you

02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:37.720
[Amit Varma]: are where you're always busy doing something organizing something speaking to people you know

02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:44.680
[Amit Varma]: how do you manage to make space for that heraav in your life like sometimes you know you just want to

02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:51.480
[Amit Varma]: sit back and sink into yourself and just find a moment of calm where your monkey mind is quiet

02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:57.160
[Amit Varma]: so to say and at the same time you have so many things to do which are not unpleasant things

02:40:57.160 --> 02:41:01.800
[Amit Varma]: to do you're passionate about it you wake up looking forward to doing them how have you kind

02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:08.280
[Amit Varma]: of managed that because you know what someone like me will know of you from the outside is someone

02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:14.520
[Amit Varma]: who's always involved and you know in your activism in your writing all of that but there is also a

02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:20.360
[Amit Varma]: private self sometimes you just want to chill sometimes you just want to blank mind look how

02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:25.080
[Amit Varma]: do you how do you manage these is it frustrating sometimes where there's just too much I never have

02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:30.040
[Guest]: enough time in the day it's like horrible it's horrible I'm always fighting and I think I'm

02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:36.440
[Guest]: driving everybody berserk with it because I'm trying to cram in maybe 40 things to do in a day

02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:41.800
[Guest]: when I can only do 10 and it's like very very tough and ask my family they go berserk with me

02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:46.280
[Guest]: because I make they they've seen this they've grown up with this so it must have been very

02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:54.120
[Guest]: tough for them but yeah but I do zealously try to grab my private moments and then my family

02:41:54.120 --> 02:42:00.600
[Guest]: tries to make me grab them too so that I try and get them but the holidays unfortunately have become

02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:05.480
[Guest]: less than they ought to be the earlier we used to be very very this thing about having family

02:42:05.480 --> 02:42:10.440
[Guest]: holidays three weeks a year three weeks in a year whatever but they have lessened a lot so

02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:15.720
[Guest]: those are kind of big big sacrifices that one has had to make in the last seven eight nine years

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:21.560
[Guest]: hopefully that will change one keeps telling oneself that one needs to get that to change

02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:25.960
[Guest]: because I don't think those three weeks are going to make a difference but but it's tough

02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:31.400
[Guest]: so one just it's a tussle with oneself and as you kind of tell oneself about health also look after

02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:39.080
[Guest]: yourself all those things are a battle and I think my family has paid a price for this frenetic level

02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:47.240
[Guest]: of activity but I also feel that one is lucky to at least have the space and the place that one can

02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:52.520
[Guest]: sit up and sit one never had the pressures of not having a home or having to pay a loan for the home

02:42:52.520 --> 02:42:57.560
[Guest]: and I think I always recognize that that you know one is lucky activist in that sense and at least

02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:05.560
[Guest]: this fallback cushion was there and maybe that's why one can do more or should do more so you

02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:09.880
[Amit Varma]: mentioned how you know you decided you wanted to be a journalist when you read all the president's

02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:14.840
[Amit Varma]: men and then you know you got into college and you threw yourself into student politics you

02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:20.120
[Amit Varma]: protested free rise you were active in debating you were part of the film society all of that

02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:25.720
[Amit Varma]: tell me a little bit about what was your developing conception of yourself like when I think of myself

02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:30.760
[Amit Varma]: in college I mean I would have no way of answering that question because everything was a confused

02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:37.080
[Amit Varma]: hazy mess and you're just kind of going with the flow and whatever but in your case you know there

02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:45.240
[Amit Varma]: seems to be more purpose to kind of what you're doing so what was that period like like were you

02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:49.320
[Amit Varma]: so clear that you're going to be a journalist that this is just like a waiting period graduation

02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:56.760
[Guest]: get the degree and then I think college for me was a flowering of my personality so I think that

02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:01.080
[Guest]: journalism would have come later I was not looking at that state I was just enjoying every moment of

02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:08.280
[Guest]: that thing of a kind of an educational space and institution where you were challenged by the

02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:12.920
[Guest]: curriculum but not enough not to do lots of extracurricular stuff political engagement

02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:17.080
[Guest]: because those are the times when campuses were political and I think that's one of the

02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:21.960
[Guest]: linking up to your earlier question I think one of the reasons why you have this hopeless

02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:27.960
[Guest]: depoliticization of the middle class is the this whole lindow committee business not having

02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:33.320
[Guest]: elections in colleges and a completely depoliticization of the campus because I think

02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:38.280
[Guest]: the only politics that happens in campuses is ultra-right politics and that's that's really sad

02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:44.600
[Guest]: it's really really sad because there's a whole crop of us generations who got politicized on

02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:50.680
[Guest]: campus because that's the age right you're out of school you're on your own your mind is growing

02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:58.120
[Guest]: you're you're experimenting breaking away from what your family has stood for all of that is natural

02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:03.800
[Guest]: and I think that was so important to me Elfie years Elphinstone years were like really important

02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:09.240
[Guest]: for my formation in terms of what I became afterwards and what the these the the work

02:45:09.240 --> 02:45:17.640
[Guest]: I did afterwards and my engagement with student politics issues I mean I mean we saw so many

02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:21.960
[Guest]: lovely I mean I wish I could see the films that I saw there number of films I seen I can't see them

02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:27.800
[Guest]: I don't have the time but we saw the most glorious films I mean apart from really good solid classics

02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:34.840
[Guest]: and art films we saw I mean we saw three films a week in theaters you know and we bunk classes but

02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:40.760
[Guest]: we were very active on the campus and we had very good professors so they knew their tutorials would

02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:47.480
[Guest]: be submitted but not always we attended in class it was a fantastic atmosphere and I think we

02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:53.800
[Guest]: really need to fight to get our campuses back to a space in a stage by which really good politics

02:45:53.800 --> 02:46:00.760
[Guest]: can happen where the politics of equality and non-discrimination can be arenas in the campus

02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:05.240
[Guest]: because where else can you learn this you know imagine I mean I'm coming out of Manikji Cooper

02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:11.960
[Guest]: school and I'm going to Elphinstone and I'm engaging with the this whole question of feed

02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:16.280
[Guest]: eyes and of course but I'm also telling the political organization that is talking about

02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:23.160
[Guest]: feed eyes that please also raise the question of English language privilege because I'm already got

02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:29.800
[Guest]: a 20 point handicap over somebody who studied in the non-English languages because I can I can sail

02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:35.160
[Guest]: through my 11th and 12th without even opening my textbook if I'm not interested in getting 90 percent

02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:40.360
[Guest]: I can get at least 50 60 70 percent because of the wretched English language privilege so let's also

02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:45.720
[Guest]: battle for some sort of handicap marks for those persons who are not coming from you know so all

02:46:45.720 --> 02:46:51.640
[Guest]: those issues get crystallized if you are able to articulate them in that kind of space how many

02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:56.440
[Guest]: kids are given that in a commerce college today or in a science college today is there that kind

02:46:56.440 --> 02:47:03.720
[Guest]: of articulation possible we saw it during CA and NRC and we know the potential is there I mean the

02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:10.120
[Guest]: gathering we saw at August Kanti Maidan and then at Gateway for a deep politicized city like Bombay

02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:16.520
[Guest]: was tremendous so the potential among young people is always there but I think we need to also revive

02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:22.360
[Amit Varma]: politics on the campus to make this consistent. I guess you're saying this from you know an

02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:27.640
[Amit Varma]: Elphinstone upbringing point of view but the counterpoint to this would be so many campuses

02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:33.960
[Amit Varma]: in north and central India where you know politics just leads to violence and I guess the kind of

02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:37.960
[Amit Varma]: politics you have also depends on the kind of society you're in and the kind of people that

02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:42.440
[Guest]: there are you know those are not. See this is like a teacher telling me when we are doing teacher

02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:48.280
[Guest]: training on Koj and we say that Koj's principle is pedagogy multi-dimensional and we must bring

02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:52.840
[Guest]: conflictual issues into the classroom because to believe as an adult that the young mind has no

02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:58.200
[Guest]: capacity to deal with conflict is as an ageist prejudice you know so this is one of the discussions

02:47:58.200 --> 02:48:03.160
[Guest]: and trainings we have so many teachers say but you know you're talking about a very noisy classroom

02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:08.280
[Guest]: so I said yeah but it's the right kind of noise it's the noise that means questioning so to answer

02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:12.680
[Guest]: your question it's the kind of what kind of politics if you're talking about politics of the

02:48:12.680 --> 02:48:17.080
[Guest]: mob then obviously what you're saying is true that's why I said that the only politics left on

02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:22.440
[Guest]: the campus is right-wing politics but but if you're talking about the politics of organization

02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:27.160
[Guest]: the politics of constitutionalism the question of make deepening the constitution deepening

02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:31.800
[Guest]: democracy then this is the age to do it I mean you have to question your structures now and here

02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:37.640
[Guest]: now and learn how to do it and experiment with how to do it you might make mistakes but that's

02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:43.880
[Guest]: how you kind of get because I think to ensure that all our citizens forever remain politically

02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:50.680
[Guest]: active the campus is very important and we have to have politically actives I'm not talking about

02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:58.520
[Guest]: party politics but politically active citizenry is what strengthens democracy. So as we sort of

02:48:58.520 --> 02:49:03.320
[Amit Varma]: segue from your college years to actually joining journalism let me also ask you a larger question

02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:08.680
[Amit Varma]: about journalism which ties into your point about the importance of politics and political thinking

02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:15.640
[Amit Varma]: I did a recent episode with the journalist Samarth Bansal you know and one of the questions that we

02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:23.320
[Amit Varma]: sort of debated was just the meta question of what should a journalist report on because you know

02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:31.480
[Amit Varma]: a journalist or a publication can really write about anything but you choose to write about

02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:37.800
[Amit Varma]: some things and not about others and and that choice is aesthetic ethical political all of

02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:44.280
[Amit Varma]: these things everything kind of comes into it and this is something that I think increasingly we

02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:48.600
[Amit Varma]: need to think more about and you of course bemoaned and I share your lament of what is happening to

02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:57.480
[Amit Varma]: the media today and the spaces that they've vacated but on this larger question what has

02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:03.960
[Amit Varma]: been your evolving sense of it that if as a journalist you you have to think about what do

02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:09.720
[Amit Varma]: I write about you know or if as an editor you're saying what are the stories we will publish today

02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:17.400
[Amit Varma]: what will we put on page one and why you know what would your answer be today and how would

02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:22.360
[Amit Varma]: it have evolved over time and I understand that obviously there are nuances here like what is your

02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:27.560
[Amit Varma]: market or who are you speaking to and are you a tabloid or a broadsheet and obviously all of those

02:50:27.560 --> 02:50:35.240
[Amit Varma]: nuances are there but in general I think that you know there are many of us who are searching

02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:40.840
[Amit Varma]: for an answer to the question that goes beyond the functional one of what does the market want

02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:47.640
[Amit Varma]: what will sell most copies you know what is trending on twitter you know so is there so

02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:53.960
[Amit Varma]: how do you sort of look at this and how has your thinking on this evolved like where are you and

02:50:53.960 --> 02:50:59.320
[Guest]: how did you get here see I think as a practicing journalist I need to explain to all of you

02:50:59.320 --> 02:51:04.360
[Guest]: because you know you have probably not seen it from the inside I've been a practicing journalist

02:51:04.360 --> 02:51:08.760
[Guest]: as well but never mind no but I just want to say that I think what is often forgotten is that you

02:51:08.760 --> 02:51:15.320
[Guest]: know how is the whole concept of the fourth estate evolved I mean the fourth estate both internationally

02:51:15.320 --> 02:51:23.080
[Guest]: and nationally within India and South Asia it's evolved as an entity or a thing which is

02:51:23.080 --> 02:51:28.440
[Guest]: outside the state which is for which is by its very inherent nature anti-establishment and needs

02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:34.520
[Guest]: to question structures of state and society so you need the independence you need autonomy etc

02:51:34.520 --> 02:51:39.640
[Guest]: then as you evolve further and you get into a democratic setup you know you have this notion of

02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:49.240
[Guest]: ensuring that the journalist or the media and we begin with print then we move to electronic

02:51:49.240 --> 02:51:56.680
[Guest]: and digital should be equipped to question every governance structure that exists within that

02:51:56.680 --> 02:52:03.400
[Guest]: democracy right now having said that step back for a minute and look at the way our national

02:52:03.400 --> 02:52:08.840
[Guest]: movement and the freedom movement given what I was saying earlier where you have our best leaders

02:52:09.480 --> 02:52:16.680
[Guest]: and even the using media for political mobilization so Gandhi as an editor Gandhi as a writer but

02:52:16.680 --> 02:52:22.840
[Guest]: there's young India Harijan all the publications he edited Babasaheb Ambedkar edited like 15

02:52:22.840 --> 02:52:28.520
[Guest]: Mukhnayak so many of them so many of them and each one of them had a different stage and evolution

02:52:28.520 --> 02:52:35.880
[Guest]: so on the one hand I'm talking about the post independence what it ought to be or should be

02:52:36.440 --> 02:52:41.720
[Guest]: what it has become we'll come to later and what it has meant in terms of political emancipation I

02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:49.400
[Guest]: also flagged so it's very important to understand that the focus needs to always that of course the

02:52:49.400 --> 02:52:55.720
[Guest]: editorial in terms of comment and comment writing or feature writing is important but I think the

02:52:55.720 --> 02:53:03.160
[Guest]: journalists and publications and television channels and portals should never forget the

02:53:03.160 --> 02:53:10.600
[Guest]: primary duty is to report now reportage means what reportage means understanding the structure

02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:15.880
[Guest]: of society and state and having meticulous independent autonomous coverage of it okay

02:53:16.440 --> 02:53:23.160
[Guest]: so in traditional terms what this meant for us when we began was beat reporting okay beat reporting

02:53:23.160 --> 02:53:27.480
[Guest]: and what I would like to flag today is and I say this all the time because I take journalism

02:53:27.480 --> 02:53:35.080
[Guest]: classes also is I really bemoan the complete obfuscation and eradication of beat reporting

02:53:36.200 --> 02:53:42.280
[Guest]: today and I think this is very important so what am I saying here that you traditionally

02:53:42.280 --> 02:53:46.040
[Guest]: and there were lacunas there also it was not perfect so we'll come to that in a minute

02:53:46.040 --> 02:53:50.920
[Guest]: but what do I mean by I mean that how did we begin when we began as cub reporters or

02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:55.960
[Guest]: trainee reporter you begin with the crime beat then you go to the corporation beat then you

02:53:55.960 --> 02:54:02.040
[Guest]: I'm talking about cities then you go to the university beat then there's also health beat

02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:07.640
[Guest]: and then there's also science beat for the experts and there's also legal beat law beat

02:54:07.640 --> 02:54:11.400
[Guest]: court beat and there's of course the pinnacle which is everybody aspires to the political

02:54:11.400 --> 02:54:17.080
[Guest]: mantra elevator the vedan sudha beat or the parliament beat so these were the traditional

02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:21.640
[Guest]: I'm saying even then some of us were questioning like for instance we formed the women and media

02:54:21.640 --> 02:54:26.760
[Guest]: committee which I write about then there were the labor writers and all even then we would

02:54:26.760 --> 02:54:33.880
[Guest]: be moaning the fact that there was not enough attention paid to the labor beat workers issues

02:54:33.880 --> 02:54:39.240
[Guest]: agricultural beat no attention at all even that time or very little maybe sporadically when there

02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:44.760
[Guest]: was a drought but not as a big beat so farmers issues were not regularly covered agricultural

02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:50.200
[Guest]: issues were there was no environment and climate change was never really an issue you know so even

02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:55.560
[Guest]: then all this was being deepened and questioned but my point is that the beat journalism is gone

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:02.200
[Guest]: never mind that those that didn't exist or were eroded didn't didn't exist even then you know

02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:06.760
[Guest]: so I think one of the things we really need to flag again today when we are looking at alternatives

02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:14.760
[Guest]: and your own experience Amit with this entire podcast is actually a reflection of this that

02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:19.640
[Guest]: to say that the market doesn't want it is bullshit you know I really whether it's with

02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:25.800
[Guest]: Bollywood and the kind of films being trashed out or whether it is media I don't buy that

02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:31.240
[Guest]: because who is deciding and who is giving we know the game of advertising what it was I mean it was

02:55:31.240 --> 02:55:35.320
[Guest]: it was all a bubble you told yourself that this is what worked and you told yourself this was the

02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:41.240
[Guest]: market wanted we know the world of TRPs where we know whether TRPs are represented or there

02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:45.800
[Guest]: enough critical studies on that so I think let's come back to the fact that who is honest enough

02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:51.480
[Guest]: to actually return to being a decent newspaper or a decent television channel or whatever and

02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:55.800
[Guest]: who is willing to back that financially because the issue really is ownership money and all of

02:55:55.800 --> 02:56:00.840
[Guest]: that which is what Vaya is trying to do that you know that funding by the viewer and all of that

02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:04.520
[Guest]: all experiments in the making we don't know if they're going to succeed in the long term

02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:08.840
[Guest]: scroll we just hope they do because if they don't then I think we are sunk because what little

02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:14.360
[Guest]: options we have will go so I think I'll return that I think there's looking at this entire

02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:21.720
[Guest]: business about number one reportage being as important as comment and when I mean by reportage

02:56:21.720 --> 02:56:27.480
[Guest]: I'm not about just individual fragmented stories but through those individual stories you're

02:56:27.480 --> 02:56:31.960
[Guest]: actually picking up trends you're picking up this thing and then you're doing an analysis

02:56:31.960 --> 02:56:36.440
[Guest]: so from the reportage comes the knowledge of analysis not just sitting in a editor's chair

02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:41.000
[Guest]: and doing the analysis with no knowledge of what's happening on the ground so today for instance and

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:46.040
[Guest]: this is what I found so tragic and many of us were still involved with the Bombay Union of

02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:51.400
[Guest]: Journalists and the Delhi Union of Journalists is that you know 475 to 500 journalists lost their

02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:59.160
[Guest]: lives during COVID and it's not a national story just as you had nurses and Anganmadi workers and

02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:04.760
[Guest]: health workers who risked their lives so did journalists but it's not a story even for the

02:57:04.760 --> 02:57:11.240
[Guest]: media why would it be for politicians so you know I think this is where the huge disconnect lies

02:57:11.240 --> 02:57:16.120
[Guest]: that there are still journalists who want to do their job there's still journalists who are trying

02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:20.920
[Guest]: to do their job there's still journalists who are actually sacrificing lives for the job but they

02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:29.400
[Guest]: just don't get the visibility or the or the or the respect that they deserve maybe that was always

02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:34.360
[Guest]: the case but it is far more acute today so I'm just saying that you know so crisis reporting

02:57:34.360 --> 02:57:41.480
[Guest]: conflict reporting beat reporting and reporting before and no overemphasis on comment will itself

02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:48.440
[Guest]: sort of bring down the hysteria levels and the hate levels because I think facts speak stronger

02:57:48.440 --> 02:57:54.280
[Guest]: than words and many of the things that I'm talking about will actually the syncretism the

02:57:54.280 --> 02:58:00.120
[Guest]: lived secularism of people will also get reflected in those stories you know which is why there's a

02:58:00.120 --> 02:58:05.080
[Guest]: group of people in Tamil Nadu started this thing of My India or whatever they just report on all

02:58:05.080 --> 02:58:08.840
[Guest]: the good news stories because that's the other thing many of us used to feel as reporters that

02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:14.600
[Guest]: bad news is news but good news is no news you know so so much of this needs to be brought back

02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:20.680
[Guest]: to the debate obviously forms will change because media has changed so I'm not saying we go back in

02:58:20.680 --> 02:58:26.440
[Guest]: the in this go back four decades or three decades or two decades but we re-examine the proposition

02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:31.800
[Guest]: that are we doing justice to reportage and if reportage has to be engaged in fairly today

02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:39.240
[Guest]: of the various structures of governance how do we do it and if this is an age of shared news and

02:58:39.240 --> 02:58:44.840
[Guest]: syndication and shared platforms can this be done collectively I think these are some of the

02:58:44.840 --> 02:58:49.720
[Guest]: challenges that we need to do because the digital portals are trying it you know so you have a

02:58:49.720 --> 02:58:55.160
[Guest]: mukhnayak you have a wire you have very very interesting experiments you have a that Khabar

02:58:55.160 --> 02:59:01.080
[Guest]: Lahariya you have Gaon Ke Log many small and big interesting experiments taking place in the non

02:59:01.080 --> 02:59:09.640
[Guest]: in the non-english arena as well but this is no match for the kind of bombardment and this thing

02:59:09.640 --> 02:59:15.000
[Guest]: that we get from our electronic commercial channels I will I refuse to call them mainstream

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:20.200
[Guest]: anymore they are commercial they're pure commerce so how does one counter this that is a huge

02:59:20.200 --> 02:59:24.600
[Guest]: challenge and of course some of our best journalistic minds are engaged in it but are they

02:59:24.600 --> 02:59:31.160
[Amit Varma]: enough you know so you know a couple of profound points which I want to underscore and the first

02:59:31.160 --> 02:59:36.600
[Amit Varma]: of them which might you know to the casual listener it might seem that hey what difference

02:59:36.600 --> 02:59:40.840
[Amit Varma]: does it make if there aren't beat if there isn't beat journalism but it's incredibly important and

02:59:40.840 --> 02:59:45.000
[Amit Varma]: I want to read out this passage from your book where you wrote about it where you wrote quote

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:49.320
[Amit Varma]: I believe I was among the last generation of reporters to benefit from training on the beat

02:59:49.320 --> 02:59:53.640
[Amit Varma]: the loss of this structured framework has seminally reduced the quality and standards of

02:59:53.640 --> 02:59:58.680
[Amit Varma]: the profession we honed our skills as observers and critics of the system by talking to people

02:59:58.680 --> 03:00:03.400
[Amit Varma]: in the university in the municipal corporation the bmc beat in the mantra lay the seat of the

03:00:03.400 --> 03:00:07.960
[Amit Varma]: state government or in the courts we listen to court proceedings and debates in the assembly

03:00:07.960 --> 03:00:13.000
[Amit Varma]: to cover the courts to understand and report on the issues being contested meant plowing through

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:18.360
[Amit Varma]: court records petitions and affidavit annexures it was not only about flippant oral comments made

03:00:18.360 --> 03:00:23.080
[Amit Varma]: in the courtroom each encounter allowed us to understand better the way these structures worked

03:00:23.080 --> 03:00:27.560
[Amit Varma]: in our democracy mundane beat reporting allowed us to pour through the agenda of the standing

03:00:27.560 --> 03:00:32.840
[Amit Varma]: committee meetings of the municipal council or to sense a pulse behind the assembly sessions

03:00:32.840 --> 03:00:38.440
[Amit Varma]: our exclusives our front pages had to be built on long hours of hectic consultations learning

03:00:38.440 --> 03:00:45.640
[Amit Varma]: and questioning stop quote and and the importance of this is that there is a deep engagement like

03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:49.720
[Amit Varma]: what I see happened like one of the things that has gone wrong with media today in addition to

03:00:49.720 --> 03:00:54.760
[Amit Varma]: many others but one of the things is that too many journalists today are generalists

03:00:55.400 --> 03:01:01.720
[Amit Varma]: right the new publications don't have budgets so you no longer have beats with dedicated reporters

03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:06.440
[Amit Varma]: one day you are reporting on bmc next day you're reporting from the hospital you're taking quotes

03:01:06.440 --> 03:01:11.320
[Amit Varma]: from people without getting quotes from five other people you are not questioning anything

03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:17.640
[Amit Varma]: it's it's become that kind of shallow reportage and the reason this matters is that I agree with

03:01:17.640 --> 03:01:24.120
[Amit Varma]: you that one of the functions of the media is to speak truth to power and to me the key word there

03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:28.760
[Amit Varma]: is truth right and how do you arrive at the truth you arrive at the truth by going as deep as

03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:34.600
[Amit Varma]: possible by gathering as many dots as you can so you you can build a sufficiently high definition

03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:39.960
[Amit Varma]: picture and again I say in truth to power the truth bit is important because it's also dangerous

03:01:39.960 --> 03:01:49.000
[Amit Varma]: to go in the other direction and you know become sort of become oppositional for the sake of it and

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:56.680
[Amit Varma]: and we've seen that happening as well and the other profound point you made is about new ways of

03:01:56.680 --> 03:02:03.960
[Amit Varma]: perhaps collective reporting arising and I've been thinking a lot about in the creator economy

03:02:03.960 --> 03:02:09.640
[Amit Varma]: how new ways of expression are coming like I don't think there is any more any sense in any

03:02:09.640 --> 03:02:14.120
[Amit Varma]: of us hoping that the big publications are mainstream publications will deliver they're

03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:18.920
[Amit Varma]: not going to do that they have their pressures they have their incentives fine it is what it

03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:22.920
[Amit Varma]: is but we have the tools of production in our hand you know you mentioned my podcast listen

03:02:22.920 --> 03:02:26.760
[Amit Varma]: you know as an editor if I was I were to go to any mainstream house and say

03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:34.200
[Amit Varma]: I would be laughed out of the room right but there are so many people like me who don't have to

03:02:34.200 --> 03:02:40.600
[Amit Varma]: to conform to a particular conventional way of thinking who don't have to go through gatekeepers

03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:45.240
[Amit Varma]: and I think just as in the creator economy and really there's a thin line between creating and

03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:50.920
[Amit Varma]: reporting and all of this that I do see hope coming there you know the likes of Khabar Lahariya for

03:02:50.920 --> 03:02:55.720
[Guest]: example and so on absolutely that and I really feel that we should be talking on lines of this

03:02:55.720 --> 03:03:01.720
[Guest]: collaboration and syndication of this work because and complementing and complementarity

03:03:01.720 --> 03:03:07.160
[Guest]: because I think the time for these big mega be be everywhere stories are not going to work so

03:03:07.160 --> 03:03:11.560
[Guest]: how can we share and it's happening people are doing it is people are doing it in a very

03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:16.200
[Guest]: collaborative way it's just that it's a it's begun so I'm hoping that it'll get there at

03:03:16.200 --> 03:03:23.480
[Guest]: some point you know and I feel I feel very very positive vibes from a very small section

03:03:23.480 --> 03:03:28.360
[Guest]: of creators plus digital alternate portals who are really trying to do this and doing it

03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:33.960
[Guest]: respecting each other's spaces respecting each other's values and not counting yourself in terms

03:03:33.960 --> 03:03:40.360
[Guest]: of who's big and who's got the maximum money or whatever but in terms of who's a genuine journalist

03:03:40.360 --> 03:03:45.960
[Guest]: and what is a journalist at the end of the day you know so I think it's it's very very important

03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:50.920
[Guest]: to that and I think this reflection is very important and this articulation is very important

03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:55.800
[Guest]: that we keep asking ourselves that are we doing enough reportage are we going out there to talk

03:03:55.800 --> 03:04:01.640
[Guest]: to people and do it because that is that is what used to get us the anchor stories and the

03:04:01.640 --> 03:04:11.400
[Guest]: testing stories and the analysis I mean 87 when 1987 when Express sent me to South Rajasthan

03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:16.280
[Guest]: to cover the drought where there were this horrendous starvation deaths as well

03:04:17.320 --> 03:04:23.160
[Guest]: starvation killings actually where a father actually you know sent his wife home and I mean

03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:29.640
[Guest]: I'll never forget you know and but but that learning of that entire 10 days stays with you

03:04:29.640 --> 03:04:35.240
[Guest]: for the for your life I mean even now how to report how to understand and how to understand

03:04:35.240 --> 03:04:41.000
[Guest]: what you don't know so have that humility that you do not know this issue completely you're a

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:45.960
[Guest]: journalist so you're reporting it there's always more to know about it and you have to have the

03:04:45.960 --> 03:04:51.080
[Guest]: humility to know that more you know so read read up as much as you can and have respect for that

03:04:51.080 --> 03:04:56.440
[Guest]: expert on the ground or the expertise on the ground which is fighting it. So you joined

03:04:56.440 --> 03:05:02.520
[Amit Varma]: Russi Karanja as a daily in 1983 and 1984 you speak about how covering the communal violence in

03:05:02.520 --> 03:05:08.760
[Amit Varma]: Mumbai was a huge turning point like you've got a para and I won't even read it out about the

03:05:08.760 --> 03:05:14.120
[Amit Varma]: violence you saw at cheetah camp in Govandi and it's just just horrendous I'd encourage

03:05:14.120 --> 03:05:23.240
[Amit Varma]: everyone to read your book anyway what was that period like was it was covering that communal

03:05:23.240 --> 03:05:29.320
[Amit Varma]: violence did it kind of change you how did you process all the things that you saw around you

03:05:29.320 --> 03:05:35.400
[Amit Varma]: how did you kind of make sense of it tell me a little bit about that at that period.

03:05:36.520 --> 03:05:41.400
[Guest]: I mentioned earlier if you remember that 86 was so important that whole 83 to 86 period is also

03:05:41.400 --> 03:05:46.920
[Guest]: where the whole build-up was happening and I was covering Bombay and Javed was covering Bhivandi

03:05:47.480 --> 03:05:54.200
[Guest]: because Bombay Bhivandi happened at the same time and you know you how to report it how to how to

03:05:54.200 --> 03:05:59.880
[Guest]: put it down where the horror is not concealed from your reader but you don't become voyeuristic

03:06:02.200 --> 03:06:09.080
[Guest]: also kind of created a whole churning and trauma even that you know you you don't want this to

03:06:09.080 --> 03:06:14.680
[Guest]: remain at the level of just reportage that can you engage with it more and I think that is what led

03:06:14.680 --> 03:06:19.480
[Guest]: up to eventually what we're going to start doing many many years later you know particularly 92 93

03:06:19.480 --> 03:06:24.520
[Guest]: when activism also campaigning and activism also came into the play when our city burned and all

03:06:24.520 --> 03:06:30.440
[Guest]: of that but I think the understanding and the engagement with this kind of targeted violence

03:06:30.440 --> 03:06:36.840
[Guest]: and the horror of it you know unexpectedness of it it can just hit anybody anywhere and not anybody

03:06:36.840 --> 03:06:45.240
[Guest]: anyway it's of course some people somewhere but you just read up much more about and I also I

03:06:45.240 --> 03:06:50.280
[Guest]: have to say this that I learned so much from my mentors in journalism so I remember that for me

03:06:50.280 --> 03:06:55.320
[Guest]: I was and that was another tradition we grew up with as journalists that you always had a mentor

03:06:55.320 --> 03:07:01.400
[Guest]: so the best minds in Marathi journalism were my mentors I mentioned Jagan already there was D.K

03:07:01.400 --> 03:07:06.920
[Guest]: Riker who was my chief reporter in Express there was there was so many many senior journalists that

03:07:06.920 --> 03:07:11.880
[Guest]: one learned from and I particularly remember Madhu Shetty and S.B Kolpe because they were writing for

03:07:11.880 --> 03:07:18.440
[Guest]: tinier publications but when 92 93 happened you haven't come to that yet but I just wanted to

03:07:18.440 --> 03:07:25.640
[Guest]: mention that I started exploring this whole thing about you know this whole metaphor of who cast the

03:07:25.640 --> 03:07:30.680
[Guest]: first stone you know that and then this kind of tendency to blame it on the angry Muslim who did

03:07:30.680 --> 03:07:34.920
[Guest]: this here or did that here and then you start looking at that what happened just before that

03:07:34.920 --> 03:07:40.680
[Guest]: and you realize there's hate speech and there's hate writing and that whole the temperature of

03:07:42.600 --> 03:07:51.000
[Guest]: that demography whether it's a city or a region or a state is built up to that hate speech and hate

03:07:51.640 --> 03:07:58.440
[Guest]: writing for weeks and months before the first stone is cast so and now you have what all

03:07:58.440 --> 03:08:03.640
[Guest]: pervasive Facebook social media and all that so your geographic areas Lester showed us is like

03:08:03.640 --> 03:08:12.680
[Guest]: just everywhere so how are you going to deal with it so the the I think I started

03:08:15.080 --> 03:08:21.160
[Guest]: that engagement and then covering various bouts of violence after that November 84 when close

03:08:21.160 --> 03:08:26.360
[Guest]: friends were involved in the anti-sick violence and reporting and relief work in Delhi then Meerut

03:08:26.360 --> 03:08:33.560
[Guest]: Maliana Bhagalpur all happened 87-89 all of that became a kind of way to learn to read and learn

03:08:33.560 --> 03:08:39.080
[Guest]: more about this this beast what is this beast why is it happening again and again why is it making

03:08:39.080 --> 03:08:44.840
[Guest]: othering people amongst our own you know what I mean generation I mean we've already been through

03:08:44.840 --> 03:08:50.120
[Guest]: partition and partition related is it because that catharsis was not allowed to happen is it because

03:08:50.120 --> 03:08:54.920
[Guest]: we didn't discuss partition enough so all of those thoughts were forming and then you have 92 which

03:08:54.920 --> 03:09:02.360
[Guest]: is like a big blast I mean it was like crazy so it your analytical capacities as a journalist are

03:09:02.360 --> 03:09:07.160
[Guest]: growing side by side you're not thinking about just that reporting that incident but reporting

03:09:07.160 --> 03:09:12.520
[Guest]: on the phenomenon of communal violence which is why we started conducting classes on the

03:09:12.520 --> 03:09:16.360
[Guest]: historiography of communal violence at Xavier's Institute of Communications, Sophia and other

03:09:16.360 --> 03:09:21.320
[Guest]: things and I think I'm thinking of now putting those online because I think they're very important

03:09:21.320 --> 03:09:26.040
[Guest]: because institutes might feel too scared to touch the issue today but if they're online people will

03:09:26.040 --> 03:09:29.640
[Guest]: will listen and there will be journalists who'll want to learn and I think it's important to put

03:09:29.640 --> 03:09:35.720
[Guest]: it out there the kind of experience one has got so I remember this one conversation which is so

03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:41.240
[Guest]: important to me it was sitting at the press club with Madhu and S.B. Kolpe and they saw that I was

03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:46.520
[Guest]: I was frenetic after the 92-93 violence I was really both a journalist active doing whatever

03:09:46.520 --> 03:09:52.200
[Guest]: I could really upset I'd also done the police violence messages exposed that which showed the

03:09:52.200 --> 03:09:59.000
[Guest]: communal violence and you know Kolpe said just sit down and listen to me this is not entirely new

03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:04.680
[Guest]: and that's what I remember that conversation I've gone back to free press I've still not

03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:08.840
[Guest]: located that clipping but he went back to when he was a reporter in free press journal

03:10:08.840 --> 03:10:16.840
[Guest]: and he covered the first first round of post-independence 1961 Jabalpur and what did

03:10:16.840 --> 03:10:23.400
[Guest]: he tell me I've written about this also he told me that he was sent to cover it 10 days after

03:10:23.400 --> 03:10:29.560
[Guest]: the violence had been raging and there'd been a set narrative nationally okay what was the

03:10:29.560 --> 03:10:35.160
[Guest]: narrative that this Muslim BD worker had abducted this Hindu girl and therefore the communal violence

03:10:35.160 --> 03:10:42.040
[Guest]: broken out he goes there he's sent by his editor that you go there something is wrong you go there

03:10:42.040 --> 03:10:47.160
[Guest]: cover it properly he goes and he meets the superintendent of police he meets all the

03:10:47.160 --> 03:10:51.800
[Guest]: like we all are supposed to do in the beat and he I remember him telling me he said you know

03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:57.880
[Guest]: those days he was a Kashmiri Pandit he was Hindu and he told me he said listen all the damages

03:10:57.880 --> 03:11:04.360
[Guest]: damages being being generated by this one rag which is published here which is RSS affiliate

03:11:04.360 --> 03:11:08.600
[Guest]: which has started this narrative and all the publications are syndicating and picking up from

03:11:08.600 --> 03:11:15.480
[Guest]: there there's no independent government yes there were issues between the families but it was a love

03:11:15.480 --> 03:11:21.240
[Guest]: marriage but the class was different this guy was a working class he was a Hindu she was a

03:11:21.240 --> 03:11:25.960
[Guest]: middle class girl he was a working class boy so obviously there was angst on both sides that you

03:11:25.960 --> 03:11:31.800
[Guest]: know it's the love jihad of that time if you like but it was not conflictual in the sense that is

03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:38.840
[Guest]: being made out and then it was it was a periphery that got into the act and the violence broke out

03:11:39.400 --> 03:11:44.920
[Guest]: so he wrote those pieces two or three pieces for free press journal and he got a letter from Nehru

03:11:44.920 --> 03:11:49.880
[Guest]: Pandit Nehru saying that you know thank you for doing a national service to the country by putting

03:11:49.880 --> 03:11:57.560
[Guest]: right the narrative so you know that strengthened my conviction on that but journalists need to be

03:11:57.560 --> 03:12:02.920
[Guest]: trained on how to cover communal violence just because you're a decent journalist doesn't mean

03:12:02.920 --> 03:12:08.440
[Guest]: you'll get it right because it's a particular kind of beast there are forces and organizations at

03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:15.560
[Guest]: work who are trying to generate a viciousness within us who are trying to generate hate within

03:12:15.560 --> 03:12:22.840
[Guest]: us who are using hate speech as the currency as their currency so unless we no one are able to

03:12:22.840 --> 03:12:28.440
[Guest]: catch that and the police often don't tell you about it or project it right or even prosecute it

03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:34.600
[Guest]: because there's a there's a infiltration there so you have to be alive to all of this and there

03:12:34.600 --> 03:12:39.400
[Guest]: will also minority communalism which is feeding into all of this so you know all these dimensions

03:12:39.400 --> 03:12:44.200
[Guest]: unless we are aware of when we are entering the field you can't just cover it i mean i was lucky

03:12:44.200 --> 03:12:51.400
[Guest]: because i was sensitized like this i was at that time and then i went my trajectory way i read more

03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:58.040
[Guest]: i talked a lot of senior journalists read up all the commission reports uh all the judicial

03:12:58.040 --> 03:13:03.240
[Guest]: commission reports on communal violence so that developed my analytical thinking but how many

03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:10.120
[Amit Varma]: journalists will do that just like nehru wrote to your friend i hope one day modiji writes to you

03:13:10.120 --> 03:13:14.920
[Amit Varma]: and says trista thank you for your service to the nation but i won't hold my breath waiting for that

03:13:14.920 --> 03:13:21.560
[Amit Varma]: my next question is this that as things happen the more they happen the more they they get

03:13:21.560 --> 03:13:27.320
[Amit Varma]: normalized the more there is a sense of numbing and i would imagine that uh you know if i had

03:13:27.320 --> 03:13:32.360
[Amit Varma]: to cover incident of communal violence after violence after violence eventually you know

03:13:32.360 --> 03:13:39.400
[Amit Varma]: it could bleed into one but what you have done in your writing and in fact you know just your

03:13:39.400 --> 03:13:46.040
[Amit Varma]: description of one of the deaths at cheetah camp is an example of that is that you took that deeper

03:13:46.040 --> 03:13:51.720
[Amit Varma]: look and humanize a person like you could easily say that uh you know a muslim boy was in a room

03:13:51.720 --> 03:13:57.400
[Amit Varma]: and the police burst in and they took him out and they killed him but instead we know that he's a

03:13:57.400 --> 03:14:02.200
[Amit Varma]: zari worker his name is abdullah he's writing a letter to a friend in kuwait about the birth of

03:14:02.200 --> 03:14:07.880
[Amit Varma]: his child and then the police burst in and take him out and this just humanizes the whole thing

03:14:07.880 --> 03:14:12.680
[Amit Varma]: immediately there is empathy and it's in fact really cinematic like if you had a web series

03:14:12.680 --> 03:14:18.360
[Amit Varma]: on communal violence your opening scene could just be the letter being read out and whatever

03:14:18.360 --> 03:14:22.040
[Amit Varma]: and then that sudden burst and the shock of the police and the violence and all of that

03:14:23.160 --> 03:14:30.440
[Amit Varma]: this gaze did you work at developing it was it partly um a sort of a strategic thing that for

03:14:30.440 --> 03:14:35.320
[Amit Varma]: my stories to be powerful this is what i have to do is it something that was taught to you

03:14:35.320 --> 03:14:40.200
[Amit Varma]: or that you learned over time by yourself or was it always just natural to you tell me a little

03:14:40.200 --> 03:14:45.080
[Amit Varma]: bit about the craft of doing this kind of reporting to make it affect i don't think anything is just

03:14:45.080 --> 03:14:52.040
[Guest]: entirely natural or is entirely taught right it's both correct so but if you're serious about what

03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:57.800
[Guest]: you're doing and i think i was extremely serious and honest about reporting on communal violence

03:14:57.800 --> 03:15:03.480
[Guest]: very honest i was always interrogating myself how do i put it down how do i communicate this

03:15:03.480 --> 03:15:08.200
[Guest]: because you know you are writing on something which is potentially uh you're going to reach

03:15:08.200 --> 03:15:13.240
[Guest]: people you enjoy a certain credibility then you it's all the more reason why you should be doing

03:15:13.240 --> 03:15:20.280
[Guest]: it extremely carefully before i try and answer it further i want to give you one more example

03:15:21.400 --> 03:15:28.840
[Guest]: of something like this in 1991 i was covering the rath yatra that rath yatra and uh that takes

03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:35.400
[Guest]: place in jamalpur every year ahemdabad i was in business india and i was lucky in business india

03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:40.280
[Guest]: allowed that space to explore the issue a little bit so it was not just like newspaper coverage

03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:47.400
[Guest]: where you were covering on a day-to-day basis so it was a particularly uh uh brutal brutalizing

03:15:47.400 --> 03:15:54.280
[Guest]: period that was happening all along because uh uh you had seen that whole development post 1986

03:15:54.280 --> 03:16:01.800
[Guest]: and then of course it culminated in 2002 like i've written about but 1991 i actually traveled

03:16:01.800 --> 03:16:07.560
[Guest]: by train from bombay to baroda surat then surat to baroda surat then finally ended up in himmat

03:16:07.560 --> 03:16:12.520
[Guest]: nagar ahemdabad and i kept talking to people including businessmen who happened to be hindu

03:16:12.520 --> 03:16:19.320
[Guest]: and one just was really appalled by the level of crass hate that was being openly spoken about

03:16:19.320 --> 03:16:24.680
[Guest]: about the muslim minority but that apart that also reflected in my business story but

03:16:25.560 --> 03:16:31.000
[Guest]: uh this particular incident i remember being really very very horrified by which is that

03:16:32.360 --> 03:16:39.160
[Guest]: narangpura the posh area of ahemdabad uh one of the narratives of the vishwa hindu parishad at

03:16:39.160 --> 03:16:44.360
[Guest]: that time was to distribute to journalists this map of ahemdabad which was painted

03:16:44.360 --> 03:16:49.800
[Guest]: uh orange and green and i'm looking everywhere my people come a hoarder when i'm a real archivist

03:16:49.800 --> 03:16:56.920
[Guest]: but i can't find it to show that you know anytime a muslim couple or a mixed marriage couple try to

03:16:56.920 --> 03:17:01.800
[Guest]: move to a quote-unquote more elite area which by their definition was a hindu area

03:17:02.600 --> 03:17:07.320
[Guest]: they would ensure through violence to push them back and there were many such incidents

03:17:07.320 --> 03:17:14.360
[Guest]: one such was really brutal because this particular gentleman khan was his surname

03:17:14.920 --> 03:17:19.480
[Guest]: living in this building second floor of a building in narangpura obviously had moved out from the

03:17:19.480 --> 03:17:25.800
[Guest]: old city and in the height of the rathiata violence this couple of baksum gujrati

03:17:26.760 --> 03:17:32.280
[Guest]: sari-clad women had pushed him to his death from the second floor back it was something that chilled

03:17:32.280 --> 03:17:39.720
[Guest]: me because it was like so many things in that incident because it it was and how do you and how

03:17:39.720 --> 03:17:45.720
[Guest]: do you ensure that a community remains ghettoized and the brutality of the violence the fact that

03:17:45.720 --> 03:17:50.920
[Guest]: women are now engaging in communal violence as much as men which was not something i saw till 86

03:17:50.920 --> 03:17:58.120
[Guest]: 87 in the country at all so you saw the handiwork of the vishwa hindu parishad and the sadhvi

03:17:58.120 --> 03:18:03.880
[Guest]: then the sadhvi ritambaras as as icons you know it's working it's working in society so it was

03:18:03.880 --> 03:18:10.760
[Guest]: horrific at so many levels so anyway i was in the process of writing this book so i was speaking in

03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:15.960
[Guest]: nagpur and this is i think just a few months before the book came out in 2016 and there's a

03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:20.120
[Guest]: public meeting in nagpur where i narrated this incident and i write about this also in the book

03:18:21.160 --> 03:18:26.520
[Guest]: and after the meeting is over on the stage and all if you remember i see this young man sitting

03:18:26.520 --> 03:18:31.400
[Guest]: there and he's shaken really shaken right and he said ma'am can i have a word with you and all i

03:18:31.400 --> 03:18:37.240
[Guest]: said sure and he's he's a reporter for the times of india won't mention his name and he said i just

03:18:37.240 --> 03:18:44.200
[Guest]: want to finish your story you mentioned that incident and i was just 12 or 13 or 14 when it

03:18:44.200 --> 03:18:49.320
[Guest]: took place and it had chilled me and my family and i don't think you know this because you've

03:18:49.320 --> 03:18:54.440
[Guest]: reported gujarat so closely i'm telling you so you can round off the story that that navratri

03:18:54.440 --> 03:19:02.760
[Guest]: three months later those women were felicitated so you know you realize when you're writing coming

03:19:02.760 --> 03:19:07.480
[Guest]: back to your earlier question that how do you write these stories that you have to write about

03:19:07.480 --> 03:19:13.640
[Guest]: every nuance and every tone if you're honest about the story you have to also write the fact

03:19:13.640 --> 03:19:20.040
[Guest]: that when you reach godhra the first time i reached godhra godhra was on 21st 22nd of

03:19:20.040 --> 03:19:28.840
[Guest]: 21st 22nd of no no that was on 9th of march 21st 22nd was justice with justice varma

03:19:31.480 --> 03:19:35.560
[Guest]: that visit was preceded by so many rumors as to why godhra had taken place

03:19:36.360 --> 03:19:41.960
[Guest]: and you have to actually unravel those rumors so the rumor was one rumor for the majority

03:19:41.960 --> 03:19:46.600
[Guest]: community one rumor for the minority community all of that because you know by then you had tv

03:19:46.600 --> 03:19:51.400
[Guest]: internet emails had begun and all of that and one particular story i remember was about this

03:19:52.520 --> 03:20:00.600
[Guest]: muslim girl at the godhra platform who was eve-teased by the karsevaks okay so that incident

03:20:00.600 --> 03:20:05.080
[Guest]: happened it was bakrid that she was returned bakrid i was few days back so she was returning

03:20:05.080 --> 03:20:11.000
[Guest]: to baroda with her mother and her younger sister and she was in attractive teenager and she was

03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:15.080
[Guest]: actually eve-teased but what did the rumor among the muslim community say that she was pulled inside

03:20:15.080 --> 03:20:21.160
[Guest]: one of the compartments and something so you know the story becomes another story you know so one

03:20:21.160 --> 03:20:26.760
[Guest]: of the things i keep saying in my lectures to journalists and suggestions is never report

03:20:26.760 --> 03:20:32.680
[Guest]: incidents of communal violence unless you have verified every incident even of the survivor or

03:20:32.680 --> 03:20:38.600
[Guest]: the victim because because there is a tendency to of the of the untruth to also spiral into truth

03:20:38.600 --> 03:20:43.000
[Guest]: you know because that's how the rumor functions and rumor is something you have to really guard

03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:50.760
[Guest]: against as a journalist so long winded answer but to say that be honest be truthful cover every nuance

03:20:51.320 --> 03:20:55.320
[Guest]: but never forget that the human victim needs to be central to the story

03:20:57.560 --> 03:21:01.720
[Guest]: victim or survivor because you're not writing about numbers you're not writing about

03:21:01.720 --> 03:21:06.040
[Guest]: numbers of death but you're writing about a human being a set of human beings who've lost their

03:21:06.040 --> 03:21:12.200
[Guest]: dignity and life it is something you learn i don't think anything is just pure instinct or natural

03:21:12.200 --> 03:21:17.000
[Guest]: but it's something i learned because i was serious about continuing to cover it though

03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:20.920
[Guest]: it was a deep personal cost because it takes something out of you every time

03:21:24.520 --> 03:21:32.600
[Amit Varma]: tell me about how that sort of journey happened from where you realized that activism was a part

03:21:32.600 --> 03:21:37.000
[Amit Varma]: of your journalism just because of the nature of the stories you were doing and so on and so forth

03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:49.960
[Guest]: where does the pen stop the full stop or does it stop with some little bit of justice being done

03:21:49.960 --> 03:21:56.200
[Guest]: to the survivor should one facilitate that at all or should one just stop with the full stop and the

03:21:56.200 --> 03:22:02.920
[Guest]: typewriter and walk off from there so there's another story if you'll allow me which is that

03:22:02.920 --> 03:22:11.080
[Guest]: uh this is again 92 93 which is 7th i think is 7th 8th of december demolition was sunday 6

03:22:11.720 --> 03:22:19.720
[Guest]: and i reached this khan abdul khan gaffar khan nagar and kurla and i reach around 9 10 in the

03:22:19.720 --> 03:22:27.800
[Guest]: morning and this is one particular lane where there is this sole or lone muslim building

03:22:27.800 --> 03:22:35.240
[Guest]: otherwise it's a maharashtrian locality and it's the survivors of muslim survivors of the

03:22:35.240 --> 03:22:40.200
[Guest]: building who tell me the story so i don't think you can get it truer than that they tell me two

03:22:40.200 --> 03:22:46.120
[Guest]: three things they also praise the acp of the locality for dispelling a rumor a real rumor

03:22:46.120 --> 03:22:51.000
[Guest]: not a rumor fact when there was a pig was you know typical that you know what i can't also get

03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:56.440
[Guest]: to is that i remember watching tamas i don't know if you watch tamas at all but reading tamas

03:22:56.440 --> 03:23:02.760
[Guest]: watching tamas and then reading partition related sharath chandra stories and the cow carcass and

03:23:02.760 --> 03:23:09.240
[Guest]: the pig carcass and the sindoor outside the mosque and the music outside the the stuff doesn't change

03:23:09.960 --> 03:23:15.080
[Guest]: and yet we are falling prey and victim to this every time so i don't know how we are going to

03:23:15.080 --> 03:23:19.320
[Guest]: ever deal with this and stop it does it mean people's education people's awareness or whatever

03:23:19.880 --> 03:23:24.600
[Guest]: that's an aside so i reach there and this family starts telling me the story that we would not

03:23:24.600 --> 03:23:29.800
[Guest]: have been alive today but for this one woman i said who's this one woman so she says she's about

03:23:29.800 --> 03:23:36.840
[Guest]: 70 75 years old at the time she's the mother of the shiv sena shakha pramukh now you know it's it's

03:23:36.840 --> 03:23:42.840
[Guest]: it's like unbelievable story material because she is this now nowari saree wearing maharashtrian

03:23:42.840 --> 03:23:49.400
[Guest]: woman i go and meet her i take her photograph on my black and white camera and what has she done

03:23:49.400 --> 03:23:54.920
[Guest]: her son bharat kavnekar drunk has taken this mob the night before 12 one o'clock

03:23:55.800 --> 03:23:59.880
[Guest]: and is exhorting the mob to burn down the building attack and burn down the building

03:24:00.440 --> 03:24:06.200
[Guest]: she gets to know she goes there this is all being told to me by the muslims who survived all this

03:24:07.240 --> 03:24:13.880
[Guest]: she stands in front of them and here's her son who's like drunk and here's his mother

03:24:13.880 --> 03:24:19.000
[Guest]: and here's his mother and she's saying that you will go there over my dead body

03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:22.200
[Guest]: you got your talwar in your hand first you attack me and then you go

03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:28.040
[Guest]: and then this face-off continues for a few minutes and then obviously slinks away ashamed

03:24:29.640 --> 03:24:35.480
[Guest]: now i've got the story i did the story i talked to her because of these survivors i get the story

03:24:35.480 --> 03:24:39.640
[Guest]: from them then i go and talk to her i take her photograph and i'm in business india which is a

03:24:39.640 --> 03:24:46.360
[Guest]: fortnightly and i said this is not on i mean i can't i mean this story has to be told now when

03:24:46.360 --> 03:24:53.240
[Guest]: the city is burning so it so happened that my husband is in sandhubs over so he's i said can

03:24:53.240 --> 03:24:58.440
[Guest]: i go and meet your editor i talked to his editor and they put the story there with with a little

03:24:59.480 --> 03:25:04.680
[Guest]: caption and nice small little text story but the photo is the most important and then she

03:25:04.680 --> 03:25:09.240
[Guest]: gets the mayor's medal for bravery now should i have stopped at not doing that because i mean

03:25:09.240 --> 03:25:15.560
[Guest]: for me that is important both as a journalist and as a citizen that this act of hers gets

03:25:15.560 --> 03:25:22.520
[Guest]: recognized and important she becomes a symbol in those in those hatred in times so that's

03:25:22.520 --> 03:25:29.800
[Guest]: these kind of things that started happening then 92 93 sainath nikhil wagle saajid rasheed javed

03:25:29.800 --> 03:25:37.720
[Guest]: me our homes were like mini control rooms naresh fernandez daryl de monte because we were not just

03:25:37.720 --> 03:25:43.160
[Guest]: covering riots there was no way we could be every part of bombay so we were also sharing credible

03:25:43.160 --> 03:25:48.120
[Guest]: information so that we could report on other areas where we couldn't be but we were also

03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:53.800
[Guest]: responding to despairing calls of victims now could we should we just put down the calls and

03:25:53.800 --> 03:25:58.600
[Guest]: not call the cops after that those are the dilemmas we faced real life dilemmas that all of

03:25:58.600 --> 03:26:05.480
[Guest]: us faced and all of us were doing this reporting also writing also and also making those calls

03:26:05.480 --> 03:26:10.440
[Guest]: and that's when you found out that police is not responsive police is giving bizarre answers to the

03:26:11.080 --> 03:26:15.720
[Guest]: victims so you know it was an evolution and presenting a need of the times that one needed

03:26:15.720 --> 03:26:23.800
[Guest]: to do more than just put pen to paper or type out your story and give it in and part of the journalism

03:26:24.440 --> 03:26:29.560
[Amit Varma]: is reporting in the moment that okay this happened this this lady in a sari went and

03:26:29.560 --> 03:26:35.800
[Amit Varma]: stood in front of her son and you know that's a story but one of the things that you pointed out

03:26:35.800 --> 03:26:41.800
[Amit Varma]: that made you feel that you need to do more that you can't work within traditional media anymore

03:26:41.800 --> 03:26:50.840
[Amit Varma]: is that traditional media was too focused on events but what built up to it what led to it

03:26:50.840 --> 03:26:55.480
[Amit Varma]: what is going on in the background in a sense the scene in the unseen right that there is so much

03:26:55.480 --> 03:27:00.680
[Amit Varma]: that is happening unseen and those layers are not being peeled off by journalists because those

03:27:00.680 --> 03:27:07.320
[Amit Varma]: layers aren't sensational and you wanted to sort of then dig a little deeper into those layers so

03:27:07.320 --> 03:27:13.880
[Amit Varma]: tell me about how you started coming to the sense that journalism is not it anymore and you need to

03:27:13.880 --> 03:27:19.400
[Amit Varma]: go beyond and a supplementary question to that is that did the teaching that you were doing

03:27:19.400 --> 03:27:25.000
[Amit Varma]: did it help you understand the subject better because if you're teaching it then you're thinking

03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:31.560
[Amit Varma]: about it deeper you're going more into you know fundamental causes and so on and so forth so did

03:27:31.560 --> 03:27:37.960
[Guest]: that help i just started teaching it later around around about maybe the early 2000s or late not

03:27:37.960 --> 03:27:43.720
[Guest]: immediately after so sure that happened after much more experience came in dealing with it but uh

03:27:43.720 --> 03:27:55.480
[Guest]: but uh but certainly before 2002 uh so the um but i think uh uh you know the the how do you put it

03:27:55.480 --> 03:28:03.000
[Guest]: that uh i think we were also lucky enough to be part of a generation of journalists and writers or

03:28:04.360 --> 03:28:12.040
[Guest]: that were by training in nature compelled to reflect on your own work okay you didn't just

03:28:12.040 --> 03:28:15.800
[Guest]: do it and forget about it you looked at it you looked at your peers you looked at your

03:28:15.800 --> 03:28:19.240
[Guest]: mentors and you know you talked about it that is it something you could have done better

03:28:19.880 --> 03:28:23.160
[Guest]: is it some more elements you could have added so that was always a part of us

03:28:23.880 --> 03:28:32.920
[Guest]: then as it you know then as 1984 moved to 92 93 and then like you yourself mentioned uh apart

03:28:32.920 --> 03:28:37.880
[Guest]: from who cast the first stone this whole business of hate speech and hate writing then this business

03:28:37.880 --> 03:28:43.320
[Guest]: about fallout build up and fallout that how long do you stay with the story that oh yeah

03:28:46.360 --> 03:28:52.600
[Guest]: but you realize that under the law for seven years a missing person cannot get a check

03:28:53.240 --> 03:28:59.160
[Guest]: so if your body of the body of the dead person has not been found and that that was is true of

03:28:59.160 --> 03:29:03.640
[Guest]: targeted violence always that they're charred to nothingness you can't recognize them or the

03:29:03.640 --> 03:29:08.040
[Guest]: body is not well then you can't claim the compensation or reparation for seven years

03:29:08.040 --> 03:29:12.360
[Guest]: so this is the loss i mean then then you want to battle that for them you want to at least write

03:29:12.360 --> 03:29:16.600
[Guest]: about it for them but then your publication starts telling you that you know now it's

03:29:16.600 --> 03:29:25.000
[Guest]: an old story so you know many of these things started happening uh after gujar after 92 93

03:29:27.560 --> 03:29:32.120
[Guest]: i mean it's not ironic 84 then 92 and then 2002 you know i mean and i've said that you know if

03:29:32.120 --> 03:29:37.720
[Guest]: this culture of impunity an 83 nelly if this culture of all pervasive impunity which cuts

03:29:37.720 --> 03:29:41.960
[Guest]: across parties where the binding factors of bureaucracy and the police that is there to

03:29:41.960 --> 03:29:47.800
[Guest]: protect each other so that nobody gets booked did not exist and you would not have one massacre

03:29:47.800 --> 03:29:53.080
[Guest]: leading to a worse massacre later you know it is that culture of impunity that was trying to

03:29:53.080 --> 03:30:02.200
[Guest]: understand and grapple with so it's it's i think uh it was it was a challenge and that is what it

03:30:02.200 --> 03:30:09.640
[Guest]: was a challenge to try and figure this out but how to write it and report it in a in a fair honest

03:30:09.640 --> 03:30:17.240
[Guest]: emotive uh proper way and also to be able to not stop at just reporting it tell me a little bit

03:30:17.240 --> 03:30:23.640
[Amit Varma]: about you know that phrase you mentioned who casts the first stone because what we are currently

03:30:23.640 --> 03:30:29.720
[Amit Varma]: sort of seeing all around us is basically narrative battles you know and and a of course

03:30:29.720 --> 03:30:35.720
[Amit Varma]: that raises the question of uh you know where does journalism fit into this you're just one

03:30:35.720 --> 03:30:41.160
[Amit Varma]: more narrative in a sea of narratives and you know but that can just lead us to uh unproductive

03:30:41.160 --> 03:30:50.280
[Amit Varma]: laments but you've pointed out the skill with which all of this is uh done both in 92 93 where

03:30:50.280 --> 03:30:54.440
[Amit Varma]: somehow these guys spread the bizarre narrative that the riots were a response to the blast you

03:30:54.440 --> 03:31:00.200
[Amit Varma]: know well it was the other way around you know the blast happened in march 93 and there was more

03:31:00.200 --> 03:31:04.760
[Guest]: that they were before that they said before they came to that bizarre proposition and remember

03:31:04.760 --> 03:31:10.280
[Guest]: prakash javadekar was the lead one in that was that radha bhai chawl set it all off which was

03:31:10.280 --> 03:31:15.560
[Guest]: radha bhai chawl incident was 4th and 5th january whereas you had all of december the city burning

03:31:15.560 --> 03:31:20.040
[Guest]: and you had several things spiraling into everything including one muslim family burnt

03:31:20.040 --> 03:31:26.680
[Guest]: alive in an red maruti car and top hill two days before radha bhai chawl if at all you need to

03:31:26.680 --> 03:31:30.680
[Guest]: count this because i think beyond a point it doesn't matter which was first it was just a

03:31:30.680 --> 03:31:35.720
[Guest]: phenomenon but you just want to turn every narrative on his end and it was a marty's

03:31:35.720 --> 03:31:42.120
[Guest]: that were begun on 22nd december which were the single defining uh factor responsible for the

03:31:42.120 --> 03:31:48.760
[Guest]: targeted violence of january you know so so many levels and of course these leaders crisscrossing

03:31:48.760 --> 03:31:54.840
[Guest]: the country it was advani whether it was sadhvi ritambhara spewing venom of course you didn't

03:31:54.840 --> 03:32:00.440
[Guest]: have social media but you had their video cassettes being distributed and it was so so so damaging

03:32:00.440 --> 03:32:06.920
[Amit Varma]: would it have been worse if there was social media needless to say like before we talk about

03:32:06.920 --> 03:32:12.840
[Amit Varma]: communalism combat tell me a little bit about javed so you know like you you guys were colleagues and

03:32:12.840 --> 03:32:16.920
[Amit Varma]: you were covering sort of communal riots both of you he was in bhiwandi and you were in jugeshwari

03:32:16.920 --> 03:32:25.240
[Guest]: and uh govandi in 84 so tell me a little bit about the partnership actually he is a graduate of iit

03:32:25.240 --> 03:32:30.600
[Guest]: mumbai uh kind of metallurgy engineer who never did a day's engineering in his life he went straight

03:32:30.600 --> 03:32:36.120
[Guest]: after graduate coming out of iit he was a gold medalist and all he went straight to working in

03:32:36.120 --> 03:32:41.400
[Guest]: rural maharashtra joined an organization called freya and then isre so engaged with kind of

03:32:41.400 --> 03:32:51.560
[Guest]: alternate development working in marathwada the 71 drought and uh uh you know then a library

03:32:51.560 --> 03:32:56.680
[Guest]: movement in the state and all of that he entered journalism through a very unusual trajectory

03:32:57.480 --> 03:33:01.720
[Guest]: which was not planned like like i wanted to become a journalist is through the textile

03:33:02.520 --> 03:33:09.400
[Guest]: strike so he had started as a labor activist looking very closely at the whole reason of

03:33:09.400 --> 03:33:15.960
[Guest]: labor unions and all that and started reporting on the textile strike for the blitz and the daily

03:33:15.960 --> 03:33:20.440
[Guest]: and those reports had done very well and they were very very highly read and all that which is when

03:33:20.440 --> 03:33:24.920
[Guest]: russi karanji offered him a job of special correspondent in the daily so that's when his

03:33:24.920 --> 03:33:29.720
[Guest]: he sort of transitioned that was a couple of years before me so i joined in 83 and that's where we met

03:33:30.440 --> 03:33:34.840
[Guest]: and uh we got to know each other almost immediately in 84 we covered the communal

03:33:34.840 --> 03:33:41.560
[Guest]: violence together so i think it was a uh obviously it was a camaraderie and all that

03:33:41.560 --> 03:33:50.040
[Guest]: also respect for the profession but also i think apart from a kind of perspective on labor and

03:33:50.040 --> 03:33:56.600
[Guest]: human rights and generally i think this whole huge concern for the targeted and communal violence

03:33:56.600 --> 03:34:04.840
[Guest]: was a was also was a shared kind of shared concern and i remember long conversations with javid

03:34:04.840 --> 03:34:09.400
[Guest]: when he would come back from bivandi i would come back from covering bombay and you just needed to

03:34:09.400 --> 03:34:13.560
[Guest]: talk it out because it was so brutal you couldn't sort of rest that night before you had long

03:34:13.560 --> 03:34:19.480
[Guest]: conversations and sorted it out or nothing gets sorted but at least you share it and that was a

03:34:19.480 --> 03:34:25.640
[Guest]: huge binding time very difficult painful time but a binding time and then i decided to quit the daily

03:34:26.360 --> 03:34:30.840
[Guest]: within a year and few months because he got promoted to chief reporter and i just

03:34:31.480 --> 03:34:36.200
[Guest]: did not want to ever have the uh anybody because he got personally involved also i didn't want

03:34:36.200 --> 03:34:39.960
[Guest]: anybody to ever kind of and people will you know that's saying that i would get any

03:34:40.840 --> 03:34:45.080
[Guest]: and i was very clear and that i was a decent journalist i didn't want to get that thing about

03:34:45.080 --> 03:34:49.880
[Guest]: my having any favors because he was chief reporter so i had also begun doing a lot of legal reporting

03:34:49.880 --> 03:34:54.680
[Guest]: and i was covering the antulay trial so by then i got an offer from express so i shifted the moment

03:34:54.680 --> 03:35:03.240
[Guest]: i got it so it was i think a shared concern about where the country was going in terms of targeted

03:35:03.240 --> 03:35:08.760
[Guest]: violence and what i found was a huge complementarity was that of course i was hugely concerned about

03:35:08.760 --> 03:35:15.560
[Guest]: majoritarianism and the you know impending doom of hindutva which i saw but i realized that he

03:35:15.560 --> 03:35:20.600
[Guest]: had this capacity i think because of his own biography because he grew up as a believing

03:35:20.600 --> 03:35:27.080
[Guest]: muslim came to iit and iit sort of radicalized him completely so he became left and all of that

03:35:27.800 --> 03:35:32.040
[Guest]: but i remember him telling me that when he was younger he was not only would recite the quran

03:35:32.040 --> 03:35:37.560
[Guest]: but didn't want his mom to abandon the burqa and i can't imagine that to be the javed i know so

03:35:37.560 --> 03:35:43.960
[Guest]: there was a huge change so he would always be talking about the absence of rationalism within

03:35:43.960 --> 03:35:49.320
[Guest]: the muslim community and i would always need it needs to be talked about as much as majoritarian

03:35:49.320 --> 03:35:52.920
[Guest]: need to talk and i thought that was a very interesting dialectic because i was of course

03:35:52.920 --> 03:35:58.760
[Guest]: very concerned with the majoritarians of the community i was born into but he was always very

03:35:58.760 --> 03:36:06.200
[Guest]: interrogative of the regress in which he saw and the obduracy so among the leadership even over

03:36:06.200 --> 03:36:12.040
[Guest]: babri masjid of course everybody was extremely upset by the demolition but he he wrote this

03:36:12.040 --> 03:36:16.280
[Guest]: piece i remember which i thought was a pretty pretty brave piece he wrote i think in sunday

03:36:16.280 --> 03:36:24.360
[Guest]: observer which even siyasat carried translating it in urdu where he he was writing to the likes

03:36:24.360 --> 03:36:29.400
[Guest]: of shahabuddin that don't make this into hindu muslim battle make it a battle of the battle

03:36:29.400 --> 03:36:34.520
[Guest]: between the constitution and non-constitution and leave it to the majority to fight that battle

03:36:34.520 --> 03:36:38.520
[Guest]: because if you make it into hindu muslim battle you're not winning given the trajectory of pakistan

03:36:38.520 --> 03:36:43.720
[Guest]: and i remember not getting up slightly while writing that but realizing the sense of it

03:36:44.280 --> 03:36:49.240
[Guest]: because you saw extremely hysterical outpourings coming from the minority side which was matched

03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:55.560
[Guest]: then by the aggression from the majority side and the sufferer is always going to be the minority

03:36:55.560 --> 03:37:00.200
[Guest]: in in this situation and he was able to see that dialectic you know which which is a huge learning

03:37:00.200 --> 03:37:04.600
[Guest]: experience and continues to be because even he wrote this recent piece in the express on the

03:37:04.600 --> 03:37:09.720
[Guest]: hijab thing and i don't agree with it entirely because i think the education of a muslim girl

03:37:09.720 --> 03:37:15.160
[Guest]: is for me paramount even if she is forced by a pfi kind of outfit to wear the hijab but

03:37:15.160 --> 03:37:20.520
[Guest]: i i realize the importance of a javed and writing what he's saying is that that you know outfits

03:37:20.520 --> 03:37:25.320
[Guest]: like pfi cannot be given currency because they are just the flip side of the rss and they're

03:37:25.320 --> 03:37:30.360
[Guest]: a whole he says for instance that a whole generation of extremely intelligent muslims

03:37:30.360 --> 03:37:35.240
[Guest]: were lost to simi and now we are losing them to pfi you know and it's very sad that there's not a

03:37:35.240 --> 03:37:39.560
[Guest]: another kind of politics that young muslims are going into so there's there's there's that

03:37:39.560 --> 03:37:45.400
[Guest]: there's that engagement as a partnership which i think is always plot a complementarity to it

03:37:45.400 --> 03:37:50.600
[Guest]: we've also had very strong arguments but i think it adds a lot to your own perspective also

03:37:50.600 --> 03:37:55.880
[Guest]: so the so like he always says it's very important that this work is risky or she does the work she

03:37:55.880 --> 03:38:01.480
[Guest]: does but it's very important that i continue to do this kind of interrogation so i think and

03:38:02.360 --> 03:38:08.920
[Guest]: nature wise is much calmer than i am maybe but it's it's been a great partnership you know i've

03:38:08.920 --> 03:38:13.800
[Amit Varma]: been reading some pieces by him while looking your work up and i found his writing really nuanced

03:38:13.800 --> 03:38:19.320
[Amit Varma]: and even this piece that you mentioned on the bhabri and i was just thinking that in today's

03:38:19.320 --> 03:38:24.920
[Amit Varma]: sort of social media polarized environment uh you know this is just going to get you slapped

03:38:24.920 --> 03:38:32.680
[Amit Varma]: from both sides that do you feel that there is a degeneration of the discourse in the sense that

03:38:32.680 --> 03:38:38.520
[Amit Varma]: there is sort of this incentive to preach to the choir and to kind of go more and more extreme on

03:38:38.520 --> 03:38:43.240
[Amit Varma]: either side yeah and therefore there is no space in the middle there is no space for nuance you

03:38:43.240 --> 03:38:48.440
[Amit Varma]: really have to be careful otherwise you're going to get mobbed from every end not only that there

03:38:48.440 --> 03:38:54.520
[Guest]: is no respect for the need for dialogue are we going to stop talking to each other yeah i mean

03:38:54.520 --> 03:38:59.800
[Guest]: am i going to believe that every single hindu or muslim even if he or she is different from what i

03:38:59.800 --> 03:39:05.160
[Guest]: stand for that we can't have a conversation come to some meeting around and i think that is very

03:39:05.160 --> 03:39:10.920
[Guest]: dangerous in this extreme polarized and i think that's what the ultra right wants they want the

03:39:10.920 --> 03:39:18.040
[Guest]: reasonable voice to be completely submerged and to some extent they are succeeding but that's

03:39:18.040 --> 03:39:23.000
[Guest]: that's the space we have to battle for we really have to battle hard for and i keep telling people

03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:27.400
[Guest]: that listen i don't want to fight an election so i'm going to say this i'm going to say both

03:39:27.400 --> 03:39:32.360
[Guest]: things and i don't want to come to fight an election i'm not coming for popular popular

03:39:33.160 --> 03:39:37.160
[Guest]: brownie points so you may like what i'm saying you may not like what i'm saying

03:39:37.160 --> 03:39:44.200
[Amit Varma]: but even the tough things need to be said so i'll pose to you a question i asked both hussein

03:39:44.200 --> 03:39:50.280
[Amit Varma]: haidri and gazala wahab when they were on my show which is something i'm truly befuddled by which is

03:39:50.280 --> 03:39:57.000
[Amit Varma]: that clearly what would work for the hindu right is that you provoke provoke provoke prod prod

03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:02.680
[Amit Varma]: prod and some poor muslim guy somewhere can't take it anymore and lashes out and then you

03:40:02.680 --> 03:40:07.880
[Amit Varma]: use the lashing out you spread it all over whatsapp and you use it as a pretext for whatever

03:40:07.880 --> 03:40:13.400
[Amit Varma]: the same way gudra was a pretext for what happened and that scares the shit out of me because it

03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:18.360
[Amit Varma]: almost seems inevitable because there is no end to provocations especially this year it seems like

03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:23.400
[Amit Varma]: almost every week there are three or four things that we hear of in the news which are just

03:40:24.360 --> 03:40:30.360
[Amit Varma]: you know it's targeted anti-muslim hatred and you just need one guy somewhere to snap and do

03:40:30.360 --> 03:40:36.840
[Amit Varma]: something and yet uh you know the muslims of india and one shouldn't generalize but by and large

03:40:36.840 --> 03:40:41.560
[Guest]: aren't snapping there's really i mean they have to live through the violence and hatred let's

03:40:41.560 --> 03:40:47.080
[Guest]: remember that and they have already lived through it for decades the worst of course being uh post

03:40:47.080 --> 03:40:53.960
[Guest]: 2014 to some extent but 2002 and then partition and all of that so 92 93 bombay so i mean it's

03:40:53.960 --> 03:40:57.800
[Guest]: the community that is at the receiving end that realizes how it has to live and how it has to

03:40:57.800 --> 03:41:02.520
[Guest]: navigate and i don't think we can ever have the gumption to speak for them i think it's really

03:41:02.520 --> 03:41:07.880
[Guest]: wrong to do that but i've always said this that you know and this what i've said even to

03:41:07.880 --> 03:41:12.920
[Guest]: law enforcement personnel police officers in better times when one would be called to

03:41:13.480 --> 03:41:18.360
[Guest]: meetings with the uh at sardar patel police academy i would be called for lectures at one

03:41:18.360 --> 03:41:22.680
[Guest]: point which of course won't happen now at least under this regime and i used to say that do you

03:41:22.680 --> 03:41:29.480
[Guest]: realize that 99.9 percent of muslims today are still not getting provoked at all and that's a

03:41:29.480 --> 03:41:35.000
[Guest]: huge huge uh tick mark you know and therefore it's so important i'm not saying there's no

03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:40.040
[Guest]: radicalization happening i'm not saying there's no but that's a huge thing in favor of law and

03:41:40.040 --> 03:41:45.320
[Guest]: for forget these are silver and civil rights activists it's a very important reality and

03:41:45.320 --> 03:41:50.920
[Guest]: therefore what you need to do is trust building what you need to do is rights and a politics of

03:41:50.920 --> 03:41:55.320
[Guest]: rights and not a political patronage and i think this is what the glimmer of hope that the ca anti

03:41:55.320 --> 03:42:02.440
[Guest]: ca anti nrc movement gave us all particularly the initial phases when you saw the emergence of and

03:42:02.440 --> 03:42:06.040
[Guest]: i think before lots of other people jumped in i don't want to get into that but when you saw

03:42:06.040 --> 03:42:12.600
[Guest]: actually it became a articulation by amazingly articulate community women and youngsters

03:42:13.400 --> 03:42:18.280
[Guest]: who was who was taking their voice as citizens you know that we are not going to get

03:42:18.840 --> 03:42:25.160
[Guest]: dishoused from here we've bloody opted to stay here and we are indians and of course unfortunately

03:42:25.160 --> 03:42:29.880
[Guest]: that whole narrative got turned around completely and brutalized with the covid and incarceration

03:42:29.880 --> 03:42:34.520
[Guest]: and all of that i don't think that can entirely disappear though that spirit can't go of course

03:42:34.520 --> 03:42:38.840
[Guest]: the cost has been hugely high paid by the community but i think it'll come back it'll

03:42:38.840 --> 03:42:44.440
[Guest]: resurrect itself at some point uh and i think that the farmer's movement also got a lot of heart from

03:42:44.440 --> 03:42:48.120
[Guest]: shinebug i don't think these things happen in isolation you know so i think the farmer's

03:42:48.120 --> 03:42:53.640
[Guest]: movement coming up and it was also very syncretic and the fact that it did also articulate some of

03:42:53.640 --> 03:43:00.520
[Guest]: the political issues that had preceded what had happened and all that but i think it's really not

03:43:00.520 --> 03:43:05.320
[Guest]: a good space to be in what the indian muslim community is today being pushed into it's it's

03:43:06.040 --> 03:43:12.280
[Guest]: it's it's very very sad it's disgusting as far as i'm concerned as a thinking indian that any

03:43:12.280 --> 03:43:16.680
[Guest]: individual or community has to be compelled to live like that and pretend that everything is

03:43:16.680 --> 03:43:21.720
[Guest]: all right i think that's the worst thing ever you know because things are not okay i mean you just

03:43:21.720 --> 03:43:25.960
[Guest]: have to have a child going to school or you know you have to have somebody traveling by public

03:43:25.960 --> 03:43:31.080
[Guest]: transport or you have to or you need to sit and listen to conversations on how with what fear

03:43:31.080 --> 03:43:36.920
[Guest]: people travel by train or a cross-country train or whatever it is fearing that you know if they

03:43:36.920 --> 03:43:41.320
[Guest]: just open their tiffin box they might be lynched you know so i think it's a terrible terrible

03:43:41.960 --> 03:43:47.080
[Guest]: situation to live through we i mean i think the more of us who are born into the privileged

03:43:47.080 --> 03:43:52.680
[Guest]: majority should not just acknowledge it but do little and big things to to to to

03:43:53.960 --> 03:43:57.480
[Guest]: put this in our veins and to stop it and to protest it wherever we can

03:43:59.160 --> 03:44:06.920
[Amit Varma]: tell me about criminalism combat now because you know you started in 93 and what was your sense of

03:44:06.920 --> 03:44:13.080
[Amit Varma]: how this is going to evolve and was there a worry that how will you how will we make money how will

03:44:13.080 --> 03:44:17.480
[Amit Varma]: we reach enough people will our work have an impact you know you must have started with all

03:44:17.480 --> 03:44:23.880
[Amit Varma]: these worries obviously and immediately you you know had a bunch of impactful stories like a story

03:44:23.880 --> 03:44:28.200
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned with the with the cover no riot can last for more than 24 hours unless the state wants

03:44:28.200 --> 03:44:33.160
[Amit Varma]: it to continue which is a quote from a serving police officer which was picked up by you know

03:44:33.160 --> 03:44:39.560
[Amit Varma]: 34 indian publications and a series of successes after that but what were the early days like

03:44:39.560 --> 03:44:46.280
[Amit Varma]: because you know you you've made a move which is a move purely of conviction that this needs

03:44:46.280 --> 03:44:51.560
[Amit Varma]: to be done but what were the uncertainties there and how did you approach it how did you sort of

03:44:51.560 --> 03:44:56.280
[Amit Varma]: set that brief for yourself what are we going to do how are we going to do it it was not easy at

03:44:56.280 --> 03:45:00.920
[Guest]: all it was very tough and it was like i don't think commercially it was quote unquote successful

03:45:00.920 --> 03:45:09.400
[Guest]: or viable but and it 20 000 copies was the best selling number and by post and dispatches and

03:45:09.400 --> 03:45:13.480
[Guest]: all of that but i think it's pretty good yeah but it had an influence which was very disproportionate

03:45:13.480 --> 03:45:19.640
[Guest]: to the numbers you know because i mean and from day one we got this input that please ensure that

03:45:19.640 --> 03:45:24.200
[Guest]: comes out in hindi we never could do that because i think that was a real need that it should that

03:45:24.200 --> 03:45:30.120
[Guest]: kind of material should also be available in one of india's largest spoken languages but anyway

03:45:30.120 --> 03:45:34.680
[Guest]: those are all the unfortunately we had english speaking and writing journalists so uh yeah we

03:45:34.680 --> 03:45:40.600
[Guest]: had a string of quote-unquote journalistic successes it was recognized it was quoted in

03:45:40.600 --> 03:45:48.440
[Guest]: fact just the other day lolly and ramu admiral ramdas and lolly um uh who run who they wrote

03:45:48.440 --> 03:45:53.080
[Guest]: for six months we had to suspend publication then we got some friends did a show for us and

03:45:53.080 --> 03:45:58.360
[Guest]: collected some money and started it and all so that the reopening issue i remember where

03:45:59.160 --> 03:46:04.520
[Guest]: we went back to black and white and lots of stuff we had to do to cut corners so admiral ramdas and

03:46:04.520 --> 03:46:14.680
[Guest]: lolly wrote wrote this autobiographical piece on when they saw delhi burn when he was then and he

03:46:14.680 --> 03:46:19.160
[Guest]: was chief of indian navy as you know very powerful piece and just now she found a photograph of it

03:46:19.160 --> 03:46:23.160
[Guest]: and she said tisa is there an archival copy i said you're talking to an archivist i'll send you a

03:46:23.160 --> 03:46:30.360
[Guest]: copy but you know so you not only was it uh quote-unquote we have successes but we had the

03:46:30.360 --> 03:46:37.960
[Guest]: kind of writing and people writing on it who were actually sharing very very priceless insights and

03:46:39.320 --> 03:46:45.000
[Guest]: perspectives on targeted violence which i think was most precious about combat because whether

03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:48.600
[Guest]: it's this or the earlier piece you're talking about when vijay vijay tendulkar wrote that piece

03:46:48.600 --> 03:46:55.400
[Guest]: on muslims and i or suketu metha the writer shared us in a chapter of his book on partition where he

03:46:55.400 --> 03:47:02.520
[Guest]: particularly shared that excerpt on that one punjab village where the sikh elder had indulged

03:47:02.520 --> 03:47:08.200
[Guest]: in violence all of these actually cause a lot of introspection when you read them because it's not

03:47:08.200 --> 03:47:14.440
[Guest]: about that one story or it's not about that one narrative but it feeds into this the effort that

03:47:14.440 --> 03:47:22.760
[Guest]: combat was trying to make which is to understand and unravel the whys and and the wherefores of

03:47:22.760 --> 03:47:29.720
[Guest]: this kind of violence that erupts with within us and the fallout of it you know and in fact i sort

03:47:29.720 --> 03:47:34.760
[Guest]: of little flyer we used to put out when we were trying to get subscribers and supporters that you

03:47:34.760 --> 03:47:40.760
[Guest]: know the riot in the mind festers for days and months and years before it spills onto blood on

03:47:40.760 --> 03:47:46.440
[Guest]: the streets and we are trying to unravel that riot in the mind how does it get there who makes it

03:47:46.440 --> 03:47:51.640
[Guest]: happen what makes it happen is it our childhood is it something we hear is it the shaka is it

03:47:51.640 --> 03:47:55.880
[Guest]: something else you know so i think that exploration is what made it so special

03:47:57.960 --> 03:48:02.600
[Amit Varma]: that essay you mentioned vijay tendulkar muslims and i i want to quote a little bit from it

03:48:02.600 --> 03:48:07.400
[Guest]: as i get to my next question he had narrated it to javed i remember yeah this entire thing yeah

03:48:09.080 --> 03:48:14.440
[Amit Varma]: a muslim meant someone with a beard the word also conjured up an unclean appearance uncouth behavior

03:48:14.440 --> 03:48:19.720
[Amit Varma]: lack of education and culture a muslim was someone you stayed away from contact with them in any form

03:48:19.720 --> 03:48:24.600
[Amit Varma]: was supposed to be dangerous i still remember a common expression very frequently heard in casual

03:48:24.600 --> 03:48:29.560
[Amit Varma]: conversations among white-collared adults manu sahas ka musliman are you a human being or a

03:48:29.560 --> 03:48:34.440
[Amit Varma]: muslim a stop quote and he also speaks about how this was once asked in a classroom and

03:48:34.440 --> 03:48:42.600
[Amit Varma]: you know the student didn't mind it and what struck me as uh you know uh as a revelation the

03:48:42.600 --> 03:48:48.200
[Amit Varma]: one thing i really didn't know about 2002 till i read your book is how many years it was in the

03:48:48.200 --> 03:48:57.480
[Amit Varma]: making right and you had before 2002 happened in communalism combat you had five stories which were

03:48:57.480 --> 03:49:03.480
[Amit Varma]: just on what is happening in gujarat and they have the headlines are in august 1998 is the first of

03:49:03.480 --> 03:49:09.320
[Amit Varma]: those welcome to hindu rashtra then there's one on conversions then how textbooks teach prejudice

03:49:09.320 --> 03:49:17.800
[Amit Varma]: face to face with fascism and split wide open in feb 2001 right and you've pointed out in such

03:49:17.800 --> 03:49:24.280
[Amit Varma]: detail how the preparation for the riots you know right down to instruction manuals and so on was

03:49:24.280 --> 03:49:33.640
[Amit Varma]: done in incredible detail for years and godhra was just a pretext you know any other sort of spark

03:49:33.640 --> 03:49:39.160
[Amit Varma]: might well have worked and it wasn't really just modi modi had just kind of come that year this is

03:49:39.160 --> 03:49:45.400
[Amit Varma]: our society this is a movement this is what was going on tell me a little bit about this and the

03:49:45.400 --> 03:49:51.320
[Amit Varma]: reason i read that excerpt out also is it it's again the seen in the unseen right the muslim is

03:49:51.320 --> 03:49:58.280
[Amit Varma]: unseen it's not concrete and it also speaks to the kind of ghettoization which you've described in

03:49:58.280 --> 03:50:04.680
[Amit Varma]: great detail also which was there in uh gujarat especially and there is this very cities and

03:50:04.680 --> 03:50:10.680
[Amit Varma]: borders cities are borders and there was this very moving quote by ahsan jafri where apparently he was

03:50:10.680 --> 03:50:14.840
[Amit Varma]: in a riot in the late late 60s and then somebody said why are you still living here why don't you

03:50:14.840 --> 03:50:19.720
[Amit Varma]: go and live where you'll be safe and he said no that's not my idea of india my idea of india is

03:50:19.720 --> 03:50:24.920
[Amit Varma]: where i can live anywhere and feel safe and and so tragic given what happened rangbir bhai his

03:50:24.920 --> 03:50:30.680
[Guest]: son tried to tell him just a year or two before the massacre that you the your your area your

03:50:30.680 --> 03:50:40.600
[Guest]: trade union people have changed anyway and he was cauterized and killed but no so the the i mentioned

03:50:40.600 --> 03:50:47.400
[Guest]: earlier in our conversation about 1991 and that khan sahib being pushed off the this thing so that

03:50:47.400 --> 03:50:52.920
[Guest]: is also the build-up that is even before combat so so this is something i'd been following i'd been

03:50:52.920 --> 03:50:57.240
[Guest]: following about gujarat and it just bother me because see at the end of the day my ancestors

03:50:57.240 --> 03:51:03.240
[Guest]: are from there i'm a gujarati i i spent at least one or two holidays a year in ahmedabad because

03:51:03.240 --> 03:51:07.720
[Guest]: my mother's maika my mother's mama was there we would go by gujarat mail we'd stay there

03:51:07.720 --> 03:51:14.280
[Guest]: dhargarh old city the cloth market the bera famous mutton samosas which my father would bring they

03:51:14.280 --> 03:51:19.400
[Guest]: were all part of one's upbringing so one knew ahmedabad and yet one was seeing this happening

03:51:19.400 --> 03:51:26.600
[Guest]: later much later as a journalist and as an activist and as combat particularly and you saw

03:51:26.600 --> 03:51:36.120
[Guest]: the lawyers associations getting bifurcated you saw teachers associations othering the muslims

03:51:36.120 --> 03:51:42.120
[Guest]: i mentioned earlier to you that i mean i was appalled because i chief justice of india later

03:51:42.120 --> 03:51:48.840
[Guest]: much later this is emma d one of our best chief justices hails from ahmedabad and a horrific

03:51:48.840 --> 03:51:52.920
[Guest]: story i heard from senior lawyers at that time was that when he was first appointed

03:51:52.920 --> 03:51:58.040
[Guest]: as chief justice and this i heard retrospectively he said several sessions lower courts went on

03:51:58.040 --> 03:52:02.520
[Guest]: strike how could a muslim be a chief justice i mean this unheard of in any other part of india

03:52:02.520 --> 03:52:08.680
[Guest]: at that time so what was it about gujarat that this was possible why was it happening

03:52:08.680 --> 03:52:14.520
[Guest]: who was making it happen and i remember one of the in face to face with fascism i tried to deal

03:52:14.520 --> 03:52:20.760
[Guest]: with some of this in earlier stories i tried to deal with it uh is is ask this question that

03:52:20.760 --> 03:52:28.360
[Guest]: what was it about the gujarat's uh socio-political territory the political economy that allowed this

03:52:28.360 --> 03:52:33.880
[Guest]: kind of othering to happen so one of course i said before that i think there was a particular vhp rss

03:52:33.880 --> 03:52:40.200
[Guest]: project that discredited gandhi because gandhi was their biggest hurdle uh in terms of hindurashtra

03:52:40.200 --> 03:52:45.240
[Guest]: you know so they they got him dead but they couldn't kill him so easily so so discredit him

03:52:45.240 --> 03:52:50.440
[Guest]: in the line but that was a broad sweep statement what what next i think the fact that like i said

03:52:50.440 --> 03:52:55.720
[Guest]: earlier that anti-caste movement social reform movements only went up to so much and didn't go

03:52:55.720 --> 03:53:00.280
[Guest]: further in gurus not that there were no movements but they didn't go as radically deep as say they

03:53:00.280 --> 03:53:05.480
[Guest]: went in maharashtra or karnataka or whatever i think that was important the other another factor

03:53:05.480 --> 03:53:10.680
[Guest]: was that so for instance dalits they will call themselves harijan they won't call themselves

03:53:10.680 --> 03:53:16.920
[Guest]: dalit you know and i think the trade unions only are mostly gandhian and socialist they're not

03:53:16.920 --> 03:53:23.560
[Guest]: really left except in certain pockets so these are some of the patchy sort of insights one started

03:53:23.560 --> 03:53:30.120
[Guest]: getting or started this thing and then girish bhai patel was a senior lawyer and activist

03:53:30.120 --> 03:53:34.840
[Guest]: amazing personality i would have conversations with him and others and try and understand

03:53:34.840 --> 03:53:40.200
[Guest]: what is it about gujarat and talk about the land reform movement never having gone below the patel

03:53:40.200 --> 03:53:47.320
[Guest]: community patel is like the forward obc like the maratha years so you didn't really have land

03:53:47.320 --> 03:53:52.040
[Guest]: getting into the hand of dalit farmers but then how many states has it gone even punjab you've

03:53:52.040 --> 03:53:58.120
[Guest]: not had it gone to dalit farmers but still you don't have this level of deep-rooted communalization

03:53:58.120 --> 03:54:05.000
[Guest]: so it's a complex story not yet figured it all out but one certainly was doing reportage and

03:54:05.560 --> 03:54:11.560
[Guest]: investigations to warn people that something awful seemed to be nothing because there was

03:54:11.560 --> 03:54:18.280
[Guest]: this galvanization of the mob our private armies weaponization all of that threshold distribution

03:54:18.280 --> 03:54:24.600
[Guest]: so anytime there was this group of people fed on hatred and narratives that was available for

03:54:24.600 --> 03:54:29.400
[Guest]: a project and you know unfortunately we saw that happen so i think that is why i did those stories

03:54:29.400 --> 03:54:36.120
[Guest]: and it was no great satisfaction for me long before 2002 at every meeting one would address

03:54:36.120 --> 03:54:41.480
[Guest]: to keep telling people that please pay attention to gujarat something terrible seems to be building

03:54:41.480 --> 03:54:49.400
[Guest]: up there we are not paying enough attention and i think and we're very very sad to say that it

03:54:49.400 --> 03:54:55.080
[Guest]: happened and you know the one thing i wanted to just mention because so many things i when i go

03:54:55.080 --> 03:55:01.240
[Guest]: back to those cover stories i did the first one that you mentioned welcome to hindurashtra 1998

03:55:02.440 --> 03:55:08.280
[Guest]: just the one after that we did one on the taliban in afghanistan which is what combat was about i'm

03:55:08.280 --> 03:55:16.280
[Guest]: mentioning that was hell on earth and i did this telephonic std call interview with the revolutionary

03:55:16.280 --> 03:55:22.120
[Guest]: association of afghan women and nobody in south asia at that time certainly not india today

03:55:22.120 --> 03:55:28.120
[Guest]: our premiere magazine sunday magazine none of them were bothering to look at the you know

03:55:28.120 --> 03:55:34.440
[Guest]: majoritarianism there or whatever it was only after bamiyan buddhas in 2001 that everybody started

03:55:34.440 --> 03:55:38.920
[Guest]: waking up to what the taliban was but but we were trying to look at this everywhere

03:55:38.920 --> 03:55:45.400
[Guest]: i'm trying to look at i mean i visited uh uh sri lanka in 1997 and wrote about the majority and

03:55:45.400 --> 03:55:49.960
[Guest]: buddhist tendencies there so one was trying to understand this as a phenomenon not just to do

03:55:49.960 --> 03:55:56.680
[Guest]: with the hindu religion but whenever the majority hindu religion gets means majority religion gets

03:55:57.240 --> 03:56:02.600
[Guest]: close to state power what are the potential disasters that can happen so coming back to that

03:56:02.600 --> 03:56:08.360
[Guest]: welcome to hindurashtra story you know it's not a coincidence that the two villages that

03:56:08.360 --> 03:56:12.440
[Guest]: are mentioned there which is based on a pocl report at the time randikpur and sanjeevi

03:56:13.320 --> 03:56:18.280
[Guest]: where for a three-month period after a brutal attack on the muslims living there they were

03:56:18.280 --> 03:56:22.840
[Guest]: living outside their village for three months till somehow they crept that is exactly the area

03:56:22.840 --> 03:56:29.160
[Guest]: around which bilkis was then in 2002 gang rape just outside randikpur so i mean what do these

03:56:29.160 --> 03:56:36.840
[Guest]: connections mean what does this trajectory mean what do we ignore as society and state for the

03:56:36.840 --> 03:56:43.400
[Guest]: build-up i mean i still remember doing this interview which is there in that issue of combat

03:56:43.400 --> 03:56:48.840
[Guest]: i think it is the same issue welcome to hindurashtra where i interviewed uh then director

03:56:48.840 --> 03:56:54.360
[Guest]: general of police cp singh and i asked him i said listen you know there's this constant rumors of

03:56:54.360 --> 03:56:59.480
[Guest]: love jihad the love jihad was not a phrase till after the bamiyan buddhas but inter inter-community

03:56:59.480 --> 03:57:03.800
[Guest]: marriages and all rumors around them that they are forced and they are this thing in fact babu

03:57:03.800 --> 03:57:09.560
[Guest]: badrangi went into a whole racket with patel girls at that time uh and i said that how true is it

03:57:09.560 --> 03:57:15.720
[Guest]: that these forced marriages are happening you know the gujarat government under keshubhai patel

03:57:15.720 --> 03:57:21.480
[Guest]: had set up a cell in the police to investigate inter-community marriages a completely

03:57:21.480 --> 03:57:26.280
[Guest]: unconstitutional act because once you're above 18 you can marry whom you want in this country but

03:57:26.280 --> 03:57:29.960
[Guest]: yet the gujarat government had done this so it was the government that was functioning out of

03:57:29.960 --> 03:57:35.880
[Guest]: the purview of the indian constitution for a long time i asked director general this question he

03:57:35.880 --> 03:57:41.320
[Guest]: said all those stories are based on rumors and they're untrue we have investigated each one of

03:57:41.320 --> 03:57:48.200
[Guest]: these cases and they're all voluntary marriages i've quoted him in combat on that so the rational

03:57:48.200 --> 03:57:53.160
[Guest]: the rational debate is one thing the facts are something else but yet something completely

03:57:53.160 --> 03:57:58.520
[Amit Varma]: different is happening on the ground and just to underscore the variety of stories you were

03:57:58.520 --> 03:58:04.520
[Amit Varma]: covering you also did a cover story in september 2004 on bangladeshi hindus living with terror

03:58:04.520 --> 03:58:09.720
[Amit Varma]: minorities in bangladesh you know you've mentioned javed's critique of the jamaat-e-islami

03:58:09.720 --> 03:58:14.120
[Amit Varma]: uh where he wrote a piece called reluctant democrats so you know you've been sort of

03:58:14.120 --> 03:58:19.320
[Guest]: we wrote on the islamization of kashmir yeah i mean which is was such a personal tragedy for me

03:58:19.320 --> 03:58:25.160
[Guest]: because we sought kashmiris as resistant in a secular fashion and then you see because of

03:58:25.160 --> 03:58:31.960
[Guest]: infiltration from pakistan you see the islamization of that movement all that is being reported in

03:58:31.960 --> 03:58:36.680
[Guest]: combat true to our word that you know minority communalism feeds into majority communalism and

03:58:36.680 --> 03:58:42.680
[Amit Varma]: we were constantly having our antennas up for it remarkable you know some of the things that you

03:58:42.680 --> 03:58:47.880
[Amit Varma]: mentioned in the build-up to godhra what was happening in gujarat really struck me like you

03:58:47.880 --> 03:58:55.160
[Amit Varma]: speak uh you've written about this uh session in amitabad in september 2001 where you wrote about

03:58:55.160 --> 03:59:01.640
[Amit Varma]: how during this uh three-day training of dalit and muslim women quote dalit women spoke of the

03:59:01.640 --> 03:59:06.520
[Amit Varma]: rss slash bajrang dal luring their sons at three thousand four thousand per month to attend camps

03:59:06.520 --> 03:59:12.120
[Amit Varma]: where they were taught how to wield lathis and arms muslim women spoke of how the how their

03:59:12.120 --> 03:59:16.920
[Amit Varma]: children were not allowed to carry eggs in their tiffin to school abuses among the community had

03:59:16.920 --> 03:59:23.480
[Amit Varma]: become sharper and uh shriller uh stop quote and elsewhere you write about how as part of a cover

03:59:23.480 --> 03:59:29.400
[Amit Varma]: story you were doing you got you accessed an anonymous pamphlet which was what being widely

03:59:29.400 --> 03:59:35.000
[Amit Varma]: circulated that had hindutva uh that had a hindutva and om symbol and quote it was a detailed

03:59:35.000 --> 03:59:40.360
[Amit Varma]: instruction manual for the carders on how to file false complaints and mislead the police after

03:59:40.360 --> 03:59:46.280
[Amit Varma]: leading violent attacks a senior gujarat serving police officer had used this circular widely in

03:59:46.280 --> 03:59:52.440
[Amit Varma]: trainings to warn carders of the gujarat police on the dangers posed by such supremacist organization

03:59:52.440 --> 03:59:59.800
[Amit Varma]: stop quote and obviously uh you know uh ashish khaitan later in 2007 um the tehelka operation

03:59:59.800 --> 04:00:05.320
[Amit Varma]: kalang that he did spoke about how bombs guns and other weaponry had been brought to gujarat

04:00:05.320 --> 04:00:09.560
[Amit Varma]: from punjab rajasthan and other states months before the mass killing stop code this was also

04:00:09.560 --> 04:00:15.080
[Amit Varma]: a quote so you know all of this is happening and i think you mentioned uh in your book that just a

04:00:15.080 --> 04:00:21.000
[Amit Varma]: week before godhra you want someone in bangalore and they just laughed at you laughed and got angry

04:00:21.000 --> 04:00:25.000
[Guest]: in fact some of them laughed but one of my friends from gujarat are angry saying why do you keep on

04:00:25.000 --> 04:00:30.200
[Guest]: saying this at every meeting i said because i really sensing a terrible fear that there's a

04:00:30.200 --> 04:00:37.160
[Amit Varma]: build-up and that build-up is something we are ignoring so tell me about um february 27 2002

04:00:37.160 --> 04:00:42.680
[Guest]: when your phone started ringing oh it was one of those awful days because i think it started ringing

04:00:43.560 --> 04:00:51.560
[Guest]: from early morning about soon after 9 9 15 9 30 and i must have got i think over 170 200 calls that

04:00:51.560 --> 04:00:58.280
[Guest]: day and uh you know mobiles i mean i keep telling people that mobile phones were very expensive at

04:00:58.280 --> 04:01:03.240
[Guest]: that time 22 rupees a minute so it was not like today when you have all these different cheap

04:01:03.240 --> 04:01:09.640
[Guest]: packages so it must have cost people a lot of money to call and and there were desperate calls

04:01:09.640 --> 04:01:16.200
[Guest]: all over districts people whom i had met through all my coverage and network and activism who were

04:01:16.200 --> 04:01:23.480
[Guest]: just reporting on the fear and helplessness after the godhra incident because already the mobilizations

04:01:23.480 --> 04:01:28.360
[Guest]: had started and they were worried that they would be targeted so one just spent the next two and a

04:01:28.360 --> 04:01:34.440
[Guest]: half three days just making calls to police officers district officers sps calling delhi

04:01:34.440 --> 04:01:41.320
[Guest]: calling people like nirmala nirmala deshpande whoever one could think of to motivate them to

04:01:41.320 --> 04:01:50.200
[Guest]: do whatever they could it was a very desperate time and then the next day the violence started

04:01:50.200 --> 04:01:55.960
[Amit Varma]: uh first amitabad and then all the villages and i was struck by this sentence where you write

04:01:55.960 --> 04:02:01.240
[Amit Varma]: quote my phone records carry in them the geography of the attacks the root of the violence from one

04:02:01.240 --> 04:02:07.160
[Amit Varma]: end of gujarat to another stop quote and i you know i remember after the tsunami that had struck

04:02:07.160 --> 04:02:12.760
[Amit Varma]: i had traveled down um the coast of tamil nadu with a friend and one of the things that i that

04:02:12.760 --> 04:02:17.480
[Amit Varma]: really struck me and i remember writing about it is that everywhere where we went where the tsunami

04:02:17.480 --> 04:02:22.280
[Amit Varma]: had hit the clocks had stopped and you could make out from the time on the stop clocks all across

04:02:22.280 --> 04:02:29.720
[Amit Varma]: the beach so it's it's it's like a mapping of that as well and in your case it's a phone records

04:02:30.600 --> 04:02:37.080
[Amit Varma]: so what was going on because one of the things that was different this time that you pointed out

04:02:37.080 --> 04:02:41.160
[Amit Varma]: is that earlier when you would call the police they would send someone they would do something

04:02:41.160 --> 04:02:46.200
[Amit Varma]: something would happen this time that wasn't the case not always i mean in some cases it

04:02:46.200 --> 04:02:51.240
[Guest]: happened it was obviously not universally like that but it and it was not just about me i mean

04:02:51.240 --> 04:02:55.960
[Guest]: you look at the reports of times of india indian express everybody at that time because the media

04:02:55.960 --> 04:03:02.040
[Guest]: was still doing a very decent job largely and they were reporting this there were distress calls which

04:03:02.040 --> 04:03:06.760
[Guest]: were not being responded to in fact i still remember one conversation with the lieutenant

04:03:06.760 --> 04:03:13.320
[Guest]: general of the army zameeruddin shah who was there and i recalled this with him later because he got

04:03:13.320 --> 04:03:19.240
[Guest]: very annoyed with me and somebody had passed on his number to me because of his availability

04:03:19.240 --> 04:03:25.480
[Guest]: because army had been called in by 28th of first first by first of march they were in place and he

04:03:25.480 --> 04:03:30.280
[Guest]: kept on saying that every time you're calling me and giving me details of where the attacks are

04:03:30.280 --> 04:03:34.520
[Guest]: taking place but actually when i'm telling the police they are saying that no they're not

04:03:34.520 --> 04:03:39.720
[Guest]: happening they're happening somewhere else so what is this he was very annoyed sounding not annoyed

04:03:39.720 --> 04:03:44.520
[Guest]: as irate he was probably hassled by all the calls so i just kept silent for a few minutes and i said

04:03:44.520 --> 04:03:50.520
[Guest]: sir this i i can only say that please decide which of the two bits of information are correct i won't

04:03:50.520 --> 04:03:55.080
[Guest]: say anything more and then there was completely stand silence and he said thank you and put on

04:03:55.080 --> 04:04:01.000
[Guest]: the phone because there was nothing else i could say but then i kept calling him and he kept taking

04:04:01.000 --> 04:04:05.080
[Guest]: the messages so it's it was not a it was not nice at all it was very very distasteful and

04:04:05.800 --> 04:04:12.680
[Guest]: it was clear that the the official explanation is that they were overwhelmed but it was very

04:04:12.680 --> 04:04:20.360
[Guest]: clear according to me that there was a lack of response when did you so when did you go there

04:04:21.000 --> 04:04:27.320
[Amit Varma]: i went there on the third third of third of march in your book you've got this

04:04:28.120 --> 04:04:32.920
[Amit Varma]: striking paraway you write quote on fourth march i was at a relief camp the shah alam camp in

04:04:32.920 --> 04:04:37.400
[Amit Varma]: amidabad i remember meeting women from naroda patia there they described how they had reached

04:04:37.400 --> 04:04:42.280
[Amit Varma]: the dargah they came with no clothes on when they were rescued a humiliation easy to recount but

04:04:42.280 --> 04:04:46.600
[Amit Varma]: difficult to comprehend this meant they had been stripped of clothes and dignity apart from being

04:04:46.600 --> 04:04:51.640
[Amit Varma]: physically abused for the better part of 12 to 13 hours they sat in that state at the police station

04:04:51.640 --> 04:04:58.280
[Amit Varma]: they had been brought back bloodied bruised and naked to the camp stop quote and later you write

04:04:58.280 --> 04:05:03.000
[Amit Varma]: quote it is chilling that for seven to eight hours the whole locality was actually enjoying

04:05:03.000 --> 04:05:08.360
[Amit Varma]: a massacre when you have women and men celebrating the persistent hounding and killing including the

04:05:08.360 --> 04:05:13.080
[Amit Varma]: daylight rapes of young girls and women it is reflective of the public space before and after

04:05:13.080 --> 04:05:19.640
[Amit Varma]: the macabre violence such violence also qualitatively affects the space in that area

04:05:19.640 --> 04:05:25.320
[Amit Varma]: stop couldn't you go on this of course reminds me of hannah arendt's phrase the banality of evil but

04:05:25.320 --> 04:05:31.400
[Amit Varma]: what tells and this is a story we heard time and time again even bilkis bano's rapists and the

04:05:31.400 --> 04:05:36.440
[Amit Varma]: killers of her child and all the all the family members were our neighbors there were people

04:05:36.440 --> 04:05:41.960
[Amit Varma]: around her there were people otherwise you would consider just normal people and at a time like

04:05:41.960 --> 04:05:47.080
[Amit Varma]: this you have an entire locality just chilling out enjoying a massacre as it happens and

04:05:47.080 --> 04:05:54.440
[Amit Varma]: apparently not feeling a thing and when we speak of the rule of law you know you can convict a few

04:05:54.440 --> 04:06:01.400
[Amit Varma]: people you can convict ringleaders as indeed you have right some of them you have some of them yeah

04:06:01.400 --> 04:06:09.480
[Amit Varma]: yeah but the point is everybody participated and that's just such a horrifying thought that

04:06:09.480 --> 04:06:15.400
[Amit Varma]: everybody participated like you've spoken of many victims who cannot go back to where they lived

04:06:15.400 --> 04:06:23.080
[Amit Varma]: where all this happened to them but even those who go back i can't imagine the kind of denial they

04:06:23.080 --> 04:06:28.360
[Amit Varma]: must have to live in when they know that the people around them are the people who did all of

04:06:28.360 --> 04:06:33.080
[Amit Varma]: this you know and it's not just a handful of people and a handful of ruffians and a handful of

04:06:34.120 --> 04:06:40.520
[Amit Varma]: you know ringleaders how does one come to terms with that no actually that is why i think it's

04:06:40.520 --> 04:06:45.320
[Guest]: very important to grapple with this question further and move out of just naroda party also

04:06:45.320 --> 04:06:50.600
[Guest]: look at the whole phenomenon come back to partition look at rwanda because i met i met

04:06:50.600 --> 04:06:59.640
[Guest]: i met this amazing activist who worked in rwanda and she was telling me once that what happens when

04:07:00.280 --> 04:07:05.880
[Guest]: every person from the utus with has been involved in the massacre of tootsies you know there's not

04:07:05.880 --> 04:07:10.760
[Guest]: a single family that's not been involved so you're talking about an entire section of people

04:07:11.400 --> 04:07:17.480
[Guest]: you know including catholic nuns sometimes you know horrific stories that came out of

04:07:17.480 --> 04:07:23.960
[Guest]: rwanda at that time the 800 000 people massacred so what is it that drives populations to this

04:07:24.600 --> 04:07:30.680
[Guest]: level of an expanse of bestiality and more important as you said how do you recover from

04:07:30.680 --> 04:07:36.040
[Guest]: it how does a society then re-engage with each other and reconstruct i mean it's like

04:07:36.600 --> 04:07:41.880
[Guest]: i mean for me it's extremely difficult to find i can't give any recipe or this thing because it has

04:07:41.880 --> 04:07:49.800
[Guest]: to be through the voices of the survivors who tell us the solutions we cannot cannot in any means

04:07:49.800 --> 04:07:55.400
[Guest]: give a solution to them it has to be a solution that maybe we can help facilitate as sensitive

04:07:55.400 --> 04:07:59.720
[Guest]: human beings but how can we be the ones who give it to them i have no answer to that but i just

04:07:59.720 --> 04:08:05.080
[Guest]: feel and this is what i keep urging people that as a society we cannot turn our blind eye to what

04:08:05.080 --> 04:08:09.720
[Guest]: we are unleashing on our own people and we can't do this by shutting out conversations as if it

04:08:09.720 --> 04:08:15.160
[Guest]: didn't happen or by blurring the narrative or turning the narrative on its head or saying that

04:08:15.160 --> 04:08:19.720
[Guest]: you know this is all spontaneous or i mean at least let's engage with the kind of horrors that

04:08:19.720 --> 04:08:24.600
[Guest]: we've been able to at least those that we witness in our lifetimes you know even if partition is

04:08:24.600 --> 04:08:31.640
[Guest]: too far back and it is difficult to reconstruct every single incident or every area and region

04:08:31.640 --> 04:08:37.800
[Guest]: and which community was affected at least what we know is is that that is reasonably true that

04:08:37.800 --> 04:08:43.880
[Guest]: it has happened it's been reported and before anybody kind of accuses me of you know saying

04:08:43.880 --> 04:08:48.040
[Guest]: what i said about naroda bhatt you just have to read the judgment of judge jyotsnaya yagnik

04:08:48.040 --> 04:08:55.640
[Guest]: which came out on 29th of august 2012 and what she speaks and how and the credibility she gives and

04:08:55.640 --> 04:09:00.840
[Guest]: and the way she talks about the integrity of the witnesses who have spoken up and for me that

04:09:00.840 --> 04:09:07.000
[Guest]: experience of supporting those women survivors that that cjp did was that for the first time in

04:09:07.000 --> 04:09:11.880
[Guest]: the history of this country the narrative of gender violence was brought back during a trial

04:09:11.880 --> 04:09:17.720
[Guest]: normally the court process blurs it out it sanitizes it or refuses to admit it for the

04:09:17.720 --> 04:09:23.400
[Guest]: first time it was possible and that was that brief glimmer that the supreme court monitoring

04:09:23.400 --> 04:09:28.600
[Guest]: gave this process before it sort of sunk into something else was that these were supreme

04:09:28.600 --> 04:09:32.600
[Guest]: court monitored trials they were specially appointed judges some of them so certain

04:09:32.600 --> 04:09:38.840
[Guest]: integrity to some of those processes existed not all but i think that's the learning experience

04:09:38.840 --> 04:09:43.560
[Guest]: that as a society it's not about these as well it's not about gujarat 2002 could be about nelly

04:09:43.560 --> 04:09:49.800
[Guest]: it could be about 84 i mean how many sikh families have got justice for 84 compared i mean i think

04:09:49.800 --> 04:09:55.080
[Guest]: it's equally shameful i think it's important to as a society are we going to accept and

04:09:55.080 --> 04:10:01.480
[Guest]: deliberate with some sensitivity on what makes us fall prey to this level of bestiality and violence

04:10:01.480 --> 04:10:07.640
[Guest]: for me that's the abiding question it's not about one individual or one state but it's how an entire

04:10:07.640 --> 04:10:14.280
[Amit Varma]: neighborhood can do this what are your candidate answers to that rhetorical question about what

04:10:14.280 --> 04:10:21.320
[Amit Varma]: makes us do this like is this really uh is this really the human condition is all this uh civil

04:10:21.320 --> 04:10:27.560
[Amit Varma]: society a sort of a facade and everything is contingent and yes there but for the grace of god

04:10:27.560 --> 04:10:33.240
[Guest]: go i you know if i were to accept that then i would not get stories which i got out of gujarat

04:10:33.240 --> 04:10:38.680
[Guest]: also which we did good news gujarat one whole cover story we did a year later in july 2003

04:10:38.680 --> 04:10:44.600
[Guest]: june 2003 which is that whether it was sardarpura where 33 people were massacred in one house

04:10:44.600 --> 04:10:50.760
[Guest]: sheikh moella or whether it was godhra or whether it was even ahmedabad ahmedabad naroda you have

04:10:50.760 --> 04:10:56.920
[Guest]: the most outstanding stories of bravery in the midst of that bestiality yes they were a minority

04:10:56.920 --> 04:11:03.320
[Guest]: they were kind of completely outnumbered but if if that was if the human condition was that

04:11:03.880 --> 04:11:10.280
[Guest]: brutal voyeurism then why did those acts take place is my question why did those policemen

04:11:11.160 --> 04:11:16.200
[Guest]: which were a hopeless minority stick their out necks out for the constitution

04:11:16.200 --> 04:11:22.680
[Guest]: and us even today paying for it you know uh there is always going to be this battle

04:11:22.680 --> 04:11:28.200
[Guest]: between the predominant majority majority narrative and the resistance and maybe at

04:11:28.920 --> 04:11:34.440
[Guest]: many many points of time the hate wins but i don't think hate wins all the time and i think

04:11:34.440 --> 04:11:38.920
[Guest]: anyway the endeavor for us should be at least the endeavor for people like us should be that

04:11:38.920 --> 04:11:45.640
[Guest]: one tries to interrogate which is what communism combat was what koj is what our work in assam is

04:11:45.640 --> 04:11:51.080
[Guest]: at the moment and that's why i would urge your your listeners to you know visit the cjp website

04:11:51.080 --> 04:11:56.920
[Guest]: cjp.org or dot in look at the kind of work we are doing it's it's many fold it's not just about

04:11:56.920 --> 04:12:02.280
[Guest]: targeted violence against minorities it's also about adivasis land and livelihood rights it's

04:12:02.280 --> 04:12:06.600
[Guest]: also about citizenship rights it's about constitutional values in the classroom hate

04:12:06.600 --> 04:12:10.680
[Guest]: hate watch is very much part is that what are the manner in which we can equip

04:12:11.800 --> 04:12:17.320
[Guest]: citizenry societies villages to ensure that the lone voices become the majority

04:12:18.200 --> 04:12:26.200
[Guest]: the lone voices which i still believe are many fold become a kind of cohesive majority and i

04:12:26.200 --> 04:12:31.720
[Guest]: feel that's the effort and that should be the effort that is a effort i think we do not have

04:12:31.720 --> 04:12:36.760
[Guest]: the luxury of saying that the human condition is the hateful condition i can't we cannot do that

04:12:36.760 --> 04:12:44.200
[Amit Varma]: we just cannot do that so when you went there uh you know you mentioned in your book about how

04:12:44.200 --> 04:12:51.000
[Amit Varma]: a friend asked you about how it was and you said remember how bad 92 93 was this is 1000 times

04:12:51.000 --> 04:12:58.200
[Amit Varma]: worse and another thing that comes across really well in your book is the extent of it it was not

04:12:58.200 --> 04:13:02.760
[Amit Varma]: just amitabad it was you know the majority of the districts in the state it was hundreds of

04:13:02.760 --> 04:13:07.800
[Amit Varma]: villages it was like targeted planned elsewhere you've also written about how in the months

04:13:07.800 --> 04:13:12.760
[Amit Varma]: preceding this there were these census documents drawn up of where muslims stay where christians

04:13:12.760 --> 04:13:18.360
[Amit Varma]: stay everything so you know that data was kind of made for a reason i think you showed it to

04:13:18.360 --> 04:13:24.840
[Amit Varma]: justice verma if i remember and he said he has similar data and what was that period like because

04:13:24.840 --> 04:13:29.240
[Guest]: you were attacked a number of times while you were yeah i was attacked five times including my

04:13:29.240 --> 04:13:34.520
[Guest]: the car and the driver leaving me in a village and going away justice verma himself witnessed

04:13:34.520 --> 04:13:39.560
[Guest]: when he was in the car in front when my car the back was attacked before turned into godhra

04:13:41.960 --> 04:13:45.000
[Guest]: there were ad-hoc attacks towards anybody who was trying to

04:13:47.080 --> 04:13:52.520
[Guest]: record or witness any of the violence that takes place i still remember this elderly gentleman in

04:13:52.520 --> 04:13:56.680
[Guest]: jamalpur telling me that beta if you're going to because i was the first journalist that is what

04:13:56.680 --> 04:14:01.800
[Guest]: the editors guild report says rights and wrongs that's a report which is worth reading that

04:14:06.840 --> 04:14:10.520
[Guest]: which says that you know the communism combat was the only one that carried the rural

04:14:11.720 --> 04:14:15.880
[Guest]: spread of the violence because i was the first one who visited so i remember this elderly gent

04:14:15.880 --> 04:14:19.960
[Guest]: telling me that uh if you're going to go out of amdabad then remember you just wear a

04:14:19.960 --> 04:14:24.680
[Guest]: uh to put wear a saffron dupatta and a tikka otherwise without that you'll be

04:14:25.720 --> 04:14:32.440
[Guest]: targeted so you know there was all of that hotelieries 1100 hotels belonging to the muslim

04:14:32.440 --> 04:14:39.640
[Guest]: chilya community had been brutalized i mean you know the economic loss and devastation was

04:14:39.640 --> 04:14:46.280
[Guest]: as bad as the loss of human lives which we calculated post godhra to be 1928 or

04:14:46.280 --> 04:14:53.720
[Guest]: whatever according to the chart sheets close to 2000 1920 and you know as indians we tend to not

04:14:54.280 --> 04:15:00.520
[Guest]: count the numbers about loss we think that we try to valorize only the lives lost but i think

04:15:00.520 --> 04:15:08.120
[Guest]: you know even the cii put the loss at several thousand crores you know so this was all a

04:15:08.120 --> 04:15:14.360
[Guest]: matter of record and the national human rights commission's report interim report final report

04:15:14.360 --> 04:15:21.400
[Guest]: follow-up reports the chief election commissioner lindow's report of 2002 they document some of this

04:15:21.400 --> 04:15:26.520
[Guest]: apart from the work that some of us have done so but there is still a desire today to change

04:15:26.520 --> 04:15:31.640
[Guest]: the narrative to turn the narrative around i mean history will tell as to how far that will go

04:15:34.600 --> 04:15:40.680
[Amit Varma]: tell me now about how citizens for justice and peace cjp came about like at what point

04:15:40.680 --> 04:15:45.560
[Amit Varma]: uh did you feel the need for something like this that what you guys were doing

04:15:45.560 --> 04:15:50.600
[Amit Varma]: there needed to be another superstructure on top of that it just it wasn't enough tell me about that

04:15:50.600 --> 04:15:57.560
[Guest]: whole process actually the organization was born out of the realization that you know we need to

04:15:57.560 --> 04:16:05.320
[Guest]: have a group of citizens involved in the civil and legal rights issue which will look at supporting

04:16:05.320 --> 04:16:10.760
[Guest]: survivors of targeted violence then we look at the whole issue of constitutional values in the

04:16:10.760 --> 04:16:15.800
[Guest]: classroom and now we're looking at citizenship rights so basically legal rights and legal aid

04:16:16.600 --> 04:16:24.920
[Guest]: is the concept behind cjp and you know if we wanted to engage in battling those cases

04:16:24.920 --> 04:16:28.760
[Guest]: of course gujarat 2002 but not only that because we've also done

04:16:28.760 --> 04:16:37.560
[Guest]: engagements with bomb blast survivors 26 11 before that in gujarat etc uh it's important to

04:16:38.600 --> 04:16:43.080
[Guest]: see what that whole process of engagement will mean it means understanding the law it means

04:16:43.960 --> 04:16:51.320
[Guest]: legal aid it means uh staying with the survivor for for periods of time that are long because our

04:16:51.320 --> 04:16:57.160
[Guest]: court process takes so long you know and advocacy and all of that so that is why it was set up and

04:16:57.160 --> 04:17:03.400
[Guest]: many of the persons then and now were involved in cjp had seen bombay burn in 92 93 so i thought that

04:17:03.400 --> 04:17:08.840
[Guest]: was a very important understanding and link that came out of that now of course we have some new

04:17:08.840 --> 04:17:17.640
[Guest]: people also and the it was very important to have that that thing in place now i just want to say

04:17:17.640 --> 04:17:22.120
[Guest]: that you know the experience we got out of 92 93 bombay where we didn't actually engage in the

04:17:22.120 --> 04:17:27.400
[Guest]: courts but we were engaged in the campaigning for the sri krishna commission report to make sure the

04:17:27.400 --> 04:17:31.960
[Guest]: report was published getting it published we actually published the report two editions of it

04:17:31.960 --> 04:17:35.480
[Guest]: was also very important to understand that you know that do we stop there or do we now get into

04:17:35.480 --> 04:17:40.920
[Guest]: the courts and also battle the cases so that was one part of the story and now we've actually

04:17:40.920 --> 04:17:46.040
[Guest]: reached a stage which is very fascinating because i think the experience has also meant that you

04:17:46.040 --> 04:17:51.080
[Guest]: know for for human rights and civil liberties and legal aid to be used in the courts and to

04:17:51.080 --> 04:17:57.960
[Guest]: and legal aid to be sustaining and enduring we need to create local teams on the ground so

04:17:57.960 --> 04:18:04.360
[Guest]: therefore to have this team that's going in asam which is a really vibrant team of 25 plus people

04:18:04.360 --> 04:18:09.560
[Guest]: paralegal and lawyers who are working on the question of citizenship i don't know how many

04:18:09.560 --> 04:18:16.520
[Guest]: people in the rest of india know but this whole nrc process national register of citizens process

04:18:16.520 --> 04:18:23.640
[Guest]: which which it's important to tell your listeners this because you know asam has a 3.3 crore

04:18:23.640 --> 04:18:29.080
[Guest]: roughly population and at least a third of them are kind of completely being

04:18:32.040 --> 04:18:38.120
[Guest]: there's a humanitarian crisis of huge proportions so there's a background and trajectory to it but

04:18:38.120 --> 04:18:45.640
[Guest]: the conflict and the violence in asam pre and post the asam accord has led to kind of

04:18:45.640 --> 04:18:51.720
[Guest]: led to kind of demand quote unquote that outsiders should be identified and citizens should be

04:18:53.080 --> 04:18:58.200
[Guest]: citizenship should be scrutinized in a particular way and the matter was taken to the supreme court

04:18:58.200 --> 04:19:02.760
[Guest]: and all of that it's a complicated thing and on the cjp website you get a lot of information about

04:19:02.760 --> 04:19:11.160
[Guest]: it in 2016-17 when the draft list was brought out draft final list as many as 44 lakh people

04:19:11.160 --> 04:19:17.080
[Guest]: were left out of citizenship which is like a huge number then when the final final list came in

04:19:18.680 --> 04:19:26.280
[Guest]: in 2019 which is august 31st the number came down to 19 lakhs now even that is being contested by

04:19:26.280 --> 04:19:31.720
[Guest]: the political class they seem to want to reopen it further but what has this entire process meant

04:19:31.720 --> 04:19:37.480
[Guest]: first of all it's a huge cost to the state exchequer figures like 1700 1800 crores are being

04:19:37.480 --> 04:19:43.960
[Guest]: crores are being thrown around this is the kind of money that has been worsted on this whole exercise

04:19:43.960 --> 04:19:48.280
[Guest]: but it has meant that virtually in every village in the state of asam you have families and

04:19:49.240 --> 04:19:55.800
[Guest]: extended families who are completely devastated by this and their meager allowances are being spent

04:19:55.800 --> 04:20:02.360
[Guest]: on you know trying to navigate a very very hostile legal system the foreigner tribunal

04:20:02.360 --> 04:20:08.040
[Guest]: etc now you have something a creature called the foreigner tribunal in asam which is a kind of a

04:20:08.040 --> 04:20:15.080
[Guest]: legal entity pre-independence under the foreigners act very complicated which is doesn't happen

04:20:15.080 --> 04:20:20.920
[Guest]: anywhere else in india and the the adjudication there the level of evidence gathering there is

04:20:20.920 --> 04:20:25.880
[Guest]: completely contra to what the indian evidence act says so you know all of this has meant

04:20:26.600 --> 04:20:32.200
[Guest]: first of all me and our team understanding this issue then us trying to do legal education with

04:20:32.200 --> 04:20:38.200
[Guest]: batch of lawyers who have been doing this for a long time but trying to discuss and how we can do

04:20:38.200 --> 04:20:42.600
[Guest]: it better understanding the superior court judgments high court and supreme court and

04:20:42.600 --> 04:20:47.560
[Guest]: trying to bring in national and international law so all this been a very intense exercise for the

04:20:47.560 --> 04:20:57.080
[Guest]: last seven years and we've been very lucky to build up a very very vibrant team and the work

04:20:57.080 --> 04:21:03.480
[Guest]: carries on day to day week to week and village to village in about 12 districts and for me the

04:21:03.480 --> 04:21:09.960
[Guest]: greatest satisfaction when i was incarcerated the last three four months is that the work of this

04:21:09.960 --> 04:21:16.360
[Guest]: kind whether it was hate watch or assam or constitutional class in the classroom in purvanchal

04:21:16.360 --> 04:21:20.920
[Guest]: continued and i think there was a first shell shocked of the first week when it all happened

04:21:20.920 --> 04:21:26.440
[Guest]: and i was arrested but after that teams galvanized and motivated each other and the work carried on

04:21:26.440 --> 04:21:31.080
[Guest]: and for me that is the biggest answer to this kind of strategy and this kind of targeting

04:21:31.080 --> 04:21:36.280
[Guest]: is that the work should not stop the work simply should not stop that's inspiring you know why

04:21:36.280 --> 04:21:41.320
[Amit Varma]: don't we see more of this particular asam problem in the mainstream media is it because there is

04:21:41.320 --> 04:21:46.520
[Amit Varma]: some kind of a north bias so much of media is happening from delhi what's the deal it's a gay

04:21:46.520 --> 04:21:51.960
[Guest]: it's a very good question i mean you will find almost zero coverage or even in the alternate

04:21:51.960 --> 04:21:57.240
[Guest]: portals actually because i mean a little bit comes into scroll and wire of course occasionally but

04:21:57.880 --> 04:22:01.800
[Guest]: i mean consistent coverage you'll only see on the cjp website or on the sabrang website because we

04:22:01.800 --> 04:22:06.920
[Guest]: are engaged there simply because we are getting that report and information but you know there's

04:22:06.920 --> 04:22:12.120
[Guest]: always been a bias in the quote-unquote indian media even when i'm talking about the better days

04:22:12.120 --> 04:22:17.720
[Guest]: of journalism i'm talking about the 80s and 70s against the northeast the east and the northeast

04:22:17.720 --> 04:22:23.880
[Guest]: orissa bengal and the seven sisters i mean the northeastern states are never covered never come

04:22:23.880 --> 04:22:29.640
[Guest]: so if there's a if there's violence there there's a conflict there if there are floods there maybe

04:22:29.640 --> 04:22:34.440
[Guest]: for a few days but not looking at some of these endemic problems which are being unleashed so

04:22:34.440 --> 04:22:40.680
[Guest]: according to me the quote-unquote commercial media nationally is doing very very big service

04:22:40.680 --> 04:22:47.480
[Guest]: disservice to the people of asam by not having regular coverage this changed a little bit around

04:22:47.480 --> 04:22:54.600
[Guest]: 2019 when the citizenship amendment bill was passed and all these protests erupted because

04:22:54.600 --> 04:23:01.080
[Guest]: inevitably some of us who had been working even before that on asam were asked to speak about how

04:23:01.080 --> 04:23:07.400
[Guest]: this has whole and this entire trajectory of proof of documented citizenship has unfolded in asam

04:23:07.400 --> 04:23:12.440
[Guest]: and when we started sharing the horrific experience there and warning that this could happen anywhere

04:23:12.440 --> 04:23:18.120
[Guest]: in india if this was not protested enough that is when there was a little bit of coverage in

04:23:18.120 --> 04:23:23.160
[Guest]: other places but very momentary because soon you had covid and the lockdown and you know media just

04:23:23.160 --> 04:23:29.240
[Amit Varma]: forgets these stories very quickly yeah it's a event to event and not really uh staying on for

04:23:29.240 --> 04:23:37.480
[Amit Varma]: longer with a story let's go back to the aftermath of 2002 and not just the aftermath 2002 itself

04:23:37.480 --> 04:23:45.240
[Amit Varma]: and at one point you speak about how you know there was this mob or vhp slash bajrang dal people

04:23:45.240 --> 04:23:53.480
[Amit Varma]: who were chanting with impunity police right and this is uh by commission or omission

04:23:54.840 --> 04:23:59.400
[Amit Varma]: you know this was true as you've documented in your book and elsewhere and as we kind of know

04:23:59.400 --> 04:24:03.560
[Amit Varma]: you've already you mentioned that anecdote about the general who told you that the police are

04:24:03.560 --> 04:24:07.880
[Amit Varma]: giving him locations of villages where nothing has happened and you know and no it's it was like

04:24:07.880 --> 04:24:12.280
[Guest]: in ahemdabad a certain direction would be pointed out when there was not but actually something's

04:24:12.280 --> 04:24:16.600
[Amit Varma]: happened somewhere else actually it's happened somewhere else so the you know willful misdirection

04:24:16.600 --> 04:24:21.800
[Amit Varma]: so on the one hand there is in fact he's he has written a book zamiruddin shah on the entire

04:24:21.800 --> 04:24:26.840
[Amit Varma]: experience of gujarat which is very interesting i'll link that from the show notes as well as

04:24:26.840 --> 04:24:32.280
[Amit Varma]: so many other links and so on the one hand there is a police which the moment that the state

04:24:32.280 --> 04:24:37.000
[Amit Varma]: government is of a particular dispensation the police is going along on the other hand you've

04:24:37.000 --> 04:24:43.800
[Amit Varma]: spoken about uh the judiciary and you have of course spoken about the outliers uh in the judiciary

04:24:43.800 --> 04:24:48.600
[Amit Varma]: like joshua yagnik who you know gave that great sort of judgment himanshu trivedi who left a

04:24:48.600 --> 04:24:53.960
[Amit Varma]: facebook message uh praising you uh you know ex-judge of the by tips in the retail in best

04:24:53.960 --> 04:25:01.400
[Amit Varma]: bakery yeah yeah so those seem like outliers more and more the worry is that if the dispensation in

04:25:01.400 --> 04:25:06.840
[Amit Varma]: power you know bends a particular way sooner or later they'll capture all the institutions and

04:25:06.840 --> 04:25:11.480
[Amit Varma]: this is something i discussed at length with josie joseph you know he's written a book on

04:25:11.480 --> 04:25:17.080
[Amit Varma]: the deep state so to say and that's again an eye-opening book in an eye-opening episode

04:25:17.960 --> 04:25:26.040
[Amit Varma]: so what what is your experience with this because on the one hand you come from literally a family

04:25:26.040 --> 04:25:32.760
[Amit Varma]: of people who've believed in this rule of law it's a co-tenant right and then you encounter

04:25:32.760 --> 04:25:38.920
[Amit Varma]: this system where it feels like a frustrating uphill battle but you stick to your principles

04:25:38.920 --> 04:25:43.880
[Amit Varma]: and you kind of continue down that path and you've had some success but you also had a lot

04:25:43.880 --> 04:25:50.200
[Amit Varma]: of frustration so how do you how do you look back on these struggles and do you you know

04:25:50.200 --> 04:25:56.520
[Amit Varma]: do you still hold out hope because to me it seems like you know just hoping that some

04:25:56.520 --> 04:26:02.840
[Amit Varma]: outstanding individual will make a good judgment that goes for you is you know systemically it just

04:26:02.840 --> 04:26:09.080
[Guest]: seems that you know while that is true i would put it the other way that the only way a system

04:26:09.080 --> 04:26:13.960
[Guest]: can be held accountable is through engagement with it if you decide to disengage completely

04:26:13.960 --> 04:26:18.760
[Guest]: with the system whether it is the uh police or the courts or the judiciary or the election

04:26:18.760 --> 04:26:23.480
[Guest]: election process electoral presidency i'm just not going to vote i don't know whether you're

04:26:23.480 --> 04:26:29.320
[Guest]: going to ever get it any hope of it any revival or reform or improvement so that's the broad

04:26:29.320 --> 04:26:34.760
[Guest]: sweep secondly i'd like to also point out apart from what josie's uh written look at two very

04:26:34.760 --> 04:26:41.560
[Guest]: outstanding recent interviews that karan has done on one was with justice ap shah and that

04:26:41.560 --> 04:26:46.440
[Guest]: piece he wrote in the hindu is actually what that interview is based on and it's somewhere

04:26:46.440 --> 04:26:52.840
[Guest]: like justice ap shah jeet prakash shah uh former law commission delhi high court uh chief justice

04:26:52.840 --> 04:26:58.520
[Guest]: you know writing that i'm sorry writing that in hindu and then elaborating at length in that

04:26:58.520 --> 04:27:03.800
[Guest]: interview and what is he saying you know he's saying that the challenges uh to the judiciary

04:27:03.800 --> 04:27:09.800
[Guest]: post 2014 and then you have of course uh senior counsel mr dushyant davey uh talking about our

04:27:09.800 --> 04:27:14.440
[Guest]: incoming chief justice so see these are issues that are being looked at with concern and debate

04:27:14.440 --> 04:27:19.080
[Guest]: and we've had judgments which are which have offered hope and their judgments which have

04:27:19.800 --> 04:27:23.400
[Guest]: raised huge alarm and concern i don't want to get into those individuals because

04:27:23.400 --> 04:27:29.720
[Guest]: individual cases because it would not be appropriate but i will say that uh an institution

04:27:29.720 --> 04:27:36.520
[Guest]: eventually if i talk about the judiciary here will be judged by the sum total of what it does

04:27:36.520 --> 04:27:45.880
[Guest]: and of course it will also be judged by its major what is seen to be major hurdles or obstacles when

04:27:45.880 --> 04:27:51.800
[Guest]: it has not met met the exacting standards of substantive justice however i'll also say that

04:27:53.400 --> 04:27:59.960
[Guest]: you know the ironic thing about this whole process is some of the irony that you yourself

04:27:59.960 --> 04:28:07.560
[Guest]: mentioned is that it's much easier not to battle in the courts i want to also mention this and

04:28:07.560 --> 04:28:11.880
[Guest]: flag this that it's much easy to do any sort of activism but does not involve the courts because

04:28:12.440 --> 04:28:16.600
[Guest]: and that is something that feminists have learned something that uh civil rights activists have

04:28:16.600 --> 04:28:22.600
[Guest]: learned that this is a far more quote-unquote demanding process it's when you're in the courts

04:28:22.600 --> 04:28:29.000
[Guest]: that the reprisal is greater because they're sworn affidavits and then the agents of the state

04:28:29.000 --> 04:28:34.520
[Guest]: representative of the states are going to be held accountable ostensibly for what they've done or

04:28:34.520 --> 04:28:43.000
[Guest]: not done so it is it is a far more problematic and risky but i see that not doing it at all or

04:28:43.000 --> 04:28:48.120
[Guest]: assuming i don't think anybody who engages in the courts whether it's a pucl or whether it's us or

04:28:48.120 --> 04:28:54.040
[Guest]: the association for democratic reforms or anybody does it with the hope that they're looking for

04:28:54.040 --> 04:29:02.840
[Guest]: that one messiah individual no but what you're looking for is some level of exacting this thing

04:29:02.840 --> 04:29:07.080
[Guest]: on constitutional values from an institution that's supposed to be a constitutional court

04:29:07.080 --> 04:29:11.320
[Guest]: whether it's a high court or a supreme court so i think it's with that hope that you go there

04:29:12.440 --> 04:29:17.560
[Guest]: otherwise you might as well say if you want extends your argument further that you know leave

04:29:17.560 --> 04:29:21.960
[Guest]: aside this battle to the courts wait or don't wait for that day when it happens and fight your battles

04:29:21.960 --> 04:29:26.760
[Guest]: elsewhere you know in the discursive arena in the communication arena and the media arena

04:29:27.320 --> 04:29:33.320
[Guest]: and i don't know whether that by itself is enough you know so neither is only this enough for sure

04:29:33.320 --> 04:29:39.080
[Guest]: like i've said earlier as well that if this battle takes place in isolation and there is no support

04:29:39.080 --> 04:29:44.360
[Guest]: from the public or from political class or from the opposition then too it gets rendered isolationist

04:29:44.360 --> 04:29:52.200
[Guest]: and you get you can get targeted but i think uh the uh important thing is to continue to engage uh

04:29:52.200 --> 04:29:59.400
[Guest]: rework strategies uh sometimes you need to rework strategies and uh rework issues but but to keep at

04:29:59.400 --> 04:30:04.840
[Guest]: it anyway and one of the uh historic kind of quotations that students of the law are always

04:30:04.840 --> 04:30:11.160
[Guest]: told is that the the law is really presently made by dissenting judgments not the majority judgment

04:30:11.160 --> 04:30:16.200
[Guest]: no that's interesting yeah so that is one of the things you're you're compelled to see

04:30:16.200 --> 04:30:21.480
[Guest]: study and read as students of the law the dissenting judgment yeah in asking my question

04:30:21.480 --> 04:30:25.560
[Amit Varma]: i wasn't really making an argument at all that one should not engage i think one has to do what

04:30:25.560 --> 04:30:32.360
[Amit Varma]: one has to do regardless of uh you know uh how uh optimistic we might be about it working out i mean

04:30:32.360 --> 04:30:38.520
[Amit Varma]: you know you you have to do what you have to do now i have sort of a question about

04:30:38.520 --> 04:30:47.000
[Amit Varma]: whether something has changed fundamentally in the last 20 years in terms of technology empowering

04:30:47.000 --> 04:30:52.760
[Amit Varma]: citizens like us like you pointed out at one point in your book that you know when zahira

04:30:52.760 --> 04:30:59.320
[Amit Varma]: sheikh turned hostile the in the best bakery case the reason that you guys were able to push through

04:30:59.320 --> 04:31:06.360
[Amit Varma]: is that you had footage shot i think by pankaj sharma um you had footage of her you know talking

04:31:06.360 --> 04:31:10.520
[Amit Varma]: about what had happened and therefore you know that helped that was evidenced by itself and

04:31:10.520 --> 04:31:17.640
[Amit Varma]: helped you make the case and today we are sort of living in an era where smartphones have become

04:31:17.640 --> 04:31:24.280
[Amit Varma]: ubiquitous broadband has become uh cheap a little bit of credit to your favorite uh neighborhood

04:31:24.280 --> 04:31:29.800
[Amit Varma]: industrialist mr ambani but be that as it may today you're not going to have a mass burial go

04:31:29.800 --> 04:31:35.560
[Amit Varma]: undocumented someone or the other you know the chances are just much greater that uh it will be

04:31:35.560 --> 04:31:41.000
[Amit Varma]: uh it will be documented that a lot else will be documented and therefore it is much harder to get

04:31:41.000 --> 04:31:48.040
[Amit Varma]: away with uh anything it is it is much harder for the unseen to remain unseen as it were is this

04:31:48.040 --> 04:31:55.400
[Amit Varma]: something that a you've seen playing out and b that it uh sort of gives you hope that you know

04:31:55.400 --> 04:32:00.280
[Amit Varma]: now you can't you know and there is no such thing as under the cover of night anymore

04:32:00.280 --> 04:32:06.360
[Guest]: uh see uh i am two or three levels of my answer again one is that you know during the zahira

04:32:06.360 --> 04:32:10.840
[Guest]: sheikh time it was not simply that pankaj sharma that was important i think important thing was

04:32:10.840 --> 04:32:15.000
[Guest]: that she herself had given previous statements to the national human rights commission signed

04:32:15.000 --> 04:32:19.560
[Guest]: affidavits to the nana vati commission where they were you know where the whole version had been laid

04:32:19.560 --> 04:32:24.760
[Guest]: out so her suddenly saying that all of this was not correct or was coerced out of me was could not

04:32:24.760 --> 04:32:29.560
[Guest]: hold out in a court of law and i went to the supreme court you know saying that her allegations

04:32:29.560 --> 04:32:33.640
[Guest]: are serious and please investigate which very few people know i said that when she made those

04:32:33.640 --> 04:32:37.880
[Guest]: allegations i said please investigate and that's when the supreme court set up a registrar uh

04:32:39.080 --> 04:32:44.280
[Guest]: general's inquiry we all appeared she had to appear and then that is that inquiry that found

04:32:44.280 --> 04:32:52.360
[Guest]: her guilty of perjury and all of that so but it's a arduous process to kind of counter all of that's

04:32:52.360 --> 04:32:56.040
[Guest]: right coming back to what i'd said earlier that once you engage in it there's a risk of this

04:32:56.040 --> 04:33:01.400
[Guest]: happening then it's an arduous process to then have correction and a lot of energy goes into that

04:33:01.400 --> 04:33:08.120
[Guest]: as much as fighting the actual battle besides that what i want to say that technology is it's

04:33:08.120 --> 04:33:15.560
[Guest]: it's not an apolitical beast okay so let's not completely glamorize it because i want to just

04:33:15.560 --> 04:33:21.160
[Guest]: flag five six very very problematic things that have happened with the same technology and not

04:33:21.160 --> 04:33:25.240
[Guest]: with the kind of result that you're yes certainly it's coming to the public gaze but it has not

04:33:25.240 --> 04:33:30.200
[Guest]: generated the kind of outrage that at least i would want and i'm sure you would want and one

04:33:30.200 --> 04:33:36.040
[Guest]: is this recent public flogging of muslim young men in kheda other one was a similar kind of incident

04:33:36.040 --> 04:33:41.880
[Guest]: in jharkhand which uh which where you had this horrendous killing and lynching and all of these

04:33:41.880 --> 04:33:47.720
[Guest]: are being captured on through technology by the perpetrators you know so they're not attempting

04:33:47.720 --> 04:33:52.520
[Guest]: to hide them they're actually wanting to play to the uh the support base that you were talking

04:33:52.520 --> 04:34:00.040
[Guest]: about to be able to galvanize more hysteria and hate uh in their corner so i think let's also flag

04:34:00.040 --> 04:34:05.240
[Guest]: that issue when you when you raise this question and having said that yes if if technology is truly

04:34:05.240 --> 04:34:09.880
[Guest]: democratized and has it been i don't think so i think it's not been democratized if you really

04:34:09.880 --> 04:34:16.680
[Guest]: look at how deep penetration internet is uh uh it's i think it's it's a patchy story i wouldn't

04:34:16.680 --> 04:34:22.680
[Guest]: say it's a negative story but it's a patchy story i mean even now there are a place in uttar pradesh

04:34:22.680 --> 04:34:28.440
[Guest]: including banaras and others where it's very bad internet penetration is very bad so you can't have

04:34:28.440 --> 04:34:32.600
[Guest]: zoom calls and conversations so it's i'm just saying that let's also be very clear that the

04:34:32.600 --> 04:34:39.560
[Guest]: penetration is very patchy i'm not uh and if somebody would like you were to map where india

04:34:39.560 --> 04:34:47.640
[Guest]: has really good broadband i think it might tell a different kind of story so yes it is possible

04:34:47.640 --> 04:34:52.680
[Guest]: and feasible today that there's going to be a huge god forbid a huge targeted violence tragedy or

04:34:52.680 --> 04:34:57.480
[Guest]: something happens that's either for the wrong reasons like i mentioned or for the right reasons

04:34:57.480 --> 04:35:03.000
[Guest]: it will get documented my question is again coming back to what i was thinking as a journalist what

04:35:03.000 --> 04:35:10.360
[Guest]: happens then does it generate the kind of response it ought to or should have from either the the

04:35:10.360 --> 04:35:16.360
[Guest]: institutions that i request required to correct it or from the political opposition that should

04:35:16.360 --> 04:35:22.360
[Guest]: take it up that also is not happening enough is what i feel because i mean just to give this take

04:35:22.360 --> 04:35:27.560
[Guest]: up this first example i gave of the flogging you just see that the two major parties in political

04:35:27.560 --> 04:35:31.720
[Guest]: opposition in gujarat who are now claiming that they might make some headway i don't know about

04:35:31.720 --> 04:35:37.320
[Guest]: winning that is congress and up have just not commented on that incident and i don't know what

04:35:37.320 --> 04:35:43.080
[Guest]: kind of message that sends to either the citizenry which is part of the community that of the

04:35:43.080 --> 04:35:47.960
[Guest]: policemen that perpetrated it or the survivor victims that have undergone such a humiliation

04:35:47.960 --> 04:35:54.760
[Guest]: what does it mean what is that what is that signaling mean i have not seen one of my one of my

04:35:55.640 --> 04:36:00.040
[Guest]: constructive criticisms for the higher judiciary which is high courts and supreme court is that

04:36:00.040 --> 04:36:06.200
[Guest]: they have a very interesting power called the suo moto which is that you can actually see some

04:36:06.200 --> 04:36:11.400
[Guest]: violations of fundamental rights taking place through the media through the social media and

04:36:11.400 --> 04:36:16.360
[Guest]: actually generate a legal action without it being brought to your notice and there have been

04:36:16.360 --> 04:36:20.760
[Guest]: occasions when the court has done that but those occasions are very rare i have not seen any

04:36:20.760 --> 04:36:28.040
[Guest]: constitutional courts be it in jharkhand or anywhere up or gujarat or anywhere actually

04:36:28.040 --> 04:36:35.080
[Guest]: initiate sumo to action on these kind of public violent humiliations and targeted violence against

04:36:35.080 --> 04:36:41.000
[Guest]: minorities for a long long time it didn't happen earlier didn't happen it's not even happen earlier

04:36:41.000 --> 04:36:47.080
[Guest]: even before so i don't i will not put the 2014 marker for that you know even it did not happen

04:36:47.080 --> 04:36:54.040
[Guest]: in nelly did not happen in 84 in fact i've had very very intense discussions with advocate hs

04:36:54.040 --> 04:37:00.840
[Guest]: fulka who's a one of the advocates who's really stuck by the sikh survivors of the 84 pogrom

04:37:00.840 --> 04:37:06.440
[Guest]: where the congress party was involved and he says that you know the kind of silence he encountered

04:37:06.440 --> 04:37:14.360
[Guest]: from the institutions was was was awful and in fact at least in gujarat we got a few glimmerings

04:37:14.360 --> 04:37:19.000
[Guest]: of hope with a couple of very good judgments from the supreme court transferring best bakery

04:37:19.000 --> 04:37:24.200
[Guest]: bilkis bano out of the state sending certain signals whereas they got nothing so you know i

04:37:24.200 --> 04:37:29.480
[Guest]: think some of these introspections are important and necessary as to when was it the national

04:37:29.480 --> 04:37:34.920
[Guest]: security narrative around mrs gandhi's killing uh that it was a sick body what was it that

04:37:34.920 --> 04:37:41.160
[Guest]: prevented uh the higher constitutional courts from intervening because it was delhi it was

04:37:41.160 --> 04:37:46.760
[Guest]: happening in delhi so you could not claim that you did not know every wretched resident of the

04:37:46.760 --> 04:37:52.600
[Guest]: capital would know judge or not a judge so why was that no there was no sumo to action i mean these

04:37:52.600 --> 04:37:57.400
[Guest]: are issues that need wider discussion and debate and i think some of this is also linked to the

04:37:57.400 --> 04:38:05.320
[Guest]: fact that we need to have sane sensible debates and conversations about institutions without

04:38:05.320 --> 04:38:10.040
[Guest]: hysterical responses or be or be threatened contempt of court or anything because i think

04:38:10.040 --> 04:38:15.800
[Guest]: you're not talking about crass motives sometimes what you're talking about is a general level of

04:38:16.680 --> 04:38:21.400
[Guest]: lack of accountability and i think that is something that citizens should start engaging

04:38:21.400 --> 04:38:27.800
[Guest]: in you know so whether it's a question of how higher courts deal with uh sexual assault or

04:38:27.800 --> 04:38:34.360
[Guest]: rape or in posco cases when you have a string of judgments suddenly it's not string but i've seen

04:38:34.360 --> 04:38:39.160
[Guest]: at least three or four saying that you know everything will be fine as long as the the

04:38:39.160 --> 04:38:44.520
[Guest]: perpetrator marries the victim i mean i just just the thought makes me cringe you know that is this

04:38:44.520 --> 04:38:49.640
[Guest]: a notion of substantive justice in the criminal law amendment by the way i have to point out i did

04:38:49.640 --> 04:38:56.440
[Amit Varma]: an episode with rukmini s who's written a great book on data journalism as well and what she found

04:38:56.440 --> 04:39:02.040
[Amit Varma]: out through her work was that a lot of these cases are actually cases where a couple elope

04:39:02.040 --> 04:39:07.880
[Amit Varma]: and then the girl's parents file a case and then it goes to the court and the judge's way out you

04:39:07.880 --> 04:39:12.840
[Guest]: so that you guys have to get married so but but is that the way out i mean even first of all in

04:39:12.840 --> 04:39:16.760
[Guest]: those cases it's fine but in one madhya pradesh case that was certainly not the case where there's

04:39:16.760 --> 04:39:21.160
[Guest]: a hierarchy and it'll be okay but my point is that even if that is the case is that the way

04:39:21.160 --> 04:39:25.400
[Guest]: the judiciary should have you should either deal with it head on and say that listen this is a

04:39:25.400 --> 04:39:31.880
[Guest]: marriage by choice yeah so therefore it's not no no see it's not rape it's consensual and therefore

04:39:31.880 --> 04:39:36.280
[Guest]: but you can't leave it halfway because you don't want to confront the parental authorities

04:39:36.280 --> 04:39:42.680
[Guest]: but anyway i'm i'm just mentioning that in any case you had this other very problematic judgment

04:39:42.680 --> 04:39:46.760
[Guest]: from the bombay high court saying that you know uh touch of a certain kind it doesn't

04:39:46.760 --> 04:39:50.680
[Guest]: does not constitute offense under posco so there could be any number of such or the feeble no

04:39:50.680 --> 04:39:55.880
[Guest]: judgment there's no end to these yeah so my point is any of these issues is not just about targeted

04:39:55.880 --> 04:40:02.520
[Guest]: violence against minorities any of these issues requires forums that sanely debate this in the

04:40:02.520 --> 04:40:09.320
[Guest]: in the public arena so that the echo chambers that judges live in also is not just of hysteria

04:40:09.320 --> 04:40:13.080
[Guest]: and the social media but where the sensible debates also get to them because i think they

04:40:13.080 --> 04:40:18.600
[Guest]: need to understand that the the citizenry is thinking about it talking about it how how the

04:40:18.600 --> 04:40:24.120
[Guest]: judiciary is being evaluated because this is in any mature democracy this is important

04:40:25.400 --> 04:40:30.920
[Guest]: a lot of power is wielded by different institutions of governance whether it's the police whether it's

04:40:30.920 --> 04:40:35.880
[Guest]: law enforcement whether it's the ib whether it's the judiciary so i think all these institutions

04:40:35.880 --> 04:40:42.280
[Guest]: should realize that debates and criticisms as long as they're healthy and not shrill and

04:40:43.320 --> 04:40:48.680
[Guest]: silly are needed to improve the the caliber and the quality of governance

04:40:49.800 --> 04:40:57.800
[Amit Varma]: i buy a cautionary note about technology and you know is there perhaps a shifting of the problem

04:40:57.800 --> 04:41:04.600
[Guest]: from nobody knows about this to nobody cares about this because almost and that's that comes

04:41:04.600 --> 04:41:09.400
[Guest]: back to your earlier question and a question that every sensible person asks are we just getting

04:41:09.400 --> 04:41:16.840
[Guest]: numbed by this kind of looking at these images and circulating them on whatsapp and not not

04:41:16.840 --> 04:41:21.480
[Guest]: reflecting on where they come from and what they mean but just quickly forwarding or not forwarding

04:41:21.480 --> 04:41:26.840
[Guest]: them or whatever it is you know what does this kind of relentless violence images mean imagery

04:41:26.840 --> 04:41:32.200
[Guest]: mean so i think it's it's really a question we need to grapple with because i will not as a

04:41:32.200 --> 04:41:37.480
[Guest]: journalist ever argue for any kind of censorship ever because i think that that could be much more

04:41:37.480 --> 04:41:43.080
[Guest]: harmful than anything else but but i think we need to ask where that is coming from how is it being

04:41:43.080 --> 04:41:49.240
[Guest]: how is it traveling who is who is allowing it to become viral you know all these terminologies that

04:41:49.240 --> 04:41:57.240
[Guest]: we are using and then we all know about the it cells working we know about all of the money behind

04:41:57.240 --> 04:42:03.640
[Guest]: this powering of the social media we know how elections are being now powered by data collection

04:42:03.640 --> 04:42:11.160
[Guest]: and so there's so many layers to this where i think you know just just sanitizing and seeing

04:42:11.160 --> 04:42:15.960
[Guest]: technologies empowering is not enough because just now the there's a huge power imbalance

04:42:15.960 --> 04:42:21.560
[Amit Varma]: huge power imbalance yeah i mean i mean the the the striking another striking image that i saw

04:42:21.560 --> 04:42:25.800
[Amit Varma]: earlier this week was and you must have seen it too was of this 14 year old girl who'd been raped

04:42:25.800 --> 04:42:30.280
[Amit Varma]: and she was lying bleeding on the ground and you have this picture of a bunch of men in front of

04:42:30.280 --> 04:42:35.640
[Amit Varma]: her not helping her but taking videos of her or pictures of her on their cell phones horrific image

04:42:35.640 --> 04:42:41.240
[Amit Varma]: thereby reducing her from a real person to an image on a phone which is like you know it's

04:42:41.240 --> 04:42:49.400
[Amit Varma]: it's horrific just losing your humanity here's a proposition i think i first uh you know presented

04:42:49.400 --> 04:42:56.920
[Amit Varma]: it to our car and i want to see what you think in my view you know uh in india we have three huge

04:42:56.920 --> 04:43:01.080
[Amit Varma]: problems and the first problem is approximate problem and you and i will agree on it and that's

04:43:01.080 --> 04:43:06.760
[Amit Varma]: a political problem of the particular dispensation in charge right but i think there are two deeper

04:43:06.760 --> 04:43:12.360
[Amit Varma]: and longer lasting problems which will remain with us and i'm i can't think of a way to solve them

04:43:12.360 --> 04:43:20.120
[Amit Varma]: one we have uh already uh spoken about which is the society that we are in that it's an illiberal

04:43:20.120 --> 04:43:26.600
[Amit Varma]: regressive society and more assertive now than it was earlier so what do we do about that that's one

04:43:26.600 --> 04:43:31.880
[Amit Varma]: and the other deeper problem is just the indian state which has always been an over-powerful

04:43:31.880 --> 04:43:38.680
[Amit Varma]: centralized predatory state where uh you know all the organs of the state become tools of the

04:43:38.680 --> 04:43:44.760
[Amit Varma]: political party in charge right so yeah there's a proximate problem and one hopes that something

04:43:44.760 --> 04:43:50.920
[Amit Varma]: emerges in our politics and we can get past this but those two deeper problems i don't know how we

04:43:50.920 --> 04:43:57.640
[Amit Varma]: get past because you can't just say that you know let us you know let's introduce ideas into the

04:43:57.640 --> 04:44:02.040
[Amit Varma]: discourse about how to make the state better and make it better and no that ain't gonna happen

04:44:02.040 --> 04:44:06.520
[Amit Varma]: because people you know the state will not let us change the state you know it is what it is

04:44:07.800 --> 04:44:15.000
[Amit Varma]: those in power are not going to give up power so what is sort of uh your sense in that do you also

04:44:15.000 --> 04:44:19.160
[Amit Varma]: you know do you agree with my broad formulation or is there something you'd like to add to these

04:44:19.160 --> 04:44:27.080
[Guest]: no i just like to uh nuance your second proposition um while not discounting the

04:44:27.080 --> 04:44:32.520
[Guest]: first and third at all which is yes the society today that is the kind of huge support echo

04:44:32.520 --> 04:44:37.480
[Guest]: chamber for this kind of political dispensation that is our problem i'll reiterate what i said

04:44:37.480 --> 04:44:43.160
[Guest]: right in the beginning i think is that you know what are the numbers are we talking about i mean

04:44:43.160 --> 04:44:49.240
[Guest]: where do we balance the numbers yes there is no question in my mind that a large section of our

04:44:49.240 --> 04:44:55.960
[Guest]: society has become the support chamber the support base for this kind of politics but i'm not still

04:44:55.960 --> 04:45:01.000
[Guest]: willing to believe that it has crossed 50 51 i mean that too on the very outside okay so that

04:45:01.000 --> 04:45:07.800
[Guest]: is the first thing the question is what about the rest are the rest and uncaring couldn't they couldn't

04:45:07.800 --> 04:45:13.960
[Guest]: care one way or the other are they scared are they scattered what is it that is what we need to

04:45:13.960 --> 04:45:19.640
[Guest]: figure out i don't have a uh pat answer for that i think it's some of all these three that they are

04:45:19.640 --> 04:45:24.680
[Guest]: uncaring some of them but i think a lot a lot of them are also scared and many of them are scattered

04:45:24.680 --> 04:45:28.360
[Guest]: so the question is the scattered and the scared what do you do with that how do you work with that

04:45:28.360 --> 04:45:35.720
[Guest]: etc so that's that's the first thing i just like to first drop in the in my response secondly i

04:45:35.720 --> 04:45:41.560
[Guest]: think i don't think one can hope and this thing hope any that hope for the state to improve and

04:45:41.560 --> 04:45:47.480
[Guest]: all of that no but i think if one accepts the fact that at the moment the structure exists

04:45:48.520 --> 04:45:54.920
[Guest]: and the fact is that for whatever reason we are a notional or real not so real democracy

04:45:56.600 --> 04:46:02.120
[Guest]: then do we or do we not speak and i'm asking you this question back do we do we or do we not speak

04:46:02.120 --> 04:46:07.800
[Guest]: about things like uh eventually you have the preamble which makes the people sovereign not

04:46:07.800 --> 04:46:12.840
[Guest]: the state and therefore every decision of parliament every decision of the supreme court

04:46:12.840 --> 04:46:18.280
[Guest]: every decision of the election commission that is constitutional bodies is eventually answerable to

04:46:18.280 --> 04:46:25.880
[Guest]: the people at some level obviously in an organized fashion so how do this mass of people become

04:46:25.880 --> 04:46:30.760
[Guest]: articulate enough to be able to challenge anything that they find so different wings of the state if

04:46:30.760 --> 04:46:35.320
[Guest]: you desegregate because it's too overwhelming otherwise how do you desegregate and actually

04:46:35.320 --> 04:46:40.600
[Guest]: start challenging this and can you do it at all that's the question so can you really realistically

04:46:40.600 --> 04:46:45.720
[Guest]: talk about judicial reform is it ever going to happen or no our is the appointment of judges

04:46:45.720 --> 04:46:50.600
[Guest]: the diversity of judges never really going to change okay those are the questions i think we

04:46:50.600 --> 04:46:55.800
[Guest]: need to keep raising okay and i think in the raising of the questions you will maybe get some

04:46:55.800 --> 04:47:01.080
[Guest]: answers there cannot be one person or three people giving you the pat answer one of the major reasons

04:47:01.080 --> 04:47:05.720
[Guest]: and this was stated by i think by mr sybil the other day when he was being a couple civil when

04:47:05.720 --> 04:47:10.680
[Guest]: he was being felicitated for 50 years at the bar is that you know what you need today is a lawyer's

04:47:11.480 --> 04:47:20.760
[Guest]: movement for social justice to counter uh the kind of uh silence that is there from the bar today

04:47:20.760 --> 04:47:25.800
[Guest]: when there's according to him wrongs done by sections of the judiciary so you know this could

04:47:25.800 --> 04:47:31.160
[Guest]: be one answer i don't know but the point is i know from a fact from my father father and grandfather

04:47:31.160 --> 04:47:35.640
[Guest]: and great-grandfather and everything that they've experienced from their writings that the bar and

04:47:35.640 --> 04:47:42.520
[Guest]: the bench are intrinsically linked okay when you say bar is the not the that bar but the bar which

04:47:42.520 --> 04:47:49.080
[Guest]: is the advocacy advocates so if the bar becomes supine like it did during the emergency except

04:47:49.080 --> 04:47:55.720
[Guest]: a few outstanding voices then the judiciary also will just have one dissenting hr khanna okay

04:47:56.360 --> 04:48:04.680
[Guest]: but i remember that that year in 1973 when the super session took place uh kc college

04:48:06.120 --> 04:48:11.080
[Guest]: june i mean an amazing meeting takes place i still have the booklet from that meeting

04:48:11.080 --> 04:48:15.160
[Guest]: where you who did you have you had daftari you had hidayatullah you had

04:48:15.160 --> 04:48:22.680
[Guest]: uh setelvar you had kt shah nani palkhiwala all of them speaking about on the outrageous

04:48:22.680 --> 04:48:28.680
[Guest]: act of the government and superseding and making ray the chief justice so you know there will be

04:48:28.680 --> 04:48:33.720
[Guest]: those moments now was that unimportant was that dissent not important i think we the fact that

04:48:33.720 --> 04:48:38.840
[Guest]: we are referring it to it today in a conversation means that those dissents become very very

04:48:38.840 --> 04:48:45.400
[Guest]: important to the growth of a democracy do i see that dissent today from the bar no which is why

04:48:45.400 --> 04:48:50.120
[Guest]: leads someone like mr kapil sibal to make that statement it's coming it's coming from other

04:48:50.120 --> 04:48:56.200
[Guest]: sections of the lawyers and advocates who are not the big big names but it's coming from dogged

04:48:56.200 --> 04:49:05.720
[Guest]: practitioners who are working you know on the most difficult of cases so uh the issue is how do we

04:49:05.720 --> 04:49:16.600
[Guest]: then tackle this all this indian state as you put it do we just give up on tackling on it or do we

04:49:16.600 --> 04:49:22.200
[Guest]: try and maybe think of ways to segregate the different wings of it and think of talking about

04:49:22.200 --> 04:49:26.760
[Guest]: chipping away and challenging i mean the way the election commission has started behaving is

04:49:26.760 --> 04:49:32.040
[Guest]: outrageous it's been written about it's been talked about one or two previous election commissioners

04:49:32.040 --> 04:49:36.840
[Guest]: are somewhat writing about it but that's not enough i mean they have to be able to understand

04:49:36.840 --> 04:49:41.880
[Guest]: that the voters at some point is eventually whom they are responsible to not the government of the

04:49:41.880 --> 04:49:48.280
[Guest]: day but when will those voters get mobilized outside an adr association of democratic reforms

04:49:48.280 --> 04:49:54.360
[Guest]: to challenge the election commission that becomes the question of people's mobilization resistance

04:49:54.360 --> 04:50:00.760
[Guest]: etc it's a very tough call because it means organizing it means organizing non-violently

04:50:00.760 --> 04:50:08.120
[Guest]: in a cohesive way in an informed way communicating this challenge you know all of this means working

04:50:08.120 --> 04:50:13.640
[Guest]: on electoral reform judicial reform structural reform criminal justice reform i mean what was

04:50:13.640 --> 04:50:17.880
[Guest]: my lessons that what was the lesson that we learned after the best bakery case was that

04:50:17.880 --> 04:50:24.920
[Guest]: four things are necessary in our criminal justice system first is independence of investigation

04:50:24.920 --> 04:50:28.920
[Guest]: which is police reform which nine police commissions have told us we should do but

04:50:28.920 --> 04:50:34.520
[Guest]: nobody wants to do but it's not a citizen's issue it's not an election issue how do we make it that

04:50:34.520 --> 04:50:37.240
[Guest]: okay then the question of independence of prosecution

04:50:39.560 --> 04:50:44.840
[Guest]: because only i think two or three states in the country have the judiciary appointing the

04:50:44.840 --> 04:50:48.200
[Guest]: prosecutors otherwise it's the government appointing the prosecutor so again you have a

04:50:49.000 --> 04:50:54.760
[Guest]: collusion when the cases are argued then witness protection which again came to the fore with the

04:50:54.760 --> 04:51:00.280
[Guest]: Zahira Sheikh case and finally time-bound trials you can't have criminal trials going on for 10 11

04:51:00.280 --> 04:51:05.560
[Guest]: no survivor will have the will have the stamina to even want to live through that tragedy for 12

04:51:05.560 --> 04:51:10.840
[Guest]: why should he or she you want to wrap up and move on right so two or three years time-bound trials

04:51:10.840 --> 04:51:15.640
[Guest]: now these are very simple things it's not rocket science that i'm sharing with you but who is going

04:51:15.640 --> 04:51:19.880
[Guest]: to push it which band of citizens is going to push which political party to make this into an issue

04:51:19.880 --> 04:51:24.360
[Guest]: i mean it's it's really not an easy call but the question is whether it needs to be taken or not

04:51:25.240 --> 04:51:31.240
[Amit Varma]: yeah no i feel that even if i believe that the cause was hopeless we'd still have to do what we

04:51:31.240 --> 04:51:36.280
[Amit Varma]: have to do because we don't do what we do for instrumental reasons if it's the right thing to do

04:51:36.280 --> 04:51:41.800
[Amit Varma]: you do it and that's clearly what motivates you as well there's a lot of stuff we can't talk about

04:51:41.800 --> 04:51:50.040
[Amit Varma]: you know because it's sub judice but what was what was your feeling like when you were you know

04:51:50.040 --> 04:51:54.440
[Guest]: incarcerated recently i won't talk about like i said the case and everything i will i just simply

04:51:54.440 --> 04:51:59.160
[Guest]: say that the manner in which it happened was outrageous and completely unlawful the way i was

04:51:59.160 --> 04:52:03.720
[Guest]: done but in jail it was it's i mean nothing can be worse than being jailed because your

04:52:03.720 --> 04:52:08.360
[Guest]: personal freedom is taken away you feel helpless you feel despairing you feel angry

04:52:08.360 --> 04:52:13.880
[Guest]: you feel let down there's also physical discomfort which you're not used to all of that is there

04:52:14.680 --> 04:52:19.240
[Guest]: i think eventually human beings have this ability to dig deep into their reserves and

04:52:19.800 --> 04:52:26.200
[Guest]: deal with it and we we all did i i did uh you you build relationships with people women other women

04:52:26.200 --> 04:52:31.560
[Guest]: inmates in the barrack you you have conversations some of those relationships become very very long

04:52:31.560 --> 04:52:39.560
[Guest]: very very long standing uh the the most difficult thing is to cut time is to kind of uh is how do

04:52:39.560 --> 04:52:44.200
[Guest]: you cut time and i used to find the greatest solace in writing and reading i wrote a lot

04:52:44.200 --> 04:52:49.720
[Guest]: two three thousand words a day handwritten in my diaries what would you write about it's a book

04:52:49.720 --> 04:52:54.040
[Guest]: hopefully that'll come out it was basically about everything that i thought i felt my observations

04:52:54.040 --> 04:52:59.480
[Guest]: how the political economy of the jail worked on the hard labor of 2025 convicted women

04:52:59.480 --> 04:53:04.920
[Guest]: who would be working from 7 a.m to 7 p.m just at three thousand rupees a day you know stuff you

04:53:04.920 --> 04:53:10.440
[Guest]: try and find out because the journalist in you is always there stories for individual uh women

04:53:11.080 --> 04:53:17.160
[Guest]: under trials and convicts i've written written noted a lot of those stories how to cut the time

04:53:17.160 --> 04:53:20.920
[Guest]: then you read and write books and after six o'clock nobody wants the lights on 6 30 so the

04:53:20.920 --> 04:53:26.760
[Guest]: bank gets very dark there's a very banal hindi film channel going on with the worst kind of films

04:53:26.760 --> 04:53:30.520
[Guest]: so all of that is very tough it's very tough sleep is difficult sometimes

04:53:32.040 --> 04:53:37.320
[Guest]: but you manage you manage somehow somehow you find hope in small silly little things

04:53:38.040 --> 04:53:43.160
[Guest]: gardening the flowers there's a peacock bird somewhere they're birds i mean this this is the

04:53:43.160 --> 04:53:47.880
[Guest]: kind of thing human beings start looking for and i like i said to you sometime in between that the

04:53:47.880 --> 04:53:52.760
[Guest]: greatest sucker to me was of course i was lucky enough that my family visited me for the letters

04:53:52.760 --> 04:53:57.560
[Guest]: i mean the letters were just unimaginably a huge hope and that's what i keep telling friends after

04:53:57.560 --> 04:54:02.520
[Guest]: coming out and organizations and groups that we should ensure that all political prisoners get

04:54:02.520 --> 04:54:09.720
[Guest]: letters we should just ensure that we sit down and write to them because that's that that that does

04:54:09.720 --> 04:54:14.360
[Guest]: help you know my my huge battle with the jail authorities would be to keep the library open

04:54:14.360 --> 04:54:19.560
[Guest]: because they have a very nice reading room in sabarmati mahila jail but they don't keep it

04:54:19.560 --> 04:54:23.080
[Guest]: open enough they keep it open for two hours sometimes one hour sometimes sometimes keep it

04:54:23.080 --> 04:54:27.880
[Guest]: shut they just believe it's not a priority for women you know and though there will always be

04:54:27.880 --> 04:54:32.760
[Guest]: two or three women who want to sit there and read and write but it's a battle so those are the kind

04:54:32.760 --> 04:54:37.720
[Guest]: of battles one had to fight initially i was very scared too because i was worried about my physical

04:54:37.720 --> 04:54:43.880
[Guest]: security and all of that but then i just sort of told myself that it's best to be living in a

04:54:43.880 --> 04:54:49.320
[Guest]: barrack with other women and my greatest security lie lay in being with other women and i was

04:54:49.320 --> 04:54:55.080
[Amit Varma]: with other women and that was okay and was there the fear that this could last a long time like

04:54:55.080 --> 04:55:00.600
[Amit Varma]: you've seen siddique kapan in jail for so long umar khalid was there a fear that oh my god like

04:55:00.600 --> 04:55:05.560
[Guest]: i'm going in going in i don't know when i will come out that's what the state wants okay that

04:55:05.560 --> 04:55:12.040
[Guest]: the state wants that and unfortunately there's not enough accountability in the bail courts and

04:55:12.040 --> 04:55:16.760
[Guest]: the judicial system to ensure that doesn't happen to others so there's always that fear that it

04:55:16.760 --> 04:55:21.720
[Amit Varma]: could have lasted much longer than it did were you you know you've seen the stick but were you

04:55:21.720 --> 04:55:25.800
[Amit Varma]: ever shown a carrot were you ever kind of was there ever a hint that why don't you chill and

04:55:25.800 --> 04:55:31.400
[Guest]: stop and things will get better or whatever i got a lot of indirect hints over the last 20 years i

04:55:31.400 --> 04:55:36.200
[Guest]: mean it was through persons had not name and mention but there would be indirect in that you've

04:55:36.200 --> 04:55:43.480
[Guest]: gone far enough now you've got one case transferred and now you've got one person arrested now enough

04:55:43.480 --> 04:55:48.280
[Guest]: now you leave the cases now that is not necessary but you realize you're accountable to a wider

04:55:48.280 --> 04:55:55.640
[Amit Varma]: survivor population it's not just about you and and that kind of keeps you going um so two final

04:55:55.640 --> 04:56:00.680
[Amit Varma]: questions i've taken a lot of your time and my penultimate question is sort of a traditional

04:56:00.680 --> 04:56:06.920
[Amit Varma]: question for all my guests who come on the show that recommend for me and my listeners books films

04:56:06.920 --> 04:56:11.560
[Amit Varma]: music whatever gives you joy whatever you like so much that you'd just like to share it with everyone

04:56:11.560 --> 04:56:17.640
[Guest]: oh i must mention that i just love thrillers thrillers of all kinds so i read lots of them

04:56:17.640 --> 04:56:22.120
[Guest]: when i was in jail also so um read lots of thrillers i think they can keep you going

04:56:22.120 --> 04:56:27.720
[Guest]: they're lighter reading for me that's just for a lighter moment many authors but i remember that

04:56:29.160 --> 04:56:36.520
[Guest]: i think norman burke's the scalpel the sword it was a very lovely book about this uh i think it

04:56:36.520 --> 04:56:41.560
[Guest]: i think it was this surgeon who went from the spanish civil war a very important book that i

04:56:41.560 --> 04:56:49.240
[Guest]: read when i was growing up then of course there is uh eduardo galeano the eugen writers outstanding

04:56:49.240 --> 04:56:56.360
[Guest]: oran pamuk is very very good and i mean i keep going back to the framing of the indian constitution

04:56:56.360 --> 04:57:02.920
[Guest]: which sounds very uh trite but it's shiva rao b shiva rao and it basically encompasses the

04:57:02.920 --> 04:57:09.320
[Guest]: uh the constituent assembly debates thematically of course i've also got the 18 valium constitution

04:57:09.320 --> 04:57:16.280
[Guest]: assembly debates where i go through the sections on preamble and article 14 article 19 and i

04:57:16.280 --> 04:57:21.320
[Guest]: realized now they're all online and i think it's very important that some of us were interested

04:57:21.320 --> 04:57:28.040
[Guest]: and particularly young people who are concerned about how fragile indian society's commitment to

04:57:28.040 --> 04:57:33.480
[Guest]: to equality and secularism is that we go through these debates because you realize the white

04:57:33.480 --> 04:57:40.520
[Guest]: consensus there was around the fact that in spite and despite of partition we should remain a

04:57:41.560 --> 04:57:47.080
[Guest]: republican constitutional democracy and i think that was an amazingly brave and sagacious decision

04:57:47.080 --> 04:57:52.920
[Guest]: of our founding mothers and fathers and i don't think it just came out of an elite club it came

04:57:52.920 --> 04:57:59.400
[Guest]: out from a grounded movement and realization of adivasis agriculturist workers all sections of

04:57:59.400 --> 04:58:05.320
[Guest]: the indian people who said that no this is the only way india can survive we are so diverse we

04:58:05.320 --> 04:58:12.360
[Guest]: are so different we are so our language our culture our religion our i mean we're so inegalitarian

04:58:12.360 --> 04:58:17.160
[Guest]: some are rich few are very rich the rest but the only way you can do it by at least giving a vision

04:58:17.160 --> 04:58:23.560
[Guest]: of equality so i think go back to our constitution debates i think it's important it's not boring at

04:58:23.560 --> 04:58:27.560
[Amit Varma]: all and to add a book to that if i may i would recommend this book i don't know if you've heard

04:58:27.560 --> 04:58:32.920
[Amit Varma]: of it called foot soldiers of the constitution yeah a lovely book i would have loved to discuss

04:58:32.920 --> 04:58:39.320
[Amit Varma]: you know um just 2002 and the aftermath for a few more hours but people can read the book it's it's

04:58:39.320 --> 04:58:45.720
[Amit Varma]: it's uh are you opening any films or music oh lots of films and music but i mean i simply love

04:58:45.720 --> 04:58:52.520
[Guest]: i mean i simply love indian classical music i love jazz i am miles davis i like janice choplin

04:58:53.800 --> 04:59:00.040
[Guest]: and of course beatles are my all-time favorite bob dylan and if you come to indian classical i mean

04:59:00.040 --> 04:59:08.120
[Guest]: there's very little i don't like but malik arjun mansur and bhim sen joshi and i also likes many

04:59:08.120 --> 04:59:12.920
[Guest]: times to just listen to music late evening i also like western classical very much i don't know it

04:59:12.920 --> 04:59:20.680
[Guest]: very well but i i love listening to western classical music uh two and films all of them

04:59:20.680 --> 04:59:26.440
[Guest]: i mean satyajit ray of course and uh igmar bergman all of them and of course i like i mean charlie

04:59:26.440 --> 04:59:30.920
[Guest]: chaplin is a go-to for me all the time even again and again and again many many times

04:59:31.800 --> 04:59:37.960
[Amit Varma]: and my final question if people listening to this want to help in some way whether by volunteering

04:59:37.960 --> 04:59:43.960
[Amit Varma]: whether by contributing just in whatever way how can they reach you what can they do

04:59:45.320 --> 04:59:51.000
[Guest]: see actually that's such an important question for us because you know thanks to all the various

04:59:51.000 --> 04:59:56.280
[Guest]: kinds of targeting we've gone through we are an organization that proudly today functions on

04:59:56.280 --> 05:00:02.360
[Guest]: entirely indian funds so our website cjp.org.in tells everybody where how to contribute the

05:00:02.360 --> 05:00:07.560
[Guest]: smallest amount is important the larger amount is also welcome so of course the donations are

05:00:07.560 --> 05:00:13.080
[Guest]: very very welcome and there's a very easy way to do it online and even otherwise the other way is

05:00:13.080 --> 05:00:18.920
[Guest]: which is what i also tell young people is you know you can intern with us you can volunteer

05:00:18.920 --> 05:00:24.760
[Guest]: legal research and writing narratives we've had interns from universities worldwide who've

05:00:24.760 --> 05:00:30.120
[Guest]: interned with us writing about comparative kinds of targeted violence black violence in chicago

05:00:30.120 --> 05:00:34.840
[Guest]: how police have behaved there compared to gujarat very outstanding work so that that's what you

05:00:34.840 --> 05:00:39.240
[Guest]: prefer you can write to us for internships you want to write we have some of the top universities

05:00:39.240 --> 05:00:46.360
[Guest]: sending legal interns to us even now and we get them we get about 15 to 25 interns number i can

05:00:46.360 --> 05:00:53.000
[Guest]: handle because sometimes our team is small and that we we are looking for video volunteer people

05:00:53.000 --> 05:00:57.960
