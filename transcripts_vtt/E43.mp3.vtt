00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:53.920
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. Most of the episodes of this podcast have been

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.320
[Amit Varma]: about economics or politics, about public policy in other words. But even private actions

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.280
[Amit Varma]: have seen and unseen effects. In today's episode, I want to examine the seen and unseen

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.280
[Amit Varma]: effects of parenting or parenthood. My guest today on the show is Natasha Badwar. Natasha

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.960
[Amit Varma]: is a columnist, filmmaker, entrepreneur, but is best known for her remarkable column on

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.560
[Amit Varma]: parenting that has appeared every week in Mint for the last six years. Now, I hate kids

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.320
[Amit Varma]: and have no interest in parenting, but week on week, I find her column insightful and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.240
[Amit Varma]: deeply moving for what it reveals about being human. She doesn't look at parenthood or herself

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.840
[Amit Varma]: through a glossy filter, but with unflinching honesty, and that relentless week on week

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.880
[Amit Varma]: self-awareness and self-examination contains many deep and unique insights. Natasha has

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.000
[Amit Varma]: recently released a book, My Daughter's Mum, and I strongly recommend it to all my listeners.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.800
[Amit Varma]: I caught up with her recently to chat about what she has learnt about parenthood in all

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.800
[Amit Varma]: these years of writing about it.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.560
[Guest]: Natasha, welcome to the show.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.040
[Guest]: Hello, I'm really happy to be on this show.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.080
[Amit Varma]: Natasha, I'm not normally an audience for parenting columns. In fact, I'm a determined

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.560
[Unknown]: non parent and I don't like kids.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.040
[Unknown]: I'm not an audience for parenting columns either.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. However, I've been reading your column with great interest for the six plus years

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.720
[Amit Varma]: that you've been writing it. And partly because I feel what they do is in a very gentle, sensitive

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.660
[Amit Varma]: way reveal human nature. It's not just about children or parenting, but it's about looking

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.880
[Amit Varma]: deeper at people and things that we take for granted. Now, in today's episode, I'd like

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.080
[Amit Varma]: to sort of talk about the seen and unseen effects of parenting. Now, we all know the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.680
[Amit Varma]: scene effects that the scene effects on the positive side is that it's fulfilling. You

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.560
[Amit Varma]: have your own flesh and blood and you watch them grow. They look after you in your old

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.800
[Amit Varma]: age. If you run out of food, you can eat them. And on the negative side, they disrupt your

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.240
[Amit Varma]: life completely. Women especially often have to give up their careers or their independent

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.520
[Amit Varma]: dreams to have their kid. And essentially, the life that you live is completely different

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.560
[Amit Varma]: from what it would have been without the kids. And many people become parents before they're

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.520
[Amit Varma]: ready for it. These are sort of cliched tropes, you know, which many have gone over. And I

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:18.440
[Amit Varma]: enjoy it. I enjoy your column and your book so much because it looks at everyday happinesses

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.160
[Amit Varma]: and sorrows, which are not sort of from that playbook. And you get the sense in all your

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:32.320
[Amit Varma]: writing that by watching your children grow up with such attention, you are also growing

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.080
[Amit Varma]: up yourself and becoming a different person and discovering yourself. So can you tell

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.080
[Amit Varma]: me a little bit more about what writing about this has done to you?

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:51.920
[Unknown]: Okay, so you've said it all. You've spoken for me. I'm going to just record this and

00:03:51.920 --> 00:04:01.040
[Unknown]: use it in one of my columns. But yeah, you're right. It's growing up with the children is

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.600
[Guest]: a process of growing up. And it's not always a voluntary process of growing up. It kind

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:19.160
[Guest]: of jolts you out of your, you know, your notions of normalcy, your notions of what is right

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.000
[Guest]: and what is wrong, what is a decent way of living. And I didn't expect this. I agree

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.360
[Guest]: with you that a lot of people have children before they're ready for it. And I also agree

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.560
[Guest]: with you that we shouldn't have children unless we really, really desperately want to have

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:44.680
[Guest]: them. But I, you know, I was 31 when I was 32, when my first child was born, and I'd

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.080
[Guest]: always wanted to be a parent. So for me, whether I was going to have a biological child or

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.080
[Guest]: not, I, you know, I'd been ready to adopt a child. And I'd been kind of looking at adoption.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.440
[Guest]: So I was one person who really felt that she was ready to be a parent. And the first couple

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:10.520
[Guest]: of years were fairly, you know, simple. The only things that I had to battle against were

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.000
[Guest]: the stereotypes that others were thrusting upon me. But as soon as my daughter was old

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.720
[Guest]: enough to go to school, you know, as soon as she was ready to start speaking her mind,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.400
[Guest]: expressing herself, and as soon as we had two children, and we had to deal with the

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.840
[Guest]: dynamic of the first one suddenly discovering that she's not the center of the universe,

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.440
[Guest]: me discovering that I do not have enough hands, you know, one that is at work on the smartphone,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.080
[Guest]: the other that is holding the baby, the head that is paying attention to the husband, and,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.080
[Guest]: you know, now I had a new baby, and I was besotted with the new baby. So I didn't have

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:55.640
[Guest]: any time for anyone else. So, you know, from there started a process where I have literally

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.280
[Guest]: discovered that every day, you are forced to learn something new, that every now and

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:10.120
[Guest]: then, you forget the lessons that you have learned yesterday. For example, just then

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.960
[Guest]: in the last two months, our middle child, she's 12. And she's, you know, she's she's

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.200
[Guest]: going through what everyone would call a phase, she'll get over it, you know, nevermind, don't

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:28.320
[Guest]: don't take it too seriously. But she's angsting over something she's not at peace with the

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:35.840
[Guest]: world with the family with herself. And, and I discovered that because I have been writing

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.360
[Guest]: about because I have because I have the column and I am, you know, a deadline bound to write

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:48.480
[Guest]: every week about what's going on in my life. I discovered that she was actually going through

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.520
[Guest]: the same phase when she was three years old, and then the same phase when she was seven

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:59.080
[Guest]: years old, that when I describe how she was behaving, or how I felt she was feeling at

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.520
[Guest]: that age of three, and at that age of seven, and now at the age of 12, the words were exactly

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:11.840
[Guest]: the same. And I would not have made that connection. If I hadn't actually written about it, I didn't

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.160
[Guest]: even remember that I had written about it, I just chanced upon the same thing, which

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.080
[Guest]: also goes to show that, you know, you deal with a situation and you and you forget about

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:28.640
[Guest]: it, you don't make the connections. And somewhere I feel that popular culture, popular parenting

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.600
[Guest]: culture, family culture, doesn't want you to make the connections. Because when you

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:44.040
[Guest]: do, you then begin to question the entire structure of the family, the hierarchy within

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:50.280
[Guest]: the family, not only the nuclear family, but also the extended family, you then have to

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:56.560
[Guest]: question the structure of our education system. You may have chosen as a parent, the finest

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.480
[Guest]: school in the city, and you know, you think your job is done. Yeah, now I have put together

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:08.400
[Guest]: the finances and I have used my influence and I have charmed the principal into accepting

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:16.400
[Guest]: my children and look what I've done for my child. And your child comes back home in despair.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.080
[Guest]: And you don't know what is it? Is it something that I didn't do right? Because that's always

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.400
[Guest]: your first thought as a parent? Is it something that's happening in the school, you go and

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.760
[Guest]: have a conversation with the school and they're listening to you, they're empathetic, but

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:39.080
[Guest]: they don't have a solution. And the child is too young, too confused, too isolated as

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:46.680
[Guest]: an individual to be able to articulate what is it that is getting to her. And you realize

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:53.960
[Guest]: that, you know, what is supposed to make you happy doesn't always make you happy. You can

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.880
[Guest]: offer her the finest dance class and, you know, take her for football and buy her the

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:07.960
[Guest]: best kit and give her the best coach. But not enough has changed in society. Our notions

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:14.640
[Guest]: of gender, our notions of authority, you must, you know, if your coach says so, he's right,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:20.320
[Guest]: you must listen to it. You haven't questioned your own relationship with each other as parents.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.360
[Guest]: You know, you're very together. You may be you may have read the same, you know, books

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.960
[Guest]: and had the same influences. And, you know, you feel that, OK, you've got this liberal

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.240
[Guest]: minded guy and you want the same kind of future for your child. You want the same kind of

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:42.600
[Guest]: values in your child. But but you're kind of repeating a script between yourselves where

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:48.160
[Guest]: he can get angry and you will cry in the corner every time you have an argument. And your

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:55.000
[Guest]: child, like every other child in the history of mankind, is witnessing the same kind of

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.160
[Guest]: dynamics between the gender and finding it not just because children can see that. Children,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.800
[Guest]: children, you know, they respond to their feelings. Still, we have actually wiped out

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:13.840
[Guest]: the ability to do that. And somewhere in popular culture, we are always telling parents, don't

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:21.480
[Guest]: take them too seriously. Which you feel is a mistake, which is an absolute mistake, because

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.920
[Guest]: you're also being told as a new parent, you don't know what is happening. Let me tell

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:32.120
[Guest]: you what is happening. And, you know, you know, you know, because you're so deeply connected

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.560
[Guest]: with that new baby. And sometimes you don't know, but you do know that what is being told

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:46.120
[Guest]: to you is not exactly what you are feeling. So you struggle as a parent to name experiences,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:53.960
[Guest]: to name feelings that have not been expressed either in other people's writing or in everyday

00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:00.680
[Guest]: conversations. And like you said, you know, it's not only that you you find that you don't

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:06.240
[Guest]: have a language to accurately represent what is hurting you and what is confusing you.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:12.600
[Guest]: You also don't have one to accurately represent the highs, the happinesses, you know, those

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.560
[Amit Varma]: little moments that make it worthwhile.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.920
[Amit Varma]: Because since you were writing a weekly column, and every week you had a deadline and you

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:25.520
[Amit Varma]: had to put a column out there on parenting, was that heightened awareness of what your

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.800
[Amit Varma]: child is doing and how you're interacting with them and it heightened self awareness,

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:36.400
[Amit Varma]: something that either helped or hurt you in different ways in the actual job of parenting?

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:46.480
[Guest]: Yeah. So, you know, when I, I had begun to write about everyday moments on my social

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:54.400
[Guest]: media, I had begun to blog about it anonymously. Because what went on my blog was something

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.440
[Guest]: that I was still trying to figure out. I didn't want anyone else to tell me how to feel about

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.720
[Guest]: it. So that was a space that I protected. Then if I felt that it was something that,

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.880
[Guest]: you know, was entertainment or entertaining, or, you know, it had some humor, or it, I

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:19.000
[Guest]: would share it on Facebook, you know, just tentatively within my own circle of friends.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.120
[Guest]: And if Facebook said, Why are you thinking like this? Don't feel like this? What's really

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.680
[Guest]: going on? I'd say, Hey, wait, wait, wait, you're not being a good listener. I would

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:36.680
[Guest]: take it to Twitter. So even before the column was commissioned, I was writing in three different

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.640
[Guest]: spaces. And you know, I had a hierarchy completely private for an audience on Twitter that didn't

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.520
[Guest]: know me at all. So I could ignore them if I wanted to. And they could accept me if they

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.760
[Guest]: wanted to and for a circle of friends on Facebook, when the column got commissioned, and I had

00:12:52.760 --> 00:13:00.480
[Guest]: been hoping to, to write formally for a larger platform. I actually sat down and cried. I

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.520
[Guest]: was like, Oh, my God, this is the end of my life, because now I'm going to have to be

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:16.640
[Guest]: a good parent. Because it's not worth writing anything unless it's honest. And if I'm not

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.640
[Unknown]: going to do a good job, it's going to be really hard to put it out there.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.400
[Guest]: Did it change your parenting, the self awareness?

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:33.160
[Guest]: I think in the long run, it changed us in the sense that we all through the words that

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:44.040
[Guest]: got written, learned to listen to each other better. And what I discovered when I began

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:50.800
[Guest]: to write about is, was that what I was really struggling to make a breakthrough in was my

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:57.040
[Guest]: relationship with my own parents. Because you realize that you cannot cut through the

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:03.280
[Guest]: bushes and charter a path for your family with your children, till you have also gone

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:09.280
[Guest]: back and figured out where you're coming from. And what is it that influences you? Why are

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:15.360
[Guest]: some things easier and something so hard for you to do? And it makes you think something

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:23.200
[Guest]: happened that I have forgotten, or that I have, that has made me very angry about something.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.240
[Guest]: So you know, if the if the water ran out in the house, I would go into a panic. And my

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.880
[Guest]: husband would be like, it's just water, it will come back. And it made me connect to

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.560
[Guest]: a memory when my mother would panic when the water would run out, you know, ages ago. And

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.400
[Guest]: at that time, if it ran out, and we were on the fourth floor, it would not come for a

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.320
[Guest]: couple of days, but I was in the you know, new millennium, and it would come in a couple

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:55.000
[Guest]: of hours. But I had inherited a kind of, you know, a fear. And, and I mean, that's a really

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.200
[Guest]: small example. But there are many other things where you find that there are emotional blocks

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.080
[Guest]: that there are some things that just trigger you. Some things come really easily to you.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.480
[Guest]: You buy them a certain kind of shoe, you dress them up in a certain kind of way. And it doesn't

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:15.920
[Guest]: quite fit with the times or with the trends. And it takes you back into your childhood.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:27.280
[Guest]: So how it changed us was really when I began to write, how I understood them, they began

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:36.640
[Guest]: to understand how I was trying to understand them. And somewhere the words helped us misunderstand

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:43.520
[Guest]: each other less. Because I think that really is the, you know, is the roadblock in all

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:50.240
[Unknown]: intimate relationships. Because at some point, you know, you have just piled up the misunderstandings

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.960
[Amit Varma]: and you don't know. And often what happens in relationships, whether they're marital

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.920
[Amit Varma]: relationships or parental relationships is that you just have two parties talking past

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.840
[Guest]: each other. Yeah. But in this case, I guess you're paying more close attention.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:09.120
[Guest]: Not only that, you're, you have two parties from very, very different upbringings. Right.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:14.280
[Guest]: So one is reacting very strongly to something, the other one thinks this is nothing. And,

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.840
[Guest]: and then the hurts begin to accumulate. You did not pay attention to my feelings. You

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:25.640
[Guest]: always do that. And the conversation doesn't go beyond that, because we don't have a template.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.280
[Guest]: Our parents didn't go beyond that. No one else is going beyond that. You don't really

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.440
[Guest]: want to go to a psychiatrist or a therapist, because you don't feel that, you know, the

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.600
[Guest]: situation is that bad. And yet there is those little things. Yeah, there are those little

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:46.520
[Guest]: knots. And because I had to write week after week, it wasn't a choice I made. It was those

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:52.440
[Amit Varma]: knots that wanted to be unraveled. So my other question here is that as your kids grew up,

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.440
[Amit Varma]: they became aware that mommy writes a column. And presumably, they began to read it also

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.360
[Amit Varma]: at some point. And did that, for example, affect their attitude towards you or their

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.080
[Amit Varma]: behavior? Because like, was there a performative element to that? You know, in the back of

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:14.720
[Guest]: the head, would they be aware that, oh, she may write about this or? Yeah. So my middle

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:20.920
[Guest]: daughter, she was the first one to put it on the table. So there would be things she

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:27.560
[Guest]: would show me that she would say, don't put this out. You know, so clearly, there was

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:35.640
[Guest]: an awareness that if she likes it very much, she Instagrams it, you know, or she makes

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:40.520
[Guest]: a Facebook post out of it. And they enjoyed my enjoyment of things. But when they felt

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.920
[Guest]: that something was private, she was the first one. She activated the opt out clause. Yeah,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:55.960
[Guest]: yeah, she did. So she was the first one to do that. And then what I get from them in

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:02.920
[Guest]: a sense is, you know, my oldest daughter, she's now 14. She read the book, and she was

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:10.880
[Guest]: the second person to read the book throughout. And her initial reactions would be, you know,

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:18.480
[Guest]: she would see herself as a younger version of herself. And she would connect. Oh, this

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:24.160
[Guest]: is something that I'm still angry about. Or I didn't like it when this happened. And,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.280
[Guest]: you know, she would come back to me. But when she finished the book, she actually wrote

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:33.760
[Guest]: me an email. And that's the first review of the book. It really is a review of the book.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:44.440
[Guest]: In which she writes, my mother is a hero on paper. And then she goes on to say that our

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:55.280
[Guest]: life is messier, angrier, harder than what it looks like in the column. But I understand

00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:02.640
[Guest]: what she's trying to do. She writes about being the kind of parent she wants to be.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:11.120
[Guest]: And in that sense, what has happened is that if, if I hadn't accessed the writer in me,

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:18.280
[Guest]: and tried to, you know, simplify things so that I could understand them, and that others

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.520
[Guest]: could resonate, that it would resonate with the stories of others, because the same thing

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:30.440
[Guest]: is happening in every family. What my children would have known of me would have been a mother

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:38.720
[Guest]: who tends to get very angry, who kind of gets into the victim position rather frequently,

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:45.760
[Guest]: more frequently than I like to remember, who struggles, and doesn't always do a great job

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:53.120
[Guest]: of figuring out her own feelings. But when I write, I am, I'm forced to figure them out.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:59.840
[Guest]: So what they were getting access to was what I was trying to do, which is the one thing

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:07.680
[Guest]: that I realized I never had access to, with my own mother. So you try, try, try to understand

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.760
[Guest]: where your parent is coming from. And then you give up because you become powerful as

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:18.200
[Guest]: a young adult. And you just judge them and you, you know, push them into a bin. And you

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.400
[Guest]: say, I'm never going to make the same mistakes again, not realizing that eventually you're

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:30.320
[Guest]: going to behave as you have seen them behave and struggle with that behavior as well. So

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.720
[Guest]: the same thing happened with my mother. And I think that perhaps for me is the greatest,

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:42.320
[Guest]: I didn't anticipate it, but it is the greatest achievement of the book. And my mother once,

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.600
[Guest]: she read something and she came back to me and she said, and it had been a couple of

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.000
[Guest]: years. She said, I didn't know you think so hard. I didn't know, mujhe nahi pata tha ki

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.600
[Guest]: tu itna soshti hai cheezon ke paare. So you opened up your interior world to them. And

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:04.520
[Guest]: here, you know, I was opening up my interior world because I needed to, for myself. I was

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:09.840
[Guest]: actually going forward doing that because I had got an audience that was very, very

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:18.320
[Guest]: gentle and kind and receptive of that writing. But within our family, we didn't have a platform

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:24.280
[Guest]: in which we could talk to each other in the same way. And when she was reading me from

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:31.800
[Guest]: a very far distance, she was able to hear me in a way that she had not been able to

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:38.440
[Guest]: hear me as a parent. And I was able to hear her and speak of her in a way that I hadn't

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.840
[Guest]: been able to as her child.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's very interesting. A couple of weeks back on Facebook, you posted a lovely little

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.120
[Amit Varma]: piece by her. And what I was really struck by there was the assuredness of the writing,

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:58.400
[Amit Varma]: the quality of the sentences, you know, short, crisp sentences, keeping it really simple.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, the clarity in that. Is that something that you think she picked up from your writing

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:10.000
[Amit Varma]: or, you know, because that is craft. You can be born with an artistic sense, but craft

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.840
[Amit Varma]: is something you have to work at. So I was very struck by that. Has she ever discussed

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.480
[Guest]: your writing with you?

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:26.320
[Guest]: So this is my oldest daughter, Seher. She has read me consistently. And, you know, I

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.920
[Guest]: wonder, so when she wrote this review of the book, and I call it a review, but she actually

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:39.120
[Guest]: wrote me a mail after reading the book, when she wrote it to me, I, I felt that she had

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:46.680
[Guest]: taken the kind of personal writing I was doing to a new level. And, you know, I was, I was

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:53.440
[Guest]: not ready to read that depth of truth. She actually pointed out to me things that I had

00:22:53.440 --> 00:23:03.200
[Guest]: begun to gloss over myself. And it made me think that, you know, rather than the fact

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:11.800
[Guest]: that she may be influenced by me, it made me think that perhaps when I write, I am accessing

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:19.280
[Guest]: that cleaner thought process that, you know, what would we might call childlike, but we

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:26.040
[Guest]: always appreciate it when it comes out, you know, in writing, you know, straightforward.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:34.760
[Guest]: And I know that I know how hard I have to work to be able to get that 1000 word column

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:43.680
[Guest]: out. So, you know, if it is submitted on a Tuesday morning, my brain has begun to work

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:51.280
[Guest]: on it from the Friday before that. And I will, you know, nap at odd hours, I will, you know,

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:56.040
[Guest]: go to sleep at three in the afternoon, I'll sit with my computer, I have begun to actually

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:03.360
[Guest]: fall asleep on the keyboard. And I realized that I'm not sleeping, I'm shutting down the,

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.360
[Guest]: you know, the very conscious thought process of what how should I create this and allowing

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:16.800
[Guest]: a much more organic thought process to to reveal itself and, you know, come out through

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:23.960
[Guest]: the typing. And so perhaps what she has is an is an original way of writing. She also

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:29.840
[Guest]: reads a lot. And it's it's amazing the, you know, they not only read what we read, while

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:35.600
[Guest]: we were growing up, but there is such a huge body of writing for young adults, now that

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:41.440
[Guest]: they access through the libraries, that and because we don't have TV, they really read

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:47.520
[Guest]: a lot. Because there's nothing else to do if they're not cycling or playing in the park.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:52.920
[Guest]: So so a lot is coming from contemporary writing as well.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.520
[Amit Varma]: And with you know, with regard to parenting itself, like, do you think that there are

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.200
[Amit Varma]: different levels of parenting that you end up doing? Because one is the actual parenting.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.680
[Amit Varma]: And one, in a sense, is a performative parenting, which you're doing for yourself, as fodder

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.600
[Amit Varma]: for your own thing, that this is what I should do, or this is, you know, does that make you

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.200
[Amit Varma]: a different kind of parent?

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:19.200
[Guest]: Okay, so I'll tell you what my experience with parenting has been. I started with my

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:26.720
[Guest]: first child as this super enthusiastic, always attentive parent. And you know, I'm it by

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:33.280
[Guest]: the third year, I realized that I was performing. I was performing for myself, I was performing

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:39.040
[Guest]: for everybody else. I wanted my mother to see me as a certain kind of parent. I wanted

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:45.240
[Amit Varma]: my mother in law to see me as a certain kind of parent, to see myself as a certain kind

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.120
[Guest]: of parent. My parents lived nearby, and we would spend a lot of time with my mother in

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:57.040
[Guest]: law when the first child came in, first grandchild in the family and stuff like that. And so

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:06.920
[Guest]: my notion of the good parent was in itself very performative. And that has, that that

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:12.560
[Guest]: has decreased over the years, so that I have learned that if they ask me a question, a

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:20.100
[Guest]: tricky question, it is not my job to necessarily answer it. I'm just supposed to allow that

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:26.520
[Guest]: question to, to arrive in the space within the family and for everyone to think about

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:32.280
[Guest]: it as they want to. I am not the solution provider. I am not the one who has to fix

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:37.960
[Guest]: everything, which was not only a traditional notion of motherhood that's thrust upon you,

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.760
[Guest]: but also one that I had very actively embraced.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.680
[Amit Varma]: And also a notion of adulthood, like completely unrelated to parenting. One of the things

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.960
[Amit Varma]: you figure out when you hit 40 years, both of us did a few years ago is that, you know,

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.800
[Amit Varma]: you're not sorted. You're not supposed to have figured it all out. You've been winging

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.720
[Guest]: it all along and you'll continue to wing it and that's fine.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.820
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely. And somewhere this comes from this very, very early question that every

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:05.480
[Guest]: adult is always firing at every child. What do you want to be when you grow up? You know,

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:11.880
[Guest]: and when we were in our early 20s, how can you not know what you want to do? Or if you

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.480
[Guest]: had a good job, how can you not want to do the same job for the rest of your life? And

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:22.080
[Guest]: it did ring true. None of this rang true to us. You know, as a generation, as a world,

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:28.600
[Guest]: we had come to a point where you could actually do many things that the most successful people

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:36.920
[Guest]: historically had actually also been prime ministers, also writing books, also, you know,

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:43.400
[Guest]: being sports people. So you, unless you are expressing all your talents, and you realize

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:49.360
[Guest]: by the time you're 40 that everybody is talented, that each one of us does not have that one,

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:54.920
[Guest]: two or three talents that were discovered by some generous soul when you were, you know,

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.720
[Guest]: in your early years, but that there is so much more to you. And it may not have revealed

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:06.600
[Guest]: itself when I was six or 15, but it will reveal itself when I'm 46. How come you started writing

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.880
[Guest]: you didn't used to write before? You know, so the notion is that every talent, you know,

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.200
[Guest]: that there is a certain number of things that you will be good at. And you discover that

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.560
[Amit Varma]: that's not true. And there doesn't need to be a linear path. So life is not like a school

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.800
[Amit Varma]: project that this is the aim. And this is how you get there. It's just a really messed

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.480
[Guest]: up journey, messy journey. Yeah. And even school projects, I mean, education systems

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.520
[Guest]: are constantly discovering that this one way of doing, you know, breaking it into subjects

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:37.480
[Guest]: and doing the learn and do the exam and then forget about it and learn something new is

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:43.520
[Amit Varma]: not the way we learn. And is it a process while parenting where you sort of disassociate

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.120
[Amit Varma]: from the parenthood aspect of it and just start relating to them in different ways as

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:52.560
[Amit Varma]: people as they grow older? You know, like in a sense, when you refer to Seher's email

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.280
[Amit Varma]: as your first review, for a moment, you've stepped back and you're, you know, it's a

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:01.360
[Amit Varma]: writer reviewer relationship almost. Does that happen more and more? Do you have to

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.680
[Amit Varma]: force it to happen and not stay in the parent mode?

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:13.880
[Guest]: It does happen more and more. And I think I got lucky with my first child. I was a very,

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:20.280
[Guest]: very serious, committed parent with my second child because I was taking it all so seriously.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:26.640
[Guest]: I began to break down and crash and not be able to hold it all together and therefore

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:33.320
[Guest]: discover that I was not supposed to hold it all together. And with my third child, you

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:40.320
[Guest]: know, who we hadn't planned to have at all. But by the time we had our third child, I

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:46.640
[Guest]: had quit my job. I was, you know, trying out all kinds of new things in my life. And I

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:53.600
[Guest]: had calmed down. I had calmed down as a parent because I had seen an utter and complete defeat.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:59.680
[Guest]: So I was, you know, at ground zero and ready to start again. And I didn't have any pressure

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:06.720
[Guest]: on me. We also almost lost her. So there was a very, very, you know, we had I'd had a very

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:14.360
[Guest]: emotional, traumatic time. And literally, it was like coming back from ground zero because

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:21.200
[Guest]: there was one point where we could have lost me also. And coming back from there, you know,

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:28.720
[Guest]: just kind of got me in touch with the core of what it's all meant to be about. And because

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:34.800
[Guest]: raising the third child was so different from the way I had behaved with the other two,

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:41.320
[Guest]: I learned through that, that I could behave in the same way with the middle child and

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:46.160
[Guest]: the older child that I was so easy with the new one, because just the fact that we had

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:54.040
[Guest]: survived it, we had come back home to living beings was enough for me. I had no other expectations.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.400
[Guest]: That was just it remained enough for me for years. So I let her be. And then I was like,

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:04.560
[Guest]: why don't I let everyone else be? You know, why don't, why am I, you know, if I'm satisfied

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:10.920
[Guest]: just to be alive with this child, then I should be able to take that feeling to almost everything

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:17.520
[Guest]: else in my life. And that kind of, you know, it helped to break this whole perfectionist

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:22.360
[Guest]: mold that I had been quite besotted with. You know, you're good at something, you just

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.720
[Guest]: feel compelled to always be good at it. I am the best parent.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.920
[Guest]: Not only that, even professionally. Yeah, absolutely. You've done really well at it,

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:36.720
[Guest]: then what's the next thing you can stop? You don't have to keep getting better at things.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:42.920
[Guest]: And somewhere it just become over the years has helped me to form a much calmer worldview.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.640
[Amit Varma]: And it's very interesting. A lot of I've read a lot of writers on parenthood, but most of

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:51.240
[Amit Varma]: them looking at it from a vantage point or in retrospect, and you've almost been sort

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.440
[Amit Varma]: of live blogging parenthood in a manner of speaking. You've been a witness and a chronic

00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:01.360
[Amit Varma]: clear of the reality show inside your own head and in your own life. So to sort of go

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:08.040
[Amit Varma]: back to parenting per se, what has this experience over the last decade and a half, which is

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.560
[Amit Varma]: culminated in this book, taught you about parenting? And if you could meet the 32 year

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:18.600
[Amit Varma]: old Natasha just about to embark on a journey, what advice would you give the 32 year old?

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:32.800
[Guest]: The advice I give to the 32 year old me is to calm down to take it easy and to slow down.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:38.000
[Guest]: So those are the big lessons that don't try too hard and just things. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:47.120
[Guest]: What the 32 year old me was getting away with was being able to pretend to be okay, even

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:54.440
[Guest]: if she wasn't feeling okay, because that's what I had winged all the way up to there.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:59.960
[Guest]: And when it all became too much for me, I had to completely change the way in which

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:06.800
[Guest]: I was surviving. And you realize as a parent that you can't just survive because then you're

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:13.960
[Guest]: just handing them the same template that, you know, if you want, you know that you want

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:18.520
[Guest]: them to have more privileges than you ever had. But to do that, you have to acknowledge

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:23.440
[Guest]: them to yourself. You have to give them to yourself. You have to tell yourself that it

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:31.680
[Guest]: is okay not to, you know, always not to depend on the endorsement of the outer world, not

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.600
[Guest]: to depend on validation from everyone else, because you think you can keep getting yours

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:41.640
[Guest]: while you will free them of that burden. But they'll only know how to free themselves of

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.560
[Guest]: that burden if you give it up in the first place.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.840
[Amit Varma]: That's very enlightening. Thanks so much for talking to me, Natasha.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:34:14.720
[Amit Varma]: Thank you. Thank you, Amit.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.200
