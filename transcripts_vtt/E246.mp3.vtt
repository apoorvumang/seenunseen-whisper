00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680
[Amit Varma]: Given what cricket means for so many Indians, it's tempting to draw parallels between the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.680
[Amit Varma]: story of cricket and the story of India. In some ways, cricket reflects how Indian society

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.000
[Amit Varma]: has changed over the last few decades. We started out uncertain of our place in the

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.120
[Amit Varma]: world, trying to find our feet, hobbled by an inferiority complex, looking for pride

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.680
[Amit Varma]: in small constellations, but eventually opening up to the world and asserting ourselves. But

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.360
[Amit Varma]: this comparison only goes so far. Our cricket has flourished to a point where India dominates

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.920
[Amit Varma]: this game, especially in a commercial sense. In some ways, it also embodies the best of

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.160
[Amit Varma]: what this country can be. It is inclusive of players from the remotest parts and showcases

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.560
[Amit Varma]: a healthy way to love your nation. I contrast that with the state of the nation today, where

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.760
[Amit Varma]: our economy is in a precarious place, our society is facing so many different kinds

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.920
[Amit Varma]: of ruptures, our politics has become so polarizing and toxic. George Orwell once spoke of sport

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.080
[Amit Varma]: as war minus the shooting. He was alluding to the ugly tribal instincts that sport can

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.280
[Amit Varma]: bring out. But cricket, it seems to me, has evolved to a place where it can sometimes

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.160
[Amit Varma]: take us beyond that tribal place. If that's so, then that's one more thing to love about

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:35.600
[Unknown]: Indian cricket. And there's a lot to love about it.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.160
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My guest today is Ayaz Memon, cricket journalist for

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.080
[Amit Varma]: 42 years now, and indeed such a legend of cricket journalism that his Twitter handle

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.400
[Amit Varma]: at Cricketwala is basically how he is known. Ayaz is the editor of a superb new anthology

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.540
[Amit Varma]: called Indian Innings, the journey of Indian cricket since 1947. The book has selections

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.120
[Amit Varma]: from over 60 writers spanning the decades since independence and captures many of the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.280
[Amit Varma]: fine milestones and characters of the game. In some ways, it's not just about the journey

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.760
[Amit Varma]: of cricket, but also the journey of cricket writing. I'm honored to have a couple of pieces

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.920
[Amit Varma]: in this anthology, and the rest of the writers constitute a who's who of Indian cricket writing.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.040
[Amit Varma]: It's a fabulous book to sit back with and get a sense of the rich history of this fine

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.720
[Amit Varma]: game, which, as Ashish Nandy once said, is quote, an Indian game invented by the English,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.560
[Amit Varma]: stop quote. But I didn't just talk to Ayaz about cricket. He has also been a major figure

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.840
[Amit Varma]: of Indian journalism as the editor of Midday in the 90s, and later an editor with the Times

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.480
[Amit Varma]: of India and DNA. He's been a stalwart in the industry. So we spoke about cricket and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.080
[Amit Varma]: journalism about India about this and that my podcast tend to be like a test match. So

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.440
[Amit Varma]: sit back and enjoy. But before we begin, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.440
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.040
[Amit Varma]: habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.080
[Amit Varma]: essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.920
[Amit Varma]: face is, how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.700
[Amit Varma]: the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way, a couple of friends of mine run this

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.400
[Amit Varma]: awesome company called CTQ compounds at ctq compounds.com, which aims to help people up

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.280
[Amit Varma]: level themselves by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of the programs called

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.460
[Amit Varma]: the daily reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read the

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.680
[Amit Varma]: subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.560
[Amit Varma]: This helped me build a habit of reading at the end of every day, I understood the world

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.480
[Amit Varma]: a little better than I did before. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.280
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. Thank you so much, Amit. Thank you for having me.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.600
[Amit Varma]: When one speaks to you, there's so much to talk about. Because you've covered Indian

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.960
[Amit Varma]: cricket for you know, more than 40 years now. And plus beyond all of that, I don't just

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.400
[Amit Varma]: want to talk to you about cricket because obviously, you've been a prominent journalist,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.840
[Amit Varma]: you've been editor of midday and all of that. And I'd be interested in hearing about your

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.120
[Amit Varma]: thoughts on the evolution of journalism as well. But before that, take me back to your

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.000
[Amit Varma]: childhood. You were born in the mid 50s. So tell me about what growing up there was like

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.200
[Amit Varma]: because one often hears this thing about India and as an 80s kid, I also know this to be

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.640
[Amit Varma]: true that I was born in the 70s. But kind of my memories are from the 80s where that

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.120
[Amit Varma]: old cliche about India is kind of true in the sense that you just had cricket in Bollywood,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.800
[Amit Varma]: there was no other way to entertain yourself. And if you were growing up, you couldn't help

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.360
[Amit Varma]: but be attracted to one of those things. And you are of course, a legend of cricket journalism,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.160
[Amit Varma]: but more than that, also a cricket lover as is apparent in every word that you speak.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.520
[Amit Varma]: So how did this love affair start?

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.240
[Guest]: Well, I mean, look, you're right. I mean, cricket and cinema were the abiding passions.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.920
[Guest]: But in my house, there was no cinema because my father was quite opposed to movies. He

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.880
[Guest]: was a lawyer. And my mother told me subsequently, after my father died, that he actually was

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.120
[Guest]: very interested in cinema up to a point. And then whatever happened, he just switched off

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.460
[Guest]: cinema. I think his favorites used to be Kundan Lal Saigal and you know, all that that generation.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.840
[Guest]: But cricket was an obsession even with him. And since I was, you know, a late, late child,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:05.220
[Guest]: I was born after 17 years. So the way I was pampered was my mother, my father was a lawyer,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.200
[Guest]: so he would be at work through the week and come home rather late. So my mother would

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.040
[Guest]: sneak off to the cinema with her friends in as much as was possible in the very conservative

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:23.600
[Guest]: society and tag me along. So I saw some movies in radio talkies near Crawford Market. And

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.600
[Guest]: you know, some of them were really the real tear jerkers, as you call them. And then you

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.200
[Guest]: would see my mother's weeping, her friends are weeping. And I would wonder as a child

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.320
[Guest]: what the hell is happening. But the other thing which was happening in my life was that

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.020
[Guest]: I was getting a cricket bat or a cricket ball as a gift from my father. And then I think

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.320
[Guest]: in many ways, the turning point for me was getting a copy of Wisden. We used to have

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:55.280
[Guest]: a house in Lonavala. My father used to take us there and meet him at the railway station.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:02.200
[Guest]: He would come by the Deccan Queen, which is an iconic train service, as we know. And,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.240
[Guest]: you know, one day he walked out of the compartment and he had this, it looked like a brick or

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.240
[Guest]: a couple of bricks that he was holding in his hand. He said, hey, this is for you. You

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:19.560
[Guest]: know, and I, I was maybe seven or something like that. And I said, this is just too big

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.000
[Guest]: for me to handle, you know. And I went back, we went back home and I started reading those

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.800
[Guest]: pages. And that's where I got my first feel of reading about cricket, you know. And because

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.960
[Guest]: we had a small little porch in front of the little garden, in his pyjamas, my father would

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.840
[Guest]: bowl to me and I would be batting or the other way around. And that's when, that's when I

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:49.120
[Guest]: started getting initiated into cricket. And he was such an avid follower that there was

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.940
[Guest]: a match between Australia and some other country. And I remember it was England, I think, 62-63.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.440
[Guest]: He would wake up early in the morning to catch the commentary on Radio Australia. And I started

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:06.240
[Guest]: waking up and listening to the commentary. And that's when this kind of appreciation

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:13.080
[Guest]: and also this love for cricket started growing. And then once I got that, that copy of Wisden,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.640
[Guest]: I started exploring it further because you can't finish Wisden in one quick read. You

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.000
[Guest]: have to keep diving into it and you find something new and something more marvellous and something

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.480
[Guest]: more remarkable. And I think one thing which absolutely fascinated me, troubled me for

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.760
[Guest]: a while, was my father posed three questions to me. I remember this very distinctly when

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:38.800
[Guest]: we were in Lonavala. He said, okay, so now you're fond of cricket and all that. So whose

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:47.000
[Guest]: batting average is 99.94? Who's taken 19 wickets in a test match? And then there was the third

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.880
[Guest]: question. He said, who made a triple century and never played a match again, a test match

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:57.080
[Guest]: again? So the first two, I found rather easily in many ways, because you went to the highest

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:03.640
[Guest]: averages, you found Don Bradman 99.94 and Jim Laker 19 wickets in a test match. And

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:09.920
[Guest]: I got completely bamboozled by the third one, which is Andrew Sandham, which is Andrew Sandham.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.720
[Guest]: And I went back and forth and I said, triple century and not played again. And then, you

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.400
[Guest]: know, by a process of elimination, you found out who made the triple centuries. And Andrew

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:29.960
[Guest]: Sandham was a guy who in 1929-30, he played a timeless test match. This came in a timeless

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.640
[Guest]: test. He actually made a half century also in that match and never played again because

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:42.160
[Guest]: he was 39-40 by that time. So, you know, just discovering Andrew Sandham's name was such

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.080
[Guest]: a high for me that I couldn't get over it for many, many days. It was almost like, you

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:53.240
[Guest]: know, I played a game of chess or he had played a game of chess with me and I'd checkmated

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.400
[Guest]: him. I found the answer. I went and told him. And of course, he was delighted. But these

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:03.640
[Guest]: were the early years. And I think that the turning point was watching India beat Australia

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:12.440
[Guest]: at the Bebon Stadium. Bobby Simpson's team versus Nawab of Pathodi's India. And somebody,

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.520
[Guest]: some relative of mine had some tickets for the Islam Jim Khanna stands. I didn't see

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.560
[Guest]: the first two days. We saw the last three days of the match. And it was a cliffhanger.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.320
[Guest]: The match went into, you know, I mean, it was like edge of the seat excitement. Narrowly

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.520
[Guest]: India won. Chandu Bode and Indrajeet Singh, the wicketkeeper, who I got to know very well

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.840
[Guest]: later. Both of them, Bode and Indrajeet Singh. Chandu Bode, I think, made 33 and took India

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:43.760
[Guest]: to victory. And there, there was an eruption when India hit the winning runs with Bode.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.320
[Guest]: And people jumped over. There was not too much security then. Everybody jumped onto

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:54.320
[Guest]: the ground and ran towards the CCI pavilion. And then after a while, everybody's shouting

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.760
[Guest]: slogans and, you know, waiting for the team to greet their heroes. And then Pathodi comes

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:04.200
[Guest]: out on the balcony along with Chandrashekhar and Bode and some of the others. And that

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.960
[Guest]: was the most decisive moment for me, I think. You know, I just got completely hooked to

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.960
[Guest]: cricket.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, just thinking back on my own childhood, for example, like if you ask a young person

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.040
[Amit Varma]: today, when did you fall in love with cricket? Their memory will be visual. They would have

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.680
[Amit Varma]: probably seen something on television, some great innings, some World Cup final, and that

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.800
[Amit Varma]: is a moment and all of that. And for us, in the pre-TV days, those visuals kind of weren't

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.680
[Amit Varma]: there. Like I remember when I was a kid, my dad had once given me this book, not the Wizard

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.400
[Amit Varma]: Cricketer's Almanac, as you mentioned, which I had the great pride of writing for in the

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.240
[Amit Varma]: early 2000s. So that was like something that you looked up to in the childhood actually

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:47.240
[Amit Varma]: happening. But this Wizard Book of Test Cricket, which was published in 1977 and had every

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.600
[Amit Varma]: scorecard until then, and all the records and everything. And I remember going through

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.240
[Amit Varma]: it and I practically knew every scorecard by heart. And of course, there weren't so

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.720
[Amit Varma]: many tests played until then. And what was so delightful about that was that we were

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.360
[Amit Varma]: making stories in our heads. Yes, about all these characters, like you, you know, you

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.000
[Amit Varma]: brought up Andrew Sandham, I remembered Ari Foster, who made 287 on debut, right, and

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.640
[Amit Varma]: never made 100 again. And I realized that many of these memories from my childhood are

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.760
[Amit Varma]: very vivid for me, like as a growing up fan, I knew every triple century, right? Right.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.560
[Amit Varma]: And whenever somebody would reach sort of a triple 100, you'd kind of start counting

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:32.680
[Amit Varma]: that person down that, oh, okay, 310 is Edric, 311 is Simpson, then 334, 336 is Hammond,

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:38.520
[Amit Varma]: 334, of course, Bradman, and so on. And right up to adulthood, like many Indians have scored

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:43.960
[Amit Varma]: more than 236 not out today, but that is still sort of an iconic figure because that for

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.480
[Amit Varma]: many, many years, that was a high score by an Indian, which of course, Gavaskar had.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.480
[Guest]: Also getting past Bradman. And getting, you know, 30th century. So 30th century. So you

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:59.640
[Amit Varma]: can. So do you also feel that because one of the things that people say about memory

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:05.120
[Amit Varma]: is that when you kind of get on in years, as to some extent, both of us are, what you

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.880
[Amit Varma]: remember really vividly, the other bookends, a lot of the middle becomes kind of mushy,

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.840
[Amit Varma]: and you kind of forget that. But you remember those early childhood memories very vividly.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:20.400
[Amit Varma]: And you remember what just happened yesterday. But a lot of stuff in between is kind of just

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.480
[Amit Varma]: a blur. And I remember that struck me with a tinge of sadness because my dad before he

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.040
[Amit Varma]: passed away earlier this year, I think last year, I sat down with him and I said, you

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.840
[Amit Varma]: know, I just took a recorder and I said, Okay, I have all this audio equipment, let me talk

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:38.920
[Amit Varma]: to you about your memories. And he remembered his childhood and his youth incredibly vividly.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.480
[Amit Varma]: And then at one point, and he was suffering from Parkinson's as we later found. And at

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.480
[Amit Varma]: one point, he turned to me and he said that I don't remember you as the child. I don't

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.400
[Amit Varma]: remember anything of the years you grew up. So tell me a little bit about that, which

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.120
[Amit Varma]: is just an aside, I thought I'll throw out there because I'm very fascinated by the way

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.720
[Amit Varma]: that memory works. And the fact that you and I can remember, you know, I'm sure entire

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.640
[Amit Varma]: scorecards from our childhood, but perhaps not something that we covered in the middle

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.160
[Amit Varma]: of our journalistic years. Is that sort of true? Do you remember?

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:14.640
[Guest]: No, I mean, it's true. So there are two things that I can, you know, say that has happened.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.680
[Guest]: I'm not a psychoanalyst in that sense. So I can only talk about myself. One is that

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:26.520
[Guest]: when I started following cricket, there was not enough visual experience to go by. There

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:32.040
[Guest]: was no television in my house till at least the late 70s, actually, if I remember and

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:37.960
[Guest]: that was a black and white to camera. And there was not too many pictures in newspapers.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:43.280
[Guest]: The magazine Sportsweek, at least in Mumbai or Bombay started in 1968. There was sports

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:48.760
[Guest]: and pastime, sport and pastime coming from Chennai, which one didn't get regularly. We

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.280
[Guest]: were not subscribing to it. And, you know, Chennai was a long way away from Bombay in

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:59.600
[Guest]: those days. So you dived into these books or newspaper reports, and you actually created

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:05.760
[Guest]: a visual experience for yourself. So, you know, if you read about Sir Garfield Sobers

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.620
[Guest]: hitting Malcolm Nash for six sixes and over, now, you know, you can see it on YouTube.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:16.920
[Guest]: But when it actually happened, one can only one could only imagine it and visualize as

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:23.360
[Guest]: you imagine it. And therefore, those memories actually struck quite was quite vivid for

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.520
[Guest]: me, you know, some of may have some of them may have been exaggerated, a little flawed,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.560
[Guest]: but they stuck and therefore also the scorecards and the descriptions around it stuck, you

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:39.480
[Guest]: know, so, Tiger Pataudi batting on one leg in Australia in 1967, you know, already with

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:44.040
[Guest]: one eye already with one eye back in one leg because he was injured. And, you know, just

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.120
[Guest]: the description and you what you read and what you heard on radio had very powerful

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:58.520
[Guest]: impact. And now, what is because there's such a profusion of action that one can see, and

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.960
[Guest]: it comes to you from all sources, it can come to you on your mobile phone, it's obviously

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.800
[Guest]: there on your television, it's there in the archival material, if you want to access it,

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:13.080
[Guest]: you can see just about anything. So you can seek out what you missed. And it is there

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.400
[Guest]: and try and match it. But there's also so much of it that what you've actually seen,

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:23.040
[Guest]: you tend to lose sight of, or you tend to forget. You know, it's been 13 years since

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.200
[Guest]: the IPL has been played. If you ask me which knock or innings that I remember, the only

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.840
[Guest]: one which I remember the first one which I saw was Brendan McCallum making 158 in the

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.160
[Guest]: first match when the tournament just took off. But if you ask me some of the other terrific

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:44.360
[Guest]: knocks played by AB de Villiers or Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma, I'm hazy. I don't know. Test

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:51.460
[Guest]: matches, I would be far more, you know, it's far stronger, the impact. I remember distinctly

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.640
[Guest]: Sachin Tendulkar's first innings, you know, in Karachi. But that was also because it was

00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:02.760
[Guest]: such a momentous event, you know, a 16 year old getting into the Indian team, first rivals

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:08.040
[Guest]: is Pakistan, the match is at Karachi and, you know, he doesn't make too many runs. Then

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.980
[Guest]: of course, as the series progresses, he played in the last test, he gets hit on the face

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.360
[Guest]: by Vakar Younis, stands up and hits a boundary. Then we go to Peshawar and then he's hitting

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:21.000
[Guest]: those sixes of Abdul Qadir. By the time that tour ends, Tendulkar is a household name across

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.240
[Guest]: the world. So those memories are very distinct, but there are so many others. I can't remember

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.360
[Guest]: too much of the other players. Tendulkar, I can remember because it seemed to me just

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:36.400
[Guest]: so much more significant in that particular series. And likewise, I mean, Gavaskar's last

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:43.840
[Guest]: innings of his test career, 96 at Bangalore, it's almost as if I can remember every delivery.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.840
[Guest]: Wow.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.720
[Guest]: You know, I mean, you know, speaking broadly for the manner in which he played on that

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:55.480
[Guest]: minefield of a pitch, you know, when Tausif Ahmed was bowling to him and the ball was

00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:01.560
[Guest]: breaking off the pitch and bouncing, and this guy would just kind of, you know, move outside

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.520
[Guest]: the line of the ball, move to the offside, let the ball pass. If you look at the scorecard,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.880
[Guest]: I think there are a fair number of buys there, because the wicketkeeper couldn't judge the

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:17.080
[Guest]: bounce or the spin as well as Gavaskar could. Of course, he was also obscured by Gavaskar.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:22.840
[Guest]: But I'm just saying that the mastery of Gavaskar in that innings is something that I can't,

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.800
[Guest]: you know, it doesn't get erased. It's not got erased from my mind. Or Kapil Dev's catch

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.960
[Guest]: in the World Cup or his 175, which, you know, I was privileged to see live.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.920
[Amit Varma]: We'll kind of talk about all of that. And these are, again, seminal moments. And in

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.440
[Amit Varma]: Sachin's case, there's a backstory because you had actually seen him before that. I think

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.560
[Amit Varma]: you'd mentioned once that Dilip Engsarkar had called you and said, come with me and

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.560
[Guest]: see this boy.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:50.960
[Guest]: Yes, Dilip Engsarkar was the captain of India. And, you know, our office was in Tardeo, the

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:56.520
[Guest]: Sportsweek office. And Dilip used to live at, in those days, I think, he had, I think,

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:02.840
[Guest]: moved to Worli, you know, in Sportsfield building. And he said, he called up and said, let's

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:09.080
[Guest]: go and watch Sachin Tendulkar bat. I had some work. I didn't go along with him. But I followed

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.240
[Guest]: him. And we met at CCI. And by that time, Sachin was, I think he had notched up another

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.040
[Guest]: hundred or whatever. So Dilip was most excited to see him.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:23.840
[Guest]: Also, I think in the, in the Bombay cricket environment, they were all watching this young

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:29.840
[Guest]: boy very intently, not just Dilip, but Raj Singh Dungarpur, you know, who rates amongst

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.480
[Guest]: the most amazing, fascinating characters I've seen and had the experience of knowing in

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:41.600
[Guest]: Indian cricket. So he was there. He was, you know, he was just kind of, you couldn't put

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.760
[Guest]: him down. He was just bouncing all over the place in CCI, watching Tendulkar bat. And

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.760
[Guest]: he would come and, you know, he'd go from person to person, say, did you see that shot?

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.560
[Guest]: You know, did you see? Now that they put a fielder on the boundary, so he's not hitting

00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.760
[Guest]: the fours. He's pushing for ones and twos. See how much cricket intelligence he has.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:06.400
[Guest]: So, you know, Raj Singh Dungarpur was also president of CCI. And he gave him the membership

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:13.700
[Guest]: when he was not even eligible. He was underage in that sense. But he was absolutely obsessed

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:21.100
[Guest]: by Sachin. So watching Sachin at that age was, in many ways, an exposure to a genius

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:27.680
[Guest]: in the making. And also, in many ways, an insight into what was happening in Indian

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.840
[Guest]: cricket around that same time, how the spread of cricket was happening, not just in Bombay.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:38.480
[Guest]: But you know, there are two eras, which I say, one is the pre-Sachin era and the post-Sachin

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.560
[Guest]: era. In the pre-Sachin era, to which all of us belonged, parents would say, school jao,

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:49.240
[Guest]: yeh ho, whatever sports is fine, this, that, we'll see how it goes. But don't waste your

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.080
[Guest]: time too much. First get a job and then. In the post-Sachin era, now you go to Shivaji

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.880
[Guest]: Park or any of the maidans, young mums and dads go and tell the coach, isko tendulkar

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:05.680
[Guest]: banalo, isko Sachin banao. They are not interested in whether they finish 12th with distinction

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:13.080
[Guest]: or graduation. But if they can, if you can become a Sachin or now Virat Kohli or Dhoni,

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:19.360
[Guest]: that is enough for them, which is a major shift. Tendulkar was, you know, as you said,

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:25.920
[Guest]: a seminal moment in Indian cricket and Indian life. You know, you just started reimagining,

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:31.520
[Guest]: especially where sport is concerned. And cricket, if you look at the average age of cricketers,

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:37.240
[Guest]: the English always used to have fairly experienced guys getting into the test team. They played

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:42.040
[Guest]: some eight, ten, seven years of county cricket and they come in. The Pakistanis used to have

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.800
[Guest]: the youngest, you know, teenagers would break into the team. The Aussies would blood their

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:52.560
[Guest]: cricketers fairly young. The Indians were, because there was a whole process, schools

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.440
[Guest]: cricket, college cricket, then you get into universities cricket, if you do well there,

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:02.440
[Guest]: then you get into Ranji cricket. So, 20, 21, 22 was usually the age when the Indian cricketers

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:08.720
[Guest]: would get into the national team or why for a place in the national team. Tendulkar created

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:15.200
[Guest]: a paradigm shift. Now, and with the IPL coming in, you know, there are 16, 17, 18-year-old

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.600
[Guest]: guys getting in. If you're 24, 25 and if you've not made it to the Indian team today, it's

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:26.880
[Guest]: tough. You know, it's tough. Maybe your sell-by date has gone in many ways.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I think there was a lament a couple of years back from Shreya Sair. You're saying,

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.720
[Guest]: hey, I'm 24, time is passing by. I need to get back to the Indian team.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:39.040
[Guest]: I mean, exactly. You know, one can sense what he's feeling because it's not just about Shreya

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.200
[Guest]: Sair. There are swarms of cricketers coming from all over the country. What were the bastions

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:50.080
[Guest]: of other sports earlier, hockey, for instance, in Punjab is no longer, you know, the bastion

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:56.040
[Guest]: for hockey. It's also, you know, Kerala is no longer the bastion for football. You know,

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:01.640
[Guest]: cricket is just taken over. So, you might feel that it's a bit of a lopsided situation

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.800
[Guest]: in where sports is concerned in India, but that's how it is.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and it's interesting that it's lopsided in terms of playing. It's not lopsided in

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:14.120
[Amit Varma]: terms of watching per se. That people are watching many more sports with enthusiasm

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.600
[Amit Varma]: than they did once in a while, which I think to some extent is also reflected in the sports

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.080
[Amit Varma]: pages and the kind of coverage that happens. But, you know, you can watch a lot of Premier

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.920
[Amit Varma]: League, but there's no quality football really happening in India, which can make you aspire

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.600
[Amit Varma]: to that. So, I'd actually say that there were three eras. Like, there's a pre-Sachin

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:37.720
[Amit Varma]: era. And the Sachin era is really the post-liberalization era also, in a sense, wherein the game goes

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:43.160
[Amit Varma]: to the small towns and that sort of that dominance of Delhi-Mumbai is kind of broken. And, you

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.920
[Amit Varma]: know, it just goes into an entirely different sort of demographic, as it were. And the third

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:53.320
[Amit Varma]: era for me is really IPL, because I think it just changed the incentive so much. In

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.120
[Amit Varma]: terms of the ecosystem being so much richer, the incentives, you know, even in the post-Sachin

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:04.480
[Amit Varma]: era, if a parent wanted her child to be Sachin, they would realize that it's a nice dream

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.360
[Amit Varma]: to have, but the odds are thoroughly stacked against it. And if the kid doesn't make it

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:12.200
[Amit Varma]: to the national team, nothing's going to happen. But today, that's not the case. Today, your

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.760
[Amit Varma]: kid doesn't have to be in the top 10 in the country. A top 100 in the country means he's

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.400
[Guest]: making crores. Yes. And it just opened up, you know, so many options for young kids because

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:27.520
[Guest]: there are more teams. Also, what made a big difference, you talked about the liberalization

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:32.680
[Guest]: coming in that era, also cable television. Yeah, exactly. That's what really took it

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.760
[Guest]: into every house, every nook and corner of this country. And, you know, cricket is played

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:42.600
[Guest]: over a longer period of time than every other sport, maybe golf, which runs over a few days.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.960
[Guest]: But otherwise, test cricket over five days. One-day cricket is a one-day match, you know.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.960
[Guest]: Even T20 is three and a half hours, four hours, which is more. So, there's more television

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:58.400
[Guest]: time. And while cricket is a team sport, actually, the focus is on individuals. So, when a batsman

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.680
[Guest]: is there in the middle, he's at the crease, the camera is focused entirely on him when

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.160
[Guest]: the ball is about to be bowled. When a fielder feels the ball, it is that one player that

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.760
[Guest]: you're focusing on. If he takes a catch, then the celebrations and all that. In many ways,

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.320
[Guest]: it's a one-on-one rivalry between the batsman and the bowler. So, it just gives so much

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:23.120
[Amit Varma]: more importance to the individual in a team game. Also, not just to the individual person,

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.160
[Amit Varma]: but to the individual moment. Like a three-hour game of cricket is not one event. It is a

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.240
[Guest]: series of all these small events, like depending on how many balls there are. It's all discrete

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:38.000
[Guest]: events. Look at it this way, Amit. If I'm a bowler, I can bowl over the wicket, round

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.080
[Guest]: the wicket, over the wicket. I have to just inform the umpire. I can keep changing my

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:48.240
[Guest]: mind. The captain or the bowler can keep changing the field. So, every ball is an independent

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:56.240
[Guest]: event in itself. And it's very staccato. Unlike, say, football or hockey or some of the other

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:03.480
[Guest]: team sports where the flow is not easily stopped. But here, you can deliberately stop it.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, every moment in a football field is, in a sense, determined by the moment before,

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.520
[Amit Varma]: where everybody was, what was happening, all the momentum and direction and everything.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.120
[Amit Varma]: Whereas that might be psychologically true in a cricketing sense, but otherwise every

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.120
[Guest]: ball is a separate event.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.160
[Guest]: Which is why there's so much importance to tactics and strategy. Because in football

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:27.200
[Guest]: and hockey or rugby, all the tactics are done prior to, you know, you have changes in tactics,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.920
[Guest]: but the blueprint is prepared much in advance. In cricket nowadays, in T20, perhaps that

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:40.400
[Guest]: is being done more than ever before. But yet, it is how the game unfolds that, you know,

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.600
[Guest]: you can improvise, you can implement changes. And that's why the role of the captain becomes

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:52.520
[Guest]: so important. Because the captain is an interventionist. It's not what the manager and coach has told

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.160
[Guest]: you earlier. But if, you know, you want to change the field in consultation with the

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.560
[Guest]: bowler, then you can do it immediately.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, the captains can change the flow of the game in a way that they can't in any other

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.280
[Amit Varma]: sport. But see, you know, this is what happened. Two Indians start a conversation. It is about

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.560
[Amit Varma]: something, but it always comes down to cricket. We were talking about you. So I'm going to

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.600
[Amit Varma]: sort of, though of course, we will keep coming back to cricket. But to get back to the biographical

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.800
[Amit Varma]: bit, you've already kind of spoken about how you discovered, you know, you got the wisdom

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.760
[Amit Varma]: creators. Almanac, you've spoken elsewhere about how you used to buy secondhand cricket

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:30.080
[Guest]: books from the footpath at Andloom House in the Fort area in Mumbai. I think that's part

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.080
[Guest]: of your introduction.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.800
[Guest]: Secondhand books, yes. Playfair Cricket Annual was my favourite because wisdom was still

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.880
[Amit Varma]: pretty expensive.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.240
[Amit Varma]: Is there a moment where beyond a cricket book, you discovered that there is something called

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.880
[Amit Varma]: cricket writing?

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:49.080
[Guest]: Yes. You know, one went from the book and said, you know, you start, you're at an age

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:55.840
[Guest]: when you start exploring. And because cricket was gripping my mind, and how do I find, you

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.080
[Guest]: know, something that is happening every day, keep myself updated. That's when you turn

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:05.160
[Guest]: to the newspapers. And we used to get two or three newspapers in the house, where amongst

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:11.200
[Guest]: the first names that I read from sports was K.N. Prabhu of the Times of India. There was

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.360
[Guest]: also Ron Hendricks, who was the Indian Express, I think in those days. He didn't write too

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.560
[Guest]: much on cricket. He was more for the other sports, but he had a good, he had a good turn

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:26.200
[Guest]: of phrase, which I started enjoying. Prabhu was very lyrical. And, you know, he would

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:32.440
[Guest]: blend a lot of nostalgia with match reports and, you know, very distinctive flavour to

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:38.760
[Guest]: his writing. And when I got to know him personally, many years later, he was, he just about completely

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.360
[Guest]: fit the, you know, the image I had in my mind of what kind of a person he would be, how

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.600
[Guest]: he would look and how he would be as a companion. I shared the room, I shared a room with him

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:53.800
[Guest]: on several occasions during test matches. And then there was much later Khaled Ansari.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:29:00.120
[Guest]: 68 was when he started Sportsweek magazine. Khaled Ansari was all fire and brimstone,

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:07.800
[Guest]: you know, all very, his editorials would be all taking the pants off authorities and federation

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:13.440
[Guest]: heads and, you know, whatever else. But it was good fun to read. And it kind of enticed

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.320
[Guest]: me into this whole thing about sports writing and sports journalism. So I started reading

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.720
[Guest]: the newspapers very, I became a very voracious reader. And obviously, when you're at that

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:28.280
[Guest]: age, and you have a passion for sports, you start reading from the back page onwards.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:33.760
[Guest]: But remember, in the 60s and 70s, right up to the 80s, 90s, perhaps, sports was like

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:39.240
[Guest]: a country cousin in the newsroom. You had one, one and a half pages, so it was, you

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.960
[Guest]: know, just too much space to see the pages now. And I remember when I joined DNA, when

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:49.760
[Guest]: we started DNA, we had a six page, eight page supplement, which is unthinkable. In 2005,

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:58.560
[Guest]: I think that was. So otherwise, sports was one, one page, one and a half page at best.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.260
[Guest]: And then it became two pages, two and a half pages, three pages. But that's a function

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.280
[Guest]: also of the economic growth of the country when, you know, post liberalization, most

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:12.960
[Guest]: of these things happened. But my liking for sports writing started very early, I think

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:19.400
[Guest]: in about 68, 69, 70 was the time and 71 was the turning point in the lives of so many

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:24.000
[Guest]: people who grew up in that era, India winning against the West Indies and India winning

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:32.040
[Guest]: against England. And that twin series, I think, in in many ways, just made me a complete cricket

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:39.440
[Guest]: nut. That was, I mean, I was very fond of cricket, but then it became an obsession in

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.440
[Guest]: 1970, 71.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, one of the things I liked about your anthology is not just that for any lover

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.240
[Amit Varma]: of Indian cricket, it's obviously manna from the heavens, because there's so much great

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.640
[Amit Varma]: material here, but it's also an anthology of cricket writing. Like these people you've

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.560
[Amit Varma]: just named, you've got a couple of pieces from Prabhu about 71, you've got a piece by

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:03.200
[Amit Varma]: Khalid Ansari about 74, I think. And I picked up this lovely line from Prabhu, because in

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:08.120
[Amit Varma]: 71, in one of the reports that you've reproduced in your book, he writes about how a lot of

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:13.200
[Amit Varma]: critics have been proved wrong by that first test win, because they had said that Sardesai

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.880
[Amit Varma]: and I think Durrani and Venkat should not have been selected, but they have been. And

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:22.120
[Amit Varma]: for these critics, he writes these two sentences, quote, the new literates of cricket, however,

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:26.600
[Amit Varma]: are rarely right in such matters. Their petty prejudices have been exposed by the manner

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:30.960
[Amit Varma]: in which these players have performed, stop quote. And I was like, dude, if K.N. Prabhu

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.080
[Amit Varma]: lived in the time of Twitter, how many people would he respond to?

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:40.760
[Guest]: That perhaps is two harshest sentences I've read from K.N. Prabhu. But, you know, he had

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:48.440
[Guest]: a very strong impact on, you know, cricket writing was by and large in the English newspapers.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.440
[Guest]: The regional newspapers became stronger later. And there have been some very, very fine writers,

00:31:53.440 --> 00:32:00.080
[Guest]: Bal Karmarkar, I know from Maharashtra Times. And he was also a very avid cricket follower

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.200
[Guest]: and cricket writer. He went on to also become, I think, managing editor of the paper. So,

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:10.160
[Guest]: he moved away a little from sports. But regional papers joined in later because the space that

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:16.760
[Guest]: was available for sports was far more meagre in regional papers, more were available in

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:22.400
[Guest]: English newspapers, because most of the advertising came to English newspapers. So, they had more

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:28.160
[Guest]: pages. So, if Times of India in the 1970s, 80s was 10, 12 pages, the regional papers

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.200
[Guest]: would be six, eight pages. And therefore, there was a restriction on how much space

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:41.560
[Guest]: you could give. So, yeah, I mean, K.N. Prabhu, I think these people brought home to people

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:46.600
[Guest]: like me, readers like me, K.N. Prabhu was in the West Indies, K.N. Prabhu was in England.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:53.680
[Guest]: So, he would also talk about, you know, clouds hovering over Lourdes or Oval, and you start

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.880
[Guest]: getting a sense of what England could be, you know, and not knowing that you would ever

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:04.400
[Guest]: get to England when you're 10, 11, 12, you have no idea. But you start enjoying that,

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.880
[Guest]: you know, the imagery that he creates. And that's part of the fascination for cricket

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.680
[Guest]: writing, which grips or at least gripped me when I was young, that it took you into distant

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:21.040
[Guest]: lands and brought you, you know, color and tapestry and flavor of those lands. It's a

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:27.080
[Guest]: lot more now, you know, cricket writers today have to do a lot more work. They bring you

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:32.480
[Guest]: color stories, they bring you profiles of people who may have no relation at all with

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:38.760
[Guest]: the game, but they are emblematic in the sense of where you are, which country you're touring.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:45.160
[Guest]: So for instance, you might meet, you might read about a chapati maker in Trinidad, you

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:49.480
[Guest]: know, who will throw in a stray line about an Indian cricketer that becomes reason enough

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:54.480
[Guest]: to do a story. So, all that is far more now, because there's more space available and obviously

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.800
[Guest]: there's more consumption available. But in the old days, you had to live with what you

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:04.480
[Guest]: got and these guys were bringing home some fantastic, you know, for an impressionable

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:11.800
[Guest]: mind, creating this fantastic story that one could absorb and put into the hard disk. So,

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:17.680
[Guest]: I remember that when I went to England for the first time, that was for the 1983 World

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:22.640
[Guest]: Cup. Apart from reading and whatever else I had done of K. N. Prabhu, I had met him

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.840
[Guest]: by then. I was a journalist. I was, you know, in awe of him, but I spent a lot of time with

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:33.600
[Guest]: him trying to understand what touring meant, what was his, you know, when he met Sir Garfield

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:38.040
[Guest]: Sobers in person or Rohan Kanhai, who was also one of my favourites, what were they

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:43.760
[Guest]: like as people and grounds that he went to, Queen's Park Oval or Lords. So, when I went

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:51.360
[Guest]: to England, I was looking for things that K. N. Prabhu had also seen and had told me.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:57.240
[Guest]: Not that I found all of it, you know, so, but it was a great way of, it was a kind of

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:03.200
[Guest]: a segue into a whole cricket world, which I had only dreamt about. And then it's now

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.040
[Guest]: coming up, coming, coming to fruition in my own life. And that was a source of great delight.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:13.360
[Guest]: I mean, when I went to England, I was 27, almost 28 for the World Cup, but I almost

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:19.280
[Guest]: felt like, you know, Alice in Wonderland. No, D. J. Woo, but also, you know, I mean,

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:25.040
[Guest]: I knew the grounds, Lords, Grace Gates, but to enter that and see, I mean, I had some

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:32.880
[Guest]: great experiences with Grace Gates and, you know, so, for instance, when I went and not

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:38.960
[Guest]: all experiences were great, you know, when we went to England, when I say we are fellow

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:46.400
[Guest]: journalists also, we were refused accreditation for matches at Lords. So, you know, because

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:52.200
[Guest]: MCC was a distinct body and the others were with the TCCB, Test and County Cricket Board.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.840
[Guest]: So, we got passes for all the other matches and we were refused. He said, no, unless India

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:04.680
[Guest]: is playing here, which may be in the final and ha-ha-ha, not likely. So, no pass. As

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:10.720
[Guest]: it happened, India reached the final. So, prior to the match, I went to the, I went

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:20.080
[Guest]: to Grace Gates, you know, chest puffed out and the stewards at the Grace Gates are real

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:24.920
[Guest]: stick in the muds, you know, very stiff upper lip and where are you going? I said, I have

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:30.200
[Guest]: to go and get my accreditation. So, why haven't you got your accreditation? I said, we had

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:34.000
[Guest]: not qualified, India had not qualified. So, now they've qualified. India was in West

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.560
[Guest]: Indies and I need an accreditation. So, this guy turns around to his other colleague in

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:44.080
[Guest]: the, you know, steward at the Grace Gates and says, oh, now we've got Gandhi coming

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:50.560
[Guest]: to Lords. Because that was the time Gandhi, the movie also had, you know, made waves globally.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:56.240
[Guest]: So, that's how it was, that's how pompous it was, you know, and of course, then India

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:03.920
[Guest]: went on to win the World Cup. And now, I think, I don't think anybody questions Indian journalists

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:09.800
[Guest]: going to Lords because India is so strong in the sport today, that if you don't have

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:15.920
[Guest]: a game with India at Lords for X number of years, then obviously their finances are dented.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:21.000
[Guest]: So, India is a much coveted team or a much coveted country to come and play in Lords

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.040
[Guest]: or Oval or wherever else, which wasn't necessarily the case earlier.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's like Mohammed and the Mountain. It's the roles have kind

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.680
[Amit Varma]: of reversed. But before we come to 83, and of course, I'll, you know, dredge into your

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.560
[Amit Varma]: memories on that, a couple of questions strike me from what you were just talking about.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:44.320
[Amit Varma]: And one of them is this, that there's a situation that I remember happening in the pre-television

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:49.320
[Amit Varma]: days, which we've alluded to earlier that you're not actually visually seeing something

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:55.000
[Amit Varma]: play out. So when I think of 71, for example, we've all read so much about Sardesai and

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.080
[Amit Varma]: how he batted and he was really as important as Gavaskar in many ways, you know, a remarkable

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:04.560
[Amit Varma]: series there. But I can't picture him in my mindset, because I've never really seen him

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.520
[Amit Varma]: per se. You spoke about Rohan Kanhai being one of your heroes. And I don't know if you

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.360
[Amit Varma]: actually saw him either back then or not. So on the one hand, we are having to construct

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.640
[Amit Varma]: all of this in our heads, which is one reason they might be stronger in our memories. On

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:22.040
[Amit Varma]: the other hand, there is the media being produced about this, you know, the writing about this

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:27.160
[Amit Varma]: is not that much, there's a small sample size. And the people who are writing these reports,

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:32.120
[Amit Varma]: their incentives are to dramatize everything. Because every cricket writer wants to write

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.760
[Amit Varma]: an epic cricket report. And whenever something epic actually happens, they want to make it

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.920
[Amit Varma]: even more epic than that. And that's a temptation. I remember that I gave way to when I was a

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:47.440
[Amit Varma]: young writer in my 20s. It's like you hear about Wally Hammond writing about Amar Singh

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:53.480
[Amit Varma]: and how the ball came off the cracks of doors, you know that immortal quote. And at one level,

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:57.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, it's memorable, everybody remembers it. But at another level, I'm just thinking

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:03.520
[Amit Varma]: no it didn't. All of our fast bowlers, forget Bumrah, you know, the fifth net bowler for

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:09.200
[Amit Varma]: Mumbai Indians probably can bowl that exact ball which drove Wally Hammond to say whatever

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:15.120
[Amit Varma]: he said. And this then begs the question that when you're growing up in those times, how

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:19.080
[Amit Varma]: reliable are these memories because part of these memories are your own construction.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:24.600
[Amit Varma]: And partly they are based on what people who have the incentive to dramatize unnecessarily

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.720
[Amit Varma]: have made it up to be. And eventually, of course, we watch television and we watch Gavaskar

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.720
[Amit Varma]: make 96. And we know that, you know, we've seen it with our own eyes. So I'm kind of

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:38.840
[Amit Varma]: asking you at one level about the fan in you, but also about the journalist in you.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:43.240
[Guest]: So I mean, this is a complex question. And I think it's a very interesting question.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:50.640
[Guest]: I think this is my surmise that before television, before one could actually access matches visually

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:57.240
[Guest]: and make your own judgment, you relied on somebody else's opinion or his reading of

00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:03.560
[Guest]: a situation. And in the case of sports, because, you know, there's so much glory and there's

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:10.360
[Guest]: so much achievement associated with it. There was always this thing for people who witnessed

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:16.480
[Guest]: it to pump it up or also be skating about it without quite understanding why they need

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:21.320
[Guest]: to be. So both worked, you know, one could be, you know, I mean, just to give you an

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:29.920
[Guest]: example and it's all very situational. When Douglas Jardine implemented body line as a

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:37.240
[Guest]: tactic, all hell broke loose. But Clive Lloyd's West Indian team with four fast bowlers did

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:44.000
[Guest]: exactly that. Without except for the field restriction, there was no not much change.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000
[Guest]: In fact, these four guys were all lethal, you know, and even when helmets were not as

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.400
[Guest]: much in use as they are now. Gavaskar, for instance, never wore the helmet. So a lot

00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:01.600
[Guest]: of what we see in the pre-television era is, and when we read, is all very situational.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.840
[Guest]: It is dramatized. You know, Neville Cardus, one of the greatest writers, many say that

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:12.800
[Guest]: he just completely exaggerated. It was his imagination more than what actually happened.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:18.600
[Guest]: What I think also is that matches were sparse and scarce. Independent India's first series

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:29.200
[Guest]: was to Australia, 1947. The next series when we went to Australia was when? In 1967. Twenty

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:36.240
[Guest]: years later. So 20 years later, if I was K. N. Prabhu, who went on that tour and watching

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:43.480
[Guest]: India play Australia, the whole situation is full of so many dimensions that you end

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:52.360
[Guest]: up either seeing it with a completely exaggerated point of view, or you can be so prosaic that

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.480
[Guest]: it makes no sense to your readers. So you have to somehow strike this balance. I can't

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.560
[Guest]: go and say that, you know, decent, you know, all good length deliveries, patented gentry

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.960
[Guest]: back down the pitch and, you know, everything is fine. No, that would not work at all. So

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.920
[Guest]: the journalist in K. N. Prabhu, or if I was there, I would say, how do I sharpen things

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:16.440
[Guest]: up or how do I make it exciting for the reader back home? Because he has no other way of

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:21.520
[Guest]: knowing what is happening. And therefore, I think a lot of writing that has happened

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:29.640
[Guest]: prior to television becoming all pervasive is of a certain flavour. So you'll find in

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:35.160
[Guest]: a lot of stuff, even like a very polished writer like K. N. Prabhu, if India has done

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:40.520
[Guest]: well in a certain match, his opening sentence will be, rejoice, we've done it, you know,

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:49.080
[Guest]: something like that. To carry that sentiment of the achievements of a team back to people

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:54.400
[Guest]: who have absolutely no access as to what is happening. And also one must understand the

00:42:54.400 --> 00:43:01.520
[Guest]: mindset of, or the national psyche of the people back then. The way people see themselves

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:06.360
[Guest]: as Indians today is vastly different from how they saw themselves in 71, or even 80,

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:12.400
[Guest]: and certainly of 47. I must tell you this, in 1947, India went to Australia. In one of

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:20.800
[Guest]: the county matches, not in a test match, Don Bradman got his 100th century. And it was

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:27.640
[Guest]: of an Indian bowler who lived in Baroda. And when I was in Sportsweek, and I was editing

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:35.160
[Guest]: Sportsweek, there would be a letter every third day, postcard coming, that, you know,

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:40.280
[Guest]: so-and-so has not got enough recognition for being the bowler of which Don Bradman scored

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:47.360
[Guest]: his 100th century, from the cricketer himself. So you can imagine that the sense of pride

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:53.160
[Guest]: was, hamare saamne saw, you know, he made his 100th century. Not that, you know, I got

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:58.720
[Guest]: his wicket, I didn't allow him to make the 100th century. And that is also how writers

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:04.680
[Guest]: then saw it. If I was a writer in 1947, accompanying the Indian team, and I'm what, first of all,

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:09.080
[Guest]: I would be completely beguiled by the presence of Don Bradman in the middle. Because Don

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:15.240
[Guest]: Bradman was, you know, Don Bradman, Don Bradman, yeah. And then to see him bat and then to

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:21.880
[Guest]: make him achieve this landmark, and you have to just gush. And not worry about whether

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:27.160
[Guest]: it came against your own team, you know, which is there to compete. And therefore, I think

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:34.720
[Guest]: the whole situational thing matters in where you are. You know, sport is epochal. It's

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.880
[Guest]: to do with, it's not ordinary, you know, especially at the elite level. What these guys are supposed

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:46.760
[Guest]: to do is something extraordinary. And whatever is extraordinary will invite a lot more imagination

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:52.880
[Guest]: attached to it than what is everyday humdrum life that we all live, we all lead. So if

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:57.760
[Guest]: Kapil Dev hits four sixes of Eddie Hemmings to avoid the follow-on, you can't say he hit

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:01.840
[Guest]: four sixes and India avoided the follow-on. You know, you have to have two, three paras

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:08.400
[Guest]: which describe it in such terms that it grips the imagination of the reader. If it doesn't

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:15.120
[Guest]: do that, then it's a problem. But the writing changes from a journalism point of view, if

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:22.200
[Guest]: I'm also watching it as a viewer. If I'm watching it, and if I read a report which is complete

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.840
[Guest]: exaggeration, then I'll say, what the hell is this guy talking about here? I watched

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:31.720
[Guest]: the match. It wasn't like this, you know. So that's been the shift in your, how do you

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:39.640
[Guest]: adapt even your writing skills and your journalism in the visual era, as we say. And now, of

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:43.960
[Guest]: course, it's not just watching a match with two cameras or four cameras. Now there are

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:48.440
[Guest]: 28 cameras. There are multiple slow-mo's. They are taking it down to the, you know,

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:56.920
[Guest]: they are splitting it into, it's fragmented so much that what is it that the writer can

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.800
[Guest]: add, which is already not being discussed by the slow-mo's and the experts on television,

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:07.960
[Guest]: is really the challenge now for journalists. What do they do as writers? You know, is there

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:13.240
[Guest]: a quick, do I just go and get a quote from, quote each from five experts who are there,

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:17.400
[Guest]: or five other former players who are there, or do I just get a fancy reaction from the

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.880
[Guest]: stands? What do I do? How do I construct a story? It's become a, that's become the big

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:30.440
[Guest]: challenge. When I went on my first tour, it was to Pakistan. I crossed over on foot with

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:36.880
[Guest]: my luggage and one manual typewriter. And I had taken loads, it was a three-month tour.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:41.960
[Guest]: So I took loads of sports magazines and film magazines. Time pass karna hai, what do you

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.720
[Guest]: do between test matches and, you know, or during test matches, five days in a place.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.760
[Guest]: Five days before smartphones, you can't browse Twitter and do video calls.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:55.560
[Guest]: So all my film magazines got confiscated by the customs that they wouldn't allow film

00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:00.800
[Guest]: magazines from India to get into, and political magazines. Sports magazines jo aap leke jao.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.360
[Guest]: But those are things that, these are experiential stories that one can, they have become far

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:11.880
[Guest]: more commonplace now. On a cricket tour, what else happens outside the matches itself has

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.940
[Guest]: also gained a lot of currency, which wasn't there earlier. You focused on the cricket

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:22.200
[Guest]: and you got off, you know, and, you know, you did your tour diary, which was not in

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:27.800
[Guest]: so much, not, you know, there was not much gravel in it. Now there's a lot more that

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:34.960
[Guest]: one can do. But where the actual match is concerned, since the viewers seeing everything

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:39.920
[Guest]: in acute detail, then what do you do? That's the challenge now for the journalists today.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:43.520
[Amit Varma]: So that's what my next question was about. But before that, an observation to again point

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:47.800
[Amit Varma]: out how much I agree with that dilemma of a cricket writer, that you've had a session

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.360
[Amit Varma]: where there are like three runs in eight overs, what do you even write? It's very boring,

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:56.080
[Amit Varma]: bowler bowls, backspin blocks, and the writer feels the imperative to make it something

00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:00.640
[Amit Varma]: more. And typically, it is always something more, but it is always something more at a

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.520
[Amit Varma]: mental level, you don't know what the internal drama is that is there on the cricket field.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:09.880
[Amit Varma]: And often the writer will replicate their internal cricket drama while writing about

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:13.680
[Amit Varma]: what's happening on the field, which may or may not match up with what actually happened.

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.040
[Amit Varma]: It's like I've had a film director tell me once that boss, every time I read a critic

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:23.040
[Amit Varma]: writing about a film, I'm like, like, what has this person seen? That's not what I made.

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:27.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, the second thing is about the shift in writing itself, in the sense that I remember

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:32.560
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, when I joined Wisden, which later bought Crickinfo in the early 2000s,

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:37.440
[Amit Varma]: it was understood that the matches that we are reporting on are being watched on television,

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:42.480
[Amit Varma]: right? Information is now a commodity. If you're writing from England in 1971, information

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:47.280
[Amit Varma]: is valuable. Yes, you know, you have to describe everything, you have to try to paint that

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:54.080
[Amit Varma]: picture in the reader's mind and all of that. But in 2001, you know, just 30 years later,

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:58.960
[Amit Varma]: it's all there on the TV screen. So as writers, and I remember, you know, looking at match

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.360
[Amit Varma]: reports in the British newspapers, like the Guardian and the Observer and all that and

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:06.400
[Amit Varma]: the match report the next day would never describe what happened. Yes, it would go into

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.640
[Amit Varma]: other areas, it would be a little bit of commentary, a little color when we used to create our

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:14.840
[Amit Varma]: packages in Crickinfo, we'd have these color pieces, where, you know, whoever was at the

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:19.400
[Amit Varma]: ground would go out and report on something interesting, and you'd have your commentary

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:23.520
[Amit Varma]: and you'd have all of that. And that would in a sense change the writing and change the

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.680
[Amit Varma]: imperative for the journalist in the sense that you're no longer describing what happened,

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.840
[Amit Varma]: everybody knows what happened, what happened, you have to go deeper. And as you pointed

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:38.960
[Amit Varma]: out in these current times, where it's not just the 28 camera angles, it's the 280 statistical

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:44.880
[Amit Varma]: angles in terms of how finely diced stats have become. You know, even in football, for

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:49.120
[Amit Varma]: example, like one stat, which is really important for me when I watch football, is what is known

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:54.440
[Amit Varma]: as XG, which is expected goals. So it's not how many goals you actually scored, but how

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:58.400
[Amit Varma]: many goals you would have been expected to score the way you play. And over the long

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:02.680
[Amit Varma]: run, it evens out. And that's, for me, a much better measure of how well a team played than

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:07.160
[Amit Varma]: actual goals scored. And even in cricket, where that kind of probabilistic thinking

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:12.160
[Amit Varma]: was kind of absent over the decades, I find that more and more young writers are doing

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.960
[Amit Varma]: very interesting work in terms of just understanding the game and looking at the statistical analysis.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:23.360
[Amit Varma]: But that dilemma remains, like you pointed out, that when all these stats and these numbers

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:28.200
[Amit Varma]: are there, when all these experts are there on TV, who have played the game themselves,

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:32.960
[Amit Varma]: having their gyaan, what is a cricket writer to do? Ask a two-part question in terms of

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.520
[Amit Varma]: the evolution of your writing. Has there been one? And, you know, how would you describe

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:41.240
[Amit Varma]: it? And in general cricket writing, what do you think?

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:46.440
[Guest]: So look, the clear option available to writers, including me, you know, when television became

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:51.920
[Guest]: invasive, was you can't do ball-by-ball description or ordinary description, which everybody is

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.760
[Guest]: seeing. So what do you do? What does one do? There are colour pieces, which can be very,

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.960
[Guest]: you know, you need the power of expression. You need to be a skilful or skilled writer

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:07.360
[Guest]: to do that, to hold attention, because colour pieces are not easy or are not readily accepted

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:12.480
[Guest]: unless they are done in masterly fashion. You know, at least match reports, people will

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:16.480
[Guest]: say to fill the gaps in their own understanding of what has happened, ki information chahiye,

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:23.560
[Guest]: now information is available. But colour pieces to, for people to read, requires a lot more.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:28.520
[Guest]: It requires colour, it requires an understanding of the language, of the personality, of how

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:33.800
[Guest]: you probe, how you elicit something from the person who you are profiling, for instance,

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:39.120
[Guest]: or a controversy that you're dealing, what dimensions you can get, you know, into that.

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:45.680
[Guest]: So all that requires skill. And the third or another clear option was get skilled in

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:52.640
[Guest]: analysis, you know, get a more analytical or start getting that analytical bent of mind,

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:57.320
[Guest]: maybe approach a few experts who you have access to immediately available at the ground,

00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:03.200
[Guest]: and who either feed your analysis, make it stronger, or offer another dimension, which

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:08.200
[Guest]: you then leave for the reader to decide that this is what it looks like, but this is what

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:13.920
[Guest]: A, B or C feel or two players who contradict each other. So just makes it a little more

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.680
[Guest]: exciting for the, for the reader and say, wow, I didn't know this, you know, achha

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:26.240
[Guest]: it's like this. Sometimes you use clever tactics, you know, throw names, which impress the reader,

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:31.280
[Guest]: or tell the reader, yes, this guy's weight carries with if Gavaskar you quote or Tendulkar,

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.560
[Guest]: you know, people say, wow, you know, there must be something to it. But how do you weave

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:42.040
[Guest]: that in then becomes a skill into your story. So I think that's what is happening. As you

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:49.920
[Guest]: as we all know, now, there is everything that is available to the viewer and the listener

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:56.960
[Guest]: in real time. And more than just that, it's diced up into nano, you know, bits of information

00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:01.680
[Guest]: that you might need, then there are the experts who are all former players, most of them who

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:07.760
[Guest]: are also giving their gyan. So what is what is left for you to do? Actually, quite a lot.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:12.720
[Guest]: Okay, so let me explain. Cricket has become so big in India. I feel that if you want to

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:16.720
[Guest]: be a cricket writer today, you better skill yourself into forensics, because you never

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:23.040
[Guest]: know some, you know, Bob Woolmer died in the West Indies of a heart attack. And, you know,

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:27.760
[Guest]: all hell broke loose as if he's somebody somebody murdered him. And the reportage all changed

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:32.720
[Guest]: completely from World Cup cricket to every other thing except cricket. You better know

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:37.880
[Guest]: how to read balance sheets, because BCCI is money, the ecosystem that of the IPL, what

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:45.040
[Guest]: does it mean in terms of money, profits, profitability, losses, valuations that are going up of teams,

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:51.200
[Guest]: etc, etc. Those are hard cricket stories, which don't come from players, necessarily,

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:56.520
[Guest]: you have to go out and seek them. So you're not, you cannot remain a conventional old

00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:01.880
[Guest]: style cricket writer now, that is getting limited in value, you must understand mental

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:07.680
[Guest]: health today, for any sports. So therefore, also for cricket, you had Ben Stokes, the

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.240
[Guest]: best all rounder in the world, perhaps the best cricket in the world, virtually taking

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:17.280
[Guest]: a whole year off. Now there is enough scope to do so many stories about mental health,

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:23.640
[Guest]: using Ben Stokes as a peg, and so on. And then there is the third or one more dimension,

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:32.520
[Guest]: which is, where all our lives are data led. There's so much data available. Virat Kohli

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:40.760
[Guest]: has played 48 balls of this bowler and he's made 62 runs, but he's also got out five times.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:46.720
[Guest]: You know, that kind of data collation and extrapolation from that data can also lead

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:53.560
[Guest]: to stories. But it requires, again, conditioning your journalistic practices or your mindset

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:58.680
[Guest]: towards those things to remain relevant. So what is happening is now for the challenge

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:06.180
[Guest]: for professional writers, cricket writers, is to remain relevant. Because information

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:10.600
[Guest]: is coming from all quarters, you know, everybody has got information. Even those who are not

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:15.800
[Guest]: in media, you could be on Twitter, and an avid cricket follower, and you hit on a great

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:20.040
[Guest]: angle, which you might see, you might do on a thread, which runs into seven, eight threads,

00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:26.800
[Guest]: and might have more relevance than what any cricket writer has written. So, you know,

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:32.120
[Guest]: if your audience is exposed to so much, then how do you get that get currency? Why should

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:40.720
[Guest]: people come and read you? So you have to develop some attributes, not just longevity in service,

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:46.280
[Guest]: some attributes, which tell a reader that, you know, I must go and find out what he has

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:51.840
[Guest]: also written on this subject, or let me first find out if he has. And if he has, what has

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:59.040
[Guest]: he done? And therefore, you know, that's how I think it is working now. Because otherwise,

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:06.400
[Guest]: there's a big threat that relevancy of or the relevance of writers will just vanish.

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:11.760
[Amit Varma]: I agree with you that it's actually really exciting. And I think one way just thinking

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:17.280
[Amit Varma]: aloud at Summit Up is that a cricket writer today should not aspire to be Cardus. She

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:22.860
[Amit Varma]: should aspire to be CLR James. Absolutely. It's a fantastic analogy. You're not just

00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:26.440
[Amit Varma]: covering the sport. You're not covering what happened on the field, 11 men versus 11 men

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:32.080
[Amit Varma]: or 11 women versus 11 women. But you're covering everything around it. Yes. You know, the sociology

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:36.640
[Amit Varma]: of it, the psychology of it. And the politics of it. And the politics of it increasingly

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:40.120
[Amit Varma]: in these modern times. Yes. Which one wonders whether one will be able to write about cricket

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:46.080
[Guest]: after a while. Yes. Yeah. And the kinds of personalities, you know, I think that's also

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:53.600
[Guest]: the mental aspect of sport is the biggest issue that has emerged over the last maybe

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:59.360
[Guest]: 25-30 years, and getting bigger and bigger. You know, I used to read when I was in Sports

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:03.800
[Guest]: Week in my early years. So there would be Tennis World, or World of Tennis, one of these

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:08.200
[Guest]: magazines from which used to come from the US. And I remember that was the McEnroe,

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:13.160
[Guest]: Connors, Borg era. And then, you know, there would be so much about the mental aspect of

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:16.920
[Guest]: tennis. And I used to say, what the hell? I mean, sport is sport. You go out there,

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:21.640
[Guest]: you know, your technique, your skills, that is what matters. But I, you know, when I think

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:27.520
[Guest]: back how wrong I was, because ultimately, everything else is secondary to the mental

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:34.400
[Guest]: aspect. You know, we talk of great Caribbean flair, and, you know, the way they played.

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:38.320
[Guest]: And, you know, there was never a worry in their mind the way they would go out and play.

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:42.840
[Guest]: But actually, that's a stereotype. Because there was a mental aspect to the game. The

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:48.840
[Guest]: aspirations and the ambitions may have been different. The sense of leaving an impact

00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:54.440
[Guest]: of their own identity may have differed from ours, as CLR James expresses so wonderfully

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:59.000
[Guest]: in Beyond the Boundary, you know. It's an expression of West Indian, Caribbean thought

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:06.000
[Guest]: and life, and also racial politics and everything. It's a magnum opus when you look at it, you

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.280
[Guest]: know. West Indies cricket, how it fits into CLR James's theory, you know, as a Marxist

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:17.160
[Guest]: philosopher is absolutely riveting. You may disagree, but it's riveting, you know, to

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:21.760
[Guest]: think about it in those dimensions. In India, we never thought about it like that. You know,

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:26.480
[Guest]: we've started to think now, in India, I think we're still very personality obsessed, rather

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:33.240
[Guest]: than the sport and its ramifications in national life. We're getting there. We're talking more

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:38.820
[Guest]: and more about it. But I think that that is a very important dimension that needs to be

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:43.120
[Guest]: looked at more aggressively. Where cricket writing is concerned now, I think because

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:49.920
[Guest]: it is coming from everywhere, including the non-formal sector, I think there's a lot of

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:54.880
[Guest]: cacophony. Obviously, there will be a lot of mediocrity, but there'll also be some brilliant

00:58:54.880 --> 00:59:00.960
[Guest]: stuff coming. Unexpectedly, you don't necessarily have to look at it only from the 15 names

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:06.160
[Guest]: you know. It can come from anywhere. And, you know, one has to appreciate. So, if you

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:10.440
[Guest]: enjoy cricket writing and reading about cricket, obviously, you have to make the effort to

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:15.720
[Guest]: find out where this is going to come from. It's a clutter. It's, you know, it's very

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:21.560
[Guest]: random, it's disorganized, it's chaotic, but it is there. And I think overall, it enriches

00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.560
[Amit Varma]: cricket writing.

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:28.160
[Amit Varma]: No, and I think that, you know, just from what I have kind of seen in the last 22 years,

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:32.200
[Amit Varma]: I think the fact that those barriers to entry have gone, that you don't have gatekeepers

00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:36.440
[Amit Varma]: of taste and style and form standing in the way that anybody can write anything and then

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:40.280
[Amit Varma]: let water find its own level. You know, I think that's incredible, because I think what

00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:47.320
[Amit Varma]: often happens, especially in mainstream media, is that you have people who have a set vision

00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:52.000
[Amit Varma]: of what something is like, that coverage should be like this. This is what I want a cricket

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.800
[Amit Varma]: report should be, this is the form, do this, don't do that, don't do that, do this, you

00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:01.680
[Amit Varma]: know. And I think all of that acts as a tremendous constraint, especially when that mainstream

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:07.160
[Amit Varma]: media becomes out of touch, especially when your kind of gatekeepers are not particularly

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:11.720
[Amit Varma]: competent as can often be the case, that, you know, just having the ability to go out

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:16.000
[Amit Varma]: there like I, you know, in my writing class, I had one of my participants in the latest

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.800
[Amit Varma]: cohort is a cricket writer somewhere for some website, I forget the name, though, obviously,

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.600
[Amit Varma]: I wouldn't mention it, even if I hadn't forgotten it. But he spoke about how the pressure there

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:30.640
[Amit Varma]: is always to follow whatever is the latest thing that happened, you know, that Virat

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.960
[Amit Varma]: Kohli got a bruise on his elbow, you have 40 stories on that. And then in the evening,

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.400
[Amit Varma]: something else would have happened and you have 40 stories on that. And you're constantly

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.120
[Amit Varma]: going from immediate story to story, all of it is shallow. And he was complaining about

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:48.880
[Amit Varma]: how he doesn't get the time to kind of sit back and do his own writing. And all of that,

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.600
[Amit Varma]: which is, again, a dilemma coming from a cricket writer, who would probably be a fan of CLR

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.600
[Amit Varma]: James, who probably wants to do that kind of writing. But within mainstream media, that

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.480
[Amit Varma]: space isn't there. Because one, there is this desperation to keep the eyeballs going because

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:07.960
[Amit Varma]: you're in that game, where you're increasingly becoming irrelevant anyway. And that's just

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.960
[Guest]: not there.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.320
[Guest]: So that's, that's part of the problem with mainstream media, irrespective of sector,

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.880
[Guest]: you know, I mean, it could be sports, it could be politics, it could be business. So there's

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.920
[Guest]: a herd instinct at play there. So if it is Kohli, you know, everybody will write about

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:29.080
[Guest]: Kohli that day, you know, and then it's only a matter of debating whose first three paragraphs

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.400
[Guest]: read better than the others. And that's you got the rest of the story.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.800
[Amit Varma]: It's like when Chuck Prince of Citibank said about the financial boom that happened before

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.120
[Amit Varma]: the crash in 2008. And he said, when the music's playing, everyone has to dance.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:46.920
[Guest]: Correct. Yeah, that's true. But I think, you know, so the consumption of content for want

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:52.840
[Guest]: of a better word or consumption of media has changed dramatically. And therefore, and it's

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:59.640
[Guest]: also changed dramatically because the pipelines feeding media or information to the world

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:05.520
[Guest]: at large have also changed. It's been a massive change. Today, it can come from any quarter.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:11.600
[Guest]: Mainstream media, I think, is hamstrung. It's becoming predictable. And in many ways, it

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:20.200
[Guest]: is becoming not gratifying enough, you know, for what I'm looking for. I'm speaking generally

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:25.960
[Guest]: that it may not gratify me. And it's like when you switch on television sets today,

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.320
[Guest]: you switch on one, you don't need to switch on the others, you know exactly what is happening

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.080
[Guest]: on the other channels. The rare channel which doesn't do what everybody else is doing, you'll

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:38.480
[Guest]: go and switch that on. Because you want something else to be, you know, fed into your, you know,

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.800
[Guest]: you want to consume that. Otherwise, I'm not gaining anything. Ultimately, we all start

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.440
[Guest]: making these calculations in our own minds. What am I getting out of it? If I want to

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.800
[Guest]: watch the same nonsense, why should I shift from channel A, B, C, D, E? I'll shut them

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.800
[Unknown]: all off.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.600
[Unknown]: Which is what I've done. I don't watch news television.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.320
[Guest]: And I go to a channel which at least tells me something which is not so predictable.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:02.680
[Guest]: And therefore, I start coveting that. Whether that channel makes money or not is not the

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:08.080
[Guest]: issue. And there'll be a herd, the herd instinct can get so large that it can engulf an entire

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:16.520
[Guest]: nation on certain issues. So, that doesn't make it right, you know. For seekers, you'll

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:21.760
[Guest]: have to look at things which gratify you, which give you that little delight, which

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.720
[Guest]: give you comfort, which give you entertainment, which give you satisfaction, you know, all

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.160
[Guest]: of those in the consumption of media.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:34.160
[Guest]: And likewise, then we can say whether it's in sports or politics or business writing

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:41.880
[Guest]: or business journalism, all of these will have to cater to the demand. Now, there is

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:49.000
[Guest]: one way of looking at how mass media operates is, look, we only do what the public is demanding.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:57.000
[Guest]: Right? So, that's not an unfair thought. But it also means that you are not venturing into

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:03.340
[Guest]: areas which will explore what else do people want? Or do they still want the same thing?

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:07.880
[Guest]: People switch on the television even out of habit. I'll be cooking, eating, whatever else

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:17.360
[Guest]: the TV is on, or the radio. But is it interesting enough for the consumer or is it just everybody

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.040
[Guest]: latching on to a bandwagon, getting on the bandwagon and doing the same productive, same

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:27.520
[Guest]: predictable stuff for years, is really something as a professional practitioner of journalism

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.400
[Guest]: or running a media house that you have to think about. Now, I'm saying this very, it's

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:36.720
[Guest]: very simplistic. But when you run organizations, there's business, the business angle, there

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:41.120
[Guest]: is balance sheet, I must be in the black, I must not be in the red. And therefore, whatever

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.080
[Guest]: makes me get into profitability, I will do all those things. They also come into play.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:52.520
[Guest]: I'm not one to pass judgment. You may do things which are really, frankly, very poor journalism

01:04:52.520 --> 01:05:00.480
[Guest]: and make a lot of money. It's possible, you know. You can put on the front page of newspapers

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:06.280
[Guest]: like in England, you know, some papers, some tabloids put pictures of men or women in various

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:12.400
[Guest]: stages of undress and people pick it up. Now, again, I'm not passing judgment. But if you

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:16.440
[Guest]: want to do that, that's fine. But there are other things also that can be done. So you

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:21.760
[Guest]: have to take a call. I think what is happening is in the consumption of media, people have

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:30.520
[Guest]: started taking a call. And especially in areas like sports, you know, it's not enough to

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:36.120
[Guest]: say, I belong to the leading newspaper, and therefore, I'm the best. It's not operating

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:41.000
[Guest]: like that at all. That has changed. In the old days, maybe you could say, there would

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.680
[Guest]: be, if it has to be contested that you're the best or not, there would be one other

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:51.600
[Guest]: option. Now there are plentiful options. You could say, I'm working for this newspaper,

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:55.080
[Guest]: you've got the best cricket writer. No, you don't. We've got so and so and it will be

01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:01.480
[Guest]: restricted to maybe two or three. But now, it's an endless kind of variety you can choose

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:02.480
[Guest]: from.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:06.800
[Amit Varma]: You know, I used to teach a podcasting course as well. And there I kind of spoke about how

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:11.640
[Amit Varma]: podcasting is so different from radio, in the sense that radio because of all kinds

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:17.120
[Amit Varma]: of financial incentives and imperatives, especially in India, where FM licenses cost so much,

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:21.040
[Amit Varma]: and there are restraints on what you can do and cannot do. Radio necessarily will be a

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:25.880
[Amit Varma]: mile broad and an inch deep. You know, whereas with a podcast, you have different podcasters

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:31.160
[Amit Varma]: exploring all kinds of different niches, and you never know what clicks. And the interesting

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:35.080
[Amit Varma]: thing there is not that they are catering to niches. The interesting thing there for

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:42.680
[Amit Varma]: me is that those niches come into being because somebody made that exploration in the first

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:47.520
[Amit Varma]: place. Otherwise, nobody would even have known that a niche existed. You know, if there is

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.720
[Amit Varma]: a niche today for people who listen to five hour podcast episodes, for example, you know,

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:55.840
[Amit Varma]: you got to thank Dan Carlin and Hardcore History. And if you're in India, maybe me. But the

01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:00.640
[Amit Varma]: point is that if any of us were to pitch this idea to a radio station or a mainstream house

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:05.440
[Amit Varma]: and say, hey, I'll do something like this, and they would laugh us out of the room, because

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:10.080
[Amit Varma]: it's not a safe option. The assumption is we are catering to short attention span, 20

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:14.400
[Amit Varma]: minute karo and whatever, and they're not even going to try that. And that and that's

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:19.480
[Amit Varma]: why it's it's kind of a delightful time where those means of production are now available

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:25.240
[Amit Varma]: to all. And I don't think this has even been explored to the extent that it can be where,

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, you of course got newsletters and blogs and all of that happening. Yeah, but

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.920
[Guest]: I think there's a lot more scope for independent voices.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:35.560
[Guest]: So we live in a multimedia environment, Amit. And it's growing by the day. I think technology

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:39.440
[Guest]: is driving our lives. Yeah. And especially in the consumption of media. And you know,

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.880
[Guest]: we talked about what for journalists to remain relevant. Some of the other things that come

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:51.640
[Guest]: to my mind, just to hark back a little, is, you know, you can have great access to performers

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:57.200
[Guest]: and therefore you get an exclusivity. That's a huge advantage if you can manage that. The

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:03.200
[Guest]: other is, conventionally in the media or in journalism is called scoops, you get privileged

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:10.000
[Guest]: information. So one is, of course, having access to Dhoni. You know, Dhoni is a recluse.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.600
[Guest]: If you have access to him and you get Dhoni to speak to you, even if he's talking about

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:19.040
[Guest]: his dog or his dogs or his cars, there is a story, people are waiting to read it, you

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:26.960
[Guest]: know. And if you get privileged information, you get scoops. Why did Virat Kohli suddenly

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:33.120
[Guest]: announce his retirement from T20 captaincy? Now, you know, the reasons have come, but

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:38.240
[Guest]: if you have privileged information as to what was the trigger, what really transpired, then

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:44.440
[Guest]: maybe, you know, not maybe, you will certainly have a lot of people reading you and wanting

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:50.080
[Guest]: to read you further. And that need not be put in purple prose. You don't need purple

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.600
[Guest]: prose for this kind of information. So this is one dimension also, which has got a lot

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:59.360
[Guest]: of, which gets a lot of weightage today in media, whichever way it comes from. So there

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:05.840
[Guest]: are, you know, while I do say that, yes, it's getting tougher and tougher, but if you get

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.880
[Guest]: the old stereotype of a cricket writer being somebody who's carrying Renan, you know, the

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:15.640
[Guest]: thesaurus with him and coming up with these wonderful turns of phrase and great three

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:19.960
[Guest]: paras leading into the main story, those three paras could be all fluff. And then you get

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:25.880
[Guest]: down to the story. I think that thing has kind of passed, you know, it's become passé.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:31.240
[Guest]: And now you have to look at other areas. You also have to be conscious of the fact that

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:36.880
[Guest]: attention span of people is very, very low. So what do you do to hold attention? You know,

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:42.120
[Guest]: and then there is the, it's a very interesting situation. If your attention span is low,

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.200
[Guest]: that means people are spending two, three minutes, four minute reads, like you see on

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:50.840
[Guest]: many websites, three minute read, four minute read, it comes to you, you know. And then

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:55.440
[Guest]: there are, there's a proliferation of the long reads. You know, you've got five, seven

01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:01.760
[Guest]: minute podcasts, and you've also got like the seen and the unseen, which are extensive

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:08.280
[Guest]: extended podcasts, which also people follow very diligently. So all kinds of things are

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:12.720
[Guest]: happening today in the media. It's a very exciting space to be in. But you have to be

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.840
[Guest]: also, you know, clear that you'll be sometimes swimming against the tide till you find your

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:24.720
[Guest]: bearings again. Sometimes you'll go, you'll clear distances without any hindrance. And

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.920
[Guest]: then again, you'll run into a problem. This is something that is going to happen for the

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.840
[Guest]: rest of our lives as I see it.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:33.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you'll run against the tide till you succeed, and then everyone will copy you and

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:38.240
[Amit Varma]: when copying you won't work. And by the way, that short attention span, as I must again

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:43.000
[Amit Varma]: say, it's, it's a misconception, but it's a misconception in an interesting way, in

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.880
[Amit Varma]: the sense that I would not divide people into categories of people with short attention

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:52.600
[Amit Varma]: spans and people with long attention spans. I would simply say that we all contain multitudes,

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:56.960
[Amit Varma]: right? So there are times many times where I have a short attention span. But there are

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.520
[Amit Varma]: times where I want to really dig in deep, I'm open to the immersive experience, when

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:07.760
[Amit Varma]: I have that long attention span. And it really depends on the incentives you give me to shift

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:13.120
[Amit Varma]: from oneself to the other. And I think the more good content and the more rewarding content

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:18.240
[Amit Varma]: there is out there, it can really help like I'm sure there might be someone who loves

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.160
[Amit Varma]: history but thinks he has a short attention span, and then listens to say Dan Collins

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.880
[Amit Varma]: Hardcore History where every episode is five hours, and then they are changed forever,

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:30.120
[Amit Varma]: you can kind of shift between them. Before we get back to tracing your personal journey,

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:34.120
[Amit Varma]: and this is a digressive show. So it's a feature, not a bug that we move all around the place.

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:38.640
[Amit Varma]: But before we get back to your personal journey, a general question on journalism, which is

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.640
[Amit Varma]: that it's my sense, and I know you agree with me, and you've just kind of elaborated on

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.480
[Amit Varma]: a number of other criticisms of mainstream media today. But it's my sense that over the

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:53.080
[Amit Varma]: last 20 years, a way in which as consumers, we discover media, filter media, consume media

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.960
[Amit Varma]: has changed completely. And mainstream organizations haven't figured this out at all. Now, you've

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:02.360
[Amit Varma]: been someone who's been the editorial head of mainstream organizations, editor of midday

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:06.680
[Amit Varma]: and editor at Times of India. If you were in one of those organizations today, like

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:12.760
[Amit Varma]: what I see in those organizations is that there is this desperate thirst to find the

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:17.800
[Amit Varma]: latest Twitter trend and do a story on it. Find what Republic TV is screaming about and

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:23.320
[Amit Varma]: do a story on it. And it's just become that race to the bottom, that race to cater to

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:28.280
[Amit Varma]: what is immediate. Now, we know that there is more happening there in terms of how we

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:35.160
[Amit Varma]: are consuming things, right? So, if you were running one of those companies today, if TOI

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:39.280
[Amit Varma]: was to say, make you the editor, which would be a great idea and say, okay, Ayaz, build

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:44.240
[Amit Varma]: a Times of India for the year 2035 and start now, you know, what are the things that you

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.440
[Amit Varma]: would do? What comes to mind?

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:51.720
[Guest]: So I would, you know, first of all, I would look at hiring people who are, you know, less

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:56.360
[Guest]: conditioned to just thinking along very structured patterns, because that has really been hit

01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:02.880
[Guest]: for the sakes. You know, I think, partly the problem is of the, for instance, a newspaper,

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:09.640
[Guest]: the cycle of the paper is a problem. Today, news is consumed 24 by 7 into 365. So, a paper

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:15.600
[Guest]: which is put to bed at 12, 11, 11.30, 12 midnight around that time, and comes next morning to

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:21.880
[Guest]: your house at 6.37. In six and a half hours, a lot has happened, which you're not going

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.760
[Guest]: to find available. While when you switch on your cell phone, you'll have these alerts

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:30.600
[Guest]: which are already there on your phone saying, you know, news breaks and stuff like that.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.320
[Guest]: And you always get this feeling or the sense that I'm a little cheated. You know, I haven't

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:40.320
[Guest]: got the, why am I reading the newspaper, if I'm going to get no information as to what

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:46.480
[Guest]: has happened in the last six, six and a half, seven hours. So the need for instant gratification

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:55.560
[Guest]: and consumption of news has completely defined how one consumes news. And therefore, newspapers

01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:02.240
[Guest]: in that sense are not fulfilling that need. Where newspapers can fulfil, what need can

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:09.440
[Guest]: they fulfil? They can be far more explanatory, they can be far more analytical, very more

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:16.880
[Guest]: features driven, I think, very good interviews with, you know, relevant people. But where

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:23.840
[Guest]: the instant news is concerned, I think they are, it's gone, you know, it's history. Including

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:34.680
[Guest]: even television, you know, you had a 9pm show, is not as fulfilling as a Twitter update,

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:41.680
[Guest]: which comes to me, I mean, Twitter is your fastest source of news as of now. And therefore,

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:46.480
[Guest]: you always will feel that everything else is behind times. So if I have to look at a

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:53.440
[Guest]: creating a media setup heading into 2035, say, first of all, it has to be multimedia,

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:59.160
[Guest]: it can't be one. And how one dovetails into the other, how, you know, they kind of intertwine

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:06.080
[Guest]: and then they end up, they blend all kinds of functions and reach the final consumer

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:12.760
[Guest]: or the consumer finally, is really the challenge. And how do you reach out using a mix of social

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:21.560
[Guest]: media plus old format media, radio and television? Not everybody has all these attributes available

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:25.800
[Guest]: in a media organisation. Those which are only dependent on newspapers, I think are going

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:32.840
[Guest]: to be less and less relevant as time goes by. I mean, you know, I mean, I spend a lot

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.280
[Guest]: of time in Alibaug, where I don't get the newspaper. By the time the newspaper comes

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.360
[Guest]: to my house at 9.30, 10, I don't want it. I've already read all the newspapers on my

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:48.040
[Guest]: mobile or on my laptop. In Bombay, when I'm in Mumbai, I do get the newspapers at home.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.600
[Guest]: The good thing about newspapers still is that if you're getting them delivered to your house,

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.920
[Guest]: you don't stop them because you don't even know when the guy delivered it, it's there,

01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:01.200
[Guest]: it's fine. And there's also a certain sense of, you know, psychological dependency that

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:07.480
[Guest]: everything is right with the world, my newspapers come to me at 6.30. But going ahead, I think

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:14.920
[Guest]: that media organisations will have to seriously look at how they reach the formats, not one

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:21.440
[Guest]: format, the formats in which they reach the consumer because all of us are consuming multimedia,

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.400
[Guest]: the experience is multimedia. You know, you might watch the match. If you're watching

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:32.560
[Guest]: a cricket match, you might watch the pre-run session on TV. You have to step out, you'll

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.920
[Guest]: keep updating yourself on what's happening on the score on the cell phone, you suddenly

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:42.480
[Guest]: find there's an alert that somebody's reached a century or taken a hat trick, you'll immediately

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:47.320
[Guest]: search on your cell phone if there is a highlights package, which is 30 seconds or 40 seconds,

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:51.400
[Guest]: which tells you what has happened. So you don't want to be behind in terms of knowledge

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.320
[Guest]: and information than anybody else. Also, we are social animals, you reach your destination,

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.160
[Guest]: you meet your colleague or your friend or girlfriend or whatever, and there has to be

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:04.640
[Guest]: some conversation. You know, if some political leader has been arrested, you know, immediately

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:10.880
[Guest]: that becomes a opening of a conversation or a dialogue. I say you can't be, you know,

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.040
[Guest]: I don't know about this at all. It can happen, it happens all the time, but you don't want

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.560
[Guest]: to be in that situation. In today's day and age, the way we consume media, we want to

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:24.560
[Guest]: be on top of the situation. So for that, I think news organizations or media houses will

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:34.840
[Guest]: have to be, I mean, electric heeled into gathering information and disseminating it. It has to

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:41.240
[Guest]: be almost a, you know, simultaneous process. It comes in and it goes out. The swiftness,

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:46.240
[Guest]: the speed and the rapidity and exercising those controls, you know, if you're a media

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.320
[Guest]: organization. If I'm an independent, as they call an independent journalist who's on Twitter,

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:56.760
[Guest]: look, we are talking here, an accident takes place on the road where your apartment is

01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:02.680
[Guest]: located and somebody with a cell phone is the first to capture it on camera and put

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:06.920
[Guest]: it on Twitter. By the time the news organization reporters come, it'll be three hours, two

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.760
[Guest]: hours, one hour, we don't know. The news is already...

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:14.080
[Amit Varma]: Maybe like four different narratives about it. Doctored videos from Bangladesh purporting

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.800
[Amit Varma]: to be this location.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:21.480
[Guest]: And if you want the credibility of your organization or the brand value of organization to carry

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:29.400
[Guest]: your, the gravitas of your news gathering through, then you have to be, I think speed

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:32.280
[Guest]: is now becoming of the essence.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:36.260
[Amit Varma]: The sort of counterpoint to this is like, of course, I think this might be one of those

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:40.100
[Amit Varma]: cases where I think, was it Naipaul who famously said or Churchill who famously said that whatever

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:46.440
[Amit Varma]: you say of India, the opposite is also true. And here I would say that, yeah, you know,

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:49.680
[Amit Varma]: speed being of the essence is of course there because information is a commodity. If you

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.960
[Amit Varma]: aren't giving it immediately, then it's kind of redundant. The person already knows. But

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:59.920
[Amit Varma]: the other way is that there also, I think, needs to be a tariff in our coverage. I produce

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:04.280
[Amit Varma]: this other show called Brave New World hosted by Vasant Dhar where he chatted with Jonathan

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:08.320
[Amit Varma]: Hyde and Jonathan Hyde made a great observation there. He said that, listen, you might think

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:14.400
[Amit Varma]: that we are in a world where all the information from all of human history is there at our

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:20.120
[Amit Varma]: disposal, right? But the truth is that most people are consuming at this very moment,

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:24.160
[Amit Varma]: what was produced in the last three days. The entirety of our consumption is something

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:29.960
[Amit Varma]: that was produced in the last three days. And therefore, what we have are people who

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:35.560
[Amit Varma]: are all the time buffeted by information, but always shallow, always ignorant, you know,

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:40.560
[Amit Varma]: and which is why your book, by the way, is such a fine service, because, yeah, I've just

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:45.200
[Amit Varma]: been through that 50 or 75 years. Yeah, and it's and it's fascinating. And I and I want

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.480
[Amit Varma]: people to pick up your book not to kind of skim through it while they're doing five other

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:53.960
[Amit Varma]: things, but sit back quietly and read it and immerse themselves in it, which I think they

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.760
[Amit Varma]: will, because I think there's a hunger for that too.

01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:59.960
[Guest]: So I've tried to create a narrative, which is fine. What you're saying is right. But

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:04.440
[Guest]: I think both things happen simultaneously. For instance, you know, I love to read the

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:10.160
[Guest]: Wisden Almanac. It comes once a year. And I make sure that I get it and I read it like

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:15.000
[Guest]: from cover to cover. You know, and it's a periodical, it comes, but it doesn't mean

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.160
[Guest]: I stop consuming cricket coverage otherwise, or any other coverage. So both things work

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:27.120
[Guest]: simultaneously. But in in saying that I savour Wisden Cricket Almanac, I don't want to be

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:35.400
[Guest]: left behind on my current, you know, information, those gaps to be met. You know, I can't say

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.280
[Guest]: it really doesn't matter if I don't get that information, because I can wait a year later

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:44.080
[Guest]: and find out what really happened. So Wisden will give you a great perspective on everything

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:50.160
[Guest]: that has happened in the preceding year. But if I'm not, you know, with it, while things

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:56.640
[Guest]: are unfolding, and, you know, news, as they say, newspapers is history on the run, you

01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:01.400
[Guest]: know, and it keeps getting revised all the time, a lot of stories get junked. We don't

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:05.000
[Guest]: even know what happens to those stories, you know, what is today's scoop might be in the

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.480
[Guest]: dustbin tomorrow. Because the effective follow up has shown that it was rubbish, or there's

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:14.360
[Guest]: not been any follow up, or actually, it was a trifling, which is played up, these things

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:22.120
[Guest]: happen. But if I'm not in that loop, then I might feel a little left behind, or a lot

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:28.240
[Guest]: left behind by a lot. So it also depends on the temperament, the age group, the social

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:34.920
[Guest]: milieu that you're in, all of that matters. The consumption of media is not straight laced,

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:40.320
[Guest]: you know, it's very, very, very kaleidoscopic. You know, all kinds of people look for different

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:44.760
[Guest]: things from what they want from the world, what they expect from the media.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:48.080
[Amit Varma]: And the delightful thing is, it's an expanding kaleidoscope, like the problem with media

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:53.440
[Amit Varma]: houses now is that the future is unknown unknowns. It's not even known unknowns. You know that

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.120
[Amit Varma]: there's a problem, you know what the problem is, so you put a team, you solve it. But here

01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:01.200
[Amit Varma]: you don't even know what it's going to look like tomorrow. And just for those of my readers

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:05.680
[Amit Varma]: who might not have heard of the Wizarding Cricketers, Almanac, I'll quickly explain

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.960
[Amit Varma]: what it is. Back in the day, there's this, you know, revered British company called Wisden,

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:13.720
[Amit Varma]: which used to, which still brings out something called the Wizarding Cricketers Almanac, which

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:18.520
[Amit Varma]: comes every year, which basically has all the scorecards of the year and all the info

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:23.320
[Amit Varma]: of the year. And you can read that on, you know, December 31st. And by the end of it,

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:27.040
[Amit Varma]: you'll know everything that happened that year. It's a fat book. All cricket writers

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:32.640
[Amit Varma]: aspire to writing for it. I finally did in, I wrote for a couple of those editions. And

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:37.120
[Amit Varma]: then my byline, this is an amusing story. Our mutual friend Anand Vasu, I think complained

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:42.080
[Amit Varma]: to me once, that he wrote for them a year after me. And they were just going by alphabetical

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:46.600
[Amit Varma]: order and Indian writer with A. So instead of putting on a piece that he wrote, they

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:52.360
[Amit Varma]: accidentally put my byline somehow. And I never even knew. So poor Anand was really

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.360
[Unknown]: upset that, yeah, Wisden.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:58.400
[Guest]: Yeah, it's in the Bible. You don't find a mention in the Bible. That's terrible.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:02.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah. So I can imagine the shock and horror when he got the copy and he went to

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:08.560
[Guest]: the hospital. And also, you know, Wisden is still, he's got a very lofty, you know.

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:11.560
[Guest]: It's like the MCC of cricket journalism.

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:15.760
[Guest]: But also what has changed in cricket writing, especially, but in sports writing by and large

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:22.320
[Guest]: is that the internet gives you access to information that, you know, at the click of a mouse. While

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:26.960
[Guest]: earlier, I mean, when I started writing on cricket, I used to maintain a scorecard in

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:32.200
[Guest]: the press box, you know, and if somebody hit a four, then you put, you write down the number

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:37.320
[Guest]: four, and then you describe elegant cover drive by so and so. So it's that when you

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:43.120
[Guest]: wrote your story, you remembered it, you know. Nowadays, nobody takes notes. It's all available

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:49.680
[Guest]: on, you might take notes sparingly, just to keep yourself, you know, filled in as to when

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:54.440
[Guest]: you write your story, what all you should focus on. You don't have to scurry around

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:58.740
[Guest]: looking for, making associations with the past because it's all available at the click

01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:06.320
[Guest]: of a mouse. You know, if I have to, somebody, Veeru Sehwag zits a triple hundred in, in

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:11.280
[Guest]: the first triple hundred that he's made in 2005 against Pakistan, and the first Indian

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:15.040
[Guest]: to do it ever. Now, where do I run around trying to find out who all have made triple

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:20.120
[Guest]: hundreds, how many balls, how many fours, it's all available. So there is a certain

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:25.280
[Guest]: ease of gathering information which has happened, but it also creates its own complication because

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:30.840
[Guest]: there's so much of it that you have to be really smart in how you select the information.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:35.520
[Amit Varma]: Also, I remember one of the things that troubled me when I started touring around cricket first

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:40.520
[Amit Varma]: with Wisden and then with Crickinfo. And again, to complete that almanac story, Wisden came

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:45.120
[Amit Varma]: to India in 2001 with a magazine called Wisden Cricket Monthly, which I joined. We started

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:51.080
[Amit Varma]: a website called Wisden.com which bought Crickinfo and subsequently Crickinfo was bought by ESPN

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:55.860
[Amit Varma]: and then another Wisden.com, which was out of the picture, then made a comeback later.

01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:59.320
[Amit Varma]: And it's a very complicated story. But one of the things I remember traveling to test

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:04.160
[Amit Varma]: matches all over the place is that in the press box, and this really disturbed me when

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:08.440
[Amit Varma]: I first saw this, in the press box, nobody would watch the cricket. Yeah, because they

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:13.480
[Amit Varma]: know that you will get all the information. You won't get all the information anyway.

01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.960
[Amit Varma]: So I'm watching every ball, right? I'm soaking it in also partly because I'm a new writer

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:21.920
[Amit Varma]: at that time. And it's really exciting for me. But nobody would watch the cricket. And

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:26.760
[Amit Varma]: I would be like, what kind of press box is this? You know, and, you know, once I once

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:31.800
[Amit Varma]: in Mohali, I noticed one guy sitting behind me very intently watching every ball, taking

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:35.880
[Amit Varma]: notes, constantly typing things. And I was damn impressed. And then the next day, I think

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.040
[Amit Varma]: he was either arrested or thrown out of the press box because he was actually working

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:45.960
[Amit Varma]: for a bookie syndicate. Oh, and he was because the image on TV comes a couple of split seconds,

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:53.120
[Amit Varma]: you know, he was quickly feeding the information, you know, in a split second hitting whatever

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:59.220
[Amit Varma]: button he has to hit. So it was really amusing. And I remember I was very pissed off because

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:04.400
[Amit Varma]: I had had to fight like a maniac to get my press pass for that particular test match.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.160
[Amit Varma]: In those days, these, you know, Crickinfo was a new kid on the block. And these guys

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:13.960
[Guest]: would keep troubling us. Yeah. And what is Crickinfo? Yeah, so I had to run around for

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.640
[Amit Varma]: a whole day to get a press pass. And this guy, this Firang guy got just got it immediately

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.920
[Guest]: very easily. Yeah. And then he's doing this thing, but he was watching every ball.

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:28.680
[Guest]: So there are best practices and there are not such good practices of, you know, covering

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:33.400
[Guest]: an event. I've seen people doze off in the press box and like doze off, doze off and

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:38.440
[Guest]: snore and wake up two hours later, not having watched the match for that period. And then,

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:42.200
[Guest]: of course, they're writing their stories and running around trying to get information.

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:50.520
[Guest]: You know, ultimately, if it's stringing together 8-10 paras or 15 paras, that's not the challenge.

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:55.120
[Guest]: Anybody with even basic skills can do it, you know. But it's how you watch the match

01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:00.720
[Guest]: and what you… There's a sense of enjoyment or even sometimes non-enjoyment which might

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:06.040
[Guest]: come through, you know. But the writing should be enjoyable. I think it makes a difference

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:11.980
[Amit Varma]: over the years. Yes. Like, you know, I might watch a match intently and you might not.

01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:15.480
[Amit Varma]: And we could write reports which are very similar. But over the years, the person who's

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.760
[Amit Varma]: watching the match intently will just have greater, deeper insight.

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:25.320
[Guest]: This is my 43rd year in journalism and in sports writing. So it's not that I've watched

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:29.360
[Guest]: every match with the same intensity. It can happen. Sometimes there's such a dull passage

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.840
[Guest]: of play. And, you know, you walk out of the press box, there's some guys talking and you

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.920
[Guest]: get into a debate on some other subject, you know. And then it's been half an hour, 45

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:44.200
[Guest]: minutes, you go back in and you pick up the threads and… But interestingly, you mention

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:47.960
[Guest]: about this guy, somebody sitting there and taking notes. So one of my… It's not about

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:54.980
[Guest]: a bookie. One of my earliest… My earliest experience of being on tour was in Pakistan.

01:27:54.980 --> 01:28:00.400
[Guest]: So we were in the press box at various grounds, Lahore, Karachi, Faisalabad, part of the Ding

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:05.080
[Guest]: Bang which was, you know… And there must have been maybe about eight, nine journalists

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:11.040
[Guest]: from India, not 80, 90 as it is today. India, Pakistan would be 80, 90 journalists otherwise.

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:17.200
[Guest]: And there would be a guy constantly in the press box who was meeting all of us every

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:24.560
[Guest]: day and being, you know, more, like, friendlier than one would expect. And then suddenly this

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:30.680
[Guest]: buzz went around in the… Amongst us, amongst the Indian journalists. Ye hai kaun? Nobody

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:35.320
[Guest]: seemed to know who he was. No Pakistani journalist knew who he was. You know, most of the Pakistani

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:40.080
[Guest]: journalists, we knew which papers… Nobody knew who the hell he was. Then somebody said,

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:46.120
[Guest]: ye intelligence ka aadmi hai. He's keeping a watch on all the Indian journalists. So

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:50.400
[Guest]: that became… Then we started kind of distancing ourselves, you know, from him. But he used

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:55.880
[Guest]: to be there every match. And finally, one fine day, we found that he had stopped coming

01:28:55.880 --> 01:29:02.120
[Guest]: one match. So, where has he gone? We all got a little perplexed. Where the hell has he

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:05.960
[Guest]: gone? So, we found out from the guys who were in charge of the press box. And I said, this

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:10.360
[Guest]: guy used to be there, over here. He's no longer to be seen. He's saying, haan usko

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:15.440
[Guest]: hum log ne bhaar phek diya. Kya ho gaya? He never had a pass. He used to always say, I'm

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:21.920
[Guest]: an Indian journalist and come along into the press box. Now, you know, whether he was from

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:25.600
[Guest]: the intelligence or not, I have no idea. But I'm saying these kind of crazy things happen

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:32.280
[Guest]: in press boxes. Maybe he was just a guy who… See, in those days there was very little security.

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:37.200
[Guest]: It wasn't as sanitized and sterilized, you know, the environment as it is now. So, people

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:41.200
[Guest]: used to hop in and out of press boxes. And we thought he's one of the Pakistani journalists.

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:45.840
[Guest]: Then we found that he's not a Pakistani journalist. Then, is he an ISI or some other

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:50.280
[Guest]: agent, some, you know, intelligence fellow? But he wasn't that. He was some vagabond

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:54.160
[Guest]: who was getting the best seat in the town, best seat in the match, come and sit in the

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:58.160
[Guest]: press box. Tell everybody he's part of the Indian journalist team and whenever he was

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.960
[Guest]: with us, say he's with the Pakistanis. Something like that.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:01.960
[Guest]: Mr. Natwarlal.

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:02.960
[Guest]: Mr. Natwarlal.

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:07.200
[Amit Varma]: Must have kind of honed his skills gate crashing weddings and this is sort of…

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:10.280
[Guest]: It's not funny, you know, the number of people who used to gate crash. Nowadays, it's far

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:16.400
[Guest]: more organized. Of course, in the other countries, like England and Australia, it was far more

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:20.880
[Guest]: regimented. You couldn't just, you know, the system of ticketing system for the press box

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:26.320
[Guest]: also was… But even the West Indies, I went there in 1989, you'd find all kinds of people,

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:31.040
[Guest]: you know. The West Indies in that sense is much like India, you know, who you know, who's

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:34.600
[Amit Varma]: the guy who can let you in and stuff like that.

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:39.400
[Amit Varma]: I remember when I went to Pakistan in 2006 and I was covering that tour for The Guardian

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:44.360
[Amit Varma]: but also filing pieces for Crick Info, but also writing pieces for The Wall Street Journal.

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:49.000
[Amit Varma]: I did a couple of op-eds from there, I think. And I remember at one point, I went to on

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.760
[Amit Varma]: an off day from the cricket, I went to interview an economist and I went to his, you know,

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:57.680
[Amit Varma]: flashy bungalow and all that. And at one point during the conversation, he said that, I must

01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:01.240
[Amit Varma]: tell you, Amit, you know, you called me up earlier and all of that, but I must tell you

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:05.480
[Amit Varma]: that my phone is tapped. So, I said, really, your phone is tapped? And he said, I must

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:09.080
[Amit Varma]: tell you another thing, Amit, your phone is also tapped. And I was like, what are you

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:13.080
[Unknown]: talking about? And he's saying, all of you bloody Indian journalists, they are listening

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:17.320
[Unknown]: to every word you say, which is incredibly likely.

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:25.040
[Amit Varma]: So I met a gentleman called Murali there, who was the Hindu correspondent in Islamabad.

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:29.960
[Amit Varma]: And Murali told me an interesting thing. He said that there, with regard to journalists,

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:38.080
[Amit Varma]: the two countries have a policy of exact reciprocation, in the sense that if a Pakistani journalist

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:43.520
[Amit Varma]: in New Delhi has his fridge stolen, the next day, the Indian journalist in Islamabad will

01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:47.960
[Amit Varma]: have his fridge stolen. So it's the exact reciprocity and that's official policy.

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:52.760
[Guest]: Even at the diplomatic level, one undersecretary is sacked here, the next day, there's the

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:57.920
[Guest]: undersecretary who's sent back from either country. So it's a tit for tat spy versus

01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:00.200
[Amit Varma]: spy situation from Mad Comics.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:03.840
[Amit Varma]: Quite delightful. Even the India-Pakistan dynamic is something we must discuss as we

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:07.040
[Amit Varma]: go on to talking about cricket. But before that, we'll get back to talking about your

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.920
[Amit Varma]: personal journey. And before that, we'll take a quick commercial break.

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:18.560
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:24.320
[Amit Varma]: heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009 and

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:28.920
[Amit Varma]: became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me, and I feel I

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:34.600
[Amit Varma]: was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:39.040
[Amit Varma]: to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well,

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:44.200
[Amit Varma]: that phase in my life ended for various reasons, and now it is time to revive it. Only now,

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:51.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:55.840
[Amit Varma]: where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy. I'll write about some of

[Amit Varma]: India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com. Thank you.

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:24.520
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Ayaz Memon about his life about

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:29.280
[Amit Varma]: his journey about his wonderful new book Indian Innings. And in a sense, you know, I'd be

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:33.600
[Amit Varma]: perfectly happy to call this episode Ayaz Innings. I won't do that because that sounds

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:37.520
[Amit Varma]: weird. But let's go back to your personal life. You've discussed your sort of early

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:41.640
[Amit Varma]: love for cricket, you know, watch the match at the Brebon, you remember all the names,

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:45.880
[Amit Varma]: you remember the scorecard, you know, 71 is a big deal, you're reading K.N Prabhu and

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:50.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, all those inspiring reports come. From there, at this point in time, how do

01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:56.040
[Amit Varma]: you see yourself? Like what what is your conception of yourself? Ki main yeh banunga? And how

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:58.200
[Amit Varma]: does that path veer towards cricket writing?

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:02.000
[Guest]: So Amit, I mean, if you're growing up in the 60s and 70s, there were not too many options

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.240
[Guest]: academically. When you look at what things are today, you have to be BA, BCom, BSc. If

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:12.560
[Guest]: you're doing graduation, if you had the stamina, and the financial stamina, also, you go on

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:18.280
[Guest]: to do your master's. Outside of that, the vocational courses were engineering, medicine

01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:23.840
[Guest]: and so on, limited. You couldn't have also juxtapositions of curriculum, you know, you

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:29.480
[Guest]: couldn't do BSc with also literature, it was not possible. My father was a lawyer. And

01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:34.600
[Guest]: there was a big demand in my kind of family group and all. When I was growing up, are

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:40.240
[Guest]: you going to be a lawyer? As it used to be in those in homes in those days. And that

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:45.440
[Guest]: kind of created this situation, whatever happens, I don't want to be a lawyer. You know, so

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:49.720
[Guest]: when I was in school, I thought I'll be an engineer. That was my hope and dream to be

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:50.840
[Amit Varma]: an engineer.

01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.360
[Amit Varma]: That was your rebellion to be an engineer.

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:57.480
[Guest]: Yeah, that was my rebellion. And I look back, it was such a, you know, it was some such

01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:05.320
[Guest]: a stupid decision. So, I got into science. In school also, I took science last two years,

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:10.840
[Guest]: senior Cambridge was the school finishing program, but into college and I took science

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:16.880
[Guest]: and I realised that to be an engineer, you had no trigonometry, you had no higher physics,

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:23.240
[Guest]: which was like, you know, facing Malcolm Marshall's bouncers, as it turned out. And I was not

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:30.120
[Guest]: equipped at all to do engineering and whatever else. So, I switched and I did economics.

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:37.080
[Guest]: And I studied economics, I passed with honours just about, and then subsequently, and by

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:44.760
[Guest]: that time, my father had passed away. So, then I got into law. You know, ironically,

01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:50.080
[Guest]: I got into law, I did my law from government law college. But by that time, I was consumed

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:57.320
[Guest]: by sport and cricket. And I was also interested in journalism. So, while I was studying, I

01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:02.520
[Guest]: was doing, I think, my first or second year of law, yeah, first year, I joined a journalism

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:08.320
[Guest]: class in Xavier's College of Journalism. Evening classes, we used to have 6.30 to 8.30 or something

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:15.200
[Guest]: like that. And while I was there, there was an ex-basketball player from Western Railway

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:20.920
[Guest]: and I think he was also in the India Reserves, Javed Akhtar, who had also joined the Xavier's

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:28.400
[Guest]: class, Xavier's College, and he was working with Sportsweek. So, he said, we've got a

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:33.880
[Guest]: vacancy, why don't you join now? I said, you know, I'm doing law. And he said, you don't

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:40.120
[Guest]: like it? Six months later, if you're going for exams and all, don't do it. So, in 1979

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:46.600
[Guest]: is when I got into Sportsweek. That was my first brush with journalism, so to speak,

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:54.040
[Guest]: getting into the newsroom. And the first assignment which I got was to go and watch the Jubilee

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:59.040
[Guest]: match, India versus England, which was a memorable match in many ways. Vishwanath was the captain,

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.040
[Guest]: not Gavaskar.

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.040
[Guest]: And Mike Braley.

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:07.680
[Guest]: And Mike Braley. And, you know, Vishwanath, everybody remembers calling back Bob Taylor,

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:13.280
[Guest]: you know, catch, which the umpire upheld, catch behind. And Vishwanath consulted Kirmani.

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:18.160
[Guest]: Kirmani said no, and Bob Taylor was called back. And Bob Taylor and Botham had a long

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:25.320
[Guest]: partnership. And then, of course, Botham bowled us out twice, both innings. He was the best

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:31.880
[Guest]: all-rounder in the world then. And England won the match. But my job was to do what was

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.720
[Guest]: popularly known as side stories. Somebody else was doing the match report for Midday.

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:40.600
[Guest]: Midday was a very new newspaper then. It had started in 1979. There was a lot of excitement

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:46.240
[Guest]: in the small, meagre newsroom that Midday had in those days. It was a small paper, but

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:50.320
[Guest]: lots of fun. And then there was Sportsweek magazine, which was also from the same stable.

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:56.080
[Guest]: So I was doing side lights and side stories. But I got a place in the press box, which

01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:01.080
[Guest]: is right behind the bowler's arm. And, you know, I had never seen a cricket match from

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:08.320
[Guest]: that vantage situation. And I immediately got a job offer from them. I had got a job

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:13.400
[Guest]: offer and I realized I'm being paid to watch cricket. And what could be better? So, you

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:19.000
[Guest]: know, law, the ambitions for pursuing a law degree went out of the window for a while.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:26.240
[Guest]: I did resume it later and completed my graduation. But I said, this is like, you know, this is

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:31.280
[Guest]: the best thing that can happen to me. And I was being paid 350 rupees, but that really

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.720
[Guest]: didn't matter because I was there sitting behind the bowler's arm. And, you know, you

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:39.800
[Guest]: see if you're sitting in the press box, there's Dilip Sardesai who comes in or Bapu Nadkarni

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:45.000
[Guest]: or some of these old-timers. And if you were lucky in a domestic match, which we also,

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.280
[Guest]: you know, we'd go and attend, Gavaskar would come up and sit in what was the committee

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:55.240
[Guest]: box or the selector's box. The players' box was below the dressing room. And those days,

01:38:55.240 --> 01:39:01.040
[Guest]: it was not as secure the environment. So, you could, you know, you could hop across

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:05.080
[Guest]: and say, I want to speak to so-and-so player and maybe you would get a chance that you

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:12.120
[Guest]: could do it. So, that kind of association with the game and the access just won me over.

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:16.920
[Guest]: And I said, whatever it is, this is what I'm going to do.

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:21.360
[Amit Varma]: Getting paid to do what you love is such an incredible privilege. You used the phrase

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:25.560
[Amit Varma]: when you were talking about how you studied economics, you said you could just about passed

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.840
[Amit Varma]: with honors, which sounds to me much like, you know, a batsman saying, I barely managed

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:35.640
[Amit Varma]: to reach my 200, what is just about passed with honors. But here's sort of my next question

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:39.120
[Amit Varma]: that today, if I want to be a cricket writer, say I'm 20 years old, I want to be a cricket

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:44.520
[Amit Varma]: writer. I have all the models in the world to emulate, to figure out who are my stylistic

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:50.400
[Amit Varma]: heroes, what are the best practices in journalism, and blah, blah, blah. I have this whole smorgasbord

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.040
[Amit Varma]: of influences which I can pick from. In your case, that would not have been the case. In

01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:58.320
[Amit Varma]: the sense, okay, you're reading Prabhu and you're reading Hendrix and you're reading

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:03.800
[Amit Varma]: a handful of people, but it is a handful of people. How did you then form your conception

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:08.680
[Amit Varma]: of what good writing is? Like, what do you want to write? Like, what do you tell yourself?

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:13.680
[Amit Varma]: When you look back on your early self, was there a period of time before you found your

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:18.520
[Amit Varma]: own voice, so to say, or it just came naturally? How did your values sort of evolve in that

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:19.520
[Guest]: period of time?

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:24.560
[Guest]: No, I think what helped me, I did find my voice after a little while, you know. I mean,

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:29.240
[Guest]: as happens with everybody, you try and be more, you imagine what you are and you try

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:34.160
[Guest]: and be that. Well, that may not be your true voice, so to speak. And it comes with a little

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:39.480
[Guest]: experience and it comes with a little discipline as a writer. You get into a certain drill

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:44.400
[Guest]: in terms of information gathering and then, of course, how you articulate and express

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:49.220
[Guest]: it. That takes a little while, unless you're a born natural. That's a different matter.

01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:55.480
[Guest]: But what helped me, I think, when I look back is, I read a lot about cricket and I was generally

01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:01.080
[Guest]: very interested in books. And, you know, while I read a lot of fiction and etc., while growing

01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:06.560
[Guest]: up in my teenage years, early 20s, I also read a lot of cricket, from the Cardus books

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:13.320
[Guest]: to Beyond the Boundary and so many others, including my cricketing years, Ajit Vadekar,

01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:18.520
[Guest]: Tiger's Tale, Pathodi, Sunny Days when it first came out, 1976, I think. These were

01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:24.640
[Guest]: all books that I consumed and it just made me so much more familiar with players and,

01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:29.480
[Guest]: you know, their points of view and their lives and stuff. I was also a very avid follower

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:36.000
[Guest]: of cricket in the British Council Library. I would go every week, maybe twice a week

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.480
[Guest]: or thrice a week, just to read the British newspapers during their cricket season, their

01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:46.960
[Guest]: summer, the English summer. Because that, you know, the British papers would have a

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:53.360
[Guest]: half-page story or a match report and some of the better-known writers one had got, come

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:57.720
[Guest]: to know of, would be there. The county scores, I would devour them, you know, rather than

01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:03.000
[Guest]: wait for Playfair Cricket Annual with the, you know, the consolidated scores and all

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.440
[Guest]: to come, I would be always visiting British Council. And therefore, I developed a certain

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:13.280
[Guest]: liking for certain kinds of writers. You know, Alan Ross was one of those writers I really

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.560
[Guest]: enjoyed reading. Jack Fingalton.

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:16.560
[Guest]: I love Jack Fingalton.

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:21.440
[Guest]: Jack Fingalton was fabulous. There was Ray Robinson, whose style was very interesting

01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:29.000
[Guest]: because he was not lyrical like a Prabhu or a Cardis, but he was very business-like, but

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.920
[Guest]: very factual. And he, you know, the expression was also very sound. And he, you know, as

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:41.080
[Guest]: they say, he would, each para you could, was leading into something more. And when you

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:46.000
[Guest]: read the whole piece, it gave you a very good comprehensive picture. There was no meandering,

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.720
[Guest]: you know, so he was somebody who I really enjoyed reading and obviously gave a lot more

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:55.000
[Guest]: about Australian cricket because he was an Aussie. So that's how I started. Even before

01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.600
[Guest]: I became a journalist, I was, I had a fair collection of books in my house. And I used

01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:07.280
[Guest]: to feel that Cardis is, when you're young, is your, almost everybody's ambition in the

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:12.720
[Guest]: English language. You know, Cardis, he thinks of himself as Cardis. That would be a jibe

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:16.400
[Guest]: that fellow journalists would say, you know, when you wrote a piece and they'd come next

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:20.040
[Guest]: day and dissect your report and say, apne aapko Cardis samajhta hai, you know, that

01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:26.840
[Guest]: would be a kind of tutu-mema in the press box. But Cardis was not the only one. And

01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:33.680
[Guest]: as, you know, as one keeps growing, I think there's, if I have to, and this is an advice

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:38.760
[Guest]: I still keep giving myself, but if I was a young writer starting today, I would say that

01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:43.280
[Guest]: the more you read, the better you become. So irrespective of whether you found your

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:47.200
[Guest]: voice, you also want to know what other voices are saying. And that is only possible if you

01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:51.680
[Guest]: keep reading. But if you blank yourself out saying, you know, I know my voice and I know

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:56.640
[Guest]: two other writers and that's all I'm interested in, I think you actually restrict yourself

01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:02.720
[Guest]: and then may not necessarily grow in terms of enriching your own understanding of the

01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:08.360
[Guest]: game or a situation or of a player, but also in what you send out subsequently to your

01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:15.380
[Guest]: readers or, you know, those who follow you or your newspaper. So I think constant and

01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:20.280
[Guest]: continuous reading is an absolute essential in my opinion. And you'll find that along

01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:29.200
[Guest]: the way, if you're reasonably, you know, smart, get, take feedback, are not ego-driven, somebody

01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:34.600
[Guest]: gives you sensible advice, you don't say, haha, kya bakwas, then you can, you hone your

01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:39.120
[Guest]: skills along the way. There are some things that become obsolete, you know, some expressions

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:44.120
[Guest]: that become obsolete. I read a very interesting thing on Twitter the other day, somebody raised

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:52.080
[Guest]: the issue, should we use the in sport and tagged me along. Shouldn't the word suicidal

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:58.160
[Guest]: stroke be banned, given the way mental health has become an issue? Should we be actually

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:05.400
[Guest]: saying this is part of the game? It's an interesting thought. So, I don't know, I haven't kind

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:10.560
[Guest]: of put my mind to it, but I'm saying that if you're not stimulated by what else is happening

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:15.920
[Guest]: around you, then you will not necessarily grow to full potential. I think that's what

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:20.520
[Guest]: is important for every, in any field, I would imagine that's true, you know, whether you're

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:27.680
[Guest]: writing on sport or medicine or politics or business or entertainment, the more you read,

01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:32.960
[Guest]: and especially the more you read of people who've, who set a certain benchmark, it just

01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:37.240
[Guest]: makes that, it makes the whole process that much more interesting.

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:41.520
[Amit Varma]: A number of things to react to. First of all, I love Ray Robinson as well. And in fact,

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:45.840
[Amit Varma]: for readers who want to get a sampler of all these writers, Ramchandra Guha had this lovely

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:49.920
[Amit Varma]: collection out called, I think, The Picketer Book of Cricket Writing a few years ago, which

01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:54.240
[Amit Varma]: had pieces by Fingleton, Robinson, Cardus, all of these guys. And what you said about

01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:59.120
[Amit Varma]: the way Robinson used paragraphs, reminds me of a metaphor that one of the participants

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.280
[Amit Varma]: in one of my courses used when we were chatting about the use of paragraphs. And, you know,

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:07.200
[Amit Varma]: to elaborate upon the way I was explaining them, he said that he could think of paragraphs

01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:12.640
[Amit Varma]: like bogeys in a train. So yes, yes, you have the engine driving it forward, but each bogey

01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:17.200
[Amit Varma]: plays a role and they're all connected. That's kind of what it is. And regarding what you

01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:23.560
[Amit Varma]: said about reading more, it's almost uncanny because one, that is the advice I constantly

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:28.400
[Amit Varma]: keep drumming into. In fact, if you're listening to this and you're interested in improving

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:32.760
[Amit Varma]: your writing, the one way to do it is just read, read, read. I get questions about how

01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:37.280
[Amit Varma]: do I improve my vocabulary, my grammar? How do I learn how to structure a piece? How do

01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:41.840
[Amit Varma]: I find my voice? The answer to everything is read. And I can't agree more with what

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:46.280
[Amit Varma]: you said about finding your voice because I think it's analogous in some ways to how

01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:50.040
[Amit Varma]: babies learn to speak. How do you learn to speak? You listen to all the voices around

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:54.800
[Amit Varma]: you and eventually you speak in your own way and eventually you use words in your own way.

01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:58.320
[Amit Varma]: But everything that you have, you pick up from around you and that's how you learn.

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:04.480
[Amit Varma]: So there's just no substitute for reading voraciously. And I even say that be indiscriminate

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:08.560
[Amit Varma]: about reading. I don't have patience with people who say that some books are worth reading

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:13.400
[Amit Varma]: and other books are rubbish. I think any book that grabs your attention, that keeps your

01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:19.720
[Amit Varma]: attention is doing something right and you will imbibe it by osmosis. Now I want to ask

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:22.760
[Amit Varma]: you a question picking up on something that you said in this context, but I want to take

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:27.280
[Amit Varma]: it to another context where you spoke about have the humility to take advice and feedback

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:31.640
[Amit Varma]: from others. And I say this to my writing students with the metaphor of Virat Kohli.

01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:36.160
[Amit Varma]: Where I say that listen, Virat Kohli's public image is what? That he's a brash, arrogant

01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:42.200
[Amit Varma]: young man. But nobody who achieves that level of excellence does that without having extreme

01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:46.640
[Amit Varma]: humility when they are practicing their craft. That when he is spending those thousands of

01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:50.720
[Amit Varma]: hours in the nets, he's not focusing on what he's doing right. He's focusing on what he's

01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:56.760
[Amit Varma]: doing wrong. If he's getting out a particular way, is there an issue with the footwork?

01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:00.440
[Amit Varma]: Is there an issue with the balance? You spend thousands of hours, your coach will tell you

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:04.400
[Amit Varma]: this. Other people will tell you this. Of course, in cricket, unlike in writing, you

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:08.240
[Amit Varma]: get immediate feedback on whether you're doing something right or wrong. In writing, you

01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:12.840
[Amit Varma]: can do the wrong thing for years and delude yourself into thinking it's okay. But in cricket,

01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:19.960
[Amit Varma]: you get that immediate feedback. So my question to you is this that my thesis is that to excel

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:24.840
[Amit Varma]: in anything, and you'd be able to answer this in the context of cricket, at least in that

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:28.720
[Amit Varma]: particular domain where you're excelling, you have to have extreme humility. You can

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:33.320
[Amit Varma]: be arrogant in another domain. But in that particular domain, you've got to be extremely

01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:34.320
[Guest]: humble.

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:39.720
[Guest]: Unless you shut your mind out, you know, for instance, I mean, what may happen, and I've

01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:46.240
[Guest]: seen it happen, so I won't pull my punches here. So you get access to the press box,

01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:53.240
[Guest]: a World Cup, or a Test match, and you're 24, 25, 23, whatever it is. And you say that I'm,

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.880
[Guest]: you tell yourself, I'm watching this match, it's maybe a World Cup final, and what more

01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:02.880
[Guest]: do I need to achieve, so to speak, in terms of an experience? This is it. And you shut

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:08.160
[Guest]: yourself out from other influences. And just to give you an example, you may stop reading

01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:13.320
[Guest]: because you say, why should I read, I'm watching. And whatever I've read is good enough to see

01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:18.040
[Guest]: me through because then I'm going to speak to players and get quotes and stories, my

01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:24.560
[Guest]: editor will tell me, whatever, I'll get advice, I'm speaking to colleagues. I think that's

01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:29.000
[Guest]: narrowing rather than broadening your horizon. And I would go venture further, I'd say apart

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.440
[Guest]: from cricket books, which is your stock in trade, that is something that you must read,

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:37.240
[Guest]: or books on sport. But in fact, you must read beyond sports also, you know, to enrich your

01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:42.940
[Guest]: own understanding, not just of the sport, but also of life. You know, the power of expression

01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:47.200
[Guest]: of some writers who are not writing on sport may be so influential, that it will influence

01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:52.200
[Guest]: your sports writing to get better. So I think that is something that needs to be done. And

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:58.840
[Guest]: that only comes through humility. And humility is, as you mentioned, that when Virat Kohli

01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:05.440
[Guest]: takes the field, he can't be, you know, looking down, not looking the opponent squarely in

01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:09.480
[Guest]: the eye and saying, I'm very, very humble soul. And therefore, he has to act cocky on

01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:15.720
[Guest]: the field. And that's also his personality. But he is actually very smart and very, in

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:20.600
[Guest]: many, you know, he handles his own professional life as a cricketer with a great degree of

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:26.520
[Guest]: humility. Otherwise, he's brought about a paradigm shift in the aspect of fitness. The

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:30.120
[Guest]: Indian team has never been more athletic. And that's because the captain has set the

01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:37.440
[Guest]: benchmark. I remember we were in, I was in Colombo, 2015. He had just become captain.

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:43.000
[Guest]: Dhoni had given up the captaincy. And, you know, so they lost the first test against

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.920
[Guest]: Sri Lanka, won the next one in Colombo. And there was a little luncheon arranged by, Shastri

01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:53.800
[Guest]: was the coach and he said, captain will meet. So seven, eight of us went there for lunch.

01:50:53.800 --> 01:51:02.360
[Guest]: And Virat, we were called at about 12.30 and Virat didn't turn up till about 1.15, 1.30.

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:07.000
[Guest]: So I asked Ravi, I said, what the hell is happening? Where is he? So he said, no, he's

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.880
[Guest]: in the gym. So I said, OK, but where are the others? He said, if he's in the gym, how can

01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:20.720
[Guest]: the others be out? So he had set that example because, and very early in his captaincy,

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:24.880
[Guest]: you know, role as a captain, that we need to all get fit. It's not that he held them

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:29.400
[Guest]: back physically, but if you set an example and the others follow, then, you know, it

01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:34.400
[Guest]: just makes a difference to the team. So it doesn't mean that, see, look, when you look

01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:41.760
[Guest]: at sport or in cricket, there are more failures than successes, even for the greatest of players.

01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:47.040
[Guest]: If Tendulkar has played, you know, 200 matches or whatever it is, and so many more innings,

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:53.000
[Guest]: it's not that he scored a 100 every time. He's made 51 test 100s. But the number of

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:59.560
[Guest]: times he's not made 100 or even a 50 is far greater than the number of times he's made

01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:05.880
[Guest]: 50-plus scores, you know. So it's a question of consistency over a period of time which

01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:12.760
[Guest]: sets you apart from the, you know, average Joe as a cricketer who's there, the special

01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:19.600
[Guest]: players. It's what you do, how you, how often you do it, that marks you out as special.

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:24.640
[Guest]: And that, to reach that status, you also, you have to be consistently improving and

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:32.580
[Guest]: learning. This is a, and sport can be very cruel, very punishing because you are aging.

01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:38.400
[Guest]: So there is this age at which you start, at which you peak, and then there's a plateau

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:45.120
[Guest]: and then it is downhill. And how do you arrest that downhill from being, you know, rapid?

01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:51.120
[Guest]: Your reflexes go. You may be jaded. You may be mentally fatigued. That's when you dig

01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:55.280
[Guest]: into your reserves and come up. And there are lessons that you learned early in life

01:52:55.280 --> 01:53:00.560
[Guest]: that you bring into play. And there's a lot that happens even with, I take that as an

01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:06.400
[Guest]: example even for writing. I'm still writing articles and columns. I'm doing other stuff.

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:11.320
[Guest]: I'm not, you know, I feel that there's still some more to learn. But I also go back to

01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:15.800
[Guest]: my earliest learn. What are the drills you learn to get an interesting insight into a

01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:20.480
[Guest]: player or a story and how do you do it? So I keep asking myself, is there a way I can

01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:25.760
[Guest]: do it better? And I think that's important, because otherwise, it's like being there,

01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:30.800
[Guest]: done that, you know, and then it can lead to actually being bored. You can just hang

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:33.280
[Amit Varma]: on to a job rather than enjoy it.

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:37.600
[Amit Varma]: What you said about that arc of a sports person's life, that, you know, you're very good, you're

01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:41.400
[Amit Varma]: very talented, you work hard, but at some point, you peak and then it's all downhill.

01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:46.040
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that, you know, unlike our careers, necessarily, where we can hopefully

01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:50.900
[Amit Varma]: keep getting better, a sports person's career always ends in tragedy, where they are not

01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:57.840
[Amit Varma]: what they used to be. And that can, at one level become difficult to deal with. And how

01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:03.260
[Amit Varma]: you respond to that can really vary on a lot of factors. So in your time dealing with,

01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:06.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, so many cricketers who are personal friends, so many cricketers who have kind

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:10.760
[Amit Varma]: of gone through these ups and downs, some of these rounds may have been sudden, some

01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:15.520
[Amit Varma]: of them may have been gradual, but they always then have to mentally recalibrate who they

01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:19.680
[Amit Varma]: are and what they can do in their place in the world and the place of cricket in their

01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:20.680
[Guest]: lives.

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:25.760
[Guest]: So Amit, I think retirement or when you're approaching the end, it can be quite a terrifying

01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:31.400
[Guest]: period for the, you know, the performing artists, in a sense. Imagine if you're a trapeze artist

01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:36.920
[Guest]: and, you know, your shelf life is, for a trapeze artist, maybe seven, eight, nine years. You

01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:40.440
[Guest]: know, in a cricketer's career, it may be, you can stretch it to 20 years, but still

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:44.560
[Guest]: there has to be an end. And you're actually in the peak of your prime, you're in the prime

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:50.720
[Guest]: of your life, if you're 38, 37, 40, you know, at best, say. And then what do you do? The

01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:57.960
[Guest]: thought of not doing what you've done for 20 years can create a lot of, you know, turmoil

01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:03.760
[Guest]: within the person. And therefore, a lot of people delay their retirement till they are

01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:09.600
[Guest]: dumped or they start flopping. And then there's a lot of remorse and regret associated with

01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:13.860
[Guest]: it, which is either publicly expressed or not, but they go through, you know, I mean,

01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:18.920
[Guest]: some of them can go through very torrid times personally in their own lives. There's also

01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:23.280
[Guest]: this whole, it's a cliche, but it's there, you know, quit when you're at the top. But

01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:27.160
[Guest]: it's easier said than done. When you're at the top, why do you quit? Why should you,

01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:32.160
[Guest]: you know? And especially in the old days, where there wasn't much financial reward or

01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:37.120
[Guest]: financial security, the financial security is there now. The insecurity is about what

01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:41.600
[Guest]: do I do with myself after I've quit? And a lot of it is the conditioning. You're used

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:46.720
[Guest]: to fame, you're used to popularity, you're used to adulation, all that going. It's not

01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:50.680
[Guest]: very different from film stars in that sense, at least for cricketers in the Indian or the

01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:56.240
[Guest]: subcontinent, you know, the kind of larger-than-life persona they occupy. So that is something

01:55:56.240 --> 01:56:05.480
[Guest]: that also, I think, is deserving of attention when, you know, mentoring has become so big

01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:11.060
[Guest]: now. How to handle money, how to handle fame and how to handle retirement as it approaches

01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:16.860
[Guest]: is something that needs to be aggressively taught, I think, especially when in a country

01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:20.640
[Guest]: like India, where there's so much competition. You know, I know, we all know players now

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:26.920
[Guest]: who are, especially in the IPL. The IPL has got many pluses to it, as we know. There are

01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:32.040
[Guest]: some downsides that it brings you into the limelight suddenly. You have two bad seasons

01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:38.480
[Guest]: and you're out of sight, you know? You may lose your place in the India team. What hurts

01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:42.760
[Guest]: even more is you lost your place in the IPL team. You've been dumped by a franchise. Your

01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:46.520
[Guest]: money earnings is also gone, your place in the national team is gone, and you're left

01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:51.720
[Guest]: with nothing to clutch on to, you know, hang on to. So these are areas that I think that

01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:59.240
[Guest]: it's not all as rosy as it appears from the outside. One has to be cognizant of what they

01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:07.940
[Guest]: go through. For writers, it's certainly not the case. You know, we've got a lifetime that

01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:15.240
[Guest]: one can practice your craft or your vocation. There's no retirement age now. You can lose

01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:20.520
[Guest]: a job, but you don't need to stop writing or being a commentator or doing a podcast

01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:25.440
[Guest]: or whatever. So in that sense, it's a far more extended lifestyle. The only thing which

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:31.880
[Guest]: people like us need to guard against is, you know, sense of deja vu, one more match, you

01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:32.880
[Amit Varma]: know?

01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:37.320
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, I'm reminded by what you said of this anecdote. I think it's about Bradman

01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:43.040
[Amit Varma]: and I forget the exact, the gist of it is this, that in the 1970s, Bradman is asked

01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:47.200
[Amit Varma]: that if you played these Western Indian quicks, what would your average against them would

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:52.920
[Amit Varma]: be? And he said, it would be about 60 or 70. And they said, oh, okay, that low. And Bradman

01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:55.040
[Guest]: said, what do you expect? I'm 80 years old.

01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.040
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:57.040
[Guest]: Whatever that is.

01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:04.940
[Guest]: But, you know, just reminding you just about Bradman. So, you know, this sense of invincibility

01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:11.280
[Guest]: in sport is such a myth. You know, the greatest are not invincible. Bradman made zero in his

01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:15.840
[Guest]: last test innings. Had he made four, he would have finished with 100 of, average of 100.

01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:21.680
[Guest]: So, even the great Bradman, now there's all kinds of stories that he was, he got so emotional

01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:25.800
[Guest]: that there were tears that welled up in his eye and therefore, he lost sight of Eric Holley's

01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:29.680
[Guest]: leg break or googly or whatever it was and got bold.

01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:35.160
[Guest]: It's also to me, a sign of mortality, you know, that every sports person, whoever it

01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:40.440
[Guest]: may be, whether it's a Tiger Woods or a Garfield Sobers or a Don Bradman or Pelly or, you know,

01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:44.360
[Guest]: Pelly can miss the easiest of goals. It can happen.

01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:48.360
[Amit Varma]: And I vaguely remember in Bradman's case when Holley's bowled him for zero, one of his ex-teammates

01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:51.920
[Amit Varma]: in the commentary box, I think probably Fingleton, two of his teammates were in the commentary

01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:55.280
[Amit Varma]: box and they turned to each other and they laughed in delight. And that also leads to

01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:00.240
[Amit Varma]: the question that if that happens, what have you achieved really? You know, which is another

01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:05.200
[Amit Varma]: kind of question. No, but the film star metaphor breaks down here because SRK can still play

01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:08.400
[Amit Varma]: a teenager in his 50s, but cricketers can have done.

01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:12.760
[Guest]: Also more difficult for a sports person compared, I mean, I did mention about performing artists,

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:20.720
[Guest]: but if it's Amitabh Bachchan or Shah Rukh Khan, Salman or whoever, but you can have

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:24.080
[Guest]: multiple retakes. You can have 50 retakes till you get it right. You can go and watch

01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:27.600
[Guest]: the video monitor and say, look, I can do it differently. I can do it better and probably

01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:31.600
[Guest]: do it better. But for a sports person, you miss a penalty, you're gone.

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:35.840
[Guest]: Unless you're WG Gray, sir. It's that famous story about how an umpire gave him out and

01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:38.800
[Guest]: he stayed there and the umpire said, have they come to see you raise your finger or

01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:43.880
[Amit Varma]: have they come to see me bat? So here's another question that, you know, like you pointed

01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:49.520
[Amit Varma]: out, if someone was to say to either you or me that, hey guys, like the cliche goes, quit

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:54.040
[Amit Varma]: when they ask why instead of why not, or, you know, quit when you're at the top, as

01:59:54.040 --> 02:00:00.720
[Amit Varma]: you just said, we would just laugh. Buzz off. Yeah. Buzz off, my top is yet to come. Two,

02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:04.000
[Amit Varma]: even if I feel my powers are declining, as long as I'm enjoying writing, I'm going to

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:10.240
[Amit Varma]: keep writing. I think that there is this pressure that is sometimes put on sports people where

02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:14.560
[Amit Varma]: we focus on their legacies more than they themselves do. Like the word legacy itself.

02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:19.400
[Amit Varma]: I don't even know what it means or why anyone should give a damn about it. I imagine somebody

02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:23.680
[Amit Varma]: starts playing a sport. It's because they love it. Of course, you know, and they should

02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:28.840
[Amit Varma]: play till they love it. And even if they are on a decline, like maybe Roger Federer today,

02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:32.000
[Amit Varma]: and he says, no, I love it. I want to play. I don't care if I'm not winning two grand

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.520
[Amit Varma]: slams a year, I want to play. We should respect that, you know.

02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:39.600
[Guest]: But that's easier than easier in individual sport than in a team sport, you know, because

02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:44.520
[Guest]: team sport you're selected. Roger Federer can decide he wants to play and maybe lose

02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:49.160
[Guest]: in the first round and keep playing. That's fine. But in a team sport, somebody else is

02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:53.360
[Guest]: selecting you and the impact you have or the influence you have on the team, or not, you

02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:57.920
[Guest]: may have a debilitating influence on the team. So then you're chucked out. So I think that,

02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:03.080
[Guest]: you know, different sports will have different yardsticks. But you're right. You can't decide

02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:07.240
[Guest]: on your legacy at the start of your career, because you'll get so consumed by that, you

02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:11.520
[Guest]: know, and weighed down that you might have nothing to show for it. Forget about legacy,

02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:18.080
[Guest]: you know. I mean, there are players who came meteoric rise and then gone. So there's no

02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:22.280
[Guest]: legacy that has been left behind barring the first couple of years. Legacy comes with the

02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:29.400
[Guest]: body of work that is voluminous. And its impact is not just about averages alone. In the case

02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:34.280
[Guest]: of cricket, it can. Averages can mean a heck of a lot. But also in the impact. I mean,

02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:39.480
[Guest]: Virendra Sehwag's, in my opinion, Virendra Sehwag's legacy is fabulous. His average may

02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:43.880
[Guest]: not be in the 50s. He's 49-something, just about touching 50. But with a few more knockouts,

02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:50.120
[Guest]: he'd have been 50-plus. But the impact he had on international cricket, apart from Indian

02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:55.280
[Guest]: cricket, the way he would win matches, the fear he would create in opposing bowlers is

02:01:55.280 --> 02:02:04.440
[Guest]: something that, you know, it's a fabulous legacy. And it was such a conundrum to see

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:08.720
[Guest]: a Virendra Sehwag kind of an opener in Indian cricket. You know, normally you would associate

02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:14.360
[Guest]: these buccaneering types with an Aussie or maybe a West Indian, not even an Englishman.

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:20.680
[Guest]: Maybe a madcap Pakistani batsman. I mean, I sometimes think the best opening pair in

02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:25.560
[Guest]: the history of Indian cricket would be Gavaskar and Sehwag. But a complete contrast in approach.

02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:31.680
[Guest]: Both great in their own ways. But look at… And also, you can't deny that Sehwag has left

02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:36.520
[Guest]: behind a magnificent legacy. Now, it may never be achievable by somebody else unless you've

02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:44.600
[Guest]: got a similar mindset and a hard disk which works like Sehwag's did. You know, how he

02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:46.680
[Amit Varma]: played boggles the mind even now.

02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:52.840
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely outstanding. Let's continue talking about your career at this point. You've become

02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:57.080
[Amit Varma]: a cricket journalist. Do you see yourself being at this point someone who will write

02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:02.360
[Amit Varma]: about cricket all his life? Because what it seems to me from that vantage point of, say,

02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:07.240
[Amit Varma]: the early 80s, you know, before 83 happens, from that vantage point, when you're looking

02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:10.240
[Amit Varma]: ahead, you don't know what's happened. So it must seem like more of the same, more of

02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:15.320
[Amit Varma]: the same all your life. And eventually, of course, what happened we know is that 83 happened

02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:20.280
[Amit Varma]: and then liberalisation happened and then the game exploded and IPL happened. And essentially,

02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:24.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, you've basically covered cricket through the most exciting decades. And, you

02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:30.880
[Amit Varma]: know, we are both so fortunate to have been doing what we kind of did. But at that time,

02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:34.480
[Amit Varma]: what was your conception? Were you thinking that I've started in journalism with cricket

02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:39.920
[Amit Varma]: writing, I also want to do other things? Were there other kinds of journalism which inspired

02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:42.080
[Guest]: you? You know, tell me a bit.

02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:47.240
[Guest]: So look, to be honest, I thought I wouldn't last in journalism. I thought I would actually

02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:52.360
[Guest]: kind of get back maybe to law. A, the money wasn't good. I was married. I had become a

02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:58.240
[Guest]: father. I was a young father by, you know, by end 82, 83. I went to the World Cup in

02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:05.680
[Guest]: 1983. And I, you know, I said this is my last, last assignment. Maybe I'll do something else.

02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:10.040
[Guest]: Maybe I'll join up as a junior lawyer somewhere. My father's, you know, goodwill was there.

02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:16.240
[Guest]: I could have got into a law firm and work my way up. By that time, he was, you know,

02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:22.600
[Guest]: he had passed away in 1973. So I couldn't join him, but people he knew. I went to the

02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:29.160
[Guest]: World Cup, I thought, to cover a big event. That was a kind of an ambition, a dream. So

02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:35.520
[Guest]: I said, let's do this and see. But I went there and, you know, India won the World Cup.

02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:42.000
[Guest]: And it just kind of changed my mind completely. I said, the excitement and the thrill of seeing

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.400
[Guest]: India win that World Cup, when I came back, I said, forget about law. This is what I'm

02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:56.360
[Guest]: going to stick with. And I stuck with it for 10 years nonstop. And I was on the road, virtually,

02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:00.920
[Guest]: you know, every time India went on any tour, I was there. Or tour even domestically, I

02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:05.520
[Guest]: was there. And to the extent that I, when I look back, I think sometimes that I didn't

02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:12.760
[Guest]: see my son grow up. You know, you're always on the road. And then in 93, I got an offer,

02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:18.920
[Guest]: which was very strange. It was kind of sprung on me by the owners of Midday, Tariq Ansari.

02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:26.000
[Guest]: He said, I want you to edit the paper. So I said, you know, I remember this very distinctly

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:29.880
[Guest]: because the office was in Tardeo. We walked down towards Bhatia Hospital, there was a

02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:37.160
[Guest]: Kamath's restaurant across the road, and over Medu Vada and Chutney, he said, will you take

02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:42.120
[Guest]: this, you know, why don't you become the editor? I said, I'm doing sports, I'm quite happy.

02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:48.560
[Guest]: He said, no, but, you know, think about it. So I said, okay, give me six months. I had

02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:52.920
[Guest]: planned, it was within the organization, it had been worked out that I will go to Wimbledon

02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:59.320
[Guest]: in 93. And there was a tour to Sri Lanka coming up. So I wanted to do those two tours. He

02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:05.440
[Guest]: said, fine, let's wait. So in the meanwhile, he also sent, you know, I went to New York

02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:10.600
[Guest]: and did a stint in New York Post, which was also a tabloid for about two or three weeks.

02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:14.320
[Guest]: I was there just to see how newsroom functions and all are happening, which actually quite

02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:20.440
[Guest]: excited me. So when I came back, I did the Wimbledon, I did the Sri Lanka tour, and then

02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:26.880
[Guest]: I became the editor of Midday. And it was a big shift for me. It took me that much time

02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:33.320
[Guest]: to, you know, I had a great life. I was on much envied life, if you can, you know, even

02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:38.360
[Guest]: within the newsroom. I mean, whoever may have been the editor, the cricket correspondents

02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:44.440
[Guest]: or cricket writers, life was the toast of the newsroom. And I had to give that up. And

02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:48.800
[Guest]: then when you're editor, then there are, you know, you become accountable for everybody

02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:53.040
[Guest]: else. Here you are accountable to your department. By that time, I was also the sports editor

02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:58.240
[Guest]: and the editor of Sportsweek magazine. So to give all that up and take on this assignment

02:06:58.240 --> 02:07:06.520
[Guest]: in 93, Sportsweek had shut down. But it was a challenge, which I think finally, it captured

02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:13.160
[Guest]: my imagination. And then I said, let's do it. That's where I switched and took up, I

02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:19.160
[Guest]: became editor of Midday. But once a year, I would take a tour on my leave would be even

02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:23.360
[Guest]: if it was a short tour, it meant just going and doing two matches, I would keep up with

02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:24.360
[Guest]: cricket.

02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:28.760
[Amit Varma]: One, what did you learn at New York Post? You know, what did they do differently that

02:07:28.760 --> 02:07:34.040
[Amit Varma]: impressed you? And that you said that you want to incorporate it as editor? And also,

02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:38.440
[Amit Varma]: what specifically about the job of an editor, because a lot of people who will start off

02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:41.880
[Amit Varma]: with the kind of work that you enjoy doing, you're traveling everywhere, you're covering

02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:45.720
[Amit Varma]: cricket, it's a dream life, will also say they don't want to manage people. And it's

02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:50.880
[Amit Varma]: a completely different skill set. Obviously, as a sports editor, and all you had some experience

02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:55.760
[Amit Varma]: at that. But one, it's a different skill set managing people. And two, it's a different

02:07:55.760 --> 02:08:01.240
[Amit Varma]: skill set editing an actual general newspaper where you have to assign priorities, decide

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:06.000
[Amit Varma]: what gets covered all of that. So did you just dive into it without thinking about it

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:11.040
[Amit Varma]: much? Or did you spend some time thinking about it and craft a kind of editorial philosophy

02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:15.240
[Amit Varma]: for yourself that these are the kind of things I will focus on? What was that like?

02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:19.800
[Guest]: So you know, there are two questions. And one is that what did I learn in New York Post?

02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:23.520
[Guest]: I thought in New York Post, though it's a very short stint, and it was just to help

02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:28.440
[Guest]: me come to terms with tabloid journalism. That was the purpose of my going there was

02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:32.800
[Guest]: in terms of layout, screaming headlines, which capture your attention. You know, most of

02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:36.440
[Guest]: the papers, at least in the afternoon, the midday was an afternoon paper is sold on the

02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:41.080
[Guest]: stands. It's not necessarily home delivered, it used to be office delivered, but the stand

02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:46.000
[Guest]: sales were the most. So it had to be very appealing for a passerby to say, hey, I want

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:52.200
[Guest]: this copy. And then the the mix of stories, you know, how much crime becomes a big thing

02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:56.720
[Guest]: for tabloids. So how do you play up the crime stories? And therefore, what should be the

02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:01.840
[Guest]: drill of the reporters and the access into getting information about crime, those stories,

02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:06.960
[Guest]: those are things that, you know, I went on beat reporting with the reporters just to

02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:11.840
[Guest]: find out how they go about doing it, you know, and I found that they were very aggressive

02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:17.840
[Guest]: in New York, though it's a big city, much like Mumbai or bigger than Mumbai in terms

02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:22.360
[Guest]: of news coverage. But it was very exciting just being out there with the beat reporter

02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:27.360
[Guest]: and the kind they, the way they approached and, you know, went after news. There was

02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:32.520
[Guest]: an aggression, which I didn't find existed in Indian newsrooms.

02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:33.880
[Guest]: Give me an example.

02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:41.880
[Guest]: So if there's a drug bust, you know, in New York City, then they would send two reporters,

02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:48.520
[Guest]: one to the place of the crime, one to the, you know, and so swiftly into where the police

02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:52.800
[Guest]: station, wherever the case is going to be investigated. And they were far more advanced

02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:59.080
[Guest]: in their, you know, how information was transmitted. I mean, telephone access in India, even in

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:05.520
[Guest]: 93, was not so easy. While for the US, for the Americans, it was far easier. But they

02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:09.000
[Guest]: would have on one crime story, maybe three, four guys, they would pull out somebody from

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:14.240
[Guest]: here and send them for the, this is a big story. Let's put all our arsenal in this and

02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:18.560
[Guest]: play it up because this is going to be a big story, a front page story. While in India,

02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:22.480
[Guest]: I think we were still a little structured. These are your crime reporters. These are

02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:27.880
[Guest]: your civic reporters. Yes, they were all of that. But if a story broke, then, you know,

02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:31.840
[Guest]: you put all your might towards that because ultimately tabloids sold on your front page

02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:37.080
[Guest]: story and maybe page three and then the features and then the sports.

02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:44.520
[Guest]: I think the single biggest impression on me was a very aggressive pursuit of two or three

02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:52.200
[Guest]: stories rather than getting 30 stories. Because even for Midday, very popular for its crossword

02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:58.000
[Guest]: and its comics and entertainment section and glamour columns and all that. If you chase

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:04.200
[Guest]: 30 stories, you might end up with not even three or three of any great, you know, worth.

02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:07.920
[Guest]: So that was one of the things which I learned. And when I came back, I tried to implement

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:14.040
[Guest]: that in. And I think also my predecessors had left a very good newsroom. You know, there's

02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:20.360
[Guest]: a lot of young talent, you know, Nikhil Lakshman, Prem Panikkar, who preceded me, Meenal Bagel.

02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:24.520
[Guest]: These all, they all became household names. They were, Nikhil was a very well-known. Sharda

02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:32.000
[Guest]: Ogra. Sharda Ogra, Prajwal Hegde. Hemal. We had Hemal. In Midday, actually, we had an

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:38.640
[Guest]: all-women's sports team. You know, legendary. And including the photographer, Savita Kirloskar.

02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:41.000
[Guest]: Yeah, who worked with me later at Wisden. Yeah, wonderful photographer.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:45.320
[Guest]: Right. And she was the one who I, you know, when I became the editor, I sent to Yorkshire

02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:51.400
[Guest]: when Sachin went there to cover his stay there because she was a writer as well as a photographer.

02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:55.640
[Guest]: The energy, I think what I enjoyed most in Midday, and that was an advantage, that they

02:11:55.640 --> 02:12:00.640
[Guest]: were all, it was a very young team, barring some, you know, some of the news editor, some

02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:08.800
[Guest]: of those who were got from other newspapers and brought there. But by and large, the army

02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:13.120
[Guest]: of people who were there at the desk and the reporters, they were all very young, all looking

02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:18.160
[Guest]: to get ahead, enjoying their work, getting stories. Obviously, a lot of them would move

02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:25.800
[Guest]: on, you know, like Sharda, you know. But they were really good at their job. So, in that

02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:29.720
[Guest]: sense, it became a little easier for me. I didn't have to strain too much. One had to

02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:35.560
[Guest]: be a little disciplined because I was so used to being on my own jaunts and to get restricted

02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:40.760
[Guest]: to a cabin and pacing the newsroom was a bit of a challenge in the first maybe four, five,

02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:46.280
[Guest]: six months. But I started enjoying it. There's a dimension to running a newspaper, which,

02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:52.880
[Guest]: you know, when you're in that kind of position of an editor, your locus standeye changes

02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:58.560
[Guest]: and everything kind of comes to you and then flows from you in many ways. It can't be so

02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:02.680
[Guest]: centralized. There are department heads and you have to work well with them, which is

02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:07.480
[Guest]: what I always believe in. I think, you know, delegation of responsibility is very important,

02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:12.760
[Guest]: provided you know what you're doing for the next day's edition or the next weeks or how

02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:16.400
[Guest]: you're planning and budgeting. So, all that comes into play. And I think it just widened

02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:20.840
[Guest]: my horizon, my perspective, not just about journalism, but about life, because you come

02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:24.900
[Guest]: to know and come across so many different kinds of people.

02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:30.320
[Amit Varma]: In terms of writing, how different was it? Like, for example, one of the things that

02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:35.160
[Amit Varma]: I do in one of the webinars I teach is I'll take examples from tabloids, from mainstream

02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:39.760
[Amit Varma]: newspapers, from a magazine like the New Yorker, or I'll take a Guardian long read and from

02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:44.800
[Amit Varma]: a literary novel. And I'll take examples from each of these to point out how the imperatives

02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:48.760
[Amit Varma]: are different and therefore the writing is different. The tabloid example I think I use

02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:53.920
[Amit Varma]: is from Daily Mail in England, where, you know, they pack in a lot of info in the headline.

02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:59.080
[Amit Varma]: And the core assumption for that is that the reader can stop reading at any point in time.

02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:02.760
[Amit Varma]: Extreme short attention span, like I would typically read midday when I'm in a local

02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:07.240
[Amit Varma]: train commuting somewhere in the mid 90s and one hand is holding the bar above my head

02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:12.000
[Amit Varma]: and the other hand as a midday. And therefore you have a very fast rhythm, short one sentence

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.360
[Amit Varma]: parahs, everything is information, you don't have the space to go deep or give context

02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:21.520
[Amit Varma]: or whatever. And I'm of course giving sort of an extreme example. And therefore the imperatives

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:25.280
[Amit Varma]: of writing for a tabloid are very different, even from the imperatives of writing for a

02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:30.400
[Amit Varma]: broadsheet newspaper, like you cannot be Neville Cardas in an afternoon paper, for example.

02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:33.280
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit more about this.

02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:38.600
[Guest]: So you have to, yeah, so you have to customise, you know, you have to customise your writing

02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:45.920
[Guest]: skills for suiting a tabloid. And I think what plays a huge role in tabloid journalism,

02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:50.600
[Guest]: this is again a commuter paper, midday, you know, most tabloids end up being even in big

02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:54.480
[Guest]: cities like London or New York. These are all commuter papers because they're easy to

02:14:54.480 --> 02:15:02.640
[Guest]: read even on a train or in a bus. So sharp headlines which provoke, which excite, which

02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:08.120
[Guest]: intrigue, you know, you can have lead-ins and, you know, maybe an intro to it which

02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:13.760
[Guest]: is two lines, which more or less tells you a story or it keeps or it tickles your palate

02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:17.560
[Guest]: so much that you say, I will read it a little later, if not right now, but you will read

02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:23.720
[Guest]: it. And then there is a whole other, what I call, condiments that come in, which are,

02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:30.400
[Guest]: you know, midday tab, the crossword that we had was almost like a no-brainer crossword.

02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:35.640
[Guest]: But the idea was, was a deliberate attempt, that you make it so easy that everybody enjoys

02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:41.040
[Guest]: it. It's not the London Times or the Times of India cryptic crossword, which two out

02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:44.960
[Guest]: of hundred may manage and everybody is frustrated and say, I will not attempt it. That's a different

02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:49.720
[Guest]: profile of leadership. And if you have a large mass of readers, then you can attempt all

02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:56.200
[Guest]: of that. There are comics for relief. There's, it's a, in a way, it's snacky. But I must

02:15:56.200 --> 02:16:02.680
[Guest]: say in the context of midday, it became a very powerful influence in city life.

02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:03.680
[Guest]: It did.

02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:09.680
[Guest]: You know, so it was number two to TUI and we would slap ourselves on the back or thump

02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:15.280
[Guest]: ourselves on the back and say, wow, we are competing with TUI. Numbers were, of course,

02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:20.720
[Guest]: of huge disparity. But in terms of influence, in terms of people talking about midday, we

02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:25.720
[Guest]: had the diary page. The standards set by Bheram Contractor, who was there earlier before he

02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:30.080
[Guest]: started Afternoon Dispatch and Courier, was delectable, very high standard of writing

02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:34.760
[Guest]: the diary because he had his own way of doing it. So to keep that going, we had to get very

02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:39.920
[Guest]: skilful writers. I think Prem Panekar did it for a long while when Nikhil was the editor.

02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:45.920
[Guest]: And then we had, you know, several other people who came. So the diary became an important

02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:52.880
[Guest]: aspect and facet of this paper, which gave you snippets into life in the city, which

02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:57.520
[Guest]: otherwise don't come in news reports, you know, a little bit of spice about society.

02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:03.360
[Guest]: The whole packaging of it, how do you capture, how do you make midday a microcosm of Mumbai's

02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:08.080
[Guest]: life was really the attempt. And that I found very, very, you know, exciting.

02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:12.560
[Amit Varma]: With my rose-tinted glasses on, I would say that that almost felt for me like a golden

02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:17.600
[Amit Varma]: age of midday, in the sense that I think what a tabloid should do best is take that sideways

02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:22.080
[Amit Varma]: look. Your mainstream newspaper is covering all the main shit that happens. In the tabloid

02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:27.400
[Amit Varma]: that, yeah, okay, you got to, you know, attract eyeballs, you do the sensational headlines

02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:31.920
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. But you also take those little sideways glimpses that a mainstream paper

02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:35.440
[Amit Varma]: can't, and you guys did that very well. What do you feel now when you look at, you know,

02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:38.240
[Amit Varma]: midday and other similar papers, not to single out one?

02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:44.640
[Guest]: Yeah, I think most papers have, I mean, it sounds harsh to say it, but the word which

02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:49.100
[Guest]: comes to mind is tepid. So even while midday was a, what we used to call the complete family

02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:55.120
[Guest]: newspaper and a city, you know, city-based, comprehensive package, fun, entertainment,

02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:59.440
[Guest]: excitement, but there was also sometimes, not sometimes, but the attempt was to find

02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:03.260
[Guest]: edge to our reporting also. So there will be a lot of investigative stuff. The kidney

02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:10.360
[Guest]: sales racket, you know, which was broken by midday. We had, I think amongst, we were the

02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:15.800
[Guest]: first paper, if I remember correctly, following up on the bomb blast case, Bombay bomb blast

02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:20.640
[Guest]: case and the trial, the Tata court proceedings which are going on, which some of the mainstream

02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:25.520
[Guest]: or the mainstream newspapers were a little hesitant to, and then of course, competition

02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:29.640
[Guest]: arrives, then everybody starts covering and then it gets amplified, which is what was

02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:38.440
[Guest]: needed. So midday was in fairly, very ballsy for its time, you know. So a little cheeky,

02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:45.600
[Guest]: it was provocative, it was, you know, and everybody wanted to be featured in midday.

02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:49.800
[Guest]: From Mumbai's movers and shakers, everybody wanted to be seen in midday or featured in

02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:53.760
[Guest]: midday in some way. The weekend paper would be Sunday midday where we would actually have

02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:59.320
[Guest]: a lot of long reads and columns and, you know, stuff that you can read at leisure, and that

02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:04.560
[Guest]: would be delivered in the morning. So I was there as editor for seven and a half years.

02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:10.920
[Guest]: And in many ways, those were the best years of my journalism along with whatever I've

02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:12.240
[Guest]: done in sport and cricket.

02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:17.600
[Amit Varma]: Take me to the next step of your journey. What happens next? Where do you go after that?

02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:27.320
[Guest]: So 2000 is when I, 2001 is, you know, 2000 is when I quit. And I actually, I'd come to

02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:34.880
[Guest]: know Mark Mascarinis by then, you know, WorldTel was his company and he was managing Sachin.

02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:41.480
[Guest]: And he had this great desire to start, to make India actually, he saw it, he was a visionary

02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:46.960
[Guest]: in many ways, he was a big talking Yankee, but he was also a visionary. And he saw India

02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:52.480
[Guest]: as becoming the hub of international cricket in a really big way at that point in time.

02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:59.640
[Guest]: So he wanted to start in, you know, 2000 was the time when everybody was talking dot-com.

02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:06.400
[Guest]: So he wanted a dot cricket website, dot-com and a cricket magazine. He got in touch with

02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:10.680
[Guest]: me, we talked about it for almost six, eight, nine months before I said yes to him because

02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:17.680
[Guest]: leaving midday was not easy. But I just felt that maybe I need a slightly different challenge

02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:24.600
[Guest]: and, you know, new medium to explore, which is the dot-com. So I quit in March of 2000

02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:33.360
[Guest]: or thereabouts. And we started this TotalCricket.com and Cricket Talk. And just as we started,

02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:41.840
[Guest]: the match fixing scam broke. And Mark had his venture capitalist and whoever else who

02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:48.200
[Guest]: pulled back from supporting the website, the magazine continued for six, eight months.

02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:54.880
[Guest]: By the end of the year, it looked to me that, you know, it's not making headway. And I was

02:20:54.880 --> 02:21:01.320
[Guest]: being pursued at that point in time by Times of India, you know, you join us and join us.

02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:07.560
[Guest]: So they made it, you know, wear two hats. You become the editor of Bombay Times, which

02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:11.720
[Guest]: is not the Bombay Times as it is seen now, as it is now, because at that point in time,

02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:18.640
[Guest]: they wanted it to be an extended or more expanded version of Midday, you know, a city glamour

02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:24.440
[Guest]: and all that, but more city and stuff, and also be national sports editor. And that attracted

02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:29.320
[Guest]: me. I said, you know, wearing two hats is great. So, you know, so I said yes, and I

02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:35.720
[Guest]: joined TOI in November 2000. And I was there for about four, five years. And then I left

02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:41.760
[Guest]: because by that time, Bombay Times had become a complete entertainment supplement rather

02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:50.560
[Guest]: than a city supplement. And I was, you know, then I was doing only sports. And then DNA

02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:56.600
[Guest]: was being plotted. And they approached me, DNA, okay, would you like to join? And you

02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:02.880
[Guest]: know, you'll be heading, they had planned a collegium system of editors, which was quite

02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:07.000
[Guest]: interesting at that point in time. And they wanted me to do the whole city thing plus

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:12.320
[Guest]: sports. And also then they added the Sunday Pit to start with. And I found that was exciting

02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:21.320
[Guest]: enough. So I moved to DNA, which lasted another good five years. But, you know, I don't think

02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:28.560
[Guest]: the paper went exactly the way it was planned, or where it was headed. And yeah, 2009 end,

02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:36.640
[Guest]: I opted out and I had the choice to work with another newspaper again or another or strike

02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:43.160
[Guest]: out on my own. And I said, if not now, then never. You know, I was 54. I said, let me

02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:48.040
[Guest]: just try and see what what happens from here. Let's see what happens. And yeah, it's been

02:22:48.040 --> 02:22:55.640
[Guest]: about 12 years since I've been writing, doing stuff. I've done commentary for Star Sports,

02:22:55.640 --> 02:23:00.320
[Guest]: for Sony. I've done a lot of television. I'm doing a lot. I've done a lot of work on the

02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:04.200
[Guest]: digital space. And I continue doing a lot of work in text.

02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:08.400
[Amit Varma]: Awesome. What a journey. And you know, for my listeners who are into cricket and into

02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:12.640
[Amit Varma]: cricket journalism, but may not have heard of cricket talk a quick little bit of context

02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:16.560
[Amit Varma]: cricket talk, you know, you edited it, like you said, it came out for a few months. But

02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:20.200
[Amit Varma]: one of the impressive things you did there, as we were discussing over lunch a little

02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:25.240
[Amit Varma]: while back, is you put together an outstanding team. So you had young writers like Akshay

02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:30.600
[Amit Varma]: Sawai, Rahul Bhattacharya, and you got Sambit Bal to do the website for it. Sambit had just

02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:34.720
[Amit Varma]: left Gentleman, which was like India's version of Esquire and a bloody good magazine while

02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:40.720
[Amit Varma]: Sambit was editing it. But he moved on from there, joined you to sort of run the website.

02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:45.840
[Amit Varma]: And then you parted ways, you went to Times, and he went on to take wisdom.com, where one

02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:49.760
[Amit Varma]: of the remarkable things I think he did as an editor, which was important for cricket

02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:55.080
[Amit Varma]: journalism in India, was just got a lot of young writers and bright, he was a magnet

02:23:55.080 --> 02:24:00.480
[Amit Varma]: for good young writers. You know, people like Rahul Bhattacharya, Dilip Premchandran, S.

02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:05.360
[Amit Varma]: Rajesh joined around the same time as me, and a whole bunch of others, Siddhartha Vaidyanathan,

02:24:05.360 --> 02:24:10.960
[Amit Varma]: Sid V came later. And I think that just kind of had an early butterfly effect in the sense

02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:16.920
[Amit Varma]: of what, you know, using the new medium, figuring out what was possible. And many of these writers

02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:21.800
[Amit Varma]: went on to, you know, though I didn't stay in cricket writing beyond that decade, but

02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:26.560
[Amit Varma]: many of the other guys are just absolutely top class writers today. And later, of course,

02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:30.120
[Amit Varma]: Sharda joined him and Jayaditya joined him and it was just a great team.

02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:34.560
[Guest]: No, I think Sambit has been outstanding as an editor for Crickinfo. And also, I think

02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:40.600
[Guest]: for the fact that he steered Crickinfo to a position of eminence, not just because it's

02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:45.280
[Guest]: a repository of all the data that you want in cricket, but also for the quality of its

02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:51.240
[Guest]: writing. And as you mentioned that, he was like a magnet attracting young talent. I think

02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:58.040
[Guest]: largely because of his temperament, he's got a great temperament. I think he's hugely secure

02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:03.000
[Guest]: as an editor. So, he's not worried about, am I writing, is somebody else writing better

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.760
[Guest]: than me and therefore what will happen? I think he's interested, I think in that sense

02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:13.960
[Guest]: he's a visionary. So, he's promoted a lot of very talented youngsters to become formidable

02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:19.040
[Guest]: names. Siddharth Maunga, for instance, who worked briefly with me in DNA and joined and

02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:25.440
[Guest]: he's, you know, gone places. So, at a global level, you know, and I think Sambit himself,

02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:28.760
[Guest]: he was very passionate. Sambit and I go back to Independent when I was Sports Editor of

02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:29.760
[Guest]: Independent briefly.

02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:30.760
[Amit Varma]: This is 1989.

02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:37.760
[Guest]: 1989, 1990, when he was on the civic beat. So, he was a BMC reporter and he was very

02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:45.040
[Guest]: young, much younger than me, 23, 24. And at that point in time, I didn't, I had no clue

02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:51.840
[Guest]: at all that he was so passionate about cricket. And then, of course, he joined Gentleman and

02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:58.320
[Guest]: edited Gentleman at a very young age. So, I mean, he is inheritor of a legacy in journalism,

02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:06.960
[Guest]: you know, his family from Odisha was into media. So, some values he's imbibed very early.

02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:12.380
[Guest]: I would imagine, I've never met, apart from his brother, I've met not many other people.

02:26:12.380 --> 02:26:17.520
[Guest]: But I think the very strong values of editorial freedom, independence, these are very strong

02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:24.720
[Guest]: values in him. And also looking at reporters and writers in a very humane way and creating

02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:29.040
[Guest]: opportunities for everybody to grow. That's my surmise, not that we've had great discussions

02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:32.720
[Guest]: on this, but seeing the trajectory of his own career, I think he's done an absolutely

02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:39.440
[Guest]: fabulous job. And he himself has grown tremendously as a writer, not just an editor, but also

02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:44.920
[Guest]: as a writer, you know, and somebody and what I think has perhaps helped him the most is

02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:53.440
[Guest]: his immediate understanding that technology is going to drive journalism or writing going

02:26:53.440 --> 02:27:00.520
[Guest]: ahead. So, he's been amongst the first I remember, or amongst people I know, who immersed himself

02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:07.320
[Guest]: into understanding where technology is going and, you know, use that as expanding the horizons

02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:12.000
[Guest]: of influence of Click Info and for his writers and for himself.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.920
[Amit Varma]: And besides being a lovely man, what I realized about what a good editor he was is, in retrospect,

02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:20.280
[Amit Varma]: having worked with him for many years, kind of one of the things that I've learned looking

02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:27.520
[Amit Varma]: back is that a good editor first and foremost must be an enabler of good people. He had

02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:32.000
[Amit Varma]: a bunch of talented young writers with him, but he didn't try to force a particular way

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:38.040
[Amit Varma]: of writing or a style or any of that on them. He allowed them space to make their mistakes

02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:43.440
[Amit Varma]: and to grow. Like I remember at the time that I began with him, I was a typical flamboyant

02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:48.240
[Unknown]: young writer, I want to show off my skills, the fancy turn of phrase, all of that and

02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:52.680
[Amit Varma]: you learn with experience. And rather than whip me into submission, he allowed me to

02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:58.360
[Amit Varma]: play some of my shorts to, you know, to smoothen that out. And in that sense, a very nurturing

02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:04.320
[Amit Varma]: editor in a way that perhaps kind of goes unseen, but to kind of get back to your sort

02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:08.040
[Amit Varma]: of story, the last 12 years you've been on your own. Now, one of the things I realized

02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:12.640
[Amit Varma]: after I did my last sort of full time job, which was at Click Info, after that I was

02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:17.320
[Amit Varma]: a consulting editor with them for a couple of years, but I was kind of out of there for

02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:22.520
[Amit Varma]: by 2009. And after that, I kind of realized that I can never do a job again. Because once

02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:26.280
[Amit Varma]: you have the freedom of working for yourself, which is such a great privilege, if you can

02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:31.480
[Amit Varma]: manage it, I realized ki nahi hoga aur main office nahi jaasakta, register sign nahi kar

02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:35.680
[Amit Varma]: sakta and all of that crap. You know, what are the pros and cons for you? What was sort

02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:37.640
[Guest]: of the solo life for you as it were?

02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:41.080
[Guest]: So initially, I must confess that it was a little difficult, you know, I like while I

02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:45.440
[Guest]: made that choice consciously, I felt the pangs, you know, I was missing newsroom because I

02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:53.120
[Guest]: just spent a long time in newsrooms, about 30 years. So it became a little initially

02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:59.320
[Guest]: a little difficult, then I found that I had more elbow room, I had more, you know, I was

02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:04.240
[Guest]: more convenienced by my time being my own, of course, you have to manage the time well,

02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:08.920
[Guest]: and you have to get enough assignments that can sometimes become a bit of a problem. And

02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:12.120
[Guest]: then after you've got the assignments, you have to ensure that the money keeps coming

02:29:12.120 --> 02:29:17.960
[Guest]: in otherwise that becomes a bigger problem. So the flow of income can become a little,

02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:22.560
[Guest]: the pattern can be irregular, but they're not, there will be defaulters. But as yet,

02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:28.720
[Guest]: I would say that by and large, I haven't been kind of shafted, you know, I haven't been,

02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:36.640
[Guest]: you know, troubled too much. So in that sense, if your livelihood is looked after, your professional

02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:41.600
[Guest]: assignments give you the reach and the exposure that you've enjoyed, ultimately, that's what,

02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:46.640
[Guest]: you know, there's a certain vanity, if you might call it, that I'm reaching out and so

02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:51.280
[Guest]: many people are reading it, and sometimes you get the feedback, if that is met, then

02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:57.000
[Guest]: you don't, you start missing the newsroom less and less, except for the old style companionship

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:03.280
[Guest]: of being in a new, you know, in times of India, the newsroom would be 150-200 people, the

02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:09.480
[Guest]: floor. Even in DNA, when we started 200 people, so you don't have that many people around

02:30:09.480 --> 02:30:14.560
[Guest]: you now, you know, you're probably alone. Or if you're in a commentary stand, maybe

02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:23.080
[Guest]: you've got 7, 8, 10 people. So there is a sense of, you know, that is a, in a way, it

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:26.440
[Guest]: gets a little lonely, but you have to come to terms with it, and then you start enjoying

02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:32.120
[Guest]: it. You find that you're able to spend a little more time outside, because if you're in an

02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:36.080
[Guest]: office, then you're spending, yes, you got 200 people, but you get sucked into all kinds

02:30:36.080 --> 02:30:41.680
[Guest]: of things, which may actually be adding not much value to your life, apart from, you know,

02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:49.200
[Guest]: just being together. So that I think has been something and also see, I'm not 25-26, where

02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:54.680
[Guest]: you need that kind of, you know, very busy life involved with everybody else. At this

02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:58.840
[Guest]: stage of my life, I'm quite happy being on my own and doing the stuff that I want to

02:30:58.840 --> 02:31:04.120
[Guest]: do. And if I keep getting decent assignments, I'm, what more can one ask for?

02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:07.080
[Amit Varma]: You know, I had Veer Sanghvi on my show a few weeks ago. And one of the things that

02:31:07.080 --> 02:31:11.760
[Amit Varma]: he pointed out was that once you become an editor, it's very seductive, you want to be

02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:15.680
[Amit Varma]: an editor forever, because of everything that kind of goes with it. And I would imagine

02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:20.120
[Amit Varma]: that all the offers that came to you would be at approximately that level, that will,

02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:24.200
[Amit Varma]: will you be an editor? And it, you know, did it get tempting at some times? Were there

02:31:24.200 --> 02:31:28.720
[Amit Varma]: times where you just sat back and said, I'm doing this trivial thing myself, some secretary

02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:30.000
[Amit Varma]: would have done it for me?

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:34.160
[Guest]: Absolutely. That is the biggest, see, there are two things, you know, Veer is right. And

02:31:34.160 --> 02:31:40.600
[Guest]: I'll tell you what the pangs are really, without kind of mincing words, there's a sense of

02:31:40.600 --> 02:31:47.720
[Guest]: absence of power. So, when you're an editor, whatever the scale of the organization, you

02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:53.320
[Guest]: know, it's like you're the centrifugal force, everything flows in and out from the editor's

02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:58.280
[Guest]: cabin, the power at least of how the newsroom runs, there'll be various people working towards

02:31:58.280 --> 02:32:06.000
[Guest]: it. But so that absence of power can, can take, you know, it can, you can feel it. You

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:11.360
[Guest]: can, it's a captain of a team, cricket team, you remove that person from the captaincy,

02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:16.240
[Guest]: it takes a long while for that player to get readjusted to being just an ordinary member.

02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:24.900
[Guest]: So that absence you feel and yeah, but, but beyond, so the other paraphernalia that comes

02:32:24.900 --> 02:32:28.960
[Guest]: along with it, it's not just the power, but it's also the conveniences. You have a Secchi,

02:32:28.960 --> 02:32:32.320
[Guest]: you will do all kinds of things for you. Now, you know, if I have to book an air ticket,

02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:37.800
[Guest]: I have to do it myself. You know, if I have to get five phone calls back to back, I have

02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:42.800
[Guest]: to keep doing it myself with somebody I could have just told my secretary, you know, these

02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:47.400
[Guest]: are, this is the time, just make sure you give me the calls. So all those conveniences

02:32:47.400 --> 02:32:54.000
[Guest]: also become a bit of a problem when they are gone. But hey, this is, you know, it's now

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:59.160
[Guest]: new age and you have to adjust. And now, in fact, post-pandemic, I think more and more

02:32:59.160 --> 02:33:03.720
[Guest]: people are beginning to realize that you have to, you know, people have become actually

02:33:03.720 --> 02:33:08.600
[Guest]: more independent because they're sitting and working from home. And therefore, they have

02:33:08.600 --> 02:33:14.800
[Guest]: to extend that sense now rather than clamoring or craving for, I mean, ultimately all sense

02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:20.320
[Guest]: of power at the end of it is delusionary. It is there, well, it is there, once it goes

02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:24.600
[Guest]: and we don't even know how much power, what people said behind your back and whether everybody

02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:31.720
[Guest]: did what you thought is also a sense of, it's a delusion, you know, it could be. So, I think

02:33:31.720 --> 02:33:35.720
[Guest]: you have to reconcile. Reconciliation in life is one of the great things, you know, you

02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:40.040
[Guest]: have to reconcile to so many things. So, you have to reconcile to also the fact that there

02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:47.120
[Guest]: is a time where, you know, you climb up and you reach a certain level and there will be

02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:53.000
[Guest]: a time when you don't have that. And it doesn't mean that what you've lost is something that

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:56.640
[Guest]: will debilitate you to an extent where you lose your identity completely.

02:33:56.640 --> 02:34:01.600
[Amit Varma]: A couple of other thoughts strike me. One is that at the level of, you know, being an

02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:07.040
[Amit Varma]: editor, you've got managerial responsibility, you are sort of multitasking, you're juggling

02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:11.000
[Amit Varma]: various balls. And, you know, Cal Newport wrote this book called Deep Work where he

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:14.760
[Amit Varma]: talks about deep work and shallow work. And deep work is typically when you really need

02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:19.200
[Amit Varma]: to get into the zone and you need to write. And every time you're distracted, it takes

02:34:19.200 --> 02:34:24.320
[Amit Varma]: you 15 minutes or 20 minutes to get back into a state of deep work. So, if we open ourselves

02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:28.520
[Amit Varma]: up to distractions, like from our smartphone or whatever, we can perennially be in a state

02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:32.200
[Amit Varma]: of shallow work and never really get deep. Now, his point is that for a manager, that

02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:35.720
[Amit Varma]: is okay, because you are doing shallow work anyway, you're coordinating things, you're

02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:39.120
[Amit Varma]: looking at timelines, you're talking to one department head, what are the stories for

02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:42.800
[Amit Varma]: today, what do we run with, blah, blah, blah, that's perfectly fine. But when you're working

02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:47.280
[Amit Varma]: for yourself, ideally, the balance shifts a little bit, you want to do more writing,

02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:52.240
[Amit Varma]: you want to do more reading, you want to focus more on that. So, one, how was that shift

02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:58.240
[Amit Varma]: for you? And two, how would you then give your day structure? Like what I have found

02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:03.440
[Amit Varma]: hardest working for myself is just meeting internal deadlines. Like if somebody else

02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:07.800
[Amit Varma]: gives me a deadline, I can meet it, I will panic. You know, as Douglas Adams once said

02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:12.960
[Amit Varma]: deadlines, I love deadlines, especially the sound they make as I go whooshing by. So,

02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:17.280
[Amit Varma]: so I can panic, but the deadline helps. But when I have to be internally driven, I find

02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:21.360
[Amit Varma]: it really hard to structure my day to get work done. How are those for you? How did

02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:22.360
[Guest]: you manage?

02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:27.960
[Guest]: So I have the same problem. I mean, the internal, you know, deadline, kind of pattern, how do

02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:32.160
[Guest]: you put it in place is really the challenge. And then I think this has also to do with

02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:36.360
[Guest]: personality types. There are some people who will, I've got a deadline to meet, let me

02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:41.160
[Guest]: just get it out of the way. And it's out of the way, you know, while I'll mull over things

02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:48.840
[Guest]: and I'll be, I mean, at the end of the day, one is conscious of deadlines. And in newspapers,

02:35:48.840 --> 02:35:54.200
[Guest]: you'll find that most, and you've been a writer all your life also. So you, the deadline

02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:59.960
[Guest]: is when it's almost, you know, on the precipice. Now I have to deliver. So you might mull over

02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:03.400
[Guest]: as much as you want. But if you're a professional journalist, there's a deadline you have to

02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:09.880
[Guest]: meet and give it, you know, so I think that you internalize it. And you, if it is somebody

02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:13.520
[Guest]: who's given you a four hour deadline saying, I'm, I want this piece, because I have to

02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:18.000
[Guest]: put it out by two o'clock in the afternoon, you have to finish it by 12. And you're told

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:21.680
[Guest]: at eight in the morning, you will strive and put it together and do it. But if somebody

02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:27.640
[Guest]: says, I want 2000 words, and, you know, give it to me in three days, I doubt that somebody

02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:32.880
[Guest]: will do it on, I can't do it on the first day. Unlikely on the second day also, I may

02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:39.480
[Guest]: make a few notes and keep it, or I might mull over it in the mind. And inevitably, it'll

02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:44.520
[Guest]: be done on the third day. So managing those internal deadlines is an issue, especially

02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:50.800
[Guest]: when you are also doing sundry other things, but because you're alone. So, in my case,

02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:56.040
[Guest]: and I'm sure it's true of many people who are writers now still, is that you're juggling

02:36:56.040 --> 02:37:00.520
[Guest]: with two or three assignments. And therefore, you're working out in your mind all the time,

02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:05.520
[Guest]: which is priority, deadline, which is I can hedge a little bit, and how do I meet all

02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:13.120
[Guest]: three. And that, you know, that is something that you have to crack, you know. So, and

02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:17.600
[Guest]: even amongst editors, so I think what you're talking about the editors, those category

02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:22.200
[Guest]: of, that category of editors are those who are writers, who've been managers also, but

02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:26.440
[Guest]: who are also writers. There are also lots of production editors today in newspapers,

02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:30.600
[Guest]: you know, who don't write. Their job still remains managerial, suppose they might become

02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:36.320
[Guest]: a consulting editor somewhere, but it's not about writing. So, I think it's a different

02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:41.120
[Guest]: yardstick which would apply for them rather than for people like us, who are still writers.

02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:45.320
[Amit Varma]: Fair point. Now, I think we come to the part of the show where we should talk about the

02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:50.000
[Amit Varma]: journey of Indian cricket, which is what your book is about, much of which you have witnessed

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:55.200
[Amit Varma]: in your storied career. So, let's go back to your 1983 experience, because that is a

02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:59.960
[Amit Varma]: truly seminal moment. That's when the world begins to change forever, basically, not to

02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:04.740
[Amit Varma]: be too hyperbolic about it. So, tell me a bit about that, because what I find interesting

02:38:04.740 --> 02:38:09.600
[Amit Varma]: there is that there is this world event, and there are six Indian journalists there. And

02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:15.920
[Amit Varma]: you are one of those six Indian journalists. And because you are on a budget, you are also,

02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:19.820
[Amit Varma]: you know, taking great care. So, you missed the first India-West Indies match because

02:38:19.820 --> 02:38:24.360
[Guest]: you'd have to travel for it. I missed the first for two reasons. One is that I was,

02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:29.800
[Guest]: you know, short on money. I mean, I didn't have money to splurge or even spend, not extravagantly,

02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:33.640
[Guest]: but more than is necessary. But I also missed it because I thought India is going to get

02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:37.960
[Guest]: licked by West Indies in the first match. So, I have to go to Old Trafford, train fair,

02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:42.920
[Guest]: night, I have to stay there for the match. And, you know, hotel, I was in YMCA in London.

02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:47.140
[Guest]: And I said, let me go to the Oval where England and New Zealand were playing. And this looks

02:38:47.140 --> 02:38:51.720
[Guest]: like an interesting match. And, you know, because New Zealand had two earlier World

02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:56.280
[Guest]: Cups had finished in the semi-finals. And they had a young player called Martin Crowe,

02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:01.160
[Guest]: who I had come, you know, kind of come to like just reading about his exploits as a

02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:06.000
[Guest]: junior when he had started out playing in English county. So, I said, let me go and

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:10.840
[Guest]: watch Martin Crowe and England versus New Zealand rather than go to, you know, predictable

02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:19.000
[Guest]: result. So, there I went. But while this match was on, the Oval match, New Zealand-England,

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:24.120
[Guest]: we got information coming in, radio and other that India was really putting up a stiff fight

02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:29.240
[Guest]: against West Indies. That match spilled over into the next day because of rain. And India

02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:33.720
[Guest]: won the next morning. But of course, by then, it was too late to go to Old Trafford.

02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:41.560
[Guest]: But the only thing which I realized as a professional thing, not because of the World Cup, is that,

02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:48.360
[Guest]: is, you know, you can't fudge on your professional assignment. You're there to do a certain job.

02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:53.000
[Guest]: It's like taking your eyes off the ball. You'll find your thumbs going for a walk. So, I should

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:59.000
[Guest]: have been, that was my biggest, I should have been with India instead of being self-indulgent

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:04.920
[Guest]: and going to watch New Zealand versus England. But that was the start of a terrific campaign.

02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:09.880
[Guest]: So, I missed the first match. And then I didn't miss a ball of every match that India played

02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:16.440
[Amit Varma]: after that. So, after that, you saw a match which I can only envy that you actually watched it,

02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:21.400
[Amit Varma]: which is, of course, that famous Stranbridge Wells match where BBC went on strike for one day.

02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:25.240
[Amit Varma]: And that was a day that one of the greatest innings of all time was played when Kapil

02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:30.600
[Amit Varma]: Dev made 175. Tell me a bit about what that whole experience was like going to the game,

02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:34.680
[Guest]: watching that innings. So, the first thing about that I must tell you is that I reached a little

02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:42.120
[Guest]: late. You know, again, trying to save money. So, I was staying in a place in Surbiton in Surrey

02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:46.920
[Guest]: with a friend of somebody who I knew from Bombay. He was an engineer and, you know, where I could

02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:51.960
[Guest]: save on room rent. And then I took an off-peak ticket to Stranbridge Wells because that would

02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:59.800
[Guest]: be half the fare. So, I reached maybe about 20 minutes, 25 minutes after start of play,

02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:06.440
[Guest]: running up to the ground. As I entered the ground, the Indian dressing room was right on the right

02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:10.920
[Guest]: and it had a little porch. And I saw Gundappa Vishwanath standing there. He was not in the team,

02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:16.520
[Guest]: obviously, but he was there. And I said hi to him and I sidled up. I mean, in those days,

02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:21.080
[Guest]: nobody stopped you. So, I sidled up to him and I said, how's it going? So, he says,

02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:26.440
[Guest]: no, no, nothing to worry about. So, I said, what is he talking about nothing to worry about?

02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:31.880
[Guest]: And then I went to the scoreboard and it was like four wickets had gone, you know,

02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:38.200
[Guest]: 11 or 12 or 4. I said, what the hell is happening? You know, then I stood there with him for the

02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:44.040
[Guest]: next maybe 7, 8 overs. It became 17 for 5. Kapil Dev was already in the middle. India's top order

02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:49.000
[Guest]: had been knocked off. It was a devilish pitch, you know, the ball seeming around a lot.

02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:58.600
[Guest]: And I stood there till about, for about half an hour, till I found that things were settling a

02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:04.200
[Guest]: bit. And Kapil started playing his strokes. And then I went to the, what was the, the press box

02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:10.200
[Guest]: was the Shamiana. Well, and the crowd, you know, it was a packed ground, maybe 5, 6,000 people,

02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:16.520
[Guest]: most of them old age pensioners, you know, small county and picnic, you know, like a picnic for

02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:25.000
[Guest]: them. And, you know, just it became so dramatic once he started going that he was peppering the

02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:32.840
[Guest]: ground with boundaries and sixes. And, you know, suddenly he was 175 not out. India had made 262,

02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:41.080
[Guest]: something that and went on to win the match. And it became a, I mean, the feeling that something

02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:49.560
[Guest]: extraordinary has happened was immediately felt. Now, obviously, one was winning the match from a

02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:55.080
[Guest]: near impossible situation. But suddenly one felt, or at least this is the impression I still carry

02:42:55.080 --> 02:43:01.320
[Guest]: in my mind is, you know, some transformation has taken place. This is not the same team.

02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:05.320
[Guest]: The team had been a little up and down till then. And we're on the verge of being, you know,

02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:09.960
[Guest]: Gavaskar had missed out on a couple of matches. There was whether he's dropped. And the stories

02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:14.360
[Guest]: we were chasing is, has Gavaskar been dropped? You know, he didn't play a couple of matches.

02:43:14.360 --> 02:43:19.480
[Guest]: Then he came back. So, you know, there was always this thing, Gavaskar versus Kapil Dev,

02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:23.320
[Guest]: kya ho raha hai, pata nahi hai. Nobody thought India was in this World Cup to win it.

02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:28.760
[Guest]: But after that Tonbridge Wells match, things transformed. And six of us also,

02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:32.360
[Guest]: the journalists who were there, we got a little more excited about founding,

02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:38.680
[Guest]: finding out what else, you know, what next. And then we went to Chelmsford, beat Australia.

02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:44.760
[Guest]: Then Old Trafford, where we beat England. That to me was a terrific match. It was a fantastic

02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:49.720
[Guest]: match to watch and experience because England were favourites to be in the final along with

02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:57.480
[Guest]: West Indies. And, you know, all kinds of desis were there based in England. There's a lot of,

02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:02.920
[Guest]: not just banter, but also a lot of, you know, tutu-meh-meh going on between the people.

02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:07.800
[Guest]: Kapil Dev eats botham for breakfast, was the placard, very famous placard. Kapil Dev

02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:13.000
[Guest]: eats botham for breakfast. And then India beat England in that match. And then was the final.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:21.000
[Guest]: And again, you know, as the story of my World Cup, I woke up a little late in Surbiton,

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:26.040
[Guest]: which was like an hour or so away. And I said, shit, you know, it's the final of the match.

02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:32.120
[Guest]: And I counted my money. I said, I'm taking a cab and going. And that was the big mistake I made.

02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:39.160
[Guest]: Because you try and come by a cab in London, it takes far longer than tube and, you know,

02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:44.200
[Guest]: connections and whatever. And apart from costing you an arm and a leg. So, when I landed up,

02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:51.960
[Guest]: running past Grace Gates, and there's a roar. And a very West Indian roar. You could make out

02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:58.440
[Guest]: it's a West Indian roar. So, I, you know, the press box was, I think, three stories up. And

02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:01.480
[Guest]: there's an elevator, which I couldn't wait for. I just asked the guy, what happened?

02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:07.640
[Guest]: Gavaskar is out, you know. So, I'm running up. And Richie Benoit is coming down. I think he was

02:45:07.640 --> 02:45:13.240
[Guest]: moving between some assignment radio to television or whatever. I had met him earlier in one of the

02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:18.440
[Guest]: grounds. And he was, of course, Richie Benoit. And he said, I'm still offering you odds, you know,

02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:24.920
[Guest]: 60 to 1. 60 to 1 on India winning. 66 to 1. At the start of the tournament, he said,

02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:27.400
[Guest]: I'm still offering you that. Please tell me you put some money on it.

02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:29.480
[Guest]: I didn't put any money. I said, 10 pounds will go.

02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:38.120
[Guest]: Why lose 10 pounds? I've already paid 40 some quid for taxi. And I'm bust. So, I went on,

02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:41.800
[Guest]: I went up and sat in the press box. And, of course, we all know what happened in that match.

02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:48.280
[Guest]: The press box in those days was at long leg, at one side, not behind the bowler's arm. So,

02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:53.480
[Guest]: we had a complete view of the ground, but not the vertical view, so to speak.

02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:53.980
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:45:54.840 --> 02:46:02.120
[Guest]: But the match as it transpired, you know, it just, I don't think that till the last wicket fell,

02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:06.840
[Guest]: the West Indian supporters were convinced that they were going to lose. You can see that now

02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:10.280
[Guest]: when you look at the footage, there's Michael Hogan, there's Michael Hogan, there's Richie

02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:13.960
[Guest]: when you look at the footage, there's Michael Holding who gets out and there's some supporters

02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:18.120
[Guest]: who run to the ground. One of them is like almost cajoling him, you come back, how could he lose

02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:24.680
[Guest]: this match, you know, lose to India. And then there was a Shamiana for Prudential where I went

02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:29.800
[Guest]: and couple of days, of course, I think the first time I saw a couple of little tipsy, he must have

02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:34.920
[Guest]: had a champagne, maybe a couple of glasses of champagne before I reached there. But very few

02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:39.640
[Guest]: West Indian players, they were pissed off as hell. I saw Clive Lloyd and Desmond Haynes,

02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:43.560
[Guest]: two guys I can remember, maybe Michael Holding, three of them, but not the others,

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:48.120
[Guest]: certainly not Viv Richards, I didn't see him because his wicket was the turning point.

02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:55.400
[Guest]: But it was the greatest experience of my life as a sports writer and a cricket writer,

02:46:55.400 --> 02:46:59.560
[Guest]: seeing India win the World Cup at that point in time, I was 27. And I said,

02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:04.760
[Guest]: boss, yeah, you know, this high, I will never get if I do law or whatever else,

02:47:04.760 --> 02:47:10.520
[Guest]: you know, so forget about law. Let's, you know, let's get into journalism. So, I came back and

02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:17.480
[Guest]: I met my boss, who was Sharath Kotnes, who was the editor of Sportsweek magazine. And I told him,

02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:21.960
[Guest]: I'm going to quit after this World Cup. So, he said, and he was, you know,

02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:26.760
[Guest]: abhi kya hai, what is your thought now? I said, I'm going to work as a journalist,

02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:31.400
[Guest]: but I need more money. You know, I can't survive on the money you're paying me,

02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:36.280
[Guest]: 800 bucks or whatever it was then, 1983. So, he gave me a raise immediately,

02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:42.120
[Guest]: which kind of convinced me that I made the right, my right decision because, you know,

02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:46.680
[Guest]: 1200, 1300 bucks in those days meant a lot. I was not even sure if I would make that much in

02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:51.800
[Guest]: law practice, maybe subsequently. But at that point in time, at least it paid for my bike's

02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:58.040
[Guest]: petrol and looked after me and my wife and my very young son reasonably well. So, I said fine.

02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:03.240
[Amit Varma]: It kind of strikes me like I keep talking in different contexts about the importance of

02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:07.400
[Amit Varma]: probabilistic thinking. And I feel that enough people don't do it when they look at cricket.

02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:11.640
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, we now look back at 83. And with the benefit of hindsight, everything that

02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:16.600
[Amit Varma]: has already happened seemed inevitable. So, now it seems like 1983 was destiny.

02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:20.840
[Amit Varma]: India was destined to win it. The way I look at it is different. The way I look at it is that

02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:24.360
[Amit Varma]: Richie Benoist's odds to you of 60 to 1 might even have been the correct ones, who knows.

02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:24.840
[Unknown]: Absolutely.

02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:31.560
[Amit Varma]: But it turned out to be the 1 in 61 times that India actually wins. So, extremely sort of lucky

02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:35.720
[Amit Varma]: in that sense. Like once when I was writing a column on poker for Economic Times, one of my

02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:40.360
[Amit Varma]: pieces had the headline, unlikely is inevitable. You know, the law of truly large numbers says that

02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:45.880
[Amit Varma]: if you have enough number of iterations, unlikely things are likely to happen. It's just the way it

02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:53.640
[Amit Varma]: is. And the way I kind of ask people to visualize probability is that you flip a coin and imagine

02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:58.360
[Amit Varma]: that immediately the world splits into two parallel universes. And then one of them is heads

02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:03.160
[Amit Varma]: and the other one is tails. And so on infinitely down the line. And in that one parallel universe,

02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:07.160
[Amit Varma]: we win. But in many more parallel universes, honestly, West Indies wins.

02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:07.560
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:12.600
[Amit Varma]: In some England wins. I don't think Zimbabwe wins in any, but otherwise you have it kind of spread

02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:18.600
[Amit Varma]: out on who wins. Now, that leads me to thinking is that that moment is incredibly seminal because

02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:24.200
[Amit Varma]: of what follows. Like number one, Dalmia, Bindra and NKP Salve are pissed off that they didn't get

02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:27.480
[Amit Varma]: enough tickets. They were treated badly. And they're like, what the hell, we won the World

02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:32.840
[Amit Varma]: Cup. Agla wala India mein hoga. And therefore that shifts. And the next World Cup is in India.

02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:38.040
[Amit Varma]: And then liberalization happens. And commerce dictates the rest of what happens. And eventually

02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:43.000
[Amit Varma]: over a period of time, India becomes the center of world cricket as it is today. And all of it

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:47.880
[Amit Varma]: started with that one little thing. And had we not won that, had we not been in that parallel

02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:52.120
[Amit Varma]: universe where India actually wins a damn thing, you know, all of this may not have happened.

02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:56.120
[Guest]: You've kind of put it very briefly, but I can tell you, I can expand it a little.

02:49:56.120 --> 02:49:56.440
[Guest]: Please, please.

02:49:56.440 --> 02:50:00.280
[Guest]: I mean, India wouldn't have been the power it is in cricket today, but for the 83 victory.

02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:04.600
[Guest]: And let me explain why. One is obviously the impact it had on the Indian psyche,

02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:08.360
[Guest]: you know, and suddenly you felt like champions. And that's a major boost

02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:13.880
[Guest]: in the feel good factor for the country. You know, I mean, sport is soft power, as we know,

02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:19.240
[Guest]: and that really and cricket is such a passion. So, it happened. But also what happened was

02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:23.640
[Guest]: Dalmia and Salve and Bindra being denied those extra passes and, you know, they

02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:32.920
[Guest]: just kind of bruised their ego so badly. So, what happened subsequently? To shift the World Cup

02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:39.000
[Guest]: from England to the subcontinent was not easy. They had to tie up with Pakistan Cricket Board.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:47.480
[Guest]: So, NKP Salve and Air Marshal Retired Noor Khan, who was the PCB Chief or BPCC, as it was called

02:50:47.480 --> 02:50:56.520
[Guest]: then, Board of BCCP, you know, they connived, they worked out friendship with each other, because

02:50:58.520 --> 02:51:04.440
[Guest]: it wasn't possible to hold all, there was not enough stadia in India for a World Cup.

02:51:04.440 --> 02:51:10.760
[Guest]: These were the objections raised by the lobby of England, Australia, New Zealand,

02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:17.960
[Guest]: even the West Indies, which used to traditionally align with that block. So, India, Pakistan,

02:51:17.960 --> 02:51:22.600
[Guest]: Sri Lanka and the associate countries, they had to win over. And without Pakistan's help,

02:51:22.600 --> 02:51:29.240
[Guest]: it wouldn't have been possible. So, the governments had to be involved. So, Rajiv Gandhi and Zia-ul-Haq

02:51:29.240 --> 02:51:37.560
[Guest]: had to be involved. And they had to restrict the number of overs from 60 to 50, because of,

02:51:38.120 --> 02:51:45.000
[Guest]: you know, the twilight situation in India. And that the objection was from, you know, the

02:51:45.960 --> 02:51:52.200
[Guest]: TCCB and MCC and whoever else, the World Cup, that World Cup organizers, Prudential, that how

02:51:52.200 --> 02:51:58.840
[Guest]: can you have a 60-over tournament reduced to 50 overs? So, the one counter to that was double

02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:05.160
[Guest]: everything, the money, which Dalmia was very good at. When nothing works, money works. So,

02:52:05.160 --> 02:52:10.760
[Guest]: everybody's monies were doubled. Whatever happened in 83, everything, the finances were doubled.

02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:15.640
[Guest]: So, Pakistan and India collaborating to get the World Cup to the subcontinent,

02:52:15.640 --> 02:52:20.360
[Guest]: it is held jointly between India and Pakistan. Subsequently, also it happened in 96. But the

02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:26.280
[Guest]: two countries were not, you know, it had become a little inimical to each other. So, but

02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:32.440
[Guest]: overs reduced, money doubled, and the World Cup comes to the subcontinent. In my opinion,

02:52:32.440 --> 02:52:36.920
[Guest]: amongst the greatest World Cups that have been played. India didn't win, Pakistan didn't win.

02:52:36.920 --> 02:52:42.280
[Guest]: They were the two favorites. It didn't happen. Australia beat England in the final at Eden

02:52:42.280 --> 02:52:50.520
[Guest]: Gardens. 90,000 people plus turned up, which made India the Mecca of cricket, in my opinion. That is

02:52:50.520 --> 02:52:57.640
[Guest]: a turning point. And of course, after the IPL started and everything else, it's also become the El Dorado.

02:52:58.440 --> 02:53:03.800
[Amit Varma]: And it's worth stating again that in these tribal times, 90,000 people turned up to watch a match

02:53:03.800 --> 02:53:07.560
[Guest]: that did not involve their country. It didn't involve their country. It was amazing. It was

02:53:07.560 --> 02:53:12.360
[Guest]: absolutely, I mean, it was astounding. And that's what, I mean, Calcutta got its, you know, charm

02:53:12.360 --> 02:53:17.480
[Guest]: as a cricketing center from there. And, you know, the Calcutta fandom, as we go, you know, whatever

02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:23.080
[Guest]: it is, the mindset of the Calcuttans now, why they are so passionate and crazy about sports,

02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:25.480
[Guest]: that's a story in itself. And then, of course, India is…

02:53:25.480 --> 02:53:27.880
[Amit Varma]: Some could argue too passionate given 96.

02:53:27.880 --> 02:53:35.000
[Guest]: Too passionate. But by 87, and then, of course, we are approaching liberalization and

02:53:35.640 --> 02:53:41.080
[Guest]: cable TV penetration starts happening. You know, that's where the influence,

02:53:41.080 --> 02:53:47.480
[Guest]: subsequently, of Marc Mascareñas comes in. Broadcast rights start getting valued far more.

02:53:47.480 --> 02:53:54.760
[Guest]: Liberalization, opening up of the airwaves, broadcast, and therefore, the valuation going up

02:53:54.760 --> 02:54:00.760
[Guest]: of cricket rights all happened within that 4, 5, 6 years, starting from 87. If the 87 World Cup had

02:54:00.760 --> 02:54:06.840
[Guest]: bombed, then things could have been different. But 87 World Cup only happened…

02:54:06.840 --> 02:54:07.560
[Guest]: Because 83.

02:54:07.560 --> 02:54:14.680
[Guest]: Because 83 happened. So, you know, if you trace back the monumental growth of cricket in India,

02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:22.280
[Guest]: not just in terms of passion and coverage and all, but also in finances, it all goes back to 83.

02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:25.400
[Amit Varma]: I sort of remember this vague story about how in the early 90s,

02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:30.120
[Amit Varma]: when BCCI wanted Doordarshan to broadcast their matches, Doordarshan said,

02:54:30.120 --> 02:54:32.120
[Amit Varma]: how much money will you give us to broadcast the matches?

02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:37.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, just imagine what a shift in mindset then subsequently kind of happened.

02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:39.320
[Guest]: Absolutely. I mean, you had to pay the broadcaster.

02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:43.160
[Guest]: The cricket board had to pay the broadcaster rather than the other way around.

02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:47.240
[Amit Varma]: Insane. Absolutely insane. And you mentioned Indira Gandhi. And I just remembered another

02:54:47.240 --> 02:54:51.720
[Amit Varma]: of these memories, which are like these childhood memories. And again, I was around 10 at the time,

02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:56.760
[Amit Varma]: that India was playing a one-day match. And my favorite batsman at the time, Dilip Engsarkar,

02:54:56.760 --> 02:55:02.920
[Amit Varma]: was, I think, approaching his 100. And he had this long, frustrating relationship with an ODI 100

02:55:02.920 --> 02:55:07.800
[Amit Varma]: till he finally got one and then he got more. But this was, I think, before he had his first ODI 100.

02:55:07.800 --> 02:55:13.240
[Amit Varma]: And he was, I think, approaching 90s. And Sandeep Patil was playing a blazing innings.

02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:15.480
[Guest]: Yes, I was there. I was there at that match.

02:55:15.480 --> 02:55:17.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And I actually thought that the way Patil is growing,

02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:20.760
[Amit Varma]: maybe he can also get a 100 because he was just blazing away.

02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:24.040
[Amit Varma]: And then came the news that Mrs. Gandhi had died and the match was called off.

02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:27.560
[Guest]: Yes, we were in Pakistan, Sialkot. This is a match at Sialkot.

02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:33.880
[Guest]: And the test series had been very dreary. There was a lot of excitement coming up for this one-day

02:55:33.880 --> 02:55:39.800
[Guest]: series and especially because India was, you know, World Cup winners. So, and they started

02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:43.480
[Guest]: off very well. But this first match, the assassination news came in. And that night

02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:49.560
[Guest]: itself, Raj Singh Dungarpur was the manager. So, it was like pack-up time. And in Sialkot,

02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:53.480
[Guest]: we didn't even have hotels. We were staying in a guest room. I think the players also were staying

02:55:53.480 --> 02:56:01.080
[Guest]: in some, we were in a guest house and they were in some other, maybe a far more elaborate guest house.

02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:08.120
[Guest]: But it was back to India within 24 hours. From Sialkot to Karachi and then to Bombay.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:13.000
[Amit Varma]: So, I want to ask you about another shift that then happens. Like commercially,

02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:18.600
[Amit Varma]: everything changes. The center of the game begins to shift. But another interesting shift that

02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:24.520
[Amit Varma]: happens and that mirrors a change that happens in the country through the 90s is that the demographic

02:56:24.520 --> 02:56:30.280
[Amit Varma]: composition of the team changes in a sense. Like what we've had through the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s

02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:34.840
[Amit Varma]: is that you have these power centers. You have the Bombay School of Cricket and you have Delhi

02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:41.560
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, stray players from here and there. But it's not incredibly diverse. It's just sort

02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:49.640
[Amit Varma]: of these kind of pockets of influence. And then with liberalization, all of that changes in a very

02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:55.080
[Amit Varma]: drastic way. And the change is slow. You could say that the change truly manifests itself only today

02:56:55.080 --> 02:57:00.280
[Amit Varma]: or in recent years. Like I remember Harsha Bhogle did an episode with me where we sort of discussed

02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:05.320
[Amit Varma]: and I wonder what your thoughts are on it, on how so many young people who came up in Pakistan,

02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:11.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, you'd make your debut at 18 and you'd be burnt out and finished by 20. And part of the

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:17.240
[Amit Varma]: reason some could speculate is that in those days, in the 80s and 90s, the middle class in Pakistan

02:57:17.240 --> 02:57:21.880
[Amit Varma]: was really small. Either you were from the elites, but if you were a talented kid breaking down from

02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:27.880
[Amit Varma]: below, you weren't able to cope with the sudden fame and success and you didn't have that support

02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:34.840
[Amit Varma]: system. Whereas as Harsha said that through the, you know, 90s and aughties, you look at that whole

02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:41.160
[Amit Varma]: generation of Tendulkar, Dravid, Ganguly, Kumble, so on. I think the phrase Harsha used was middle

02:57:41.160 --> 02:57:48.120
[Amit Varma]: class values. And that in a sense also has shifted not in a bad way, but it has shifted in a good way

02:57:48.120 --> 02:57:53.560
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that people from small towns dominate the game today. You have inspirational success

02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:59.160
[Amit Varma]: stories like Mohammed Siraj and Shami and Tina Trajan, who are from really humble backgrounds

02:57:59.160 --> 02:58:04.440
[Amit Varma]: who are coming up. Tell me a little bit about how this change happened. Was there resistance to it?

02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:10.040
[Amit Varma]: Did the system kind of resist it at a certain point in time? And how did the ecosystem change

02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:14.680
[Guest]: and make it sort of possible for all of this to happen? So, I think there's been a fairly dramatic

02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:20.120
[Guest]: shift. I mean, there were the traditional centers, five, six of them, Mumbai or Bombay, Madras,

02:58:20.120 --> 02:58:25.800
[Guest]: Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi. Kanpur was a test center, though not such a great cricket center,

02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:32.120
[Guest]: but it was a test center and so on. So, I think that that started showing a shift from the 80s

02:58:32.120 --> 02:58:36.520
[Guest]: and Kapil Dev was one of the guys, you know, he became an iconic figure and therefore very

02:58:36.520 --> 02:58:42.600
[Guest]: influential, especially in the north, which was outside of Delhi, not so engaged in cricket.

02:58:42.600 --> 02:58:48.600
[Guest]: When I say north, it could also mean UP and Haryana and Punjab. And the gospel of cricket

02:58:48.600 --> 02:58:53.720
[Guest]: started spreading. And one of the things that while BCCI is much maligned for many things,

02:58:53.720 --> 02:58:58.040
[Guest]: for acts of omission and commission, and rightly so, but one of the things which they did,

02:58:58.040 --> 02:59:03.640
[Guest]: which other sports in India failed to do is spread the gospel of cricket across the length

02:59:03.640 --> 02:59:10.200
[Guest]: and breadth of the country and create, give enough infra, not the topmost, which has now happened.

02:59:10.200 --> 02:59:14.440
[Guest]: And, you know, we've got actually a surfeit of stadiums now, we don't need so many,

02:59:14.440 --> 02:59:23.720
[Guest]: but it's there. But decent enough facilities for smaller towns and more fossil areas to,

02:59:23.720 --> 02:59:31.560
[Guest]: you know, come and play there. So, the pipeline from very remote areas was established by the

02:59:31.560 --> 02:59:37.000
[Guest]: BCCI. And then the, you know, television spread the coverage around every home, people,

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:41.960
[Guest]: community television boxes, people watching matches and, you know, saying, hey, I can do this.

02:59:41.960 --> 02:59:48.440
[Guest]: The monetary rewards of cricket started rising and therefore it became an option, a very strong

02:59:48.440 --> 02:59:52.360
[Guest]: option for livelihood if you are good enough. Because the whole thing exploded with the IPL

02:59:52.360 --> 02:59:56.920
[Guest]: further, you know, there's been geometric progression since then, and now everybody

02:59:56.920 --> 03:00:01.320
[Guest]: wants to get into the IPL somehow or the other. The comparison with Pakistan is there, I think

03:00:01.320 --> 03:00:06.120
[Guest]: Harcha is right, but it stops at a certain stage because I think Pakistan's biggest problem has

03:00:06.120 --> 03:00:14.280
[Guest]: been the lack of a half-decent administration that can look after domestic cricket and therefore

03:00:14.280 --> 03:00:19.720
[Guest]: also cricketers. So, while they were, they've also produced fantastic talent, raw talent,

03:00:19.720 --> 03:00:25.000
[Guest]: they've not been able to nurture them for any great length of time or enough of them, you know.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:32.760
[Guest]: So, they produced great players in spite or despite the system not being so great. While India

03:00:32.760 --> 03:00:39.080
[Guest]: have been able to harness, especially in the last 30 years and produce and look after its

03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:43.480
[Guest]: cricketers much better, you know. And look at, there's been some thought also in this.

03:00:44.280 --> 03:00:48.120
[Guest]: Look at the preponderance of fast bowlers today. It was unthinkable. I mean,

03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:52.040
[Guest]: one of the biggest laments of Indian cricket has been that we don't have fast bowlers,

03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:56.520
[Guest]: except one couple, what will we do? We can't win overseas, we'll struggle.

03:00:56.520 --> 03:01:00.920
[Guest]: Today, you're spoiled for choice. You know, you've got so many fast bowlers. In fact,

03:01:00.920 --> 03:01:05.000
[Guest]: the problem today is batsmen are not making enough runs for fast bowlers to win your matches

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:11.400
[Guest]: overseas. And that has happened because the pitches have been made better for, you know,

03:01:11.400 --> 03:01:18.120
[Guest]: getting the fast bowlers to come and make their skills worthwhile. Not just spinning tracks,

03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:23.000
[Guest]: underprepared pitches, where you win a match in two and a half days and why should any fast

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:28.600
[Guest]: bowler make the effort? But now, if there are pitches being prepared and there is reward

03:01:29.240 --> 03:01:35.720
[Guest]: for fast bowlers to put in that hard work and get into an IPL team, and each IPL team now has

03:01:35.720 --> 03:01:41.480
[Guest]: 16-17 Indian players. Next year, after the auction, there's going to be 10 teams,

03:01:41.480 --> 03:01:49.400
[Guest]: that many more players needed. And my surmise now is that for each place that an Indian player

03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:53.720
[Guest]: gets into in any of the IPL teams, there are five other competitors he has left behind.

03:01:55.240 --> 03:02:03.320
[Guest]: So, there are so many more who are part of the, you know, of the waiting to get a look-in.

03:02:03.320 --> 03:02:09.240
[Guest]: And then, there's a cascading effect, you know. So, I think that Indian cricket has become richer

03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:17.080
[Guest]: in the financial sense, of course, but also richer in its skills and in the opportunities

03:02:17.080 --> 03:02:23.000
[Guest]: it gives to the practitioners today, far better than ever before. And I think that's what is

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:26.360
[Guest]: helping Indian cricket. I mean, one of the unfortunate things which has happened is,

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:30.600
[Guest]: unfortunately, in the sense that we went, we couldn't win the World Test Championship,

03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:37.640
[Guest]: which, you know, one thought that they would, given all the skills, the players they had at

03:02:37.640 --> 03:02:42.440
[Guest]: their disposal. Of course, give credit to New Zealand for winning that. But that hurt, you know,

03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:47.560
[Guest]: in terms of… because winning that, you've been number one team for three and a half years,

03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:49.720
[Guest]: Test team. But in the final, you lose out.

03:02:50.680 --> 03:02:53.640
[Amit Varma]: I think that was finally determined by really one game.

03:02:53.640 --> 03:02:59.080
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah. No, I'm just saying. So, it's a sense of loss in terms of having, you know,

03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:02.920
[Guest]: having a cup in your… Again, if you look at the number of matches that India has won,

03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:05.080
[Guest]: it's far greater than all the other teams.

03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:09.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, you mentioned kind of fast bowlers and I'm reminded of an interesting incident that

03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:14.760
[Amit Varma]: happened where the night before a Test match began, you know, there were two debutant fast

03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:20.200
[Amit Varma]: bowlers in that Test and they were both Muslims. And I was chatting at a party along with a couple

03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:24.760
[Amit Varma]: of other journalists with the then chairman of selectors. I won't name him now. Great cricketer

03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:28.600
[Amit Varma]: in his own right. Before, he's an old man now. I don't want to get him into controversy.

03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:34.680
[Amit Varma]: But he was kind of tipsy. And he said that, you know, why I picked these two kids?

03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:40.120
[Amit Varma]: And we said, sir, why? And he said, you know, because if you think about fast bowling,

03:03:40.120 --> 03:03:43.720
[Amit Varma]: they eat meat. Meat and two Muslims. He said, you look at the Pathans,

03:03:43.720 --> 03:03:49.080
[Amit Varma]: why does Pakistan have so many good fast bowlers? Yeah, so that whole martial theory, you know,

03:03:49.080 --> 03:03:54.520
[Amit Varma]: martial as in M-A-R-T-I-A-L, that whole martial race theory, which actually for a long time

03:03:54.520 --> 03:03:57.880
[Amit Varma]: dictated the composition of the Pakistan Army. I don't know if it still does.

03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:01.800
[Amit Varma]: But the Indian Army stopped the practice of, you know, building units according to

03:04:01.800 --> 03:04:05.960
[Amit Varma]: which race you're from. And that that old fallacious notion that certain people can

03:04:05.960 --> 03:04:10.360
[Amit Varma]: fight, other people can't fight, you know, and that's obviously complete bunkum.

03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:14.120
[Amit Varma]: That brings the importance of the IPL here because it was a conventional notion that

03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Indians can't do fast bowling, you know. And yet here we are today where some of the best

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:24.120
[Amit Varma]: fast bowlers in the world are very much from India. And I think one of my pieces in your book

03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:28.920
[Amit Varma]: also is about this. And I remember even at the time before the IPL started, you know,

03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:33.400
[Amit Varma]: I wrote a piece about how it would sort of revolutionize Indian cricket because there

03:04:33.400 --> 03:04:38.680
[Amit Varma]: were so many naysayers that commercialization and tamasha and all of that. And it has exceeded

03:04:38.680 --> 03:04:44.360
[Amit Varma]: even my expectations in this sense that one before that cricket was a monopsony. You had

03:04:44.360 --> 03:04:50.120
[Amit Varma]: one buyer for your services that was a BCCI. Here, even if it's within an artificial environment,

03:04:50.120 --> 03:04:54.200
[Amit Varma]: you've broken the monopsony. You have a, you know, a number of different buyers who are

03:04:54.200 --> 03:04:59.560
[Amit Varma]: competing for the best talent, who are incentivized to invest in scouting and training and all of

03:04:59.560 --> 03:05:04.520
[Amit Varma]: those things. And the incentives for young cricketers no longer are that let me go abroad

03:05:04.520 --> 03:05:08.920
[Amit Varma]: to college because who knows whether I'll be the next Sachin Tendulkar. Here, you know,

03:05:08.920 --> 03:05:12.920
[Amit Varma]: so many people succeed so many different role models. And it's completely transformed the

03:05:12.920 --> 03:05:17.000
[Amit Varma]: game even in terms of skills. Like earlier, you mentioned that, you know, Virat Kohli's fitness,

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:22.120
[Amit Varma]: and I admire that greatly. Like if there is one thing that, you know, that where Virat Kohli is

03:05:22.120 --> 03:05:27.320
[Amit Varma]: unparalleled is in his work ethic. Yes. Remember, I remember seeing him when he was 19 years old,

03:05:27.320 --> 03:05:31.800
[Amit Varma]: and I thought ki nahi hai, nahi hai, this kid doesn't have it. He's, you know, predominantly

03:05:31.800 --> 03:05:36.520
[Amit Varma]: offside game and square of the wicket and all of that. And it just didn't seem to have it.

03:05:36.520 --> 03:05:41.080
[Amit Varma]: And to transform himself into what is unquestionably the world's best batsman for a

03:05:41.080 --> 03:05:45.640
[Amit Varma]: period of time. And the best ODI player ever is I think, just mind blowing. But I think that

03:05:45.640 --> 03:05:49.000
[Amit Varma]: the fitness standards of the Indian team are not because of that one guy, it's because of the

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:53.560
[Amit Varma]: incentives of the IPL, where every run matters so much more. And you see these crazy catches,

03:05:53.560 --> 03:05:59.480
[Amit Varma]: which would be outliers. You know, you occasionally see a Jonty Rhodes pull it off. But now...

03:05:59.480 --> 03:06:02.840
[Guest]: So I mean, the big shift has been that Indian cricketers have become athletes,

03:06:02.840 --> 03:06:08.120
[Guest]: the athletic, you know, earlier, they were never athletes. I mean, a bowler, a spin bowler,

03:06:08.120 --> 03:06:12.120
[Guest]: not a fast bowler in India would be a great fielder of his own bowling, but not otherwise.

03:06:12.120 --> 03:06:20.280
[Guest]: You know. And so, I think that we used to always marvel. I mean, when I… My first match,

03:06:20.280 --> 03:06:26.040
[Guest]: I remember, Brian Booth, 1964, which I watched live. Brian Booth, you know, his throws from

03:06:26.040 --> 03:06:31.240
[Guest]: the deep. I mean, we would… If the throw came straight to the wicket-keeper, the entire stadium

03:06:31.240 --> 03:06:37.800
[Guest]: would applaud. And if an Indian player threw it, my God, there would be like unstinted applause.

03:06:37.800 --> 03:06:43.640
[Guest]: Because, you know, the arms were weak. The speed was not as good. Tiger Pathaudi was called Tiger

03:06:43.640 --> 03:06:51.800
[Guest]: because he was so fleet-footed. So, any… Those were exceptions. Now today, if you don't… The

03:06:51.800 --> 03:06:55.800
[Guest]: poor fielder is the exception. Not the good fielder. The standards have gone up so high.

03:06:55.800 --> 03:06:59.240
[Amit Varma]: The poor fielder is not even the exception because you'll never see him. He won't be in the team.

03:06:59.240 --> 03:07:04.280
[Guest]: Exactly. And especially in white-ball cricket, so, there's no chance. There's no chance. So,

03:07:04.280 --> 03:07:08.280
[Guest]: I think that has been a big shift that… And it's all come down to

03:07:09.720 --> 03:07:14.520
[Guest]: reaching a certain value proposition for yourself. If you're a terrific batsman,

03:07:15.160 --> 03:07:20.840
[Guest]: and you're a poor fielder, you may still not get a value which you feel you deserve or actually

03:07:20.840 --> 03:07:26.040
[Guest]: which you should get. I'm talking of a value for an IPL team or, you know, one of those.

03:07:26.040 --> 03:07:29.320
[Guest]: If you're a terrific fast bowler, but you can't feel you're letting the ball go through between

03:07:29.320 --> 03:07:34.360
[Guest]: your legs and can't bend down, you might not be selected. You know, you might be skillful,

03:07:34.360 --> 03:07:38.840
[Guest]: but you might not be selected. And if you are selected, you might still not get optimum value

03:07:38.840 --> 03:07:44.600
[Guest]: for what you could have got otherwise. So, that has also started, you know, kind of playing on

03:07:44.600 --> 03:07:50.040
[Guest]: the minds of people. And let's also factor in one thing which has not yet happened. It could happen

03:07:50.040 --> 03:07:56.520
[Guest]: in the future. The Indian cricket establishment does not allow its cricketers to play overseas

03:07:56.520 --> 03:08:03.320
[Guest]: in other leagues while it invites all other cricketers, right? There's a ban, especially

03:08:03.320 --> 03:08:07.240
[Guest]: for those who are eligible. I mean, you can have a retired cricketer going and playing some T10 or

03:08:07.240 --> 03:08:14.040
[Guest]: something, that's fine. But if they… somebody goes and appeals that… Restraint of trade.

03:08:14.040 --> 03:08:19.000
[Guest]: Restraint of trade, it could happen that they'll be allowed… Then you'll find that more cricketers

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:23.880
[Guest]: are in demand, you know, and they can go and play here, there, anywhere. Those who don't get into

03:08:23.880 --> 03:08:29.320
[Guest]: the IPL teams and are not part of the Indian team, what do they do for those 2-3 months?

03:08:29.960 --> 03:08:36.120
[Guest]: They might want livelihood. So, that is still not being permitted. So, that could change in

03:08:36.120 --> 03:08:41.080
[Guest]: the future. So, more demand will be there for, you know, more cricketers. So, I mean,

03:08:41.080 --> 03:08:44.760
[Guest]: it might affect international cricket and the itinerary of how cricket is played. That's a

03:08:44.760 --> 03:08:48.840
[Guest]: different matter. But I'm just saying that the whole shift has happened because there are more

03:08:48.840 --> 03:08:56.280
[Guest]: opportunities. Careers could be short-lived, you know. There'll be more dead bodies on the

03:08:56.280 --> 03:09:01.480
[Guest]: floor because other younger players have come in and they've replaced those who are not delivering.

03:09:01.480 --> 03:09:06.600
[Amit Varma]: Or they could be longer-lived because people who are there are just much fitter than an

03:09:06.600 --> 03:09:11.320
[Guest]: earlier generation was. Yeah. But I'm saying that you will need to keep performing all the time,

03:09:11.320 --> 03:09:16.600
[Guest]: you know. You know, you could get a two-year period where a guy is not doing well and say,

03:09:16.600 --> 03:09:22.120
[Guest]: no, he has a lot of class. That may not happen now. You know, it's not easy to happen now.

03:09:22.120 --> 03:09:26.760
[Guest]: There'll be questions asked immediately because somebody else has come in making a flurry of runs

03:09:27.560 --> 03:09:31.720
[Guest]: or taking wickets. And you say, hey, you know. And it's become competitive. People are more

03:09:31.720 --> 03:09:35.560
[Guest]: results-driven. There are more results happening in matches. Matches are producing more…

03:09:35.560 --> 03:09:42.360
[Amit Varma]: Even test matches, 75-77% results. I believe that the standard of cricket overall, not just T20,

03:09:42.360 --> 03:09:48.280
[Amit Varma]: has just gone up over the last 15 years. And I think T20 is the reason because contrary to what

03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:52.360
[Amit Varma]: people said back in the day that, oh, it'll just be a slugfest, bowlers will suffer.

03:09:52.360 --> 03:09:57.240
[Amit Varma]: I think batsmen have had to lift their skills because, hey, less balls to play with. And

03:09:57.240 --> 03:10:00.840
[Amit Varma]: therefore, you can't waste any balls. So your attacking skills have gone through the roof.

03:10:00.840 --> 03:10:04.920
[Amit Varma]: And bowlers, their skills have gone through the roof because bowlers still decide matches,

03:10:04.920 --> 03:10:07.080
[Guest]: no matter what form of the game that you play. Of course.

03:10:07.080 --> 03:10:11.160
[Amit Varma]: And it's not just India's fast bowlers, but the development of great spinners

03:10:11.160 --> 03:10:14.200
[Amit Varma]: and what they bring to the table, I think, is also off the charts. And you

03:10:14.200 --> 03:10:19.000
[Amit Varma]: see that in test cricket as well. I, you know, did an episode with Gideon Hay and Prem Panikkar.

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:23.720
[Amit Varma]: And Gideon made a fascinating observation about the ODI World Cup before the last one,

03:10:23.720 --> 03:10:26.200
[Unknown]: where he said that if you watched that ODI World Cup…

03:10:26.200 --> 03:10:26.920
[Guest]: 2015.

03:10:26.920 --> 03:10:30.920
[Amit Varma]: 2015 World Cup, where he said, if you watched that World Cup, the good teams,

03:10:30.920 --> 03:10:35.240
[Amit Varma]: they are batting like it's a T20 and bowling like it's a test match.

03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:40.040
[Guest]: Absolutely. It's a fantastic observation. He's absolutely right. So what has happened?

03:10:40.040 --> 03:10:44.040
[Guest]: So what has happened is, it's compelled every cricketer now, who wants to reach anywhere,

03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:50.040
[Guest]: or even get into the higher or upper echelons of domestic cricket, you have to be far more

03:10:50.040 --> 03:10:54.840
[Guest]: skillful. You have to be far more inventive. You have to improvise a lot more. I mean,

03:10:55.640 --> 03:11:01.960
[Guest]: we never heard of carrom ball, you know, spin or cross seam bowling. I mean, it may have been there.

03:11:01.960 --> 03:11:05.720
[Guest]: But otherwise, you look at any coaching manual of the past, they would tell the fast bowlers

03:11:05.720 --> 03:11:09.880
[Guest]: to grip the seam in a certain way, which was an upright seam and move your fingers around

03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:15.160
[Guest]: for in-swing or out-swing. But now, fast bowlers are trying everything. They are trying a knuckleball

03:11:15.160 --> 03:11:21.320
[Guest]: also. They are bowling at 110. Fast bowlers earlier bowled fast, you know. And Gavaskar made a comment,

03:11:21.320 --> 03:11:28.200
[Guest]: very interesting one. He says, in my days, fast bowlers bowled fast, very fast or very, very fast.

03:11:29.160 --> 03:11:35.080
[Guest]: You know, that was the kind of bowling we faced. But now, even in test cricket,

03:11:35.080 --> 03:11:40.760
[Guest]: with so much protective gear available, yes, we've had an unfortunate incident of Phil Yu's,

03:11:40.760 --> 03:11:46.600
[Guest]: you know, getting hit and losing his life, which is very unfortunate. But there's one of the reasons,

03:11:46.600 --> 03:11:51.960
[Guest]: you know, people like us, journalists and experts end up being very critical that,

03:11:51.960 --> 03:11:55.800
[Guest]: hey, batsman is playing recklessly. But actually, what has happened is, psychologically,

03:11:55.800 --> 03:12:01.080
[Guest]: with so much protective gear, he's willing to take that risk because the threat of getting hit has reduced.

03:12:01.080 --> 03:12:08.760
[Guest]: Yeah. So, earlier, he was curbing himself from a natural shot that he had in his armory

03:12:09.400 --> 03:12:15.160
[Guest]: to score runs for… apart from the fact that he might lose his wicket, but he was prepared to take

03:12:15.160 --> 03:12:20.200
[Guest]: the risk. But what if I miss? I'll get hit on the head or the body or something and I might lose out

03:12:20.200 --> 03:12:26.840
[Guest]: on the next match. And that prevented or stopped them from taking the risk. Today, those risks are

03:12:26.840 --> 03:12:33.320
[Guest]: being taken by almost every team, except in dire situations, dire crisis, when you have to bat out

03:12:33.960 --> 03:12:38.920
[Guest]: periods of play in a test match or save a test match. And therefore, the commentary is always,

03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:45.560
[Guest]: he's playing real cricket or old-fashioned cricket and all, which is such humbug, you know.

03:12:45.560 --> 03:12:50.200
[Amit Varma]: Which is humbug because you do whatever has a maximum expected value in a situation.

03:12:50.200 --> 03:12:50.600
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

03:12:50.600 --> 03:12:55.320
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes, you know, I remember a test match where AB de Villiers and I think Faf du Plessis

03:12:55.320 --> 03:13:00.280
[Amit Varma]: just, you know, played at this… or Hashim Amla, I think, for a while, batted at this extremely

03:13:00.280 --> 03:13:05.560
[Amit Varma]: slow strike rate of 20 because they needed to save a match. And you will have similar situations

03:13:05.560 --> 03:13:10.200
[Amit Varma]: where batsmen are just going for it, not because they are reckless, but because the expected value

03:13:10.200 --> 03:13:14.600
[Amit Varma]: of aggression is so much more. And everything is, you know, the situation in that sense.

03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:18.120
[Guest]: And look at what's happened. I mean, the Australians brought about a shift there.

03:13:18.120 --> 03:13:24.200
[Guest]: The West Indians, in many ways, the great West Indies team, there was a bit of a negative way

03:13:24.200 --> 03:13:28.280
[Guest]: in which they played. Not the way they played, but the fast bowlers, they would bowl 65, 70

03:13:28.280 --> 03:13:32.760
[Guest]: overs in a day because, you know, then they had to bring in the 90-over thing. The Australians,

03:13:32.760 --> 03:13:39.240
[Guest]: when they became a great team, post-Border, they started scoring at 330, 340, 350 runs a day.

03:13:39.960 --> 03:13:43.400
[Guest]: You set up the match on day one, you know, if you are batting first.

03:13:44.840 --> 03:13:49.320
[Guest]: You got Adam Gilchrist coming at number six or seven who puts you the next day into a position

03:13:49.320 --> 03:13:53.400
[Guest]: from which you can't lose. So, they kept winning match after match and series after series.

03:13:53.400 --> 03:13:59.240
[Guest]: And just changed the, you know, the way Test cricket would be played and became so much more

03:13:59.240 --> 03:14:07.000
[Guest]: enjoyable. Now, a lot of teams, I mean, if you score at less than 2.8 or 2.75, you're actually

03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:10.680
[Amit Varma]: not playing well. You might end up losing the match. Yeah. The more balls you face, the more

03:14:10.680 --> 03:14:15.080
[Amit Varma]: likely it is that you're going to lose your wicket at some point. Very difficult. Like it can happen

03:14:15.080 --> 03:14:20.520
[Guest]: in England or, you know, suddenly you had a collapse. So, then you have to see out a session

03:14:20.520 --> 03:14:26.120
[Guest]: that's different. But by and large, the thinking today is that at least three runs in over, you

03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:33.320
[Guest]: know, 90 overs, 2.75, 2.80, 300 in a day is what is needed for me to set up the match in an attempt

03:14:33.320 --> 03:14:38.280
[Amit Varma]: to win it. What's also happened is that the orthodoxy is being redefined. Like I remember

03:14:38.280 --> 03:14:43.880
[Amit Varma]: watching the Under-19 World Cup two World Cups ago when India lost in the final to West Indies.

03:14:43.880 --> 03:14:48.760
[Amit Varma]: I think it must have been 2017 when Rishabh Pant was in the side opening with Ishaan Kishan and

03:14:48.760 --> 03:14:53.480
[Amit Varma]: Armaan Jaffer, Sarfaraz Khan, all those guys were there. And I remember watching Armaan Jaffer

03:14:53.480 --> 03:14:58.280
[Amit Varma]: play these beautiful innings where it struck me that he was playing incredibly unorthodox strokes

03:14:58.280 --> 03:15:03.480
[Amit Varma]: like reverse sweeps or whatever and making them look like they're out of the textbook. Like it

03:15:03.480 --> 03:15:09.320
[Amit Varma]: was so natural and reflexive to him. He's not trying something special. It's part of his armory

03:15:09.320 --> 03:15:14.280
[Amit Varma]: baked into his reflexes because he's practiced it from when he was 12 and not, you know,

03:15:14.280 --> 03:15:19.720
[Guest]: learnt it as an adult for a particular situation. Coaching methods have also changed. I mean,

03:15:19.720 --> 03:15:25.000
[Guest]: Gavaskar, by his coach, would have been told never to hit the ball in the air. Today's coaches,

03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:28.520
[Guest]: if they tell a youngster don't hit the ball in the air, he'll change the coach because he's

03:15:28.520 --> 03:15:32.920
[Guest]: watching IPL and ODIs and saying, if I don't hit the ball in the air, where will I score runs from?

03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:39.480
[Guest]: You know, so you have to learn to improvise and make that adjustment within your own game,

03:15:39.480 --> 03:15:44.440
[Guest]: you know, and it's become mandatory. You cannot not do it. That's become the big change.

03:15:44.440 --> 03:15:47.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, if you hit only in the V, they'll put fielders in the V and then you're done,

03:15:47.800 --> 03:15:52.200
[Amit Varma]: you're finished. You're gone. You're gone. So you mentioned an interesting thing a while ago,

03:15:52.200 --> 03:15:56.520
[Amit Varma]: which, you know, gives me a segue to my next question where you spoke about how if Indians

03:15:56.520 --> 03:15:59.960
[Amit Varma]: are allowed to play overseas leagues, they'll have more leagues and that might affect international

03:15:59.960 --> 03:16:04.120
[Amit Varma]: cricket. And there's a part of me which is thinking that maybe that's a good thing.

03:16:04.120 --> 03:16:10.840
[Amit Varma]: And the reason I say that is that when cricket is between nations, it's bound up with a lot of

03:16:10.840 --> 03:16:16.840
[Amit Varma]: tribalism. It can often seem like what Orville called war minus the shooting. And I understand

03:16:16.840 --> 03:16:23.080
[Amit Varma]: that tribalism to a certain extent is, you know, baked into every sport, you have your team. And

03:16:23.080 --> 03:16:27.080
[Amit Varma]: even if it's a club, you know, you could form a tribe around it, though I haven't really seen

03:16:27.080 --> 03:16:31.480
[Amit Varma]: hardcore Mumbai Indian tribes or whatever, you will support a team, but it won't be a matter

03:16:31.480 --> 03:16:35.640
[Amit Varma]: of life and death, you won't kill someone for it, while at the level of countries is different.

03:16:35.640 --> 03:16:40.440
[Amit Varma]: And I'm wondering how you see that evolving over a period of time, because I think it's a healthy

03:16:40.440 --> 03:16:44.680
[Amit Varma]: shift, all these international cricketers playing together, at least those older tribes not

03:16:44.680 --> 03:16:49.160
[Amit Varma]: mattering so much. And you know, when you look at the journey of Indian cricket, you know, we used

03:16:49.160 --> 03:16:53.400
[Amit Varma]: to have the quadrangular and the pentangular, which was played on a basis of Hindus versus

03:16:53.400 --> 03:16:58.280
[Amit Varma]: Muslims versus Europeans versus whatever, which was actually explicitly tribal.

03:16:58.280 --> 03:17:03.640
[Amit Varma]: Parsis also. Parsis also and Mahatma Gandhi hated cricket for this reason, apparently.

03:17:03.640 --> 03:17:11.320
[Amit Varma]: It's a good reason, but it's also a great sport. And so how have you sort of seen this changing

03:17:11.320 --> 03:17:17.720
[Amit Varma]: over all these years, in the sense that I would imagine that cricketers except those handful of

03:17:17.720 --> 03:17:21.880
[Amit Varma]: elites who were lucky enough to say play county cricket in England or whatever, would be living

03:17:21.880 --> 03:17:26.360
[Amit Varma]: in an insular world, where they are meeting only their own types, only their own tribes, like when

03:17:26.360 --> 03:17:31.160
[Amit Varma]: you when you watch the ugliness of some India-Pakistan matches of the past, especially when

03:17:31.160 --> 03:17:34.360
[Amit Varma]: the media builds it up and the media is only building it up because they think there's an

03:17:34.360 --> 03:17:41.560
[Amit Varma]: audience for it and it plays. Is that a disturbing aspect of sport that is always an undercurrent

03:17:41.560 --> 03:17:46.120
[Amit Varma]: when sport is being played? And are we living in times where maybe it doesn't matter so much? Maybe

03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:52.760
[Amit Varma]: that's another really bright aspect of franchise cricket, that we can see, you know, an Australian

03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:57.320
[Amit Varma]: and Indian and Englishman and hopefully one day, inshallah, Pakistanis as well, in the same

03:17:57.320 --> 03:18:03.480
[Guest]: dressing room, being a team together? Yeah, so I mean, it's a complex, you know, question and

03:18:03.480 --> 03:18:08.600
[Guest]: situation and there are myriad possibilities. For instance, India-Pakistan, it's a very unusual

03:18:09.160 --> 03:18:14.200
[Guest]: and offbeat coexistence as two cricketing nations. So we've had a series in the 50s,

03:18:14.200 --> 03:18:19.560
[Guest]: a couple of series in the 50s, one in India, one in Pakistan, then one more in India in 62,

03:18:19.560 --> 03:18:25.880
[Guest]: 61, 62, and then nothing for 17 years, till 78, because you've had two wars, 65 and 71, being

03:18:25.880 --> 03:18:31.640
[Guest]: fought. And then cricket is seen as a, let's bring the countries together closer. And

03:18:31.640 --> 03:18:36.760
[Guest]: interestingly, it's by, not by the Congress or whatever, it's the, at that point in time,

03:18:36.760 --> 03:18:41.320
[Guest]: the Janata government, you know, which has Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who's the foreign minister,

03:18:41.320 --> 03:18:48.040
[Guest]: who initiates this. And then we have Kargil, I mean, then we have 87, where there's eyeball

03:18:48.040 --> 03:18:53.800
[Guest]: to eyeball confrontation on the border. And then we've got Zia-ul-Haq coming to India and,

03:18:53.800 --> 03:19:00.760
[Guest]: you know, tensions getting deflated. And the test series brings things to normal. And then

03:19:00.760 --> 03:19:09.240
[Guest]: it goes bad again, Kargil. And then, again, it's a BJP-led government, NDA government,

03:19:09.240 --> 03:19:13.800
[Guest]: with Vajpayee as the prime minister and LK Erwani as the home minister, which allows the

03:19:13.800 --> 03:19:18.120
[Guest]: Indian team, where you went to Pakistan in 2004 and 5, maybe even later.

03:19:18.120 --> 03:19:20.120
[Guest]: I went in 2006, the one after that.

03:19:20.120 --> 03:19:21.960
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah. But in 2004 and 5, and

03:19:21.960 --> 03:19:22.520
[Amit Varma]: Great tour, yeah.

03:19:22.520 --> 03:19:27.720
[Guest]: It was a great tour. And, you know, it didn't seem possible, but it happened. And then after

03:19:27.720 --> 03:19:35.400
[Guest]: that, we've had no, you know, 2006, we've had no tour of Pakistan. So, it's been like hot and cold.

03:19:35.400 --> 03:19:43.160
[Guest]: So, it, you know, the tribalism in this whole, and then the role of the media and the way passions

03:19:43.160 --> 03:19:49.000
[Guest]: are stoked and reach boiling point is always a threat, you know, and it's not something which is

03:19:49.560 --> 03:19:55.560
[Guest]: easily palatable, at least to me, or digestible, because I think, you know, maybe a romantic

03:19:55.560 --> 03:20:02.520
[Guest]: notion, but there should be a slightly more loftier reason to play sport, not one-upmanship of this

03:20:02.520 --> 03:20:09.720
[Guest]: kind. But so, it works, and sometimes it doesn't work. I am a proponent that sport should be

03:20:09.720 --> 03:20:15.160
[Guest]: allowed, you know, between the two countries to try and reach an approachment or a level of

03:20:15.160 --> 03:20:19.240
[Guest]: interaction, which is very important, especially when you're neighbours. So, when body line happens

03:20:19.240 --> 03:20:24.600
[Guest]: and England and Australia almost come to war, in a sense, that is more symbolic war than real war,

03:20:24.600 --> 03:20:32.440
[Guest]: because they're separated by, you know, several continents. Though the rivalry has become now,

03:20:32.440 --> 03:20:38.120
[Guest]: you know, part of such great tradition and legacy, that it's played very intensely, but it's never a

03:20:38.120 --> 03:20:42.920
[Guest]: war-like situation like there is between India and Pakistan. Whether bilateral matches themselves,

03:20:42.920 --> 03:20:48.280
[Guest]: bilateral cricket is losing currency, it's a bit of a yes and no. So, what has happened,

03:20:48.280 --> 03:20:55.240
[Guest]: certainly in cricket, and especially test cricket, is that, frankly, there are only three countries

03:20:55.240 --> 03:21:03.160
[Guest]: that play test cricket to an audience which makes it worthwhile, which is India, England and

03:21:03.160 --> 03:21:08.040
[Guest]: Australia. And these are the three, that's why the big three, and there was this, you know, conflict

03:21:08.040 --> 03:21:14.280
[Guest]: within the ICC, because the audiences in the other countries have changed dramatically. Pakistan has

03:21:14.280 --> 03:21:20.760
[Guest]: been very iffy ever since the terror attack on the Sri Lankans 2009. I don't even know if they've got

03:21:20.760 --> 03:21:26.200
[Guest]: a very committed audience for test cricket. So too in the West Indies, so too in New Zealand.

03:21:26.920 --> 03:21:31.880
[Guest]: So, ultimately, if test cricket is surviving today, it's because of these three countries.

03:21:31.880 --> 03:21:38.120
[Guest]: And is that too many or too few to sustain the sport? You know, the money is huge,

03:21:38.120 --> 03:21:41.800
[Guest]: because India is a huge country, the number of eyeballs is still phenomenal between India,

03:21:41.800 --> 03:21:47.240
[Guest]: Australia and England. But the footprint of the game is not expanding where the longest

03:21:47.240 --> 03:21:54.040
[Guest]: format is concerned. And therefore, T20 seems like the more viable option, including getting

03:21:54.040 --> 03:21:59.400
[Guest]: into the Olympics, which has been a long-stated desire of many players, though, of course, the

03:21:59.400 --> 03:22:06.280
[Guest]: ICC and BCCI also didn't want, you know, they lose control, at least for a mega tournament.

03:22:06.280 --> 03:22:12.360
[Guest]: And then it affects in many ways, you know. So, I mean, this whole thing about the BCCI,

03:22:12.360 --> 03:22:19.000
[Guest]: I personally feel that BCCI, given its current position, should be in the vanguard of protecting

03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:27.240
[Guest]: and promoting cricket in all its formats. But they're never the leaders, you know. So, 2007,

03:22:27.240 --> 03:22:33.480
[Guest]: for instance, when T20 World Cup was being mooted in 2005-06 and it happened in 2007,

03:22:33.480 --> 03:22:38.520
[Guest]: India was the last country to agree to play. And therefore, you found that the big players didn't

03:22:38.520 --> 03:22:47.720
[Guest]: go. As it happened, Dhoni led his team to victory and rewrote, you know, the future of cricket was

03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:52.200
[Guest]: rewritten after that, because we won the T20 World Cup and then the IPL happened and then

03:22:52.200 --> 03:22:57.880
[Guest]: whatever. But India, BCCI did not want to play that. They reluctantly agreed.

03:22:57.880 --> 03:23:06.600
[Guest]: So, I was at a… I moderated a session once in 2010, just a year before Tiger Pathodi passed

03:23:06.600 --> 03:23:10.280
[Guest]: away, where he was… It was called the Raj Singh Dungarpur Memorial Lecture. Raj Singh had passed

03:23:10.280 --> 03:23:15.960
[Guest]: away by then. So, he ends with this thought and he had been part of the IPL Governing Council,

03:23:15.960 --> 03:23:24.440
[Guest]: former India captain. He says, BCCI… The problem is that the ICC is the voice of cricket or

03:23:24.440 --> 03:23:28.200
[Guest]: needs to be the voice of cricket. BCCI is happy being the invoice of cricket.

03:23:28.200 --> 03:23:29.080
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:23:29.080 --> 03:23:35.080
[Guest]: You know. And it was a very pungent, very telling comment. So, I think BCCI now that it's got,

03:23:35.720 --> 03:23:42.120
[Guest]: you know, money is not the issue. You got the hottest property, the IPL. You know,

03:23:42.120 --> 03:23:48.440
[Guest]: you got a committed following and runs into millions and millions of people. How do you

03:23:48.440 --> 03:23:54.040
[Guest]: take the sport to the next level is really the challenge. And I'm not seeing any great

03:23:54.040 --> 03:23:56.040
[Guest]: vision that is emerging.

03:23:56.600 --> 03:24:00.520
[Amit Varma]: I have great apprehensions about the BCCI's current leadership. But all said and done,

03:24:00.520 --> 03:24:05.240
[Amit Varma]: I think in the last decade, barring one area, they've done a pretty good job. That one area is,

03:24:05.240 --> 03:24:09.080
[Amit Varma]: of course, one would have liked them to promote women's cricket much more strongly because I

03:24:09.080 --> 03:24:12.920
[Amit Varma]: think there's great potential for building an audience there. You know…

03:24:12.920 --> 03:24:15.000
[Guest]: BCCI has done wonderfully for itself.

03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:15.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:24:15.240 --> 03:24:19.960
[Guest]: You know, for Indian cricket, it's been fantastic. The last decade and more, maybe two decades.

03:24:19.960 --> 03:24:20.360
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:24:20.360 --> 03:24:25.400
[Guest]: You know, they've done, apart from the shenanigans within the BCCI, you know,

03:24:25.400 --> 03:24:30.760
[Guest]: within the board itself, that apart. But for the sport, they've done a lot. Old cricketers have

03:24:30.760 --> 03:24:37.080
[Guest]: been rewarded, huge amounts of money given as bonuses or ex gratia payment, you know,

03:24:37.080 --> 03:24:43.160
[Guest]: for illness, ailment. Money for players current, including right up to the junior level,

03:24:43.160 --> 03:24:46.360
[Guest]: they're getting a lot of money to support themselves.

03:24:46.360 --> 03:24:47.560
[Amit Varma]: And also the pipeline.

03:24:47.560 --> 03:24:47.640
[Guest]: Pipeline.

03:24:47.640 --> 03:24:51.800
[Guest]: Junior, India A, that's one reason, along with the IPL, why it's so deep.

03:24:51.800 --> 03:24:56.360
[Guest]: India A tours have been fantastic, you know. And they've got some, the right people. I mean,

03:24:56.360 --> 03:25:01.880
[Guest]: Rahul Rawat heading National Cricket Academy, India A coach, Under-19 coach. You can't ask

03:25:01.880 --> 03:25:05.960
[Guest]: for a better deal, better situation, you know. So, I think in many ways, they've done that.

03:25:05.960 --> 03:25:10.440
[Guest]: But I'm saying for the vision of the sport, they could do more.

03:25:11.480 --> 03:25:16.040
[Amit Varma]: Right. So, you know, we've spent a lot of time, but there's no way I'm ending this episode

03:25:16.040 --> 03:25:20.200
[Amit Varma]: without talking about many of the colourful characters of Indian cricket, you know,

03:25:20.200 --> 03:25:23.880
[Amit Varma]: many of whom have chapters in your book dedicated to them, written by some really

03:25:23.880 --> 03:25:30.840
[Amit Varma]: fine writers. I want to talk about one specific question, which is about how a player can

03:25:30.840 --> 03:25:35.240
[Amit Varma]: sometimes in a different way, seem to become almost a template. Like if we start with Vijay

03:25:35.240 --> 03:25:39.400
[Amit Varma]: Merchant, for example, right, the whole Bombay school of batting is from there, that whole

03:25:39.400 --> 03:25:43.640
[Amit Varma]: Kharoos attitude that kind of comes from there. And he first becomes an icon and then becomes

03:25:43.640 --> 03:25:48.760
[Amit Varma]: a template. And then, you know, you kind of wonder that sometimes does chasing an ideal

03:25:48.760 --> 03:25:53.720
[Amit Varma]: become a constraint in itself that you only bat that way. And one kind of understands why

03:25:53.720 --> 03:25:58.520
[Amit Varma]: that Kharoos kind of batting comes about and leads to, you know, Gavaskar and then in a

03:25:58.520 --> 03:26:03.000
[Amit Varma]: more refined form, Tendulkar, because right up to Gavaskar, you're playing to the imperatives

03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:07.480
[Amit Varma]: of the time where the team is pretty much bound to lose, where your job is not to go

03:26:07.480 --> 03:26:11.240
[Amit Varma]: out there and be super aggressive, but just hang in there as long as you can and save

03:26:11.240 --> 03:26:17.800
[Amit Varma]: some face and all of that. And it's also possible to then look at a number of individuals

03:26:17.800 --> 03:26:22.600
[Amit Varma]: like a Merchant and a Gavaskar and say that and build a narrative, which is not necessarily

03:26:22.600 --> 03:26:27.640
[Amit Varma]: true. You know, I mean, Sandeep Patil is also from Bombay and not at all in that mould.

03:26:27.640 --> 03:26:31.560
[Amit Varma]: So what are your kind of thoughts on it? Like, I think some of this could be laziness on

03:26:31.560 --> 03:26:36.520
[Amit Varma]: the part of cricket writers that we look at, say, a Hyderabadi wristy batsman and talk

03:26:36.520 --> 03:26:41.080
[Amit Varma]: about the lazy elegance and compare Azharuddin to Jai Simha and, you know, that kind of thing.

03:26:41.080 --> 03:26:46.920
[Amit Varma]: Is it dangerous to sort of think like that? Or did Merchant really have that kind of a

03:26:46.920 --> 03:26:52.120
[Amit Varma]: incredible impact that shaped an entire sort of school of batting as it's often called?

03:26:52.120 --> 03:26:56.360
[Guest]: I think it happens, you know, I mean, there can be players who can shape a whole school,

03:26:56.360 --> 03:27:02.760
[Guest]: you know, so the more wristy kind of batting skills come from the South more because people

03:27:02.760 --> 03:27:08.200
[Guest]: talk about it. And imagine if you're a youngster, if you're an Azharuddin who's growing up,

03:27:08.200 --> 03:27:13.560
[Guest]: playing for school, watching Vishi or watching Jai Simha or Abbas Ali Beg or one of these,

03:27:13.560 --> 03:27:15.320
[Guest]: you know, and the coaches are telling you,

03:27:15.320 --> 03:27:18.920
[Guest]: Abhi aayega na, aisa ball aayega off stump ke baar, usko Jai Simha ki tarah khilna.

03:27:19.560 --> 03:27:24.280
[Guest]: You know, so that stays in your mind. And then you say, okay, how is, you know,

03:27:24.280 --> 03:27:29.000
[Guest]: how does Jai Simha play or, you know, Abbas play or Vishi play? So you learn the more

03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:34.680
[Guest]: wristy kind of stroke play that is a hallmark of people from Lakshman now.

03:27:35.720 --> 03:27:37.960
[Guest]: In Mumbai's case, you know, the first original

03:27:39.240 --> 03:27:45.240
[Guest]: hero, iconic figure of Indian cricket is Colonel CK Naidu. And then Mohammed Nisar and Amar Singh,

03:27:45.240 --> 03:27:48.280
[Guest]: these are the fast bowlers, not too many batsmen you talk about.

03:27:48.280 --> 03:27:54.200
[Guest]: Then Lala Mannath comes and makes a hundred from the north. But in 1946,

03:27:54.200 --> 03:27:59.640
[Guest]: when India go to England and, you know, merchants cause more than 2000 runs in a wet English summer,

03:28:00.920 --> 03:28:07.400
[Guest]: and he's hailed as somebody who's got the technique, which is what English cricket thrived on,

03:28:07.400 --> 03:28:13.320
[Guest]: you know, and the mastery of English conditions was paramount where the English writers were concerned

03:28:13.320 --> 03:28:19.800
[Guest]: or English cricket thought leaders. And remember, a lot of literature that we got in our early years

03:28:19.800 --> 03:28:24.520
[Guest]: was from England. England has been profuse in cricket writing. Not so much Australia,

03:28:24.520 --> 03:28:29.960
[Guest]: certainly not the West Indies, not Pakistan, perhaps India now in the last 20, 25, 30 years.

03:28:30.760 --> 03:28:36.760
[Guest]: So what the English people thought became a paragon of virtue, cricketing virtue.

03:28:36.760 --> 03:28:41.720
[Guest]: And then he was immensely successful in Mumbai. He had the advantages of

03:28:41.720 --> 03:28:47.480
[Guest]: having his own personal coach because he was a well-to-do man, he was from a business family and

03:28:47.480 --> 03:28:51.000
[Guest]: etc. etc. But he became a role model for the way he played. I remember once speaking to,

03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:54.920
[Guest]: I met Vijay Merchant a couple of times in his second innings, as he used to call it,

03:28:54.920 --> 03:29:00.840
[Guest]: when he was associated with the blind. Madhav Mantri was a great admirer of

03:29:02.280 --> 03:29:06.120
[Guest]: Vijay Merchant. I asked him once, I said, what did you like about Vijay Merchant?

03:29:06.120 --> 03:29:13.000
[Guest]: He said, everything. His judgement of length, line, how to leave the ball,

03:29:13.880 --> 03:29:20.680
[Guest]: how to minimise risk and therefore, by implication, optimise opportunities if there was no risk.

03:29:20.680 --> 03:29:25.880
[Guest]: And he would go gaga over his late cut. He said, nobody played that late cut like that.

03:29:26.520 --> 03:29:30.120
[Guest]: Now imagine Madhav Mantri is Sunil Gavaskar's uncle,

03:29:30.120 --> 03:29:35.880
[Guest]: uncle. Yeah. Mama's brother. And when young Gavaskar is growing up,

03:29:35.880 --> 03:29:39.240
[Guest]: his ears must have been filled with stories about Vijay Merchant and what

03:29:39.880 --> 03:29:44.440
[Guest]: batting meant by his mama. And this is what he did. This is what he did in England. This is how

03:29:44.440 --> 03:29:48.840
[Guest]: you should bat. This is what happens. In Mumbai, it rains so much. Kanga League, when you play,

03:29:48.840 --> 03:29:53.320
[Guest]: these are the pitches. You can't take these, this. You can take that. So, Gavaskar is already

03:29:53.320 --> 03:29:58.840
[Guest]: growing into that school. And when Gavaskar is growing into that school, all the people from

03:29:58.840 --> 03:30:04.760
[Guest]: Chickalwadi and Dadar and wherever else, a young Vengsarkar is growing up. He's also learning about

03:30:05.480 --> 03:30:09.640
[Guest]: from Vasu Paranjpe or whatever. You know, all that is fine. Don't throw a bat. Look at how

03:30:09.640 --> 03:30:13.560
[Guest]: Gavaskar bats. Look at how Merchant used to bat. So, the culture develops. Of course, there are

03:30:13.560 --> 03:30:19.000
[Guest]: people like Sandeep Patil. But Sandeep Patil's father himself was, you know, he used to hit over

03:30:19.000 --> 03:30:25.320
[Guest]: the treetop. He was that big, big hitter. So, in his house, he emulated his father.

03:30:25.320 --> 03:30:31.960
[Guest]: But the wider cultural thing was that Mumbai opportunities to bat are few. Therefore,

03:30:31.960 --> 03:30:37.000
[Guest]: very strong on batsmanship, not so much on bowling, Mumbai cricket. You waste that opportunity,

03:30:37.000 --> 03:30:42.280
[Guest]: you take the long journey home by train, carrying your kid bag. And your next match, your next,

03:30:42.280 --> 03:30:45.880
[Guest]: you know, your coach might not even send you to bat. If you bat at number three or four and you've

03:30:45.880 --> 03:30:51.560
[Guest]: thrown your wicket away, next match, you may be eight or nine. So, all of these kind of,

03:30:51.560 --> 03:30:58.200
[Guest]: you know, crystallize into a certain cultural template. But of course, it's not so rigid as

03:30:58.200 --> 03:31:04.360
[Guest]: to only this works and not that. When you see a Rohit Sharma bat today, he's got fantastic

03:31:04.360 --> 03:31:10.360
[Guest]: technique. You know, he's a typical true blue Mumbiker as one understands from the stereotype.

03:31:10.360 --> 03:31:16.440
[Guest]: But he's also a new age modern cricketer who can, you know, who will bat like a Viv Richards,

03:31:16.440 --> 03:31:22.680
[Guest]: the way he bats in white ball cricket, or even in test cricket. You know, he's got the big shots,

03:31:22.680 --> 03:31:29.000
[Guest]: he's got the temerity to take on spinners, fast bowlers. Tendulkar, of course, was the one who

03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:34.760
[Guest]: straddled both white ball cricket and test red ball cricket like none before him, or perhaps

03:31:34.760 --> 03:31:41.000
[Guest]: even after him. So, there has been a tradition which develops over a period of time. And then,

03:31:41.000 --> 03:31:45.640
[Guest]: of course, more embellishments are added to the tradition and changes are made

03:31:45.640 --> 03:31:48.360
[Guest]: as the ethos changes and the sport changes.

03:31:48.360 --> 03:31:51.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, it's fascinating. You mentioned about how, you know, if a kid goes out there,

03:31:51.400 --> 03:31:55.800
[Amit Varma]: he's got one chance, he may not get another chance if he wastes this one. So, what is your incentive?

03:31:55.800 --> 03:32:01.320
[Amit Varma]: Your incentive is to minimize risk. So, one can, you know, the whole school of thought can just

03:32:01.320 --> 03:32:05.480
[Amit Varma]: evolve from the incentives as well as the role models that you have. And I think you mentioned

03:32:05.480 --> 03:32:10.600
[Amit Varma]: somewhere that Sandeep Patil in his house had an actual aeroplane on his terrace and it served

03:32:10.600 --> 03:32:15.800
[Guest]: as a bar. See, Sandeep was a flamboyant, you know, flamboyant personality. Even now, he's a lovely

03:32:15.800 --> 03:32:20.920
[Guest]: guy to meet. He was the first cricketer I interviewed in 1980. He was selected for the

03:32:20.920 --> 03:32:26.760
[Guest]: tour of Australia for the magazine, Sportsweek magazine. So, you know, and I went and spent time

03:32:26.760 --> 03:32:32.600
[Guest]: with him. He showed me the plane. And the plane was a bar. You know, and he was 24 or something.

03:32:32.600 --> 03:32:37.800
[Guest]: I said, wow, what a guy. We are almost of the same age. I may be a few months older than him.

03:32:37.800 --> 03:32:45.000
[Guest]: But, and, you know, it was very fascinating. And then he went and got a smashing 100 at Adelaide

03:32:45.000 --> 03:32:50.040
[Guest]: after being hit on the head. So, he became an even more colorful character. He couldn't hold

03:32:50.040 --> 03:32:56.200
[Guest]: his place on the team. He had fitness issues. You know, in those days, you could have a throwing

03:32:56.200 --> 03:33:00.600
[Guest]: arm which didn't work and still be in the team, as he would tell you himself now, honestly,

03:33:00.600 --> 03:33:05.800
[Guest]: that he's saying, otherwise, I wouldn't be in the team. But yeah, so all kinds of people were

03:33:05.800 --> 03:33:11.560
[Guest]: make up a team, as we know. What's interesting to me, and from an Indian point of view is that

03:33:12.440 --> 03:33:16.120
[Guest]: the Indian cricket team or the dressing room is a microcosm of Indian life.

03:33:17.160 --> 03:33:22.360
[Guest]: So, there is a Bombay school of thought in the team. There is a South India thing,

03:33:22.360 --> 03:33:27.720
[Guest]: more and more North India than just Delhi. You know, and Tiger Pataudi mentioned this,

03:33:27.720 --> 03:33:33.400
[Guest]: and this is something which is reflected about the 60s, or when he took over in Tiger's Tale.

03:33:33.400 --> 03:33:36.760
[Guest]: He says, the biggest challenge I had was these guys were all speaking in their own

03:33:36.760 --> 03:33:41.160
[Amit Varma]: different languages, you know. And this happened for a long time,

03:33:41.160 --> 03:33:46.120
[Amit Varma]: because even up to the 80s and the 90s, you know, like, first of all, you had a zonal selection

03:33:46.120 --> 03:33:49.480
[Amit Varma]: board. So, there were these quotas and... How absurd it seems now.

03:33:49.480 --> 03:33:53.640
[Amit Varma]: How absurd it seems now. And then you had, I mean, the classic illustration of this,

03:33:53.640 --> 03:33:58.600
[Amit Varma]: of course, is Kapil and Gavaskar, the rivalry between them. Though the interesting thing is

03:33:58.600 --> 03:34:03.400
[Amit Varma]: that they also had great regard for each other. Like, in fact, you know, Dikki Ratnagar writes

03:34:03.400 --> 03:34:09.160
[Amit Varma]: in your book on Kapil, that in that Melbourne test in 1981, when Kapil took 5 for 28 and we

03:34:09.160 --> 03:34:13.800
[Amit Varma]: won by 59 runs, when he was asked about what motivated him. Incidentally, a match in which

03:34:14.680 --> 03:34:21.640
[Guest]: Gavaskar almost cost us the match by staging a walkout. Yeah, yeah. When Lillie abused him.

03:34:21.640 --> 03:34:27.640
[Guest]: And he almost forced, of course, he regrets that action now. But then Kapil Dev came and...

03:34:27.640 --> 03:34:31.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And Kapil said, quote, I have to do it for Sunil, stop quote.

03:34:31.080 --> 03:34:31.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:34:31.480 --> 03:34:35.560
[Amit Varma]: And there's another incident where at Tunbridge Wells during that 175, you know,

03:34:35.560 --> 03:34:38.360
[Amit Varma]: when the innings is done, Sunny meets him halfway with a glass of water.

03:34:38.360 --> 03:34:38.600
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

03:34:38.600 --> 03:34:42.360
[Amit Varma]: Because he doesn't want him to wait to drink his water. So, there are these beautiful touching

03:34:42.360 --> 03:34:42.760
[Amit Varma]: moments.

03:34:42.760 --> 03:34:47.640
[Guest]: But it was a very strong, as what I remember, mutual admiration society. I know, I got to know

03:34:47.640 --> 03:34:52.680
[Guest]: both of them quite well. Sunil, in fact, also became the editor of Sportsweek magazine after

03:34:52.680 --> 03:34:58.280
[Guest]: he had quit. So, I worked and he would come with his handwritten editorial to start with

03:34:58.280 --> 03:35:04.600
[Guest]: and submit it. And, you know, he would come maybe once or twice a week, but always a little moody,

03:35:05.160 --> 03:35:12.760
[Guest]: but always full of great thoughts. If you could kind of incite him into talking about

03:35:13.640 --> 03:35:21.400
[Guest]: whatever, you know. Kapil, always warm, you know. Not very expressive in the sense that

03:35:21.400 --> 03:35:26.520
[Guest]: you want to elicit something from him, you know. The power of expression was obviously greater

03:35:26.520 --> 03:35:31.480
[Guest]: with Sunil. But Kapil was, in his own way, he would communicate. The funny thing about Kapil,

03:35:31.480 --> 03:35:37.880
[Guest]: as you know, which, you know, Shastri writes and he tells me also that you asked him any question,

03:35:37.880 --> 03:35:41.400
[Guest]: even in Hindi in a press conference, he would insist on talking in English.

03:35:41.400 --> 03:35:43.160
[Guest]: All his replies would be only in English.

03:35:44.360 --> 03:35:48.920
[Amit Varma]: There's a lovely anecdote in your book where I think in 78, 79, when he's, you know,

03:35:48.920 --> 03:35:53.400
[Amit Varma]: waiting for the team to Pakistan to be announced and he's being interviewed by Doordarshan,

03:35:53.400 --> 03:35:56.760
[Amit Varma]: by Rajsingh Dungarpur on the CCI lawns. And Dungarpur asks him,

03:35:56.760 --> 03:36:00.920
[Amit Varma]: congratulations Kapil, you must be looking forward to your first tour. And Kapil says, no.

03:36:01.560 --> 03:36:05.080
[Amit Varma]: And Rajsingh says, what, you aren't looking forward to the tour? And Kapil says, no,

03:36:05.080 --> 03:36:12.760
[Guest]: I don't want to look forward. He was captain in 1985-86 to Australia. There was a press conference

03:36:12.760 --> 03:36:19.640
[Guest]: at, I think, Ambassador Hotel on the terrace before the team's departure. So, Kapil, what do

03:36:19.640 --> 03:36:24.600
[Guest]: you want to, you know, what do you think about the tour? He says, I want to come back Victorian.

03:36:28.040 --> 03:36:29.880
[Amit Varma]: Very spontaneous, great fun, you know.

03:36:30.760 --> 03:36:36.200
[Amit Varma]: Which is completely the wrong description for him because he was anything but Victorian.

03:36:36.200 --> 03:36:39.560
[Amit Varma]: There's so many fascinating characters in Indian cricket. Just reading your book

03:36:39.560 --> 03:36:43.720
[Amit Varma]: again reminded me of that. Like, you know, the previous histories I've read like Nihir Bose's

03:36:43.720 --> 03:36:50.120
[Amit Varma]: history and Guha's history. It's just so filled with these colourful people. Veenu Mankad and

03:36:50.120 --> 03:36:55.400
[Amit Varma]: you've reproduced Rajan Bala's profile of him. Another person who is number one, not talked

03:36:55.400 --> 03:36:59.480
[Amit Varma]: about in the way that he would today. Like whenever I make my all-time Indian 11, I always

03:36:59.480 --> 03:37:04.200
[Amit Varma]: have Veenu Mankad at number six. Because, you know, great left arm bowler, great batsman. And

03:37:04.200 --> 03:37:09.160
[Amit Varma]: I remember as a young journalist, I looked up the stats as young journalists tend to do.

03:37:09.160 --> 03:37:13.240
[Amit Varma]: And I looked at Veenu Mankad's stats and Pauli Umbrigar's stats, his contemporary all-rounder.

03:37:13.240 --> 03:37:18.040
[Amit Varma]: And if you just look at the stats, you think that, oh, Umbrigar is far ahead. But then you go a

03:37:18.040 --> 03:37:22.200
[Amit Varma]: little deeper. And you realise that Mankad missed the best years of his career because of the war.

03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:28.920
[Amit Varma]: That, you know, if you look at the context of his victories, that India's first five test victories

03:37:28.920 --> 03:37:33.800
[Amit Varma]: had a big role played in them by Veenu Mankad. If you look at how good he was against fastballing,

03:37:33.800 --> 03:37:39.160
[Amit Varma]: while of Pauli Umbrigar, there are, you know, contrary stories told and you kind of realise that.

03:37:39.160 --> 03:37:42.360
[Amit Varma]: So it's very interesting that when you speak about the history of Indian cricket,

03:37:42.360 --> 03:37:45.800
[Amit Varma]: you're actually, in a sense, dividing it in two parts. One part is that part,

03:37:45.800 --> 03:37:50.200
[Amit Varma]: which people haven't seen on television. We are relying on stories. We are relying on

03:37:50.200 --> 03:37:53.880
[Amit Varma]: context. There's only so much you can make out from the scorecards, for example.

03:37:53.880 --> 03:37:58.440
[Amit Varma]: So these people aren't almost real people. They're like mythological figures.

03:37:58.440 --> 03:38:03.720
[Guest]: Absolutely, Amit. And I had, you know, I mean, one of my regrets is that I didn't get enough

03:38:03.720 --> 03:38:10.280
[Guest]: material of the 50s, you know, from 47 onwards. I didn't want to go beyond or pre-47. I wanted

03:38:10.280 --> 03:38:17.480
[Guest]: this to be a journey from 1947 and the decade of the 50s till Veenubhai Mankad retires.

03:38:17.480 --> 03:38:21.400
[Guest]: Look at his achievements. He's got 100 against John Batman's team, which went on to become the

03:38:21.400 --> 03:38:26.280
[Guest]: Invincibles in that series. The matches were lost, but he made 100. He's taken wickets against that

03:38:26.280 --> 03:38:31.880
[Guest]: great Australian team. He is the architect of India's first ever test victory against England

03:38:31.880 --> 03:38:39.080
[Guest]: at Madras. He is the architect of India's first victory over Pakistan, which is a great emotional

03:38:39.080 --> 03:38:43.960
[Guest]: high, as you know. I mean, there are only two test matches in the history of cricket named

03:38:43.960 --> 03:38:49.000
[Guest]: after the player. One is Mankad's test of 1952, Lords. The other is Botham's test of

03:38:49.000 --> 03:38:58.600
[Guest]: Headingley of 1981. He has got a first wicket partnership with Pankaj Roy, which stood for like

03:38:58.600 --> 03:39:09.640
[Guest]: decades and decades from 1955 till maybe early 2000, you know. And the influence he had on players

03:39:09.640 --> 03:39:15.880
[Guest]: and team, he was captain, he was not captain. He was a bit of a rebel, you know. He had a mind of

03:39:15.880 --> 03:39:23.240
[Guest]: his own. He had a sharp tongue, as one gathers. I spoke to the late Ashok Mankad, his son. You know,

03:39:23.240 --> 03:39:27.240
[Guest]: Ashok used to always refer to him as Vinu Bhai. He wouldn't say my father or my dad and this, that.

03:39:27.240 --> 03:39:31.240
[Guest]: He would say Vinu Bhai. And he said, there was nothing that Vinu Bhai didn't know about cricket.

03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:37.640
[Guest]: He knew everything. He says the greatest quality in him was he would read batsman's mind. Now,

03:39:37.640 --> 03:39:45.080
[Guest]: that's a way of putting it. But he was one jump ahead. When we watch a Shane Vaughan or an RR

03:39:45.080 --> 03:39:51.880
[Guest]: Vaughan or an R Ashwin bowl today, it's exactly that. You know, they're plotting and planning

03:39:51.880 --> 03:39:57.640
[Guest]: one delivery to another. Something is brewing in their mind and then, yes, they will get hit,

03:39:57.640 --> 03:40:02.760
[Guest]: you know, something will happen. But the effort always to get the better… It's an ego battle

03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:08.040
[Guest]: with the batsman. And then, the role is reversed when he's batting. I mean, apart from the great

03:40:08.040 --> 03:40:15.640
[Guest]: Kapil Dev and again the stats and all that, but I can't see how Vinu Mankad, who in my opinion,

03:40:15.640 --> 03:40:23.880
[Guest]: was an even greater personality from 1947 period till, say, 60, than even Vijay Merchant,

03:40:24.680 --> 03:40:30.840
[Guest]: for his deeds and his achievements, you know, how he cannot be part of a great Indian all-time 11.

03:40:30.840 --> 03:40:34.840
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to end the episode later on when we end the episode by asking you to name your

03:40:34.840 --> 03:40:39.880
[Amit Varma]: Indian all-time 11. And I'll share mine as well. But before that, let's continue talking about

03:40:39.880 --> 03:40:44.440
[Amit Varma]: these great players very quickly. And I'll link them all to a question. And I have a question

03:40:44.440 --> 03:40:48.520
[Amit Varma]: here about the spin quartet. And you have some excellent writing in your book about the quartet.

03:40:48.520 --> 03:40:53.000
[Amit Varma]: And my question is this, that when we look at the past, we are essentially cherry-picking

03:40:53.000 --> 03:40:56.840
[Amit Varma]: moments and memories. Correct. And it is likely that we will remember the highlights. Yeah.

03:40:56.840 --> 03:41:00.680
[Amit Varma]: While when we look at the present, we don't cherry-pick the highlights. We know the whole

03:41:00.680 --> 03:41:06.280
[Amit Varma]: thing, what's and all, right. And that brings a danger that we can sometimes romanticize the past.

03:41:06.280 --> 03:41:11.080
[Amit Varma]: Yes. And we can romanticize the quartet, like much as they are, of course, legends,

03:41:11.080 --> 03:41:17.800
[Amit Varma]: and I love reading about them and all of that. It also seems to me that, like in my all-time

03:41:17.800 --> 03:41:22.200
[Amit Varma]: Indian 11, there's no one from the quartet because, you know, Vinu bhai is there, so you don't need

03:41:22.200 --> 03:41:27.320
[Amit Varma]: Bedi. And I'm picking Ashwin as my off-spinner and that's just what it is. And, you know,

03:41:27.320 --> 03:41:32.840
[Amit Varma]: if I had to have a leg-spinner, I'd, you know, pick Kumle. Yeah. So is that also a danger then

03:41:32.840 --> 03:41:39.000
[Amit Varma]: of looking at the past, which also might do injustice to the people themselves? Because

03:41:39.000 --> 03:41:43.320
[Amit Varma]: then if you ignore their warts, you are actually doing an injustice to them because you're looking

03:41:43.320 --> 03:41:48.200
[Amit Varma]: at them almost as mythical figures and not acknowledging the real human challenges that

03:41:48.200 --> 03:41:52.760
[Amit Varma]: they faced and they overcame. Like, you know, Prasanna in those overseas tours of New Zealand

03:41:52.760 --> 03:41:57.240
[Amit Varma]: and Australia and the way he bowled and all of that. Incredible achievement. But, you know,

03:41:58.440 --> 03:42:02.440
[Guest]: what's your take on this? So I think, yes, there is the pitfall. I mean, you can look at them with,

03:42:02.440 --> 03:42:07.400
[Guest]: you know, those tinted glasses and say everything about them was great. Perhaps not. You know,

03:42:07.400 --> 03:42:12.120
[Guest]: I mean, you've got Kumble and you've got Ashwin and you've got Harbhajan, who's got 400 plus

03:42:12.120 --> 03:42:16.040
[Guest]: wickets. They've been some stellar performers. How do you, how would they compare? I think,

03:42:16.040 --> 03:42:21.080
[Guest]: obviously, there's a romanticization of their performances. There's also,

03:42:21.080 --> 03:42:25.720
[Guest]: you know, distance and nostalgia makes everything look warmer and there's a glow about it.

03:42:25.720 --> 03:42:32.200
[Guest]: But having said that, I think one has to look at it, you know, on harder or sharper scrutiny,

03:42:32.200 --> 03:42:36.840
[Guest]: you'll find that there are great virtues. For instance, Prasanna's performances in the 60s

03:42:36.840 --> 03:42:44.280
[Guest]: overseas in Australia, in 67, in New Zealand, they were fantastic. He picked up so many wickets.

03:42:44.920 --> 03:42:48.920
[Guest]: Bishan Singh Bedi. And look at their domestic performances. Chandrashekhar,

03:42:48.920 --> 03:42:55.240
[Guest]: winning a match on his own at the Oval in 1971 is a seminal moment, as we know.

03:42:55.240 --> 03:43:01.640
[Guest]: Almost unplayable on his day on Indian pitches, certainly. But look at what his handicap was,

03:43:01.640 --> 03:43:06.760
[Guest]: how he came. I think also, when he worked in Venkat Raghavan, perhaps the most underrated,

03:43:06.760 --> 03:43:11.720
[Guest]: most unsung, came back at the age of 38 and also bowled. He just suffered in comparison

03:43:11.720 --> 03:43:17.240
[Guest]: because Prasanna was around and I think Prasanna was favoured by Pataudi, you know, as the,

03:43:17.240 --> 03:43:21.800
[Guest]: perhaps he thought he was the better bowler. Don't forget, Prasanna also missed out five years.

03:43:21.800 --> 03:43:27.800
[Guest]: He made his debut in 62 and then came back again in 66, 67 because he was studying. He was becoming

03:43:27.800 --> 03:43:33.160
[Guest]: an engineer. Incidentally, the literacy levels of the Indian cricket team used to be very high

03:43:33.160 --> 03:43:37.720
[Guest]: till 20 years back. So many engineers, yeah. So many engineers. Graduates were almost everybody.

03:43:38.360 --> 03:43:42.920
[Guest]: Now, I think, apart from Ashwin, they might, it'll be very difficult to find another graduate.

03:43:42.920 --> 03:43:47.000
[Guest]: But that's also the way the game has changed, you know, with so many people getting in at 18, 19,

03:43:47.000 --> 03:43:52.760
[Guest]: nevertheless. So, Bedi, Prasanna and Chandrasekhar and Venkat Raghavan, they came at a certain time

03:43:53.480 --> 03:44:00.440
[Guest]: when India was really struggling to win matches and especially with, even look at the background.

03:44:01.160 --> 03:44:05.960
[Guest]: Vinu Mankad had retired. Jasu Patel had retired. Gulam Ahmed had retired. They were

03:44:05.960 --> 03:44:15.480
[Guest]: very big bowlers in the 1950s. The big loss was Subhash Gupte, who should have been on the 1961-62

03:44:15.480 --> 03:44:20.040
[Guest]: to the West Indies. He wasn't because, you know, he and Kripal Singh…

03:44:20.040 --> 03:44:21.160
[Amit Varma]: That phone call incident.

03:44:21.160 --> 03:44:24.280
[Guest]: Phone call incident with some girl and, you know, the selectors took,

03:44:24.280 --> 03:44:29.080
[Guest]: umbrillated, you know, their hotel room and those were the ways in which selections were done.

03:44:29.640 --> 03:44:34.440
[Guest]: So, he quit in a half. He went and, you know, settled down in the West Indies. So, there was

03:44:34.440 --> 03:44:40.280
[Guest]: a void of match-winning spinners. Yes, there was Bapu Nadkarni and Chandu Borde and Salim Durrani,

03:44:40.280 --> 03:44:45.000
[Guest]: who was in and out of the team. But when these guys came together and Pataudi,

03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:51.160
[Guest]: in a sense, masterminded, okay, let's get an all-spin attack and, you know, he'll open the

03:44:51.160 --> 03:44:55.800
[Guest]: bowling or Gavaskar or somebody else will come and bowl one or two overs, roll the ball along

03:44:55.800 --> 03:45:00.520
[Guest]: the ground. You've not seen those matches. I've been as a youngster, you know, and they would,

03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:05.720
[Guest]: after every ball, the fielders would roll the ball back to the bowler to get the shine off.

03:45:05.720 --> 03:45:07.080
[Guest]: Yeah, you wanted the spinners off.

03:45:07.080 --> 03:45:10.360
[Guest]: You wanted the spinners off on in the third or fourth over. And then,

03:45:10.360 --> 03:45:15.720
[Guest]: there would be this roar across the stadium if Bedi got the ball or Chandra. And, you know,

03:45:15.720 --> 03:45:20.360
[Guest]: when they ran into bowl, there would be this bowl, that sound would come. You know,

03:45:20.360 --> 03:45:27.400
[Guest]: 30,000 people screaming. So, that created a certain aura, which is magnificent. And then,

03:45:27.400 --> 03:45:34.600
[Guest]: they charmed everybody wherever they went. Because these kind of spinners were not seen in England

03:45:34.600 --> 03:45:39.320
[Guest]: or Australia with so much success. Of course, they also had their great spinners, you know,

03:45:39.320 --> 03:45:45.640
[Guest]: Underwood and Ashley Mallet. But not so many numbers, so many of different types. So,

03:45:45.640 --> 03:45:51.880
[Guest]: it just added to the whole romance. But I think that they were 800-plus wickets between them,

03:45:51.880 --> 03:45:58.360
[Guest]: you know. And I think with better fielding, we all talk about the great fielding setup,

03:45:58.360 --> 03:46:05.240
[Guest]: which was also there, Wadekar, Solkar, Abed Ali, Venkat Raghavan himself. But they all came,

03:46:05.240 --> 03:46:11.880
[Guest]: I mean, fielding standards, when you look at their averages, you'll find that they are 29-30-31.

03:46:11.880 --> 03:46:17.160
[Guest]: If the outfielding was as good as it is today, it would have been better. Some of the lofted

03:46:17.160 --> 03:46:22.680
[Guest]: shots which should have been taken would have been caught. So, I think that there's a lot of merit.

03:46:22.680 --> 03:46:27.880
[Guest]: You know, ultimately, you can't compare players from one generation to another. That is always

03:46:27.880 --> 03:46:32.920
[Guest]: the danger. So, it's not to say that Harbhajan is not a good bowler or Ashwin is not a fantastic

03:46:32.920 --> 03:46:38.920
[Guest]: bowler. And Kumble, of course, has got his own monumental stature or status in the game.

03:46:38.920 --> 03:46:46.920
[Guest]: I think that they provided that richness of talent and skill, which made India synonymous

03:46:46.920 --> 03:46:53.640
[Guest]: with great spin. Not that there were no spinners earlier. There was Vinu Mankar, there was Jassu,

03:46:53.640 --> 03:47:01.880
[Guest]: there was Gulam Ahmed, there was Subhash Gupte. 50s and 60s, 65 onwards or 66 onwards is when

03:47:03.000 --> 03:47:06.920
[Guest]: this quartet comes into play. And for about 10-12 years, they hold sway.

03:47:07.480 --> 03:47:12.040
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, if people give credit to Clive Lloyd for figuring out that in West Indies should

03:47:12.040 --> 03:47:16.440
[Amit Varma]: play to their strengths and bowl with four fast bowlers, equal credit to Pataudi a few years

03:47:16.440 --> 03:47:21.080
[Amit Varma]: before that for getting out the whole quartet plan. And as you said, you know, the incentives

03:47:21.080 --> 03:47:25.640
[Amit Varma]: again, we had great close-in fielders because we had great spinners. So, much greater demand

03:47:25.640 --> 03:47:30.600
[Amit Varma]: for close-in fielders like Solkar and Yajubendra Singh and all two kind of…

03:47:30.600 --> 03:47:36.040
[Guest]: I think Pataudi was very clever and very decisive. You know, I mean, some people would argue that

03:47:36.040 --> 03:47:40.440
[Guest]: the short leg fielding position was actually devised by him, where Solkar excelled. Because

03:47:40.440 --> 03:47:43.400
[Guest]: before that, you don't find short legs, you find backward short leg.

03:47:43.400 --> 03:47:44.200
[Guest]: Oh, fascinating.

03:47:44.200 --> 03:47:46.520
[Guest]: You know, not so much as forward short leg.

03:47:46.520 --> 03:47:51.800
[Amit Varma]: So, here's a question about Pataudi. I think in some ways, if you again just look at the

03:47:51.800 --> 03:47:56.760
[Amit Varma]: bare biographical details, it's easy to be unfair to Pataudi. Because what do you see,

03:47:56.760 --> 03:48:01.160
[Amit Varma]: like you have a great chapter in your book called Merchant Bags His Tiger by Mihir Bose,

03:48:01.160 --> 03:48:06.040
[Amit Varma]: where he talks about how Vijay Merchant as head of selectors, you know, got Pataudi kicked off

03:48:06.040 --> 03:48:10.360
[Amit Varma]: from the captaincy. And one speculation is it is because if Iftikar Ali Pataudi, you know,

03:48:10.360 --> 03:48:15.560
[Amit Varma]: Mansoor's father had, you know, treated Merchant badly at one point in time. But regardless,

03:48:15.560 --> 03:48:20.520
[Amit Varma]: he loses the captaincy, it goes to Wadikar and Wadikar promptly wins in 71 in West Indies and

03:48:21.400 --> 03:48:26.520
[Amit Varma]: England, Seminole, Ipokil, all of that. And suddenly in your mind's eye, Wadikar is a great

03:48:26.520 --> 03:48:31.080
[Amit Varma]: captain and who is Pataudi? But actually, Pataudi was not just a brilliant captain,

03:48:31.080 --> 03:48:34.920
[Amit Varma]: brilliant batsman, brilliant thinker of the game. I know you admire him a lot. So,

03:48:34.920 --> 03:48:36.600
[Guest]: tell me a little bit about him.

03:48:36.600 --> 03:48:40.520
[Guest]: Pataudi, I admired from the time I got to know about cricket. I mean, you know,

03:48:40.520 --> 03:48:45.080
[Guest]: your favourites keep changing. My first favourites were Rohan Kanhai, Garth McKenzie, Graham McKenzie,

03:48:45.080 --> 03:48:50.840
[Guest]: and then suddenly became very quickly, swiftly, Yaseema and Pataudi. And I had this great desire

03:48:50.840 --> 03:48:56.520
[Guest]: to meet him. He used to be living in Bombay in those days, maybe early 70s. You know,

03:48:56.520 --> 03:49:00.920
[Guest]: he used to be always at the Bombay gym, you know, playing snooker or playing sports. He was a

03:49:00.920 --> 03:49:05.640
[Guest]: multi-talented sportsperson. And I knew somebody who was working there, some distant relative of

03:49:05.640 --> 03:49:11.000
[Guest]: mine. I said, I must somehow have to meet Pataudi. He says he comes every afternoon for a tipple,

03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:14.760
[Guest]: for a drink or a beer, glass of beer, and then he, you know, whatever, he has lunch and go. I said,

03:49:14.760 --> 03:49:17.960
[Guest]: you have to get me in. He said, but you're not allowed. You know, under 18, you're not allowed.

03:49:17.960 --> 03:49:23.720
[Guest]: I was not 18. So, I said, listen, what I'll do is, I'll make a false side-lock, side-burn.

03:49:23.720 --> 03:49:29.560
[Guest]: And I had a, my moustache had sprouted. I said, I'll darken it. You have to smuggle me in. I'll

03:49:29.560 --> 03:49:37.400
[Guest]: look 18 plus. So, he smuggled me in at the Bombay gym. And I had a scrap of paper with a little pen

03:49:37.960 --> 03:49:42.680
[Guest]: and I went up to him. He was sitting with his, you know, this cap he used to wear at a slant.

03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:45.560
[Guest]: And he was smoking a cigarette and not looking at me. And I said,

03:49:46.280 --> 03:49:53.160
[Guest]: sir, autograph. And he looked at me and he signed that piece of paper and went back to whatever he

03:49:53.160 --> 03:49:57.240
[Guest]: was doing. And I didn't have to wait long because I was worried I'll get caught. So, I grabbed that

03:49:57.240 --> 03:50:03.400
[Guest]: and I ran away. When I met him much later as a professional and I talked to him about this,

03:50:03.400 --> 03:50:06.120
[Guest]: he had no memory of it at all. Obviously.

03:50:06.120 --> 03:50:10.760
[Guest]: Obviously, obviously. But I asked him, I said, you know, those were I think the days when he

03:50:10.760 --> 03:50:17.400
[Guest]: had lost his captaincy. So, I asked him, I said, you know, what were you doing? He says, no, I mean,

03:50:17.400 --> 03:50:22.280
[Guest]: you know, I was trying to get into politics. He had misadventures of getting into politics and

03:50:22.280 --> 03:50:27.800
[Guest]: this and that. But, you know, I always wanted to play. I didn't want to tour. So, I didn't go to

03:50:27.800 --> 03:50:32.600
[Guest]: England in 1974. I didn't go to the West Indies. I think he was obviously miffed that his captaincy

03:50:32.600 --> 03:50:38.920
[Guest]: was taken away. But he came back in Captain India in that fantastic series against West Indies,

03:50:38.920 --> 03:50:44.600
[Guest]: which we lost 3-2. But he just breathed life into it with his captaincy and the bowling of these

03:50:44.600 --> 03:50:52.840
[Guest]: series, this quartet. And I kept, you know, asking him that what was it about you and

03:50:54.760 --> 03:51:00.760
[Guest]: merchant that somehow didn't work out? Why did he? He's saying some things are best forgotten.

03:51:00.760 --> 03:51:06.360
[Guest]: You know, I moved on. That's it. So, Tiger Pathodi was very enigmatic. I met him many times

03:51:06.360 --> 03:51:12.520
[Guest]: in Delhi, been to his house. At one point in time, I was planning to do a book along with him

03:51:12.520 --> 03:51:17.960
[Guest]: and Rahul Rawat and Rajsingh Dungarpur on the history of Indian cricket. In each one of them,

03:51:17.960 --> 03:51:21.880
[Guest]: doing different eras. You know, and he was very excited. It didn't happen.

03:51:23.160 --> 03:51:29.000
[Guest]: And, you know, as I mentioned that last, the meeting I had was that Rajsingh Dungarpur,

03:51:29.000 --> 03:51:35.240
[Guest]: he had this great sense of humour, you know, where he said ICC is like the voice of cricket

03:51:35.240 --> 03:51:40.600
[Guest]: and BCCI is the voice of cricket. He had these smart one-liners, very sharp in his observation,

03:51:40.600 --> 03:51:44.920
[Guest]: very great, dull sense of humour, not very elaborate. You know, you sometimes think

03:51:46.760 --> 03:51:50.920
[Guest]: he's not saying anything, but it carried a lot of weight. So, he was that kind of a personality.

03:51:50.920 --> 03:51:55.480
[Guest]: And when you look at it from a player's point of view, imagine a guy playing with one eye,

03:51:55.480 --> 03:52:01.160
[Guest]: it's insane. Colin Milburn had a car accident, lost an eye. He was an England batsman. He came

03:52:01.160 --> 03:52:09.080
[Guest]: back and he couldn't last one test match, you know, and he gave up. So, for him to play with

03:52:09.080 --> 03:52:14.840
[Guest]: one eye, I mean, there have been people, Azeem Hafeez used to be a Pakistani bowler with two

03:52:14.840 --> 03:52:21.160
[Guest]: fingers less in one hand and he bowled. But sight is a problem. B.S. Chandrashekhar, polio-affected

03:52:21.160 --> 03:52:27.960
[Guest]: hand, you know. But sight is everything in sport. For a batsman. For a batsman. And to survive,

03:52:27.960 --> 03:52:33.480
[Guest]: his batting average, when you talked of the figures not being flattering, he made six centuries,

03:52:33.480 --> 03:52:39.480
[Guest]: ten centuries and the batting average was about 40, except for his last two, three years. And

03:52:39.480 --> 03:52:44.040
[Amit Varma]: his last years can be misleading. Like even with Gundappa Vishwanath, you know, people used to say,

03:52:44.040 --> 03:52:48.680
[Amit Varma]: oh, his average is in 50. So, I remember when I was in Cricken 4, I actually tracked his career

03:52:48.680 --> 03:52:52.600
[Amit Varma]: record and it was above 50 for most of it. He and Gavaskar were neck and neck. They were

03:52:52.600 --> 03:52:56.280
[Amit Varma]: neck and neck. For the five, seven, eight years of their life, you know. Right at the end,

03:52:56.280 --> 03:53:01.720
[Guest]: he had a bad batch and it fell away. So, you know. But that also is, in a sense, Gavaskar's greatness.

03:53:01.720 --> 03:53:08.280
[Guest]: You know, to keep the ambition alive and the grind and the, you know, I must, I mean, relentless.

03:53:08.280 --> 03:53:10.680
[Amit Varma]: And also, as we discussed, to quit at his peak.

03:53:10.680 --> 03:53:11.720
[Amit Varma]: And to quit at his peak.

03:53:11.720 --> 03:53:12.680
[Guest]: With that 96.

03:53:12.680 --> 03:53:18.040
[Guest]: Yes. You know, I mean, Gavaskar is a phenomenon. He's a phenomenon. I mean, you know, he's not

03:53:20.040 --> 03:53:24.600
[Guest]: a drudge batsman. You know, a lot of people mistake that, you know, he was a,

03:53:25.880 --> 03:53:30.280
[Guest]: ek end pakad ke, you know, he would do, just keep accumulating runs. That was not. He was a

03:53:30.280 --> 03:53:36.920
[Guest]: terrific stroke player. He had all the strokes in his arm. He was, you know, virtuosity, batting

03:53:36.920 --> 03:53:42.200
[Amit Varma]: virtuosity personified. Technical virtuosity. I often think that when we think of cricketers,

03:53:42.200 --> 03:53:46.600
[Amit Varma]: you know, we put them in these slots and we think of them as just that. For example,

03:53:46.600 --> 03:53:51.560
[Amit Varma]: when people talk about Tendulkar and Dravid, you know, for them, Tendulkar is a great natural

03:53:51.560 --> 03:53:55.560
[Amit Varma]: talent and Dravid is a great technique. And I'm like, the opposite is also true.

03:53:55.560 --> 03:53:55.800
[Amit Varma]: Of course.

03:53:55.800 --> 03:53:59.960
[Amit Varma]: Tendulkar's technique is incredible and Dravid is so talented.

03:53:59.960 --> 03:54:00.440
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

03:54:00.440 --> 03:54:03.160
[Amit Varma]: And to, you know, to pigeonhole them like that.

03:54:03.160 --> 03:54:05.800
[Guest]: You know, sometimes they have to adjust within their own,

03:54:07.160 --> 03:54:10.280
[Guest]: what are you doing in this team? What's your role in this team, you know?

03:54:10.280 --> 03:54:14.920
[Guest]: So, that's something that you have to, I mean, look at Gavaskar's series against

03:54:14.920 --> 03:54:19.720
[Guest]: West Indies in 1983. There are shades of everything in that series.

03:54:19.720 --> 03:54:22.200
[Guest]: That 29th hundred where he attacked the West Indies.

03:54:22.200 --> 03:54:26.840
[Guest]: 121 against West Indies, Delhi. Then he makes 236, which is completely different.

03:54:26.840 --> 03:54:27.960
[Guest]: Completely different.

03:54:27.960 --> 03:54:31.400
[Guest]: Zero for two. He walks out to bat at number four. He's not opening the innings.

03:54:31.400 --> 03:54:34.120
[Amit Varma]: And even there, apparently, it was politics because I think Kirmani was

03:54:34.760 --> 03:54:39.720
[Amit Varma]: not out on 60-something and he hoped to get his hundred and people thought Gavaskar can go on to

03:54:39.720 --> 03:54:43.960
[Amit Varma]: a triple hundred. But if I remember correctly, Kapil, who was captain, declared because there

03:54:43.960 --> 03:54:48.200
[Amit Varma]: was some point system for man of the series and he was ahead and I think he didn't want

03:54:48.200 --> 03:54:51.640
[Amit Varma]: some marshal or somebody, somebody in the West Indies team to go ahead of him.

03:54:51.640 --> 03:54:53.640
[Amit Varma]: Oh, I can't remember that. No.

03:54:53.640 --> 03:54:55.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. Yeah. No. Okay. It's a vague memory.

03:54:55.480 --> 03:54:59.000
[Guest]: Yeah. No, no, I can't remember that. But 236, I do remember. Zero for two.

03:54:59.000 --> 03:54:59.560
[Amit Varma]: No doubt.

03:54:59.560 --> 03:55:05.800
[Guest]: Yeah. And, you know, he used to, he had a room in Connemara. Though he was not captain,

03:55:05.800 --> 03:55:10.440
[Guest]: he had a room to himself. And one, I went to meet him because he was also writing for Midday.

03:55:10.440 --> 03:55:11.000
[Guest]: Oh, right.

03:55:11.000 --> 03:55:15.800
[Guest]: So, in those days. So, the two guys sitting in his room were Gundappa Vishwanath,

03:55:15.800 --> 03:55:20.760
[Guest]: his brother-in-law, and Dom Morris, who was writing his biography. Now, if you met

03:55:20.760 --> 03:55:25.720
[Guest]: both of them, you could, you know, I mean, you can imagine the conversation between Dom Morris

03:55:25.720 --> 03:55:30.760
[Guest]: used to speak through clenched teeth in, you know, very accented, heavily accented English.

03:55:30.760 --> 03:55:36.280
[Guest]: And Gundappa Vishwanath in his Karnataka, you know, accent. And both of them, you know,

03:55:36.280 --> 03:55:39.880
[Guest]: talking to each other. I sat there for half an hour. I couldn't make head or tail of what each

03:55:39.880 --> 03:55:45.320
[Guest]: was saying to the other, but they got along like a house on fire. So, and Gavaskar said,

03:55:45.320 --> 03:55:48.120
[Guest]: let them be. He went off to sleep because he was batting the next day.

03:55:48.120 --> 03:55:54.760
[Amit Varma]: Is it possible for a young journalist today to have the same kind of career you've had?

03:55:54.760 --> 03:55:57.320
[Amit Varma]: Because today you will simply not get access to these people.

03:55:57.320 --> 03:56:00.680
[Guest]: That's the problem. That's a big problem because the access has become, you know,

03:56:00.680 --> 03:56:05.880
[Guest]: the access has now become formalized to the extent that every match you have a player come and give

03:56:05.880 --> 03:56:12.280
[Guest]: address the media. You know, that's it. The rest of the access is not easy. And more so now in

03:56:12.280 --> 03:56:17.800
[Guest]: today's world where all these players, they are superstars, have their own social media accounts,

03:56:17.800 --> 03:56:22.200
[Guest]: which give them millions of people as followers. And they really, I'm talking to my followers.

03:56:23.080 --> 03:56:27.720
[Guest]: Why do I need you? And there's some major explanation that has to be given some controversy

03:56:27.720 --> 03:56:32.520
[Guest]: or something. It's very difficult to get access to players. And that I think is a challenge.

03:56:32.520 --> 03:56:37.400
[Guest]: It's a growing challenge for, you know, people in the media and journalism.

03:56:37.400 --> 03:56:40.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no. And as far as social media is concerned, like one person,

03:56:40.440 --> 03:56:44.440
[Guest]: I'm really impressed by is Ashwin, the kind of things he does on YouTube and as a creator.

03:56:44.440 --> 03:56:50.760
[Guest]: He's a fascinating character apart from his, the way he has grown as a cricketer and become that

03:56:50.760 --> 03:56:56.600
[Guest]: wicket-taking bowler, you know, which at one point in time, it seemed like his, he might be,

03:56:56.600 --> 03:57:02.200
[Guest]: you know, career might finish prematurely. And then he's just become stronger and stronger in

03:57:02.200 --> 03:57:07.560
[Guest]: his bowling, batting, little cussed about what he wants to do, a little prickly as a personality,

03:57:07.560 --> 03:57:13.800
[Guest]: which is also extremely, you know, fascinating. He has a mind of his own. And I think he's also

03:57:13.800 --> 03:57:20.360
[Guest]: realized that, you know, he can handle a different portfolio using his cricketing clout or his

03:57:20.360 --> 03:57:28.600
[Guest]: persona and his expertise to be in the media, be upfront and facing audience and fellow players.

03:57:28.600 --> 03:57:32.440
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I think it's absolutely fantastic. No, simply tremendous because combination of

03:57:32.440 --> 03:57:37.240
[Amit Varma]: talent, attitude, intelligence, all of these things, which is so rare. Very rarely do you,

03:57:37.240 --> 03:57:41.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, find that kind of confluence. Maybe Dravid is an earlier confluence. But what

03:57:41.480 --> 03:57:46.840
[Amit Varma]: Ashwin is also doing is, you know, there are two interesting kinds of stardom. One is where you are

03:57:46.840 --> 03:57:50.920
[Amit Varma]: larger than life, as our film stars and cricketers have tended to be, where you're worshipped by

03:57:50.920 --> 03:57:55.640
[Amit Varma]: people, people may actually literally build temples for you. And the other kind of stardom,

03:57:55.640 --> 03:57:59.720
[Amit Varma]: which is a more modern kind of connect that people have with their audiences is more intimate.

03:57:59.720 --> 03:57:59.960
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

03:57:59.960 --> 03:58:03.400
[Amit Varma]: Where they feel that they know you, you're talking like them, you're sitting with them.

03:58:03.400 --> 03:58:08.520
[Amit Varma]: And I think through his YouTube and through his Twitter, Ashwin kind of approximates that and

03:58:08.520 --> 03:58:11.560
[Amit Varma]: therefore actually, you know, kind of manages both in a sense, which is fascinating.

03:58:11.560 --> 03:58:14.920
[Guest]: He's doing a marvellous job because he's making the effort to go out and reach out to

03:58:15.960 --> 03:58:21.720
[Guest]: an audience, you know. I mean, they may or may not be his fans, but he's reaching out to an

03:58:21.720 --> 03:58:27.160
[Guest]: audience which in a different avatar altogether, which is absolutely fantastic.

03:58:27.160 --> 03:58:31.560
[Amit Varma]: Mind-blowing. So, you know, I've taken a lot of your time. You've been very generous with me. So,

03:58:31.560 --> 03:58:34.280
[Amit Varma]: I'll now ask you for your all-time Indian 11.

03:58:34.280 --> 03:58:39.800
[Guest]: My all-time Indian 11. Oh, that's always a tough call. But let's see. Test 11.

03:58:41.160 --> 03:58:45.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, let's go with, let's be purist today. I think T20, it's too early to form judgment

03:58:45.640 --> 03:58:47.080
[Guest]: because so much is still happening.

03:58:47.080 --> 03:58:54.440
[Guest]: Yeah. So, I would say that Gavaskar, Sehwag, certainly. Tendulkar, number four.

03:58:56.360 --> 03:58:57.720
[Guest]: Number five, I would put Kohli.

03:58:58.760 --> 03:58:59.000
[Guest]: Three.

03:58:59.000 --> 03:59:05.560
[Guest]: Number three would be David. Yeah. Number five, number six, I would put.

03:59:06.760 --> 03:59:07.320
[Guest]: Vinu Bhai.

03:59:07.320 --> 03:59:13.240
[Guest]: Vinu Bhai. Number seven for me would be Kapil Dev. Number eight, MS Dhoni.

03:59:13.240 --> 03:59:15.480
[Amit Varma]: We are identical so far. Carry on.

03:59:15.480 --> 03:59:16.280
[Amit Varma]: We are identical?

03:59:16.280 --> 03:59:17.320
[Guest]: So far, we are identical.

03:59:19.240 --> 03:59:26.600
[Guest]: Zaheer Khan, I would include as another fast bowler. It gets tougher with the spinners because

03:59:26.600 --> 03:59:29.800
[Guest]: even Ravindra Jadeja has got a very impressive and interesting record.

03:59:29.800 --> 03:59:30.920
[Amit Varma]: Now coming into his own.

03:59:30.920 --> 03:59:34.120
[Guest]: Now coming into his own. And also as an all-rounder, there is Ashwin.

03:59:35.000 --> 03:59:36.040
[Guest]: How many have we got as yet?

03:59:37.320 --> 03:59:39.960
[Amit Varma]: We got to nine with Zaheer. Nine was your Zaheer.

03:59:39.960 --> 03:59:47.240
[Guest]: Right. Nine is Zaheer. So, ten would be, I would go with Prasanna.

03:59:48.200 --> 03:59:53.800
[Guest]: You know, I would go with Irapalli Prasanna. And 11 would be,

03:59:53.800 --> 03:59:59.880
[Guest]: we have already got Zaheer and Kapil. We have to include one more fast bowler.

04:00:00.760 --> 04:00:06.360
[Guest]: That's a tough one. I am stuck on this, you know, whether it should be Bumrah.

04:00:06.360 --> 04:00:14.120
[Guest]: Though it's very early, you know. Between Bumrah and Srinath is where my needle gets stuck.

04:00:14.120 --> 04:00:17.640
[Guest]: But let me see. I will actually go with Bumrah. He has made such a huge impact.

04:00:18.280 --> 04:00:22.360
[Guest]: You know, 100 wickets in 24 tests, winning matches overseas.

04:00:22.360 --> 04:00:26.120
[Guest]: He has just been… But it's a very tough call between him and Srinath.

04:00:26.120 --> 04:00:32.120
[Amit Varma]: So, we were the same till number eight. And number nine, I would pick Ashwin over Pras.

04:00:32.120 --> 04:00:39.320
[Amit Varma]: And 10 and 11 is a bit of a problem. I would actually just go on faith and go with Bumrah

04:00:39.320 --> 04:00:42.680
[Amit Varma]: as my second choice for fast bowler. Because I think he is going to end up as

04:00:43.400 --> 04:00:47.880
[Amit Varma]: being considered one of the greats. And 11 would either be Zaheer if I want three fast bowlers.

04:00:47.880 --> 04:00:51.080
[Amit Varma]: Or if the match is in Motera or something, then I will just take Kumble.

04:00:51.080 --> 04:00:55.480
[Guest]: Yeah. Oh, Kumble. Of course, Kumble. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am sorry.

04:00:55.480 --> 04:00:56.680
[Amit Varma]: So, instead of Prasanna, Kumble.

04:00:56.680 --> 04:00:59.080
[Guest]: Instead of Prasanna, Kumble. Yeah. How could I forget Kumble?

04:00:59.080 --> 04:01:00.200
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah. That's so great.

04:01:00.200 --> 04:01:04.600
[Guest]: So, you are right. I mean, the choice between the 11th person would depend on the track

04:01:04.600 --> 04:01:08.440
[Guest]: where you are playing. So, therefore, the best way is to have a choice of 12 players.

04:01:09.000 --> 04:01:10.360
[Amit Varma]: So, you interchange one.

04:01:10.360 --> 04:01:12.120
[Guest]: So, we are both happy that way. There is no dilemma.

04:01:14.120 --> 04:01:18.760
[Guest]: And see, Kumble also serves the purpose of… He can also bat a bit. He has got a test 100.

04:01:18.760 --> 04:01:19.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah.

04:01:19.240 --> 04:01:19.720
[Amit Varma]: You know.

04:01:19.720 --> 04:01:21.560
[Guest]: Ashwin can… He is a heck of a batsman.

04:01:21.560 --> 04:01:22.520
[Guest]: He has got multiple 100s.

04:01:22.520 --> 04:01:25.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. Even Bumrah can be useful.

04:01:25.320 --> 04:01:32.600
[Guest]: Yes. And I mean, Kumble has many roles that he can play, including a captain.

04:01:33.560 --> 04:01:34.520
[Guest]: You know. So…

04:01:34.520 --> 04:01:35.400
[Guest]: Who would your coach be?

04:01:36.600 --> 04:01:38.520
[Amit Varma]: From those who have been coach of the Indian team?

04:01:38.520 --> 04:01:41.400
[Amit Varma]: From those who have been coach, unfortunately. Otherwise, in an ideal world…

04:01:41.400 --> 04:01:41.720
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:01:41.720 --> 04:01:43.960
[Guest]: I mean, you could just pick Pataudi, for example.

04:01:43.960 --> 04:01:49.160
[Guest]: Yeah. Again, very tough call. My choice would be between two Bombay guys.

04:01:49.160 --> 04:01:50.040
[Guest]: Ravi Shastri and…

04:01:50.040 --> 04:01:51.240
[Guest]: And Ajit Wadekar.

04:01:51.240 --> 04:01:51.740
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:01:53.320 --> 04:01:55.800
[Guest]: Ajit Wadekar was a sterling chap to have.

04:01:55.800 --> 04:01:59.800
[Guest]: You know, he is one of those guys who really nursed Sachin Tendulkar.

04:01:59.800 --> 04:02:00.360
[Unknown]: Yeah.

04:02:00.360 --> 04:02:02.520
[Guest]: You know, from 1992-93.

04:02:04.280 --> 04:02:09.240
[Guest]: I think he was… And also because he was from Bombay. So, there was an affinity with Wadekar.

04:02:09.240 --> 04:02:13.320
[Guest]: But also, a man of great… A very genial chap.

04:02:13.320 --> 04:02:13.560
[Unknown]: Yeah.

04:02:13.560 --> 04:02:21.480
[Guest]: He had his own flavour to him. Spoke… He was always trying to crack jokes, which sometimes bombed.

04:02:21.480 --> 04:02:24.920
[Guest]: But it didn't deter him. He would crack more jokes to make up for the earlier one.

04:02:25.560 --> 04:02:29.560
[Guest]: And then, he would be great fun on a tour or on an assignment.

04:02:29.560 --> 04:02:33.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, Ayaaz, one, your book is great. It contains multitudes, as I like to say.

04:02:33.880 --> 04:02:34.120
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

04:02:34.120 --> 04:02:37.560
[Amit Varma]: Do I say that about people? It's just… I hope everyone picks it up.

04:02:37.560 --> 04:02:40.440
[Amit Varma]: Not just because I am fortunate enough to be among some very fine names in

04:02:40.440 --> 04:02:42.680
[Amit Varma]: being… having a couple of pieces there.

04:02:42.680 --> 04:02:46.520
[Amit Varma]: But it's just a wonderful book. Made me so nostalgic and made me feel so warm.

04:02:46.520 --> 04:02:50.600
[Amit Varma]: And also, I have not even covered half the questions I had for you, Akeem.

04:02:50.600 --> 04:02:53.640
[Amit Varma]: So, we'll have to, you know, save that for another day.

04:02:53.640 --> 04:02:55.080
[Amit Varma]: But thank you so much for your time.

04:02:55.080 --> 04:02:56.600
[Guest]: Thanks, Amit. Thanks for having me here.

04:02:56.600 --> 04:03:00.600
[Guest]: And I think it's been absolutely wonderful few hours that we spent together.

04:03:00.600 --> 04:03:00.920
[Guest]: Thank you.

04:03:00.920 --> 04:03:29.560
[Amit Varma]: Cheers. Thank you.

04:03:29.560 --> 04:03:32.680
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for listening.
