00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160
[Amit Varma]: There is this glib takedown of a saying, there are two kinds of people in the world, those

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.960
[Amit Varma]: who think there are two kinds of people in the world and those who don't.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.120
[Amit Varma]: I'm wary of generalizing, but I will add to this list of false dichotomies by speculating

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.840
[Amit Varma]: that there might be two kinds of people in the world, those given to self reflection

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.160
[Amit Varma]: and those who do not reflect on themselves.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.440
[Amit Varma]: Now there's obviously a continuum between the two.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.080
[Amit Varma]: So it's perhaps better to talk of the tendency to self reflect, which exists in a lesser

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.200
[Amit Varma]: or greater degree in most people.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.160
[Amit Varma]: When I was younger, I was not given much to self reflection.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.000
[Amit Varma]: I never got meta about myself as it were, I was sure of the talents I had, blind so

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.760
[Amit Varma]: often to my good fortune, unaware of how my character was shaped so often by things outside

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.200
[Amit Varma]: of me, even unaware of my own character.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.880
[Amit Varma]: I didn't think about why I wanted what I wanted, and why I reacted to events around me the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.880
[Amit Varma]: way I did.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.260
[Amit Varma]: I'd like to think that I know myself a bit better now than I did then, but perhaps not

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.760
[Amit Varma]: as well as I could.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.280
[Amit Varma]: And in life, I see people who do no self reflection at all.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.080
[Amit Varma]: And those who do examine themselves, and in doing so can point me to truths about myself

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.080
[Amit Varma]: as well.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.240
[Amit Varma]: That is why I love reading memoirs, a good memoir, by definition, is a reflection on

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.240
[Amit Varma]: the self.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.780
[Amit Varma]: And that's true of the wonderful memoir written by my guest today.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.600
[Amit Varma]: This is also why I love being able to have the long conversations that I have on the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.600
[Amit Varma]: show.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.360
[Amit Varma]: Because my guests trust me enough to open themselves up to me and to speak without filters.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.480
[Amit Varma]: And most of the time, they give me a lot to think about, even after they've gone home,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.880
[Amit Varma]: and the mics are off, and all is silent.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.960
[Unknown]: Have you also felt that way?

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.160
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.160
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.600
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.760
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.800
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is a legendary cricket journalist and editor, Pradeep magazine.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.240
[Amit Varma]: When I started off in cricket journalism in the early 2000s, Pradeep was already one of

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.520
[Amit Varma]: the most respected figures in the game, and was sports editor of the Hindustan Times.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.680
[Amit Varma]: I didn't get to know him too well in those days.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.760
[Amit Varma]: But I heard a lot about how he kickstarted the careers of so many young writers by giving

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.320
[Amit Varma]: them jobs and mentoring them, teaching them his craft.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.880
[Amit Varma]: In the decades before this, he had been a fearless cricket writer, writing a book on

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.320
[Amit Varma]: match fixing that began in 1997 and came out in 1999.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.680
[Amit Varma]: And you'll remember the match fixing scandal really broke in 2000.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.560
[Amit Varma]: He was so far ahead of his time.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.280
[Amit Varma]: The book he wrote then was called Not Quite Cricket.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.320
[Amit Varma]: His latest book, which I love reading, is called Not Just Cricket, a reporter's journey

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.600
[Amit Varma]: through modern India.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.720
[Amit Varma]: It has all the qualities of a good memoir.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.500
[Amit Varma]: It has self reflection, and it tells a story not just of the writer, but also of the times

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.500
[Amit Varma]: he lived in.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.920
[Amit Varma]: It gave me a lot to think about, not least of which was the role of serendipity in our

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.920
[Amit Varma]: lives.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.280
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure you'll enjoy the conversation as much as I did.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.760
[Amit Varma]: But before we get to it, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.520
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more?

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.440
[Amit Varma]: I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.560
[Amit Varma]: This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and essays.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.520
[Amit Varma]: There's a world of knowledge available through the internet.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.080
[Amit Varma]: But the problem we all face is, how do we navigate this knowledge?

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.600
[Amit Varma]: How do we know what to read?

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.760
[Amit Varma]: How do we put the right incentives in place?

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.520
[Amit Varma]: Well, I discovered one way.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.680
[Amit Varma]: A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.400
[Amit Varma]: which aims to help people up level themselves by reading more.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.860
[Amit Varma]: A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called the Daily Reader.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.560
[Amit Varma]: Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.800
[Amit Varma]: The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.400
[Amit Varma]: This helped me build a habit of reading.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.920
[Amit Varma]: At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.280

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.720
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.720
[Guest]: Thank you for having me here on your podcast.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.960
[Amit Varma]: It's such a pleasure seeing you after so many years.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.400
[Amit Varma]: We, you know, I was on that tour of Pakistan in 2006, and, you know, we kind of traveled

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.800
[Amit Varma]: as part of the same contingent here.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.320
[Amit Varma]: And I really loved reading your book, especially the parts of it which are personal and which

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.760
[Amit Varma]: go beyond what you know, like at a professional level, the cricket journalism you have achieved,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.880
[Amit Varma]: we know about it, it's shared, but just sort of the good to go back to your childhood to

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.240
[Amit Varma]: learn about how once you were a cricketer, and you were a ferocious hitter, it seems

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.320
[Amit Varma]: to what's up, you have, you know, it's refreshing to learn that.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.760
[Amit Varma]: And I want to start by talking about something that you mentioned just before this recording

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.240
[Amit Varma]: began, where, you know, when you were asking me about my podcast, I was talking about how

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.000
[Amit Varma]: it's probably changed me as a person or maybe age has done that, in the sense that I am

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.640
[Amit Varma]: less judgmental of people, I am a better listener, I am much more open.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.040
[Amit Varma]: And then you mentioned that had you written this book 10 years ago, though, Shahid, you

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.720
[Amit Varma]: would have been more judgmental, it would have been different, so on and so forth.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.440
[Amit Varma]: So you know, I'd like you to elaborate on that a little bit, that, you know, in what

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.600
[Amit Varma]: ways do you think with the passage of time, you know, have you changed as a person and

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:55.080
[Amit Varma]: what role has sort of this book or just the passage of time as it were played on that?

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:02.520
[Guest]: Well, yes, look, if you look at my first book, Not Quite Cricket, which had to do with my

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.640
[Guest]: experiences as a cricket reporter with what I saw regarding match fixing, and it's again

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.360
[Guest]: a kind of an eyewitness account and oral kind of a history.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.120
[Guest]: There is a lot of anger in that, I realized when I see that book, I realized that I come

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:26.280
[Guest]: from a point of view, which is very judgmental and which is even angry, like, look, I thought

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.120
[Guest]: the world would be like this and when I entered that world, there is so much of wrong things,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:39.840
[Guest]: so much of corruption and everyone else is to be blamed, except for me, in a way.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:54.280
[Guest]: This book came, I think, 20 years later, much older, I would think much wiser, if that's

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.440
[Guest]: the right word to use.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:06.000
[Guest]: And let me say that I, of late, a few years before even I started this project, I got

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
[Guest]: deeply involved with Buddhism.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.880
[Guest]: And that too, it just happened that one day, suddenly, I thought I'm going to die.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:30.400
[Guest]: You know, this feeling of fear, this fear struck me, I was more than 60 and I just out

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.320
[Guest]: of the blue, I became a different man, it seems like depression had gripped me.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:44.440
[Guest]: I couldn't enjoy anything and it lasted for a very, it was a brief period.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.280
[Guest]: And my daughter suggested that why don't you do some meditation and she found out there

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:55.480
[Guest]: is a Toshita center here, which is Dalai Lama run, they have various, at various places,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.520
[Guest]: they have these meditation centers.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:04.000
[Guest]: So I went there and more than meditation, which obviously has a calming influence, the

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.520
[Guest]: whole Buddhist thought of philosophy of causes and conditions and all human beings basically

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:19.440
[Guest]: want to be happy and an emptiness and that slowly changed me.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:26.240
[Guest]: That slowly made me realize that whatever one does, whatever evil or good, there are

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.600
[Guest]: reasons behind this, it's not as if a person does it, just it gets gripped by an evil thought

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.960
[Guest]: and he said, I will do this thing wrong or I'll do this right.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:42.600
[Guest]: There are conditions in which a person is born and those conditions influence him.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:48.320
[Guest]: He influences those conditions around him and that's how a human being interacts with

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.280
[Guest]: the world or the world interacts with that person.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:09:00.440
[Guest]: So that made me less and less judgmental and when I started writing this book, every time

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:07.240
[Guest]: I would sit to write, I would calm myself down with a bit of meditation and then tell

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:15.160
[Guest]: myself that, look, though it's my memoir and obviously these are my memories, they will

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:21.560
[Guest]: be colored by my judgments, but let me at least try my best not to be accusatory, not

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:28.160
[Guest]: to blame, just to see things from a distance.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:34.280
[Guest]: So I think I tried that and I don't know if I succeeded or not, but a lot of people feel

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.560
[Guest]: that yes, one of the strengths of the book is that it's not judgmental despite the fact

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.800
[Guest]: that there is so much in it, which could have been like, I could have taken a very strong

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.360
[Guest]: stance that this is wrong or this is right.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:58.400
[Guest]: So yes, it has helped me, being non-judgmental has also helped me to understand things better.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:05.080
[Guest]: I think that's been one of the major factors which in a way I have changed.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.320
[Guest]: I think I have changed a lot in the sense that I don't straight away see a person and

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.840
[Guest]: say that, oh, I don't like him, I don't like his, I may not like what he's saying, but

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:23.160
[Guest]: I try to understand why he's saying that and I, yeah, that's it, like, yes, I have changed.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:29.320
[Amit Varma]: Do you think that we sort of live in more judgmental times today?

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:34.920
[Amit Varma]: Because what I kind of see around me is that one, of course, our public discourse is much

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:41.640
[Amit Varma]: more polarized, but there is also this tendency today to automatically treat someone who disagrees

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.800
[Amit Varma]: with you as a bad person, especially when it comes to political discourse on Twitter

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.000
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.120
[Amit Varma]: The assumption is that if there is someone who disagrees with you, their character is

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.120
[Amit Varma]: bad.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.560
[Amit Varma]: Not that, you know, and part of this is, of course, what happens, you know, within the

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.960
[Amit Varma]: discourse where the incentives are like that.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:03.600
[Amit Varma]: People go online, they find their ideological tribe of choice, and then they are trying

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.440
[Amit Varma]: to raise their status within the tribe by posturing in whatever ways they do.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.620
[Amit Varma]: And one of the ways of doing that is that you, you know, you, you attack people on the

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.560
[Amit Varma]: other side, and you attack people on your own side for not being pure enough.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.560
[Amit Varma]: And you're always passing judgment.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.940
[Amit Varma]: And you're always looking at people and not arguments.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.680
[Amit Varma]: And we lose nuances here.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.080
[Amit Varma]: You know, we lose nuances, like, whenever I bring guests on the show, with every guest,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.920
[Amit Varma]: I try to first, you know, learn more about how they are as human beings.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.080
[Amit Varma]: And then we can talk about their ideas.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:40.120
[Amit Varma]: Because then I think one becomes more receptive to their ideas, that even if you disagree,

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.960
[Amit Varma]: at least you understand a little better, ki yeh yahan se aara hai, this is a place it's

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.360
[Amit Varma]: coming from.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.560
[Amit Varma]: So do you think that in modern times, the way the discourse is, that has become very

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.760
[Amit Varma]: shrill, you know, even perhaps the fan discourse around cricket, maybe, you know, that has

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.680
[Amit Varma]: become shrill, people are just shouting more.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.040
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps earlier, the times were a little gentler.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.520
[Amit Varma]: In the sense that I mean, of course, they would be gentler, because many less people

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.560
[Amit Varma]: had a voice, which is not a good thing.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.280
[Amit Varma]: It's a great thing that so many more people have a voice today.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.080
[Guest]: But is this something you've noticed?

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:20.080
[Guest]: Well, I think, A, I would say I'm not very sure how much of the social media, which obviously

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.120
[Guest]: is very divided, very shrill, very accusatory.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:31.240
[Guest]: I mean, some of the language which is used is not done like, people are threatening someone

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.640
[Guest]: who doesn't agree with their worldview.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:41.000
[Guest]: But is that social media reflective of the world we live in?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.240
[Guest]: I mean, or is that social media space limited to certain people?

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.000
[Guest]: But we think that's the world around us.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:57.280
[Guest]: A, one, because I go to play in the mornings, I go to the stadium and meet a lot of people.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:03.560
[Guest]: I don't see that world as shrill and as angry.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.440
[Guest]: I mean, I meet people, they have their point of view, I may disagree with them.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.960
[Guest]: I still find that those people are, maybe they are older people.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.120
[Guest]: Maybe my interaction with younger people is limited to social media.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.560
[Guest]: And then you have this TV.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.600
[Guest]: I mean, you watch TV news and I'm sure if you are a healthy man, you should be advised

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.120
[Guest]: not to watch it because they kind of manipulate you and they want you to get angry because

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.160
[Guest]: they want you to get involved.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:39.320
[Guest]: So this shrillness, this is obviously bound to affect more and more people.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.040
[Guest]: It is affecting more and more people.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.200
[Guest]: As I was saying that I interact with older people, say in the park or wherever I go to

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.880
[Guest]: play or my friends.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:57.880
[Guest]: But I guess it must be difficult to interact with the world which is younger, which is

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:07.040
[Guest]: more prone to formulating opinions on the basis of social media, WhatsApp groups.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:12.600
[Guest]: So that world, whether it is heading towards more and more anger, like we were just now

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:18.080
[Guest]: discussing about calmness and about non-judgmental, now this is a world where if you don't have

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.800
[Guest]: a judgment and if you don't have a judgment which is aggressive, which is like on your

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.720
[Guest]: face, which is accusatory, I don't think that person will think that I belong to this world.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.720
[Guest]: He has to.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.720
[Guest]: He has to scream.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.720
[Guest]: He has to shout.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720
[Guest]: He has to say, no, you are wrong.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720
[Guest]: I'll kill you.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.720
[Guest]: So I don't know.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.720
[Guest]: I'm not sure.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:41.000
[Guest]: But yes, from thinking from my space or from our shared space, it looks a bit scary what

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.560
[Guest]: the future could be.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.080
[Amit Varma]: No, but the question you asked is, is a really good one that is a world really like this,

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.160
[Amit Varma]: like with social media, like what I described really is a vocal minority.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.400
[Amit Varma]: I think the silent majority is not like this.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.400
[Amit Varma]: And they're the kind of people we encounter every day.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.680
[Amit Varma]: And to one extent, they are the reason they are the silent majority is the reason they're

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:06.100
[Amit Varma]: silent is that they want to avoid the shrillness and they want to avoid being attacked for

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:11.080
[Amit Varma]: saying anything at all, which is, you know, kind of what social media is like these days.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:16.800
[Amit Varma]: But moving on to more pleasant subjects from a time before this existed, you know, tell

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.800
[Amit Varma]: me about your childhood.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.560
[Amit Varma]: I loved reading your opening chapter.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.400
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, at the end of your book, you go back to the theme, but the opening chapter

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.400
[Amit Varma]: where you talk about 200 Magazine House, Karan Nagar, Srinagar, tell me a little bit about

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:34.120
[Amit Varma]: your childhood, what you remember of it, what was it like growing up?

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:39.680
[Guest]: It's difficult going back in time, I realized when I was doing the book, it's, it's, it's,

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.840
[Guest]: I mean, you have so many memories and you pick and choose and you.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:52.200
[Guest]: My childhood in Srinagar, look, I lived there for, as a child, I was there only for 5, 6,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:59.040
[Guest]: 6, 6, 7 years after that, because my father had a transferable job and not that I used

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.760
[Guest]: to go back to Srinagar, my grandparents and other relatives were there.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.000
[Guest]: So every summer we would be back in Srinagar.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.600
[Guest]: So my memories are very pleasant memories and I mean, I'm sure every child would have

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:22.640
[Guest]: similar memories of playing, of, of, of the mother, especially I was very much attached

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.120
[Guest]: to my mother.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.280
[Guest]: Most of the kids are.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.240
[Guest]: You would feel the world begins and ends there with your mother.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.440
[Guest]: If your mother is not there, the world is a fearful place.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:40.440
[Guest]: If your mother is there, it's such a peaceful and wonderful place and it's only when I look

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:47.680
[Guest]: back from, later when I look back at my childhood and realize the significance of, of people

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.920
[Guest]: who are living in places where there is, there is a conflict, although at that time that

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:59.520
[Guest]: conflict was not on surface, yet there was a society where, which was a divided society.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:06.960
[Guest]: I mean, we the Kashmiri Hindus, minorities, but well off, doing well in life, mostly in

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:14.280
[Guest]: government jobs and, and the majority Muslims, our interaction was, as I described in the

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:22.960
[Guest]: book also a little bit, limited to there being as domestic helps, not allowed in the kitchen,

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:31.680
[Guest]: as I said, because my grandparents, my grandmother and other elderly aunts were very, very conservative

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.480
[Guest]: and Muslims were not supposed to enter the kitchen.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:42.240
[Guest]: They were very particular about it and, and, and the kind of impressions it must have formed

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:51.840
[Guest]: in my mind, though I wonder why I remained the way I have, maybe because of my father,

00:17:51.840 --> 00:18:02.200
[Guest]: my mother itself, she was, she was not superstitious, she, she, she embraced others, if you, if

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.200
[Guest]: you can say that.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:10.640
[Guest]: So, I had a childhood which, I don't, it wasn't anything different from, I think, childhood

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.000
[Guest]: of most other people.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.520
[Guest]: I think where I, I had a, like most of the people have, many migrant experiences, I would

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:29.320
[Guest]: say, I mean, at 7, 8, from Srinagar to Haryana, then from there, after four or five years

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:35.680
[Guest]: to Punjab, then Punjab to, especially in North, but these were different cultures.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:45.520
[Guest]: I think that probably, I think, built a kind of a complex in me, maybe, a kind of an insecurity.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:51.320
[Guest]: I mean, you don't, if you are in a secure, like if I was at home in Srinagar with my

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:58.200
[Guest]: same language, same culture, secure environment, from there to be plucked out and put in a

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:03.960
[Guest]: place where you don't understand the language, you are a small kid, even your parents don't

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.840
[Guest]: know what's happening around.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.480
[Guest]: I mean, they, they are interacting with the world, which is a different world from their

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.720
[Guest]: own world.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.840
[Guest]: So what would a child's impressions be?

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:21.600
[Guest]: I am sure it would, it would affect his, the way he would interact with the world.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:28.360
[Guest]: I was a very reserved person, till probably in the profession, I started drinking.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.400
[Guest]: I mean, it was only when I used to drink, I would open out with people, otherwise I

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:41.280
[Guest]: would always be, and this feeling was always in me that, am I good enough to compete with

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.280
[Guest]: these people?

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:46.240
[Guest]: Am I good enough in profession?

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:55.560
[Guest]: So this migrant experience, I think I was lucky in a way, I was in a profession which

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.040
[Guest]: helped me to travel around the world.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:05.560
[Guest]: So I could see these migrant experiences across, especially Indians in West Indies, in England,

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:15.880
[Guest]: in Australia, in Pakistan, partition people, Muslims who went from here, I have an incident,

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:22.960
[Guest]: an episode there of meeting someone who had gone to Pakistan in 1947 and how miserable

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.980
[Guest]: and unhappy he had been there.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:36.120
[Guest]: So I think this whole rootlessness and this whole desire to somehow find an anchor, I

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:43.040
[Guest]: think maybe it's a human desire, maybe it's a human emotion, which it tries to sustain

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.400
[Guest]: itself that, no, there is a past which I can hold on to.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.680
[Guest]: And this kind of a struggle to hold on to a past, to find a past.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:21:02.040
[Guest]: In my travels, in my own personal experience, I think that's probably played a role in my

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.940
[Guest]: being what I am.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:14.920
[Guest]: And as I said that, had I not in the last few years been influenced by my Buddhist teachings,

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:20.920
[Guest]: in a way you can say that I have, at least at the moment, found an anchor, something

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:28.800
[Guest]: which I can hold on to and feel the world isn't all that bad a place to be in.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.740
[Amit Varma]: So many things I want to double click on here.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:37.480
[Amit Varma]: But for a moment, I'll sort of digress from the biographical path, which I want to come

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.960
[Amit Varma]: back to and talk about and ask you a larger question.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.960
[Amit Varma]: Like there's a lovely paragraph you've written about your father, Kishan Lalji, where you

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.520
[Amit Varma]: write, quote, I considered my father to be a recluse as he barely interacted with us.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.880
[Amit Varma]: But in rare moments of conviviality, he would always tell us that Gandhi and Nehru were

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.940
[Amit Varma]: leaders with great vision, who believed in religious harmony and peace, and fought for

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.640
[Amit Varma]: social justice and equality.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:08.560
[Amit Varma]: I still wonder where he and many others around him had acquired this deeply pluralistic worldview,

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.520
[Amit Varma]: living as they were in an orthodox and conservative environment, where suspicion of the other

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.160
[Amit Varma]: was cloaked in civility, and the fear of the unknown lurked in the shadows.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.160
[Amit Varma]: Stop good.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:25.200
[Amit Varma]: And this last sentence speaks so deeply to me, because one of the sort of ways in which

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.480
[Amit Varma]: a scale has sort of fallen off from my eyes, and something that I didn't see, I think I

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.200
[Amit Varma]: now see is in the fundamental nature of our society.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:40.160
[Amit Varma]: Like I grew up in a sort of elite English speaking bubble, which you know, has a broadly

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.720
[Amit Varma]: pluralistic secular view of the world.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.760
[Amit Varma]: And you imagine India is like that.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.320
[Amit Varma]: And to some extent, yeah, India, we've assimilated everything, we are a delightful khichri of

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.560
[Amit Varma]: cultures and languages and all that.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.160
[Amit Varma]: So at one level, yeah.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.720
[Amit Varma]: But at another level, the divisions that we see in our society today, the bigotry and

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:02.520
[Amit Varma]: the sexism that we see in our society today, the casteism has always been there, and has

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.840
[Amit Varma]: been extremely deep rooted, like I did an episode with Akshay Mukul, who wrote this

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.920
[Amit Varma]: great book on the Gita Press, which sort of reveals that our society has always been like

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.920
[Amit Varma]: this.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:18.240
[Amit Varma]: But it's always been lurking below the surface in the words that you used here, cloaked in

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.320
[Amit Varma]: civility, right?

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:27.780
[Amit Varma]: And what so what has happened now is not that a toxic politics has created a toxic populace,

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.880
[Amit Varma]: but rather it's the other way around that your toxic politics is supply responding to

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.600
[Amit Varma]: demand and our society has always been like this.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.420
[Amit Varma]: And now it has finally found expression.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.000
[Amit Varma]: What are your thoughts on this?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.960
[Amit Varma]: Like, has our society always been like this, where people like your father and yourself,

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:50.360
[Amit Varma]: were we the exceptions always were we the outliers, or, you know, are there ebbs and

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.160
[Amit Varma]: flows and this is just how it is?

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.160
[Amit Varma]: What are your thoughts?

00:23:53.160 --> 00:24:03.080
[Guest]: Well, I think it's a it's quite a complex question and and my response, probably maybe

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.480
[Guest]: also complex.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:13.520
[Guest]: I mean, in a way, yes, my experiences with my relatives, with the people I have grown

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:22.200
[Guest]: up with, has been that they beneath the surface have always been deeply conservative and what

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:28.560
[Guest]: has been unleashed now in public was their worldview right from the beginning.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:39.000
[Guest]: It's only that the political environment was not encouraging for them to come out openly

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.320
[Guest]: and say that yes, they believe in their superiority of their religion.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:50.280
[Guest]: That's also okay, even if you think your religion is very superior, but the belief that the

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:57.320
[Guest]: other religions are inferior and it's my religion is the only religion which can teach civility

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.320
[Guest]: to people.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.840
[Guest]: So, it was there.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:05.600
[Guest]: I've seen that in my childhood, one of the memories I describe in the book is of one

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:13.600
[Guest]: of my uncles getting furious at that one Hindu girl has married a Muslim or there is a dispute

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:21.800
[Guest]: that has she married or was she abducted or was she or did she elope and the kind of anger

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.760
[Guest]: which was on display even as a child, I still some of that memory has remained in my mind

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:34.200
[Guest]: that anger that that image of my uncle getting so furious and angry.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:43.280
[Guest]: See, I also have had unlike a lot of my friends, later friends who have as you say that we

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:49.840
[Guest]: so called liberals have been educated in public schools and I had this mix.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:57.920
[Guest]: I had a one year in a public school in Srinagar, then I Yamunanagar, Panipat, this whole absence

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.320
[Guest]: of proper public schools.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:04.160
[Guest]: I would probably have also had the same experience, but I think I'm lucky that I didn't have that

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.160
[Guest]: experience.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:13.720
[Guest]: I had my schooling in Panipat in a pure Hindi medium school, which was steeped in the very

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:20.880
[Guest]: conservative Indian traditions with all class consciousness being there as I do describe

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.760
[Guest]: that in the book.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:32.360
[Guest]: So those experiences of mine, I mean, I probably must have been soaking in a world which wasn't

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.360
[Guest]: as liberal as a lot of my friends later would.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.840
[Guest]: I mean, I remember till a long period of time, the reference points of my friends who were

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.720
[Guest]: public school educated were very different from my reference points.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:52.280
[Guest]: I mean, I wasn't schooled in or I wasn't taught about the Western music.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.680
[Guest]: I wasn't aware of what it is all about.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:27:00.560
[Guest]: And I suddenly I would see my friends singing those songs or talking about them and I would

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:09.280
[Guest]: feel this inferiority complex that look, I'm not and my mother was deeply involved with

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:15.440
[Guest]: watching films like every Indian is and she was deeply immersed in listening to Hindi

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:20.080
[Guest]: film music like most of the Indian families are.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.560
[Guest]: I still retain that my love for old film songs.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:30.720
[Guest]: In fact, I have this, one of my greatest strengths is that I tell people that play any song from

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:37.440
[Guest]: 50s, 60s, 70s and the moment you put on that song, the music, within one second I'll tell

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.480
[Guest]: you which that song is.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.880
[Guest]: So this is how like we have grown, I have grown.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.360
[Guest]: These probably were my reference points.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:56.680
[Guest]: So your question that we were always a very conservative society, I think we were always

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:06.560
[Guest]: a society which took pride in their own religion and look as a kid, I never knew that there

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:12.280
[Guest]: are caste divisions, like the school or even at home.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.440
[Guest]: If there was a caste talk, it was always in a very derogatory sense that these people

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:23.240
[Guest]: were like the chuda or the cleaner in the house.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.520
[Guest]: So this is how you grow, you're never taught in school that all these things, why, from

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.520
[Guest]: where they came, how wrong were they, it's only later my own education.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:40.520
[Guest]: I think in the book, I tried my best to be true to what I was whenever I was there, because

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:48.280
[Guest]: I took a very conscious decision to try my best to tell a story of a middle class boy

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:54.000
[Guest]: who is not even aware of, I mean, what is it my fault that I'm being made aware of things

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.900
[Guest]: as a lived experience and I have to connect, I have to find out why, why is it so.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:06.480
[Guest]: So yes, I think with the political environment of today is such that it has encouraged people

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:13.080
[Guest]: to unleash all those beliefs they had, which we thought we didn't have.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:19.720
[Guest]: So it's all in the open now, I'm sure if in the late 50s, early 60s, I was in Srinagar,

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:24.800
[Guest]: if there was a state which was radically right wing, I'm sure they would have been openly

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.480
[Guest]: talking about all those things.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:34.560
[Amit Varma]: I was very struck by this one story from your time in Panipat, where you speak about your

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560
[Amit Varma]: friends.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:40.120
[Amit Varma]: And of course, your classmate was Shekhar Gupta and, you know, and he reappears at different

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.720
[Amit Varma]: points through the book and plays a part in your life.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.680
[Amit Varma]: But I was struck by another classmate you mentioned, someone called Suraj.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.080
[Amit Varma]: And you said that Suraj used to come to the school in kurta pajama.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.440
[Amit Varma]: And then one day he stopped coming.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.320
[Amit Varma]: And nobody knew where he had gone.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.440
[Amit Varma]: And one day when you were on the road, you saw him as part of a wedding band and he's

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.160
[Amit Varma]: marching along with it.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.920
[Amit Varma]: And you called out to him and he completely ignored you.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:08.200
[Amit Varma]: And the fact that you remember this is to me something, you know, obviously, the story

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.520
[Amit Varma]: struck you and stayed with you.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:18.160
[Amit Varma]: And when I look back on my life, I try to sort of identify the many layers of unseeing

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.320
[Amit Varma]: as it were, which gradually kind of fall, you know, you grow up in a certain way, you

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:27.920
[Amit Varma]: might not be aware of, say, how class functions or how caste functions or, you know, how gender

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.960
[Amit Varma]: functions and gradually those layers slip away and you sort of realize you see something

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.720
[Amit Varma]: you never saw before, even though it was in front of you.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.600
[Amit Varma]: So were there moments like that for you?

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:43.760
[Amit Varma]: Like it seems to me that at some visceral, instinctive level, this story must have affected

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:47.320
[Amit Varma]: you a lot that 50 years later, you're telling the story, right?

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:53.160
[Amit Varma]: So what were and again, when you speak about in Srinagar, how the Muslims were treated

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.640
[Amit Varma]: and if they touched a vessel, it would be washed and it was almost like they were a

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.200
[Amit Varma]: lower caste as it were.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, this is something I'm assuming that you're looking back and in hindsight, you are beginning

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.400
[Amit Varma]: to see what was happening.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.240
[Amit Varma]: And at the time, obviously, you would have been too small.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:11.960
[Amit Varma]: So through your life, what are the different kind of layers that have fallen away like

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.860
[Amit Varma]: this, if you can put a sort of a finger on those?

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.680
[Guest]: You mean, which have deeply influenced me?

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.640
[Amit Varma]: Which have influenced you or where you just felt that you began to see something differently,

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, so you might go to school and all the boys are just boys, they're all just your

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.280
[Amit Varma]: classmates.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.760
[Amit Varma]: But with the Suraj incident, he leaves and you see him playing in a wedding band.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:39.400
[Amit Varma]: It's like it does the story just underscores that no, these are not all just classmates.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.440
[Amit Varma]: There are so many other things going on here, which are so poignant and so sort of tragic.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:50.680
[Guest]: See, I think it is my father, despite the fact that we didn't have a very, I mean, it

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:54.040
[Guest]: was not there was a relationship wasn't bad.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:58.600
[Guest]: But in the sense that, you know, that that period, the father was supposed to like come

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.280
[Guest]: back tired and don't don't disturb him.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:07.120
[Guest]: And no, it wasn't like what you see today, or what must have been at that time also with

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.680
[Guest]: a lot of other kids.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:16.000
[Guest]: It was neither bad, neither was it very like, you know, like you full of warmth or my mother,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.880
[Guest]: but my father was a very deeply pluralistic person and he was deeply involved with talking

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.880
[Guest]: on politics.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.280
[Guest]: So, I would listen when even when he was to interact with other people, he used to have

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:32.680
[Guest]: a lot of arguments with his own relatives on this.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:41.460
[Guest]: So I probably it seeped into my mind, it subconsciously, I got influenced.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:49.560
[Guest]: My mother, as I said, was, despite being, I mean, she wouldn't eat outside any non-veg,

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:56.720
[Guest]: she was a non-vegetarian like majority of Kashmiri Hindus are, Brahmins are.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.760
[Guest]: But she wouldn't eat outside because she would think it's beef.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:05.760
[Guest]: She had this, I have this story in the book where we visit a Muslim family much later

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:11.520
[Guest]: in life and they serve us kebabs and she's reluctant to eat because she thinks it will

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:18.840
[Guest]: be beef and that friend of ours, my brother's friend, convinces, the family convinces that

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.880
[Guest]: it's not beef, it's mutton.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:26.640
[Guest]: So those things must have influenced me.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:32.600
[Guest]: I think the Suraj incident, I think Mandal influenced me very deeply in this.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:39.360
[Guest]: I remember, I have in the book itself, there is this character, my friend, Jatinder Chadha,

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:45.840
[Guest]: who is at the other extreme spectrum of, he's not today, but at that time he was.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.840
[Amit Varma]: RSS supporter.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.080
[Guest]: Yeah, he was an RSS supporter, he used to drink with him, used to have a lot of debates

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.480
[Guest]: with him.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:58.840
[Guest]: And that was a period when I was used to debate with him, the whole caste structure and, you

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:05.840
[Guest]: know, you wonder why are people, I mean, it's not my fault if I am born in a privileged

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.160
[Guest]: family, anyone's fault.

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:16.080
[Guest]: Similarly, if you are born in a lower caste or a poor family, do you blame that person

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.080
[Guest]: for that?

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.920
[Guest]: It's not his fault or her fault.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:25.520
[Guest]: But this disparity, this disparity, now, whether it is, why is it so?

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.320
[Guest]: We all grapple with this question.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:34.680
[Guest]: We try to find an answer that what is the reason behind this disparity at birth?

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:39.560
[Guest]: Forget that you transcend that and you work hard or whatever, you're lucky.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:44.840
[Guest]: But there are, in India, there are more percentage of people whom you say it's bad luck that

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.680
[Guest]: they are born in those environments.

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:52.920
[Guest]: So is it bad luck, is it to do with karma, is it to do with, what is it to do with?

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:58.840
[Guest]: So we used to have these massive debates while drinking that why is the society the way it

00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.840
[Guest]: is?

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:09.280
[Guest]: And somehow the conclusion used to be that it's possible that their karmic past may have

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.280
[Guest]: been bad.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.280
[Guest]: So they were born there.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:18.600
[Guest]: So I would, maybe I was not convinced that this is like the way it is, but I was not

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.040
[Guest]: deeply questioning it also.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:30.880
[Guest]: When Mandal happened and it's the reaction of my people, my friends, surrounding neighbors,

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:37.520
[Guest]: relatives, the way it surfaced, it took me by great surprise, it shook me to see that

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:43.480
[Guest]: they had so much of disdain for people who were poor.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:49.720
[Guest]: And that is where I think Suraj, that memory may have got even more deepened in my mind.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:57.040
[Guest]: See I was there, this Suraj was a protector in the school because even though people in

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:04.880
[Guest]: school would see me as a very fair, as I say, chikna, like this upper class guy who is in

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:10.600
[Guest]: a school with students who don't belong to maybe that class, a lot of them.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:17.680
[Guest]: So they would take pleasure in, sadistic pleasure in troubling me.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:24.960
[Guest]: And this helpless poor boy, as I was, and then found a protector in Suraj, who would

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:32.120
[Guest]: like tell these guys to get lost and because of him, I could be in peace at school.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:37.960
[Guest]: So now this guy vanishes and I have lost my protector and then I see him and the very

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:42.880
[Guest]: fact that he's playing a band was a shock to me at that age.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.040
[Guest]: And then he refuses to recognize me.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:54.560
[Guest]: I go towards him with so much of warmth and so much of feeling of gratitude or happiness

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.400
[Guest]: that I have finally seen him where he is and I want to know, where have you vanished?

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:05.720
[Guest]: And he just treats me with almost in a way with contempt that I don't recognize you.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:13.940
[Guest]: So when Mandal happened and this connection in the book, it had happened while I was writing

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.560
[Guest]: about Suraj.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:24.160
[Guest]: I had this Mandal and I, in fact, it happened that I somehow realized that I was living

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.600
[Guest]: in a world which my people were not telling me the real story.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.920
[Guest]: I realized that there is a deep in-built exploitation in this caste structure.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.840
[Guest]: Okay, you're born poor, but that doesn't mean that you should not be given self-respect

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.400
[Guest]: and dignity, which I realized that we lack that.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.120
[Guest]: We lack that sensitivity.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.640
[Guest]: It made a major impact on me.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:54.840
[Guest]: I started re-looking at a lot of things, re-looking at caste, re-looking at Ambedkar, re-looking

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.240
[Guest]: at Gandhi itself.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:05.200
[Guest]: So that and then Babri Majjid demolition also, I mean, all these things were running parallel

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:14.960
[Guest]: to each other and since my being from Kashmir and my own relatives having had to flee that

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:22.840
[Guest]: place and so all this was playing in my mind and I sort of realized that instead of coming

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:26.960
[Guest]: from a pulpit and saying that, look, we are being wronged, I realized that there were

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.920
[Guest]: a lot of wrongs which we ourselves had committed.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:38.720
[Guest]: So, why be so judgmental and so feel superior?

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:46.240
[Guest]: I started introspecting and then I was living in this period of terrorism in Punjab.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.240
[Guest]: I had Sikh friends.

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:51.080
[Guest]: I had some very close couple of Sikh friends.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:58.400
[Guest]: One was Randhir, who wasn't interested in the entire politics of what was happening,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:04.520
[Guest]: but I had another friend, Dhaliwal, who was a very keen political animal and he would

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:09.480
[Guest]: tell me about exploitation by Brahmins, exploitation by Baniyas.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:14.680
[Guest]: I would not like it because I was in that period of time.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:23.400
[Guest]: I was in myself in a flux, what is right, what is wrong, but Mrs. Gandhi's assassination,

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:31.080
[Guest]: the reaction to it, Operation Blue Star, I think all those factors changed me completely.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:36.160
[Guest]: I mean, I started forming a worldview which I didn't have at that time.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:41.640
[Guest]: My worldview was like whatever my majority around me used to tell me.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:52.000
[Guest]: These things made a deep impression on me and it was, I was 40 when I had almost formulated

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.280
[Guest]: my worldview.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:40:05.320
[Guest]: I came to Delhi, to a bigger city, more insecure, insular city than wherever I had lived earlier.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:15.480
[Amit Varma]: So before we started recording, we were sort of chatting about how opinions and worldviews

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.000
[Amit Varma]: get formed today.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.520
[Amit Varma]: Like one experiment, which listeners will be familiar with, I tried a couple of years

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:26.160
[Amit Varma]: back was I wanted to sort of delve into the extreme side of the Hindu right wing to see

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.400
[Amit Varma]: what they're up to.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:34.080
[Amit Varma]: So I opened up, but I didn't want my social media algorithms to get affected by my searches.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.480
[Amit Varma]: So I opened up YouTube in an incognito window and discovered people like Yati Narsinanand

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.640
[Amit Varma]: and all that, all these toxic folks well before, you know, they were in the news in the way

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.080
[Amit Varma]: that they are today.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:48.600
[Amit Varma]: And over time, therefore, what happened was, and because I was doing that under another

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:53.600
[Amit Varma]: Google account and incognito windows, so completely different, is that I found that I had two

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.600
[Amit Varma]: YouTubes.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.640
[Amit Varma]: And one is a regular YouTube, which is me, all the things I'm interested in, the chess

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.120
[Amit Varma]: and the music and whatever reflects who I am.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.000
[Amit Varma]: And the other one is completely different and is so completely different that there's

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
[Amit Varma]: no relation between the two.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.280
[Amit Varma]: And it also therefore strikes me that how does a worldview get formed?

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.800
[Amit Varma]: If you're 15 years old today, and your friend sends you a video, and the video is about

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:18.680
[Amit Varma]: Oh, look, the Muslims are doing this, or this is happening, and so on and so forth, one

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:23.560
[Amit Varma]: of those videos, then your algorithms will pump out more of the same.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:28.800
[Amit Varma]: And they pump out more of the same to the extent that your entire world is so dominated

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:34.400
[Amit Varma]: by the worldview, that it seems a complete aberration that anything else exists or that

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.960
[Amit Varma]: any other way of thinking is reasonable.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:41.840
[Amit Varma]: So you automatically then begin to believe that anyone who disagrees with you is evil

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.680
[Amit Varma]: or they under the pay of someone or their foreign agents and all of that nonsense.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.160
[Amit Varma]: And it is not the fault of the person.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.360
[Amit Varma]: It's just the way the world is.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:56.680
[Amit Varma]: And I was struck by again, a beautiful self reflective passage in your book, where you

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:01.560
[Amit Varma]: talk about how when you were young, you could also get carried away by jingoism and this

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.560
[Amit Varma]: and that.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.880
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, you write, quote, I am not sure whether I really believe this in my heart,

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.760
[Amit Varma]: or all this aggressive talk was just an outpouring of my own insecurities and frustrations as

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:17.040
[Amit Varma]: a middle class youth, aspiring to a life of comfort and security, as led by some of my

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.640
[Amit Varma]: friends who belong to well off business families, while it was possible that this insecurity

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.840
[Amit Varma]: could have influenced my ideas.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:28.680
[Amit Varma]: It was also true that my wealthier friend said even more militant, aggressive and xenophobic

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.180
[Amit Varma]: mindsets than I did, stop good.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.480
[Amit Varma]: So now, this self reflection, of course, is coming later.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.560
[Amit Varma]: But what has also happened is that you didn't remain like that.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, there is a josh of youth where you are proud to be part of a tribe and you're

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:47.700
[Amit Varma]: aggressive and all of that, and then that dissipates and then you become who you are.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.800
[Amit Varma]: But many people for many people, it doesn't dissipate, it remains it remains it gets solidified,

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, like your friend, Jatinder Chadha, you mentioned, who, you know, kind of stayed

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.720
[Amit Varma]: in that space.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:03.240
[Amit Varma]: So just sort of looking back through your life, the people you have known, and so on

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.300
[Amit Varma]: and so forth.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.920
[Amit Varma]: Is it the outliers who change?

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.920
[Amit Varma]: Is it the outliers who can do the self reflection?

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:15.760
[Amit Varma]: Who can, who can allow something like Mandal to remind them of a friend from 20 years ago

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.840
[Amit Varma]: in school?

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:22.400
[Amit Varma]: Is it the outliers who change and, and and if not, if it is possible that many people

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:27.480
[Amit Varma]: can change these early views and come out of it and look at the world differently in

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.840
[Amit Varma]: a more tolerant, liberal way?

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.800
[Amit Varma]: What can cause that to happen?

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:39.520
[Guest]: Well, it's it's quite a scary thought that if if the generation which is today living

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:46.720
[Guest]: the if I go back and there was no social media, there was just interaction, there were reflections

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.960
[Guest]: because you had space and time for reflection also, which is no longer here.

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.360
[Guest]: Everyone is busy, even I am busy with my mobile all the time.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:44:00.600
[Guest]: And I tell myself that what am I doing like, my mind is being all the time being controlled

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:07.080
[Guest]: and I'm much older, like we are older and yet we fall into this trap with younger people.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:13.960
[Guest]: That's the way they have seen the world that they are living a life, which is there existing

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:14.960
[Guest]: already.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.740
[Guest]: It's not as if they have created this world.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:26.400
[Guest]: So this technology, as one of my friends tells me, has hacked, see the the minds of younger

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:32.840
[Guest]: people or all people have been hacked already by this technology, by the use of this technology.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.400
[Guest]: If the mind has already been hacked, so what is left there?

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:44.120
[Guest]: You are no longer thinking or doing something with the reflection, with a pause, with and

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.960
[Guest]: I think the biggest loss.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:55.880
[Guest]: I remember I had gone to Calcutta for my book release and there we met, there were a couple

00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:01.720
[Guest]: of sessions on Satyajit Ray and this great actor, Dhritaman Chatterjee, he was doing

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.440
[Guest]: one session.

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:10.800
[Guest]: And then after the session, there was a get together where we started talking and we start

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:17.200
[Guest]: talking about Ray and then this discussion about whether Ray is a filmmaker because there

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:23.480
[Guest]: is a lot of criticism about Ray is that he was not a political animal like Hrithik Ghatak

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:31.960
[Guest]: or Mrinal Sen or his films kind of avoided getting into these real serious subaltern

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:32.960
[Guest]: issues.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:39.720
[Guest]: So, Dhritaman Chatterjee said something which just stayed with me after that, not in that

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.360
[Guest]: context but in the context of your question as well.

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.800
[Guest]: He said that look, Ray of course was an elite.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:54.080
[Guest]: He was an elite and a lot of the subaltern things he couldn't understand also.

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:59.600
[Guest]: But what rescued him was empathy.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:06.200
[Guest]: I mean that was a wonderful summation of, I think, not just Ray, but what can rescue

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.200
[Guest]: us?

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:12.680
[Guest]: We see so much of wrong things happening around us.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.680
[Guest]: Should our reaction be to act the same manner?

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:21.960
[Guest]: Unless we have empathy, unless we, we need to be rescued by empathy.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:28.400
[Guest]: I think this present civilization or India, it can only be rescued by empathy.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.040
[Guest]: But where will that empathy come from?

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:40.240
[Guest]: It will come from, I think, some kind of reflection, maybe a miracle one would hope.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:47.960
[Guest]: But unless a society or a community or a religion does not have that empathy, that compassion,

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:55.560
[Guest]: that sensitivity, it will be difficult for those people to live in peace because they

00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:02.200
[Guest]: will be always in rage, always in anger, always in a mood to take revenge.

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:07.440
[Guest]: And finally, when you take revenge, when you live with those emotions, whom are you harming?

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:11.420
[Guest]: You may be harming the person whom you are attacking, but in the end, you are harming

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:15.080
[Guest]: yourself as well.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.920
[Amit Varma]: So I'm actually a big fan of Satyajit Ray and I don't agree with that criticism.

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:24.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if you look at films like Prothi Dwandi or Seema Baudho and I think they are politically

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.120
[Guest]: very...

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:31.920
[Guest]: I discovered that after that I saw those films again and even Agantok, they are all deeply

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.200
[Guest]: political films.

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:42.000
[Guest]: And his Gare Bare is a deeply anti-right film, I discovered and I said that, no, maybe it

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.360
[Guest]: is not just his empathy, maybe he was as well involved with these issues.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:52.400
[Guest]: But only thing is, being the great master he was, he wasn't overstated, he was understated.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it was subtle, it wasn't overt, but through the human stories of the people in

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.000
[Amit Varma]: his films, it kind of came out.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.440
[Amit Varma]: Taking off from this point about empathy, which is a beautiful and very deep point,

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.880
[Amit Varma]: so thank you for that story.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Another theme that I've been thinking about and I sometimes discuss with my guests on

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.280
[Amit Varma]: the show is of the difference between the concrete and the abstract.

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:19.380
[Amit Varma]: And Anshul Malhotra, who wrote this beautiful book on partition, when she did an episode

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:25.560
[Amit Varma]: with me, spoke about how once she was, you know, while interviewing people for a book,

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:31.240
[Amit Varma]: she was sitting with a family in Pakistan who had come across during partition and obviously

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:35.160
[Amit Varma]: they were, you know, raging against what the Hindus had done and the Hindus are like this

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.680
[Amit Varma]: and the Hindus are like that.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.400
[Amit Varma]: And at one point they noticed that she's sitting there and they said, tum nahi beti, tum nahi,

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.560
[Amit Varma]: tum toh theek ho.

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:46.560
[Amit Varma]: And to me, this is the difference between the abstract and the concrete, that I think

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:52.440
[Amit Varma]: that many of the things that make us hateful are abstract concepts like nationalism and

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.440
[Amit Varma]: purity and race and all of these things.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.840
[Amit Varma]: But in the concrete, when you encounter another human being, sometimes your instincts are

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:07.280
[Amit Varma]: not quite like that, you know, sometimes then you see the humanity in them, you know, you

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:11.520
[Amit Varma]: so it's, it's, you know, a lot of bigots will say, oh, but I have Muslim friends, right?

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.180
[Amit Varma]: It's become a cliche and a joke.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:16.600
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is that they might actually be right, they do have Muslim friends who

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.960
[Amit Varma]: they consider friends, but that's a concrete.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:24.560
[Amit Varma]: But in the abstract, they are full of hate and abstractions scale faster than the concrete

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:29.200
[Amit Varma]: and where empathy comes from, the point that you bring about is the concrete.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:33.600
[Amit Varma]: I can feel empathetic for something that is in front of me in flesh and blood.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:40.240
[Amit Varma]: I can't feel empathetic at a conceptual level for a people or whatever, you know, so if

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.920
[Amit Varma]: you demonize a particular set of people as the other, it's hard to be empathetic in the

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:49.880
[Amit Varma]: abstract sense, but you're in front of me and I can be empathetic because I see that

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:54.960
[Amit Varma]: you're like me with my insecurities and fears and, you know, some amount of shared journey

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.000
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, and that possibility exists.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.960
[Amit Varma]: So I just feel that for empathy to take place, there has to be more of the concrete.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:09.000
[Amit Varma]: And unfortunately, like you pointed out, we are actually all the time staring into our

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.960
[Amit Varma]: smartphones, you know, you go into a cafe today.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.480
[Amit Varma]: If you sit alone, and you're just looking around, you're like a sociopath.

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:19.840
[Amit Varma]: Nobody does that, right?

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.720
[Amit Varma]: Everybody's looking into their smartphone.

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:26.240
[Amit Varma]: They're not looking at the flesh and blood people around them who are, and everybody's

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.560
[Amit Varma]: so fascinating.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.120
[Amit Varma]: Everybody has a story, you can learn something from everyone, you can find warmth and comfort

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.120
[Amit Varma]: in everyone.

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:36.080
[Amit Varma]: But we are looking into our smartphones, leaving the concrete for the abstract.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.800
[Amit Varma]: So I mean, I'm just responding, there's not really a question in this, I was just sort

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.800
[Guest]: of...

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.480
[Guest]: No, I agree with you completely.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.800
[Guest]: Because even I have had these experiences.

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:51.160
[Guest]: There was a time in Delhi, when one of my friends, Vivek Raina, who is in the book also,

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:57.240
[Guest]: he had, he and another Muslim friend of his that started this group called, like, let

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.320
[Guest]: everyone, let us be inclusive and be together.

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:10.520
[Guest]: It's a line from her poem, like, let everyone sleep in the same quilt and pull the rope

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.520
[Guest]: in the same direction.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:19.640
[Guest]: So they'd started this group in which Muslims and Kashmiri Hindus would interact and went

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.280
[Guest]: there, even anger.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:27.320
[Guest]: One of, they had a meeting in Delhi where physically all of us went, I also went.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:32.680
[Guest]: And there was this young Muslim who was angry, he said that, I've been told at home that

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:38.720
[Guest]: Hindus are like, what you were saying, same kind of a tone and tenor of the Hindus, they've

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.400
[Guest]: done this to us, and they are bad and this thing.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:46.360
[Guest]: And then when my turn came to speak, I made an emotional speech.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:53.400
[Guest]: So after that, he came to me and saying that, you are different, like, you're different.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:59.400
[Guest]: And I tried to explain to him that it's not I am different, it's like you haven't interacted

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:05.600
[Guest]: physically with the other side, because most of the Muslims in Kashmir Valley haven't interacted

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:12.880
[Guest]: with their Kashmiri Hindus, because 90% of them left that place, or 95%.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:19.920
[Guest]: So yes, this abstract world and the concrete world, and right now the tragedy is we are

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:26.080
[Guest]: living in the more and more in abstract world, there is no concrete world around us.

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:33.720
[Guest]: So unless people who are hacking this mind realize the dangers of hacking a mind and

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:42.880
[Guest]: what can it result in, unless they realize, I think we are facing scary times.

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:47.880
[Amit Varma]: So you know, I'll just go on a little sort of rant about the hacking the mind sort of

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:48.880
[Amit Varma]: point.

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:51.640
[Amit Varma]: So I was a professional poker player for about five years.

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.560
[Amit Varma]: And it's of course a game of skill, but it's the only game of skill you'll play inside

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.560
[Amit Varma]: a casino.

00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.720
[Amit Varma]: And of course, you're not playing against the house, you're playing against other players.

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:04.380
[Amit Varma]: But every other game in a casino is obviously, you know, a losing proposition for the players.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.600
[Amit Varma]: And I read this very interesting book, I've forgotten the name, I'll link it from the

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:13.480
[Amit Varma]: show notes about how casinos historically have been hacking the mind, so to say how

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:19.800
[Amit Varma]: they have been sort of manipulating their users in such a way that they can direct behavior.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:23.440
[Amit Varma]: So for example, way before the age of the internet or whatever, you know, you'll have

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.440
[Amit Varma]: a slot machine, a person is sitting on it and all of that.

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:31.360
[Amit Varma]: So one, all the lights and the sounds and everything that happens is meant to just lull

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:35.760
[Amit Varma]: you into the state of near hypnosis, where you're just sitting, you can't take action,

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:40.640
[Amit Varma]: you just keep playing to from the pattern of your play, they have a way of figuring

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.900
[Amit Varma]: out that this person is about to get up in the next 10 minutes.

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:47.880
[Amit Varma]: So whenever they figure this out, there'll be an alarm that rings in whatever the control

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.400
[Amit Varma]: room is, and somebody will go down from there to this player.

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.280
[Amit Varma]: And they will say, Sir, you've been playing for so long, we'd like to reward you with

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:57.020
[Amit Varma]: a free drink and some free snacks, and they put it there.

00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.160
[Amit Varma]: And the guy continues playing, right?

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:03.900
[Amit Varma]: So everything that therefore you use, the gambling industry really nailed it because

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:07.040
[Amit Varma]: they have the best incentives to control human behavior.

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:11.120
[Amit Varma]: Now what's happened in modern times is that hacking the mind is a perfect phrase, but

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:16.240
[Amit Varma]: it also can lead to a misunderstanding where people think that there is directionality

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:21.600
[Amit Varma]: that somebody, some evil force is trying to manipulate us and hack the mind.

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.800
[Amit Varma]: And actually, that's not always the case.

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.400
[Amit Varma]: What social media sites and platforms want to do is maximize engagement.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:31.280
[Amit Varma]: The longer you spend there, you know, the more data they have on you, and the more ads

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.400
[Amit Varma]: they can serve you, and so on and so forth.

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.800
[Amit Varma]: So they maximize engagement.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:41.760
[Amit Varma]: Now a result of maximizing engagement, an unpleasant side effect is that you get served

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:45.760
[Amit Varma]: more and more of the same content that you kind of want to like in the case of that 15

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:50.240
[Amit Varma]: year old kid, you send him one Hindutva video, and that's, you know, going to be the majority

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.500
[Amit Varma]: of what he gets.

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.360
[Amit Varma]: So the problem here isn't a problem of evil.

00:54:54.360 --> 00:55:00.280
[Amit Varma]: The problem here is a problem of an unintended consequence that some site has maximized engagement,

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.240
[Amit Varma]: which is after all what they are rationally going to do.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:08.320
[Amit Varma]: But the result of that is that we are having a divided and polarized society and all these

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.440
[Amit Varma]: other things are happening.

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.960
[Amit Varma]: That's one of the unpleasant consequences.

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.000
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, it's just a mini rant that you know, because hacking the mind, you can think that

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:24.320
[Amit Varma]: oh, there is BJP is hacking your mind or nobody will hack your mind, even everybody will hear

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:30.040
[Guest]: I think when it gets mixed up with with business, it becomes even a greater deadly cocktail

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:37.400
[Guest]: because because they they know that this man or this woman is looking at these videos.

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:41.480
[Guest]: So they want to hold your attention on to they'll feed you that and if I am looking

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:46.000
[Guest]: at completely different kind of write ups of videos, they'll provide me that because

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.240
[Guest]: they want to retain that attention.

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.840
[Guest]: And now in retaining that attention, they are not bothered about how it's affecting

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:58.240
[Guest]: me or you or so that that becomes even even more dangerous.

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:02.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I mean, we're talking in a time where this is an open question, you know,

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.440
[Amit Varma]: 10 years later, maybe is resolved.

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:09.140
[Amit Varma]: And maybe it's just this point in time where it's a problem because I get deep unease when

00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:14.240
[Amit Varma]: people talk about the state regulating social media, because my sense is that the state

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:18.000
[Amit Varma]: is now going to regulate and decide what goes and what doesn't go.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.080
[Amit Varma]: I feel that that can lead to really suboptimal solutions like big because the state is what

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.520
[Amit Varma]: it is, right.

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:28.720
[Amit Varma]: But you know, what are the incentives for social media platforms to do this themselves

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.240
[Amit Varma]: is an interesting question.

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:35.360
[Amit Varma]: And I see that people in social media platforms do think about this stuff, you know, so like,

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:39.800
[Amit Varma]: for example, on Twitter, sometimes, you know, I wrote a piece once and somebody tweeted

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:40.800
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:41.800
[Amit Varma]: So I was just clicking on the retweet.

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.720
[Amit Varma]: And the question came up that, do you want to read this first before you retweet it?

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:46.720
[Amit Varma]: Right?

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:49.760
[Guest]: So it is noticing that you haven't read it, but you just saw the headline, do you want

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:53.360
[Amit Varma]: to read it first, which I think is a great initiative, which Twitter does.

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.920
[Amit Varma]: And you know, Facebook does kind of similar things, WhatsApp will tell you that this message

00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.900
[Amit Varma]: has been forwarded many times.

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:03.960
[Amit Varma]: So you kind of get a sense of that it's something that is being propagated.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:08.960
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, it's it's sort of very much a sort of open question.

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:13.760
[Amit Varma]: Another theme that I want to sort of double click on, which you mentioned earlier, is

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:20.320
[Amit Varma]: your experience, in a sense as a migrant that as a child, you go to Panipat, then from you

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.520
[Amit Varma]: know, and Haryana culture is like I was born and brought up in Chandigarh.

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:27.920
[Amit Varma]: So I have a little sense of that in Haryana culture is a whole different thing.

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.320
[Amit Varma]: And then you go to Amritsar, and you know, Sikhs all around you.

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.400
[Amit Varma]: And that's a whole different thing.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:39.080
[Amit Varma]: And then you come to Chandigarh, where you spend a while, and then eventually, Delhi,

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.680
[Amit Varma]: and then of course, you're traveling the world.

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:44.360
[Amit Varma]: So you're exposed to all these different cultures, including Pakistan.

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:51.800
[Amit Varma]: So you know, do you feel that that experience of migrating and seeing different cultures,

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:55.620
[Amit Varma]: different kinds of people, has the effect of taking a person out of their shell and

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:59.580
[Amit Varma]: out of any bubble that may be forming around them, and broaden their worldview?

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:01.800
[Amit Varma]: Or is it only in your case that it happened?

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.320
[Amit Varma]: And I might be overthinking it by just asking the question.

00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:12.440
[Guest]: Well, I was about to say that, in my case, yes, I am thankful and grateful to my circumstances

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:20.080
[Guest]: and I could see the world, literally see the world without spending my own money.

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:24.480
[Guest]: Cricket helped me to travel the world and travel across India as well.

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.560
[Guest]: It opened my mind.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:30.220
[Guest]: It's like you are in a frog in a well, they say.

00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:31.480
[Guest]: So I was a frog in a well.

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:38.320
[Guest]: If I had stayed in Srinagar, my worldview probably would have been the same as majority

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:40.920
[Guest]: of people have there.

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:47.040
[Guest]: It changed, so it does change your worldview.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:51.840
[Guest]: But I think you need certain other triggers with it too.

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.320
[Guest]: I mean, you have to latch on to those triggers.

00:58:54.320 --> 00:59:02.120
[Guest]: Some people do latch on, some people may be so obdurate or so stubborn in their thinking

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:08.880
[Guest]: that they, instead of latching on to those triggers, they probably reinforce their, you

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:14.240
[Guest]: know, there is this comfort zone, which we all like to live.

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:23.600
[Guest]: And that comfort zone is like, the same ideas which you have, you want to recycle them and

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:29.000
[Guest]: feel comfortable with them instead of going into this uncomfortable zone where you're

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.760
[Guest]: questioning those ideas.

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:32.240
[Guest]: It's not easy.

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.240
[Guest]: It's not easy.

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:41.040
[Guest]: But yes, I think travel makes a person more, you accept, you realize there are differences.

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:45.520
[Guest]: In my case, and I'm sure in a majority of the cases, once you see that there are people

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:52.120
[Guest]: different, there are people who have a different religion, they have a different way of eating

00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:56.080
[Guest]: food, different way of, culturally they are different.

00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.440
[Guest]: And yet you see that they are as good or as bad human beings as your own people are.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.400
[Guest]: So you accept, you accept them.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.720
[Guest]: Once you start accepting them, your worldview also opens.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:13.200
[Guest]: You also try to, you also want to see the world from their perspective.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:19.240
[Guest]: In my case, yes, because interacting with, as you said, in Haryana, with different culture,

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:25.960
[Guest]: in Punjab, in Chandigarh, my interaction with the whole Sikh community opened my eyes to

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.880
[Guest]: a world which was very different from my world.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:35.560
[Guest]: I mean, very different from my gods, my religious beliefs.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:41.800
[Guest]: So yes, it has helped me, it has helped me to reach a stage where we are interacting

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:48.200
[Guest]: here and trying to explore a more pluralistic world and why there isn't a pluralistic world.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.200
[Amit Varma]: Is it getting destroyed?

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.760
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about your childhood now and your love for cricket.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:59.920
[Amit Varma]: And like one aspect of it, I'd like to sort of explore, which I think is hard for people

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.960
[Amit Varma]: today to kind of grasp, is that all of us who, so many of us who loved cricket back

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:10.640
[Amit Varma]: in the day, loved a cricket that was played in the imagination, because there is no television.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.500
[Amit Varma]: You know, all your sporting heroes, you've never actually seen them.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:17.400
[Amit Varma]: You might not even recognize them if you run across them in the road.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.120
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about how you fell in love with cricket.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.120
[Amit Varma]: How would you consume cricket?

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.400
[Amit Varma]: When did you feel that you want to be a player yourself?

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, just what was that sort of mahal like where?

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.680
[Guest]: I think it was that the school I was in Srinagar, Bernal School, it was a missionary school

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:37.480
[Guest]: and cricket was the main sport.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:42.920
[Guest]: And I would see young boys playing the game in their whites and this, you know, it's beautiful

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:49.240
[Guest]: to be playing in those trees, chenna trees, surrounded by chenna trees, the beautiful

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.240
[Guest]: green.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.120
[Guest]: It was like an English, British setting, whites and red ball.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.040
[Guest]: And then my brother was a good cricketer.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:02.000
[Guest]: So it somehow, it somehow happened that I don't even remember when I started playing

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
[Guest]: it.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.040
[Guest]: No, it just, it happened school simultaneously.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:12.920
[Guest]: And then you used to play in our lanes in around our house with young kids playing.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:22.920
[Guest]: And then I came to Panipat, I was a very terrible student and then because of this whole mismatch

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:28.760
[Guest]: of first English medium, then Hindi medium, I couldn't like, the language itself had become

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.760
[Guest]: a problem.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.920
[Guest]: I was neither here nor there.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:35.460
[Guest]: I was neither good at Hindi, nor good at English.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.240
[Guest]: And cricket came to my rescue.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:45.880
[Guest]: I mean, a very terrified student with fellow students troubling me and not good at studies.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:51.720
[Guest]: There was this trial in the school, I think I was in seventh or eighth and somehow I went

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:58.120
[Guest]: to the, gave the trial, I started, like they all thought that I was very good.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:03.440
[Guest]: And I probably must have been good enough for that school and that place.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:10.400
[Guest]: Because I remember that we won the inter-school championship, we had three school rivals.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:18.240
[Guest]: And I must have taken if I am not wrong, 10-10 wickets in almost every match with my offspin.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:22.680
[Guest]: So I was brought in a procession after we won the championship from the ground to the

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:30.280
[Guest]: school.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:38.920
[Guest]: So from a frightened young kid in an environment which he can't relate with and fearful, I

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.480
[Guest]: suddenly became a hero in the school.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:45.840
[Guest]: I mean, there was, I went in, the principal called me and they said, oh, we have won the

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.840
[Guest]: championship.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:52.720
[Guest]: Holiday was announced and my name was taken in the podium next day that he helped us win.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:04:02.360
[Guest]: So obviously that, but fortunately or unfortunately, small town, I mean, once we shifted to Amritsar,

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:08.640
[Guest]: which was a bigger place with the Amarnath brothers and Madanlal in college teams and

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:13.200
[Guest]: some of very good players of the region playing, I just, I chickened out.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:19.760
[Guest]: I thought that I can't, you know what happens, this whole complexity or complex of inferiority

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:28.040
[Guest]: complex comes in and I almost gave up, but yet my love of cricket and another thing which

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:35.960
[Guest]: fuelled that love of cricket was radio, which was, I remember this Amritsar, my grandfather,

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:40.960
[Guest]: my mother's father, parents, he was there, he was working in customs like my father and

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:47.200
[Guest]: must have been 60 because this was the Jasupatel's wicket-taking spell in which we defeated Australia

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.600
[Guest]: for the first time.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.920
[Guest]: So that commentary, like, no, we used to, we used to go to buy something and then look

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:58.000
[Guest]: for a paanwala where the radio was on and there used to be a huge gathering listening

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.280
[Guest]: to the commentary.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.900
[Guest]: So that love of the game came from radio.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:08.880
[Guest]: It was, as you were saying, I mean, we had not seen those cricketers, we didn't even

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.760
[Guest]: know how they looked like, but in our imagination, we had like created those figures larger than

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:22.680
[Guest]: life, larger than like great heroes and that's how the love of the game at that time people

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.880
[Amit Varma]: fell in love with that game.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, there's this passage of, you know, when you're in Amritsar, you mentioned what

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.660
[Amit Varma]: a big deal it was to see a West Indies versus North Zone game and you pointed out a couple

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:37.440
[Amit Varma]: of things there which I found charming and one was that because you didn't know the players,

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:42.000
[Amit Varma]: you were listening to radio commentary simultaneously and Tony Cozier was on and his commentary

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.400
[Amit Varma]: was so good that you said that it was like he was describing what would happen and then

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.520
[Amit Varma]: it happened, which is such a lovely way of sort of, you know, he was setting the scene

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:51.520
[Guest]: and then...

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.000
[Guest]: I mean, this is true.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.200
[Guest]: The way he would and a lot of those other commentators I discovered would anticipate

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:05.600
[Guest]: through the batsman's actions or this thing that you would actually feel that how did

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:10.560
[Guest]: he like know that this fellow is going to come forward, he's going to go back or this

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:16.000
[Guest]: fellow's fielding is outstanding because it would, the action would unfold after what

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.800
[Guest]: he had spoken.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.280
[Guest]: It really happened like that.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.320
[Amit Varma]: So it was amazing.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:22.480
[Amit Varma]: And it's mind blowing.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.400
[Amit Varma]: And just a little nugget for listeners who have never been inside a press box, you know,

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.540
[Amit Varma]: press box in my days of covering cricket, it was just the opposite.

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:34.720
[Amit Varma]: So what would happen is that you could be typing something and action happens and then

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:39.200
[Amit Varma]: the television shows it a couple of seconds late because there's a delay and that's useful

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.540
[Amit Varma]: for someone who's writing a piece because you don't want to miss the action.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.920
[Amit Varma]: But the moment you hear a crowd scream, you can just look at the TV and it's like, well,

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.360
[Amit Varma]: you see it fresh.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:50.600
[Amit Varma]: And the other thing besides this Tony Cozier comment that you mentioned, the other thing

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:57.120
[Amit Varma]: was that it was an educative experience for you to see the West Indies team fielding,

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:01.760
[Amit Varma]: because they seem to the moment the batsman would, you know, begin his footwork, they

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.680
[Amit Varma]: would anticipate where he's going to hit the ball or what shot he's going to play, and

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.440
[Amit Varma]: they would start moving.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:14.240
[Amit Varma]: And this got me to thinking about, as viewers, how we learn about the game.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:19.520
[Amit Varma]: Like, I think what happened was that when the television revolution really happened

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:25.120
[Amit Varma]: in the 90s, and satellite television came in, I think there was not just a boom in watching

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:31.040
[Amit Varma]: cricket, but there was a boom in understanding cricket in term, because you had so many commentators

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:35.480
[Amit Varma]: who are ex cricketers, talk about the values of the game that this is what he's doing.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.960
[Amit Varma]: And this is why he's doing and see this is a technique and look at the running between

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.480
[Amit Varma]: wickets and look at the fitness.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:46.240
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, what happens is that those values then percolate down to all the young

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:52.320
[Amit Varma]: players of tomorrow, who then are much fitter, much better, the basics are more right.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.160
[Amit Varma]: And what is of course, today happened is that the IPL actually turbocharged this.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.280
[Amit Varma]: So the levels of fitness that you see and everything are just way higher in the current

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.760
[Amit Varma]: generation and part of it is incentives.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:08.040
[Amit Varma]: But part of it is also how they are consuming cricket, which because they are getting everything

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:12.400
[Amit Varma]: in real time, they are seeing every shot, every action from multiple angles, they can

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:17.240
[Amit Varma]: go on YouTube and watch it again and again, or Hotstar and watch replays and all of that.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.640
[Amit Varma]: And in our time, that wasn't the case.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:24.600
[Amit Varma]: You couldn't, you know, you learned about the world in dribbles, not just cricket, but

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:30.160
[Amit Varma]: the world you learned about the world in dribbles, and you learned sort of whatever you could.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:33.780
[Amit Varma]: And so as you know, what are your sort of thoughts on this?

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:38.560
[Amit Varma]: Because you've lived through and written through, in a sense, all these eras.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:46.680
[Guest]: Well, now you say this, I started thinking that what if I had been watching those matches

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:53.880
[Guest]: live on television, like this one match I saw live, changed my whole orientation to

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:54.880
[Guest]: it.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:01.080
[Guest]: You know, what was to, how does one feel, how does one bat correctly, I realized that

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.520
[Guest]: and it helped me immensely.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:09.840
[Guest]: Imagine now watching every day, the best cricketers in the world in front of you.

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.080
[Guest]: And as a kid, it's what an education it must be.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:16.400
[Guest]: No wonder we have such large number of players.

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:23.440
[Guest]: I mean, India will probably make four, five, six, seven international teams, that's a number

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:26.480
[Guest]: of people who watch play.

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:31.960
[Guest]: And if you go to ground, if you take a look around, everyone who's playing wherever he's

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:34.920
[Guest]: playing, he's playing correct cricket, because they watched it.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.640
[Guest]: In our times, it wasn't like that, we didn't even know like, I remember in the school,

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.720
[Guest]: I when I was batting, I remember this, this quite interesting, actually, since you talk

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.080
[Guest]: about it.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:50.200
[Guest]: I had never faced a fastball, I was just seventh, eighth and there was this guy, we were matting,

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.480
[Guest]: I went to bat, and these short balls outside the outstump.

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:57.200
[Guest]: Now, I in my life had never seen the ball bounce so much.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.160
[Guest]: And I didn't know how to play that.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.360
[Guest]: Because I had not seen anyone bowl like that.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:09.280
[Guest]: And actually, I, I had to like, figure out, ask people that how does one play this ball?

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:14.420
[Guest]: I didn't know that there was a stroke to leave or to cut or because I had not watched it.

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:19.620
[Guest]: If I had at that, today's kid has watched these things, how to play, how to bat in these

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:26.080
[Guest]: kinds of circumstances or conditions right from when, right from their memory started.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.960
[Guest]: So imagine the kind of training they are getting, which which is good.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:35.520
[Guest]: It's good that so many people are watching it live and learning the game, learning it

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:38.900
[Guest]: properly through watching the best players in action.

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:43.740
[Amit Varma]: So I'd like to propose a controversial sort of just thinking aloud, I'd like to propose

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:48.040
[Amit Varma]: a controversial statement, which I already know you'll disagree with, but just to throw

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:54.840
[Amit Varma]: it out there, which is that one, because your ecosystem is so much wider today, because,

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, many more people have access to the game and are affluent enough to play it

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.160
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.800
[Amit Varma]: And because the level of education is so incredible in terms of, you know, just learning about

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.460
[Amit Varma]: the game from so many sources, that therefore and not just in cricket, but perhaps every

01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:17.200
[Amit Varma]: sport that every generation has to be the best generation there has ever been.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:23.040
[Amit Varma]: So a batsman, so the best batsman in the world ever is very likely to be somebody who is

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.360
[Amit Varma]: playing now, because as you get younger, you kind of get better and better.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:30.760
[Amit Varma]: And of course, your book is full of how much you you know, idealized with Richards and

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:34.800
[Amit Varma]: the way he played and you've got such beautiful descriptions of his batting and the impact

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.840
[Amit Varma]: it made on you.

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:40.040
[Amit Varma]: And there might be outliers from a previous generation who are at and who were at an incredible

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.040
[Amit Varma]: level.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:44.800
[Amit Varma]: So you know, the Bradman, Sobers, Richards, they have their own place.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:49.880
[Amit Varma]: But in general, I would say that, you know, the quality of talent that is there in every

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:55.680
[Amit Varma]: sport just because of these factors, that you will have many more people who are able

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.960
[Amit Varma]: to afford the leisure time to actually play when they're kids, and who can actually afford

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:00.960
[Amit Varma]: it.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:06.760
[Amit Varma]: And you have far more access to education and pedagogy and just you know, you'll find

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:10.760
[Amit Varma]: seven year olds who are playing cover drive with the elbow in the right position foot

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.900
[Amit Varma]: is moving perfectly all of that.

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:18.480
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, I would imagine that the quality of cricket that you see today is in absolute

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:23.880
[Amit Varma]: terms, way better than say what it would have been in the 60s or 70s.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:24.880
[Amit Varma]: What's what's your response?

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.880
[Guest]: No, no, I agree.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:34.480
[Guest]: I wouldn't disagree with this, the quality of batsmanship or bowling, maybe not as much

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:41.640
[Guest]: in bowling, maybe I mean, maybe you could go back because they used to play on tracks

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.820
[Guest]: which are not covered.

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:48.400
[Guest]: So the more difficult to this thing, see the fitness levels have improved techniques have

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:54.640
[Guest]: not only improved, but people have rediscovered that it's not necessary to have one technique

01:12:54.640 --> 01:13:00.300
[Guest]: to to in our times, anyone playing across the line would be hanged.

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:04.640
[Guest]: In today's time playing across the line as long as you're succeeding is a wonderful

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.640
[Guest]: shot.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:15.680
[Guest]: Yes, see the another way to look at it is that had anyone, any great player, good players

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:21.740
[Guest]: of any generation would have been good players wherever they were.

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:29.720
[Guest]: If today we think Virat Kohli or Sachin Tendulkar is a brand man, a brand man had been born

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:37.100
[Guest]: today because of see these cricketers have been given conditions, access, which those

01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:38.300
[Guest]: people didn't have.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:42.080
[Guest]: It's not as if they they're born in a vacuum, they're playing in a vacuum.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:50.520
[Guest]: So to compare, say a Bradman with Tendulkar and say Tendulkar fit more this thing better

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:57.960
[Guest]: would be I think a wrong way to look at it because Bradman didn't have Tendulkar's support,

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:04.080
[Guest]: which Tendulkar has or Virat has or any anyone Ricky Ponting has.

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:11.720
[Guest]: So things change, techniques, see a different way to look at it is let's pick up tennis.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:17.480
[Guest]: Now to think that anyone can play like Nadal or Djokovic or Federer in the earlier era

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.160
[Guest]: when you watch with wooden rackets.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:24.760
[Guest]: So you think that all these guys are so superior, why are we saying that those guys were as

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.800
[Guest]: great?

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:30.920
[Guest]: And they were as great because they were playing in conditions which were provided to them

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:33.360
[Guest]: in that they were the best.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:42.480
[Guest]: So if they were to reborn today in these conditions, they would also be as good as they were then.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:51.040
[Guest]: So that's why comparing one generation to another generation is very difficult and judgment

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:55.920
[Guest]: should be made by watching them and saying, Oh, look, this fellow is far superior.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and that's a great point.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:03.680
[Amit Varma]: And that's a point I sometimes make in the context of writing, like I remember in one

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.640
[Amit Varma]: of my, I teach an online course on writing and a participant in one of my cohorts asked

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:13.160
[Amit Varma]: me that, why are writers of the 19th century or 18th century so boring?

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, the question he asked me was, you respect Adam Smith and John Locke so much,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.880
[Amit Varma]: but their prose is so turgid.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.680
[Amit Varma]: And my point is that look, today, we are surrounded by all the books in the world.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:30.400
[Amit Varma]: And there has been, you know, this evolution in the way people write, that our values have

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.400
[Amit Varma]: evolved along with that, how to write crisp prose, how to structure a piece, all of that,

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:38.160
[Amit Varma]: we have so many examples to choose from, our learning is much better.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.520
[Amit Varma]: But if you're writing in the 18th century, there is so little literature around you,

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:47.560
[Amit Varma]: and you have so little access to most of it, that you it's almost like you're writing sui

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:51.560
[Amit Varma]: generi, right, you're having to make it up as you go along, almost like you playing that

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.920
[Amit Varma]: short ball on a matting wicket in the nets when you've never seen before.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:00.480
[Amit Varma]: So given those restrictions to see the kind of writing that a Locke or a Smith did, is

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.480
[Amit Varma]: amazing.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.420
[Amit Varma]: They are still incredibly lucid and cogent and all of that.

01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:08.360
[Amit Varma]: But they will, of course, they will sort of, you know, be different, they will sort of

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:09.360
[Amit Varma]: read differently.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:14.320
[Amit Varma]: So it's a category error, even to compare a Bradman to a Tendulkar, or I would say even

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.280
[Amit Varma]: a Tendulkar to whoever the hot 18 year old at the moment is, because so much has just

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280
[Amit Varma]: changed.

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.080
[Guest]: To compare Virat with Tendulkar, I mean, these are unfair comparison.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:33.520
[Amit Varma]: So there's another really interesting nugget that is there in your Panipat chapter, where

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:38.880
[Amit Varma]: you talk about how you would, you know, look at sports magazines or whatever, and you write

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:43.440
[Amit Varma]: quote, the pictures that would fascinate the most were those of white players, besides

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.720
[Amit Varma]: their outstanding performances, this could also have something to do with our subconsciously

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.700
[Amit Varma]: admiring their white skin.

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:54.240
[Amit Varma]: Even today, I remember the names of the Australian Paul Sheehan, the Englishman MJK Smith, or

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.240
[Amit Varma]: the New Zealander Graham Dowling, not because I remember any of their feats, but because

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:03.440
[Amit Varma]: of a fair, blue eyed, handsome, debonair young men in whites adorning the cover or the center

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:10.080
[Amit Varma]: spread of the magazine, battling these giants of the game were our puny Indians, stop quote.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:16.960
[Amit Varma]: And I'm again relating this to something that is been a broader thing in our society, that

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:21.440
[Amit Varma]: there is this almost postcolonial mindset, where we behave as if the white person is

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:27.440
[Amit Varma]: superior to us, right, like I remember, in my cricketing days, I was when I was the managing

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.280
[Amit Varma]: editor of Crick Info, I had gone to cover a game live with a colleague of mine who was

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.280
[Amit Varma]: from England.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.280
[Amit Varma]: So he's white.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:37.440
[Amit Varma]: So technically, in a sense, I'm, you know, senior to him and all that I'm his boss.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:42.200
[Amit Varma]: But when we walk into the ground, you know, I am stopped and ask 1000 questions, but he's

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:47.280
[Amit Varma]: just waved on through, which is fine, but which reflects that sort of mindset, like

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.240
[Amit Varma]: in certain tourist spots, the way they speak to white people in the way they treat you,

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:55.600
[Amit Varma]: which is not how it happens in most of the rest of the world, where they'll treat everybody

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.600
[Amit Varma]: equally.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:02.720
[Amit Varma]: And I see this sort of inferiority complex, even in the case of something like the development

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:09.400
[Amit Varma]: of the English language, like the reason, you know, so many of us speak in speak English

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:16.120
[Amit Varma]: or write English in suboptimal archaic ways, is I believe, because in India, English has

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:21.920
[Amit Varma]: been a marker of class, or a marker of where you stand in society, for all these decades.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.280
[Amit Varma]: So if you want to signal that you're socially superior to the people around you, you do

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.520
[Amit Varma]: it with your sophisticated English.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:34.600
[Amit Varma]: And one way you do this is by optimizing for seeming sophistication by being too verbose.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:38.680
[Amit Varma]: So instead of somebody say using a simple, beautiful word like stop, they'll say put

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:42.800
[Amit Varma]: an end to put an end to this pontificatory nonsense, you know, using five words where

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.120
[Amit Varma]: you could use one word, and and so on.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.880
[Amit Varma]: There are so many examples of this, and the British have left these pomposities behind,

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:53.240
[Amit Varma]: you won't see them speaking like this or writing like this, but we still do it.

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.140
[Amit Varma]: And this complex has been there.

01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:59.920
[Amit Varma]: And there is one narrative that which I broadly agree with, is that with liberalization and

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:04.840
[Amit Varma]: globalization and opening up to the world, we began to be more self confident and come

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.920
[Amit Varma]: out of it and assert ourselves.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:11.080
[Amit Varma]: Some people look at you know, Ganguly opening a shirt at Lord's as a really good thing,

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.200
[Amit Varma]: a sign that we are not cowed down by them anymore, you know, we'll take them on and

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.800
[Amit Varma]: beat them and all of that.

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:23.240
[Amit Varma]: But just as a broader sort of social thing, you know, is this something that we have come

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.640
[Amit Varma]: out of, it is behind us?

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:31.800
[Amit Varma]: Or is it something that still sort of bedevils us and still afflicts our society?

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:35.720
[Amit Varma]: Because even now, the validation of the white man seems so important, you will find our

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:41.480
[Amit Varma]: Prime Minister respond much more, you know, negatively to something published in New York

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.020
[Amit Varma]: Times to something published in an Indian newspaper.

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:49.360
[Amit Varma]: It's almost like that validation of the white man is still kind of important, where, you

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:55.360
[Amit Varma]: know, the films that win the Oscars are still, you know, at a pedestal compared to, you know,

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.080
[Amit Varma]: what we might produce?

01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:01.520
[Guest]: I think this is a very, very interesting question.

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:07.760
[Guest]: And my reason for including that was also the fact that I wanted to convey that in that

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:14.680
[Guest]: period, how we were like, no, we would adore like, we'll say, oh, white man, and in a conscious

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:20.760
[Guest]: and subconscious English willow and, and their pets and everything was like, we were like,

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:29.120
[Guest]: no, poor people, and under not only bad players, but, but, but maybe inferior culturally as

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:32.400
[Guest]: well in our minds, that was the kind of inferiority complex.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:41.560
[Guest]: I think we have, we still may need their validation, we still may suffer from that kind of inferiority

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:48.200
[Guest]: complex, and I think that is the reflection of that I feel is that we have gone to other

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:56.560
[Guest]: extreme also, like we are, today we are like, like there is in this book, The Guardian,

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:02.280
[Guest]: I think it was The Guardian correspondent who was in Bombay, and this is, I think, David's

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.800
[Guest]: 100th Test match, and we all are there at the ground.

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:10.200
[Guest]: And as you were mentioning that people are, if they see a white skinned man, the police

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:16.880
[Guest]: will say go, now, there, this man also is being hassled, and he's, he's part of our

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:19.720
[Guest]: entourage and he's being pushed around.

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:27.840
[Guest]: And he says that, look, 10 years back or 20 years back, this was my white skin was a passport

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:35.320
[Guest]: or pass for me to enter anywhere in India, today, India's changed, they will lynch me.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:42.520
[Guest]: So, so this reverse kind of a mentality, you know, we, we have to, if, if we think that

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:48.160
[Guest]: we have, we are now a self confident, confident, assertive nation, then we have to reach a

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:55.300
[Guest]: stage where we treat them with as much respect and dignity as any human being deserves.

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:59.720
[Guest]: And if they if we feel there's something wrong, we react with, with respect and with dignity

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:05.080
[Guest]: not like will kill you and who are you and you cheated us and I think this kind of a

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:09.800
[Guest]: discourse reflects again our inferiority, I feel, I may be wrong, it reflects a kind

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:15.600
[Guest]: of a that inferiority complex, which says that, okay, you treated me badly now, since

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:23.560
[Guest]: I have, I've reached a stage where I have, I have money, I have a space in, in the world,

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.480
[Guest]: I will also treat you badly.

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:26.480
[Guest]: What does it reflect?

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:31.480
[Guest]: I don't think it reflects good on our part.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:38.440
[Guest]: I think, as I was saying earlier, also, okay, fine, you, you people, it's, it's individuals,

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:44.520
[Guest]: as we are saying, the abstract and the concrete individuals will be some may be good, some

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:51.960
[Guest]: may be bad, but to, to interact with the abstract becomes a whole different world.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:58.800
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about this journey from sort of playing cricket to thinking that you could

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.280
[Amit Varma]: write about it, like cricket at one point, you mentioned that you after being initially

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.480
[Amit Varma]: intimidated by the scene in Amritsar, you I think even when you moved to Chandigarh,

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:08.640
[Guest]: you got back to playing again.

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I played for my campus team.

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.120
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, yeah.

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.320
[Amit Varma]: And you were a swashbuckling stroke player, was it?

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:19.760
[Guest]: I was a little bit both bowler and a batsman, bit of both.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:20.760
[Amit Varma]: Incredible.

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:23.800
[Amit Varma]: And, and then you had a back injury and you kind of stopped playing and all of that.

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:26.160
[Guest]: A great loss for cricket, but not for cricket journalism.

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:36.680
[Amit Varma]: So were you always interested in writing, or is it something that, but serendipitously,

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.080
[Amit Varma]: it happened that you got that chance and we'll speak about how you got into it also.

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.480
[Amit Varma]: But you know, before that, would you read a lot?

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:45.200
[Amit Varma]: Would you think I want to write?

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:46.840
[Guest]: Was that something that sort of?

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:54.160
[Guest]: I had never imagined or thought about myself to, to become a journalist, to become a writer.

01:23:54.160 --> 01:24:01.360
[Guest]: I was like, like most of the students around me, wondering what, I mean, you get into BA

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:08.560
[Guest]: graduate because karna hi hai, my parents, like any other parents wanted me to do, become

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:11.480
[Guest]: a doctor, but I wasn't a good enough student.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:16.160
[Guest]: I would hardly get pass marks.

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:23.120
[Guest]: So it was at that stage, Shekhar, Shekhar happened to be with me in school.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:28.600
[Guest]: And then I met Shekhar again in the university and he, he already was thinking of becoming

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:29.600
[Guest]: a journalist.

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.440
[Guest]: He had done his journalism course.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:40.480
[Guest]: He was freelancing and then Express opened its edition in 78 in Chandigarh and he straight

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:45.680
[Guest]: away got a job and then he pulled me in and then Prabhat Joshi was the writer.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:48.680
[Guest]: We watched cricket together as I described in the book.

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:53.640
[Guest]: So my getting into journalism was sheer connection.

01:24:53.640 --> 01:25:01.300
[Guest]: I mean, I do realize when I look back that when I, these days when journalism students

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:06.680
[Guest]: probably come from journalism schools, they appear in tests and in my case and in most

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:14.320
[Guest]: of my generation, I think they happened to come into journalism because they knew someone.

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.440
[Guest]: Somebody's father was there.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.600
[Guest]: So his son became a journalist.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:22.000
[Guest]: So no, I had never even, I could never, I look back.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.120
[Guest]: I just think it's a miracle that was Shekhar my classmate in school and he happened to

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:30.160
[Guest]: meet me in the university.

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:35.600
[Guest]: Was it some kind of a miracle that, that some destiny wanted me to become a journalist because

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.720
[Amit Varma]: I had never even thought about it.

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:38.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:43.840
[Amit Varma]: And you've described about how, you know, there was some series and you and Shekhar and, you

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.800
[Amit Varma]: know, other people would go to this place to watch television and Prabhat Joshi, who

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:53.400
[Amit Varma]: was Indian Express, Indian Express, a resident editor started chatting with you about cricket

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.120
[Amit Varma]: and then said, okay, do you want to join me?

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:58.720
[Amit Varma]: I'm, you know, hiring a couple of writers and that's how it happened.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:07.680
[Amit Varma]: And it just strikes me that how it's so, how so many things are so contingent and it doesn't

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:12.000
[Amit Varma]: happen like if you're in a different class or a different school and you never meet Shekhar,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.560
[Amit Varma]: this sort of never happens.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.280
[Amit Varma]: Have you ever thought about the counterfactual?

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.080
[Amit Varma]: Like what would you have been in those days?

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:21.800
[Amit Varma]: Where did you think life was taking you and how would it have?

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:27.400
[Guest]: Look, I was, I was, I mean, I don't remember how much worried I was.

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:31.840
[Guest]: My parents must have been, I was, I was just enrolled in MA Literature, this thing.

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:34.080
[Guest]: It was not as if that was my passion.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:39.000
[Guest]: And I was planning something big that I will become a professor or a teacher.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:46.240
[Guest]: And I was just thinking of enrolling, trying to look at bank exams, you see.

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.640
[Guest]: Those days, I think banking jobs were important.

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:55.000
[Guest]: Somewhere in LIC or bank or anywhere where you could get a job, I was, I was thinking

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.960
[Guest]: about should, when to apply and I was also worried thinking that I'm not, I didn't have

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:00.960
[Guest]: the confidence.

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:05.520
[Guest]: I'm not good enough to, my math was like a lot of people's maths is very bad.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.360
[Guest]: And in those exams, your maths should be good.

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.200
[Guest]: So I was worried, wondering what to do, what not to do.

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:18.900
[Guest]: And I probably, if I had not met Shekhar, if I had not gone into journalism because

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:24.440
[Guest]: of these connections or sheer chance happened, I would have been a bank clerk or something

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.920
[Guest]: maybe through promotions.

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:32.040
[Guest]: Maybe I retired as senior officer or I don't know.

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:36.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, reading your book, there is one moment which really startled me because

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.320
[Amit Varma]: something that happened to you also indirectly changed the course of my life, which is that

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:47.480
[Amit Varma]: you were in the early 2000s, you were being considered for the role of the editor of the

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:49.800
[Amit Varma]: Wisden magazine, right?

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:50.960
[Amit Varma]: And you almost got it.

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:53.560
[Amit Varma]: But then at that final interview stage, you didn't get it.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:57.800
[Amit Varma]: And the person who got it was Sambit Bal, started Wisden Asia Cricket.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.920
[Amit Varma]: And and I joined Sambit.

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:03.600
[Amit Varma]: And what happened was before that in the 90s, my experience was television, Channel V and

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.600
[Amit Varma]: MTV.

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:07.140
[Amit Varma]: And then I tried to do a startup around 2000.

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:10.400
[Amit Varma]: But Nasdaq crashed, everything collapsed.

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.200
[Amit Varma]: And so I had nothing and nowhere to go.

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.040
[Amit Varma]: But I happen to know Sambit.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:15.320
[Amit Varma]: So the same connection thing, right?

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.680
[Amit Varma]: You happen to know Shekhar.

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.200
[Amit Varma]: So I happen to know Sambit.

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.760
[Amit Varma]: So I got a job working with him.

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:23.080
[Amit Varma]: And then we bought Crickinfo and all of that sort of happened.

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:26.560
[Amit Varma]: And so I don't know what direction my life would have gone in and what else I would have

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.560
[Amit Varma]: done.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.600
[Amit Varma]: I don't have a counterfactual.

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:32.000
[Amit Varma]: But I can guarantee you that it would have gone in a different direction.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.240
[Amit Varma]: But just the events, you know, it's a set of dominoes.

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.280
[Guest]: So the set of dominoes would go in some other direction.

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.680
[Guest]: You know, something very interesting, what you're saying, I'll add to it.

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:48.800
[Guest]: I was in Chandigarh and Rohit Mahajan, who's the Tribune Sports editor, who helped me in

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:49.800
[Guest]: the book.

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:52.520
[Guest]: He saw the manuscript and this thing.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.960
[Guest]: So we were there, it's only 15 days, fortnight back.

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:57.960
[Guest]: And we started laughing.

01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:05.200
[Guest]: And he said that, look, if Shekhar had not met you, you wouldn't have become a journalist.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:12.200
[Guest]: And if you had not become a journalist, there are so many people whom you hired or you were

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:15.680
[Guest]: connected with, they also would have suffered.

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.520
[Guest]: So this is a chain.

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:23.560
[Guest]: These are all chain reactions, which you don't know what connection, where and how.

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:27.880
[Guest]: And actually, one doesn't even know what the alternate would have been.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:28.880
[Guest]: Would have been far better.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.840
[Guest]: I mean, how does one know?

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:31.840
[Guest]: One doesn't know.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:32.840
[Guest]: You also wouldn't know that.

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:35.200
[Guest]: You are happy with what you are doing.

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.320
[Guest]: That's why you feel that.

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:42.000
[Guest]: But if you are not happy with what you are doing, you might have thought that, oh, what

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
[Guest]: my bad luck.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000
[Guest]: Why did I know this man?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
[Guest]: He got me here.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:50.360
[Guest]: No, I would have thought that, oh, Shekhar, I wish I had not met Shekhar there.

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:54.200
[Guest]: I'm so unhappy in this profession, which I was.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:30:01.200
[Guest]: See at one point when I am in Delhi, I mean, I believe that I will be going to become the

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.360
[Guest]: sports editor there, which they don't make it.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.440
[Guest]: I am so miserable and unhappy.

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:08.960
[Guest]: And that's the stage where I might have been thinking that why did I come into this profession?

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:11.080
[Amit Varma]: You're damn Shekhar Gupta.

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:17.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, no, it's interesting how, you know, little things, it's like a butterfly flies

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.760
[Amit Varma]: its wings and suddenly the weather in another country is completely different.

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:25.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that's, of course, sort of overstating it, but that's, it's, it's, yeah.

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:29.040
[Amit Varma]: So I read that little bit and I said, oh, my God, because I didn't know you, right?

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:30.960
[Amit Varma]: So I'm never joining Wisdom because I don't know you.

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:35.920
[Amit Varma]: I happen to know Sambit and he used to edit Gentleman and another magazine and I had written

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:37.160
[Amit Varma]: for them also.

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.080
[Amit Varma]: So there was some kind of connection.

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:42.080
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise, I am going on a completely different path.

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:44.200
[Amit Varma]: And who knows where it takes me.

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:51.680
[Amit Varma]: And so it's really interesting to sort of, I think, reflecting like this on these accidents

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:55.280
[Amit Varma]: of life should make all of us humble.

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:59.720
[Amit Varma]: Because whatever good has happened, it means so much luck is involved in the things that

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:00.720
[Guest]: have happened to you.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:04.560
[Guest]: We live in an interdependent world.

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:10.600
[Guest]: You are dependent on me, I am dependent on you, we nobody, no individual is operating

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.040
[Guest]: in a vacuum.

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:18.400
[Guest]: If anyone thinks that things are happening because of him or her is living in some kind

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:22.640
[Guest]: of a world which doesn't exist, unless we realize this interdependence.

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:26.760
[Guest]: And this is again, I've learned from Buddhism, because for them, this is a very, very, the

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:31.760
[Guest]: most important concept is interdependence.

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:36.920
[Guest]: This interdependence has to be understood in its proper context to make you realize

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:39.360
[Guest]: that be humble.

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:42.320
[Guest]: You are nothing on your own, you are nothing, you're empty.

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, absolutely.

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:48.120
[Amit Varma]: And you know, if for all the listeners, if you're listening to this, why don't you pause,

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:52.440
[Amit Varma]: take a few moments, think about the accidents in your life, that, you know, got you to wherever

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:55.200
[Amit Varma]: you are, it could be a good place, it could be a bad place.

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:59.200
[Amit Varma]: I think, you know, one of the, one of the things I learned from my years playing poker,

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:04.560
[Amit Varma]: one of the learnings I took out is that in our lives, we underestimate the role of luck

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:08.560
[Amit Varma]: massively, you know, good things happen to us.

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.920
[Amit Varma]: And we let it get to our heads.

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:15.640
[Amit Varma]: We think, I am so good, I am so talented, and we become arrogant, or bad things happen

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:16.880
[Amit Varma]: to us.

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:19.160
[Amit Varma]: And we let it, you know, get us down.

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:26.120
[Amit Varma]: And we think, you know, instead of realizing that most of what happens to us is luck, right

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:30.880
[Amit Varma]: from where we are born to the genes we have to the circumstances we are in, to meeting

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:34.200
[Guest]: Shekhar Gupta in school.

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:38.760
[Amit Varma]: And to keep meeting him again and again in different cities.

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:44.720
[Amit Varma]: So there's just, you know, so much of luck, and that's a humbling thought.

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:47.440
[Amit Varma]: So you know, we'll, let's take a quick commercial break.

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:50.600
[Amit Varma]: And when on the other side of it, we'll, you know, get back to your fascinating journey

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:54.560
[Amit Varma]: through journalism.

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:57.600
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it?

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.000
[Amit Varma]: Well, I'd love to help you.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.880
[Amit Varma]: Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, the art of clear writing,

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:08.480
[Amit Varma]: an online community has now sprung up of all my past students, we have workshops, a newsletter

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:12.160
[Amit Varma]: to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community interaction.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:16.480
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.680
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing.

01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:22.600
[Amit Varma]: There are many exercises, much interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of

01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:23.600
[Amit Varma]: it.

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:27.720
[Amit Varma]: The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST, or about $150, and is a monthly thing.

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:32.640
[Amit Varma]: So if you're interested, head on over to register at IndiaUncut.com slash clear writing.

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:35.400
[Amit Varma]: It's IndiaUncut.com slash clear writing.

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:40.200
[Amit Varma]: Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:43.760
[Amit Varma]: and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills.

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:47.200
[Amit Varma]: I can help you.

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.560
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen.

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:53.760
[Amit Varma]: I'm having a delightful conversation with Pradeep magazine, and we've just sort of covered

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:57.800
[Amit Varma]: his life to the point where, you know, where you've joined journalism.

01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:04.880
[Amit Varma]: So you know, what's interesting is that all the other journalists have spoken before you

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:09.660
[Amit Varma]: on the show spoken to before you on the show, have wanted to be writers from the start.

01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:13.480
[Amit Varma]: So they will be like, I used to read so and so, and I used to try reading this, writing

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.080
[Amit Varma]: this and all of that.

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:19.360
[Amit Varma]: And in your case, in a sense, is your love of cricket, and it's your, you know, sort

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:23.200
[Amit Varma]: of the circumstances and everything which take you into writing about cricket.

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:28.320
[Amit Varma]: So in that early phase, where you're being a journalist, how do you sort of learn to

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.320
[Amit Varma]: be a journalist?

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:33.440
[Amit Varma]: Because right now, somebody who's getting into journalism now, you have the world's

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:38.160
[Amit Varma]: journalism available to you, you have journalism courses online available to you, you have

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:43.720
[Amit Varma]: how to videos available to you, you can watch videos about writing, you can do all of that.

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:47.720
[Amit Varma]: But back in the day, we didn't have all of this again, everything would come in drips

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:48.760
[Amit Varma]: and drabs.

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:55.200
[Amit Varma]: So what is your notion of journalism, and how do you begin then, to learn the values

01:34:55.200 --> 01:35:00.760
[Amit Varma]: of journalism, what is a good practice, what is not a good practice, are there any role

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:04.040
[Amit Varma]: models you have, or people who impress you?

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:11.400
[Guest]: You see, when I got into journalism, maybe my I see when you're young, especially when

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:19.960
[Guest]: you haven't entered the adult world of jobs, and I was an idealist, like, I'm sure like

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:26.840
[Guest]: my friends and other like, like, they're always these as a student, these values of wrong

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:29.880
[Guest]: right are very strong in you.

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:33.840
[Guest]: I guess they were in me as well.

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:40.320
[Guest]: I got introduced to since I was doing English literature, so I was at least reading books

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:46.440
[Guest]: which were fixed on the like, Dickens or Shakespeare studies, and though I was a bad student, but

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:52.760
[Guest]: at least the living impressions in my mind I was.

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:59.160
[Guest]: And so I had this, I think, strong, strong beliefs in right values and right values in

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:06.120
[Guest]: the sense that you should be objective, though, the understanding of objectivity is changed

01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:10.440
[Guest]: no matter how objective you can be, one always comes from a point of view.

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:16.440
[Guest]: When I joined, I realized that my language skills were bad.

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:22.520
[Guest]: I mean, my mind may have been involved with a lot of different things, but my writing

01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:25.440
[Guest]: skills weren't good.

01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:29.440
[Guest]: First thing I did was I tried to find out what book can I read to understand the game

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:35.280
[Guest]: better because I realized that unless you are on top of your subject, and that you should

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:39.360
[Guest]: know the technique, I had played cricket, but that doesn't mean the level of cricket

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.680
[Guest]: I played wasn't that high.

01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:45.480
[Guest]: But even that doesn't guarantee your understanding of its technicalities.

01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:48.560
[Guest]: The book I read was Don Bredman's Art of Coaching.

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:51.120
[Guest]: I mean, that was the book at that time, everyone.

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.120
[Guest]: Art of Cricket.

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:53.120
[Guest]: Art of Cricket.

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:54.120
[Guest]: Yes.

01:36:54.120 --> 01:37:00.000
[Guest]: So I read that book, it changed my whole writing style also, because I got into the technique

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.520
[Guest]: of cricket far more seriously, which I hadn't done as a student of the game.

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:11.760
[Guest]: It was like, go and play at the nets and if somebody offers you an advice, you take it.

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:17.040
[Guest]: Then I realized Times of India had Ray Robinson writing in it.

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:23.160
[Guest]: I got deeply influenced by, because I found that economy of words, I mean, there used

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:30.040
[Guest]: to be a four, five, six paragraph report and he used to say so much in that limited space.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:34.360
[Guest]: It was an amazing experience and I started copying him.

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:39.600
[Guest]: I mean, I realized that I had based my writing style on Ray Robinson.

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:40.880
[Guest]: It was impossible to copy him.

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:41.880
[Guest]: I wasn't good enough.

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:49.040
[Guest]: My language wasn't my forte, but I started trying to be precise and condense.

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:57.920
[Guest]: So these are two people, Bradman's book and Ray Robinson's writings, which helped me to

01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.440
[Guest]: write better.

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.980
[Guest]: And maybe I used to reflect a lot also, because I would, like anyone else, read my reports

01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:11.400
[Guest]: and only find errors in it, that why did I write like this, why I didn't write like this.

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:16.440
[Guest]: So I guess that's how I tried to improve my writing skills.

01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:22.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and that's what you said about, you know, reading your reports and always finding

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:26.680
[Amit Varma]: faults in it is something that I think all of us do consciously.

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:31.000
[Amit Varma]: And these days, like when I talk to my writing students, I talk about that process through

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:37.840
[Amit Varma]: the frame of thinking about one's writing facilities being divided into two things.

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:42.280
[Amit Varma]: And one is the ability to write and the other is a judgment of writing.

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:46.840
[Amit Varma]: So what when you write something and you read it and you think, oh, this is shit, what is

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:51.320
[Amit Varma]: happening is that your judgment is ahead of your ability at that point in time.

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:52.320
[Amit Varma]: But that's all.

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:55.580
[Amit Varma]: And that's a good thing, because it means that you keep working harder, your ability

01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:56.880
[Amit Varma]: keeps catching up.

01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:02.000
[Amit Varma]: So the more you read, and the more you write, the more your judgment evolves.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.200
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, with all the practice that you put in, your ability is catching

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.080
[Amit Varma]: up one step at a time.

01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:13.000
[Amit Varma]: So it's actually an extremely useful process for a writer to look back at their work and

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.600
[Amit Varma]: not like it, because it means that judgment is evolving and the ability will kind of sort

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:22.920
[Amit Varma]: of get there, which is another reason I sort of tell my students that if you write something

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:27.400
[Amit Varma]: and you think it's rubbish, you know, that is not a reason to stop writing and to beat

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:30.240
[Amit Varma]: yourself up and say, oh, mujhe nahi aata, mere se nahi hoga.

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.440
[Amit Varma]: That is actually a reason to continue, because it means that your judgment is evolving.

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:38.920
[Amit Varma]: And it always evolves quicker than your ability itself.

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:42.280
[Amit Varma]: And it's just a question of putting in the work and the ability catches up.

01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:46.960
[Amit Varma]: And Ray Robinson is a great model, like the other, you know, I often contrast Ray Robinson

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:48.960
[Amit Varma]: with someone like Neville Cardus.

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:52.240
[Amit Varma]: And I find Neville Cardus too poetic and flowery and all of that.

01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:56.280
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, and I think there's a danger for a young writer to try to be like Cardus.

01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:00.880
[Amit Varma]: I would be like, if you just go for economy of prose, like you said, chaar para mein

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.080
[Amit Varma]: itna kuch bol diya.

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:06.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, and Robinson is sort of a great example of that.

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:13.760
[Amit Varma]: What is the journalism world like in terms of, you know, the hierarchies and the kind

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:18.080
[Amit Varma]: of things you're allowed to cover, like you have a very interesting story before you became

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.080
[Amit Varma]: a journalist.

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:23.920
[Amit Varma]: In fact, when Shekhar was a journalist, where he went to, he was covering this tennis tournament

01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:28.920
[Amit Varma]: in which Ramnathan Krishnan and Ramesh Krishnan, who was in a young teenager, were both playing.

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:32.200
[Amit Varma]: And he covered the whole tournament to the point they reached the final.

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.320
[Amit Varma]: And he knew it was going to be a front page story.

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.440
[Amit Varma]: He was very excited.

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:37.160
[Amit Varma]: Father versus son in the final.

01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.160
[Amit Varma]: And he goes there.

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:43.200
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, then he sees the sort of the resident editor or the sports editor R.

01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:44.600
[Amit Varma]: Sreeman walking in.

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:47.840
[Amit Varma]: And he realizes that shit, that guy is going to write the report.

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:51.480
[Amit Varma]: And that guy also had good reasons because R. Sreeman had seen Ramnathan play with his

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:52.760
[Amit Varma]: father many years back.

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:55.440
[Amit Varma]: Toh waha bhi narrative aag toh hai hi.

01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:58.780
[Amit Varma]: But you know, poor Shekhar, the young journalist misses out.

01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:04.560
[Amit Varma]: And I remember, you know, when I entered cricket journalism with Sambit's team back in the

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:10.200
[Amit Varma]: early 2000s, and I remember I was with a bunch of, you know, I had a bunch of young colleagues

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:16.680
[Amit Varma]: like myself, like Rahul Bhattacharya, and a bunch of us later on, you know, Sidhvi,

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:19.980
[Amit Varma]: who you mentioned in the book, Anand Vasu, who you mentioned in your book.

01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:25.040
[Amit Varma]: And I remember at one point, I sensed this resentment from the older journalists who

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:27.360
[Amit Varma]: were in their 40s or 50s.

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:31.880
[Amit Varma]: And one of them who used to work for a news agency, one day took me aside and said, you

01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:38.120
[Amit Varma]: know what ki, I started as a stringer in this news agency, then I worked with this big newspaper,

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:42.960
[Amit Varma]: it took me 12 years before before I was allowed to cover an India cricket match.

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:46.760
[Amit Varma]: Because first you're covering your local tennis match, your local this your local dad, you

01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:53.600
[Amit Varma]: move up the ranks to be able to cover an actual match by India is such a big privilege.

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:55.460
[Amit Varma]: And you have to do so much to get there.

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:59.440
[Amit Varma]: So obviously, there are these young whippersnapper kids like myself who are like too oversmart,

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.440
[Amit Varma]: right?

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:03.760
[Amit Varma]: You think the word of yourself, because you haven't seen enough of it.

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:07.320
[Amit Varma]: And and you're immediately covering test cricket and you're like sitting in press box and being

01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:08.600
[Amit Varma]: a hero.

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:13.000
[Amit Varma]: So what was that journey like through journalism for you?

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:21.640
[Guest]: See, when I started international cricket, wasn't that much there, no, the Ranji cricket

01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:22.640
[Guest]: was huge.

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:27.120
[Guest]: You read stories, even interclub matches used to get huge treatment.

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:32.640
[Guest]: So this aspiration to straightway become an international reporter, in the sense to write

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:39.080
[Guest]: on India matches, wasn't there that much because opportunities were very few and far and used

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:43.600
[Guest]: to get your proper bylines by covering Ranji cricket.

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:51.020
[Guest]: A, B, there was also this feeling, which was among all my colleagues when I was young that

01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:56.440
[Guest]: there are these seniors who cover almost everything on their own, be it Olympic Games, there used

01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.920
[Guest]: to, I mean, there were no specialists.

01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:04.080
[Guest]: Right now you have like somebody's covering cricket, somebody's, they're different people.

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.600
[Guest]: In my period, it wasn't like that.

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:10.680
[Guest]: I think the sports editor or whoever was senior and had greater access would cover everything.

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:15.920
[Guest]: They go to, R. Sharimaan has covered, would cover World Hockey, would cover Olympic Games,

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:20.920
[Guest]: would cover cricket series, though Times of India had K. N. Prabhu, who was probably more

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.600
[Guest]: senior than him.

01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:28.600
[Guest]: And so there was this hierarchy was there and it was difficult to break that hierarchy.

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:34.800
[Guest]: So I'm again, I would consider myself lucky that I was in Chandigarh, which wasn't the

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:41.640
[Guest]: main centre for Indian Express, Express was in Delhi and yet I started getting, people

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:43.800
[Guest]: thought maybe I write well.

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:49.360
[Guest]: I think more important than that was that, see, journalists used to have an annual gathering,

01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:55.420
[Guest]: get together or there was a federation and they used to organise interzonal cricket tournaments.

01:43:55.420 --> 01:44:01.600
[Guest]: So I, since I had played a bit of cricket, I was a major star for North Zone in that

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:02.600
[Guest]: period.

01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:05.580
[Guest]: So I helped them a few times win the championship.

01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:11.240
[Guest]: That actually probably played an equally important role in other people accepting that this cricket

01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:15.080
[Guest]: plays well, so give it a chance, even the office thought.

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:21.380
[Guest]: So those things, I think I was lucky to get those breaks.

01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:27.200
[Guest]: But there was a very strong hierarchy, very strong hierarchy, which is less now.

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:31.800
[Guest]: I mean, there would be more heartburns now because there are more people, more, I would

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:37.560
[Guest]: say the quality of journalism today, unfortunately, maybe print is not giving, providing enough

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:41.320
[Guest]: space is far better than it was during my time.

01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:46.360
[Guest]: There are people who are trained, who have done proper studies, they are not people like

01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:52.120
[Guest]: me who just happened to get a job and become a journalist, the people who aspired for it,

01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:56.840
[Guest]: trained for it, they are better writers, but there may be greater heartburns because they

01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:59.920
[Guest]: are better writers and their numbers are high.

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:05.380
[Guest]: So they compete with each other, younger people get chances to cover international cricket.

01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:07.760
[Guest]: So maybe that is there.

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:13.360
[Guest]: But at the same time, for me to say that in our times, things were wonderful would be

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:20.200
[Guest]: very wrong, wrong perception or wrong, convey a wrong, wrong thing.

01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:21.200
[Guest]: No, it wasn't.

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.200
[Guest]: It wasn't.

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:27.080
[Guest]: People were, we were all like upset all the time, like, look, we don't get chances.

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:32.200
[Guest]: I would get a chance to cover a Ranji game outside Punjab because Faridabad happened

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:35.440
[Guest]: to be in Haryana, but though close to Delhi.

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:41.920
[Guest]: So even going to Faridabad, my getting a Ranji game was a big deal for me.

01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:47.080
[Amit Varma]: And there's another beautiful passage I want to read out from sort of from your book, where

01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:53.920
[Amit Varma]: you write, quote, until the 80s, publications use metal typesetting, the operator or typesetter

01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:57.680
[Amit Varma]: keyed in the stories from the journalist typed copy with editing marks.

01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:02.600
[Amit Varma]: The Linotype machine created a mold of each line of type using lead, and these were assembled

01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:07.120
[Amit Varma]: into the various pages of the newspaper by a page maker, a specialised job under the

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:09.880
[Amit Varma]: supervision of the subeditor or the chief subeditor.

01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:12.920
[Amit Varma]: It was a difficult job, but it was made to look easy by this skill.

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:17.080
[Amit Varma]: From today's perspective, where technology has made the job so easy that the same person

01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:22.400
[Amit Varma]: can write, edit and make the page, the work these guys were doing seems impossibly hard.

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:26.200
[Amit Varma]: The monotony of editing a piece, giving it a headline, then proofreading the manually

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:32.040
[Amit Varma]: typeset copy, and finally supervising the page making would take about 10 to eight hours,

01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:33.040
[Amit Varma]: stop code.

01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:37.280
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not reading this out only out of a sense of nostalgia or to tell people today

01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:40.080
[Amit Varma]: that hey, you have it so easy and all of that.

01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:48.080
[Amit Varma]: But I also want to sort of then think about how the process shapes the work that you do.

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:54.360
[Amit Varma]: Like I think the big advantage of say, being able to sit down and just type out a report

01:46:54.360 --> 01:47:01.080
[Amit Varma]: and hit enter and it is published immediately and people can read it means a number of different

01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:07.000
[Amit Varma]: things where on the negative side of the ledger, it means that you don't perhaps take as much

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.920
[Amit Varma]: care as you normally would, if you were, you know, going through this entire process, writing

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:14.880
[Amit Varma]: one piece in eight days, and all of that.

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.360
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, on the positive side of the ledger, what it means is that you're

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:23.120
[Amit Varma]: getting much more writing done, all these little points of friction have vanished, you

01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:26.960
[Amit Varma]: can just focus on the actual craft of the writing or the storytelling.

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:31.800
[Amit Varma]: And because you're getting much more of it, you're getting better at it much faster.

01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:36.080
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's kind of, it's just something that I think about that, you know, when I

01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:40.200
[Amit Varma]: first started writing, it was by hand, and then I used a typewriter for a little while

01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:42.760
[Amit Varma]: and then computers happened.

01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:47.640
[Amit Varma]: But to me, it seems there are different processes, when I'm writing by hand, you know, it is

01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:51.600
[Amit Varma]: much slower, it can't go at the speed of my thought.

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:56.200
[Amit Varma]: When I'm writing by a typewriter, there is still a consideration that has to go into

01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.200
[Amit Varma]: it.

01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:59.560
[Amit Varma]: Because there is no backspace.

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:04.220
[Amit Varma]: If I make a typo, or I change my mind, I can't just backspace it and write it again.

01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:06.440
[Amit Varma]: The computer is a different process.

01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:11.040
[Amit Varma]: You've been through all of this from writing with hand by typing stuff and somehow finding

01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:19.120
[Amit Varma]: a place, whatever, you know, all the technologies, do you feel that the process itself also then

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:22.720
[Amit Varma]: changes the kind of work that you're able to do?

01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:28.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, just in terms of something is more considered and thoughtful, or something can

01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:32.200
[Amit Varma]: be longer, for example, when you're writing for the internet, the great advantage is the

01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:37.520
[Amit Varma]: advantage of space, you don't have to be four paragraphs or five paragraphs or a Robinson,

01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:40.320
[Amit Varma]: you can be longer if you feel it justified.

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:44.880
[Amit Varma]: So what are your thoughts on the different ways in which form has evolved and how that's

01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:46.680
[Amit Varma]: affected your work?

01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:52.160
[Guest]: Well, I think human beings have great capacity to adapt.

01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:59.000
[Guest]: I mean, if I look back and reflect on your question, which I have done earlier, also,

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:04.480
[Guest]: I also used began by writing with hand I was not I, I learned once I got the job, I learned

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:10.080
[Guest]: a bit of typing in a typing school, but I think there is this lazy dog runs over the

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:18.200
[Guest]: which in which you can like all the keys, your 10 fingers use all the keys.

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:24.360
[Guest]: Typing I mean, at that time, one didn't think this as a disadvantage when one was doing

01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.360
[Guest]: it.

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:31.080
[Guest]: But now looking back, obviously, typing has this huge disadvantage of not whatever you

01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:38.320
[Guest]: have written, unless you change it, I mean, throw the paper and insert the paper if you

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:41.760
[Guest]: have made mistakes, or if you think no, the chain of thought is not okay.

01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:46.640
[Guest]: See, the computer has this huge advantage of you can write first, and then readjust

01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:53.680
[Guest]: paragraphs which were or redo them also, which is not possible while you were typing.

01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:58.880
[Guest]: But that also meant that subconsciously, since you're aware that you can't afford to make

01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:04.880
[Guest]: mistakes, you were more attentive to you were more because you know, you know that look,

01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:08.240
[Guest]: it will be difficult for me to now I finished one page.

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:14.080
[Guest]: So let me be more thoughtful, let me think a bit more seriously before I start typing.

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:20.600
[Guest]: So I guess that training because of the requirement of what you're doing, because you can't keep

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:25.880
[Guest]: on throwing papers and it takes time and journalism is what it's like you have to meet a deadline.

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.920
[Guest]: It's a work in a hurry.

01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:31.440
[Guest]: So yes, I think today's people have this great advantage.

01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:36.560
[Guest]: I have this great advantage now if I write anything and it happened in I think the first

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:45.040
[Guest]: time I used a laptop was I think in for England tour in 96.

01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:48.960
[Guest]: You had you sold your car to buy a laptop, you've mentioned that was in 97.

01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:53.120
[Guest]: So here was this office laptop, I was in Express at that time.

01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:56.840
[Guest]: And that's the first time and it was it was a wonder machine.

01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:00.200
[Guest]: I mean, you would wonder that look, I can do anything.

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:05.480
[Guest]: I can like write a para and change it and without bothering about the typewriter, it

01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:12.640
[Guest]: will make less noise also it look mostly can and it saved a lot of time and at the same

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:18.600
[Guest]: time since you were at such later age in the early 40s being introduced to a technology

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:22.920
[Guest]: which was widely different from your typewriter.

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:26.960
[Guest]: Typewriter was like a metallic machine which could pick up and throw laptop or something

01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:36.160
[Guest]: which was which was so precise and so I mean, technically like no you felt that you have

01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:41.960
[Guest]: to safeguard it and you're fearful also I would I remember that one would press a button

01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:48.360
[Guest]: and say press the wrong button, the delete, we were not used to it, copies would vanish,

01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:49.760
[Guest]: then you would be in panic.

01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:54.200
[Guest]: So you'd always key in with a lot of fear that nothing should go wrong.

01:51:54.200 --> 01:52:00.200
[Guest]: The copy shouldn't vanish, it happened with me a couple of times, you've written a report.

01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:06.560
[Guest]: And obviously, now I know I'm much more technical, technically, laptop is likely using a typewriter

01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:07.560
[Guest]: now.

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:12.320
[Guest]: So I knew I used to press say, delete, undo, not undo.

01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:17.000
[Guest]: So you frantically search for some expert to tell you what to do, what not to do.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:24.000
[Guest]: But yes, your writing skills obviously would be better, better because you spend less time

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.160
[Guest]: but do more.

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:27.160
[Guest]: It has changed.

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.160
[Guest]: It has changed.

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:32.000
[Guest]: But at the same time, I am saying that when you look back at people who have written at

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.920
[Guest]: that period, I'm sure if they were using laptop also the language would have been the same

01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:41.280
[Guest]: because language is as you are saying, product of the times we live in.

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:44.160
[Guest]: It's not as if their language would have changed.

01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:51.480
[Guest]: Maybe they might have become written more carefully with less attention but more care

01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:54.880
[Guest]: because you have time, you can do faster.

01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:55.880
[Guest]: But we adapt.

01:52:55.880 --> 01:53:00.760
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, when you talk about your wonder at seeing how a laptop functions, and I totally

01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:05.320
[Amit Varma]: shared that, I think of this quote by Arthur C. Clarke, where he said, quote, any sufficiently

01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:09.200
[Amit Varma]: advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, right?

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:13.300
[Amit Varma]: And that's how it seemed to us that, you know, and, you know, you mentioned in your book

01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:17.160
[Amit Varma]: about how in 97, I think when you were in the Pioneer, you needed a laptop to go on

01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:21.720
[Amit Varma]: this tour, and you actually you needed 30,000 rupees, you had to sell your car to, you know,

01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:22.720
[Amit Varma]: raise the money for it.

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:26.120
[Amit Varma]: And I remember around that time, perhaps, and I wasn't a journalist, of course, I was

01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:31.320
[Amit Varma]: working as a scriptwriter in television, but I badly wanted a laptop as well.

01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:35.600
[Amit Varma]: Because in my office, I didn't have access to, you know, access to computers was not

01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:36.600
[Amit Varma]: so smooth.

01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:40.880
[Amit Varma]: I worked in channel V at the time, I remember, and we just had sort of one computer in the

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:41.880
[Amit Varma]: entire office.

01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:43.620
[Amit Varma]: And it wasn't with the scriptwriters.

01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:48.520
[Amit Varma]: It was with the PR department, you know, and we had to, there was this big political fight

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:52.760
[Amit Varma]: that we, you know, wanted to use it, but they would be very possessive of it.

01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:57.280
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, so and something that we take so completely for granted today, like I cannot

01:53:57.280 --> 01:54:00.600
[Amit Varma]: imagine sort of life without it.

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:06.480
[Amit Varma]: Now, what's what you earlier sort of said, which I found really interesting is that you

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:12.800
[Amit Varma]: were sort of not someone who was very outgoing, kind of, you know, kept to yourself and all

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:15.120
[Amit Varma]: of that, until you started drinking.

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:18.840
[Amit Varma]: And in your book, you have, you know, you talk about the sort of the cocktail parties

01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:22.280
[Amit Varma]: that would happen with the press conferences and all of that.

01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:28.880
[Amit Varma]: And there's this one hilarious story, in fact, which I really enjoyed about how, you know,

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:35.320
[Amit Varma]: in one of those parties, there is a guy who doesn't drink, a colleague who doesn't drink,

01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:39.800
[Amit Varma]: who you find is on his sixth Bloody Mary.

01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:45.760
[Amit Varma]: And then you go to him and he says, yeah, Pradeep, this is fantastic tomato juice.

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:51.520
[Amit Varma]: And I was also struck by this passage there, which I'll read out, where you say, quote,

01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:55.440
[Amit Varma]: with most of the journalists having several drinks, one would think that the next day's

01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:58.560
[Amit Varma]: reports would have had factual inaccuracies.

01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:01.880
[Amit Varma]: But this was rarely the case, or at least we believed so.

01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:06.120
[Amit Varma]: Most of us had become experts at decoding match details from the scorecard, with live

01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:11.080
[Amit Varma]: television coverage not reaching every home, and in any case absent from the games we covered,

01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:16.360
[Amit Varma]: the facts were what we wrote on in the paper, even if on occasion, they may have been at

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:19.320
[Amit Varma]: variance with reality, stop quote.

01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:23.400
[Amit Varma]: And this also tells me like, you know, there was this Wisdom, of course, published almanacs,

01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:28.400
[Amit Varma]: but they also published something called the Wisdom Book of Test Cricket in I think, 77-78.

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:31.000
[Amit Varma]: And my dad got us a copy of that.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.440
[Amit Varma]: And it had all the Test Match scorecards until then.

01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:36.640
[Amit Varma]: Of course, in that time, there weren't even that many Test Matches, so they could fit

01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:38.000
[Amit Varma]: in one book.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:43.960
[Amit Varma]: And I remember that one of my favorite activities was to sit there and go scorecard by scorecard

01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:49.080
[Amit Varma]: and make stories in my head from whatever I could decipher from this thing.

01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:53.280
[Amit Varma]: So that sense of, you know, you're doing that from the scorecard also, I mean, that's how

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:55.880
[Amit Varma]: we consume cricket at one point in time, right?

01:55:55.880 --> 01:56:00.160
[Amit Varma]: There was no TV, no YouTube, no reports for most of those matches.

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:01.600
[Amit Varma]: That's what we did.

01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:08.440
[Amit Varma]: But the question, therefore, is that how like one of the things that you used to be very

01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:12.200
[Amit Varma]: disquieting for me when I was a journalist, the first thing I noticed as a young journalist

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:16.480
[Amit Varma]: in the press box, is that most of the people are not watching the cricket.

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:19.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, kabhi kuch aawaz aayegi toh they might look at the replay, but most of the

01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:21.200
[Amit Varma]: people are not watching the cricket.

01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:24.480
[Amit Varma]: And I remember discussing this with a colleague that are we are cricket journalists, we're

01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:28.440
[Amit Varma]: not even like kind of watching the game, right?

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:33.120
[Amit Varma]: And is this something that you saw and that you noticed because a lot of the journalism

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:40.160
[Amit Varma]: in a sense, then becomes kind of lazy where you, you know, ki shortcut le liya ki, you

01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:44.000
[Amit Varma]: know, scorecard se you kind of figure out what happened and then you make up stuff around

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.000
[Amit Varma]: it.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.280
[Amit Varma]: Like even that earlier example, R Sreeman walking into the Ramnathan Krishnan versus

01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:52.480
[Amit Varma]: Ramesh Krishnan match and you point out that he missed most of the match, but he put together

01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:57.440
[Amit Varma]: a report with a lot of flowery prose and with a lot of whatever from the bare facts without

01:56:57.440 --> 01:56:59.440
[Amit Varma]: actually immersing himself.

01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:03.640
[Amit Varma]: Is this a danger that journalists face that you become jaded?

01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:07.360
[Amit Varma]: So you stop watching because initially, I guess, excitement bahut hai, you're watching

01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:11.120
[Amit Varma]: every ball you're trying to maybe you're too excited, trying too hard to find narratives

01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:12.400
[Amit Varma]: and stories in there.

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:16.640
[Amit Varma]: But is there a danger that later you get jaded, and you're just going through the motions

01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:20.240
[Amit Varma]: and like these are the two sort of extremes you can go to?

01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:26.720
[Guest]: Yeah, there is a danger I thought about writing about all these things about drinking about

01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:35.280
[Guest]: I mean, I wanted to convey a picture of journalism, which was more truthful than this fancy dream

01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:41.720
[Guest]: world you create that look, we worked hard and we knew the game and we were passionate

01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:42.720
[Guest]: about it.

01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:47.200
[Guest]: At least my experience, I'm narrating my experience, I'm not saying they weren't there.

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:52.160
[Guest]: In my experience, also, there were journalists who even then they were young, but probably

01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:59.040
[Guest]: they didn't, they were there to they got a job and maybe they got a job like I did.

01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:05.920
[Guest]: And then they were now not, not understanding the game or not working to understand the

01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:07.200
[Guest]: game.

01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:08.200
[Guest]: They would write cliches.

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:13.480
[Guest]: You see, when you write a match report from scorecard, you will write in cliches, no caught

01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:24.240
[Guest]: behind, edged, slip a catch, edge, cover, mistime, you create a story out of cliches.

01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:29.640
[Guest]: And since nobody is there to, today's reader, if you make mistakes in a print report of

01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:35.560
[Guest]: a match will kill you, they'll write to your editor and you because they've seen the match,

01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:37.800
[Guest]: they're saying what rubbish this man is.

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:44.880
[Guest]: In our time, that was a luxury, which not everyone took advantage of that luxury in

01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:48.000
[Guest]: the sense that okay, kya farag padta nahi, dekha dekha.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.720
[Guest]: And then if you are in press boxes, where drinks are being served, where that reporter

01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:59.400
[Guest]: like the moment he realized that his tomato juice was laced with vodka, he suddenly felt

01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:04.320
[Guest]: giddy and said, yo, I'm going home, I'll sleep because he realized that he may not be able

01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:09.800
[Guest]: to write the report and he'll sleep properly and then make a report from the scorecard.

01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:18.560
[Guest]: So this is a kind of dishonesty, which was prevalent of the specific periods I was involved

01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:22.480
[Guest]: with in Chandigarh, which I may have also been guilty of.

01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:29.040
[Guest]: My advantage was that I, unlike a lot of the others, I at least had played the game, even

01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:35.600
[Guest]: if it was at a college level, I could instinctively at least basic errors I wouldn't make.

01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:40.920
[Guest]: I mean, there are things which instinctively if you understand and know a game, you won't

01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:46.340
[Guest]: make that mistake of, you know, it will register even if you're not watching it very carefully.

01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:47.860
[Guest]: But it was wrong.

01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:53.240
[Guest]: And yes, the danger of jadedness is, I have always wondered and especially wondered at

01:59:53.240 --> 02:00:00.600
[Guest]: people who have, I used to, remained as cricket writers for 30-40 years, and I would marvel

02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:07.040
[Guest]: at their capacity to have that concentration, that passion to watch a game carefully, because

02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:08.960
[Guest]: there are people who do that.

02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:13.600
[Guest]: I mean, I'm writing of, it's not like as if everyone is doing that.

02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:15.440
[Guest]: I'm just writing of a specific period.

02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:21.480
[Guest]: But there are wonderful writers who, even at later ages, you watch them, you just admire,

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:27.220
[Guest]: they just sit in the press box and keep on watching, and till the end, they don't move.

02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:33.240
[Guest]: But there are people who get jaded, and they get so jaded that it's like, like they're

02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:35.160
[Guest]: bored with.

02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:39.400
[Guest]: The problem with doing something every day is that you get bored with that work.

02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:44.360
[Guest]: And once you get bored with that work, you might take shortcuts, so it's okay, we'll

02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:48.520
[Guest]: watch the replay, we'll ask someone, I'll trust someone.

02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:52.360
[Guest]: The most you can do is, if you're clever and this thing, you will ask a person whom you

02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:55.080
[Guest]: know has watched and understands the game.

02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:59.520
[Guest]: You won't make the mistake of asking someone who, like you, hasn't watched also and doesn't

02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:00.760
[Guest]: even understand the game.

02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:04.640
[Guest]: At least you will do that to trust a person, you know that when you're writing, you won't

02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:05.640
[Guest]: make a mistake.

02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:08.760
[Guest]: But there is this, a lot of people get jaded.

02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:14.680
[Guest]: I got jaded far early in my writing, because somehow maybe I was interested in so many

02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:17.400
[Guest]: other things.

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:22.640
[Guest]: I mean, cricket wasn't for me, since I had just stayed into journalism.

02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:26.760
[Guest]: Maybe cricket writing wasn't for me that be end of everything.

02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:35.460
[Guest]: So I was interested in doing so many other things or that I got bored with match reports

02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:37.920
[Guest]: very early in my life.

02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:41.840
[Amit Varma]: But one thing that you seem never to have got bored with and that I think you did very

02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:45.800
[Amit Varma]: well from what I remember of your journalism and what I see in the book are other human

02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:53.360
[Amit Varma]: stories of actually talking to cricketers, the profiles that, you know, there you were,

02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:55.480
[Amit Varma]: there's a much sort of greater engagement.

02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:59.240
[Amit Varma]: So did that always, did that side of it always interest you?

02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:05.960
[Guest]: And then I think I was probably more interested in understanding human nature and understanding.

02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:11.040
[Guest]: And if you see in the book, my interactions with some of the top cricketers of that period,

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:15.840
[Guest]: which were common to people who are covering at that time, because the accessibility was

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:18.640
[Guest]: far greater, it was nothing special to me.

02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:26.440
[Guest]: But I think I since I was more interested in a in human nature, be in not, not idealizing

02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:32.520
[Guest]: cricketers like like the danger of being in journalism is that you, you basically you

02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:33.760
[Guest]: are a fan.

02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:39.040
[Guest]: You can't deny the fact that no matter how much you say that, no, I'm here as a professional,

02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:44.960
[Guest]: we are fans, you know, we admire those skills, we, so beating a Tendulkar itself becomes

02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:49.440
[Guest]: an event, whatever, whoever you may be, you may think you are a journalist, I keep my

02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.440
[Guest]: distance.

02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:59.760
[Guest]: I somehow very early in my life, lost that idealizing capacity, somehow, because I saw

02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:10.640
[Guest]: them as as human beings, and I was more forthright and more like treating them like as equals,

02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:18.960
[Guest]: which probably might have helped me in reconstructing those era because I write about say Ganguly

02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:26.560
[Guest]: Dravid interactions or Chappell era, I see it from every perspective, I see it from Dravids,

02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:33.640
[Guest]: I see from Ganguly, I even become a mediator kind of a thing I like, like maybe, maybe

02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:39.120
[Guest]: my own distance from them, I would never, despite having known them in the sense that

02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:42.360
[Guest]: if you read the book, it appear as if I was in friendly terms with them.

02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:43.640
[Guest]: It wasn't like that.

02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:45.200
[Guest]: I would keep my distance.

02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:53.120
[Guest]: I would hardly like, no, try to see a lot of journalists try to follow a cricketer follow

02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:57.520
[Guest]: a captain, seek his court, see his exclusive, keep on troubling him, give me an interview,

02:03:57.520 --> 02:03:59.280
[Guest]: give me, I would never do that.

02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:04.440
[Guest]: So maybe that helped me that whenever I approached them, they would take me a bit more seriously

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:12.480
[Guest]: than look, maybe my grey hair helped, because it's been grey since the last 30 years.

02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:21.880
[Guest]: So I think maybe my training in a bit of English literature, my own, I was a great follower

02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:24.080
[Guest]: of cinema.

02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:28.760
[Guest]: I think one of the biggest influences on me when I was in the university was watching

02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:35.360
[Guest]: Kurosawa's Rashomon Gate, I suddenly I couldn't sleep for days, because I suddenly realized

02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:40.380
[Guest]: that, that to believe that there is one truth.

02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:43.920
[Guest]: And here is this film showing you multiple truths and even then you don't know what the

02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:45.920
[Guest]: truth is.

02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:51.840
[Guest]: I mean, the same incident seen from say, four or five perspectives, and all the five perspectives

02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:56.960
[Guest]: are different, the people, the person who's narrating that story becomes the hero in that

02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:01.760
[Guest]: the saviour in that, or a good person, the rest are villains.

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:07.880
[Guest]: So everyone is a villain from multiple perspectives, and everyone is a hero.

02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:10.960
[Guest]: So it disturbed me so much.

02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:16.560
[Amit Varma]: And I actually caught a glimpse of this in, you know, when you write about what is happening

02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:21.480
[Amit Varma]: between Dravid and Ganguly, for example, that Rashomon effect really comes in, because we

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:23.360
[Amit Varma]: are getting it from both sides, right?

02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:27.240
[Amit Varma]: You're speaking to Ganguly, and you're speaking to Dravid, and you're getting all the different

02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:32.640
[Amit Varma]: points of view in there, which I found was sort of beautifully done.

02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:36.800
[Amit Varma]: And you know, we'll, we'll, of course, talk about those sort of as well.

02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:40.880
[Amit Varma]: But a follow up question on this, which is that, in your case, you're talking to both

02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:44.000
[Amit Varma]: Ganguly and Dravid, and you're getting all those points of views, and you know, everybody

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.040
[Amit Varma]: and you're making that effort.

02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:52.920
[Amit Varma]: But in many cases, I feel that access and what it can get you is a double edged sword.

02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:56.240
[Amit Varma]: Because on the one hand, you're getting insider dope, which you have no other way of knowing.

02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:59.920
[Amit Varma]: So you're getting a deeper insight into what's actually happening.

02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:03.600
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, the incentives of access are that you don't want to piss off the person

02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:05.080
[Amit Varma]: who's given you access.

02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:08.760
[Amit Varma]: Because if you lose that access, you know, you are one step behind your competitors who

02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:10.920
[Amit Varma]: might be able to talk to the person.

02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:16.080
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, you know, that can become a factor for some journalists where you can't

02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:19.120
[Amit Varma]: then piss them off too much, your coverage has to be dictated by that.

02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:23.640
[Amit Varma]: Like at one point, you're right in the 90s, that you were a little disheartened when Azhar

02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:28.960
[Amit Varma]: was captain that Azhar only spoke to the small coterie of people around him.

02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:34.360
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, I remember in 2006, when we had gone to Pakistan, I was sort of blogging also

02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:37.960
[Amit Varma]: at the same time while I was writing for the Guardian and so on.

02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:41.760
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things I blogged about was a Politburo and the Politburo was of course,

02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:44.880
[Amit Varma]: a group of Bengali journalists who had access to Ganguly.

02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:48.440
[Amit Varma]: And every story they would write would be from, you know, keeping Ganguly's interests

02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:49.440
[Amit Varma]: in mind.

02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:53.080
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I remember a couple of them glaring at me and giving me angry looks at

02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:54.680
[Amit Varma]: one point in time.

02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:58.520
[Amit Varma]: But that aside, I think, what do you feel about these trade offs?

02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:02.360
[Amit Varma]: And if there are young journalists listening to this, how should they navigate these trade

02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:03.360
[Amit Varma]: offs?

02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:05.560
[Amit Varma]: Because on the one hand, it's good to get close to the subject.

02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:07.300
[Amit Varma]: So you get insider info.

02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:10.520
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, one, that access is always conditional.

02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:16.240
[Amit Varma]: And two, that access can bias you, you know, even if it is not, the access isn't conditional,

02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:20.560
[Amit Varma]: because you're close to one person, you will subconsciously get biased towards that point

02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:21.560
[Amit Varma]: of view.

02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:26.480
[Amit Varma]: So what would your advice be to a young journalist and as an as a journalist yourself and as

02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:31.640
[Amit Varma]: an editor supervising so many other journalists writing for you, how do you think this is

02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:33.360
[Amit Varma]: best navigated?

02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:38.160
[Guest]: I think the first lesson to be learned is to stop being a fan.

02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:39.160
[Guest]: Try stop being a fan.

02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:42.560
[Guest]: I'm saying that it's difficult because you are a fan.

02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:45.520
[Guest]: That's why you come into the profession, you know.

02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:46.520
[Guest]: Stop being a fan.

02:07:46.520 --> 02:07:49.520
[Guest]: Tell yourself that you're dealing with the skills of these players.

02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:53.240
[Guest]: Otherwise, they will, as human beings, they may be as good or bad.

02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:57.720
[Guest]: They have a discipline in one, this thing, their skills are great in that discipline,

02:07:57.720 --> 02:08:00.640
[Guest]: they become great players.

02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:07.960
[Guest]: Second thing, this access, it's a very tricky thing because your newspaper, especially today's

02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:13.320
[Guest]: newspapers or television, they demand access because you want to break stories.

02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:19.520
[Guest]: Now access comes with this baggage of, then you have to, you become biased.

02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:22.840
[Guest]: You have to please that person because otherwise he won't give you access.

02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:24.680
[Guest]: Now, what do you do?

02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:31.320
[Guest]: In my period, especially till the large chunk, even when I retired, maybe because I had been

02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:36.120
[Guest]: part of the, when print was the king, I mean, print word meant everything.

02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:38.080
[Guest]: There was a time when there was no TV.

02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:46.120
[Guest]: So players used to rely on the print or selectors and everything to find out or to use the print

02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:50.600
[Guest]: writing to even further their agenda.

02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:55.520
[Guest]: Like this fellow, if they didn't like a player, say, you wrote in the report, you didn't play

02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:56.520
[Guest]: well.

02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:01.280
[Guest]: So, in my case, I learned my lesson early, which I describe in the book also, Kapil gives

02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:05.840
[Guest]: me a big interview and then denies it later.

02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:11.440
[Guest]: I was a young rookie reporter, it hurts my professional credibility.

02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:14.640
[Guest]: But I also realized that don't be close to players.

02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:18.000
[Guest]: I went to the other extreme at that time and I could do that.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:23.520
[Guest]: I stopped being interacting with any player.

02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:31.400
[Guest]: I mean, this kind of a thing went on till, I mean, interact with a captain or a player

02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:35.360
[Guest]: only if it is strictly required at a professional level.

02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:42.600
[Guest]: Otherwise, no, this thing that you like try to ingratiate yourself to him so that you

02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:46.920
[Guest]: can get good stories or I stopped doing that.

02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:50.040
[Guest]: It had its pitfalls, but somehow I survived.

02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:57.440
[Guest]: I think another lesson which is very important to learn is you have to be good at your work.

02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:03.320
[Guest]: I mean, the subject you're writing on, you have to be so good that even the people whom

02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:09.200
[Guest]: you're writing about, look forward to reading you.

02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:14.040
[Guest]: I mean, if you can do that, I mean, that's why you are in the profession, you are not

02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:20.760
[Guest]: just writing for a reader, you are also writing for people who are playing that game.

02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:24.720
[Guest]: They also like, they would also want to know what they have written.

02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:32.600
[Guest]: And if your judgment of a game or of a player skills or of that day's innings or of a spell

02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:40.840
[Guest]: is very close to what has happened from technical point of view, from the situation the match

02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:47.040
[Guest]: is placed in, even the player, even if you have been critical of him, realizes that this

02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:53.120
[Guest]: person is not coming from a perspective of bias.

02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:55.760
[Guest]: He may even want to read it every day.

02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:58.480
[Guest]: I want to read this man, what has he written about me?

02:10:58.480 --> 02:10:59.480
[Guest]: What has he written about?

02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:01.680
[Guest]: He may be learning from your writing.

02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:07.720
[Guest]: If you can reach that stage, I mean, you get a different respect from those people.

02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:14.920
[Guest]: Because they also, I mean, like their craft, you are also dealing with one craft.

02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:20.840
[Guest]: So if you can become in that craft as good as the players are in their craft, you will

02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:26.680
[Guest]: have a lot of respect, you will have, people will talk to you, even if you have been critical

02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:27.680
[Guest]: to.

02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:34.960
[Guest]: I don't think there have been many journalists as critical of the establishment or even of

02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:41.640
[Guest]: players as, I'm not like trying to praise myself, like it's not, I'm not coming from

02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:42.640
[Guest]: that perspective.

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:46.720
[Guest]: But I have been a very, very, my opinions may have been wrong.

02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:49.080
[Guest]: People may have said, what nonsense is he writing?

02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:51.200
[Guest]: But there have been strong opinions.

02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:57.240
[Guest]: Yet I have never been denied access by, as this book bears testimony to.

02:11:57.240 --> 02:12:02.560
[Guest]: I remember one of the best compliments I think I was ever given was the one of the members

02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:10.960
[Guest]: of the Politburo, wonderful word you coined for the clique.

02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:18.560
[Guest]: So in West Indies, when World Cup 2007, when I write in the book that I call up Dravid

02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:24.600
[Guest]: to wish him best of luck against the Sri Lanka match, because I had almost envisaged that

02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:27.360
[Guest]: we are going to lose because the team was in a disarray.

02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:33.640
[Guest]: This member of the Politburo meets me and he says that the only journalist in India

02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:42.320
[Guest]: today whom both Dravid and Ganguly talked to, I thought it was, it's a great compliment.

02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:46.440
[Guest]: Because there were camps and there were some journalists in one camp, some journalists

02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:47.720
[Guest]: in other camp.

02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:54.720
[Guest]: And if I could manage to create this, even this impression among the reporters, especially

02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:01.600
[Guest]: among the Politburo member, that's not only Sourav who interacts with him, even Dravid

02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:05.000
[Guest]: interacts with him.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.320
[Amit Varma]: That is a fabulous compliment.

02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:10.760
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, that whole Nagpur incident, you know, you've narrated it so well from both

02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:14.360
[Amit Varma]: points of view, which, which I, because you're speaking to both the players.

02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:17.920
[Amit Varma]: So you're getting the inside view from both, you know, what Ganguly thinks about it and

02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:19.680
[Amit Varma]: what Dravid is saying is happening.

02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:24.280
[Amit Varma]: I thought it was great to sort of, I mean, I was an active journalist at the time I was,

02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:26.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, covering, you know, I was in journalism.

02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:30.960
[Amit Varma]: So I kind of knew a lot of what had happened, but you've given this inside view from both

02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:35.240
[Amit Varma]: the Ganguly and the Dravid point of view from both the horse's mouth, as it were, which

02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:36.240
[Amit Varma]: I liked.

02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:40.760
[Amit Varma]: And there's another bit where you talk about how, despite criticism, they still remain

02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:45.800
[Amit Varma]: friends where you write, and I'll quote this paragraph you write about Mr. Bedi, where

02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:50.040
[Amit Varma]: you say, quote, I remember doing a critical story on him in which I wrote that Bedi needed

02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:54.440
[Amit Varma]: to be present in Punjab to see its cricket structure firsthand, if he was to understand

02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:56.200
[Amit Varma]: what was needed for improvements.

02:13:56.200 --> 02:14:01.160
[Amit Varma]: This is when he was Punjab cricket coach, by the way, I also hinted that some wrong selections

02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:04.520
[Amit Varma]: were being made because Bedi was misled by Punjab officials.

02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:09.000
[Amit Varma]: The morning my story appeared, Bedi barged into my room, turned his backside towards

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:14.680
[Amit Varma]: me, bent over, and in a tone more sarcastic than bitter, said in the crudest of Punjabi,

02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:21.200
[Amit Varma]: Mar lo, jinne maane hain mar lo, and then you translate that stop code, which I found

02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:22.200
[Amit Varma]: so charming.

02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:26.120
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, he's still your friend to this day and all that you have that sort of affection

02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:31.680
[Amit Varma]: and that's really you and that only you're right just comes with doing your work so well

02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:36.680
[Amit Varma]: that they sort of respect you for that alone.

02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:45.240
[Amit Varma]: My next question is about how just what a cricket writer is doing or what they are supposed

02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:46.240
[Amit Varma]: to do.

02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:48.440
[Amit Varma]: The brief of that itself has changed.

02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:52.280
[Amit Varma]: And it changed in a very big way with the television era, because before the television

02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:57.240
[Amit Varma]: era happens, you're writing a match report where you have to describe events, what happened

02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:01.500
[Amit Varma]: today, you know, that is what the reader wants to know, because the reader has no idea.

02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:02.500
[Amit Varma]: And that's your job.

02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:07.280
[Amit Varma]: It's a that is a narrative, it's it's sequential, and it's like these other things that happened

02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:08.640
[Amit Varma]: in the day split.

02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Once television comes on, and a significant chunk, at least for international matches,

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.920
[Amit Varma]: a significant chunk of your audience knows what happened.

02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:19.520
[Amit Varma]: They have the narrative, and especially more acute today, when they know what happened

02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:24.480
[Amit Varma]: in real time on the internet, the brief of the writer obviously changes.

02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:28.400
[Amit Varma]: So now you no longer have to do a linear description of what happened.

02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:31.000
[Amit Varma]: Instead, you pick some other narrative within the day.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:36.240
[Amit Varma]: So maybe there is some engrossing battle with a spinner bowling five maidens to a particularly

02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:37.240
[Amit Varma]: patient batsman.

02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:42.640
[Amit Varma]: And that can become your dramatic arc for the day, or you find other dramatic arcs,

02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:46.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, within within the day, like, you know, to take a dramatic arc from a match

02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:51.340
[Amit Varma]: in an earlier generation in your book, you write about how in 1974, when the Indian cricket

02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:56.060
[Amit Varma]: team played there, you know, an entire day would go by when Wadikar is not even talking

02:15:56.060 --> 02:15:57.760
[Amit Varma]: to his spinners, right?

02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:01.480
[Amit Varma]: Because of how relations are, and that's a dramatic narrative arc.

02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:06.280
[Amit Varma]: And what I and I, of course, sort of joint cricket journalism at a point where it's very

02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:11.320
[Amit Varma]: much shifted already, where, you know, we would do what we would call a bulletin, which

02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:14.480
[Amit Varma]: is the linear report, but we'd have other things around it.

02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:19.140
[Amit Varma]: And even within the linear report, it's just you don't just have to do event, event, event,

02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:21.000
[Amit Varma]: you can look at larger things.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:25.360
[Amit Varma]: And I would think that this not only changes the reports themselves, which is trivial,

02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:31.640
[Amit Varma]: of course, it does, but it also changes the way that cricket writers now watch cricket,

02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:35.920
[Amit Varma]: where they are not watching, because they have to cover the events which happen and

02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:37.120
[Amit Varma]: write them down.

02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:40.400
[Amit Varma]: But they're watching at a different meta level where they're looking for these stories where

02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:42.520
[Amit Varma]: they're looking for these other angles.

02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:47.800
[Amit Varma]: Now, given that you really straddle these eras, you know, you straddle the pre television

02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:52.200
[Amit Varma]: era, and then you will post television era and you were an editor yourself guiding so

02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:57.320
[Amit Varma]: many writers, do you think that that changes the way you watch cricket to begin with, that

02:16:57.320 --> 02:16:59.440
[Amit Varma]: your imperatives change?

02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:02.620
[Amit Varma]: And you know, so give me a sense of what this evolution has been.

02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:06.640
[Amit Varma]: Because I actually, you know, left cricket journalism in 2008, 2009.

02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:11.780
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sure it's evolved a lot even since then, because now there is just so much material

02:17:11.780 --> 02:17:15.440
[Amit Varma]: on the internet, everything is real time, and so on and so forth.

02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:17.800
[Amit Varma]: So give me a sense of the evolution of cricket writing.

02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:24.360
[Guest]: Well, I also left active reporting in 2007, that was my last event I covered was that

02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:25.360
[Guest]: World Cup.

02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:30.680
[Guest]: Apart from I went to see Ganguly's retirement match, because I thought he had promised also

02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:33.120
[Guest]: an interview and also I thought I'd watched his debut.

02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:34.120
[Guest]: So let me.

02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:39.120
[Guest]: Yeah, it has changed and it's changed dramatically.

02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:46.440
[Guest]: When I started match report was the only authentic document of what had happened of the day.

02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:51.520
[Guest]: So there was no recording of the event, either the match report or people who would have

02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:58.280
[Guest]: watched themselves live with television coming in, when people watching, so suddenly everyone

02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:02.040
[Guest]: would say that, look, why are you writing a match report?

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:08.600
[Guest]: Why you and especially those statistically oriented, boring match reports, where, what

02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:12.600
[Guest]: ball a four was hit, when was the maiden bold.

02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:14.800
[Guest]: So what do you do?

02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:19.480
[Guest]: You are not used to the new era has dawned in.

02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:23.600
[Guest]: People are watching you, you become almost redundant in a way.

02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:24.920
[Guest]: Now do you change your style?

02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:27.800
[Guest]: You have to change your style.

02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:34.120
[Guest]: Then you capture, as you say, these moments and build a narrative.

02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:37.240
[Guest]: And every report has to be readable in the first place.

02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:45.400
[Guest]: See what no matter what you write, the reader has to get engaged in it.

02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:52.560
[Guest]: I mean, why is the reader coming to your report is because he's interested in that game.

02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:56.120
[Guest]: He's coming to that.

02:18:56.120 --> 02:19:01.800
[Guest]: My thing to my reporters at that time was that, look, don't forget the fact that a match

02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:04.600
[Guest]: has there has been an event on the day.

02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:09.960
[Guest]: There are a lot of writers who forget the fact that they're writing about that day's

02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:15.240
[Guest]: play and they pick up one thing and write from beautifully written.

02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:19.920
[Guest]: I'm not saying that it's not beautifully written, but when you read from first line to end,

02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:21.600
[Guest]: you wonder what is it about?

02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:22.600
[Guest]: Oh, okay.

02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:24.440
[Guest]: I enjoyed reading it.

02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:32.160
[Guest]: So I would tell them that, look, develop the skill of weaving this moment with introduce

02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:34.260
[Guest]: the match also.

02:19:34.260 --> 02:19:39.120
[Guest]: I mean, this narrative shouldn't forget the fact that so-and-so has happened, a match

02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:44.640
[Guest]: is placed in the context, whether you need runs to win or the wicket is bad.

02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:46.700
[Guest]: So you bet it badly.

02:19:46.700 --> 02:19:52.400
[Guest]: So there is a past and a future likelihood, which don't forget that.

02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:56.120
[Guest]: But there are such wonderful writers these days.

02:19:56.120 --> 02:20:01.160
[Guest]: And I know one looks forward to even reading their that.

02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:08.800
[Guest]: But at the same time, I see a lot of young readers complaining that they read about it.

02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:12.360
[Guest]: But what is it about?

02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:17.880
[Guest]: So it's a difficult situation for a journalist.

02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:22.320
[Guest]: I think still British journalists still, I think, stick to the whole formula, do they?

02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:23.320
[Guest]: I think they do.

02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:29.400
[Amit Varma]: I haven't been reading recent cricket journalism, to be honest, I read a lot of football, but

02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:32.600
[Amit Varma]: I haven't, you know, so I go to the Guardian every day.

02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:34.880
[Amit Varma]: So what does the football reporter do internationally?

02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:35.880
[Amit Varma]: It sticks to?

02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:40.960
[Amit Varma]: No, I think the football reporter won't do a blow-by-blow analysis, they'll do a lot

02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:42.680
[Amit Varma]: of stuff around it.

02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:46.240
[Amit Varma]: And generally for every match, and this was a formula we used to follow, there'll be one

02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:50.880
[Amit Varma]: report, which is kind of a report, but not exactly linear, which can flow around, but

02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:52.360
[Amit Varma]: which is kind of a report.

02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:55.840
[Amit Varma]: And then there'll be other pieces on the match, which, you know, we look at other angles,

02:20:55.840 --> 02:20:58.360
[Guest]: colour pieces, comment pieces.

02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:03.320
[Guest]: It has an advantage that there is a scorecard, and if it is a detailed scorecard, you can

02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:06.420
[Guest]: get the sense of what has happened on the pitch.

02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:11.000
[Guest]: Then you can, around it, weave different stories.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:16.000
[Guest]: So that's why I think the present-day journalist has a much more difficult job to do, and his

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:25.760
[Guest]: writing skills have to be really, really good to engage his readers, his or her readers.

02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:31.040
[Guest]: And that's why he needs to be at the top of his subject as well as his craft.

02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:36.880
[Guest]: See, unless you are at the top of your subject, you understand your subject, you can't weave

02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:39.760
[Guest]: other stories also.

02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:44.200
[Guest]: Because it's through the understanding of your subject, you pick up those moments which

02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:48.760
[Guest]: you think are important and need to be described at length.

02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:50.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, absolutely.

02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:56.840
[Amit Varma]: And just thinking aloud again, what we earlier discussed about cricketers, that the ecosystem

02:21:56.840 --> 02:22:02.120
[Amit Varma]: is so much better, pedagogy and learning cricket is so much easier, and therefore, you have

02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:04.220
[Amit Varma]: much more depth in cricketers.

02:22:04.220 --> 02:22:07.600
[Amit Varma]: Would you say the same is true of cricket writers?

02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:12.960
[Guest]: Well, their writing skills are definitely better.

02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:15.240
[Guest]: I mean, I can see that.

02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:16.240
[Guest]: Everyone can see that.

02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:23.200
[Guest]: Yes, they're, see, it's easier, they're better trained, far better trained than I ever was.

02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:24.680
[Guest]: By editors like yourself?

02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:25.680
[Guest]: No, no.

02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:31.200
[Guest]: I mean, maybe through experience, but they're better trained even in their colleges.

02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:35.080
[Guest]: You have colleges which train you in journalism, there are colleges which train you now in

02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:39.920
[Guest]: sports journalism, there are colleges which train you in your writing skills.

02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:41.540
[Guest]: You yourself do this.

02:22:41.540 --> 02:22:48.320
[Guest]: You train people in writing better, not just sports, but any subject, basic concept of

02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:50.240
[Guest]: what good writing is.

02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:54.880
[Guest]: So there are people who are trained in that, and they are better.

02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:59.320
[Guest]: But at the same time, I would say that the earlier generation good writers would have

02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:05.840
[Guest]: been equally good today, if they were there, and there have been still wonderful writers

02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:07.240
[Guest]: of that the earlier era.

02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:11.760
[Guest]: It's not as if, as if they were bad writers, they were good writers.

02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:17.180
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I mean, the most memorable cricket writing that I read is really written by people

02:23:17.180 --> 02:23:18.180
[Amit Varma]: in that generation.

02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:23.920
[Amit Varma]: But there's a selection bias, I'm just kind of, I don't read as much of a volume of cricket

02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:26.780
[Amit Varma]: writing today as I perhaps should.

02:23:26.780 --> 02:23:31.720
[Amit Varma]: My next question refers to something we discussed, but from a different angle, like we spoke

02:23:31.720 --> 02:23:36.400
[Amit Varma]: about how there is a danger that in journalism, writers can become jaded, and they can go

02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:39.360
[Amit Varma]: through the motions and they're ticking boxes and all of that.

02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:44.560
[Amit Varma]: And that is just at the level of, you know, the everyday sort of routines of the job and

02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:45.720
[Amit Varma]: how you handle it.

02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:49.520
[Amit Varma]: But there is something broader there that, you know, I want to ask you about, which is

02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:56.520
[Amit Varma]: that when we talk of journalism, at one level, it is a profession, that is all it is people

02:23:56.520 --> 02:23:58.040
[Amit Varma]: want to read what happened.

02:23:58.040 --> 02:24:02.720
[Amit Varma]: A journalist is someone who will collect the facts, write a readable report, put it out

02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:05.040
[Amit Varma]: there, there's a functional element to it.

02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:09.320
[Amit Varma]: The journalistic outfit is therefore a business, there is supply and demand, you're fulfilling

02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:13.320
[Amit Varma]: the demand with your supply, and the profit and loss statement matters.

02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:18.720
[Amit Varma]: And beyond that, values don't really matter, it just matters that you fulfill the demand.

02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:24.600
[Amit Varma]: And there is another view of journalism, which is a romantic view, which will be that no,

02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:31.640
[Amit Varma]: there are certain values which are core to good journalism, you know, that of like, the

02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:36.600
[Amit Varma]: whole notion of say, afflicting the comfortable and comforting the afflicted, you know, which

02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:38.360
[Amit Varma]: is such a cliche also.

02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:42.640
[Amit Varma]: But that whole notion of doing the first draft of history, as well as you can, with all the

02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:47.640
[Amit Varma]: integrity you can, and so on and so forth, you know, there are certain values that you

02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:48.640
[Amit Varma]: bring to the game.

02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:53.720
[Amit Varma]: I agree with you that objectivity is impossible per se, because everybody is who they are,

02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:55.480
[Amit Varma]: they're coming from a particular place.

02:24:55.480 --> 02:25:00.560
[Amit Varma]: But within that you make the best good faith effort, you know, to do justice to the facts

02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:02.400
[Amit Varma]: as you see them.

02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:06.920
[Amit Varma]: And there is today a conflict, I think, I mean, there's always been a conflict, but

02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:11.760
[Amit Varma]: today, it seems stark, a conflict between these two visions of journalism, where on

02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:18.240
[Amit Varma]: the one hand, somebody who owns a journalistic outfit will say profit and loss, you know,

02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:21.520
[Amit Varma]: if for example, the government of the day doesn't like what I'm doing, and they do,

02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:26.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, carry out an income tax rate on the other business that I run.

02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:29.920
[Amit Varma]: So I'm going to toe the line and I don't care about your final values, you go to hell.

02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:34.960
[Amit Varma]: And on the other hand, people believe and in a way, I believe that there is something

02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:40.880
[Amit Varma]: there are higher values that you have to kind of fight for, and that matters.

02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:46.760
[Amit Varma]: And this again relates to the whole jadedness thing, that, you know, you can get jaded in

02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:50.440
[Amit Varma]: terms of the sort of routines you follow and all of that.

02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:56.040
[Amit Varma]: But you know, some people can get jaded, and some people can always just try to look at

02:25:56.040 --> 02:25:58.360
[Amit Varma]: what they're writing about in a fresh way.

02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:03.720
[Amit Varma]: And equally, some people can treat it just as a business, it's functional, but some people

02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:07.280
[Amit Varma]: can always keep those higher principles in mind.

02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:09.760
[Amit Varma]: So what what's your view on all of this?

02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:15.240
[Guest]: See, ideally, obviously, who would not want to say that the higher principles are more

02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:16.240
[Guest]: important.

02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:23.280
[Guest]: I mean, those higher principles are not that you, you are like doing something which you're

02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:24.800
[Guest]: not meant to do.

02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:31.920
[Guest]: You are meant to, say, for instance, you take a match, you are meant to report the match

02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:36.840
[Guest]: as faithfully possible to your readers what has happened.

02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:46.960
[Guest]: Your role is very secondary, actually, you are a medium, you're not doing the actual

02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:52.200
[Guest]: job, you are not the main player in that, you are just conveying.

02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:54.000
[Guest]: Now how do you convey that?

02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:00.480
[Guest]: You can only convey that as I was saying earlier, also, you understand that, see, one of the

02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:08.000
[Guest]: principles of reporting a match at that level is that you are so good at understanding technically,

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.200
[Guest]: the skills of the game that you can report it faithfully.

02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:14.680
[Guest]: Now that itself is an ethical principle.

02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:22.720
[Guest]: I mean, now this ethical principle doesn't require any great sacrifice, it requires sacrifice

02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:27.960
[Guest]: in the sense that you have to train yourself for that, how good are you for that.

02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:33.320
[Guest]: You have to be, I mean, as a journalist, your job is, what is a journalist's job?

02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:40.200
[Guest]: To report faithfully whatever he sees, that itself requires to see the truth or to see

02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:47.720
[Guest]: something as close to truth as it is possible within your capacity.

02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:51.760
[Guest]: So these are higher principles, I don't think these are higher principles which require

02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:58.960
[Guest]: you to go on a fast or become an activist, no.

02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:04.720
[Guest]: Now you're talking about ideologically inclined journalism.

02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:09.240
[Amit Varma]: I think what I do is go outside the context of cricket, you know, and just talk about

02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:14.260
[Amit Varma]: what is happening in the space of political journalism or just in a matter of reporting

02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:18.800
[Amit Varma]: what is happening in the country, because too much of our journalism, quote unquote

02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:24.720
[Amit Varma]: journalism today seems to be about narrative battles, and not really about what happened.

02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:29.080
[Amit Varma]: And I think just to reframe my question, I think I was imprecise when I sort of expressed

02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:30.080
[Amit Varma]: myself.

02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:34.680
[Amit Varma]: But to reframe it, my question would be that, in that broader context of writing the first

02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:44.000
[Amit Varma]: draft of history, is it possible or sustainable for those higher value journalism to be done?

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:50.240
[Amit Varma]: Because when the environment is the way it is, you know, then it almost seems practical,

02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:55.760
[Amit Varma]: that if I am running a journalistic outfit, I'll be like, I want to keep running my outfit,

02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:58.600
[Amit Varma]: not get into trouble with the government, because you can shut me down.

02:28:58.600 --> 02:29:01.480
[Amit Varma]: I want to keep making profits and give people what they want.

02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:06.280
[Amit Varma]: If they want Annab Goswami, I will give them Annab Goswami and 40 shouting people on a

02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:07.280
[Amit Varma]: screen.

02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:08.280
[Amit Varma]: Right.

02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:11.560
[Amit Varma]: And there is a certain cold monetary logic to that as well.

02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:17.960
[Amit Varma]: So is it and you see smaller people who have less to lose, and because they have less to

02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:19.160
[Amit Varma]: lose, they can fight.

02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:23.840
[Amit Varma]: So you see smaller people like the news minute or a scroll or alt news, and so on and all

02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:29.000
[Amit Varma]: fighting this, you know, and even those guys, if the government really cares about, you

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:32.360
[Amit Varma]: know, starts caring about English media, they can stomp them down as well.

02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:38.400
[Amit Varma]: So my question really is that, you know, is there a space is it sustainable for values

02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:42.560
[Amit Varma]: based journalism of the kind that we're talking about to survive in cricket, of course, is

02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:43.560
[Amit Varma]: not much at stake.

02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:45.800
[Amit Varma]: I mean, everybody wants to describe the facts.

02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:50.800
[Guest]: No, even even in sports journalism, cricket journalism, it's becoming difficult because

02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:56.800
[Guest]: there are sponsors who advertise in the newspapers and they pay them huge money for advertising.

02:29:56.800 --> 02:30:01.080
[Guest]: And you can't like if you want to be critical of something wrong has happened, you are prevented

02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:05.120
[Guest]: from doing that because the paper's profitability suffers.

02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:09.520
[Guest]: So it's a difficult situation.

02:30:09.520 --> 02:30:17.040
[Guest]: It's extremely difficult to be an honest journalist, even if you are ideologically inclined towards

02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:20.680
[Guest]: the same government, which is controlling power.

02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:27.320
[Guest]: Because if you're an honest journalist, even there, you may be logically inclined towards

02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:28.320
[Guest]: them.

02:30:28.320 --> 02:30:31.800
[Guest]: But at the same time, if there are wrong things happening, there are corruption happening,

02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:37.160
[Guest]: if you are treating people badly, if the policy has gone wrong, you will be critical, even

02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:44.000
[Guest]: if you are if you are left liberally inclined, like what happened during Congress's regime.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:49.840
[Guest]: Maybe they were not as controlling of media there, even their own people who are inclined

02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:54.880
[Guest]: towards their larger policies were critical of them or harshly critical of them.

02:30:54.880 --> 02:31:02.480
[Guest]: But today's time, I mean, it's a very, I don't want to become, I don't want to pontificate

02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:04.400
[Guest]: because it's a difficult situation.

02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:06.560
[Guest]: People have to make a living out of it.

02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:10.200
[Guest]: It's after all the career, it's not that they are activists and they're making a living

02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:11.880
[Guest]: from something else.

02:31:11.880 --> 02:31:13.240
[Guest]: So what do you do?

02:31:13.240 --> 02:31:19.760
[Guest]: And the question is that with such kind of a draconian control, what does a journalist

02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:20.760
[Guest]: do?

02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:26.320
[Guest]: I mean, it will be very difficult for me to be in their shoes and say that, no, no, no,

02:31:26.320 --> 02:31:32.240
[Guest]: I will like, I will still be critical, I will write what the truth is, even if I lose my

02:31:32.240 --> 02:31:33.240
[Guest]: job.

02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:35.240
[Guest]: It's easier said than done.

02:31:35.240 --> 02:31:43.880
[Guest]: Somehow, some balance has to be needed and we are at a very critical point in our society,

02:31:43.880 --> 02:31:46.480
[Guest]: in our state.

02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:48.320
[Guest]: And where do we go from here?

02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:54.800
[Guest]: These are questions which I think I am incapable of actually, I wholeheartedly agree with you

02:31:54.800 --> 02:31:59.640
[Guest]: that these principles are, I mean, more important.

02:31:59.640 --> 02:32:06.160
[Guest]: And I'm sure there are still people who are adhering to those principles at a great cost

02:32:06.160 --> 02:32:07.820
[Guest]: to themselves.

02:32:07.820 --> 02:32:17.560
[Guest]: And that's why you need to admire, respect and marvel at their strength to fight.

02:32:17.560 --> 02:32:23.760
[Amit Varma]: There's sort of another question, and this, you know, comes from a number of points in

02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:24.760
[Amit Varma]: your book.

02:32:24.760 --> 02:32:28.360
[Amit Varma]: And there is this incident you narrate in your book, which you recall as a chilling

02:32:28.360 --> 02:32:30.320
[Amit Varma]: incident that you haven't been able to forget.

02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:34.560
[Amit Varma]: And I'll sort of read these paras out because it chilled me as well when I read it.

02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:39.920
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, seemed not, you know, like, why should it be unfamiliar to any of

02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:41.960
[Amit Varma]: us given the way the system works?

02:32:41.960 --> 02:32:47.760
[Amit Varma]: And you talk about, you know, you're talking about a particular point in time, and you

02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:53.320
[Amit Varma]: write about the Patiala District Cricket Association, and you say, quote, the Patiala District Cricket

02:32:53.320 --> 02:32:55.840
[Amit Varma]: Association was taking good care of us.

02:32:55.840 --> 02:32:59.320
[Amit Varma]: One of the dinners thrown by them ran late, some of us got a bit too drunk.

02:32:59.320 --> 02:33:05.280
[Amit Varma]: So one of the public relations officers, PRO of the Punjab government was given the responsibility

02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:07.220
[Amit Varma]: of seeing us to a hotel safely.

02:33:07.220 --> 02:33:09.160
[Amit Varma]: He was a burly man with a big turban.

02:33:09.160 --> 02:33:11.440
[Amit Varma]: I was asked to sit in a jeep in a parking lot.

02:33:11.440 --> 02:33:13.760
[Amit Varma]: I probably dozed off in the front seat.

02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:16.240
[Amit Varma]: And when I woke up, I realized there were two people at the back.

02:33:16.240 --> 02:33:19.120
[Amit Varma]: I gathered that one was a public relations man.

02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:23.320
[Amit Varma]: And the other was a professional photographer who was assigned to cover these kind of events

02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:24.520
[Amit Varma]: for a fee.

02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:29.840
[Amit Varma]: What startled me was a desperate tone in which he was pleading with the PRO not to stop giving

02:33:29.840 --> 02:33:32.640
[Amit Varma]: him work as it would affect his earnings.

02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:36.640
[Amit Varma]: The PRO was stern and rude, saying how can you refuse our demand fulfilled at first and

02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:38.200
[Amit Varma]: your assignments won't stop.

02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:40.160
[Amit Varma]: The photographer continued pleading.

02:33:40.160 --> 02:33:41.680
[Amit Varma]: Please understand she is my daughter.

02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:43.320
[Amit Varma]: How can you ask me to do this?

02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:44.320
[Amit Varma]: Ask for anyone else.

02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:45.320
[Amit Varma]: I will do it.

02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:46.320
[Amit Varma]: But not this.

02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:47.320
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:48.320
[Amit Varma]: He was begging.

02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:49.320
[Amit Varma]: His voice choked.

02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:50.320
[Amit Varma]: The burly Sikh wouldn't budge.

02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:53.400
[Amit Varma]: Like the debauched Maharajas of old, he said, no one can refuse us.

02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:57.480
[Amit Varma]: Fulfill the wish and it will be business as usual, otherwise dot dot dot.

02:33:57.480 --> 02:33:58.480
[Amit Varma]: By then I was wide awake.

02:33:58.480 --> 02:33:59.480
[Amit Varma]: And these are your words.

02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:00.760
[Amit Varma]: By then I was wide awake.

02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:01.960
[Amit Varma]: Was this for real?

02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:03.920
[Amit Varma]: Was this conversation really taking place?

02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:08.680
[Amit Varma]: A wave of emotions, fear, disbelief, disgust, and even a feeling of humiliation overwhelmed

02:34:08.680 --> 02:34:09.680
[Amit Varma]: me.

02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:13.480
[Amit Varma]: And this conversation haunts me even today, that PRO went on to become a very influential

02:34:13.480 --> 02:34:17.400
[Amit Varma]: man in Punjab's political setup.

02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:22.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, later in a different part of the book, you speak about, you know, the corruption

02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:25.800
[Amit Varma]: within the cricketing ecosystem itself, which we know about.

02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:30.860
[Amit Varma]: And one example you give us of the great bowler, Rajinder Goel, when he was a junior selector,

02:34:30.860 --> 02:34:35.080
[Amit Varma]: you know, he insisted on picking one boy in the, you know, the junior team.

02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:36.960
[Amit Varma]: And people kept asking him, why him?

02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:38.120
[Amit Varma]: He's done nothing.

02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:42.800
[Amit Varma]: And then he said that, no, no, he revealed that this kid is the son of the postman.

02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:46.840
[Amit Varma]: And the last time I didn't select him, all my letters kept getting misplaced.

02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:49.040
[Amit Varma]: So I just don't want my letters to get misplaced.

02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:53.320
[Amit Varma]: I can't think of any other way, you know, which tells you about the different ways in

02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:55.040
[Amit Varma]: which people have power over your lives.

02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:59.160
[Amit Varma]: And in this case, it's a humble postman, but obviously, you know, the rich and the powerful

02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:04.240
[Amit Varma]: pull their strings and just, you know, corrupt the system in this way.

02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:12.480
[Amit Varma]: And in another part, you have this sort of passage, where you write about, you know,

02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:16.800
[Amit Varma]: the Mandal years, where, you know, you write, I worked for the Indian Express in Chandigarh

02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:21.040
[Amit Varma]: for 15 years, and later years of this period would be spent drinking in the press club

02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:26.480
[Amit Varma]: in sector 27 and having loud boisterous arguments with friends, while indulging in inane gossip

02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:28.080
[Amit Varma]: or debates on cricket.

02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:32.920
[Amit Varma]: Around us was emerging the specter of Punjab terrorism and strained Sikh Hindu relationships.

02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:37.560
[Amit Varma]: The Mandal commission that exposed the hierarchical fault lines in Hindu society and the Hindu

02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:42.540
[Amit Varma]: right wing symbolized by the Ram temple movement and the demolition of the Babri Masjid.

02:35:42.540 --> 02:35:47.080
[Amit Varma]: What amazes me today when I recall that period is how we managed to focus on the game despite

02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:51.560
[Amit Varma]: the killings, the fear and the sectarian and caste divides that were devastating life,

02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:52.560
[Amit Varma]: stop quote.

02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:56.440
[Amit Varma]: And so the larger question I'm coming at through all of this is that in all these years that

02:35:56.440 --> 02:36:01.960
[Amit Varma]: you were a cricket journalist, you were obviously deeply affected by all of these things.

02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:07.240
[Amit Varma]: The rot within our society, the rot within the cricket ecosystem itself, and then all

02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:10.320
[Amit Varma]: these fissures and divisions which are sort of exploding.

02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:16.160
[Amit Varma]: So you know, the almost rhetorical question that you pose in at the end of the Pariah

02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:21.240
[Amit Varma]: readout is, is what I'd ask you that did you then feel tempted ki nahi yaar abhi cricket

02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:22.400
[Amit Varma]: bahut ho gaya hai.

02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:24.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, I want to write about these other things.

02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:29.080
[Amit Varma]: I want to be part of, you know, covering all of this other stuff.

02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:31.160
[Amit Varma]: So how was it psychologically?

02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:36.040
[Amit Varma]: Like, were you able to compartmentalize and say ki theek hai, this one part of me, which

02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:40.600
[Amit Varma]: is the concerned citizen, and then I'm doing a job, which is a cricket journalist, I'll

02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:41.600
[Amit Varma]: continue doing that.

02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:45.600
[Amit Varma]: Or were you ever tempted ki theek hai, you know, let me, let me write about other things

02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:47.960
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, so on and so forth.

02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:49.840
[Guest]: Well, yes, I was tempted.

02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:55.360
[Guest]: I had a lot of friends of mine who used to tell me that, look, you since you're interested

02:36:55.360 --> 02:37:00.920
[Guest]: and involved with so many things, why don't you write about them?

02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:07.320
[Guest]: Maybe I felt I was tempted, but at the same time, this comfort of doing a job and a fixed

02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:12.640
[Guest]: salary and now to disturb that whole ecosystem would be difficult.

02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:15.840
[Guest]: Maybe that prevented me from taking this leap.

02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:22.880
[Guest]: I think that's one of the important reasons why if you see in my career, it's not as if

02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:32.280
[Guest]: I lacked understanding of the game, it's not as if I didn't have access to cricketers,

02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:37.320
[Guest]: I got more and more involved with writing on the corruption of the game.

02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:45.160
[Guest]: I think that was my way of getting out of this everyday match report when so much around

02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:46.840
[Guest]: was happening.

02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:53.640
[Guest]: And that's why I think it took me to the match fixing story, took me to take a lot of strong

02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:57.560
[Guest]: articles or exposes on cricket corruption.

02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:05.240
[Guest]: I think that's one reason why I'm known more, people know me as somebody who, he was someone

02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:08.080
[Guest]: who was written on the match fixing.

02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:13.200
[Guest]: There are many times I want to tell people that, look, I understand the game as well

02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:19.880
[Guest]: as a lot of journalists would, a lot of good journalists do, because it's not as if my

02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:28.200
[Guest]: lack of my understanding of the game made me become more and more like a political journalist

02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:32.760
[Guest]: who sees cricket in that prism and writes about its officials.

02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:38.600
[Guest]: But I think that's the short point I want to make is that's one main reason that why

02:38:38.600 --> 02:38:47.240
[Guest]: I shifted from purely as a match reporter to writing about cricket related issues of

02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:49.080
[Amit Varma]: corruption.

02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:53.480
[Amit Varma]: And did that ever get you into trouble?

02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:56.140
[Amit Varma]: Was that a more risky path for you to take?

02:38:56.140 --> 02:39:01.480
[Amit Varma]: Because obviously, when you start writing about all of these issues, you know, the board

02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:05.280
[Amit Varma]: can get pissed off, local authorities can get pissed off.

02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:08.840
[Amit Varma]: It's kind of a, it's a riskier route to take.

02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:13.640
[Guest]: Well, I think I was again, you see, I was without a job for a year in Pioneer.

02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:21.280
[Guest]: When I went to 96, 97, I did that fixing report from West Indies, but I didn't lose my job

02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:22.280
[Guest]: because of that.

02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:26.880
[Guest]: We walked out because of certain issues with the paper and its ownership, which are in

02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:27.880
[Guest]: the book.

02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:30.080
[Guest]: I was in with Indian Express.

02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:34.240
[Guest]: Before that, I had come from Chandigarh with the promise that I will become its sports

02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:37.080
[Guest]: editor or the reason in charge, it never happened.

02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:42.280
[Guest]: I could hardly get to write, but I don't think they were connected with, I would believe

02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:45.760
[Guest]: that they were not connected with what I was writing.

02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:52.840
[Guest]: My later part of my writings, in a way, made me a pariah with the cricket administration.

02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:59.760
[Guest]: I had a lot of issues with them and they would, but I was lucky enough to say, become the

02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:03.280
[Guest]: sports editor of a big newspaper.

02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:10.880
[Guest]: So because of that, I could overcome those shortcomings, in the sense the shortcomings

02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:15.800
[Guest]: that your access, you no longer have that access.

02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:16.800
[Guest]: So I was lucky.

02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:19.240
[Guest]: I would say that it happened in the later part of my career.

02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:26.400
[Guest]: Maybe I was already, already I had established myself in the profession and people who would,

02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:31.160
[Guest]: if it had been done by a younger reporter, maybe he would have suffered more.

02:40:31.160 --> 02:40:37.320
[Guest]: In my case, maybe they found it more difficult to deal with me because I was already established

02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:43.920
[Guest]: and that could be the reason why I didn't suffer as much as a lot of people do when

02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:46.720
[Amit Varma]: they write like that.

02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:52.680
[Amit Varma]: When I was, you know, a cricket journalist at Wisden, I remember calling one of our cricketing

02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:57.960
[Amit Varma]: legends from the 60s and 70s for a quote on something or the other.

02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:03.040
[Amit Varma]: And when he learned I was from Wisden, he said, what about vitamin M?

02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:05.160
[Amit Varma]: And I was like, what is vitamin M?

02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:09.040
[Amit Varma]: And then I realized that, you know, he wants to get paid for a quote.

02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:10.400
[Amit Varma]: And that was a very poignant moment.

02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:15.000
[Amit Varma]: I honestly, I felt like crying because this is, you know, one of the heroes you idolize

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.840
[Amit Varma]: and you totally understand where they're coming from because in their generation, they really

02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:21.880
[Amit Varma]: took up the game for the love of it.

02:41:21.880 --> 02:41:25.360
[Amit Varma]: And of course, jobs and other things happen, but basically there's not much money.

02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:29.720
[Amit Varma]: They're not getting rich, there aren't endorsements, all of this stuff isn't happening.

02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:31.480
[Amit Varma]: And they've lost out on all that.

02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:37.800
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, during your career, you saw the transition of the game from a point where

02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:42.200
[Amit Varma]: you're going from a sort of an amateur ethic kind of thing where people aren't really making

02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:46.720
[Amit Varma]: that much money, where if you play at the Ranji level, you do it because you know, State

02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:51.640
[Amit Varma]: Bank of India will give you a job or services will give you a job or whatever, to a stage

02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:56.480
[Amit Varma]: where cricketers became phenomenally rich as they are today.

02:41:56.480 --> 02:42:01.560
[Amit Varma]: And the IPL, in fact, God bless it spread that wealth around among cricketers even more.

02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:05.040
[Amit Varma]: So you had a broader pool of people who are making a lot of money.

02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:10.920
[Amit Varma]: But in that transition came those years of match fixing, which are also poignant for

02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:14.400
[Amit Varma]: different reasons, and which you covered so closely.

02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:20.320
[Amit Varma]: And what I am always struck by is the human aspect of that, that why do players who are

02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:24.920
[Amit Varma]: superstars who are so already idealized by their countries to the extent that people

02:42:24.920 --> 02:42:28.280
[Amit Varma]: would even make temples for them?

02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:32.600
[Amit Varma]: Why are they so tempted that they risk it all for something like this?

02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:36.160
[Amit Varma]: And that human story has really been sort of fascinating to me.

02:42:36.160 --> 02:42:39.680
[Amit Varma]: And match fixing was part of it for a long time, like you narrate an incident from I

02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:44.520
[Amit Varma]: think 1979, where Gundappa Vishwanath was the captain of a game against Pakistan.

02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:48.800
[Amit Varma]: And he said that Asif Iqbal came to him and said that, listen, we'll toss and all that.

02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:53.560
[Amit Varma]: But no matter how the coin lands, we'll both say that India won the toss, right?

02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:56.320
[Amit Varma]: And Vishwanath doesn't know how to react to that, like, what is this?

02:42:56.320 --> 02:42:57.600
[Amit Varma]: What is even happening?

02:42:57.600 --> 02:43:00.680
[Amit Varma]: So from back then, this was in the air.

02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:05.840
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about how you realized that this stuff was going on?

02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:08.320
[Amit Varma]: When did you begin to realize that this was serious?

02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:12.380
[Amit Varma]: What were your feelings as a fan of cricket and a cricket writer and someone who knew

02:43:12.380 --> 02:43:15.800
[Amit Varma]: so many of these cricketers personally about what was happening?

02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:20.400
[Amit Varma]: And how did you then, you know, do all that you did, all the journalism that you did leading

02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:26.080
[Amit Varma]: up to writing the book and, you know, all of that, how did it all pan out?

02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:34.200
[Guest]: See I think because of my varied interest in what was happening in the society, I kind

02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:40.280
[Guest]: of branched out in a way and I started looking at things differently, looking at the administration

02:43:40.280 --> 02:43:43.600
[Guest]: of cricket differently.

02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:50.760
[Guest]: So in that, once I realized that the fraternity, the cricketing fraternity itself was talking

02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:58.360
[Guest]: about fixing, be it the players you knew or be it the officials you knew, today when I

02:43:58.360 --> 02:44:06.640
[Guest]: look back, I find it very deeply, I mean, it's a failure of the journalism at that point

02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:12.720
[Guest]: of time that there were not many people, we all journalists had heard about it, knew about

02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:13.720
[Guest]: it.

02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:14.720
[Guest]: I know it's difficult.

02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:15.720
[Guest]: How do you write about it?

02:44:15.720 --> 02:44:21.680
[Guest]: I mean, it's such a, unless you have proof, you can't make such an allegation that, look,

02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:27.880
[Guest]: this cricket whole ecosystem is plagued with this malice.

02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:33.120
[Guest]: But at least people were being made aware that this possibility is there and a time

02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:42.160
[Guest]: had reached by 96-97 that if you were part of that fraternity, it was talked as if you

02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:45.200
[Guest]: watch a match and they'll say, oh, yeh khaya hoga pesa.

02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:47.760
[Guest]: I mean, these are people who are involved with the game.

02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:50.380
[Guest]: These are not spectators talking.

02:44:50.380 --> 02:44:56.440
[Guest]: So once I was aware of it, I was looking for an opportunity to, how do you write about

02:44:56.440 --> 02:44:57.440
[Guest]: it?

02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:06.280
[Guest]: And that was provided in 97 in West Indies where this bookie was there and a relationship

02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:12.540
[Guest]: is formed and I realized that, then I talked to Tendulkar before doing the story.

02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:19.520
[Guest]: So I do a story, it's a story which is suggesting, telling the readers that this possibility

02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:21.440
[Guest]: is very much there.

02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:26.160
[Guest]: It's not a story which is saying that so-and-so has taken money and, because at that time

02:45:26.160 --> 02:45:30.120
[Guest]: there were a lot of other stories floating around, like Shane Warne had said that Salim

02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:31.720
[Guest]: Ali had offered him money.

02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:33.480
[Guest]: So I did my own story.

02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:40.400
[Guest]: The only thing the difference was, it was in an Indian context and we telling readers

02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:43.480
[Guest]: that it's a possibility which is very much there.

02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:50.680
[Guest]: I wouldn't have done that story if I was not privy to what was happening or what was being

02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:51.680
[Guest]: talked about.

02:45:51.680 --> 02:45:56.440
[Guest]: Otherwise, to a lay leader, it might have looked like many people said that this is

02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:00.440
[Guest]: what sensationalizing something very trivial that there is a book.

02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:01.440
[Guest]: So what?

02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:02.720
[Guest]: There's so many people.

02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:08.600
[Guest]: But I had taken a conscious decision to do that story because I knew that there is truth

02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:09.680
[Amit Varma]: behind it.

02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:14.320
[Amit Varma]: And the story just to summarize for the listeners is that a bookie had approached you and offered

02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:15.320
[Amit Varma]: you money.

02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:20.640
[Guest]: Offered me money to introduce him to top Indian cricketers to manipulate matches.

02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:26.120
[Guest]: And the bookie also had said that he has been stopped from visiting South Africa because

02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:33.680
[Guest]: he has gone there so often because South African cricketers are the maximum involved in match

02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:34.680
[Guest]: fixing.

02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:42.240
[Guest]: I mean, this is this thing written in the book, which was published in 99 and the Hensi

02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:45.200
[Guest]: Krone episode broke about a year later.

02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:53.040
[Guest]: So that fellow may have been fibbing, but but circumstantial silly if he's saying that

02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:54.860
[Guest]: and it turns out to be true.

02:46:54.860 --> 02:47:04.200
[Guest]: So what I'm trying to say is that I did that story and that story because I was not me.

02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:06.720
[Guest]: Every journalist knew that it is happening.

02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:12.640
[Guest]: So at least your obligation to your readers is to tell them that, look, this is there.

02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:14.760
[Guest]: It's not let's not talk among ourselves alone.

02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:18.240
[Guest]: Let the readers also know that this thing is there.

02:47:18.240 --> 02:47:21.880
[Guest]: Then Outlook and Anirudh Bahl and they did a fantastic job.

02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:23.520
[Guest]: They went deeper into it.

02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:26.480
[Guest]: They provided proof of it.

02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:31.120
[Guest]: But my relationship with the Indian board strained so much that they would not talk

02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:32.120
[Guest]: to me.

02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:39.120
[Guest]: In fact, Justice Chandrachud, who was a retired Supreme Court Chief Justice, when that one

02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:44.760
[Guest]: man committee was formed by the board, his point of reference was my story also.

02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:50.560
[Guest]: Among the reference points was that people say this, this pioneer story but done by this

02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:51.920
[Guest]: says this.

02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:54.760
[Guest]: And he calls journalists to appear before him.

02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:56.600
[Guest]: He doesn't call me, which is strange.

02:47:56.600 --> 02:48:00.400
[Guest]: I mean, he refers to my story but doesn't call me.

02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:05.080
[Guest]: So the rot is in that level.

02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:07.680
[Guest]: So I kept on writing.

02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:12.280
[Guest]: I forced my way into Chandrachud committee because I told the Bombay, I was a pioneer

02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:20.000
[Guest]: sports editor, to ask Chandrachud that when your reference is that my pioneer story that

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:23.520
[Guest]: why aren't you calling that man, you're calling other journalists, you're not calling the

02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:26.520
[Guest]: man to ask him that, why did you do that story?

02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:30.960
[Guest]: Give me facts, give me truth.

02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:39.880
[Guest]: So that's how I got into it and it created a lot of, I mean, I was without a job for

02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:40.880
[Guest]: a year or more.

02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:47.760
[Guest]: Shekhar comes to my rescue again in the book, I've written that and I think because of those

02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:53.680
[Guest]: writings also, I would have found it difficult to get back into journalism.

02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:58.200
[Amit Varma]: And you were absolutely vindicated, obviously, as we know today, you know, if you, you know,

02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:01.960
[Amit Varma]: if you don't have the timeline of the book that is published in 99, you think, yeh to

02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:09.200
[Amit Varma]: pata hai, yeh to sab ho gaya hai, but actually the revelations really broke after that.

02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:14.200
[Guest]: And the story I did was in 97 West Indies tour and the journalists started making fun

02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:15.200
[Guest]: of me.

02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:21.000
[Guest]: Yeah, they started making fun of me that yeh kya hai, hawa baazi mein story, yeh wo.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:27.120
[Guest]: I mean, I was literally, I mean, A, probably many journalists may have felt threatened

02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:30.840
[Guest]: that a lot of editors were asking them that if this story has appeared, why don't you

02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:31.840
[Guest]: follow up?

02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:33.320
[Guest]: Is there some truth in it?

02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:39.720
[Guest]: So maybe one, they came from this embarrassment that saying that, oh, we didn't do it.

02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:43.320
[Guest]: So their reaction was, it's all rubbish, it's all.

02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:48.400
[Guest]: So they, everyone was aware of, there was one important journalist who would in the

02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:54.080
[Guest]: press box be all the time with the bookies, telling them what odds are there and what

02:49:54.080 --> 02:49:55.080
[Guest]: the weather is like.

02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:58.880
[Guest]: I mean, this, all of us were aware of it.

02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:05.280
[Guest]: It's our failure that we didn't get it more about that those days into the print.

02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:13.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and again, sort of the nature of how circumstances can completely change something,

02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:17.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, comes about when you write about how, you know, when Tendulkar got the captaincy

02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:23.040
[Amit Varma]: for the second time in 99, one of his sort of conditions for taking the captaincy was

02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:25.160
[Amit Varma]: that Azhar should not be part of the team.

02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:29.240
[Amit Varma]: And apparently, the players were ready to revolt if Azhar was brought back.

02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:34.000
[Amit Varma]: And when it seemed like Azhar was going to be brought back, Tendulkar gave up the captaincy.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.040
[Amit Varma]: And at that time, there was a shadow over Kapil.

02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:37.940
[Amit Varma]: So Kapil was moved as coach.

02:50:37.940 --> 02:50:42.000
[Amit Varma]: And then right after that happened, Kronia came out and he confessed and he said that

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.920
[Amit Varma]: Azhar is the man who introduced me to the bookies.

02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:46.400
[Amit Varma]: So Azhar was out anyway.

02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:50.180
[Amit Varma]: But as you point out in the book, the counterfactual is that if Kronia had said what he said six

02:50:50.180 --> 02:50:55.880
[Amit Varma]: months earlier, Tendulkar would probably have remained captain, Kapil may not have had to

02:50:55.880 --> 02:50:59.000
[Amit Varma]: go and the Ganguly era may never have happened.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:03.840
[Guest]: Well, that's an assumption I made, may make on circumstantial evidence.

02:51:03.840 --> 02:51:09.360
[Guest]: I mean, Tendulkar has to himself corroborate that if it corroborate that, yes, it is because

02:51:09.360 --> 02:51:10.360
[Guest]: of that.

02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:14.880
[Guest]: My assumption and I feel I may not be wrong in it.

02:51:14.880 --> 02:51:16.160
[Guest]: This is what I had seen.

02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:24.360
[Guest]: I'd done the story from Australia in the 1999 tour of India's to South Africa when Tendulkar

02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:25.360
[Guest]: was captain.

02:51:25.360 --> 02:51:30.000
[Guest]: I'd confirmed the story from a player that yes, the entire Indian team was willing to

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:31.880
[Guest]: write to the board not to select Tendulkar.

02:51:31.880 --> 02:51:36.640
[Guest]: I knew for a fact that Tendulkar was suspicious of Azhar.

02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:42.440
[Guest]: So and earlier also his regaining captaincy also had to do with Tendulkar, Azhar was dropped

02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:43.960
[Guest]: from the team.

02:51:43.960 --> 02:51:50.040
[Guest]: So my assumption is that had Hansi Kronia thing broken earlier, Tendulkar had stayed

02:51:50.040 --> 02:51:51.680
[Guest]: as our captain.

02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:55.520
[Guest]: And yes, Ganguly era would have never been there.

02:51:55.520 --> 02:51:58.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, again, a fascinating sort of counterfactual.

02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:04.080
[Amit Varma]: And what was the sense you got from the players about all of this?

02:52:04.080 --> 02:52:08.720
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, a lot of people subsequently, for example, have criticized Tendulkar that

02:52:08.720 --> 02:52:11.520
[Amit Varma]: if he knew about it, he should have spoken out.

02:52:11.520 --> 02:52:17.640
[Amit Varma]: And the counterpoint to that is that, you know, that he must have thought that, you

02:52:17.640 --> 02:52:18.760
[Amit Varma]: know, why take a risk?

02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:20.000
[Amit Varma]: Why get into a mess?

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:24.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, the underworld is also involved, for example, just close your mouth and don't

02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:26.320
[Amit Varma]: talk about it and all of that.

02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:31.200
[Amit Varma]: So one, what is your view on that particular question that should the players who knew

02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:35.040
[Amit Varma]: about it have spoken out, or were they just being practical?

02:52:35.040 --> 02:52:41.600
[Amit Varma]: And the other question is that, what did the players of the time themselves feel about

02:52:41.600 --> 02:52:42.600
[Amit Varma]: it?

02:52:42.600 --> 02:52:45.520
[Amit Varma]: Like, was it really just a question of a handful of bad apples?

02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:48.640
[Amit Varma]: Or was there a deeper rot within the system?

02:52:48.640 --> 02:52:58.680
[Guest]: Look, my sense, again, I can't prove it, it's like, a lot of things can be defamatory also,

02:52:58.680 --> 02:53:04.800
[Guest]: but whatever little bit interaction with the players of earlier era, I'm not talking about

02:53:04.800 --> 02:53:10.800
[Guest]: the Ganguly era players, but the players of just preceding them, the Azhar era players

02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:19.960
[Guest]: and was even then that this practice was as far more widespread than we would like to

02:53:19.960 --> 02:53:30.720
[Guest]: believe, not just with Indian cricketers, but with cricketers internationally.

02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:39.320
[Guest]: Since if that is true, since it was so widespread, so all of them, if most of them are complicit

02:53:39.320 --> 02:53:48.520
[Guest]: in it, they would, they're part of it, they would just not want to take a stand or talk

02:53:48.520 --> 02:53:51.320
[Guest]: about it.

02:53:51.320 --> 02:53:58.520
[Guest]: Once we go into the Ganguly-Tendulkar era, Tendulkar is probably the link, I mean, he's

02:53:58.520 --> 02:54:04.800
[Guest]: the senior most among them, whether how much he was aware of it, because when I interviewed

02:54:04.800 --> 02:54:12.000
[Guest]: him in West Indies in 97, before doing the story, which I've recorded in both the books

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:18.480
[Guest]: in that also in this also in the earlier book, not quite cricket, is that he tells me that

02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:26.280
[Guest]: he's heard these stories of players being involved, but don't do the story, but give

02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:32.800
[Guest]: this number to the cops to record the conversation so that we will at least come to know the

02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:36.720
[Guest]: truth, which was a very valid suggestion.

02:54:36.720 --> 02:54:41.520
[Guest]: Maybe I was too much in a hurry to finish off the story there and not go into that.

02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:43.920
[Guest]: Maybe I should have.

02:54:43.920 --> 02:54:49.600
[Guest]: So it's obvious that Tendulkar was aware of the fact that there is this possibility, there

02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:51.560
[Guest]: may be, he had heard stories.

02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:56.400
[Guest]: How much of those stories he had proof of, I have no idea.

02:54:56.400 --> 02:55:00.320
[Guest]: Did he speak to authorities, did he speak to the establishment?

02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:01.320
[Guest]: He may have.

02:55:01.320 --> 02:55:08.880
[Guest]: I mean, the problem with our documentation is that we don't have like whistleblower establishment.

02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:14.680
[Guest]: We don't have players who have the courage to speak.

02:55:14.680 --> 02:55:18.280
[Guest]: Even today, Tendulkar on record has given many interviews in which he has said that

02:55:18.280 --> 02:55:23.660
[Guest]: he has never ever heard that match fixing was taking place.

02:55:23.660 --> 02:55:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Why was he so vehemently against Azhar being in the team then?

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:31.320
[Amit Varma]: Like it almost feels from the narrative of the book that I was almost a condition for

02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:32.320
[Guest]: him taking up the captaincy again.

02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:37.280
[Guest]: Yeah, because all these players were, that's what I'm saying, they were aware of the fact

02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:42.280
[Guest]: that Azhar could be one of the kingpins of what was happening.

02:55:42.280 --> 02:55:46.120
[Guest]: And it was their way of conveying to the board that look, don't select him.

02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:51.880
[Guest]: I mean, when they got together to say that like, if he is selected, we will withdraw

02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:56.460
[Guest]: from the team in Australia, that obviously meant that they were conveying their feelings

02:55:56.460 --> 02:55:58.960
[Guest]: to the board.

02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:05.480
[Guest]: But what board did was not listen to them, get back Azhar, his Azhar's misfortune that

02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:11.660
[Guest]: he got injured, he missed his playing 100 test match.

02:56:11.660 --> 02:56:19.040
[Guest]: And then subsequently, the whole thing exploded and we came to know what the truth is.

02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:25.720
[Amit Varma]: And my sense would be that this happened to happen in those years just before big money

02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:28.280
[Amit Varma]: became really commonplace in the game.

02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:33.680
[Amit Varma]: So when I look at the game today, for example, the way the incentives are aligned, I would

02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:38.900
[Amit Varma]: just assume that there is absolutely no top player who would even contemplate something

02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:42.920
[Amit Varma]: like this, because you're already earning so much money through legitimate means that

02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:45.180
[Amit Varma]: they would never risk their career or anything.

02:56:45.180 --> 02:56:50.480
[Amit Varma]: So if anybody is tempted by match fixing or spot fixing rather, then there'll be people

02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:56.480
[Amit Varma]: on the absolute fringes, who are, you know, who are sort of, you know, IPL squad, but

02:56:56.480 --> 02:57:00.320
[Amit Varma]: maybe not a regular member or whatever people on the fringes who are not making that kind

02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:01.720
[Amit Varma]: of insane money.

02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:07.400
[Amit Varma]: But I cannot possibly imagine any international player even contemplating it because now there

02:57:07.400 --> 02:57:08.760
[Amit Varma]: is too much to lose.

02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:11.280
[Amit Varma]: Is that something you'd agree with?

02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:16.440
[Guest]: I think in Indian context, or in context of cricket boards, which are richer, which are

02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:20.600
[Guest]: paying a great deal of money to their players, I would agree.

02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:24.880
[Guest]: But the danger lies in not the top cricketers being involved.

02:57:24.880 --> 02:57:34.280
[Guest]: The danger lies is that the bookies have infiltrated to such an extent that they target young budding

02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:37.420
[Guest]: players from the league level only.

02:57:37.420 --> 02:57:44.120
[Guest]: It is like a manager signing a player that, okay, I'll give you so much and he spots the

02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:50.040
[Guest]: talent and he says, at the age of 17, 18, he thinks this fellow can become a Tendulkar

02:57:50.040 --> 02:57:53.640
[Guest]: and let me be the first to sign him.

02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:56.040
[Guest]: I'm investing in future.

02:57:56.040 --> 02:58:02.160
[Guest]: So a lot of these bookies, as I write in this book also, what Ajay Sharma talks about MK

02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:09.200
[Guest]: and how as a small time, as a young budding cricketer, he targeted him and paid him, gave

02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:11.480
[Guest]: him money for hitting a good hundred.

02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:15.160
[Guest]: Basically he was making an investment.

02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:21.040
[Guest]: So many of these players, if they come from junior league levels and are already on the

02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:26.600
[Guest]: payroll of a bookie and they say one of them becomes a top cricketer, what happens?

02:58:26.600 --> 02:58:31.240
[Guest]: I mean, I'm just giving you a possibility.

02:58:31.240 --> 02:58:35.640
[Amit Varma]: So it makes sense that you invest in 50 junior cricketers and invest in the sense that you

02:58:35.640 --> 02:58:39.280
[Amit Varma]: go up to them after a match and you give, like in Ajay Sharma's case, you pointed out

02:58:39.280 --> 02:58:43.000
[Amit Varma]: somebody went up after he played a good innings and give him a hundred rupee note.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:48.560
[Guest]: And he was so happy because he's being appreciated, which he doesn't know, but then that relationship

02:58:48.560 --> 02:58:49.560
[Guest]: is formed.

02:58:49.560 --> 02:58:54.760
[Guest]: That fellow must be giving him money for more and more for inside information, even at the

02:58:54.760 --> 02:58:59.760
[Guest]: league level, small DDCA league level, there are betting taking place and then you kind

02:58:59.760 --> 02:59:00.760
[Amit Varma]: of manipulate.

02:59:00.760 --> 02:59:05.080
[Amit Varma]: And initially it will be harmful, harmless, seemingly harmless stuff, like tell me about

02:59:05.080 --> 02:59:09.680
[Amit Varma]: the selection beforehand or tell me, you know, what's the plan is if you win the toss or

02:59:09.680 --> 02:59:10.960
[Amit Varma]: lose the toss.

02:59:10.960 --> 02:59:14.960
[Amit Varma]: But later on, it then goes into the serious and clearly illegal territory.

02:59:14.960 --> 02:59:16.600
[Guest]: And by that time, you're too much.

02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:24.000
[Guest]: That is why it's very important to have a kind of a fair, transparent crackdown instead

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.400
[Guest]: of saying, no, no, no, no, no.

02:59:26.400 --> 02:59:32.640
[Guest]: It is not as if India's image gets tarnished or some other country's image gets tarnished.

02:59:32.640 --> 02:59:34.160
[Guest]: It's the right thing to do.

02:59:34.160 --> 02:59:39.360
[Guest]: I mean, people get tempted, there is corruption, very rich people do more and more corruption

02:59:39.360 --> 02:59:41.160
[Guest]: to earn more money.

02:59:41.160 --> 02:59:47.800
[Guest]: Another point I want to make it there, there are countries who hardly pay their cricketers.

02:59:47.800 --> 02:59:49.420
[Guest]: These are retired cricketers.

02:59:49.420 --> 02:59:55.200
[Guest]: These are cricketers who become big names in T20 leagues.

02:59:55.200 --> 03:00:02.320
[Guest]: I mean, I'm not saying they take money, but what stakes do they have in, you know, their

03:00:02.320 --> 03:00:07.600
[Guest]: career is over, they hardly get any money from their board.

03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:15.040
[Guest]: So that what I'm saying is that let's not just think that it's that there's no possibility

03:00:15.040 --> 03:00:18.560
[Amit Varma]: of this happening.

03:00:18.560 --> 03:00:25.800
[Amit Varma]: So let's now, you know, move on from this unpleasant subject and to the happier subject

03:00:25.800 --> 03:00:27.800
[Amit Varma]: of how Indian cricket evolved.

03:00:27.800 --> 03:00:32.600
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, one way in which the Ganguly era was a step from the past is that everybody's

03:00:32.600 --> 03:00:36.480
[Amit Varma]: making decent money now and, you know, the some of the bad incentives of the past may

03:00:36.480 --> 03:00:38.380
[Amit Varma]: not necessarily exist.

03:00:38.380 --> 03:00:42.840
[Amit Varma]: But the other way in which it changed is that I think the Ganguly generation was perhaps

03:00:42.840 --> 03:00:50.760
[Amit Varma]: almost the first generation of Indian cricket, which represented that post liberalization

03:00:50.760 --> 03:00:53.600
[Amit Varma]: reality, that the middle class has exploded.

03:00:53.600 --> 03:00:58.320
[Amit Varma]: And one way of seeing the explosion of the middle class is that number one in your big

03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:02.600
[Amit Varma]: traditional cities like Bombay and Delhi, the opportunity cost of playing cricket has

03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:06.960
[Amit Varma]: gone up because there's so much else you can do with your time, so many more opportunities,

03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:12.240
[Amit Varma]: so many ways of leisure, so many things you can aspire to, that people in the big cities

03:01:12.240 --> 03:01:17.680
[Amit Varma]: will not necessarily travel in those numbers for three hours on a local train to get to

03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:22.960
[Amit Varma]: Shivaji Park and, you know, play every morning at six o'clock, while at the same time, people

03:01:22.960 --> 03:01:27.600
[Amit Varma]: in the small towns across India are now coming into the means where they can buy cricket

03:01:27.600 --> 03:01:31.640
[Amit Varma]: bats and cricket equipment, and there are nets springing up and academies springing

03:01:31.640 --> 03:01:32.640
[Amit Varma]: up.

03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:37.320
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, in that generation in the aughties, Ganguly Dravid onwards, and really exploding

03:01:37.320 --> 03:01:42.360
[Amit Varma]: Dhoni onwards, where you have the traditional cricket centers of Bombay, Delhi, not producing

03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:47.640
[Amit Varma]: so many cricketers, but cricketers coming from small towns all over the place from humbler

03:01:47.640 --> 03:01:50.000
[Amit Varma]: backgrounds from different backgrounds.

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:53.880
[Amit Varma]: So you know, tell me a little bit about like, first, would you sort of agree with this thesis

03:01:53.880 --> 03:02:00.560
[Amit Varma]: that this is that larger change in society is kind of being reflected in this way?

03:02:00.560 --> 03:02:04.920
[Amit Varma]: And you know, what are the ways in which you found Indian cricket evolving, you know, during

03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:07.440
[Amit Varma]: that interesting period?

03:02:07.440 --> 03:02:14.480
[Guest]: Yes, this is obviously true, because more and more cricketers from smaller towns started

03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:20.480
[Guest]: getting selected in the Indian team, which obviously had to do with the greater infrastructure,

03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:23.920
[Guest]: more money being spread around.

03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:31.720
[Guest]: Secondly, I think when you talk about that era, something what I found very interesting

03:02:31.720 --> 03:02:40.880
[Guest]: and very, I mean, trend setting or something very, very significant was that these Dravid,

03:02:40.880 --> 03:02:51.600
[Guest]: Pendulkar, Lakshman, Kumble, they were cricketers who, I mean, they may have had their differences

03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:56.520
[Guest]: with each other, they may have felt that, okay, maybe I should have been captain, Ganguly

03:02:56.520 --> 03:03:01.120
[Guest]: shouldn't have been captain, but they were team players.

03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:06.480
[Guest]: They were incredibly like, glued or wedded to the idea of team doing well.

03:03:06.480 --> 03:03:11.560
[Guest]: And where Ganguly played a significant role was, I'm not sure if Ganguly had not been

03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:12.560
[Guest]: the captain.

03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:16.840
[Guest]: If he had not been the captain, I'm not sure what role he would have played.

03:03:16.840 --> 03:03:22.280
[Guest]: But since he was the captain, and he was aware of the fact that he had to become a bigger

03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:32.000
[Guest]: captain, the team should win, had to win, he also invested a lot of his energy and effort

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:38.080
[Guest]: in trying to improve the team and not trying to disrupt, not trying to feel that, okay,

03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:41.040
[Guest]: Pendulkar might be playing games with me or Lakshman.

03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:42.880
[Guest]: So he let them be.

03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:49.240
[Guest]: He realized that they were better cricketers or he gave them their respect.

03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:55.600
[Guest]: And then, because Ganguly had such access to Dalmia, the board president, and as I write

03:03:55.600 --> 03:04:03.000
[Guest]: in the book, that Dalmia couldn't afford to annoy Ganguly because of the peculiar Ganguly

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:07.880
[Guest]: from Bengal and Dalmia doing business in Bengal.

03:04:07.880 --> 03:04:09.320
[Guest]: So he had to protect him.

03:04:09.320 --> 03:04:14.240
[Guest]: So Ganguly could take a lot of liberties with Dalmia and get away with it.

03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:20.040
[Guest]: So in a way, it helped Indian cricket because these four cricketers would tell Ganguly that

03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:24.240
[Guest]: we need this, this, this, John Wright would say we need and Ganguly would go to Dalmia

03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:30.880
[Guest]: say we and Dalmia would do it despite maybe he may not want to do a lot of these things.

03:04:30.880 --> 03:04:36.160
[Guest]: So that revolutionized Indian cricket and rest is the more and more money.

03:04:36.160 --> 03:04:37.160
[Guest]: It spread wider.

03:04:37.160 --> 03:04:43.320
[Guest]: More and more players are now coming from small town and it's great for Indian cricket

03:04:43.320 --> 03:04:46.360
[Guest]: that we have such with the game has spread so much.

03:04:46.360 --> 03:04:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's mind blowing and the IPL just took it a step forward, I think by just making

03:04:52.400 --> 03:04:57.920
[Amit Varma]: it possible for so many, by incentivizing so many more players to get into the game,

03:04:57.920 --> 03:05:01.800
[Amit Varma]: because earlier if you have to get into the India team to make serious money, and suddenly

03:05:01.800 --> 03:05:07.960
[Amit Varma]: with the IPL, no, you know, you can play for one of the franchises and make serious money.

03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:13.280
[Amit Varma]: And also what it does is it takes politics out of the, or rather the local regional politics

03:05:13.280 --> 03:05:18.480
[Amit Varma]: out of the equation in the sense that, you know, you've spoken about the politics of

03:05:18.480 --> 03:05:23.040
[Amit Varma]: selection at the junior level at the local level, everybody knows the politics around

03:05:23.040 --> 03:05:28.520
[Amit Varma]: getting selected for Delhi and you know, which is like one famous sort of basket case and

03:05:28.520 --> 03:05:33.560
[Amit Varma]: suddenly that's out because now, instead of a monopsony, where you have just one buyer

03:05:33.560 --> 03:05:37.800
[Amit Varma]: for your services, and therefore that buyer is all powerful, you have these different

03:05:37.800 --> 03:05:43.800
[Amit Varma]: teams competing for the best talent and that only you know, that works much better.

03:05:43.800 --> 03:05:50.360
[Amit Varma]: So what is, you know, your sense of cricket having come to where it is today, like, you

03:05:50.360 --> 03:05:54.920
[Amit Varma]: know, like you earlier said, I think it was before the conversation was being recorded,

03:05:54.920 --> 03:05:59.480
[Amit Varma]: that we can have seven, eight teams today, which are world class, we can actually pick

03:05:59.480 --> 03:06:03.720
[Amit Varma]: up that many teams like a historic win in Australia, for example, was really done by

03:06:03.720 --> 03:06:08.880
[Amit Varma]: a third string bunch of players who have all gotten confidence from playing against the

03:06:08.880 --> 03:06:10.520
[Amit Varma]: best in the world in the IPL.

03:06:10.520 --> 03:06:14.880
[Amit Varma]: And there's no self doubt anymore, you know, they've honed their skills in that arena.

03:06:14.880 --> 03:06:16.520
[Amit Varma]: So what is your sense?

03:06:16.520 --> 03:06:20.880
[Amit Varma]: And also, but I'll leave the next question for later, but what is sort of your sense

03:06:20.880 --> 03:06:23.920
[Amit Varma]: with where Indian cricket is today, from

03:06:23.920 --> 03:06:31.720
[Guest]: Indian cricket has never been as strong as it's today, financially, talent wise, without

03:06:31.720 --> 03:06:32.720
[Guest]: doubt.

03:06:32.720 --> 03:06:38.840
[Guest]: IPL has helped not just cricketers make money, but I think it has also helped a lot of these

03:06:38.840 --> 03:06:44.160
[Guest]: Indian cricketers to interact with the best with the world.

03:06:44.160 --> 03:06:49.480
[Guest]: And since IPL is played in an environment where it seems like it's a World Cup match,

03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:53.920
[Guest]: full stadiums, so it has helped them to soak in a lot of pressure.

03:06:53.920 --> 03:06:58.840
[Guest]: I mean, otherwise, a second or third string team playing in Australia would have cracked

03:06:58.840 --> 03:06:59.900
[Guest]: under pressure.

03:06:59.900 --> 03:07:02.280
[Guest]: But these players have seen that pressure in IPL.

03:07:02.280 --> 03:07:03.280
[Guest]: So they are pressure.

03:07:03.280 --> 03:07:06.020
[Guest]: I mean, it's making them pressure proof.

03:07:06.020 --> 03:07:10.280
[Guest]: It is helping a lot, definitely is helping Indian cricket a lot.

03:07:10.280 --> 03:07:17.080
[Guest]: My only reservation is not, see, I may not be a great IPL fan, because maybe I enjoy

03:07:17.080 --> 03:07:23.920
[Guest]: watching a five day game, I enjoy it far more, I find, but that's a personal preference.

03:07:23.920 --> 03:07:26.440
[Guest]: It doesn't mean that IPL is bad.

03:07:26.440 --> 03:07:32.360
[Guest]: My problem with IPL is that since there is so much money coming from it, and more and

03:07:32.360 --> 03:07:36.560
[Guest]: more money is coming, it's spreading.

03:07:36.560 --> 03:07:42.240
[Guest]: Will there be enough time in future left for Indian board or even other boards to invest

03:07:42.240 --> 03:07:43.720
[Guest]: in test cricket?

03:07:43.720 --> 03:07:48.520
[Guest]: After all, as I say, there are only 365 days in a year.

03:07:48.520 --> 03:07:51.960
[Guest]: You already have now extended it to three months.

03:07:51.960 --> 03:07:56.640
[Guest]: That leaves just nine months for traditional cricket, in which there will be World Cups

03:07:56.640 --> 03:07:59.040
[Guest]: also one day T20.

03:07:59.040 --> 03:08:00.720
[Guest]: So it hardly leaves time.

03:08:00.720 --> 03:08:05.800
[Guest]: And if India becomes more and more greedy, they will keep on extending it more and more.

03:08:05.800 --> 03:08:08.000
[Guest]: And I hope the time doesn't come.

03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:14.520
[Guest]: I hope the administrators have enough vision, acumen, not to destroy the traditional format,

03:08:14.520 --> 03:08:16.480
[Guest]: because it's still enjoyable to watch.

03:08:16.480 --> 03:08:24.640
[Guest]: There are skills involved there, which new entrants in the field may not enjoy that,

03:08:24.640 --> 03:08:28.860
[Guest]: but there are still people who enjoy that.

03:08:28.860 --> 03:08:34.300
[Guest]: And it's those skills which help even those who are playing IPL, because of their foundations

03:08:34.300 --> 03:08:38.680
[Guest]: are good enough that they can do all the inventive stuff in IPL.

03:08:38.680 --> 03:08:44.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I think, you know, there are two sort of different ways that I think about

03:08:44.360 --> 03:08:45.360
[Amit Varma]: this.

03:08:45.360 --> 03:08:49.560
[Amit Varma]: And one of them is that T20 cricket is a different sport from test cricket.

03:08:49.560 --> 03:08:52.200
[Amit Varma]: It's like as different as badminton and tennis are.

03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:56.360
[Amit Varma]: You just require completely different sets of skills and there are different sets of

03:08:56.360 --> 03:08:58.080
[Amit Varma]: values involved.

03:08:58.080 --> 03:09:02.040
[Amit Varma]: And I love both, but I can, I'm not going to pass judgment, we were talking about being

03:09:02.040 --> 03:09:03.040
[Amit Varma]: judgmental earlier.

03:09:03.040 --> 03:09:07.040
[Amit Varma]: I'm not going to, I'm not going to pass judgment against someone who likes one form and doesn't

03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:11.800
[Amit Varma]: like the other, whichever one it is, and may both thrive.

03:09:11.800 --> 03:09:16.280
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, I think T20 cricket has been excellent for test cricket, because

03:09:16.280 --> 03:09:20.160
[Amit Varma]: it's in a sense kept the game alive, because I think otherwise, there was a danger that

03:09:20.160 --> 03:09:23.320
[Amit Varma]: there just wasn't enough money in the game.

03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:27.760
[Amit Varma]: And to some extent, I think T20 cricket can play the part moving ahead of subsidizing

03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:28.760
[Amit Varma]: test cricket.

03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:33.120
[Amit Varma]: Now, one really cold blooded way of looking at it would be saying that everything is supply

03:09:33.120 --> 03:09:34.120
[Amit Varma]: and demand.

03:09:34.120 --> 03:09:36.440
[Amit Varma]: If people don't want to watch test cricket, let it die.

03:09:36.440 --> 03:09:42.040
[Amit Varma]: What I would rather, the way I would rather look at it is just to say that there is now

03:09:42.040 --> 03:09:47.320
[Amit Varma]: so much money in coming from T20 cricket that it doesn't cost that much to keep test cricket

03:09:47.320 --> 03:09:48.920
[Amit Varma]: alive and thriving.

03:09:48.920 --> 03:09:53.040
[Amit Varma]: Even though it's a separate sport, you know, that's, that's, that's also got a tradition

03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:54.040
[Amit Varma]: of its own.

03:09:54.040 --> 03:09:58.840
[Amit Varma]: I think over time, people will hopefully learn to and I think even younger people can get

03:09:58.840 --> 03:09:59.840
[Amit Varma]: turned on by it.

03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:03.120
[Amit Varma]: Like we've had outstanding test cricket happen in recent times.

03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:04.120
[Amit Varma]: Just outstanding.

03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:10.880
[Amit Varma]: So I'm kind of hopeful that my my next question before I before we wrap it up, and you know,

03:10:10.880 --> 03:10:13.480
[Amit Varma]: I'll ask you a couple of final questions after this.

03:10:13.480 --> 03:10:16.920
[Amit Varma]: But my next question comes from something that you know, there's another lovely para

03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:20.880
[Amit Varma]: where you've written where you talk about the early days, late 60s, 70s.

03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:25.120
[Amit Varma]: And you've written, apart from the polio stricken Chandrashekhar's mesmerizing achievements

03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:29.840
[Amit Varma]: and the emergence of Sunil Gavaskar on the 1971 tour of the West Indies, it was a pint

03:10:29.840 --> 03:10:34.640
[Amit Varma]: sized Gundappa Vishwanath century at Kanpur on his debut that stands out in my memory.

03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:40.080
[Amit Varma]: It was against the Australians in the 1969 series, when Anand Settlewad, the most eloquent

03:10:40.080 --> 03:10:45.120
[Amit Varma]: and objective of all Indian radio commentators would describe his counterattacking, we would

03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:51.000
[Amit Varma]: swell with pride as if we had something to do with his skillful strokes, a stock quote.

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:55.480
[Amit Varma]: And on the subject of this pride, later, you talk about how during a particular match,

03:10:55.480 --> 03:10:57.440
[Amit Varma]: I think must have been 76.

03:10:57.440 --> 03:11:02.120
[Amit Varma]: When we played West Indies, you talk about the commentator Ravi Chaturvedi actually weeping

03:11:02.120 --> 03:11:06.480
[Amit Varma]: during a telecast because India has won and then saying yeh Gandhi ka desh, yeh Nehru

03:11:06.480 --> 03:11:08.480
[Amit Varma]: ka desh, right.

03:11:08.480 --> 03:11:14.640
[Amit Varma]: And there is a positive aspect to this that there is a sense of shared pride and community

03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:18.920
[Amit Varma]: especially important in a country in those days where there may not have been so many

03:11:18.920 --> 03:11:21.960
[Amit Varma]: occasions for shared pride and community.

03:11:21.960 --> 03:11:28.920
[Amit Varma]: But in modern times, this can take on really ugly undertones, you know, what Orwell called

03:11:28.920 --> 03:11:29.920
[Amit Varma]: a war minus a shooting.

03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:32.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, Mike Marquez, he wrote a book with the title.

03:11:32.560 --> 03:11:38.600
[Amit Varma]: And you know, the nationalism, the jingoism that can result, the sort of, you know, the

03:11:38.600 --> 03:11:44.680
[Amit Varma]: ugliness that comes from that, the adversarial feeling between fans and between supporters.

03:11:44.680 --> 03:11:48.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the teams, of course, are adversaries in a sporting context.

03:11:48.040 --> 03:11:54.240
[Amit Varma]: But even outside of that, and there is the danger then that that feeds into a lot of

03:11:54.240 --> 03:11:58.960
[Amit Varma]: the things that divide us like the tribalism and like the sense of, you know, our people

03:11:58.960 --> 03:12:01.920
[Amit Varma]: and the other, and so on and so forth.

03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:06.360
[Amit Varma]: And to some extent, I think the IPL mitigates it because it's impossible to get a tribal

03:12:06.360 --> 03:12:10.800
[Amit Varma]: loyalty towards any of these franchises, because they're all pretty characterless, in a sense.

03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:14.560
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, at least when I watch the IPL, I just watch it for the good cricket and to

03:12:14.560 --> 03:12:19.000
[Amit Varma]: see individuals play well, but there's no loyalty per se being formed.

03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:26.520
[Amit Varma]: But you know, how does this aspect of how the game is viewed, sort of make you feel?

03:12:26.520 --> 03:12:38.760
[Guest]: Well, as I hear Gandhi ka Desh, Nehru ka Desh, a young kid feeling thrilled and almost crying

03:12:38.760 --> 03:12:48.280
[Guest]: with Ravi Chaturvedi on the radio and feeling so proud to see, let's take the other moment

03:12:48.280 --> 03:12:55.960
[Guest]: of Ganguly taking off his shirt and swinging in the air and then at Lord's and we beat

03:12:55.960 --> 03:12:58.680
[Guest]: in the Englishman.

03:12:58.680 --> 03:13:04.840
[Guest]: Today, all these things in today's context of what is happening in this nation acquire

03:13:04.840 --> 03:13:07.080
[Guest]: a more menacing kind of meaning.

03:13:07.080 --> 03:13:14.240
[Guest]: That's the, it's not, we all have loyalties, we all feel happy that our team has done well,

03:13:14.240 --> 03:13:17.920
[Guest]: but it's not at the cost of showing the other person down.

03:13:17.920 --> 03:13:24.820
[Guest]: It's how the sport is, okay, fine, we won some, we lose some, if we won, win more, great.

03:13:24.820 --> 03:13:31.440
[Guest]: But to reach a stage where winning means that we are a superior race, that's dangerous,

03:13:31.440 --> 03:13:32.440
[Guest]: that's equally dangerous.

03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:39.720
[Guest]: I suddenly remembered my Australia trip of 99, when Australia was smashing everyone and

03:13:39.720 --> 03:13:45.360
[Guest]: there was this literal feeling of, in Australia, among Australian itself, they wanted their

03:13:45.360 --> 03:13:50.640
[Guest]: own team to lose because they thought these are arrogant, some of them, that they are

03:13:50.640 --> 03:13:58.320
[Guest]: like this nationalism and this macho, broad, strong team, beating every team to pulp, is

03:13:58.320 --> 03:14:04.760
[Guest]: like taking nationalism to a level which is dangerous for them.

03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:05.760
[Guest]: I could see that.

03:14:05.760 --> 03:14:12.920
[Guest]: And I could see as India 99 losing every test match badly and literally feeling that we

03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:18.760
[Guest]: as Indians are being treated badly, cricket, we are losing on the ground, and they discriminate

03:14:18.760 --> 03:14:19.760
[Guest]: us.

03:14:19.760 --> 03:14:22.580
[Guest]: And I could see my other extreme reaction because of that.

03:14:22.580 --> 03:14:23.760
[Guest]: So there has to be a balance.

03:14:23.760 --> 03:14:31.000
[Guest]: I think, yeh Gandhi ka desh, Nehru ka desh in 71 or 76 may sound very different from

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:34.120
[Guest]: if it is done today.

03:14:34.120 --> 03:14:37.060
[Guest]: So that's how everything is in a context.

03:14:37.060 --> 03:14:39.360
[Guest]: If the context changes, the meaning also changes.

03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:44.400
[Amit Varma]: Well, I mean, today, if someone says yeh Nehru ka desh, he'll be treated as an anti-national.

03:14:44.400 --> 03:14:47.880
[Amit Varma]: Okay, you know, you've been very generous with your time.

03:14:47.880 --> 03:14:51.700
[Amit Varma]: And I'll just urge all my listeners to go out and read your book, because it's really

03:14:51.700 --> 03:14:57.720
[Amit Varma]: impossible to sort of convey what is in that book and the enjoyment I got from reading

03:14:57.720 --> 03:14:59.820
[Amit Varma]: it in a mere podcast.

03:14:59.820 --> 03:15:05.640
[Amit Varma]: So I'll end by asking a traditional question I often ask my guests, that, you know, would

03:15:05.640 --> 03:15:11.520
[Amit Varma]: you recommend for me and my listeners, you know, books, music, films that mean a lot

03:15:11.520 --> 03:15:16.880
[Amit Varma]: to you, that you hold close to your heart that are sort of desert island offerings for

03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:18.880
[Amit Varma]: you?

03:15:18.880 --> 03:15:25.920
[Guest]: Well, I would say Kurosawa for one must watch.

03:15:25.920 --> 03:15:32.240
[Guest]: And maybe I lately watched a lot of Ray again, and I would say Mahanagar or Seema Bhaddava,

03:15:32.240 --> 03:15:36.080
[Guest]: I would say pick up any one of Ray's masterpieces.

03:15:36.080 --> 03:15:44.840
[Guest]: I think they show Indian society in a different light and with a lot of perspective and a

03:15:44.840 --> 03:15:54.400
[Guest]: lot of feeling, a lot of meaning and music, 50s, I would say 50s, golden era in the film

03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:56.480
[Guest]: music, wonderful music.

03:15:56.480 --> 03:16:02.080
[Guest]: I mean, it was a fusion music, a lot of it I realized is copied from various places in

03:16:02.080 --> 03:16:05.680
[Guest]: the world, whether from West or East.

03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:13.240
[Guest]: But regardless of that, it's a wonderful music to listen, books.

03:16:13.240 --> 03:16:16.800
[Guest]: I mean, I am not a voracious reader, but I do read.

03:16:16.800 --> 03:16:22.040
[Guest]: I would suggest that lately I'm reading Ambedkar's Annihilation of Caste.

03:16:22.040 --> 03:16:30.840
[Guest]: I think I'll, and in the present political context, I would suggest that if go and buy

03:16:30.840 --> 03:16:38.880
[Guest]: that book, because Ambedkar is being today seen as this great figure, even by the right,

03:16:38.880 --> 03:16:42.720
[Guest]: they say that he's the greatest and even greater than Gandhi.

03:16:42.720 --> 03:16:46.920
[Guest]: So his seminal work of what he thought of India, what he thought of caste, what he thought

03:16:46.920 --> 03:16:49.440
[Guest]: of exploitation, they should read that book.

03:16:49.440 --> 03:16:51.200
[Guest]: Great, Pradeep.

03:16:51.200 --> 03:16:52.200
[Guest]: Thank you so much.

03:16:52.200 --> 03:16:53.200
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit.

03:16:53.200 --> 03:16:56.000
[Guest]: Thank you so much for liking the book and doing this podcast.

03:16:56.000 --> 03:17:00.240
[Guest]: I really, really enjoyed it and thanks a lot again.

03:17:00.240 --> 03:17:03.640
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

03:17:03.640 --> 03:17:07.600
[Amit Varma]: Now before we end this episode, I'll share with you a little quip I prepared for Pradeep,

03:17:07.600 --> 03:17:10.960
[Amit Varma]: but I didn't actually get the chance to use it during the episode.

03:17:10.960 --> 03:17:11.960
[Amit Varma]: So here is it.

03:17:11.960 --> 03:17:17.320
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to tell him, Pradeep sir, you write every day, so why is your name Pradeep Magazine?

03:17:17.320 --> 03:17:19.520
[Amit Varma]: Your name should be Pradeep Newspaper.

03:17:19.520 --> 03:17:20.520
[Amit Varma]: Sorry.

03:17:20.520 --> 03:17:24.240
[Amit Varma]: Now that's out of the way and Pradeep is not in front of me as I record this, so I can't

03:17:24.240 --> 03:17:25.420
[Amit Varma]: get whacked for it.

03:17:25.420 --> 03:17:29.960
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoyed listening to this episode and I really enjoyed recording it, do go over

03:17:29.960 --> 03:17:34.720
