00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.200
[Amit Varma]: This episode is being recorded on December 24th, and India is in ferment. Protests are

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.080
[Amit Varma]: ongoing across the country in response to this Government Citizenship Amendment Act,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.440
[Amit Varma]: and the state is cracking down on innocent and defenseless citizens with incredible violence.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.240
[Amit Varma]: The reports that have been coming out of UP, for example, are just horrendous. I had an

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.080
[Amit Varma]: episode last week with Srinath Raghavan that gave deep historical context to the notion

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.100
[Amit Varma]: of citizenship in India, the history of the NRC, the troubled history of Assam, the current

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.480
[Amit Varma]: consolidation of Hindutva, and student politics. I recommend you check that out. At this moment

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.640
[Amit Varma]: in time, all the focus is on the BJP's radical social agenda and all the dangers it poses

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.800
[Amit Varma]: for our nation. So why am I doing an episode on economics? Because I believe economics

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.000
[Amit Varma]: matters. People often think of economics as an arcane, abstract subject, numbers and graphs

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.840
[Amit Varma]: floating in the air above us that don't actually have an impact on people's lives. That could

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.360
[Amit Varma]: not be further from the truth. Everything in our lives is shaped by economics, and often

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.200
[Amit Varma]: by economic policies we cannot control, decided somewhere far off by social engineers who

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.760
[Amit Varma]: believe they can design society, influenced by special interests who are experts at redistributing

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.480
[Amit Varma]: money from the poor to the rich. This is not a problem of this government alone. For decades,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.720
[Amit Varma]: we have suffered from bad economics, and the poor have suffered the most. Perhaps that's

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.440
[Amit Varma]: why we have even normalized it, and we take it for granted. But we must not. Bad economics

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:48.240
[Unknown]: has a humanitarian cost. Economics matters. Welcome to the scene and the unseen. Our weekly

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.640
[Unknown]: podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science. Please welcome your host, Amit Varma.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.240
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. One of the reasons that the BJP won in 2014 was a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.320
[Amit Varma]: consequence of the bad economics of previous governments, especially the UPA right before

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.600
[Amit Varma]: it. Many people who voted for the BJP in 2014 did so assuming that they would not further

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.320
[Amit Varma]: the social agenda and they do economic reforms. Well, we can see what's happening on the social

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.680
[Amit Varma]: front. As for economics, at first they carried out no reforms at all. And then they progressively

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.680
[Amit Varma]: carried out what I can only describe as economic deforms, which only damaged the economy. I've

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.640
[Amit Varma]: had many episodes on demonetization and the botched implementation of GST, both of which

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.760
[Amit Varma]: basically helped devastate our economy. Those episodes will be linked from the show notes.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.760
[Amit Varma]: In a nutshell, instead of helping to free our markets further, we now have less free

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.560
[Amit Varma]: markets and lower growth. Mahatma Gandhi once said that he would judge every policy by what

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.960
[Amit Varma]: impact it had on the poorest of poor Indians. And that is exactly my yardstick. It has been

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.400
[Amit Varma]: estimated that every 1% of GDP growth in India takes 2 million people out of poverty. If

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.200
[Amit Varma]: that growth goes down, it has a humanitarian cost. It's a human tragedy. And that growth

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.880
[Amit Varma]: has unquestionably gone down in recent years. In this episode, as the year draws to a close,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.600
[Amit Varma]: I'm only going to focus on 2019. Where we started the year, what were our causes for

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.040
[Amit Varma]: hope and despair? And how have we performed through this year? My guest for this episode

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.820
[Amit Varma]: is Vivek Kaul, also known as the Shahrukh Khan of economics. Every time some news comes

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.160
[Amit Varma]: that has anything to do with the economy, there is an outpouring of requests on Twitter

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.920
[Amit Varma]: for Vivek's take on the matter. Vivek, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.280
[Amit Varma]: Thanks Amit for having me.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.240
[Amit Varma]: So as we are sort of, you know, one of the constant criticisms you get on Twitter from

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.680
[Amit Varma]: people is that Vivek, why don't you write about good news once in a while, it's always

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.560
[Amit Varma]: bad news, bad news. What's your response to that?

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.560
[Guest]: I mean, as I tweeted out recently, if you want good news, you should follow the Twitter

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.800
[Guest]: handle of the Press Information Bureau, and the various ministries of the Government of

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.560
[Amit Varma]: India. I mean, they'll give you all the good news that you want. So yeah.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.360
[Amit Varma]: And I guess what you do as an economist, we just look at the numbers and talk about what

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.920
[Guest]: the numbers show. And if then what

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:12.040
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, so broadly, yes, I mean, which is how it is. And at least in the last few

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.640
[Guest]: years, I mean, since demonetization happened, there is hardly been anything good to talk

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.800
[Guest]: about. I mean, a couple of things notwithstanding, I mean, like, if you look at how the insolvency

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.600
[Guest]: and the bankruptcy code has gone, it can be called sort of a partial success. I mean,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.720
[Guest]: despite the fact that it was launched with very little preparation, and the fact that

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.920
[Guest]: our legal system wasn't really, you know, ready for it, it has managed to deliver a

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.320
[Guest]: few good things, especially given the fact that some of the largest corporates who had

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.240
[Guest]: defaulted on their loans, have lost control of the companies. And I think that is very,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.300
[Guest]: very important, because you know, more than the recovery, I mean, recovery is important.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.260
[Guest]: But even if recovery does not happen, and decent recovery doesn't happen, and corporates

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.960
[Guest]: lose control of the company, the message that it sends across is very, very strong. So,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.360
[Guest]: in the years to come, any corporate who previously has been in the habit of defaulting on loans

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.800
[Guest]: and getting away with it, will think more than twice, you know, before doing anything

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.600
[Guest]: like that, because he's likely to lose control of his company. So, I think that's one good

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.000
[Guest]: thing that's clearly happened in the last few years.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.120
[Guest]: The other good thing, again, I mean, this is not something specific to this year, but

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.880
[Guest]: so, you know, up until a few years back, there used to be a funny home loan deduction that

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.440
[Guest]: used to be available to the taxpayer. So, if you bought your first home, the total interest

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.080
[Guest]: that you could take as a deduction was limited to around one and a half lakh rupees, which

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.200
[Guest]: was later raised to two lakh rupees. But if you bought your second, third, fourth, fifth,

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.880
[Guest]: sixth, or whatever your 10th home, the entire interest on your home loan could be taken

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.440
[Guest]: as a deduction from your taxable income, as long as you declared a notional rent. And

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.400
[Guest]: this was a huge tax saving device for especially for people at senior levels in corporate India.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.200
[Guest]: And I mean, the one thing that I never sort of figured out is was why should the government

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:32.360
[Guest]: of India encourage people to buy a second, third or a fourth home? I mean, I can understand

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.600
[Guest]: encouraging people to buy their first home and giving them a limited tax deduction. But

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.200
[Guest]: so, so Arun Jaitley did away with that in one of the budgets. I thought that was also

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.880
[Guest]: a great move. So, these are, you know, two good decisions that I can immediately think

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.880
[Amit Varma]: about. So,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.480
[Amit Varma]: And, and, you know, and I, of course, don't have any home. So, none of this makes a difference

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:02.040
[Amit Varma]: to me. But the largest question I'm going to ask is, you know, as someone who's commented

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.680
[Amit Varma]: on economics for a decade and a half, what happens to the economy is often a consequence

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.320
[Amit Varma]: of decisions taken long ago, there's a big lag sometimes between an economic policy actually

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.920
[Amit Varma]: being announced and implemented, and then with the results of that being failed. And

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, one example of this, which people doubt is that some of Vajpayee's reforms,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.280
[Amit Varma]: they started actually showing the effects only in UPA 1 and the UPA 1 gets credit for

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.040
[Amit Varma]: those numbers. And similarly, a lot of what has gone wrong with the economy today, in

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.040
[Amit Varma]: a sense started with the bad loans, so to say, the phono loans policy of the UPA 2 government,

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.760
[Amit Varma]: especially when Pranab Mukherjee was finance minister. And I of course, had a great episode

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.080
[Amit Varma]: with Pooja Mehra, which really elaborates on those sort of events in granular detail.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.600
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of what is what 2019 started with a lot of what we have seen unfolding through

00:07:52.600 --> 00:08:01.400
[Amit Varma]: 2019, and tell me if you agree, is essentially the inevitable consequences of DEMON and the

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.680
[Amit Varma]: botched implementation of GST. Like we thought at least I thought that DEMON, when it was

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.800
[Amit Varma]: announced, I thought on the same day that this is going to devastate the economy. But

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.000
[Amit Varma]: it took a while for that to actually happen. Or if it did happen immediately, it took a

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.600
[Amit Varma]: while for those numbers to come. But this year, there can pretty much be no doubt that

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.960
[Amit Varma]: the full consequences of the bad economic management of the last few years is now unfolding.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.960
[Guest]: What do you think?

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.640
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, I mean, I agree with you completely on that. See, I think what happens is and

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.320
[Guest]: this is, you know, more anecdotal than data driven. And because I've seen some of my friends

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.600
[Guest]: struggle with it, you know, when you're running a small enterprise, and you start facing headwinds,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.080
[Guest]: you don't shut it down immediately, right? Because I mean, you started it, and that's

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.320
[Guest]: the only thing you do. So it takes time for you to sort of realize that this is not working.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.640
[Guest]: Now, I guess that's, that's something that's happened because of one demonetization and

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:01.000
[Guest]: the botched up implementation of GST. The informal sector and the smaller players in

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.480
[Guest]: the formal sector have over a period of last two to three years, been facing a lot of pressure

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:13.240
[Guest]: on the performance front. And that pressure is now, you know, starting to show and it's

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.640
[Guest]: triggered into the overall broader economy as well. Yeah, I mean, I would agree with

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.120
[Amit Varma]: that completely.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.840
[Amit Varma]: And the thing to remember here is also that economists use a term called welfare shocks.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.720
[Amit Varma]: And what is a welfare shock? What happens is that when something like demonetization

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:33.600
[Amit Varma]: happens, and, you know, somebody who's running a business on the margins in the informal

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.840
[Amit Varma]: sector, and remember, he's on the informal sector, not because he wants to evade the

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.120
[Amit Varma]: law, but because of the panoply of bad laws and regulations we have, which force many

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.240
[Amit Varma]: entrepreneurs into the informal sector. And if someone on the margins like that goes out

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.480
[Amit Varma]: of business, it is not the case that when the economy gets back, he can just, you know,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.600
[Amit Varma]: come back and start the business again. Like, for example, I may have a business running

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.920
[Amit Varma]: two ACs, I can't afford to run two, I start running one, when things get better, I put

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.360
[Amit Varma]: the second AC back on. But that's not how this works. These people suffer what is called

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.880
[Amit Varma]: welfare shocks, where once they are done, they are completely done. And you know, they

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.480
[Amit Varma]: just don't come back, they're down for good, they just fall from that status level, they

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.280
[Amit Varma]: might go slip back below the poverty line, if that's where they came from. And the other

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.920
[Amit Varma]: problem there, and I'm also going to ask you about this, is that it's very hard for people

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.400
[Amit Varma]: to get a grip on it, because there is actually no data from the informal sector.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.600
[Guest]: Yes, so there's very little data that actually comes out in a formal way for the informal

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:34.080
[Guest]: sector. But there are enough, I mean, if you look at a lot of the industry, small industry

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.160
[Guest]: associations, they have put out a lot of data over the last few years, which tells you that

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:46.120
[Guest]: a lot of small enterprises have been destroyed in the aftermath of demonetization and a botched

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.680
[Guest]: up implementation of the GST. I mean, you know, a great example is a place like Tirupur,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:57.360
[Guest]: which used to be a global hub for producing t-shirts. And, you know, the mess that the

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:04.080
[Guest]: city got into after demonetization is very well documented. And a lot of players operating

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:10.880
[Guest]: in Tirupur were basically, you know, small players who sort of employed up to 50 people.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:16.720
[Guest]: So, you know, bits and parts of it are pretty well documented. Obviously, it's not documented

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:23.520
[Guest]: at an overall economic level. Having said that, you know, the interesting thing is,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.600
[Guest]: you know, when demonetization happened, most corporates like the idea because what they

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:35.480
[Guest]: thought was that the informal sector will now get formalized, and they will benefit

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:40.320
[Guest]: because of it because their business will go up. But what they did not realize was that

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.400
[Guest]: if the informal sector of the country gets destroyed, the purchasing power or the consumption

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.640
[Guest]: power of people who used to work in that informal sector also comes down. You know, and that

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:58.840
[Guest]: has also impacted the corporate revenues and earnings in a big way over the last few years.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.520
[Guest]: Another point I wanted to make here was that, you know, this and I mean, this is something

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:09.720
[Guest]: I've said before, but it is important to say it again, is that over the years, you know,

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.920
[Guest]: the informal sector in India has often been linked to the black economy, right? Which

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:20.200
[Guest]: is partly true. Yes, I mean, people who are making money there do not pay income tax,

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.920
[Guest]: but you also need to take into account the fact that a lot of people or in fact, most

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:30.560
[Guest]: of the people who work in the informal sector do not make enough money to be paying income

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:36.400
[Guest]: tax. So while the owner himself may be waiting on tax, you know, people who work there, I

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.040
[Guest]: mean, they don't need to pay tax, but and they do pay tax, indirect tax, like we all

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.100
[Guest]: do. So, so I think these are, you know, some points that people need to realize that nothing

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.680
[Guest]: is all black, because, you know, ultimately, when black money is also spent, you know,

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:58.080
[Guest]: the guy who earns it, at some level does pay tax on it. I mean, it's it may not be a direct

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.320
[Guest]: tax, but he's definitely paying an indirect tax.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.000
[Amit Varma]: No, and you brought up a very interesting point there in passing, which I want to elaborate

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.080
[Amit Varma]: on very briefly, which is actually triggered by something I saw on Twitter today, which

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.760
[Amit Varma]: is a post by Kangana Ranaut, where she's talking about the alleged violence done by protesters.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.920
[Amit Varma]: And she's saying only 3% of us pay tax and the rest of the people are freeloaders. And

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.680
[Amit Varma]: the point is, no, you know, only a small percentage pays income tax. But every single person in

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.280
[Amit Varma]: this country plays tax in some sort of the other every time you buy a little bit of salt,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.240
[Amit Varma]: or you buy a bar of soap, you are paying tax, we are all participants in this democracy,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.240
[Amit Varma]: and we all have a stake.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.520
[Guest]: And also, there's an interesting point, you know, I mean, some point to that point, which

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:44.200
[Guest]: is that, you know, this three to 4% number, paying income tax is also extremely exaggerated,

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:50.000
[Guest]: because the bulk of individual income tax is paid by when I done a calculation some

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.560
[Guest]: time back, around 0.26% of India's population pays around 80% of its individual income tax.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:05.000
[Guest]: So it's not even three or 4%. But having said that, everybody pays indirect tax. No, I mean,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.080
[Guest]: if such a small proportion of people pay income tax in the country, what it shows is, one,

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:17.440
[Guest]: the general poverty of the country, and two, the fact that our income tax department has

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:24.560
[Guest]: really not been up to the mark and a bad tax policies, which, you know, at some level over

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.040
[Guest]: the years have led to a situation where people simply they feel they're dealing in black

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.080
[Amit Varma]: rather than dealing with the, with the system and dealing in black being part of the informal

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.080
[Amit Varma]: sector actually carries significant costs. So the very fact that people tend to do so

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:44.720
[Amit Varma]: should, you know, show you how onerous regulatory structures are, do they feel the need to somehow

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.920
[Amit Varma]: kind of stay out of it, you know, like before we get to 2019, of course, just to sort of

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.520
[Amit Varma]: set the context, I was chatting with a couple of my friends about, you know, this episode

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.000
[Amit Varma]: that I'm talking to Vivek, is there something you'd like me to discuss? And one of them

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.560
[Amit Varma]: Devanshu Dutta said, hey, please ask him about how much the phrase he used, I really liked

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.560
[Amit Varma]: it was a forced formalization, how much the forced formalization attempted by the government

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.360
[Amit Varma]: has contributed to this and forced formalization was, of course, the one of the stated intents

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.960
[Amit Varma]: of demonetization that bring the informal into the formal sector, to which another of

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.600
[Amit Varma]: my friends, Mohit Satyanand, and both of these guys have been on my show before. And Mohit

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:26.640
[Amit Varma]: Satyanand said that he wouldn't call it forced formalization as much as forced exits, because

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.840
[Amit Varma]: what demon forced many people to do was exit rather than formalize.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.560
[Guest]: Yeah, so which is precisely the point I was making, you know, corporates, the big corporates

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.360
[Guest]: were initially very happy, because they thought that, you know, formalization will now happen

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.560
[Guest]: and they'll benefit. But what has happened is that, while the informal sector has been

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.400
[Guest]: destroyed, that business hasn't moved to the formal sector, simply because when the informal

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.280
[Guest]: sector gets destroyed, you know, a lot of people lose their jobs, the purchasing power

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.280
[Guest]: comes down. And once the purchasing power comes down, at some level, it does impact

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:03.080
[Guest]: consumption. And that leads to a situation where corporates do not benefit from, you

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.680
[Guest]: know, forced formalization. But as Mohit rightly put it, it's more of forced exits. So, which

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.240
[Guest]: is what has happened in the last few years.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.600
[Amit Varma]: So, basically, there's a Procter and Gamble, which is making soap, which is making whatever

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.680
[Amit Varma]: it makes, and suddenly people are buying less of that, because they are in the, they have

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.680
[Guest]: to make.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.000
[Guest]: And there's data to back that up. So, if you look at, so, you know, you look at Hindustan

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.080
[Guest]: Unilever, which is, you know, good benchmark for anything in the consumption economy in

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.480
[Guest]: India. So, if you look at the volume growth, which is basically the growth in the number

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:40.440
[Guest]: of units, they sell and not the revenue. So, that was in 2018, the unit growth was 10 to

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:47.600
[Guest]: 12%. This year, it's come down to 5%. So, that tells you that the pace of FMCG growth

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:53.600
[Guest]: has halved. So, that is a, that's a huge thing. So, that should tell you that all this, you

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.440
[Guest]: know, these theories of forced formalization haven't really worked.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.960
[Amit Varma]: So, and my other question to you is that you're someone who watches the economy very closely,

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.160
[Amit Varma]: right? Now, we know that a lot of the numbers that the government puts out are extremely

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.880
[Amit Varma]: unreliable. And, you know, even with something like the GDP numbers, even if you take the

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.800
[Amit Varma]: GDP numbers, say at face value, and I had a long episode with Rajeshwari Sengupta on

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.720
[Amit Varma]: this where we discuss why they cannot be taken at face value, but going deeper into the problems

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.040
[Amit Varma]: with GDP as a measure itself. One of the things we agreed on, and one of the things which

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.080
[Amit Varma]: was debated when the GDP was first mooted was should it include government spending

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.840
[Amit Varma]: in it or not. And because you know, it was a measure implemented just before the Second

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.960
[Amit Varma]: World War, the decision that was taken, if I remember correctly, against the advice of

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:41.040
[Amit Varma]: Simon Kuznets, who in a sense was the father of the GDP, was that, no, let's include government

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.200
[Amit Varma]: spending in it. But the problem with that is that if the GDP is being used as a measure

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:51.040
[Amit Varma]: of economic growth, that is an incentive for the government in power to spend more because

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:56.360
[Amit Varma]: all that spend gets counted. And it may be ineffective spending, it may even be destructive

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:02.520
[Amit Varma]: spending. You know, like you would actually, you know, the GDP would grow if you simply,

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.600
[Amit Varma]: you know, build bridges and blew them up and just reiterated that forever, the GDP would

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.460
[Amit Varma]: keep growing. And what has happened? And like, do you therefore feel a need to pass these

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:16.760
[Amit Varma]: numbers more closely, especially the GDP and say, okay, how much of this is just government

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.760
[Amit Varma]: spending? And how much of this is society itself?

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:27.240
[Guest]: Okay, you know, so there are two answers to this question. One is, given the unreliability

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:35.000
[Guest]: of the GDP numbers since January 2015, when we moved on to a new method, a simple way

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.840
[Guest]: to get around that is to look at a broad set of economic indicators. Now, while those indicators

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:47.000
[Guest]: may not give you this one number to come to a conclusion, like, you know, GDP does, it

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.080
[Guest]: gives you a better feel of the way the overall economy is headed. So, I'll substantiate this

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:58.560
[Guest]: with an example. So, sometime in late March, I think early April, not late March, I wrote

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:04.800
[Guest]: this piece for the Mint, wherein I said that India is getting into a consumption slowdown,

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:11.360
[Guest]: okay. And so, when I said this, a lot of people didn't buy it, but then that's that's a different

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:16.480
[Guest]: story for another day. But, you know, the way I caught it was simply because, you know,

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:26.160
[Guest]: I looked at car sales, I looked at scooter sales, motorcycle sales, moped sales, tractor

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:34.320
[Guest]: sales and commercial vehicle sales. So, six kinds of vehicle sales for different sections

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:40.920
[Guest]: of the society. So, car sales, a very urban phenomenon, motorcycle sales, both rural and

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:46.480
[Guest]: urban. Scooter sales, primarily more urban, more women. Moped, obviously, you know, for

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:53.760
[Guest]: people who cannot buy bikes and scooters. Tractor sales, rural rich. And commercial

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.400
[Guest]: vehicle sales, basically, you know, a good indicator of whether investment is happening

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:05.800
[Guest]: in the economy or not. So, all the six indicators had fallen, okay. And this hadn't happened

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:11.000
[Guest]: in five years. I mean, I had data for five years, it may not have happened even beyond

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.560
[Guest]: that. So, what that told me was that there's something which is not right. Now, the GDP

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:23.160
[Guest]: data would have never caught on to something like this, right. So, that's one part. So,

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.320
[Guest]: you have to obviously, you know, if you want to do serious economic analysis, you can't

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.600
[Guest]: rely on just one indicator, you have to look at multiple indicators. You have to look at

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.120
[Guest]: government indicators, you have to look at private indicators, you have to look at theoretical

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:42.280
[Guest]: constructs like the GDP is like the inflation is and you also have to look at high frequency,

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:47.680
[Guest]: you know, economic indicators like car sales, and two wheeler sales and so on. So, that's

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.480
[Guest]: one part of it. The second part is government spending. So, one exercise which I always

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.920
[Guest]: carry out and that again has helped me quite a lot in getting the, you know, the economic

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:04.840
[Guest]: scene right is, see, GDP has four constituents, right. Primarily, you have consumption expenditure,

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:11.600
[Guest]: which is the major part of the Indian economy, with close to around 58-59%. Then you have

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:18.640
[Guest]: investment, which is down to around 28%, 28-29%. Then you have government expenditure, which

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:24.400
[Guest]: varies anywhere from 8 to 12%. Now, it's like close to 13%. And you have net exports, which

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.400
[Guest]: is exports minus imports and is negative in the Indian case. So, a good thing to do while

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:35.480
[Guest]: analysing GDP numbers is to just get rid of government expenditure, okay. Subtract that

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:40.200
[Guest]: government expenditure from the overall GDP number. And what you get is non-government

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.920
[Guest]: GDP. I mean, you can call it private GDP, you can call it whatever you want to, but

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:50.640
[Guest]: or actual GDP, or as Kuznets GDP, because that's how he would have made it. That's how

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:56.960
[Guest]: he had imagined it. That's how he wanted it. So, if you look at that number, that gives

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:04.000
[Guest]: you a better indication. So, like, if you look at the first six months of 2019-20, the

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.800
[Guest]: GDP growth is 4.8%, whereas the non-government GDP growth is 3.8%. Wow, that's a big difference

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:16.440
[Guest]: is 100 basis points. And that brings me to the point that I try making all the time,

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.860
[Guest]: but nobody really seems to get it is. So, you know, whenever an economy is in trouble

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:26.840
[Guest]: and not just Indian economy, economists want the government to spend more money. I mean,

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:32.040
[Guest]: this is something that comes from John Maynard Keynes. But what Keynes had said, and I mean,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:37.080
[Guest]: obviously, I mean, I call it the bastardization of Keynes. Keynes had essentially called for

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:42.520
[Guest]: savings during good time, and then spending that money in bad time. Now, obviously, no

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:47.280
[Guest]: government saves money. I mean, all of them run a fiscal deficit. So, now, if you look

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:54.180
[Guest]: at data for the last three years, the growth in the Indian economy has been driven largely

00:22:54.180 --> 00:23:00.220
[Guest]: by government expenditure. So, the government expenditure in 17-18 increased by around 15%.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:06.760
[Guest]: And these are real GDP growth numbers not, you know, adjusted for inflation. So, government

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:15.560
[Guest]: expenditure went up by 15% in 17-18, around 9.3, 9.4% in 18-19. And in 19-20, I think,

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:21.200
[Guest]: in the first six months, it's grown by 12.7%. So, the point is, you know, it's not like

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:28.640
[Guest]: so the government is already spending a lot of money. And that has been driving the GDP

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.640
[Guest]: growth number. I mean, as I said, if you take out government expenditure from the GDP, the

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.640
[Guest]: growth this year is 100 basis points lower. Now, the question that no one seems to be

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.640
[Guest]: asking is, and I also don't have a sort of a correct answer for this is that, where is

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.880
[Guest]: this money going? Right? Because if they're spending this money, it has to go somewhere,

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.840
[Guest]: you'd want to see some of it come back in the economy and create some kind of, so where

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:59.400
[Guest]: is this money going? Now, I have a sort of a theory on it. And so, a lot of this money

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:06.040
[Guest]: essentially is going towards buying rice and wheat, you know, which the Food Corporation

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.840
[Guest]: of India buys and distributes through the public distribution system. But if you look

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:20.800
[Guest]: at FCI data, you will realise that the organisation stores much more rice and wheat than is required.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.180
[Guest]: So, in that way, we're basically buying rice and wheat from large farmers, giving them

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:31.040
[Guest]: that money. And then that rice and wheat is essentially rotting in the go downs of FCI.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.520
[Amit Varma]: Because the purpose of buying them was not to feed people, but to just to buy that money,

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.720
[Guest]: just to buy that. Now, imagine that a few years back, I had done this calculation, and

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.000
[Guest]: I'm not sure whether if the number is still that, but the broader theory is still right.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.280
[Guest]: And I'd found that around the excess stocks with Food Corporation of India, 80,000 crore

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:55.440
[Guest]: rupees worth of excess rice and wheat were lying in the go downs of FCI. I mean, this

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.320
[Guest]: is when you had accounted for the strategic reserve as well that every nation needs to

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:06.600
[Guest]: maintain. So, now imagine that 80,000 crore rupees going somewhere else. And, you know,

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.960
[Guest]: let's say it just goes towards building four lane highway.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.880
[Amit Varma]: Or it's raised in the pockets of customers who it was whatever I mean, I mean, I'm even

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:20.680
[Amit Varma]: okay with the four lane highway, you know, in this recent speech that you made in Bangalore,

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.360
[Amit Varma]: you gave an illustration of how high the opportunity cost of this sort of money can be. And you

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.360
[Amit Varma]: use four lane highways.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:33.400
[Guest]: Yeah, so that four lane highway example was from Vijay Kelkar and Ajay Shah's book, the

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:38.480
[Amit Varma]: new book, In Service of the Republic. I recorded with them last week, but that episode will

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.040
[Amit Varma]: be coming out after this one that will release on Jan 6, incredible book, it's a masterpiece

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.280
[Guest]: and great episode and you should read it. So anyway, so the Mr. Kelkar and Mr. Shah

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:53.240
[Guest]: point out that it costs rupees 1 lakh crore to build a 10,000 kilometre four lane highway.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:59.100
[Guest]: Okay. Now, so with around 80,000 crore of excess rice and wheat with FCI, you basically

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:05.160
[Guest]: lost out on around 8000 kilometres of a four lane highway. Now, the example I used in the

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:11.080
[Guest]: speech was slightly different. I mean, I had compared four lane highways with the amount

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:17.800
[Guest]: the total amount of money that the government has been spending in order to recapitalize

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:24.080
[Guest]: public sector banks and to keep them going in the last few years. So between 1718, 1819

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:30.000
[Guest]: and 1920, the government would have ended up spending close to 270,000 crores to keep

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.920
[Guest]: these banks going. So which basically means 27,000 kilometres of four lane highways,

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.960
[Amit Varma]: which has massive what economists would call massive positive externalities on the economy

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.000
[Guest]: because you exactly you know, I mean, this does not mean that you let go of all public

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.400
[Guest]: sector banks and allow them to go bust. But at the same time, there is no need for the

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.120
[Guest]: government to be you know, running banks like Dena Bank and Indian Overseas Bank and United

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.800
[Guest]: Bank. You know, I mean, some of these banks have now been merged away. No, and in fact,

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, like when we think of government spending, I'd like people to think along two

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:07.160
[Amit Varma]: lines. One is beyond the obvious point one is just a simple moral cost of government

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.600
[Amit Varma]: money itself. Every rupee that the government has is coerced from someone that carries a

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.080
[Amit Varma]: moral cost, the person it is coerced from, which is some taxpayer who is buying a bar

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:21.080
[Amit Varma]: of soap or salt or whatever, that taxpayer could have found an alternative use for it,

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.160
[Amit Varma]: which would have contributed to their welfare. And surely which they would know more about

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.400
[Amit Varma]: than you would that's that's one.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.400
[Guest]: Let me just take this forward. So where is this money to recapitalize government banks

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:40.640
[Guest]: coming from? It's been coming from the excise duty that we pay on petrol and diesel. Okay.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:46.160
[Guest]: So in that way, every petrol and diesel buyer in India direct or indirect, I mean, indirectly,

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.720
[Guest]: we all buy petrol and diesel, right? Even though we may not have vehicles, but let's

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:56.680
[Guest]: say we go to buy, you know, vegetables somewhere. So that cost of transport is built into the

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:03.680
[Guest]: price of that vegetable, right? So indirectly, all of us are essentially paying a sort of

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:10.520
[Guest]: a premium. Every time you know, we buy anything to bail out the public sector banks in India

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:16.720
[Guest]: now. So there's another angle to it. Now the angle is, India produces very little of the

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.480
[Guest]: oil that it consumes. Okay, we import close to 85% of the oil now. And at the same time,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.360
[Guest]: you know, our exports have sort of fallen over the years. So one of the things that

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.520
[Guest]: people regularly talk about, and especially when it comes to, you know, low value exports,

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.960
[Guest]: in order to get them going, you need to let the rupee depreciate. The problem with letting

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.520
[Guest]: the rupee depreciate is the moment you let the rupee depreciate, your petrol and diesel

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:47.640
[Guest]: prices start to go up. Okay. Now, one way of ensuring that the petrol and diesel prices

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:53.800
[Guest]: wouldn't go up is by cutting down the excise duty on it. But the moment you cut excise

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:59.560
[Guest]: duty on it, how do you finance the recapitalization of public sector banks? So the moral of the

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:04.040
[Guest]: story is that I mean, the direct effects in economics are very, very obvious. But it's

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:08.640
[Guest]: the indirect effects, which actually hurt the economy more.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.640
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I would say that there's no moral in the story. There's an immoral in the story.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.960
[Amit Varma]: To continue with sort of the two part point I was making very quickly about government

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.760
[Amit Varma]: spending is one, of course, that all government spending carries a moral cost because of the

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.960
[Amit Varma]: coercive effect of acquiring that money, which is why whatever you which doesn't mean that

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.160
[Amit Varma]: government should not exist, we need it. But before we needed to protect our rights to

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.480
[Amit Varma]: begin with, but before you recommend any kind of government spending on anything, you have

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:40.160
[Amit Varma]: to firstly justify that moral cost. Now, assuming that you do that, the next step that then

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.840
[Amit Varma]: comes is you have to think about the opportunity cost of that spending. Like you just gave

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:50.080
[Amit Varma]: a great example of it Vivek, when you spoke about how the 8000 kilometres of four lane

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.440
[Amit Varma]: National Highway, but essentially, the opportunity cost can be anything if the money just stayed

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.680
[Amit Varma]: with the people it was coerced from, in the name of taxes, they would spend it in their

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.040
[Amit Varma]: own lives, it would be their consumption. That is also a cost, there is also a crowding

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:07.860
[Amit Varma]: out effect of such money, and various kinds of indirect effects as you know, of which,

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:13.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, you just give one excellent sort of example. So, you know, like you just said,

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.800
[Amit Varma]: in March, you wrote this piece about how there's a consumption crisis and nobody believed you.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.880
[Amit Varma]: In August, I recorded an episode with our friend Mohit Satyanand on, I mean, the episode

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:27.480
[Amit Varma]: was called to economic crisis 2008 and 2019. And at that point, people were still in denial

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.240
[Amit Varma]: that we are in a crisis. To some extent, but I think there's a slightly greater awareness

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.240
[Amit Varma]: that higher crisis.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:41.480
[Guest]: Yeah, but now the spin is that it's not a structural thing. And, you know, is there

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.000
[Guest]: something to that? I mean, there'll always be something to that. But, you know, it's

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.640
[Guest]: not just because of that. I mean, so there's a very long answer to this question. And I

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:54.440
[Guest]: think there are two answers. So the first part, where the global excuse has been used

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:59.560
[Guest]: over and over again is essentially when it comes to our exports. And, you know, when

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:09.760
[Guest]: it comes to exports, the exports of India have sort of fallen from around 25% of the

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:19.800
[Guest]: GDP in 2011-12 to around 19.7% in 2018-19. Now, you know, as I keep saying over and over

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:25.080
[Guest]: again, you know, no country in the history of economic development has gone from being

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:32.640
[Guest]: a developing country to becoming a developed country without a successful export sector.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.040
[Guest]: Okay. I mean, maybe India has some new model brewing, but at least it's not happened up

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.400
[Guest]: until now.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:46.880
[Guest]: And also, I mean, if you look at our two previous growth spurts between 92-97 and 2003 and 2011,

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:52.000
[Guest]: that was, I mean, I wouldn't say largely driven by the export sector, but the export sector

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.920
[Guest]: played a very important role in it. Also, the export sector tends to create a lot of

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:06.080
[Guest]: jobs for what we call the MSMEs, you know, micro, small and medium enterprises, which

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:12.240
[Guest]: have traditionally provided around 35-40% of goods exports. So, it's very, so, you know,

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:19.040
[Guest]: so it creates a lot of economic growth. Also, within the export sector, sectors like textile,

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:25.560
[Guest]: okay. So, textile is a very important sector because it creates jobs for women. And especially

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:30.400
[Guest]: given the fact that our female labour force participation rate has fallen dramatically

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:35.900
[Guest]: over the years, where, which basically means that lesser and lesser women who are a part

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:42.280
[Guest]: of the workforce are actually going out and working. Now, the excuse that has been offered

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:48.600
[Guest]: in case of the export sector is that, no boss, it's a global phenomenon and blah, blah, blah.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.240
[Guest]: But that's not true. So, I mean, so recently, Dr. Shankar Acharya, who, you know, he's

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:59.160
[Guest]: a senior economist and a former chief economic advisor, he wrote in a column in the Business

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:06.520
[Guest]: Standard and I quote, so between 2011 and 2018, India's goods exports increased by only

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:16.280
[Guest]: 8%, okay. In sharp contrast, Vietnam's exports grew by 154%, Cambodia's by 114%, Myanmar's

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:24.800
[Guest]: by 82%, Bangladesh's by 61%, the Philippines by 40%, and even China on such a large base

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:32.160
[Guest]: by 31%. So, obviously, what this tells you is that our export sector has been unable

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:40.720
[Guest]: to compete internationally. And that's the long and the short of it. I mean, you know,

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:46.680
[Guest]: obviously, you know, the global slowdown has some sort of a impact, but largely our exports

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:53.120
[Guest]: have slowed down because we are unable to compete internationally. And, you know, I

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.360
[Guest]: mean, to compete internationally, I mean, this is very, very obvious and cliched and

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:03.880
[Guest]: has been said over and over again, reforms are required on the land, labor, capital,

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.880
[Amit Varma]: and tax front.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.080
[Guest]: Which many hoped in 2014 that Modi would finally do, but he hasn't.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:14.140
[Guest]: Except for, you know, reducing corporate income tax rates. Now, even, you know, for competing

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:20.240
[Guest]: within the country, the entrepreneurs need to pay a fair price for electricity and freight.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:27.040
[Guest]: Now, the cost of cheap electricity right now in India for farmers is borne by the industry.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:31.980
[Guest]: Along similar lines, railway passengers are subsidized at the cost of freight. The taxes

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:36.640
[Guest]: on aviation fuel have ensured that air cargo rates in India are one of the highest in the

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:43.840
[Guest]: world. So, I mean, these are fundamental anomalies which need to be set right, and they cannot

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:49.000
[Guest]: be set right overnight. And on top of this, we have a GST services tax system, which is

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.560
[Guest]: in a mess. Now, in fact, Kelkar and Shah have a very interesting point in the book where

00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:01.520
[Guest]: they say that 80% of countries which introduced the GST after 1995 have opted for a single

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:08.040
[Guest]: rate GST. And this is a fundamental point which our lawmakers do not seem to get. I

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:13.520
[Guest]: mean, you know, we are still stuck in sin goods and it's not, you know, it's about the

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:21.080
[Guest]: overall simplicity of the system. So, I can understand two rates, but the current, you

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:27.400
[Guest]: know, paraphernalia is, in fact, now we have a funny situation wherein the GST on inputs,

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:33.360
[Guest]: a lot of inputs is greater than the GST on the final consumption good. So, because of

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:39.640
[Guest]: that, a lot of companies are getting refunds. And so, it tells you this is the problem of

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:45.680
[Guest]: launching a system, you know, and wanting to give a bhashan at midnight and claiming

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:51.480
[Guest]: that it's a big victory without really planning for it properly.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.120
[Amit Varma]: And unless someone say that, oh, this is in hindsight that we know the problems people

00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:01.320
[Amit Varma]: have been working on. Exactly. So, the truth is that, out of the many episodes I have done

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:06.000
[Amit Varma]: on GST on the scene and the unseen, the first one was before GST was implemented with our

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.320
[Amit Varma]: good friend Devanshu Dutta and Devanshu identified exactly the problems that have eventually

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:16.040
[Amit Varma]: turned out to be problems. Everything was foreseen, not just by Devanshu and me, but

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:21.280
[Amit Varma]: by all good economists. But this government, of course, does not value expertise as we

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:28.060
[Amit Varma]: have found out again and again. Moving on from this, you know, another sort of very

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:32.800
[Amit Varma]: interesting point that you made in your speech and that harks back to a book that both of

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:40.280
[Amit Varma]: us have been reading and talking about, Narrative Economics by Schiller, is about how the mentality

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.400
[Amit Varma]: of consumers can lead to vicious cycles in the economy which just keep it going more

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.720
[Amit Varma]: and more further down. And you've used a historical analogy of this with the Great

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.920
[Amit Varma]: Depression of 1929. Can you can you elaborate a bit on that?

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:57.920
[Guest]: Sure. Before I talk about narrative economics, I think Robert Schiller is this one economist

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:03.120
[Guest]: who gets these broad predictions right. I mean, very few economists get, you know, as

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:08.080
[Guest]: the old joke goes that economists predicted nine out of the last five recessions. So Schiller

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:14.840
[Guest]: got the 2000 stock market bubble right and even got the real estate bubble of 2008. Right.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:20.280
[Guest]: So in narrative economics, he basically sort of the core point of the book is that how

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:26.360
[Guest]: the narratives that human beings create in their heads and in their lives, essentially

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:34.000
[Guest]: end up impacting the overall economy. So the example he gives is that of the Great Depression

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.520
[Guest]: of 1929. And I'll quote him. He says that in the four years after 1929, GDP per cent,

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:46.960
[Guest]: which is per capita income, went down by a catastrophic 20 percent. It's not called the

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:53.520
[Guest]: Great Depression for nothing. But at the same time, the sales of new cars of by the Ford

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:59.800
[Guest]: Motor Company fell by 86 percent. So per capita income went down by 20 percent, but car sales

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:05.320
[Guest]: went down by 86 percent. Obviously, there was a disproportionate impact on car sales.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:10.320
[Guest]: Now, the question is, why did that happen? Now, you know, during the Great Depression,

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:17.120
[Guest]: close to 25 percent of the American labor force lost its jobs. They became unemployed.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:22.160
[Guest]: The absolute number was around 13 million. Now, what happened was what this told you

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:28.280
[Guest]: was that everyone knew someone else, you know, someone in the family, some close friend or

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:38.360
[Guest]: a relative who had lost a job. So this created what we can call the psychology of the slowdown.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:43.280
[Guest]: Right. So the bigger problem during the Great Depression was not I mean, obviously, you

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:49.760
[Guest]: know, people who lost their jobs had a problem. But the bigger problem in the minds of people

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:56.280
[Guest]: was the fear of losing a job and not being able to find another one. OK, because everyone

00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:02.800
[Guest]: knew someone who had lost a job and was just sitting at home and doing nothing. And this

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:09.320
[Guest]: started to influence their consumption decisions. So like Schiller writes, and I quote him,

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:15.580
[Guest]: some people postponed buying a car or other major consumer items and which led to a loss

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:20.320
[Guest]: of jobs in the auto and consumer products industries, which led to more people postponement,

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:26.380
[Guest]: which led to a second round of job losses, and so on for several years. Now, so it essentially,

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:32.400
[Guest]: you know, the psychology of the slowdown had set gotten into the minds of people. And that

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.680
[Guest]: created a bigger problem over the years. So what happens is a lot of people talk about

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.880
[Guest]: this in a very, you know, sort of a nondescript manner where they say, oh, it's all in the

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:46.680
[Guest]: mind. I mean, boss, when it gets into the mind, it becomes a bigger problem than the

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:50.000
[Amit Varma]: actual problem. And also the thing to note here is that it's not that they were worried

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.760
[Amit Varma]: about nothing. It's not like a tulip bubble or something like that. They had reason to

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.920
[Amit Varma]: be worried the economy was doing badly. But these are sort of the ripple effects of that

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:03.040
[Amit Varma]: worry, where they decide that, okay, things are going bad, my cousin is out of a job,

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.160
[Amit Varma]: God knows how long this will go on. I had better chill out a little bit and, you know,

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.600
[Guest]: cut back on the lifestyle. And that creates a vicious cycle. And so what that does is,

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:15.720
[Guest]: you know, when the consumer confidence goes down, the business confidence also falls very,

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:20.120
[Guest]: very quickly. So it's like, you know, like, Mr. Modi recently made a speech, I think,

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:26.920
[Guest]: at the 100 years of Asocham, which is a business lobby, and asked the industry to invest. Now,

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:31.400
[Guest]: the problem is, you know, I mean, you can ask the industry to invest, but the industry

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:36.720
[Guest]: is not there to, you know, for social service, right? So the industry will invest when people

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.600
[Guest]: will consume, because when they put money into something, they're looking for a certain

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.920
[Guest]: rate of return, which is higher than their cost of capital. I mean, the capital may be

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:52.680
[Guest]: equity, it may be debt. And in a scenario where the consumers are not interested in

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:59.560
[Guest]: consumption in the same way as they were in the past, expecting industry to invest is

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:04.640
[Guest]: problematic. I mean, there is there's a problem with that argument. I mean, as a government,

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:13.480
[Guest]: you can only sort of set a series of reforms in place and encourage the industry to invest.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.880
[Guest]: Now, whether the industry invests or not is, you know, depends on the industry when the

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:24.080
[Guest]: government cannot do much about it. So anyway, so once the consumer confidence goes down,

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.560
[Guest]: the business confidence also goes down very, very quickly. And when the business confidence

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.640
[Guest]: goes down, you know, tax collection becomes a problem, which is exactly how things are

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:37.480
[Guest]: playing out in India. I mean, if you look at the I mean, I have data for the first seven

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:42.520
[Guest]: months, I remember the tax collection, the gross tax revenue of the government has gone

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:51.680
[Guest]: up by around 1.5, 1.6%. Whereas in the budget, it is assumed to go by 18%. So that tells

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:58.640
[Guest]: you, I mean, if there is one data point that you need to look at, to sort of convince yourself

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:04.720
[Guest]: that there is an economic slowdown, this is it, because this is government data. And it

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:10.280
[Guest]: is a high frequency economic indicator published every month. It's not a theoretical construct

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:16.240
[Guest]: like the GDP is. So in this scenario, and obviously, you know, all of these points are

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:22.600
[Guest]: understood by the politicians of the day. Now, in 1929, what happened was that the American

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:28.160
[Guest]: President Calvin Coolidge tried to talk up the economy by, you know, saying things like

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.760
[Guest]: all is well, and you know, the stock market is doing well, and stuff like that. So, you

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:38.880
[Guest]: know, you had public officials, businessmen, journalists, all trying to talk up the economy.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:45.440
[Guest]: And there is this, again, there's this something that Schiller writes in his book. And he says

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:50.160
[Guest]: that this led one observer to quit because everyone was being so positive about the entire

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:55.480
[Guest]: thing. Unfortunately, there appears a strong tendency among writers on business subjects

00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:00.560
[Guest]: to put out nothing but optimistic statements, and to avoid all discussion that might be

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.520
[Guest]: construed as pessimism. I mean, I can vouch for the fact that, you know, one of the leading

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.760
[Guest]: business dailies in the country, or rather the leading business daily in the country

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:16.240
[Guest]: operates exactly like this. So their feeling is that if we keep saying all is well, ultimately,

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:22.200
[Guest]: all will become well. So because they believe they're so influential. So now, if you sort

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:27.800
[Guest]: of look at it, you know, if you compare this to what has been happening in India, the situation

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.920
[Guest]: is slightly similar, obviously, we are not in a depression, technically, we are not even

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:38.600
[Guest]: in a recession. Recession is when the economy contracts for two consecutive quarters. So

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:44.320
[Guest]: we are growing at a slower rate than we were in the past. So we are a part of a slowdown,

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:50.160
[Guest]: or what former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan called a growth recession. So the moment he

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:55.440
[Guest]: called it a growth recession, you know, a few smart people on Twitter commented, how

00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:00.640
[Guest]: can the words growth and recession be used one after the other, obviously, they do not

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:05.960
[Guest]: understand that, you know, economists have terms for various situations. This is a jargon

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:10.640
[Guest]: which Rajan was using. And growth recession is essentially a situation where economic

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.760
[Guest]: growth is slow. But the economy is in contracting, to be called a technical recession.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:20.200
[Guest]: So basically, your growth is in recession in the sense what was growing at 7% that became

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.320
[Guest]: 5, became 3, that's in the growth rate is in recession.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:30.880
[Guest]: At the same time, the unemployment is going up. So anyway, so we are in a growth, you

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:37.360
[Guest]: can call it a growth recession. I think Arvind Subramanian has called it a growth slowdown

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.800
[Guest]: or something like that, you know, we can keep arguing on the name, but that's not important.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:48.160
[Guest]: Now, you know, even in India, you know, our ministers or policymakers, government, journalists,

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:55.120
[Guest]: television channels, have all tried to talk up the economy. Now, I think my, the statement

00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:01.400
[Guest]: which obviously became most famous was the one that Nirmala Sitharaman, wherein she said,

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:06.240
[Guest]: the finance minister, she said that, you know, car sales have fallen because millennials

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:12.680
[Guest]: are buying Uber and Ola. I think for a finance minister of a country as big as India is to

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:18.560
[Guest]: make such a juvenile statement was sad. And this is like, you know, the government has

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:24.060
[Guest]: access to, you know, so many people in the Indian Economic Service, it has access to

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:29.560
[Guest]: so many think tanks. If such a statement was to be made, you know, there had to be some

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:36.400
[Guest]: research evidence backing it up. Okay. Also, it's like, you know, millennials have been

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:40.480
[Guest]: around, the poor guys keep getting blamed for everything, but they have been around

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:45.400
[Guest]: for a while now, right? And so have Uber and Ola. So it's not like millennials were not

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:52.640
[Guest]: there in 2014, 15, 16, 17 and 18. And Uber and Ola was also there. So why was it that

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:59.600
[Guest]: millennials stopped buying cars because of Uber and Ola only in 2019? Right? I mean,

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:04.400
[Guest]: so there are basic logical holes in what the minister said.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.320
[Amit Varma]: In fact, as a tangent, you know, Vivek, I think we have to confess that even people

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:15.280
[Amit Varma]: in our 40s, like we have kind of given millennials too much of a bad rap, as we are finding out

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:19.920
[Amit Varma]: over the last few days with these spirited protests across the country being led by millennials

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:24.880
[Amit Varma]: fighting for our idea of India. You know, there's actually a lot more reason to have

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.000
[Guest]: hope from this generation than there is.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.560
[Guest]: No, I mean, so I always, I've always said this, that the next generation is smarter.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:36.680
[Guest]: And I mean, given that I keep talking to students all the while, I think there is nothing wrong

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.320
[Guest]: with them. I mean, this is I mean, they may have a different attitude towards life.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.040
[Guest]: They are smarter because they invite you to gift talks.

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.720
[Guest]: No, I mean, so it's not, it's not like that. So I mean, so you can see you can make out

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:50.640
[Guest]: the smartness of a group by the kind of questions they ask you, right? And so everywhere I go,

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:55.920
[Guest]: and I mean, I talk to millennials, I think there's nothing, I mean, wrong with them.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.840
[Guest]: I mean, they may have a different approach to life, they may have a different approach

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:06.720
[Guest]: to learning, like one of the beautiful things that I sort of learnt at the IIM in Vishakhapatnam

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:11.200
[Guest]: recently, where I had gone to talk, where the professor just said he's Vivek Kaul.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.440
[Guest]: And he said, I won't introduce you because these guys have already googled you and they've

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:18.720
[Guest]: seen your YouTube videos. And, and I was like, yeah, I mean, this is how this generation

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:24.560
[Guest]: operates. And otherwise, what would have happened is in any other scenario, he would have introduced

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:28.600
[Guest]: me for five, seven minutes, and then I would have had to crack a joke. And, and we lost

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:33.480
[Guest]: the first 10 minutes of the class here, within the first minute, I was talking what I had

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:38.880
[Guest]: gone there for. So they had done their homework, it was just done in a different way, wherein,

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:43.240
[Guest]: you know, in our generation would have probably dug up, read a book or whatever these guys

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:49.440
[Guest]: are, you know, they have their ways. So, so getting back to what we were talking about,

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:54.000
[Guest]: so other than Nirmala Sitharaman, the other, you know, the statement that was made was

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:01.080
[Guest]: by Ravi Shankar Prasad. And he said that on 2nd October, people spend 120 crores watching

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:11.760
[Guest]: three movies, Joker, War, and Saira, Narasimha Reddy, Chiranjeevi's big release. And he said,

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:16.760
[Guest]: so where is the slowdown? Okay. Now, you know, in a country like India, whipping up a big

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:23.000
[Guest]: number is never really a, you know, it's not, it's not a problem at all. But you also have

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:30.200
[Guest]: to see where that big number fits into the overall scheme of things. So if you look at

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:37.040
[Guest]: the projected GDP of India during for 2019-20, I mean, this is the GDP, which is on which

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.800
[Guest]: all the calculations have happened in the budget, which was presented in February last

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:47.040
[Guest]: February this year, not last year, we are not yet into 2020. So the GDP forecast is

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:54.960
[Guest]: around 211 lakh crore, okay. Private consumption is around 58-59% of the GDP. So at 59%, I

00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:02.760
[Guest]: think it works out to around at 125 lakh crore, okay. So if you divide that 125 lakh crore

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:10.760
[Guest]: by 365 days, so the average consumption expenditure on any given day in India is around

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:18.160
[Guest]: 34,250 crore, which obviously will be a little higher on a day like October 2, because it's

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:24.600
[Guest]: a holiday, long weekend, and people go out and spend on these opportunities. So now imagine

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:35.760
[Guest]: 120 crore as a part of 34,250 crore, which Indians anyway, spend on a given day. So the

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:45.000
[Guest]: percentage is around 0.35%. So, you know, you have to look at the broader context before

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.560
[Guest]: you go out and say things. And the funny part was, he later said that I have withdrawn my

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.640
[Guest]: statement. Now, how do you this is something I've never understood. How do you withdraw

00:49:54.640 --> 00:50:00.280
[Guest]: something you have already said, you can either say, I stand by my statement, or you can say

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.320
[Amit Varma]: I was wrong. How do you withdraw it?

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.400
[Guest]: Because if reality changes, suddenly, you never said it to begin with, I can, you know,

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.080
[Guest]: I can understand once you've said it, and you realize it's okay. I mean, we all say

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:16.120
[Guest]: things which we regret. I mean, all that what that requires is, all you have to say I was

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:21.680
[Guest]: wrong. That's it. I mean, how do you withdraw that you can't withdraw that, right? So, and

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.840
[Guest]: so then, you know, so there are these points which keep getting made, wherein someone picks

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:30.960
[Guest]: up a part of the whole, and then throws that number at you and then asks you this question,

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:37.080
[Guest]: where is the slowdown? So, the other example that I love giving is on cars. And there are

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:43.440
[Guest]: these two cars, car companies, I should say, which are doing very well this year. One is

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:50.480
[Guest]: the Korean company Kia Motors, and then I think the other is MG Hector. So, these cars,

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.480
[Guest]: companies have sold a few 1000 cars. And every time you say there is a slowdown, they say,

00:50:54.480 --> 00:51:00.920
[Guest]: but what about Kia Motors? So, I did a very rough calculation. And so,

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:09.160
[Guest]: I'll sort of read out these numbers. Kia Motors has sold 40,845 units this year. By this year,

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:16.920
[Guest]: I mean April to November. MG Hector has sold 11,401 units. This is between April and November.

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:24.640
[Guest]: In total, 11.49 lakh cars have been sold this year. So, Kia Motors and MG Hector form only

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:32.560
[Guest]: 4.5% of the total cars sold. The total car sales during the same period in 2018, stood

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:40.520
[Guest]: at 15.35 lakh. So, from 15.35 lakh, we have fallen to 11.49 lakh, which is a drop of 25%.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:47.360
[Guest]: So, so clearly, there is a, you know, I mean, you can always take one data point and you

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:51.680
[Guest]: can cherry pick and yeah, and see, it's like the example I give these days is let's say

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:57.720
[Guest]: India grows at 10%. I mean, let's say, I'm assuming here. Now, obviously, there will

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:06.080
[Guest]: be parts of India, like let's say, Karnataka. Karnataka may grow at 15%. But Bihar might

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:12.520
[Guest]: go at 4%. So, that does not mean that there is no problem in just because India and Karnataka

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:16.640
[Guest]: are growing at a higher rate does not mean there's no problem in Bihar, right?

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:19.600
[Amit Varma]: And in this case, just because a small part of the whole is doing well doesn't mean the

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:23.520
[Guest]: whole is doing well. So, this is like the other way around. So, yeah, I mean, so there

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.280
[Guest]: are a lot of these things, which are sort of, you know, where people throw numbers at

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:32.840
[Guest]: us, without, you know, really giving us the context. But you know, the interesting thing

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:37.640
[Amit Varma]: here is that their target audience doesn't want the context, of course, they want the

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:42.000
[Amit Varma]: impressive number they are learning through WhatsApp University, they want the impressive

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.640
[Amit Varma]: number by which they can feel that they have a good argument to defend whatever side of

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:51.480
[Amit Varma]: the argument they're on. You know, this is not a failing, restricted to one wing or the

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:55.920
[Amit Varma]: other. And big numbers, like you said, sort of sound good, you know, speaking of big numbers,

00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:00.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, another sort of big number I came across recently was when I was on our favourite

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.560
[Amit Varma]: app, TikTok. Am I correct in saying it is our favourite app?

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.880
[Unknown]: Yeah, of course. I love TikTok.

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:10.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so TikTok. So, I was on TikTok. And I had, of course, introduced our good friend

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:15.320
[Amit Varma]: Mohit Satyanand and his wife Premi to TikTok. So, I saw a statistic I thought would interest

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:19.840
[Amit Varma]: them, which was that there were literally hundreds of videos on onions, which were parodying

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:24.920
[Amit Varma]: the government. I mean, TikTok was a centre of dissent in India. And the total number

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:31.560
[Amit Varma]: of views for these videos was some 360 million. So, I instantly took a screenshot and I send

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:36.240
[Amit Varma]: it to Mohit and Mohit was amazed. He was like, Oh, my God, this means like one view for everyone

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:40.520
[Amit Varma]: in every four Indians. And this is mind blowing. And this is amazing. And then I scroll down

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:45.920
[Amit Varma]: and there is another hashtag, some backbenchers hashtag or whatever, which had 6.4 billion

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:50.240
[Amit Varma]: views. I don't know how that is even possible given our population.

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:56.520
[Guest]: So, that's the whole thing. So, if you go on to YouTube now, you'll realise that a lot

00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:04.000
[Guest]: of songs in different Indian languages, not Hindi, okay, have huge number of hits. So,

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.080
[Guest]: there are Punjabi songs, I think there's one Punjabi song, which I don't recall the name

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:13.360
[Guest]: right now, which has close to a billion, which I mean, obviously, a lot of people watch them

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:19.360
[Guest]: again and again. What is also happening here is that because YouTube pays you, you know,

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:23.560
[Guest]: the business model is such that the more hits you have, the more money you make. I'm sure

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:27.960
[Guest]: there are bots or something which are going on. There was this controversy also recently

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:34.800
[Guest]: with Badshah on YouTube, wherein YouTube, I think refused to pay him because I mean,

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:38.280
[Guest]: you probably thought that there are bots which are driving up. No, the thing is, they have

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:42.280
[Amit Varma]: software to detect bots. But there was this interesting viral video, which, you know,

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:47.840
[Amit Varma]: was doing the rounds a few months ago, we showed this Chinese sort of clicking factory

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:52.120
[Amit Varma]: link clicking factory, where they just had, you know, 10s, if not hundreds of phones just

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:55.960
[Amit Varma]: lined up on the wall and a guy going from one to the other just clicking like on each

00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:00.040
[Amit Varma]: of them like physically, so it's not a bot doing it. So, even if you have some bot detection

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:04.800
[Amit Varma]: software, this is a guy physically or not. Yes, cumbersome, but you know, the Chinese

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:08.360
[Amit Varma]: will do anything. And hey, guess what, the Indians won't even though we have cheaper

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:14.320
[Amit Varma]: labour, that's, you know, it's a business model we should be getting in. But where is

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:21.200
[Amit Varma]: our informal sector anymore? Let's now take a quick commercial break. And we'll come back

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:29.160
[Amit Varma]: shortly to actually talk about 2019. One of the great joys of doing the seen and the unseen

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:34.400
[Amit Varma]: is that it forces me to read a lot more than I used to. I was a voracious reader as a kid.

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:39.240
[Amit Varma]: But once I entered adulthood, I lost that habit. And it's an incredibly important habit.

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:43.600
[Amit Varma]: The more we read, the better we understand the world and the people around us. We make

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:49.400
[Amit Varma]: sense of the world through stories by connecting dots. And the more dots we have, the clearer

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:53.960
[Amit Varma]: our vision. Reading gives us those dots. I've been working hard in my reading habit. And

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:59.880
[Amit Varma]: now I invite you to join me. My new podcast, The Book Club by Amit Verma begins in early

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:05.560
[Amit Varma]: January exclusively on Storytel. This is a weekly show that I run for a year. Every week

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:10.360
[Amit Varma]: on The Book Club, I will recommend one book that I enjoy reading. And I will speak about

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:15.560
[Amit Varma]: what it brought to me and why you should read it. You can use my show to take random recommendations

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:20.760
[Amit Varma]: yourself or you can start a reading club of your own using my show as a starting point.

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:25.920
[Amit Varma]: I'll discuss all genres of fiction and nonfiction. And hopefully together, we can understand

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:33.440
[Amit Varma]: the world a little bit better. Coming soon, The Book Club by Amit Verma, only on Storytel.

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.080
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with my good friend, Vivek Kaul,

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:44.120
[Amit Varma]: the Shah Rukh Khan of economics, the doomsayer of Twitter, about, you know, economics in

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:49.320
[Amit Varma]: India in 2019. And you know, one of the things I learned as a cricket journalist, because

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.640
[Amit Varma]: I started at Wisden and then Cricinfo and so on, is that look, everybody's watching

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:58.980
[Amit Varma]: the match and the basic commodity of the information, the news, what has happened, people know.

00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:03.440
[Amit Varma]: So when you're writing about the match the next day, for example, you should have a lot

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:07.800
[Amit Varma]: of analysis and go deeper and have more color and all that because the bare facts everybody

00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:11.280
[Amit Varma]: knows. But the thing is, you know, with the economy, I'm not sure if we even know the

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:15.760
[Amit Varma]: bare facts, because it is such a complex subject, and there is so much rhetoric around. So I'm

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:21.240
[Amit Varma]: actually going to ask you for the bare facts. How did our economy actually do in 2019? How

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.560
[Amit Varma]: does one sum it up? What is your match report?

00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:30.960
[Guest]: I think this has been the worst year in many years. I think by far the worst year since

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:37.280
[Guest]: I would say 2004, 2005, or even before that. So basically, you know, what has happened

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:43.240
[Guest]: is that, I mean, as I've said before, the private consumption expenditure is by far

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:50.920
[Guest]: the biggest part of the Indian economy. And it constitutes around 58-59%. And the growth

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:59.320
[Guest]: in private consumption expenditure peaked way back in 2011-12, okay, you know, at 17.5%.

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:05.620
[Guest]: And after that, the private consumption expenditure growth has largely seen a downward trend.

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:11.400
[Guest]: But it has always managed to grow in double digits. And this has basically ensured that

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.640
[Guest]: India has continued to grow.

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:17.440
[Amit Varma]: And by private consumption, just to clarify, what you mean is people like you and me spending

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.440
[Guest]: money.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.440
[Guest]: Spending something.

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.440
[Guest]: Movies.

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.440
[Guest]: Popcorn.

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.440
[Guest]: Pictures.

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:23.440
[Guest]: Cars.

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.440
[Guest]: Correct.

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:31.440
[Guest]: This is all private consumption. Now, in 2019-20, for the first time since 2004-05, the private

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:37.000
[Guest]: consumption growth has fallen into single digits, and it's been around close to 7%.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:43.160
[Guest]: I mean, nominal 7, not adjusted for inflation. So, the question is, why has this happened?

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:44.160
[Guest]: Okay.

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:49.120
[Guest]: The answer for this lies in the fact that our household savings and our net household

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:54.720
[Guest]: financial savings have been falling in the last few years. Now, what do I mean by this?

00:58:54.720 --> 00:59:00.320
[Guest]: The net household financial savings are essentially, you know, fixed deposits, insurance, mutual

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:08.000
[Guest]: funds, small savings, etc., minus the liabilities that people have sort of accumulated over

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000
[Guest]: the years.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:15.800
[Guest]: So, the household financial savings peaked between 2008-09 and 2010-11, when they were

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:21.960
[Guest]: greater than 10% of the national disposable income in each of the three years. Okay. After

00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:29.080
[Guest]: that, they have been falling and in 17-18, they reached a low of 6.5%.

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:34.120
[Guest]: And this has primarily happened because financial liabilities of people have been growing, which

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:38.440
[Guest]: basically means people have been borrowing more. Now, what does this tell us? It tells

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:45.040
[Guest]: us that the consumption growth, since it's peaked in 11-12, has been financed more and

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:51.280
[Guest]: more by people borrowing more. Okay. So, the borrowings have essentially continued to finance

00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:58.120
[Guest]: our consumption in the last 7-8 years. And that story is now unravelling.

00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.880
[Guest]: Now, other than looking at the…

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:04.000
[Amit Varma]: By borrowing, do you, newbie question, do you include things like credit card?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.360
[Guest]: Anything, you know, personal loans, so on, I mean, NBFC loans. And now, if you look at

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:15.280
[Guest]: overall household savings, they have also been falling over the years. Now, what that

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:21.560
[Guest]: tells you is that other than borrowing, a greater proportion of the income is being

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:31.480
[Guest]: spent towards consumption. So, which again explains why people are saving less and using

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:40.560
[Guest]: that money to consume more. Now, the question again is why are savings falling? Okay. And

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:47.240
[Guest]: the answer for that lies in the fact that our income growth has also slowed down in

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:54.560
[Guest]: the last few years. In fact, the per capita income growth peaked way back in 2010-11 at

01:00:54.560 --> 01:01:03.120
[Guest]: 16.9%. And I think since 2014-15, the growth rate of income has been in single digits.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.600
[Guest]: Okay. And if you look at the income tax data, it tells you that between assessment year

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:15.760
[Guest]: 12-13 and assessment year 18-19, salaried income has grown at just 4.5% per year. So,

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.360
[Guest]: what that tells you is that if you adjust for inflation, the salaried income has actually

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:29.240
[Guest]: come down. Rural wages for men, you know, sort of grew at 28% in 13-14. Since then,

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:34.360
[Guest]: they have grown in single digits, with the growth in 18-19 falling to just 3.8%.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:39.320
[Guest]: Wow. And this is again nominal terms. If you take an inflation, it's gone down.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:44.480
[Guest]: And all nominal. The same is true for the rural wages for women. So, basically, because

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:50.560
[Guest]: the income growth has slowed down, people have used a greater proportion of their income

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:57.080
[Guest]: to consume, because of which their savings have come down, and they have also borrowed

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:04.880
[Guest]: to consume more. Right. So, all this was essentially financing Indian consumption since the consumption

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.760
[Amit Varma]: growth peaked in 11-12.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.760
[Amit Varma]: And do these falling savings then have an impact down the line on investments?

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:18.480
[Guest]: No. So, which is what I mean, I was coming to. So, basically, now, the question is, why

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:24.320
[Guest]: has the income not been growing? The income has not been growing primarily because if

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:30.120
[Guest]: you look at the investment to GDP ratio, that also has been falling over the years. So,

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:36.760
[Guest]: the investment to GDP ratio peaked in 2007-8 at 35.8%. And in the last few years, it's

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:43.240
[Guest]: varied between 28 and 29%. Now, just to give you a few data points, which essentially show

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:50.520
[Guest]: you how bad the situation is. In 2010-11, the new investment projects announced were

01:02:50.520 --> 01:03:00.720
[Guest]: worth 25.7 lakh crore. In 18-19, this was down to 12.1 lakh crore or 46% of the earlier

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:07.720
[Guest]: year. During the first six months of 19-20, new investment projects worth just 2.04 lakh

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:12.960
[Guest]: crore have been announced. So, this tells you how bad the situation is on the investment

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:18.200
[Guest]: front. Now, this is a scarier number because announcements are okay. I mean, people announce

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:24.480
[Guest]: all kinds of things. When it comes to investment projects drop, the situation appears to be

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:30.440
[Guest]: even more grim. In 10-11, the investment projects worth 4.04 lakh crore had been dropped. This

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:37.880
[Guest]: jumped to 20.74 lakh crore in 18-19. During the first six months of 19-20, projects worth

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:45.560
[Guest]: rupees 7.9 lakh crore have already been dropped. So, basically, what has happened is that investments

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:51.800
[Guest]: haven't sort of grown at the rate they were expected to, because of which there has been

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:57.800
[Guest]: an impact on income growth, because of which there has been, you know, people have consumed

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:03.000
[Guest]: a greater part of their income, and they've also consumed by borrowing more, and because

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.640
[Guest]: of which our consumption growth sort of, you know, which should have slowed down dramatically

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:16.720
[Guest]: earlier did not slow down. And all this is now sort of coming together. Now, the problem

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.720
[Guest]: is you might ask that, you know, why are you saying this now and not in 2018? The problem

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.380
[Guest]: is that a lot of data in India is not available quickly enough. So, if you look at the financial

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:32.280
[Guest]: savings data numbers that I'm offering now, were not available back then. So, the numbers

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:39.880
[Guest]: were available only as of 15-16, and then 16-17. And the trend was not very obvious.

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:46.800
[Guest]: But once the 17-18 data came in, the trend became very, very obvious. So, basically,

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:52.960
[Guest]: you know, as our current chief economic advisor keeps saying, investment ultimately finances

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:59.840
[Guest]: consumption. Consumption can only finance consumption up to a certain extent, because

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.440
[Guest]: it is investment, which creates economic activity.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:06.480
[Amit Varma]: In fact, that's the central point of the episode I did with Mohit Sityanand in August, which

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.480
[Amit Varma]: will be linked from the show notes.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:11.960
[Guest]: So, one example I sort of, so in every city I speak, I mean, at least the bigger cities,

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:16.960
[Guest]: I give the example of that city. So, I was recently in Bangalore, and the example I gave

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:23.120
[Guest]: in Bangalore was of the IT industry in Bangalore, right? Now, when the first set of companies

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:28.160
[Guest]: came in, and they said, okay, let's establish something in Bangalore. So, Bangalore was

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:33.520
[Guest]: a sleepy pensioner's town three decades back, and now it's, you know, it's a global IT hub.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.080
[Guest]: So, when the first set of companies came in, and they established, you know, their code

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:43.660
[Guest]: writing center or whatever, they hired people. Now, those people who were hired had to then

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:48.680
[Guest]: go look for housing, okay, right? And once they sort of, you know, rented their homes

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:54.600
[Guest]: or whatever, they had to furnish that home, right? Then they had to hire cooks, so on

01:05:54.600 --> 01:06:01.720
[Guest]: and so forth, maids. And that's how the, you know, economic activity sort of created other

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:02.720
[Amit Varma]: economic activity.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.040
[Guest]: Because the cooks will get a place to stay, they'll have some kind of furniture, they

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.040
[Guest]: will travel around.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:10.920
[Guest]: So, if you look at, so, you know, many years back, I was at the Indian School of Business

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:15.880
[Guest]: in Hyderabad, and one researcher offered this very interesting data point. And he said,

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:23.360
[Guest]: every formal job in Bangalore creates six informal jobs around it. And, you know, to

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:26.680
[Guest]: the extent, I mean, look at the real estate boom in that city, I mean, it would have never

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:31.600
[Guest]: happened, right? I mean, and when a real estate boom happens, the kind of employment that

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:38.920
[Guest]: is created, especially for, you know, people who do not have specialized skills is mind

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:44.440
[Guest]: boggling, right? So, a similar thing has happened in Hyderabad, a similar thing has happened

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:51.000
[Guest]: in Pune, where economic activity has feeded on economic activity, which is already happening.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.120
[Guest]: And at the heart of it is, I mean, you can call it investment, you can call it anything.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:03.520
[Guest]: Basically, someone needs to start a business and employ people to run that business. So,

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:11.440
[Guest]: unless that happens, it's very difficult for consumption to continue to be robust. And

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:17.560
[Guest]: it is very difficult without consumption. If consumption is not robust, the economy

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.680
[Amit Varma]: cannot continue to grow at the same pace.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:24.280
[Amit Varma]: And the thing to notice is starting a business is not a blind shot in the dark, someone deciding

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:28.200
[Amit Varma]: to do something for society by starting a business. There are incentives in play, he

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.600
[Amit Varma]: has a sense of the market, how much money people are willing to play. What you've just

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.120
[Amit Varma]: described is a virtuous cycle, that you have investment happening, it creates jobs and

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:41.880
[Amit Varma]: opportunities for many people who all consume and that consumption then makes industry prosper

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.600
[Amit Varma]: and they spend more and then therefore people are more to consume. And it's a virtuous cycle.

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:50.360
[Amit Varma]: What we are in now, as you also described eloquently before, this is a vicious cycle,

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:55.080
[Amit Varma]: where people are consuming less and less. And therefore, industry is growing worse and

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.800
[Amit Varma]: worse, and they are spending less and less. So, people are consuming less and less because

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:02.920
[Amit Varma]: they have less and less money. Now, the thing is, how did we get from that virtuous cycle

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:08.880
[Amit Varma]: to a vicious cycle? And what can be done to like, how does one get back out of this? What

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:13.160
[Amit Varma]: are the typical sort of things that you'd look at doing? I mean, I understand part of

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:21.280
[Amit Varma]: the problem is just diagnosing the situation properly, which hasn't really happened to

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:26.000
[Amit Varma]: that extent. And, you know, even within that there are so many fumblings. But how does

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
[Guest]: one move from one kind of cycle to another? I think I'll answer that. I think before that,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.440
[Guest]: the other thing I wanted to sort of elaborate on was India's demographic dividend. Okay.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:40.600
[Guest]: I think it's very, very important to talk about this. So, you know, the first time I

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:48.440
[Guest]: sort of encountered this term was sometime in 2006, 2007, when I used to be a journalist

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:54.000
[Guest]: covering personal finance for this newspaper called Daily News and Analysis, which shut

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.520
[Guest]: down sometime back. And I used to have to cover these new mutual fund, equity mutual

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.800
[Guest]: fund schemes being launched. Now, obviously, there was no difference between once, you

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:09.400
[Guest]: know, all the schemes were the same, you know, they'd probably go and buy stocks and make

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.960
[Guest]: money for the investors, hope to at least. So, all these press conferences used to have

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.680
[Guest]: a presentation made by a fund manager. And all the fund managers used to have what I

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:25.400
[Guest]: started calling the IDD slide, which is basically India's demographic dividend. Now, demographic

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:32.040
[Guest]: dividend is essentially a period of few decades in the, you know, in the life cycle of a country

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:39.340
[Guest]: where the workforce increases at a faster rate than the overall population. And this

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:44.520
[Guest]: happens primarily because the infant mortality rate over the years, which is basically the

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:52.480
[Guest]: number of babies who die before the age of one comes down dramatically. Now, as these

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:58.920
[Guest]: people enter the workforce and find jobs and you know, make money and spend that money,

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:03.960
[Guest]: the economy grows at a faster pace because of that millions of people get pulled out

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:09.800
[Guest]: of poverty. And it's happened in all the countries which have gone from being developing to becoming

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:15.600
[Guest]: developed countries have had, you know, demographic dividend play a role in it. Now, in India's

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:21.960
[Guest]: case, we were told back in 2006-7, that a million Indians were entering the workforce

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:29.560
[Guest]: every month, okay, which is around 1.2 crore a year. And this is when our female labor

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:36.300
[Guest]: participation rate is low. You know, if a majority of the women start entering the workforce,

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:41.200
[Guest]: this number could go up to at least 2 million a month, not 2 million a month, but around

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:48.080
[Guest]: 1.8, 1.9 million a month easily. So, now, so obviously, you know, there had to be, you

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:54.360
[Guest]: know, jobs had to be created for these people. But given the fact that, you know, investment

01:10:54.360 --> 01:11:00.560
[Guest]: isn't really happening, the kind of jobs that had to be created for these people haven't

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:06.120
[Guest]: been created. And because of that, you know, now you have all this unemployment data coming

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:13.840
[Guest]: out, which is very, very scary. So, you know, you had the National Sample Survey's offices,

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:18.400
[Guest]: periodic labor force survey, and according to which the rate of unemployment among 15

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:27.720
[Guest]: to 29 year olds was at 17.4% in 17-18, having jumped from 5% in 11-12. Now, the Center for

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:34.080
[Guest]: Monitoring Indian Economy puts out more recent data, and they say that the rate of unemployment

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:42.480
[Guest]: in January 2017, among 15 to 29 year olds, 20 to 24 year olds, and 25 to 29 year olds

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:54.840
[Guest]: was 27.3%, 21.6%, and 8.7%. In November 2019, the rate was at 40.9%, 39.2%, and 10%. So,

01:11:54.840 --> 01:12:02.120
[Guest]: there has been a huge jump. At the same time, the labor force participation rate has fallen.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:09.080
[Guest]: So what that basically means is that a lot of people who could not find jobs have opted

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:14.920
[Guest]: out of the labor force. And even then, the rate of unemployment has gone up. I think

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:23.640
[Guest]: Dr. Ratan Roy, who is the boss man at NIPFP, if I remember correctly, made a very interesting

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:30.200
[Guest]: point in a recent interview. And I think this all of us should have this data point in our

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:35.800
[Guest]: heads. And this is coming from Dr. Roy, I mean, who's, you know, as nonpartisan as one

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:42.720
[Guest]: can get. Not from Dr. Debra Roy. I mean, we need to differentiate between our Roys and

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.720
[Amit Varma]: our Debra Roys.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:48.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, between the economists who still have some integrity and those who don't, if I may

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.440
[Guest]: put it plainly.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:55.240
[Guest]: The number of young Indians without jobs, but also not looking for jobs. And additionally,

01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:01.040
[Guest]: not in any institute for training or education has almost tripled in the last 10 years. It

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:08.480
[Guest]: was estimated to be at 3, 3.5 crore a decade ago. It's now believed to be 10 crore or more.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.960
[Guest]: So if you remove the retired and those too young to work, this 10 crore constitutes a

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.160
[Guest]: very sizable section of the population of our workforce.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:21.920
[Guest]: Now, you know, one thing that has happened because of this is, you know, if you look

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:28.520
[Guest]: at all the, or not all the, but large section of landowning castes in India, wanting reservations

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:33.640
[Guest]: in government jobs, this is a clear impact of that, okay, where our demographic dividend

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.640
[Amit Varma]: is not working.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:37.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is, in fact, a dual problem, because the thing is that, for example, the

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.960
[Amit Varma]: Jat agitation, the Faryana, the Maratha agitations here and different agitations and different,

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:46.360
[Amit Varma]: the Partidar agitations of Gujarat, I have had occasion to refer to them in multiple

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:51.040
[Amit Varma]: episodes on multiple subjects, because they also reference, for example, a problem with

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:56.280
[Amit Varma]: agriculture, because, because people in agriculture are effectively trapped in agriculture.

01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:02.000
[Amit Varma]: What really happens is that with every passing generation, the amount of land holding within

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
[Amit Varma]: a family keeps going down.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.920
[Amit Varma]: Because if you have two kids, your land is halved, if you have three, it is one third

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.920
[Amit Varma]: and so on down the generations.

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:15.200
[Amit Varma]: And why you have so many landowning castes across the country, Jats, Partidars, Marathas,

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:19.960
[Amit Varma]: agitating for reservations in these numbers is because agriculture is simply not a way

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.820
[Amit Varma]: for them to make a living and they need an exit.

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:28.480
[Amit Varma]: And because our sort of industrial policies and our policies regarding land and labor

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:34.520
[Amit Varma]: still haven't been modernized, unfortunately, the sort of generation of jobs that should

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:39.760
[Amit Varma]: have led to this demographic explosion actually being a dividend simply hasn't happened.

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.820
[Amit Varma]: I mean, when we talk about you have 1 million people coming into the workforce every month,

01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:46.040
[Amit Varma]: and therefore you need to provide jobs for them.

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.440
[Amit Varma]: Provide jobs is the loose way of putting it.

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.280
[Amit Varma]: The point is, it's no one's job to provide jobs, you know, a government is not going

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:56.920
[Amit Varma]: to provide jobs, it can only create the conditions in which the natural creativity and entrepreneurship

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.200
[Amit Varma]: of people can thrive.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.960
[Amit Varma]: And then those industries will happen, those jobs will happen.

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.480
[Amit Varma]: The truth is that those conditions have never for the most part existed.

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:11.120
[Amit Varma]: Yes, you know, the 91 reforms did help a little bit in terms of liberalizing product markets,

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.880
[Amit Varma]: but not factor markets, not land, labor, and so on.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:19.600
[Amit Varma]: And we are feeling the effect of those fundamental structural reforms not being made because

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:24.000
[Amit Varma]: month after month, every month, more than 10 lakh people come into the workforce, and

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.480
[Amit Varma]: the jobs aren't there.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.480
[Guest]: Right.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.920
[Guest]: So the other impact of this now which is happening, and I think this is the next big dangerous

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:36.320
[Guest]: thing is state governments wanting to reserve jobs for locals.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:42.800
[Guest]: So it's already, Andhra Pradesh has done it, the Maharashtra's new three party government

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.680
[Guest]: in Mumbai is talking about it.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:50.960
[Guest]: Now, I think this is basically a race to the bottom and puts the entire idea of India at

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:51.960
[Guest]: stake.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:57.760
[Guest]: You know, if we cannot even move around in the country to get a job, then you know, where

01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.640
[Guest]: does that leave us?

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:06.520
[Guest]: Also, you know, this is also gets us into the touchy subject of migration, right?

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:12.080
[Guest]: Because within a country, people are bound to move from parts which have less economic

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:15.320
[Guest]: activity to parts which have more economic activity.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:21.800
[Guest]: And migration is by far the quickest way of reducing inequality, okay.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:26.280
[Guest]: So if that is not allowed to happen, and you know, it's it's a very tricky situation.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.120
[Guest]: Now look at Andhra Pradesh, it's a new state, right?

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:32.440
[Guest]: I mean, and it needs a lot of investment.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.960
[Guest]: So how do you get that investment?

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:37.320
[Guest]: I mean, companies come and establish factories and offices there.

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:42.960
[Guest]: Now, would you expect a private company to go to a state which insists on hiring local

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:43.960
[Guest]: labor?

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:48.160
[Guest]: Or would a company go to a state which lets you know, hire the best people available for

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.160
[Guest]: the job, right?

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:54.040
[Guest]: Now, so the point I was trying to make, you know, I think I said this somewhere in I think

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:59.360
[Guest]: in Bangalore only where that, you know, imagine if in the late 70s and early 80s, the people

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:05.160
[Guest]: who ran the IT policy of Karnataka, even if there was anything like that, I would have

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:10.920
[Guest]: said that only Karnatikas have to be hired, right?

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.440
[Guest]: Or only people who are local to let's say, Karnataka, I mean, they may not be Karnatikas

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:18.360
[Guest]: because Bangalore is full of Tamilians, as well, and even Telugus.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:25.160
[Guest]: So would the IT companies have come to Bangalore and established as many, you know, companies

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:30.480
[Guest]: as they did, or even take the example that I remember here is when Indian School of Business

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:36.600
[Guest]: first came to India, or rather when the idea was mooted, it was supposed to be established

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:42.000
[Guest]: in Mumbai, what happened was that the Maharashtra government wanted 20% reservation or some

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.600
[Guest]: such number for the local population, which is an end Chandrababu, when I do saw this

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:52.920
[Guest]: as an opportunity, because Hyderabad had just started coming up at that point of time, and

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:57.920
[Guest]: ISB in Hyderabad would have been this trophy project, which would sort of attract a lot

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.280
[Guest]: of global attention, which it did.

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.960
[Guest]: And he just seized on to the opportunity and just, you know, and ISB ended up in Hyderabad.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:11.560
[Guest]: So my point is that, you know, how will it will be interesting to see how will companies

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.560
[Guest]: react to this?

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.520
[Guest]: Also, how will politicians react to this, because it's very easy for a politician to

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:21.920
[Guest]: just say, okay, we'll reserve jobs for locals, you know, that again, I mean, it brings us

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:25.400
[Guest]: back to how you know, what we were talking before we came to the studio to record this

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:33.600
[Guest]: episode as to how governments and politicians like to put out simplistic things, right?

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.280
[Guest]: So okay, there are jobs are a problem, okay, we'll not let migrants come in.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.240
[Guest]: But is that really the solution?

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:45.560
[Guest]: No, because ultimately, what you want is economic activity, right?

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:50.520
[Guest]: And when migrants come in, I mean, they do create economic activity, lots of it, in fact,

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:56.120
[Guest]: I mean, they spend money, they eat, they rent homes, they go out watch movies, in fact,

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:59.720
[Amit Varma]: Bombay, like all great cities in the world is a city built entirely by migrants.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:04.320
[Amit Varma]: And I've in fact, had I had a great episode with Chinmay Tumbe on his book, India moving,

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.000
[Amit Varma]: which, by the way, I think is a great book, one of the most underrated books of the year,

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.840
[Amit Varma]: which talks about just internal migration without India and its effects.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:16.680
[Amit Varma]: And I want to elaborate a bit on this question of simplistic narratives.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:20.040
[Amit Varma]: And then come back to you with a question after that, which is that, I mean, what has

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:24.000
[Amit Varma]: always been the case, but what we've seen more of over the last few years, as populism

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.200
[Amit Varma]: has grown, is that these simplistic narratives, finding a certain popular validation, for

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.880
[Amit Varma]: example, one of the things that distinguish Trump from say, Hillary Clinton, when he was

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:39.400
[Amit Varma]: standing against her in 2016, was his use of powerful, simple narratives to explain

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.880
[Amit Varma]: the problems of the world.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:44.980
[Amit Varma]: For example, he said that, why are there no jobs in middle America, two of the simplistic

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:49.360
[Amit Varma]: explanations he came up with, one, immigrants are coming and taking away your jobs.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.760
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, let's stop immigration, let's send the Mexicans back.

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:56.240
[Amit Varma]: And two, outsourcing is bad, your jobs are being shipped overseas.

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.280
[Amit Varma]: So you know, let's stop shipping jobs overseas.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:01.380
[Amit Varma]: Now, both of these explanations are completely wrong.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:06.320
[Amit Varma]: But both of these are very easy to understand and get behind in a rhetorical sense.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:10.360
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, you've pointed out how in our cities, people will often say, oh, there's a jobs

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.360
[Amit Varma]: problem.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.080
[Amit Varma]: It's migrants are coming and messing it up.

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:16.080
[Amit Varma]: They are also a problem in the culture and blah, blah, blah.

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.080
[Amit Varma]: Let's stop migrants.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.080
[Amit Varma]: Let's give jobs to locals.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:23.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, one simplistic narrative that I see coming up in the days to come, and Modi has

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:28.400
[Amit Varma]: alluded to it in his speeches, is the population problem, which is not really a problem in

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.400
[Amit Varma]: my view at all.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:36.280
[Amit Varma]: But because you know, there is a jobs crisis, I expect him to blame it on our growing population

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:40.760
[Amit Varma]: and propose population control measures such as only two kids per family, which will of

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:46.360
[Amit Varma]: course, which he expects to hit Muslims disproportionately, because that is a rhetoric that they have more

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:51.960
[Amit Varma]: kids than Hindus do, which is not exactly true, though it is true that the poor have

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:56.040
[Amit Varma]: more kids than the rich do, and the Muslims tend to be disproportionately poor.

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.280
[Amit Varma]: Leaving all of that aside, I mean,

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.840
[Guest]: No, I just like to cut in there.

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:04.680
[Guest]: And in fact, you know, this this population thing, and it really, it's such a huge thing

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.800
[Guest]: in the minds of people, but it's not really true anymore.

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:13.400
[Guest]: Because if you look at the births for women, it has come down to around 2.3, okay, the

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:21.040
[Guest]: replacement rate is 2.1 globally, which basically means that for every 100 women, 210 children

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:24.960
[Guest]: need to be born to for the population to be the same.

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:29.720
[Guest]: Now, in Indian case, because the infant mortality rate is higher, our 2.3 is almost equal to

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:30.720
[Guest]: 2.1.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:37.280
[Guest]: Now, so which basically means that our population will start stabilizing in a few decades.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.880
[Guest]: And we have done it the right way.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:43.400
[Guest]: We haven't done it the China way, wherein we have limited, you know, the number of kids.

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:48.400
[Guest]: And because of that, you know, China has this, you know, there are, you know, parents basically

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:49.400
[Guest]: want boys.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:54.640
[Amit Varma]: I left two responses to that, and one of them is a disagreement.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:58.960
[Amit Varma]: First response to that is even if it wasn't 2.3, if it was 2.8, or 2.9, or whatever, I

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.040
[Amit Varma]: don't care.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:04.880
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, one of the basic fallacies that people tend to hold about economics and

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:07.120
[Amit Varma]: society is that more people are a bad thing.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.200
[Amit Varma]: That is not the case.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:13.320
[Amit Varma]: People are what the economist Julian Simon called the ultimate resource.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.040
[Amit Varma]: People bring in more than they take out.

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:19.360
[Amit Varma]: I mean, a classic illustration of this is that look, all migration happens from rural

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:25.080
[Amit Varma]: areas to cities, from places which don't have so much population density to places of very

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.800
[Amit Varma]: high population density.

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:31.520
[Amit Varma]: The most prosperous parts of any country are its highly dense cities.

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Why do people migrate to them?

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.880
[Amit Varma]: Because more people means larger economic networks, more opportunities, better markets

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.960
[Amit Varma]: for whatever goods or services or talents that they might have.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:45.640
[Amit Varma]: And you can point to say, a Bangladesh or an India which are poor countries and say,

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.360
[Amit Varma]: look at the population density.

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:51.680
[Amit Varma]: But you can also point to a Bahrain or a Monaco which have a greater population density and

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.240
[Amit Varma]: are far more prosperous.

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:59.300
[Amit Varma]: So in that sense, population isn't a problem at all and of all people, our current generation

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.280
[Amit Varma]: of leaders who grew up during emergency should realize that.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:05.680
[Amit Varma]: My second point, which is a slight disagreement, is I don't think we've got here the right

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:06.680
[Amit Varma]: way.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:12.920
[Guest]: I think, you know, we keep talking about China, but, you know, we keep talking about, you

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:18.240
[Amit Varma]: know, Sanjay Gandhi's forced Nazbandis, which happens in the tens of thousands during emergency,

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:23.080
[Amit Varma]: but it's actually those practices continue to the present day with throughout the country,

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:28.480
[Amit Varma]: rural government doctors and health care centers are incentivized to do more and more Nazbandis

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:31.440
[Amit Varma]: and poor uneducated people fall prey to it.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:36.080
[Amit Varma]: And all the problems that we put on, you know, the door of population that this is happening

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:40.160
[Amit Varma]: because we have too many people is actually something that governance should be blamed

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.160
[Amit Varma]: for.

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:46.020
[Amit Varma]: All the failures of our governance are, you know, ascribed to population and I strongly

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:49.680
[Amit Varma]: suspect Prime Minister Modi will again do that to explain his failure of not enough

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:54.060
[Amit Varma]: jobs by attempting to say that there are too many people.

01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:56.480
[Amit Varma]: And we should give a response like that.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:00.560
[Amit Varma]: We should give an explanation like that the response it deserves if it does come about.

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:05.800
[Guest]: So going back to we were talking about simple and simplistic explanations.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:11.560
[Guest]: So obviously, Donald Trump has used it successfully, and so have, you know, our leaders in India.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:16.280
[Guest]: I mean, look at the explanation for why is there a slowdown in consumer demand?

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:18.240
[Guest]: It's because millionaires are not buying cars.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:23.200
[Guest]: Now, the explanation is much simpler to sell than say something like incomes have risen

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:27.720
[Guest]: at a slow pace, and hence people have not been spending money, or the fact that they

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.720
[Guest]: don't have much confidence in the economic future, or the fact that they have over borrowed

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:38.160
[Guest]: in the recent past, or the fact that India's so called demographic dividend is collapsing,

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.520
[Guest]: or the fact that investment in the Indian economy is collapsed.

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:48.960
[Guest]: I mean, these are all proper nuanced, sometimes difficult to understand arguments, right.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:55.000
[Guest]: And you know, in our daily lives, in our busy lives, we are basically looking for pointers.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.760
[Guest]: Now, everything in life cannot be a pointer.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:04.680
[Guest]: But that's why WhatsApp, I mean, we have more graduates graduating out of the University

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.680
[Guest]: of WhatsApp than proper universities.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:11.040
[Amit Varma]: So my sort of question for you, which was coming on from the simplistic thing is that

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:16.200
[Amit Varma]: simplistic narrative sell, like the nativism in our cities, or like farm loan waivers will

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:21.000
[Amit Varma]: solve the problem of agriculture, given that I think both of us would agree that a lot

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.280
[Amit Varma]: of good politics makes for bad economics.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.280
[Amit Varma]: What is the way out of this?

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:32.600
[Guest]: I mean, see, ultimately, you know, as a politician, as a leader, you need to be, how do I put

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.400
[Amit Varma]: it?

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:35.400
[Amit Varma]: Thinking of the longer term?

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:40.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you need to do the right thing, unless you I mean, I know, it's a tie to the election

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
[Guest]: cycle.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
[Guest]: No, you are in the next election.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
[Guest]: But then I mean, so, you know, I mean, it's not like reforms haven't happened in other

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.400
[Guest]: countries and people haven't won elections.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:56.080
[Guest]: So the problem in India is that no leader ever has tried to explain the utility of economic

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.720
[Guest]: reforms to people.

01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:02.840
[Guest]: We've always tried to push, you know, reform by stealth, you know, wherein we are in a

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:03.840
[Guest]: crisis.

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:04.840
[Guest]: And so we have to do this.

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:05.840
[Guest]: So no questions asked.

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.320
[Guest]: So we push this through.

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:10.600
[Guest]: So that sort of gives a bad name to economic reforms.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:15.480
[Guest]: But I mean, look at the fact that, you know, what happened in 1991, when the economy was

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:19.400
[Guest]: opened up, large parts of the economy were opened up for the private sector.

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:24.880
[Guest]: I mean, look at the kind of wealth and prosperity it has created, obviously more than 350 million

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:28.000
[Guest]: people brought out of poverty, obviously not for everyone.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.280
[Guest]: It has also led to, I mean, you I know, you don't agree that India has, I mean, inequality

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.400
[Amit Varma]: is not an issue in India, because poverty is an issue, I think, I mean, yes.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:42.480
[Guest]: So you know, it probably hasn't pulled enough people out of poverty and, but it has, you

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:44.920
[Guest]: know, done its fair share of things.

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:45.920
[Amit Varma]: Let me put it like this.

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:48.960
[Amit Varma]: I think it's pulled 350 million people out of poverty.

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:53.400
[Amit Varma]: And there is still a great task, which has moral significance, which is to pull the remaining

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.240
[Amit Varma]: people who are still in poverty out of poverty.

01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:59.960
[Amit Varma]: And that hasn't happened because we haven't reformed fast enough or gone far enough.

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:05.640
[Guest]: So someone has to sort of, you know, I mean, look at our Prime Minister, he gives so many

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:10.160
[Guest]: speeches, does so many election rallies, I mean, he's connected to the public.

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.680
[Guest]: I mean, it's a broadcast, yes.

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:17.960
[Guest]: But he's connected to the public probably more than any other leader in the recent past.

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:22.960
[Guest]: So I think the buck stops with him, because, you know, a finance minister can only be as

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:27.480
[Guest]: good as, as the Prime Minister is, I mean, as much support as he or she gets from the

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:28.760
[Guest]: Prime Minister.

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:35.080
[Guest]: Having said that, I mean, as I said, you know, we need to do a lot of things which governments

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:37.600
[Guest]: know about, all governments know about this.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:44.200
[Guest]: I mean, you have to bring in land and labour reforms, tax reforms, look at the fact that

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.560
[Guest]: education is a huge problem these days.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:51.040
[Guest]: I mean, so while there is unemployment, at the same time, when companies advertise for

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:55.680
[Guest]: jobs, they do not get people with adequate skill sets.

01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.640
[Guest]: Most of our engineers are unemployable.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:04.440
[Guest]: People who sort of go through the school system cannot read, write, do basic math properly.

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:08.160
[Amit Varma]: In fact, that's like you pointed out one of the great ironies, which we've addressed in

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:12.760
[Amit Varma]: every episode on education that I've done, for example, that there is this mismatch between

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:13.760
[Amit Varma]: demand and supply.

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.160
[Amit Varma]: There might be a jobs crisis, yes.

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:19.160
[Amit Varma]: But even for jobs that are available, there aren't enough skilled people and you have

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:26.360
[Amit Varma]: like 1000s of PhDs applying for jobs available for peon, which means that the market for

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:27.640
[Amit Varma]: education is failing.

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:31.960
[Amit Varma]: And what I again point out is that all the sectors which were privatised and allowed

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:36.560
[Amit Varma]: to, where the private sector was fully allowed to operate, like airlines or telephones or

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:40.200
[Amit Varma]: whatever, which I remember in the 80s were government monopolies.

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:44.160
[Amit Varma]: We have all thrived there, tremendous value has been created, everyone can, you know,

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.040
[Amit Varma]: many more people can afford that value.

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:50.840
[Amit Varma]: But in education, where there is still such a strong government control over the sector,

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:54.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, there's just been, you know, the outcomes are so...

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:58.720
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, in fact, you know, people who complain about call drops these days have

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:04.520
[Guest]: no idea as to how, you know, fixed line phones used to be dead for days at the end.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.080
[Guest]: Because you know, the lineman wouldn't have been bribed properly.

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.600
[Amit Varma]: No, and this goes back to the demographic dividend at one sign of the demographic dividend

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.880
[Amit Varma]: is that 60% of the country is born after 1991.

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:20.960
[Amit Varma]: But what this also means is that this 60% has no lived experience of what life was like

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.720
[Guest]: under those socialist days.

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:26.200
[Guest]: I mean, when you had only one TV channel, when you had one TV channel, which would operate

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:30.560
[Amit Varma]: only in the evenings, it would take you five years to get a telephone line, it would and

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:35.240
[Amit Varma]: that was actually a time where a used car was worth more than a brand new car.

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:38.080
[Amit Varma]: Because you could buy a used car immediately, you could buy a used car immediately, a brand

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.640
[Guest]: new car would take six years to come.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:44.440
[Guest]: So I remember, you know, our telephone connection in Ranchi, I think Papa first applied for

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.120
[Guest]: it in 1983.

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.240
[Guest]: We finally got it in 1992.

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.240
[Amit Varma]: There you go.

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.240
[Amit Varma]: Nine years.

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.240
[Guest]: Can you even imagine?

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.280
[Guest]: Now you can just get it in under nine minutes.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.280
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:58.680
[Guest]: So I mean, yeah, I mean, obviously, there are a lot of problems with the current system,

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:04.520
[Amit Varma]: but it is no comparison with what you have to unleash private enterprise, which simply

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:05.520
[Amit Varma]: hasn't happened.

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:09.480
[Amit Varma]: And for people who haven't, you know, read my columns on this before, I quickly want

01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:14.840
[Amit Varma]: to clarify the point Vivek was making about inequality and poverty that I think in India,

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:19.360
[Amit Varma]: our key problem is poverty, because the pie is not fixed.

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:24.260
[Amit Varma]: Inequality is not an issue we should worry about simply because as what happens in developing

01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:30.080
[Amit Varma]: countries like India, and the data shows this, is that as poverty goes down, inequality inevitably

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:31.080
[Amit Varma]: goes up.

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:34.080
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't mean the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer or staying

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.080
[Amit Varma]: poor.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:38.520
[Amit Varma]: Everybody is getting richer, except the rich are getting richer faster, which leads to

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:43.640
[Amit Varma]: increased inequality, but which also leads to people coming out of poverty.

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:49.080
[Amit Varma]: This is also, you know, people moving to cities is also an illustration of this because cities

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:52.000
[Amit Varma]: have far more inequality than towns do.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.440
[Amit Varma]: And yet people come there because that is a way to get out of poverty.

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:59.400
[Amit Varma]: So India's problem is poverty, not inequality.

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.240
[Amit Varma]: Inequality has become a fashionable term and a lot of people when they complain about inequality,

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:07.480
[Amit Varma]: they are at they actually mean poverty and poverty is our moral imperative.

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:08.840
[Amit Varma]: That's what we have to solve.

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:12.880
[Amit Varma]: And the kind of policies which would tackle poverty and inequality are very different

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:18.560
[Amit Varma]: and almost opposite in some cases, which is why I feel that that's distinction which otherwise

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:22.520
[Amit Varma]: seems merely semantic is important.

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:25.680
[Guest]: So you know, we were talking about things that need to be done.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:30.000
[Guest]: Now, one of the things is, you know, if you look at the ability of tax authorities to

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.440
[Guest]: harass us, that continues to remain high.

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:36.920
[Guest]: In fact, I was just reading a news report a few days back, wherein, you know, the tax

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:41.080
[Guest]: authorities have been asked to raise their income tax collections, right?

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:47.000
[Guest]: Now, you know, in an economy which is growing at 7% nominally, the income tax collections

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.440
[Guest]: cannot grow at 20%, right?

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:53.680
[Guest]: So when you force them to sort of raise collections, how is that going to happen?

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:56.600
[Guest]: That's only going to happen through harassment.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:04.600
[Guest]: And the moment you you start harassing entrepreneurs, I mean, you are essentially helping kill the

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:09.400
[Amit Varma]: entire idea of entrepreneurship, I mean, I mean, the term people use for this is tax

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:10.920
[Guest]: terrorism, right?

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:15.640
[Guest]: So, so this this has to go and you know, there are no silver bullets as such.

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:20.280
[Guest]: I mean, there are the all these points which have been written about debated about labor

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:21.280
[Amit Varma]: laws and everything.

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.280
[Amit Varma]: Everything.

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it's all well known.

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:24.280
[Guest]: It's not like they don't know.

01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:28.620
[Guest]: And what I find funny is when you know, the Minister of Finance asks for suggestions from

01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:31.160
[Guest]: people on what she should do in the budget.

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I just find that bizarre.

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:36.360
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, as if she doesn't know what is to be done.

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.040
[Amit Varma]: And if she doesn't know, she doesn't.

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:41.640
[Amit Varma]: As if a lot of it wasn't in the 2014 manifesto.

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:45.680
[Amit Varma]: I had the Congress politician Salman shows on my show a few months ago.

01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:50.120
[Amit Varma]: And he was saying how when Mr. Modi came to power in 2014, he in the Congress was actually

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:53.960
[Amit Varma]: a little bit hopeful, because there was a lot in their manifesto, which he agreed with

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.560
[Amit Varma]: in terms of reforms, and they've carried out none of those.

01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:01.840
[Guest]: In fact, these days, there's this I mean, what I find really bizarre is that there is

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:06.640
[Guest]: this small scale industry which has come up with things that redistribution will lead

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:07.800
[Guest]: to economic growth.

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:11.960
[Guest]: I mean, I find that I mean, you know, whether you are in favor of redistribution or against

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.080
[Guest]: it is a different argument.

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:18.440
[Guest]: But redistribution has not led to development anywhere in the world, right?

01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:21.600
[Guest]: I mean, there's a trade off between redistribution and growth.

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.760
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes you make that trade off on the side of redistribution, because you feel it's

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.880
[Amit Varma]: a moral imperative, you have to help the poor.

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:29.520
[Guest]: But you should have to be aware that there is a trade off.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:34.480
[Guest]: And also, you know, redistribution can also only happen once some wealth has been created,

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:35.480
[Guest]: right?

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:40.400
[Guest]: Like, you know, I remember this line from this, this movie, which Ketan Mehta made with

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:44.960
[Guest]: Shah Rukh Khan and his wife, Deepa, it was called Oh, Darling, Yeh Hai India.

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:49.720
[Guest]: And there's a line in the in the title song of the movie, which goes Jo bacha nahi, wo

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.160
[Guest]: baat diya.

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:54.760
[Guest]: So what you haven't saved, that also you're distributing.

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:59.680
[Guest]: I mean, so obviously, you're going to get so redistribution beyond the point where there

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:02.880
[Amit Varma]: is I mean, what do you redistribute, you need to first earn that money to redistribute it.

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:06.400
[Amit Varma]: This goes to the point that people often make about the Scandinavian states, that what about

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:11.000
[Amit Varma]: the Scandinavian states, their welfare states, the point to note is that they were incredible

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:16.280
[Amit Varma]: free markets until the point that they got so massively prosperous, that on their small

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:21.520
[Amit Varma]: scales, they could actually afford to become welfare states and tax a lot and redistribute

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:22.520
[Amit Varma]: a lot.

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:25.520
[Amit Varma]: And they actually started turning back on some of that when it started hurting, but

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:26.840
[Guest]: they were already at very prosperous.

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:31.280
[Guest]: Also, what people don't get is that as far as entrepreneurship is concerned, it still

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:33.760
[Guest]: thrives out there.

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.360
[Unknown]: I mean, people are encouraged.

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:36.360
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:39.040
[Guest]: So being a welfare state doesn't mean that you don't let people do business.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly.

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.560
[Amit Varma]: And this is something that people don't get.

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:43.560
[Guest]: What about Scandinavia?

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.280
[Guest]: First, look at the per capita income.

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:50.240
[Amit Varma]: And also, you know, like Elkar and Shah in their book, they make a very interesting observation

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:53.880
[Amit Varma]: also, where they point out that one data point worth looking at very closely is the flight

01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:55.240
[Amit Varma]: of millionaires.

01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:58.360
[Amit Varma]: And this might seem completely irrelevant to a poor country that let the millionaires

01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.840
[Amit Varma]: go, what difference does it make?

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:04.600
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, these are your wealth creators, who generate jobs, who generate employment,

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:08.880
[Amit Varma]: who generate growth, who are all choosing to leave en masse.

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:11.920
[Amit Varma]: And what you do not see what is seen as a flight of these millionaires, but what is

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:17.200
[Amit Varma]: then unseen is a many other prospective millionaires who don't come up who would in a counterfactual

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:21.600
[Amit Varma]: because you've created conditions that are antithetical if you want to create

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:22.600
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:26.520
[Guest]: Ultimately, you know, growth is the only antidote to poverty.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:31.280
[Guest]: And this is a simple point that, you know, which our politicians don't seem to understand.

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:35.720
[Guest]: And by politicians, I don't just mean the current set, but all of them in general.

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:40.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, yeah, you know, one one interesting observation that I completely agree with that

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:44.040
[Amit Varma]: which our friend Shruti Rajgopalan, who's also a frequent guest, I made in a column

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:49.040
[Amit Varma]: which came out today, we are recording on December 24, is that this what is happening

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:54.160
[Amit Varma]: in India currently, both in social terms with the CIA and all of this and also in economic

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:58.920
[Amit Varma]: terms, displays the government social engineering mindset, or you could say the engineering

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:03.960
[Amit Varma]: mindset, where they have a vision of society and they want to create it with all of these

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:09.160
[Amit Varma]: top down actions, whether it is in a social context, or whether it is in the economic

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:10.160
[Amit Varma]: context.

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:14.360
[Amit Varma]: And there still isn't the realization that social engineering never works.

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:19.480
[Amit Varma]: It always has terrible unintended consequences, that what the job of a state is to protect

01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:24.560
[Amit Varma]: the rights of every individual and then let them interact freely within the rule of law

01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:27.960
[Amit Varma]: so that everyone can, you know, reach their full potential.

01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:31.080
[Guest]: So, you know, so why don't you share the Mao example also?

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:32.080
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:35.320
[Amit Varma]: So the Mao example, which Kelkar and Shah used in their book, which is something that,

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, right after demonetization happened, the first column I wrote for the Times of

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:43.640
[Amit Varma]: India after that the example I gave was how Mao decided that because sparrows were destroying

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:46.120
[Amit Varma]: crops, all sparrows should be killed.

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.040
[Amit Varma]: So he gave an idea, kill all sparrows, right?

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:49.880
[Amit Varma]: That's his attempt at saving crops.

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:54.000
[Amit Varma]: But what happened was that the fragile ecosystem went completely out of whack, the sparrows

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.360
[Amit Varma]: were killed, and insects, especially locusts proliferated and the crops were destroyed

01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.360
[Amit Varma]: anyway.

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:00.960
[Amit Varma]: And it was a massive economic disaster.

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:05.840
[Amit Varma]: Now, what this tells you is that a certain kind of social engineering on such a grand

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:10.880
[Amit Varma]: scale is flawed, even if you cannot predict exactly what will happen, people may not have

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:14.960
[Amit Varma]: known the ecosystem so well to know that if sparrows are killed, locusts will destroy

01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:16.200
[Amit Varma]: the crops.

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:21.320
[Amit Varma]: But simply because there are all these massive unintended consequences, that you should keep

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:27.040
[Amit Varma]: your interventions as small and local and measurable and reversible as possible all

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:30.560
[Amit Varma]: points which Kelkar and Shah make in the episode you'll hear next week.

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:35.320
[Amit Varma]: And and for that reason, you know, such social engineering always backfires and is similar

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:38.040
[Amit Varma]: to what Modi tried with demonetization.

01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:42.640
[Amit Varma]: That's a comparison I then made and which Kelkar and Shah also made in this book that

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:47.480
[Amit Varma]: such grand attempts at social engineering always fail and yet, we have this engineering

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:52.320
[Amit Varma]: mindset all around us, where people imagine that because they can design a machine or

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:57.280
[Amit Varma]: they can run a company that they can actually design an economy and construct a society

01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:02.440
[Amit Varma]: and that simply isn't possible, it is always bound to fail and has led to nothing but heartbreak

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:06.840
[Amit Varma]: and misery every time it's been tried through the 20th century by both the left wing and

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:07.840
[Guest]: the right wing.

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:14.880
[Guest]: Right, so I think, you know, one of the things that we still haven't talked about is 2019

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:20.400
[Guest]: was also the year when our monetary policy went for a toss.

01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:22.520
[Amit Varma]: What is monetary policy for up for my listeners?

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:23.520
[Guest]: Just explain.

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:29.240
[Guest]: Monetary policy is basically the interest rate policy that the nation's central bank

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.240
[Guest]: decides on.

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:31.240
[Amit Varma]: So is the RBI decides.

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:36.120
[Guest]: The RBI in the Indian case through the Monetary Policy Committee decides on.

01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:42.240
[Guest]: So they decide to sort of either raise or, you know, decrease what is called as what

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:43.880
[Guest]: is called the repo rate.

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:50.200
[Guest]: So repo rate is the rate at which the RBI gives loans to banks.

01:38:50.200 --> 01:39:01.480
[Guest]: So Shaktikanta Das led RBI has cut the repo rate by 135 basis points from 6.5% to 5.15%.

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:08.440
[Guest]: The hope was that banks would also cut interest rates as the RBI cut the repo rate.

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.840
[Guest]: Now, what has happened instead is that if you look at the weighted average lending rate

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:17.560
[Guest]: of banks, instead of going down, it's gone up.

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:24.960
[Guest]: So it's gone up from around 10.35% at the beginning of the year to 10.4% I think as

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:27.440
[Guest]: of October, if I remember correctly.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.000
[Guest]: So now what has happened?

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.280
[Guest]: I mean, this is something that a lot of people are baffled about.

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:37.800
[Guest]: And you know, what you need to understand here is, again, if you're the kind who just

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:43.160
[Guest]: reads Times of India, you will see that every time there is a repo rate cut, the next day

01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:48.520
[Guest]: the headline that is run is repo rate cut, home loan EMIs, EMIs, whatever, vehicle EMIs

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:49.620
[Guest]: to come down.

01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:51.880
[Guest]: But that's not how it actually works.

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:54.560
[Guest]: Now, how does a bank operate?

01:39:54.560 --> 01:40:01.920
[Guest]: You know, a bank borrows money from all of us, and then it lends money at a higher rate.

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:08.760
[Guest]: Now, if you look at the cost of borrowing, which is primarily through deposits, so if

01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:14.280
[Guest]: you look at the cost of borrowing of term deposits of banks, it's gone down slightly

01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:21.040
[Guest]: in the last, since the beginning of this year, it's gone down by around 12 basis points.

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:27.000
[Guest]: And the RBI has cut rate by 135 basis points.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:36.000
[Guest]: So unless the cost of deposits come down, the lending rate on loans will not come down.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.840
[Guest]: I mean, this is as basic as it gets, the RBI can keep cutting the repo rate.

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:44.760
[Guest]: Now, why is the cost of deposits not coming down?

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:50.400
[Guest]: Now, if you remember what we sort of talked about earlier, I had said that the financial

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:59.440
[Guest]: savings, the net financial savings of India as a whole has come down in the last few years.

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:01.480
[Guest]: And I explained as to why it has come down.

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:10.400
[Guest]: Now, in this scenario, banks, in order to encourage people to save, need to offer them

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:16.480
[Guest]: a good rate of interest, so they are not in a position to cut interest rates, or not as

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:18.800
[Guest]: much as the RBI wants them to.

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:22.680
[Guest]: The other thing that has happened, and a lot of people don't seem to know about this, is

01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:30.280
[Guest]: that the overall public sector borrowing, and by this, I mean, the real deficit run

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:35.880
[Guest]: by the central government, these fiscal deficits of the state governments, the borrowings of

01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:41.440
[Guest]: organizations like the Food Corporation of India, this has gone up over the years, I

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:45.400
[Guest]: mean, it used to be around 8% of the GDP, now it's more than 9%.

01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:52.880
[Guest]: So in an environment where the financial savings have come down, government borrowing is going

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:53.920
[Guest]: up.

01:41:53.920 --> 01:42:02.160
[Guest]: So in this environment, expecting interest rates to fall is a little silly, okay.

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:04.560
[Guest]: So now what does this tell us?

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:11.000
[Guest]: It tells us as to how intricately linked everything is in the economy, right?

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:16.880
[Guest]: I mean, you know, it tells us as to, given the fact that India has gone the way it has,

01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:20.920
[Guest]: where investment is not happening, because of that consumption is being financed through

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.640
[Guest]: savings.

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:26.880
[Guest]: And because consumption is being financed through increased savings, you know, savings

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:27.880
[Guest]: have fallen.

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:31.960
[Guest]: And because of that, banks cannot cut interest rates on their deposits.

01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:35.120
[Guest]: And because of that, they can't cut interest rates on their loans.

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:39.600
[Guest]: It's all, you know, in economics, they used to teach the vicious circle of poverty.

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:42.080
[Guest]: India is poor because India is poor.

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:48.160
[Guest]: So this is sort of, you know, the vicious circle of India's lack of economic growth.

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:50.460
[Guest]: I mean, if we can call it that.

01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:53.720
[Guest]: So this is something that, you know, has to be tackled.

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:59.000
[Guest]: The only way it can be tackled is through increased savings, right?

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.720
[Guest]: Now, how will people increase savings?

01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:07.760
[Guest]: One is if they consume less, but if they consume less, it hurts the economy, right?

01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.360
[Guest]: So the way to increase savings is essentially to increase incomes.

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:17.360
[Guest]: Now, in order to increase incomes, investment has to happen.

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:22.280
[Guest]: For investment to happen, the government has to create the right conditions.

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:27.400
[Guest]: Also, before that, the consumption slowdown has to unravel, because businesses won't invest

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:30.400
[Guest]: until, you know, consumers start consuming.

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:34.880
[Guest]: So to sort of solve that problem, you know, one of the things that the government could

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:41.560
[Guest]: have done is to cut down on the personal income tax rates, but they chose to cut down on corporate

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:46.720
[Guest]: taxes, which helped no one because it just helped push up corporate earnings, and money

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:50.320
[Guest]: did not end up in the hands of people who could spend it.

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:54.480
[Guest]: So yeah, I mean, so this is basically, you know, how intricately linked everything is.

01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:57.400
[Guest]: And at times, it's not the solutions are not.

01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:01.780
[Amit Varma]: No, and I have like two thoughts kind of strike me in response to this.

01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:05.040
[Amit Varma]: One is, of course, how incredible perverse it is that while private savings are going

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:10.400
[Amit Varma]: down, government borrowing is going up, that while private consumption is growing at a

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:14.880
[Amit Varma]: slower pace, government spending is going up, you know, and the one way of getting out

01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:18.840
[Amit Varma]: of this vicious cycle where we are saving less and spending less because we have lower

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:22.640
[Amit Varma]: incomes is, of course, like you pointed out, a cut in the personal income tax rate so that

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:28.960
[Amit Varma]: people just have more to sort of, you leave more money with the people to spend, so that

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:33.240
[Amit Varma]: they will spend more and save more, and that can help us come out of that cycle.

01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:37.520
[Amit Varma]: The other sort of thing that struck me was how you pointed out that everything is so

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:43.720
[Amit Varma]: intricately linked, which is also why people in government imagine that with public policy

01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:49.120
[Amit Varma]: by using different levers, one lever here, one lever there, they can influence the process,

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:53.320
[Amit Varma]: not having the humility to realize that the process is so deeply complicated that every

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:57.600
[Amit Varma]: intervention has unintended consequences, and therefore, you're better off sticking

01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:00.640
[Amit Varma]: to certain first principles.

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:08.760
[Guest]: And basically, you're better off just letting people carry out honest entrepreneurial activity.

01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:13.440
[Guest]: As long as you do that, you know, you will get your share of taxes, people will make

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:18.880
[Guest]: their share of income and, but as you know, it's it's easier said than done.

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:19.880
[Guest]: So, right.

01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:24.760
[Amit Varma]: So, so, you know, certainly, you've looked at the economy very closely for like 15, 16

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:29.640
[Amit Varma]: years or whatever, and year on year, you know, things have changed, you look at the data,

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.080
[Amit Varma]: how have your feelings about what is happening evolved over this time?

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:35.900
[Amit Varma]: And do you feel that 2019 is particularly worse?

01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:37.720
[Amit Varma]: Is there a reason to be worried?

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:44.280
[Guest]: Like, I mean, yes, I mean, 2019 has been worse from the data point of view, there is no denying

01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:49.520
[Guest]: that but I think what I find more worrying and, and I've said this many times before

01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:55.520
[Guest]: is the brazenness of this government in not admitting that there is a problem.

01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:01.160
[Guest]: I mean, as I say, over and over again, is how do you solve a problem without admitting

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:02.160
[Guest]: to it?

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:03.160
[Guest]: Right.

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:10.760
[Guest]: So, I mean, so unless you do that, I mean, yeah, I hope in 2020, they see, I mean, they

01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:14.600
[Guest]: lose a few more elections, and finally, some sense comes in.

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:15.600
[Amit Varma]: So, yeah,

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.120
[Guest]: But it's less likely to lead to economic reforms and more likely to lead to social polarization.

01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:26.040
[Guest]: Even more rhetoric of the kind that is not good for the, I mean, I'm just waiting for

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:29.760
[Amit Varma]: them to come up with the population rhetoric and blame the failures of governments on too

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:30.760
[Amit Varma]: many people.

01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:33.360
[Amit Varma]: And that's so totally going to happen.

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:40.360
[Amit Varma]: We've kind of, you know, spoken about 2019 and how dismal it has been in 2020.

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:41.360
[Amit Varma]: What will save us?

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.280
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of the things I think about in these troubled times is that what will

01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:49.280
[Amit Varma]: save us is art, like, I look around me and not just in the protest movements, but even

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:53.880
[Amit Varma]: in general, the quality of cartooning has just gone to a new level, because there is

01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:59.160
[Amit Varma]: so much happening that is so surreal that, you know, comics have so much material to

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:00.160
[Guest]: play with.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:04.360
[Guest]: In fact, I was just thinking about it the other day, and that, so there used to be one

01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:09.920
[Guest]: of the big protest poets in Pakistan was a gentleman called Habib Jaleeb.

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:15.800
[Guest]: And he wrote some of his best poetry under the dictatorship of Zia-ul-Haq.

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:22.480
[Guest]: And a couple of his, you know, famous poems, one is called Main Nahin Manta and the other

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:25.160
[Guest]: is called Hukmara.

01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:30.320
[Guest]: It's essentially about intellectuals who kowtow to the government.

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:35.160
[Guest]: And he'd written it on this other big Pakistani poet called Hafiz Jalandhri, who had essentially

01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:37.080
[Guest]: become an advisor to Ayub Khan.

01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:38.080
[Guest]: Anyway, that's different.

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:43.520
[Guest]: But what I'm trying to say is that, Habib Jaleeb would have been proud with the kind

01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:48.320
[Guest]: of protest poetry that's coming out now, especially the one that, you know, Varun Glover,

01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.320
[Amit Varma]: Hum Kagaz Nahin Dikhayenge,

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.320
[Amit Varma]: Hum Kagaz Nahin Dikhayenge,

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:54.760
[Amit Varma]: which is brilliant, and which, which works for all 72 years of India, boss, if you kind

01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:55.760
[Guest]: of look at it.

01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:01.440
[Guest]: I mean, the simplicity of it is just, I mean, the way he captures the emotion is just superb.

01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:02.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's just superb.

01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:06.760
[Amit Varma]: And similar sound and I think same number of syllables as to Hum Mandir Wahin Banayenge.

01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:09.760
[Amit Varma]: Which is, which is the point, which is the point, right?

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:10.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's brilliant.

01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:11.760
[Amit Varma]: Which is how he…

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:12.760
[Guest]: Hum Kagaz Nahin Dikhayenge,

01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:13.760
[Amit Varma]: Hum Mandir Wahin Banayenge.

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:16.760
[Amit Varma]: So, Vivek, iss, iss mauke pe aap bhi kuchh suna do yaar.

01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:17.760
[Guest]: Haan, actually.

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:23.600
[Guest]: So, this is something by, I mean, I wish I could write poetry like the way our great

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:24.760
[Guest]: Urdu poets do.

01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:30.040
[Guest]: So, this is a poem by Rahat Indori, not a poem, it's just a couplet by Rahat Indori,

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:33.560
[Guest]: who is one of the greatest Urdu poets alive.

01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:37.360
[Guest]: And it's in the context of whatever is happening in India right now.

01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:42.800
[Guest]: And he says, ke adhe the zith pe, ki sooraj bana ke chhodenge, ke adhe the zith pe, ki

01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:47.560
[Guest]: sooraj bana ke chhodenge, paseene chhoot gaye ek diya banane me.

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:52.600
[Guest]: So, you know, it's very difficult to build the most simple of things.

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:56.400
[Guest]: So forget about, you know, big things like demonetization and…

01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:01.760
[Amit Varma]: We were adamant that we will build a new sun and yet we are sweating over a mere candle

01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:04.160
[Amit Varma]: on the spot, off the cuff.

01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:06.360
[Amit Varma]: Translation by me, please forgive if something went wrong.

01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:08.360
[Guest]: No, no, it's perfectly right.

01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:12.880
[Guest]: So, in fact, you have a job coming up as a translator.

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:14.880
[Amit Varma]: I have no job.

01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:20.400
[Guest]: Given that both of us, you know, the economic activities that we indulge in aren't really

01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:21.400
[Guest]: happening.

01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:26.040
[Guest]: So, we are poor podcasters who are doing this for the love of it and the greater benefit

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:27.040
[Guest]: of mankind.

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:28.040
[Amit Varma]: Humankind.

01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:29.040
[Amit Varma]: Humankind.

01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Humankind.

01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:33.760
[Amit Varma]: So kindly watch your language, we shall instantly cancel you.

01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:38.520
[Amit Varma]: All episodes of Vivek Kaul will disappear from the scene in the scene archives.

01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:40.960
[Amit Varma]: So should I ask you the hope and despair question, boss?

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:41.960
[Amit Varma]: Yes, sure.

01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:42.960
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:43.960
[Guest]: So consider it asked.

01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:48.160
[Guest]: What gives you hope and what gives you despair about 2020 since we were speaking at the granular

01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:49.160
[Guest]: level of a year?

01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:56.080
[Guest]: I think the despair is obviously what is happening all around us and the fact that the media

01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:57.080
[Guest]: has been so subdued.

01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:02.720
[Guest]: In fact, you know, one tends to get more news from what people share on the social media

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:04.960
[Guest]: now than the real media.

01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:11.160
[Guest]: I mean, like the other day, there was this huge march in Dharavi, I mean, which barely

01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:17.200
[Guest]: made it to the newspapers, whereas it was there all over the social media.

01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:24.840
[Guest]: So that is the huge and the fact that so many educated people, so many people in my immediate,

01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:34.720
[Guest]: you know, some of my best friends, immediate family, by this entire idea of NRC and, and

01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:37.240
[Guest]: the citizen amendment thing.

01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:43.960
[Guest]: So I find that very, very disturbing because, I mean, when the people you're closest to

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:47.920
[Guest]: believe in these things, I mean, how do you talk to them?

01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.960
[Guest]: Or more than that, why should you talk to them?

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:53.240
[Guest]: Forget how do you talk to them?

01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:55.680
[Guest]: That really is disturbing me.

01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:59.360
[Guest]: The hope obviously, at the end of the day, as I've always said, is the people of India,

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:04.320
[Guest]: because I mean, and that's been shown in the last few days, where people have actually

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:10.680
[Guest]: come out, you know, against what, you know, Modi and Shah have been trying to do.

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:17.000
[Guest]: And so that gives you hope and you know, the funny thing is, and I was just thinking about

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:22.920
[Guest]: it the other day that, you know, when Modi made this speech in Delhi, and he said that,

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:32.200
[Guest]: whatever he did about NRC and the fact that, you know, Amit Shah had sort of contradicted

01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:34.560
[Guest]: it over and over again.

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:42.480
[Guest]: So I was I was just wondering, you know, has Narendra Modi also reached a stage where he's

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:47.200
[Guest]: become the mukhota of the BJP?

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:50.760
[Amit Varma]: I think that's wishful thinking, I think, without necessarily thinking of it in those

01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:55.120
[Amit Varma]: terms are kind of playing good cop, bad cop, and also, a large part of the population will

01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:56.820
[Amit Varma]: believe anything they say.

01:51:56.820 --> 01:52:02.520
[Guest]: So Modi can just say, that's the thing, you know, what they're basically doing is that,

01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:06.160
[Guest]: you know, one guy is saying one thing, the other guy is saying the other thing.

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:10.200
[Amit Varma]: And basically, all kinds of audiences taken care of, I mean, I'm going to invoke the philosopher

01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:14.800
[Amit Varma]: Harry Frankfurt, Harry Frankfurt wrote the superb essay in 1986, which later was released

01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:20.280
[Amit Varma]: as a book in 2003, called On Bullshit, where he said that bullshit is different from lies.

01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:24.240
[Amit Varma]: Lies is when you care about the truth, you acknowledge the truth, but you choose to deliberately

01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:25.960
[Amit Varma]: deceive somebody by lying.

01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:28.240
[Amit Varma]: Bullshit, it has no relationship with the truth.

01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:32.600
[Amit Varma]: You don't care if what you are saying is true or untrue.

01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:35.360
[Amit Varma]: You just say it at the spur of the moment, because it sounds good.

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:36.640
[Amit Varma]: And it's a thing to say.

01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:40.080
[Amit Varma]: And this is true for a lot of things Donald Trump says on Twitter.

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:43.320
[Amit Varma]: And once of course, having come up with some spontaneous bullshit, he will always keep

01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:44.840
[Amit Varma]: doubling down on it.

01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:50.440
[Amit Varma]: But I think of, for example, Modi's speech as like, of course, it was full of untruths.

01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:51.440
[Amit Varma]: But was he lying?

01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:52.440
[Amit Varma]: Or was he bullshitting?

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:57.680
[Amit Varma]: And that's, that's a question I'll leave it to listeners to answer.

01:52:57.680 --> 01:52:58.680
[Amit Varma]: Any final comments?

01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:00.160
[Amit Varma]: You did not mention what gives you hope?

01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:08.120
[Guest]: I said the hopes, the people, I mean, people as in the, you know, at least some of them

01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:12.960
[Guest]: who will probably end up doing the right thing.

01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:13.960
[Guest]: Not all of them, actually.

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:14.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:20.920
[Amit Varma]: So on that, on that bleak yet hopeful note, we shall end this episode of The Seen and

01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:21.920
[Amit Varma]: the Unseen.

01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:22.920
[Amit Varma]: Thanks for coming on the show, man, Vivek.

01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:26.560
