00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
[Amit Varma]: I have often asked myself the question, what does it mean to be Indian? In recent weeks,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.920
[Amit Varma]: I have also started asking myself the question, what does it mean to be an Indian citizen?

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.800
[Amit Varma]: We often take it for granted that we are citizens, but citizenship has so many rich shades of

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.360
[Amit Varma]: meaning. On the one hand, it's an administrative category, denoting the basic unit of the population

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.600
[Amit Varma]: of a state. On another, it's a term loaded with virtue and duty, which is why we speak

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.920
[Amit Varma]: of what it means to be a good citizen. The term citizen refers to a legal status. It

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.280
[Amit Varma]: also encloses an understanding of rights that the state is supposed to protect and entitlements

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.840
[Amit Varma]: that it might have granted one. It implies duties that one might have, definitely civic

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.840
[Amit Varma]: and perhaps social and political as well. It presupposes a sense of identity and belonging.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.740
[Amit Varma]: It's a term especially loaded with meaning in modern times, because being a citizen is

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.340
[Amit Varma]: different from being a subject. A handful of centuries ago, we were all subjects of

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.280
[Amit Varma]: some empire or fiefdom or the other. In 1947, when India gained political independence,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.240
[Amit Varma]: we also gained the right for every Indian to turn from a subject to a citizen, empowered

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.040
[Amit Varma]: at an individual level to be masters of the state. Though I would argue that we still

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.200
[Amit Varma]: have the mentality of subjects. Citizenship is something that we all tend to take for

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.720
[Amit Varma]: granted. Although the events of the last weeks have forced many Indians to sit up and re-examine

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.400
[Amit Varma]: what the word means. What does it mean to be an Indian citizen? Although there are articles

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.320
[Amit Varma]: in the constitution and laws passed by Parliament on this subject, one basic truth remains.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.240
[Amit Varma]: Our citizenship is what we make of it.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.800
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.680
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.960
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen. Before we get started, a quick announcement. My partnership

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.160
[Amit Varma]: with the good folks at IVM podcast has ended and as of this week, starting with this episode,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.120
[Amit Varma]: I will be producing The Seen and the Unseen myself. We did 151 episodes together and IVM

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.080
[Amit Varma]: was as much a labour of love for Amit Doshi and his team as The Seen and the Unseen has

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.160
[Amit Varma]: been for me, where the work has had to be its own reward because there hasn't been much

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.000
[Amit Varma]: else. Our parting was both inevitable and amicable and I wish IVM the very best. You

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.960
[Amit Varma]: can check out their collection of amazing Indian podcasts at ivmpodcast.com. Now on

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.480
[Amit Varma]: to this episode. We are recording this episode on December 20th and India has been on fire

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.160
[Amit Varma]: over the last few days over a new bill that the government has passed called the Citizenship

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.240
[Amit Varma]: Amendment Bill or the CAB. Taken in conjunction with the proposed National Register for Indian

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.640
[Amit Varma]: Citizens, this bill has certain implications that has many Indians worried, including me.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.760
[Amit Varma]: The CAB and the NRC and the competing notions of citizenship that are now being argued in

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.080
[Amit Varma]: the public discourse all carry enormous historical baggage. We cannot understand these present

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.480
[Amit Varma]: times if we do not understand that history. To help unpack all of this, I have invited

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.280
[Amit Varma]: my friend, the historian Srinath Raghavan back on the show. Srinath had last appeared

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.920
[Amit Varma]: in The Seen and the Unseen to discuss the troubled history of Kashmir and Article 370

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.880
[Amit Varma]: and that episode turned out to be the most popular episode of The Seen and the Unseen

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.960
[Amit Varma]: so far. He's done three other fantastic episodes with me before that, all of which will be

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.480
[Amit Varma]: linked from the show notes at seenunseen.in. I'm glad he'll join me here again today. Srinath,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.640
[Amit Varma]: welcome to the show. Good to be back on the new Seen and the Unseen. Yeah, Srinath, the

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.880
[Amit Varma]: last time you came here, it was on the back of a crisis about Article 370. And the time

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.360
[Amit Varma]: before that you came here, it could be argued that it presaged perhaps a future crisis with

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.280
[Amit Varma]: the India-Pakistan conflict where we, you know, after Balakot, we discussed the strategic

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.240
[Amit Varma]: implications of that. And we're in the middle of a bit of a crisis now also, aren't we?

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.320
[Guest]: Oh, yeah. And looks like this is a show for crisis and crisis management. Yeah. So you

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.400
[Amit Varma]: know, the thing is, a lot of people are asking, like when I was tweeting about this, a common

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.000
[Amit Varma]: question that people seem to have been programmed to ask almost, especially on day one, it almost

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.720
[Amit Varma]: seemed as if the IT cell had asked their anonymous handles to all, you know, comment asking protesters

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.800
[Amit Varma]: like us, what are the students protesting about, where the implication was that there's

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.440
[Amit Varma]: really nothing to protest. It's, you know, it's this bill has something to do with illegal

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.320
[Amit Varma]: migrants and all that. But the sort of historical implications of this are far greater if you

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.840
[Amit Varma]: look at the sort of larger picture. And one of the things that sort of struck me over

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.560
[Amit Varma]: the last three or four days is that, you know, when the bill was passed, I thought, okay,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.400
[Amit Varma]: we are living in really dark times, things are getting worse very fast. But I have been

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.800
[Amit Varma]: enormously heartened by the protests that have been happening in the last three days.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.240
[Amit Varma]: And I think in a sense, in a perverse way, the bill has had the opposite effect, whereas

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.120
[Amit Varma]: you would imagine it, you know, in conjunction with the NRC to take down the number of citizens

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.240
[Amit Varma]: in the country use, I think there are actually now suddenly many more citizens, so to say,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, if we use a distinction between thin citizenship, which is, you know, the

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.920
[Amit Varma]: legal status and thick citizenship where you actually involved with your nation, and people

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.600
[Amit Varma]: are suddenly taking the citizenship very seriously.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.880
[Guest]: Well, certainly, it seems to have catalyzed a largely unplanned spontaneous set of protest

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.600
[Guest]: movements across the country. And I think it's very interesting that this protest seems

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.000
[Guest]: to have a geographic reach, a sort of an institutional base in universities, not just of the old

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.960
[Guest]: public universities, but you know, in technological institutions and institutions of management,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.280
[Guest]: in private universities, all of it suggests that there is a breadth and a depth to this

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.540
[Guest]: feeling of antipathy towards what is being imposed on the country by way of amendment

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.600
[Guest]: of the Citizenship Amendment Bill. And I think people have caught on to what is fundamentally

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.160
[Guest]: problematic about the bill itself, which is that it effectively discriminates against

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.040
[Guest]: the Muslims in India, and de jure reduces them to second class status in this country,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.600
[Guest]: and that they feel is unjust, it's incorrect. And it goes against the fundamental tenets

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.160
[Guest]: of Indian identity, as they intuitively seem to understand was enshrined in the Constitution,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.180
[Guest]: which I think is very heartening, because as you've been saying, you know, we have witnessed

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.800
[Guest]: a number of important pieces of legislation, other kinds of court verdicts happening this

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.240
[Guest]: year, right, you had the Article 370 of Kashmir being abolished, the state being divided into

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:44.600
[Guest]: two union territories, then you had the Supreme Court verdict on the Ram Jan Bhoomi Ayodhya

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.600
[Guest]: issue, where, you know, on the one hand, the destruction of the Babri Mosque was condemned,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.360
[Guest]: but on the other hand, the people who destroyed it effectively have been given possession.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.200
[Guest]: It was both condemned and condoned. Exactly, right. So in a sense, coming on the

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.200
[Guest]: back of these series of things which has happened, it is quite interesting that people have looked

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.520
[Guest]: upon this as a moment where some of their fundamental questions of status, rights and

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.080
[Guest]: identity, you know, the bundle of things that go into the making of the notion of citizenship,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.520
[Guest]: as really being tested at this point of time. And it seems clear that they have decided

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.480
[Amit Varma]: that it's time to stand up. Right. And you know, one of the things which

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.520
[Amit Varma]: we're obviously going to do in this episode is talk about the historical background of

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.000
[Amit Varma]: all of this, both with the nature of citizenship, how it was in colonial India, the sort of

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.240
[Amit Varma]: battles in the Constituent Assembly at the time of independence to define it and set

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:41.600
[Amit Varma]: a direction forward and what it sort of revealed about the idea of India, the pluralistic idea

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.680
[Amit Varma]: of India that was then dominant among the framers of our constitution and problems of

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.600
[Amit Varma]: Assam and so on. So we look at the entire historical package. And we will also at the

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.640
[Amit Varma]: end cycle back to the present and talk about what's going on now and what the implications

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.080
[Amit Varma]: are. But before we do that, I want you to sum up for me, what are we protesting about

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.240
[Amit Varma]: exactly? You know, on the face of it, what many people seem to are saying on CAB and

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.560
[Amit Varma]: I get constantly on family WhatsApp groups, I get messages about it that what's the problem?

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.080
[Amit Varma]: This is only about refugees from other countries. It doesn't affect our citizenship. Why should

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.800
[Guest]: we be worried? Well, I think it we should be worried because the bill and the now the

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:25.520
[Guest]: act effectively is very clearly discriminatory. It creates explicitly stated discriminatory

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:32.880
[Guest]: provisions which leave out Muslims from getting citizenship as persecuted refugees from other

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:39.240
[Guest]: countries. It leaves out certain other countries are from the ambit of India's neighborhood.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.520
[Guest]: For instance, it leaves out Tamils who have come from Sri Lanka, and who are still living

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.520
[Guest]: in refugee camps in Tamil Nadu, maybe for about 25-30 years now. So there is a range

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:54.040
[Guest]: of exclusions, all of which meditate against the guarantee of equality to all enshrined

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.280
[Guest]: in Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. And in that sense, this bill seems patently

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.800
[Guest]: unconstitutional. But more than anything else, it seems to strike a chord with people that

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.920
[Guest]: here is a piece of legislation, which is so blatantly discriminatory, which attempts to

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:16.360
[Guest]: reduce a very large number of people in this country to effectively a new category of citizenship.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.160
[Guest]: And in that sense, you know, there have been parallels which have been evoked in a number

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.120
[Guest]: of fora with the Nuremberg laws of Germany, right? And it's it's worth recalling what

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.080
[Guest]: those Nuremberg laws were about. You know, the Nuremberg laws were one of the Nuremberg

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:34.000
[Guest]: laws effectively said that you could only be German if you're effectively of German

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.360
[Guest]: ancestry. And that German ancestry was defined as excluding the Jews. You know, people were

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.960
[Guest]: prohibited from getting married to Jews under the Nuremberg laws. So in a sense, it was

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:52.360
[Guest]: an attempt to preserve a certain majoritarian notion of German identity by consigning Jews

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.880
[Guest]: to second class citizenship. And that parallel, I think, has been evoked a number of times.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.920
[Guest]: It may not be accurate in all its particulars, but I think it strikes a chord because it

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.640
[Guest]: is precisely that kind of a problem. And let's also face it that we have seen similar things

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.920
[Guest]: happening in our own neighborhood in more recent times, you only have to think about

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.920
[Guest]: the Rohingya problem, as it emerged in the context of Myanmar, and the grotesque tragedy

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.320
[Guest]: into which it has devolved. Even as we are speaking, you know, there's a trial going

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.040
[Guest]: on in the International Court of Justice, and none less than Aung San Suu Kyi has had

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.320
[Guest]: to show up in order to defend the country. So I think people are worried about what kind

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:33.480
[Guest]: of a path are we embarking on by bringing in this piece of legislation. Now, the CAA,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:41.200
[Guest]: the amended act itself may seem exclusionary, innocuous, and so on. But it is effectively

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.080
[Guest]: a pincer movement when you combine it with the proposed National Register of Indian Citizens.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.080
[Guest]: Now this National Register of Indian Citizens actually was proposed by the Vajpayee government

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:56.480
[Guest]: in 2003. Right? There's a citizenship rules of 2003, which promulgated the process through

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.600
[Guest]: which this was to be done. Subsequently, when the UPA government came in, they set that

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.360
[Guest]: aside and focused more on other projects like Aadhaar as a way of giving identity and, you

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.640
[Guest]: know, enabling people to claim their rights and so on. But what the current government

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:16.480
[Guest]: wants to do effectively is to first bring in the CAB, which then says that then we will

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.600
[Guest]: move on to the NRC exercise of enumerating who's an Indian citizen, which will have various

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.720
[Guest]: kinds of requirements. As the case of Assam has shown, there are a lot of people, both

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.280
[Guest]: Hindu and Muslim, who will be unable to produce the required documents in order to meet the

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:37.080
[Guest]: threshold. But the amended Citizenship Act will allow everyone but the Muslims to go

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.320
[Guest]: through a process for claiming citizenship and eventually reach the destination. Whereas

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.560
[Guest]: Muslims who may be unable to have the requisite documentation in order to be able to do that

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.720
[Guest]: will then be consigned into some kind of a legal limbo. On top of it, we now know from

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.040
[Guest]: newspaper reporting that instructions have been given to various state governments to

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.680
[Guest]: open internment camps in various areas. Right? We are speaking here in Mumbai and there is

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.680
[Guest]: a camp coming up in Nehru as the, you know, the newspapers reported this as well. Yeah,

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.440
[Guest]: the newspapers reported it some months ago. And what is going to be the status of people

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:18.360
[Guest]: who are there? What kind of rights will they have? What kind of freedoms will they be allowed

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.520
[Guest]: to? In fact, if you look at the detention centers, which have been on operation in Assam

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.020
[Guest]: for some years now, even normal jail manual provisions are not being followed in those

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.400
[Guest]: kinds of things. There is a report done by Harsh Mandir a few years ago after a visit

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.840
[Guest]: to these things, which is worth reading. So, I think if you put the new amended Citizenship

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:46.480
[Guest]: Act along with the proposed NRC, you are effectively attempting to consign a very large number

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.720
[Guest]: of people in this country to second class citizenship and possibly throw them into a

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.960
[Guest]: legal limbo. And I think that is something that all of us have to be worried about. I

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:01.120
[Guest]: would in fact go a little further and say that we have to look at this piece of legislation

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.360
[Guest]: in the framework of the broader sets of things which have been attempted by the government.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:12.400
[Guest]: There was the criminalization of triple talaq. You know, triple talaq was a civil issue.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.900
[Guest]: Already the Supreme Court had ruled that it was illegal, it would not have any validity.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.360
[Guest]: But the government then goes on to bring a piece of legislation criminalizing a civil

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.720
[Guest]: matter, right, which then says that the Muslim man effectively is a deviant entity for whom

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.680
[Guest]: special criminal provisions need to be bought in which need not be bought in for other communities

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:38.440
[Guest]: and people of other religions. Then you had Article 370 being abolished. So, a constitutionally

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:44.560
[Guest]: guaranteed set of provisions for some degree of autonomy, which in practice were never

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:52.920
[Guest]: observed for the one Muslim majority state in this country was ostentatiously and unconstitutionally

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.120
[Guest]: without the concurrence of the state assembly done away with and that state has been divided

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.480
[Guest]: into two. And then, of course, as I said, you've had the Ayodhya verdict, all of which

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:06.800
[Guest]: put together suggests that, you know, a very large zone of exclusion in legal constitutional

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:13.040
[Guest]: terms is being created for Muslims in this country, or at least that is a fear. And it

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.360
[Guest]: is not just about Muslims, because any such exclusions from provisions of citizenship

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.960
[Guest]: of rights, which have been guaranteed by the constitution, apply equally to every one of

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:27.480
[Guest]: us. It is not just about them, but it is about us. And I think that is the feeling that the

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.960
[Guest]: people who are coming out in streets in such large numbers, in totally uncoordinated unplanned

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:40.520
[Guest]: ways to let out their feelings against what seems to be a patently discriminatory, unfair,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.320
[Guest]: unjust regime, which is now being instituted.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:48.720
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely. And I'll sort of state two responses to that. One is just to elaborate on what

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.340
[Amit Varma]: you said about the whole process of the natural register of Indian citizens coming about.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.840
[Amit Varma]: One thing that people keep saying on Twitter and WhatsApp and so on, is that, hey, listen,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.580
[Amit Varma]: why are you worried if you're an Indian citizen, just prove your citizenship, and that's fine.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.200
[Amit Varma]: But how do you prove your citizenship? I mean, I don't at this moment in time know if even

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:11.280
[Amit Varma]: I have the papers, someone as privileged as me, to be able to prove my citizenship. And

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.760
[Amit Varma]: I want to quote from a piece that Sanjeev Barua wrote for Frontline, where he talks

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.760
[Amit Varma]: about you know, the difficulty in proving this, where he says, quote, the NRC exercise

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.920
[Amit Varma]: and he's talking about what happened last year in Assam, essentially, where this exercise

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:30.560
[Amit Varma]: actually took place. And he writes, quote, the NRC exercise exemplifies the fact that

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.600
[Amit Varma]: contrary to the talk of a paperless society, the growing use of electronic technologies

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.920
[Amit Varma]: has actually increased the need for paper documents and underline their importance in

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.960
[Amit Varma]: people's lives. Legacy data are at the heart of the process. To be included in the NRC,

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:50.840
[Amit Varma]: someone has to identify an ancestor whose name appears in either the NRC of 1951, or

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:56.680
[Amit Varma]: a pre 1971 electoral roll, and provides documentary evidence of linkage with that person, even

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.600
[Amit Varma]: with the substantial assistance available at the NRC Seva Kendras. This can be a challenge

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:07.040
[Amit Varma]: for many people. And he continues later, consider a person who lives in Assam, but was not born

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.720
[Amit Varma]: in the state. In order to process his or her legacy data, NRC officials have had to make

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:19.320
[Amit Varma]: as many as 600,000 requests for legacy verification to various state governments. The response

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:25.600
[Amit Varma]: from them has been poor and tardy. Some states responded to fewer than 1% of the requests.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.760
[Amit Varma]: More than 100,000 requests for legacy verification were made to the West Bengal government. But

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:35.600
[Amit Varma]: the NRC authorities received responses only in 6.5% of the requests, stop quote. And you

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.800
[Amit Varma]: know, we've all seen newspaper stories about how even ex army officers like the other day

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.160
[Amit Varma]: I read about some ex army officer who fought in the Kargil war, now being in a detention

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:50.200
[Amit Varma]: camp because he doesn't have the papers to prove that he's a citizen. And the thing is,

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:55.160
[Amit Varma]: because like it is fortunate given bureaucracy that a lot of papers can just be got with

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.160
[Amit Varma]: such jugaad like ration cards and so on. But what this also means is that they are not

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:05.000
[Amit Varma]: accepted as evidence of citizenship. And therefore, it's just extremely difficult to prove your

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.560
[Amit Varma]: citizenship for literally anybody. And if and this brings me to the second observation,

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.840
[Amit Varma]: that if you are already of the mindset that you want to other a certain set of people,

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.720
[Amit Varma]: then this becomes a fantastic mechanism by which to do so. Well, you can say that, okay,

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:27.360
[Amit Varma]: you can't prove your citizenship. But if you're a Hindu, you know, under the CAB, we can still

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:33.680
[Amit Varma]: sort of grant your citizenship, but not Muslims because Muslims are specifically excluded

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.960
[Amit Varma]: from the CAB. Now, my sort of question here is like one observation, which I think you'll

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:44.200
[Amit Varma]: agree with is that one doubt that a lot of people had about how serious this dispensation

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.800
[Amit Varma]: is about a social agenda is now sort of laid to rest. They're very serious. I mean, I want

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.120
[Amit Varma]: to make three points. This is one. The second point is something that Akar Patel said on

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.100
[Amit Varma]: an episode with me a long time back when we discussed Hindutva, where he said that how

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:03.240
[Amit Varma]: do you define a Hindu Rashtra? And when it comes to like an Islamic state, or an Islamic

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:09.280
[Amit Varma]: nation, it's very easy. There are certain positive laws which apply to what, you know,

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.880
[Amit Varma]: good Muslims must do. But the notion of a Hindu Rashtra basically seems to rest on othering

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.440
[Amit Varma]: and on being anti Muslim. So if you look at all of like I also did an episode on the Gita

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.720
[Amit Varma]: Press with Akshay Mukul, where he spoke about this whole developing movement. And if you

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.280
[Amit Varma]: look at all these major tropes of the Hindutva movement, whether it's cow slaughter or love

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:35.080
[Amit Varma]: jihad, or, you know, since independence, a Hindu code bill, and therefore the UCC, they

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:41.120
[Amit Varma]: all come down to a sense of let's get at the Muslims. And my third point is that one might

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.840
[Amit Varma]: have thought that the kind of polarization that is now happening, and and the kind of

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.480
[Amit Varma]: effect that this kind of othering rhetoric has is something that the BJP might have been

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.960
[Amit Varma]: using for winning votes alone. But the point is, if that was the case, then so soon after

00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.480
[Amit Varma]: an election, when they have an overwhelming majority, they would not have started rushing

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.520
[Amit Varma]: through all of these things, as you pointed out with the UCC, no doubt next, that they

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.280
[Amit Varma]: are doing this out of conviction, not out of a cynical vote grabbing exercise, which

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.000
[Guest]: is how do you react to all of this?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.600
[Guest]: No, I think that's, that's broadly true. Because, you know, the conception one of the

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:23.160
[Guest]: core ideas of Hindutva, and this goes right back to Savarkar and his pamphlet, Hindutva,

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:31.880
[Guest]: you know, 1923, where he says that, you know, India is the homeland, the Pitrabhumi and

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:36.320
[Guest]: the Punyabhumi of all Hindus in the world, right. So it is akin to a certain conception

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.680
[Guest]: of say, like Israel being the homeland of all Jews in the world, right. So, and that

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.640
[Guest]: in effect is driving some of these things, right, which which goes back to the argument,

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.600
[Guest]: and we'll come to it a little bit more, because some of these arguments were also made in

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.720
[Guest]: the constituent assembly debates, when citizenship provisions were actually being discussed,

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:58.880
[Guest]: which is that, why should India not be the place where Hindus should naturally come to,

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.200
[Guest]: right, especially since Pakistan has been created for Muslims, you know, where are the

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.840
[Guest]: Hindus of the subcontinent going to go, you know, there is that kind of a rhetoric. But

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:13.560
[Guest]: as you said, that automatically gives a privileged position to Hindus in this country, which

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:18.080
[Guest]: goes against every tenet of the Indian constitution with its provisions for equality, the notion

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.380
[Guest]: of secularism, which is weaved into the constitution in so many different dimensions. And that

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:29.520
[Guest]: is a clearly an issue in play here, right. The second thing about, you know, why the

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.680
[Guest]: BJP is kind of doing this, at some level, I think, yes, it is definitely a question

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:42.560
[Guest]: of them saying, listen, we now have an electoral majority for the second successive time, we've

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:48.600
[Guest]: come back in much greater numbers, our program has been affirmed and validated. And we are

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.920
[Guest]: doing just what we promised in our manifesto, right. And the Home Minister, when he tabled

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.320
[Guest]: this bill, as well as Article 370, repealing, you know, the nullification of that those

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:02.240
[Guest]: provisions in Parliament said this, that this is there in our manifesto. But the reality

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:08.760
[Guest]: is that the manifesto of a party, even with 300 odd seats, is not the same thing as the

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:14.160
[Guest]: Constitution of India. And that is a fundamental distinction that I think it is incumbent upon

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:21.120
[Guest]: all of us to recognize, and for citizens to say that elected majority government is not

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.640
[Guest]: at liberty to overturn fundamental provisions of the Constitution, there have been sort

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:30.120
[Guest]: of constitutional doctrines of basic structure, etc, to that effect, which affirm this principle.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:34.200
[Guest]: And I think this argument that listen, we have a majority, we won this election on the

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:39.520
[Guest]: basis of this manifesto. Hence, you know, we should be allowed to go ahead and do this

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:45.400
[Guest]: simply does not cut eyes. A constitutional democracy works on the principle that you

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.080
[Guest]: on the one hand have democracy, which is about aggregation of majority preferences. But on

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.120
[Guest]: the other hand, you also have the grid of constitutionalism imposed on it, which says

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:59.320
[Guest]: that there is an extent beyond which the majoritarian principle cannot operate. And I think we are

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.320
[Guest]: pretty much at the cusp of that kind of a moment.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.200
[Amit Varma]: And it's sort of interesting, like one of the books you recommended I read was citizenship

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:12.600
[Amit Varma]: and its discontents by Neeraja Gopal Jial outstanding book. And she also gave a recent

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.960
[Amit Varma]: interview to the New Yorker, where she spoke about one of the things that is interesting

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:23.280
[Amit Varma]: about this whole majoritarian project in India, and which distinguishes it from other majoritarian

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:28.800
[Amit Varma]: projects is that the people we are projecting as the other are not recent immigrants, not

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.920
[Amit Varma]: recent migrants. It's like, you know, you might have, for example, movements in Europe

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:39.040
[Amit Varma]: against recent Muslim immigrants from Syria or wherever. And you might have movements

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.240
[Amit Varma]: in the US about relatively recent, like over the last century immigration from Latin America

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:49.240
[Amit Varma]: and so on. But what is happening in India is that Muslims have been a part of India

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:54.360
[Amit Varma]: for centuries, right? The other thing that is happening is a othering of people who are

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.320
[Amit Varma]: fundamentally part of the society. Ironically, a fact even Savarkar recognized, because if

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:05.040
[Amit Varma]: one sees his rhetoric till about 1910, it's actually very inclusive. And he sees Hindus

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.440
[Amit Varma]: and Muslims fighting together. And what really, you know, the two recent biographies on him

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.280
[Amit Varma]: elaborate upon is that the sort of brutal torture he was put through at Kalapani, even

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.600
[Amit Varma]: though the jailer was English, the people administrating the tortures were Muslims.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:23.400
[Amit Varma]: And that seems to have awakened and radicalized him as far as Muslims were concerned. And

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:29.080
[Amit Varma]: therefore, in Hindutva, it's all about Muslims are the other and India belongs to the Hindus.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:36.320
[Amit Varma]: The other fundamental clash of concepts here is that what Savarkar seems to be intimating

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.040
[Amit Varma]: is that citizenship is something that comes from descent. So if you are a Hindu, you are

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:47.240
[Amit Varma]: a citizen, whereas the other notion of citizenship is citizenship by birth. If you are born in

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.880
[Amit Varma]: India, you're a citizen. And the interesting thing is that the notion of citizenship by

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:57.360
[Amit Varma]: birth was dominant both in the British conception of citizenship from, you know, which was an

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.080
[Amit Varma]: intellectual influence on our leaders, and in the conception of citizenship by our freedom

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:08.400
[Amit Varma]: founders, including, you know, Motilal Nehru's document of 1928, and so on and so forth.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:14.520
[Amit Varma]: And but there has always been this sort of growing clash between these two, where constitutionally,

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:21.800
[Amit Varma]: we gave supreme status to citizenship by birth, therefore avoiding these sort of divisions

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.880
[Amit Varma]: that did not actually make sense for a multicultural and diverse society as ours. But you know,

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.800
[Amit Varma]: while that is in the constitution in the political notion of citizenship, citizenship by descent

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.120
[Amit Varma]: has kind of made a comeback.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.080
[Guest]: Yes, you make a number of very important points. But before we start unpacking them, let me

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.280
[Guest]: also make a plug for Professor Neeraja Gopal Jayal's book, which I think is by a long chalk,

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:48.840
[Guest]: the best history that we have of citizenship, I would recommend to every listener of yours

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.480
[Guest]: to get a copy of the book and read it for themselves. I think it will clarify a lot

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.480
[Guest]: of things about our current...

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.840
[Guest]: It's a marvellous book, it will be linked from the show notes on SceneUnseen.in.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:02.320
[Guest]: Thank you. Now, to go back to your question. Now, let's take Savarkar as a starting point,

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.080
[Guest]: for instance. Now, again, I don't want to get too much into the personal biography and,

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.760
[Guest]: you know, trajectory of Savarkar and why he kind of, you know, gets to this thing. But

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.840
[Guest]: at a very simple level, someone like Savarkar, you know, there is an irony that someone who

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:22.720
[Guest]: speaks so much about Indianness, about Hindutva Bhartiyata, as his descendants call it today,

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:28.640
[Guest]: are actually captive to the classic European notions of what should be a nation state.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.760
[Guest]: Yeah, so in a sense, that's the irony of fundamental irony at the heart of the Hindutva project

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:40.080
[Guest]: that a project which apparently is about Indianness, authenticity, etc, is actually mimicking and

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:47.240
[Guest]: imitating and borrowing directly from a very straightforward 19th century European conception

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:53.440
[Guest]: of a nation state, which is defined by one ethnic category or race, as Savarkar himself

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:59.520
[Guest]: called it, defined by one language, which is unified in that sense, right? I mean, now,

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.320
[Guest]: that is the context in which someone like Savarkar says that, listen, if every state

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.840
[Guest]: has to be, every nation state has to be defined by one ethnos, then in the Indian context,

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.720
[Guest]: of course, the Hindus, right? And others, as long as they are able to accept that culturally

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.440
[Guest]: they are Hindu, you know, they can do what they want, that satisfies our requirement

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:24.680
[Guest]: of having constituted that kind of an ethnic national state, right? Which in turn leads

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:31.240
[Guest]: to this kind of conception of citizenship by descent, which you talked about, right?

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:36.880
[Guest]: Now, scholars of citizenship and political theorists broadly make a distinction between

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:45.200
[Guest]: two notions of citizenship, right? So, one is called use soli, use the Latin term J-U-S,

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:52.520
[Guest]: use soli and use sanguinis. Use soli refers to citizenship by birth, which is the place

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.360
[Guest]: where you're born decides whether you're a citizen or not. And use sanguinis is about

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:04.920
[Guest]: blood, kinship, and descent being the main principles through which you do, right? Now,

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:10.800
[Guest]: politically, we tend to think of Republican France as the sort of example of the first

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:17.480
[Guest]: conception of use soli based citizenship. You may also think of it as civic citizenship.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:22.200
[Guest]: On the other hand, Germany is supposed to be the exemplar of use sanguinis, citizenship

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.640
[Guest]: by descent, and you can think of as ethnic citizenship, right? So, civic and ethnic,

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:33.000
[Guest]: use soli, use sanguinis. Now, in practice, of course, all these regimes tend to interpenetrate

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.200
[Guest]: to a greater or lesser extent in various kinds of regimes. Now, as far as India was concerned,

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:46.080
[Guest]: the reality for most Indians during the colonial period was that they had to cling to some

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.680
[Guest]: conception of citizenship to begin with, because you're subjects effectively of the British

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:58.240
[Guest]: Empire, right? So, all the debates about getting citizenship of the British Empire, etc, were

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.880
[Guest]: fundamentally had to reckon with the reality of your subjecthood of your being colonized

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.480
[Guest]: by an alien power, right? And in the context of the British Empire itself, there are at

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:11.560
[Guest]: least two levels at which discussions of citizenship used to happen. So, one was what you might

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:17.040
[Guest]: think of as imperial citizenship, rights of people who are dispersed across imperial territories.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:22.640
[Guest]: And let us face it, the British Empire was also a great engine of migration, forced migrations,

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.960
[Guest]: indentured labor, slavery, plantations of various kinds, right? So, there are people

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.840
[Guest]: from India who are implanted in various parts of the British Empire, what rights did they

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.920
[Guest]: have? Someone like Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi actually came to the fore talking about the

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.800
[Guest]: rights of Indians in South Africa, who are working there, who had gone there and so on,

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:45.320
[Guest]: right? So, there is that kind of notion of what is, what rights do we have as citizens,

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.600
[Guest]: so to speak, of the British Empire? And then there is a question of what rights do you

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:53.080
[Guest]: have within the context of the British Raj in India itself, which is kind of more narrowly

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.720
[Guest]: defined, right? And much of the struggle was about this. And then the key sort of strand

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:04.560
[Guest]: of liberal thought in India from, say, the mid to late 19th century effectively attempted

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:10.120
[Guest]: to struggle for equality of citizenship, both within the British Empire, but also for grant

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.080
[Guest]: of citizenship rights within the context of British India itself, right? And that was

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.960
[Guest]: a project which was at the heart of this thing. And then one of the problems with the whole

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:24.600
[Guest]: liberal model of nationalism of the late 19th century variant was precisely that that was

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.480
[Guest]: never forthcoming on the part of the British. Even when they gave you certain rights, it

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.840
[Guest]: was always hedged in with qualifications of property, education, class status. So, in

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:39.120
[Guest]: that sense, right? And, and I'm always reminded of this, you know, wonderful book by Niro

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.720
[Guest]: Chaudhary, whom you can think of as a last exemplar of that great anglophone liberalism

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:49.360
[Guest]: of Bengal Renaissance, so to speak, right? The self-defined Renaissance. In his extraordinary

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:54.600
[Guest]: book published in 1951, soon after India's independence, called An Autobiography of an

00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:00.560
[Guest]: Unknown Indian, Niro Chaudhary has a dedication to the book, which made the book totally notorious,

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:06.200
[Guest]: and in fact, made him an object of hate. But Nirodh Babu remained, you know, an anglophone

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:11.200
[Guest]: to the very end, he even migrated to England later on. And the dedication of the book says

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:17.440
[Guest]: this, right? It says the book is dedicated to the memory of the British Empire in India,

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:23.000
[Guest]: which conferred subjecthood upon us, but withheld citizenship, right? It's very interesting.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.520
[Guest]: Conferred subjecthood, but withheld citizenship. And then he goes on to say, to which yet every

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:35.000
[Guest]: one of us throughout this challenge, and he says, quotes, civis Britannicus sum, which

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:42.000
[Guest]: is to say that I am a British, Britain. Yeah, that I am British. Civis Romanus sum was the

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.680
[Guest]: sort of phrase used by Kikeru to talk about rights of Romans everywhere, right? So, what

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.880
[Guest]: someone like Niro Chaudhary is trying to say is that we asked citizenship of the British

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:57.280
[Guest]: Empire, but it was withheld to us. But nevertheless, his admiration for that empire remains undimmed,

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:03.240
[Guest]: right? And if this is the sort of, you know, the kind of backward glance by one of the

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.960
[Guest]: last surviving members of what you may think of the classic Indian liberalism of the late

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:12.720
[Guest]: 19th century variant, you can see why the project failed, simply because you just could

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.120
[Guest]: not get it on those terms from the British Empire. And of course, you know, there are

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:23.240
[Guest]: discussions about what should constitute citizenship in independent India. And there you mentioned

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:29.560
[Guest]: about the Motilal Nehru report of 1928, which is an interesting document because it is something

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.880
[Guest]: like a proto constitution for an independent India or an attempt at, you know, devising

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.200
[Guest]: some kind of constitution for independent India. And the Motilal Nehru report already

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:46.080
[Guest]: enshrines use solely or citizenship by birth as the principle of granting citizenship in

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.920
[Guest]: independent India, right? And it says that anyone born or naturalized within the territorial

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:56.320
[Guest]: limits of India, or who's the child of a father born or naturalized in the territorial limits

00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:02.060
[Guest]: of India would be given Indian citizenship. Now, please note, if your father was born,

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.240
[Guest]: you could be right. So, it's still a restricted form of citizenship. There is a gendered quality

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:12.520
[Guest]: to that notion of citizenship, which is enshrined in the 1928 Motilal Nehru report. But nevertheless,

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:18.600
[Guest]: the fundamental principle is of citizenship by birth. It is of a civic form of citizenship

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.160
[Guest]: rather than an ethnic form of citizenship. And that is what then comes to the fore in

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.120
[Guest]: the debates in the Constituent Assembly, when which are happening against the backdrop of

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.120
[Guest]: partition itself.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:32.080
[Amit Varma]: So, we'll come to that later, just to sort of, you know, get back to the sort of the

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:37.660
[Amit Varma]: strivings within India for citizenship of the British Empire. You know, it kind of strikes

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:41.440
[Amit Varma]: me that, you know, when you look back in the late 19th century, you have these very fine

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:47.020
[Amit Varma]: liberals like Naoroji, Gokhale, Ranadey Agarkar and so on, whom we now collectively call as

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:51.840
[Amit Varma]: moderates because they were moderate in their method, so to say. And in fact, I had an episode

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.040
[Amit Varma]: on Indian conservatism with Jerry Rao, where he claimed that they were conservatives, because

00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:03.560
[Amit Varma]: their methods were not radical. And it's sort of interesting to put yourself in their shoes,

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:08.360
[Amit Varma]: where India doesn't exist. You know, today, we sort of look at the past through a frame

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.040
[Amit Varma]: of the present and all the things we take for granted that there is this, you know,

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.240
[Amit Varma]: there is a state of India, which we are part of, and we are all patriots, and we love the

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:19.620
[Amit Varma]: country and whatever, and we are proud citizens of India. So why would you want to be a second

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:24.600
[Amit Varma]: class citizen somewhere else? But there you have all of these very fine liberals, Naoroji

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:30.320
[Amit Varma]: in words, who are basically part of the British Empire, the conception of India is something

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:36.720
[Amit Varma]: that is still nebulous and hasn't really solidified and taken shape. And within those restraints,

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:42.300
[Amit Varma]: they are essentially trying for, you know, and even the term citizenship isn't so defined.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:47.800
[Amit Varma]: If you just look at the landscape of the 19th century, you know, that there aren't so many

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.400
[Amit Varma]: like women don't vote, you know, you still don't have universal suffrage. And the conception

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.960
[Amit Varma]: of a citizen is very different from what it should be now. And I'm sort of struck by,

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, how one can look back at all of them and find them ineffectual and say, right,

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.920
[Amit Varma]: hey, what were they asking for? What were their methods, you know, with the benefit

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.680
[Amit Varma]: of hindsight, but it's still an interesting battle to take Indians forward. And there's

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:15.480
[Amit Varma]: a very interesting quote here by Lala Lajpat Rai, which I got from Nirja's book, of course,

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:20.040
[Amit Varma]: where he talks about the increasing group of elite Indians in the early 20th century

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:25.760
[Amit Varma]: who are asking for more rights or more like quasi citizenships, where he says, quote,

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.400
[Amit Varma]: the fact is that the British government in India is on the horns of a dilemma. They want

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.120
[Amit Varma]: the Indians to believe that they are the equal subjects of the king. But when the former

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.480
[Amit Varma]: claim their rights as such, they behave as if they have neither the power nor the desire

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.280
[Amit Varma]: to secure the same for them. Perhaps it is not so much the fault of the government of

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:47.960
[Amit Varma]: India as those statesmen who have to reconcile their professions and principles of liberalism

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:53.360
[Amit Varma]: with their policy of subjection. And then he goes on to say, the desire, the ambition

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.720
[Amit Varma]: and the necessity of claiming the rights of British citizenship is no longer confined

00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.800
[Amit Varma]: to educated Indians, but is permeating through the uneducated classes and even the masses,

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.800
[Amit Varma]: stop quote. And of course, he uses the phrase British citizenship here and a lot of the

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:11.520
[Amit Varma]: sort of quote unquote, citizenship and the rights or entitlements that are given to Indians

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.080
[Amit Varma]: at that time are on the basis of property and education confined to a very small number

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:22.120
[Amit Varma]: of people. How does the conception of citizenship within India grow from this, from just a few

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:27.760
[Amit Varma]: people with property and education having any rights at all, to something all encompassing

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.880
[Guest]: as it did when we gained independence? Well, I think there are two aspects to it,

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:37.680
[Guest]: which are worth recalling. First, as far as the, the older, you know, discourse about

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.280
[Guest]: citizenship in the context of British Empire is concerned, I think the point of reference

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:47.520
[Guest]: for that, especially from the turn of the 20th century really is about the fact that

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:53.320
[Guest]: there are certain parts of the British Empire, which are given various forms of recognition

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:58.800
[Guest]: in terms of their autonomy, their rights, which are known as the white dominions, which

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:05.520
[Guest]: are Canada, Australia, South Africa, right? And these areas are recognized and there is

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:10.880
[Guest]: a very clear racial divide within the British Empire itself, which is running through, right?

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.920
[Guest]: You know, the, the great African American thinker W.E.B. Du Bois, you know, talked about

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:19.280
[Guest]: the color line girdling the globe, right? And it definitely girdled the British Empire.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.520
[Guest]: And there was that racial divide, which said that, you know, certain dominions and certain

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:31.040
[Guest]: colonies had greater rights within the British Empire could aspire to various forms of citizenship,

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:35.480
[Guest]: because they were officially even known as the white dominions.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:39.760
[Amit Varma]: And you know, even among the white people, there were divisions in the sense that, like

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:44.880
[Amit Varma]: one fascinating fact I read was that if you were a French person naturalized in New Zealand,

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.600
[Amit Varma]: you'd be a British citizen as long as you were within the dominion of New Zealand. But

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.920
[Amit Varma]: if you went back to England, you would be considered a Frenchman and a foreigner.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.640
[Guest]: That's right. The second thing which was done was that the white dominions were given power

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:02.880
[Guest]: to regulate immigration to their territories. You know, Lala Rajpathrai's observations here,

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.400
[Guest]: as well as many of his other writings from that period, also have to be understood against

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.960
[Guest]: the backdrop of the infamous Komagata Maru incident, right, which in some ways crystallized

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:15.120
[Guest]: many of these problems, which is that when a ship bearing a number of Indians attempts

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.240
[Guest]: to berth in Canada, it is turned away. Right. And so, in a sense, the white dominions were

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:25.000
[Guest]: allowed to restrict people from other parts of the British Empire from entering their

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.440
[Guest]: own territory, right, which suggested that you had a distinct second class status, even

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:36.720
[Guest]: within the British Empire. And that was primarily a racial sort of divide, which was there,

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:41.200
[Guest]: even though it was not termed in so many ways, and but it was absolutely evident to all the

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.440
[Guest]: people that you named, that this was the game in play. And that is what they were trying

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.240
[Guest]: to rise against. And as I said, even Gandhi was trying to do similar things in the context

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.240
[Guest]: of South Africa.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And Gandhi, of course, moved from a position of working with the empire to eventually

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.740
[Amit Varma]: rebelling against the empire and working with the empire wasn't working out. Just to sort

00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:00.960
[Amit Varma]: of briefly tell my listeners what Komagata Maru was, there was a ship called Komagata

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.960
[Amit Varma]: Maru, which took a bunch of Indians, I think around 200 to Canada, and the Canadian government

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.880
[Amit Varma]: refused them entry, it I think just took one Indian doctor, four people and 20 people who

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.360
[Amit Varma]: were Canadians coming back to Canada. But the remaining Indians were sent back on the

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:18.360
[Amit Varma]: ship. And when the ship embarked on what was then Bombay, the British government refused

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.400
[Amit Varma]: to let them disembark because they said that, you know, you guys committed sedition by leaving

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.040
[Amit Varma]: us and going to Canada. And there were clashes and I think 19 people or something like that

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:31.000
[Amit Varma]: actually died in those clashes. That's kind of where we are now we get to independence,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.680
[Amit Varma]: okay, and you have the and as Gopal points out in her book, quote, at midnight on August

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:42.960
[Amit Varma]: 15 1947, all the erstwhile Indian subjects of King George VI did not, as we might expect,

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:49.000
[Amit Varma]: automatically become citizens of the new nation. Stop quote, you know, there is still a process

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.180
[Amit Varma]: left the country is independent, but the people are not citizens, there is still a process

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:59.080
[Amit Varma]: left that process is being debated in the Constituent Assembly. Guidelines are being

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:04.040
[Amit Varma]: discussed by the framers of the Constitution and how we should look at citizenship. Tell

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.240
[Amit Varma]: me a bit about that period and what are the fault lines in those debates?

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:12.000
[Guest]: Well, I think the starting point is to recognize what historians of partition have been telling

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.560
[Guest]: us for some time now, which is that partition was not an event, it was actually a process.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:24.160
[Guest]: It did not just happen at the stroke of midnight. It was something whose practicalities both

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.480
[Guest]: India and Pakistan had to grapple with for several years, perhaps even decades into the

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:34.680
[Guest]: future about the kinds of, you know, actual realistic administrative and various kinds

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:39.240
[Guest]: of legal measures that had to be put in place. And that, of course, goes to the heart of

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:45.520
[Guest]: the problem, which is about the movement of, you know, maybe 10 plus million people across

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.320
[Guest]: the borders of the newly created states of India and Pakistan. And again, it was not

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.160
[Guest]: something just concentrated in time, but was spread out. And how do we deal with this,

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:59.360
[Guest]: right? So it is in that context that really the Constituent Assembly has to consider the

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:04.480
[Guest]: citizenship sort of provisions, right? And it is recognized that once the Constitution

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:09.040
[Guest]: comes into play, and there is a government, the parliament will legislate and create a

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.720
[Guest]: citizenship act. But in the meantime, the Constituent Assembly, which is also doubling

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:18.280
[Guest]: up as the legislature, had to take certain kinds of put certain kinds of principles both

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.960
[Guest]: to guide future legislation, but also to cater for some immediate problems of what is happening.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:28.040
[Guest]: So those debates are an interesting mixture. And they're fascinating precisely because,

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:32.800
[Guest]: you know, they are discussing principles, even while the tragedy of partition is unfolding.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.960
[Guest]: So you have you cannot leave the practicalities of it aside. You cannot leave the emotions

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.760
[Guest]: that are in play aside, right? So it's a very, very interesting thing. And in the last set

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:48.200
[Guest]: of discussions on the citizenship provisions of the Constitution, Jawaharlal Nehru actually

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.160
[Guest]: says that, you know, this is perhaps the one part of the Constitution that we have discussed

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:59.320
[Guest]: the longest, right? Because it was very contentious. Because it mixed both issues of principle,

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.760
[Guest]: issues of practical importance, issues of imminent practical importance, right? So that

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:08.760
[Guest]: is the thing. Now, there are broadly three provisions of the Constitution, which were,

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:13.760
[Guest]: you know, dealing with these questions, Articles 5, 6, and 7. So let me just quickly summarize

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.560
[Guest]: them. I don't want to get too much into detail, and then talk a little bit about how those

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:22.200
[Guest]: debates themselves played out, right? So Article 5 effectively says that at the time of the

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:26.720
[Guest]: commencement of this Constitution, 26 January 1950, as it turned out, anyone who's born

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:31.560
[Guest]: in India, or either of whose parents are born in India, right, please note, we've improved

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:35.960
[Guest]: from the Motilal Nehru report of 1928. So either of whose parents are born in India,

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:41.320
[Guest]: or who has been resident in India for five years continuously, will be a citizen of India,

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:47.240
[Guest]: right? So that is the main provision of Article 5. Article 6 talks about provisions for those

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:54.880
[Guest]: who migrated to India from Pakistan. And it says that if this person, her parents, or

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.720
[Guest]: grandparents were born in undivided India, which is British India, and they talked about

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:05.040
[Guest]: the Government of India Act 1935 defining those boundaries. And if that person migrated

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:11.520
[Guest]: before July 1948, when the sort of the migration controls were brought into place, and were

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.280
[Guest]: residents since then, or if they came between July 1948, and the time that the Constitution

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.960
[Guest]: comes into force, then they would be registered as citizens, right? So you have a provision

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:26.720
[Guest]: for people who are coming in from Pakistan to India. And even though no religions are

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.200
[Guest]: named, it is understood that a majority of those people are going to be Hindus and Sikhs,

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:35.920
[Guest]: right? That that is the demographic of that particular movement. Now, Article 7, which

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:42.000
[Guest]: in some ways, is important, because it superseded some the, you know, Articles 5 and 6, it says

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:51.200
[Guest]: that anyone who migrates from India to Pakistan, after March 1 of March 1947, right, which

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.520
[Guest]: is even before partition happens, shall not be deemed a citizen of India, right? This

00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:00.200
[Guest]: is a very strong provision, which is brought in to say that anyone who left India on or

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:06.280
[Guest]: after first March 1947, will not be seen as a citizen of India, even if they want to come

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:15.000
[Guest]: back to India, right? And if they return to India, they will have to return with a permit,

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.120
[Guest]: which is issued by the Indian High Commission in Pakistan. And then there would be a path

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.600
[Guest]: for citizenship to them, which is that they will be seen as people who are effectively

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:29.440
[Guest]: coming after July 1948, as per the provisions of Article 6, right? So, in a sense, you say,

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:35.000
[Guest]: first of all, that anyone who left India for Pakistan, which is effectively Muslims, after

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.360
[Guest]: March 1947, shall not be regarded as citizens. And that if they want to come back, as a lot

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:43.200
[Guest]: of people were coming back, because their family is their property, etc, might have

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:47.000
[Guest]: been in India, then they would have to get this special permit and have to get into this

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.080
[Guest]: track for coming into citizenship, right? So, between these three things, Article 5,

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:56.400
[Guest]: which is overall provisions, 6, which is about people coming into India, 7, which is about

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:01.400
[Guest]: people going from India to Pakistan who might want to come back, right? These three provisions

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:06.960
[Guest]: together were at the heart of the Constituent Assembly's discussions on citizenship itself.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.880
[Guest]: And these were very contentious provisions, right? I mean, let me just sort of give you

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.760
[Guest]: an example of the kinds of arguments which are made. I mean, there are very fascinating

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.700
[Guest]: discussions, you know, the one of the great things is that the Constituent Assembly debates

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:21.160
[Guest]: are now very easily accessible online. So, I'd encourage, you know, viewers to go back

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:25.000
[Guest]: and read this because it gives you a sense of how, you know, thoughtful but at the same

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.360
[Guest]: time impassioned those discussions were and in some ways, you know, a refreshing contrast

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:33.040
[Amit Varma]: to what happens in our discussions. In fact, a sign of how impassioned they were

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:38.000
[Amit Varma]: is that, you know, Jaspath Roy Kapoor called Article 7 the obnoxious clause. And a lot

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.120
[Amit Varma]: of the literature refers to it as obnoxious clause, quote unquote, because you know, that's

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.040
[Guest]: how strongly they felt. Yeah, yeah. So, let me just, you know, and

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:50.520
[Guest]: then just worth pointing out that Jaspath Roy was a senior congressman from UP. And

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:58.160
[Guest]: many of the people who criticized these provisions, or, you know, said that, listen, why use Soli

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.880
[Guest]: based principle, or why should, you know, people coming back from Pakistan be given

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.120
[Guest]: an opportunity even to become citizens at all, when they've actually first left for

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:12.600
[Guest]: Pakistan, right, were not necessarily people who are from the Hindu right, so to speak,

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.240
[Guest]: they were from the Congress Party as well, because there was a lot of feeling at that

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:20.480
[Guest]: point of time, that the country had been divided. Right. And it kind of goes back to some of

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.680
[Guest]: the arguments which were made by the Home Minister when he was tabling, right, in the

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:28.400
[Guest]: discussion, he sort of at one point burst out saying, it is a Congress Party which divided

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.320
[Guest]: the country on the basis of religion, you know, actually, the Congress Party accepted

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:36.400
[Guest]: partition, but they never accepted the two nation theory, right. And even if you look

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:43.280
[Guest]: at the partition plan of 1947, which was unveiled, it is very clear that the Congress Party does

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:49.280
[Guest]: not at any point say that we accept the division of India on the basis of the two nation theory,

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:54.360
[Guest]: what the Congress Party signs up to effectively is this. The partition plan says that the

00:45:54.360 --> 00:46:00.360
[Guest]: legislatures of the state provinces of Punjab and Bengal will vote on whether the provinces

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:06.320
[Guest]: should stay united or should be separated. The legislature of Sindh will vote on whether

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:11.360
[Guest]: it should go to India or Pakistan. There would be a referendum in the Northwest frontier

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:16.600
[Guest]: province, because even though it is a Muslim majority province and contiguous to Punjab,

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:22.360
[Guest]: Dhaka and Sindh was ruled by a Congress government in the select district of Assam, which we

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:26.720
[Guest]: will come to again later, you know, there was be a referendum, right. So, effectively,

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:32.440
[Guest]: what the Congress Party signed up to was to say that if democratic tests could be used

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:38.880
[Guest]: to establish that a significant minority of the country wanted to secede, and if it was

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.440
[Guest]: geographically possible, then we will not stand in the way of such a session, right.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:48.040
[Guest]: That was what the Congress Party signed up to. They never accepted that the two nation

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:53.320
[Guest]: theory was the principle on which we are accepting the partition. Yeah. So, they accepted partition,

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:57.240
[Guest]: but never the two nation theory. So, in that sense, the Honorable Home Minister was totally

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:02.880
[Guest]: wrong when he said that in the floor of the house. But these points were, however, you

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.880
[Guest]: know, reflected the debates on the CAD, right. So, for instance, there is Bhargav Das, you

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:11.840
[Guest]: know, who says that he I have only two wishes as far as the citizenship law is concerned,

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:17.760
[Guest]: that every person who comes from Pakistan as a refugee should have no problem becoming

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:24.380
[Guest]: a citizen in India. But whoever left for Pakistan in order to become a citizen of Pakistan before

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:28.160
[Guest]: independence should never get citizenship in India, right. So, there's a sense that

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:32.640
[Guest]: isn't those who have left, why should they ever be given the opportunity to come back,

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:37.200
[Guest]: right? Even before Jaspath Roy talked about the obnoxious clause, etc, you know, there's

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:42.640
[Guest]: another very interesting person called Dr. P S Deshmukh, who later became the Union Agriculture

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:47.920
[Guest]: Minister in 1952, senior Congress leader, who said that, you know, forget about Article

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.880
[Guest]: 7. In fact, I think Article 5 itself, which defines a basic, you know, you solely principle,

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:59.120
[Guest]: he says should be changed to state that every person who's a Hindu or a Sikh, and is not

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.680
[Guest]: the citizen of any other state should automatically be eligible for the citizenship of India,

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:07.360
[Guest]: right? So, he wanted to bring use sanguineous or dissent into the story, because the argument

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.960
[Guest]: which he makes, and he says this in the Constituent Assembly, he says, if the Muslims want an

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:15.640
[Guest]: exclusive place for themselves called Pakistan, why should not Hindus and Sikhs have India

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:19.760
[Guest]: as their home? Yeah, that is the classic use sanguineous argument. The interesting thing

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.080
[Guest]: is that even as Dr. Deshmukh is saying these things, he says that I know this will militate

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:27.360
[Guest]: against our conception of India as a secular state. He says that also in the Constituent

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:32.240
[Guest]: Assembly debates, right? So, there is a recognition that the use sanguineous principle will cut

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:37.880
[Guest]: against the broader vision of the thing. But there is a sense of anger that the country

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.560
[Guest]: has been partitioned, and those who left should simply not have the option ever to come back,

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:45.040
[Amit Varma]: right? In fact, there's a reflection of that anger and the same thing you're saying and

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:49.720
[Amit Varma]: what Jaspath Roy himself said, where, you know, talking about Article 7, the obnoxious

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:54.840
[Amit Varma]: clause, he says, quote, it's a serious matter of principle. Once a person has migrated to

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:59.200
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan and transferred his loyalty from India to Pakistan, his migration is complete,

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.520
[Amit Varma]: he has definitely made up his mind at that time to kick this country and let it go to

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:06.320
[Amit Varma]: its own fate. And he went away to the newly created Pakistan where he would put in his

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:10.520
[Amit Varma]: best efforts to make it a free, progressive and prosperous state, stop quote, where the

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:15.000
[Amit Varma]: implication is, and this is also a kind of other implication is that listen, you left

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000
[Amit Varma]: and therefore you're a traitor. And now you can't come back. And, you know, we can think

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.560
[Amit Varma]: of it in harder terms right now. But at that point in time, everything is very fluid, people

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.560
[Amit Varma]: are going back and forth. And that date is something arbitrary, which many citizens don't

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:31.600
[Amit Varma]: even realize that there is a date like that. Or, you know, I mean, I read about a guy who

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.200
[Amit Varma]: went on a business trip to Pakistan before the date and came back after the date. And

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.880
[Guest]: he was stuck in a case for years because

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:40.520
[Guest]: Yeah, and that that precisely was the kind of divide in the Constituent Assembly, right?

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:44.880
[Guest]: So those who wanted to tighten the provisions of Article 7 by saying, listen, there should

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:49.920
[Guest]: just be no avenue for those who left for Pakistan to come back to India, effectively arguing

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.440
[Guest]: that this was purely a matter of voluntary choice, right? As he says, he has kicked this

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.320
[Guest]: country, he has gone, he has made his choice. Why the hell should such people be allowed

00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.200
[Guest]: ever to come back, right? And if they come back, they will be fifth columnists in this

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:04.560
[Guest]: country and so on. And again, what is striking about not just these debates, but many other

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:08.080
[Guest]: debates in the Constituent Assembly is this language of saying, you know, people have

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:12.080
[Guest]: to be loyal to the country and so on. Even Jawaharlal Nehru says it, though to Jawaharlal

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.000
[Guest]: Nehru's credit, he says that Pakistanis should be loyal to Pakistan, Indians should be loyal

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.400
[Guest]: to India, right? But there is the sense that how are we going to create this national unity

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.480
[Guest]: and so on, which is an underlying sense of many of these kinds of choices.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.760
[Amit Varma]: So, isn't then the case, the fault line state exists today in the discourse, which have

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:31.320
[Amit Varma]: led to these protests, which has led to the CAA, were also present then. It's just that

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:36.160
[Amit Varma]: the people who sort of, you know, like even those who are arguing that, you know, that

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:40.160
[Amit Varma]: India should be the home for all Hindus and whatever and just as Pakistan is a home for

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:45.120
[Amit Varma]: Muslims is in a sense, arguing a version of the two nation theory. So, did the fault lines

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:50.000
[Amit Varma]: also then exist then except that then they were on the losing side and the broader secular

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.360
[Amit Varma]: inclusive vision won out, and now they're not on the losing side anymore?

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:57.760
[Guest]: Well, I think that is the important thing to remember, that it was not at all inevitable

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.680
[Guest]: that the secular broader vision, pluralistic vision should have won out in the Constituent

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.440
[Guest]: Assembly, right? Which is why I was trying to emphasize that the people who are making

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:10.240
[Guest]: these points are senior congressmen. They are not people from the Hindu Mahasabha who

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.960
[Amit Varma]: are a small minority whom you can just relegate.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.960
[Amit Varma]: Exactly. So, it's a dominant stream of thinking.

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:17.680
[Guest]: There is a very important stream and that is why these were the most contentious provisions

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:23.000
[Guest]: as Jawaharlal Nehru observed, right? But the point is that how were they able to persuade

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:29.320
[Guest]: and win over this thing, right? First by affirming that, listen, we are for a secular state and

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:36.160
[Guest]: that the principle of citizenship by birth is the one that best captures this. Yes, we

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:40.440
[Guest]: recognize that those who left Pakistan, you know, they should not have an, you know, Indian

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:44.560
[Guest]: citizenship should not be so cheap that people can just come back and ask for it. But at

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:48.320
[Guest]: the same time, we cannot tell them that, listen, you cannot come back. And the argument which

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.760
[Guest]: was made was to say that this is not always a matter of choice, that a lot of people left

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:57.200
[Guest]: under compulsion, under duress. When you have communal violence of that kind erupting, a

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:01.600
[Guest]: lot of people thought it might be safer to move to areas where there are Muslim majorities

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:05.880
[Guest]: and vice versa, right? It is in that context that a lot of people left. When things settle

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.760
[Guest]: down, people want to come back to their home and hearth. You know, there is also an underlying

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:15.600
[Guest]: economic dimension to the story. A lot of the people who opposed the provisions of Article

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.720
[Guest]: 7 said that, you know, Muslims should never be allowed to come back from Pakistan to India

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:23.120
[Guest]: and claim citizenship. We're also concerned that those who are coming back will also claim

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:27.600
[Guest]: property. The property they left behind, basically. Yeah, which has been taken over by the Evacuee

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.920
[Guest]: Property Organization, right? I mean, and they said that, listen, if they claim back

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:36.000
[Guest]: property, how are we going to resettle refugees who come to India, right? And Jawaharlal Nehru

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.040
[Guest]: and the Congress Party, Patel and others made it very clear, saying that, listen, it is

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:45.280
[Guest]: the responsibility of an Indian state to rehabilitate those people. It is not the owners should

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:50.320
[Guest]: not be left upon people, communities and the property which, you know, they have at their

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:55.340
[Guest]: disposal. The second thing which they said very clearly and Nehru says this in his sort

00:52:55.340 --> 00:53:00.480
[Guest]: of important intervention in these debates is that to argue against Article 7 is to argue

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:05.960
[Guest]: for discrimination, is to argue for unfairness. It is exactly the language that the protesters

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:10.640
[Guest]: of today are using to say that if you want to exclude some people from provisions of

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.280
[Guest]: citizenship, yeah, it's not to say that everybody has a freedom, right? It's not like what the

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.000
[Guest]: Prime Minister said, or should every Pakistani be eligible for Indian citizenship? That's

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:23.700
[Guest]: an absurd claim. The issue is that do we put in place laws, which will systematically exclude

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:30.540
[Guest]: some people from claiming citizenship in that context. And it was a very hard won victory.

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:35.160
[Guest]: It was not an easy thing for even the Congress Party to carry the Constituent Assembly and

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:39.320
[Guest]: for these provisions to come into play, which is why I think it is all the more important

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:43.200
[Guest]: that people should actually go back and read those debates to understand that the Congress

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:47.520
[Guest]: Party and the Indian nationalists of the time, not just the Congress Party, the mood in the

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:52.840
[Guest]: Constituent Assembly was never to accept the two nation theory. There was a lot of, you

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.760
[Guest]: know, heat around these debates around the anger of the fact that the country had been

00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:01.680
[Guest]: divided. But at the same time, that anger was not allowed to subsume fundamental principles

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:05.560
[Guest]: of equity, pluralism and secularism on the basis of which the Constitution was being

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:06.560
[Amit Varma]: drawn.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:10.760
[Amit Varma]: And as an aside, you know, there is a semantic reflection of the tenor of those debates and

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:14.320
[Amit Varma]: which might even have relevance to what is going on today, in the sense that even though

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.800
[Amit Varma]: these words did not make it to the actual articles, two of the words used a lot in the

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:24.080
[Amit Varma]: debates were refugee and migrant. Whereas refugee, it was sort of used in a sense of

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:29.920
[Amit Varma]: Hindus, you know, fleeing Pakistan and East Pakistan as it were, and therefore poor guys,

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.880
[Amit Varma]: they have no choice, they've been forced out. So you know, we will welcome them. But with

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:39.200
[Amit Varma]: migrants, it was a reference to the people, article seven dealt with that Muslims who

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.200
[Amit Varma]: might have gone to Pakistan or been there on that date, and then they decide to come

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:48.600
[Amit Varma]: here, you know, and, but you know, spoken of as migrants, not refugees, because, you

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:52.720
[Amit Varma]: know, there's a choice involved, and what is the intent, and we must ascertain the intent.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:57.440
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, you have then commission sitting in over the intent and not listening to what

00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:04.360
[Amit Varma]: the stated intent is, but, you know, rejecting a lot of Muslim applications for citizenship

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:09.120
[Amit Varma]: on that basis. And so, you know, it does seem to me that sort of, okay, you know, the secular

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:14.080
[Amit Varma]: liberal way of thinking sort of won the argument back then. But I think the argument that a

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:18.600
[Amit Varma]: lot of people are sort of making now, is that a permanent victory? Why should that still

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:22.520
[Amit Varma]: be the case? And that is, of course, something I lament, because I think both you and I are

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:27.560
[Amit Varma]: of the persuasion that we should not discriminate. And, you know, we value secularism, but the

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.240
[Amit Varma]: point and I think I brought this up in my in our episode on Kashmir as well, the point

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:35.800
[Amit Varma]: that Dindayal Upadhyay made about the constitution were not in so many words, but the idea being

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:40.160
[Amit Varma]: that look, it was a constitution imposed by a liberal elite on a country which did not

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:44.000
[Amit Varma]: share those values. So, you know, it's one thing to say, like you said, at the start

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.120
[Amit Varma]: of the episode, that just because they have won an election doesn't mean that they can

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:51.400
[Amit Varma]: overturn the constitution. But their argument would be that look, the constitution number

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:56.000
[Amit Varma]: one is not a permanent thing. Number two, the constitution has been desecrated constantly

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.560
[Amit Varma]: through the decades by Nehru and Indira Gandhi repeatedly. They themselves desecrated the

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:06.360
[Amit Varma]: constitution to the extent that as early as 1953, Ambedkar said that, you know, if I could,

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.840
[Amit Varma]: I would burn the constitution, you know, a document that he authored, he felt so strongly

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:13.640
[Amit Varma]: about what was being done to it. So, the argument of the people today would be that look, look

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:18.000
[Amit Varma]: at what Nehru and Indira did to the constitution to the extent that, for example, the preamble

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.800
[Amit Varma]: that people are reading out in all these protest marches is basically not the Ambedkar preamble,

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:27.800
[Amit Varma]: it's the Indira preamble. And they would argue that, no, now, you know, we are the people,

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:33.360
[Amit Varma]: we have proven that in the electoral system that we have, why does that have less significance

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.680
[Amit Varma]: than the constitution? That is a question that could be posed, not something that I

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:40.320
[Amit Varma]: am posing or I agree with. But that's one way of looking at it.

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:44.720
[Guest]: No, the constitution was never intended to be a dead document. It was supposed to be

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:48.720
[Guest]: a living document, right? Which is why the provisions for amendment were made and fairly

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:51.800
[Guest]: liberal provisions for amendment, right? And if you, the threshold for amendment is not

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:55.960
[Guest]: that high for many parts of the Indian constitution, which is why the Indian constitution is not

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:59.960
[Guest]: just one of the longest documents of its kind in the world, but it's possibly one of the

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:06.320
[Guest]: most amended such documents as well. So, there is no, you know, point in saying that, listen,

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:09.120
[Guest]: this thing and in fact, the first set of amendments were bought in by Jawaharlal Nehru.

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.960
[Amit Varma]: Exactly. I mean, we know that back history. In fact, there's an old cartoon about how

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:16.520
[Guest]: the constitution is not a book, but a periodical. Yeah. And in fact, Nehru himself says in one

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.400
[Guest]: of his letters saying that, you know, the biggest problem with this constitution is

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.400
[Guest]: that, you know, we try to plug everything into it and it constantly keeps coming in

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:27.480
[Guest]: the way of what we are trying to do in any context. So, that is, I think it is taken.

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:35.400
[Guest]: But the issue is whether a set of laws made by a parliament, which is elected on democratic

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:43.120
[Guest]: principles can effectively overturn the fundamental underlying principles of the constitution.

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:47.920
[Guest]: And there, there is a doctrine which goes back to the famous Kesavananda Bharati judgment

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:55.080
[Guest]: of the 1970s, which talks about there being a basic structure to the Indian constitution

00:57:55.080 --> 00:58:02.200
[Guest]: and that no legislation which undermines that basic structure will be deemed as consonant

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:06.360
[Guest]: with the constitution. It has been affirmed many times that the provisions of equality

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:13.000
[Guest]: of secularism are basic structures, features of the Indian constitution in as much as the

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:19.720
[Guest]: current amendment to the Citizenship Act undercuts and goes against those principles, it is to

00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:24.120
[Guest]: my mind unconstitutional. I'm not a constitutional lawyer. We can discuss these things. I'm sure

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:29.400
[Guest]: the courts will hear it at some point. But the reality is that that is what the argument

00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:33.120
[Guest]: is about. The argument is not to say that, listen, the constitution is frozen in time

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:37.200
[Amit Varma]: or that it's a document which cannot be changed. But, you know, here's the point. So, and I'll

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:41.880
[Amit Varma]: link to a talk that my friend Shruti Rajgopalan gave on YouTube about this, about the constitution

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:46.040
[Amit Varma]: changing over the years, is that every time Nehru did something unconstitutional or Indira

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:49.520
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi did something unconstitutional, and this happened many times, and it was ruled

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:54.400
[Amit Varma]: to be unconstitutional, they changed the constitution. So, my hypothetical question to you, therefore,

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:58.920
[Amit Varma]: is that if this lot, which almost has the numbers to change the constitution and might

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:04.160
[Amit Varma]: well, God forbid, have those numbers at some point, if they change the constitution, then

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.680
[Amit Varma]: are we to sit back and say, oh, okay, this is a constitution. Now it's no longer unconstitutional.

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:12.200
[Guest]: No, but that is precisely what the Keshavananda Bharati judgment and the basic structure doctrine

00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:16.080
[Guest]: prevents you from doing, which is to say that there are limits to what the parliament can

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.680
[Guest]: do by way of amending the constitution. There are some aspects of the constitution that

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:24.900
[Guest]: you cannot tamper with, right. So, there is no straightforward constitutionally correct

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:31.640
[Guest]: option to wholesale overturn the fundamental nature of the constitution itself. If you

00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:35.800
[Guest]: want to do it properly, then effectively, you should ask people, campaign on the basis

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.560
[Guest]: of saying, listen, we are going to have a second constituent assembly, please put that

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:42.440
[Guest]: on the manifesto, go to the people. If you win a victory, then perhaps you can convene

00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:45.600
[Guest]: a second constitutional assembly and design the constitution that you want, and then go

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:47.880
[Guest]: back to the people and get it approved with them in a referendum.

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:51.320
[Amit Varma]: Who knows, they might actually do this, and then you will be back here and we'll be discussing

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:54.040
[Guest]: another process. I am happy to sort of, you know, contemplate

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:59.880
[Guest]: a possibility like that, in a sense, I think, but that is the only way to change the constitution.

00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:04.480
[Guest]: Every other way of doing this stuff by stealth, you know, as it was done in the context of

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:11.520
[Guest]: the 370, you know, by sort of an indirect skullduggery type action, cannot stand scrutiny

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:16.320
[Guest]: if the courts take a proper view of what is happening. I am not a constitutional lawyer,

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:21.080
[Guest]: but this much I know that if you want a fundamentally different constitution, then you need a second

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:24.680
[Guest]: constituent assembly of some kind. You need a different constitutional regime in order

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:28.320
[Guest]: to bring in a new constitution. You cannot just marginally keep tinkering and getting

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.400
[Guest]: to that point. Now, we may well get to that point if the

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:36.320
[Guest]: courts do not stand up for the constitution, which they are there to interpret and protect.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.760
[Amit Varma]: And you know, an irony that strikes me here, and this is an aside before we sort of get

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:45.940
[Amit Varma]: back to the main body of our discussion. An irony that strikes me here is that many supporters

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:50.280
[Amit Varma]: of this government sort of identify as conservatives and they call themselves conservative, but

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.480
[Amit Varma]: it kind of strikes me that what this particular government is doing, and I mean this in an

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.520
[Amit Varma]: entirely negative sense, what this government is doing is not conservative at all, is both

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:04.000
[Amit Varma]: revolutionary and radical. They are one, not only going against the grain of the constitution

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.040
[Amit Varma]: itself, as you pointed out, which is an extremely radical act, but you could argue that they

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:14.760
[Amit Varma]: are also going against the grain of Indian society, which by its nature is assimilative

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.200
[Amit Varma]: and tolerant. And this is sort of a debate that I wrestle with in my own mind. You know,

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:24.840
[Amit Varma]: I brought it up in my recent episode with JP Narayan, where he objected to my classification

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:30.360
[Amit Varma]: of India as an illiberal society. And you know, one can obviously point out many illiberal

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:35.640
[Amit Varma]: things about our society, especially the misogyny and the way women are treated, for example.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:41.720
[Amit Varma]: But equally, in one way, we are a liberal society in the sense that we assimilate influences

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:47.200
[Amit Varma]: from all over so well, including the fact that, you know, Mr. Shah's name is of Persian

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.880
[Amit Varma]: origin, the elegant churidar kurtas of Mr. Modi are obviously of Islamic origin, and

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:58.600
[Amit Varma]: we assimilate it all beautifully and make our own. So to now to do this sort of othering

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.520
[Amit Varma]: that the government is doing is a radical act, not a conservative act.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:08.120
[Guest]: No, so two points, right? First about the conservatism and radicalism. There is a famous

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:12.160
[Guest]: article by the American political scientist Samuel Huntington called conservatism as a

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.320
[Guest]: positional ideology, where he says that conservatism as a doctrine never has positive content,

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.240
[Guest]: it is not defined by certain tenets in the way that liberalism is. It is about saying

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:26.200
[Guest]: whether you are for change or you're against change effectively, right. And he says that,

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.400
[Guest]: you know, you can be a conservative in various contexts. And in that sense, he says that,

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.800
[Guest]: you know, those who are trying to uphold liberal values in America today against the onslaught

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:38.960
[Guest]: of communism in the Cold War are effectively conservatives, right. And in that context,

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:42.520
[Guest]: I'd say that all those people who are coming out in the streets are conservatives in as

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.360
[Guest]: much as they want to conserve the existing institutions and the framework of this country.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:52.480
[Guest]: I think it is a very straightforwardly, you know, a conservative impulse, but on the assumption

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:57.160
[Guest]: that what we are trying to conserve on what we are trying to preserve, protect, you know,

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.400
[Amit Varma]: which is what our president is supposed to do under the oath of office, right? Protect

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:06.320
[Amit Varma]: and defend. The Huntington point is also made by Hayek in his famous essay, why I am a conservative

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.200
[Amit Varma]: where he says that, you know, they don't have ends, they're just a means, you know, they

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.200
[Guest]: just want to get everything to be the same. The second point which you made, which is

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:17.920
[Guest]: about, you know, what is the nature of society, what is Indian identity, and so on. That is

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:23.720
[Guest]: always a point of political, intellectual, ideological contestation, right? I think

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:29.960
[Guest]: every society tells certain stories of its own past for itself. Every society rests on

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:35.440
[Guest]: certain commonly accepted fictions, if I may put it that way, right? We all imagine certain

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.560
[Guest]: pasts for ourselves. But what is important about these imaginations is which of these

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:44.720
[Guest]: models do we find persuasive, right? It is in that sense that these acts of imagination

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.840
[Guest]: fundamentally are about political, they are about being able to persuade others to buy

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:55.200
[Guest]: into that vision. What the Indian National Congress and the leadership that got us independence,

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.960
[Guest]: brought the constitution into this country did, was to persuade that there was one reading

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:07.000
[Guest]: of Indian history, which was, which made for a better future for India than anything else.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.200
[Guest]: And that was precisely this thing, right? This assimilative. Jawaharlal Nehru has this

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:16.360
[Guest]: famous metaphor in the discovery of India, where he says that India is an ancient palimpsest.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.760
[Guest]: Line upon line has been written, but what has gone before has never been totally erased,

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:24.920
[Guest]: right? So in a sense, you know, there used to be a slogan when we were growing up in

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:29.520
[Guest]: schools, right? It used to be plastered on the wall saying unity and diversity. But actually,

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.080
[Guest]: the Indian National Congress and the Indian National Movement and the Constituent Assembly's

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:38.320
[Guest]: vision was not so much unity in diversity, but as reminding us that we are diverse in

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:44.240
[Guest]: our unities, that this is a country of extraordinary diversity, of all kinds, diversity at a scale

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:51.040
[Guest]: which is unprecedented in world history. And if we want to make a new nation state with

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.920
[Guest]: a new constitutional regime, we will have to accept and accommodate those diversities,

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.960
[Guest]: which is why the constitution of India is a constitution which is not, even though it

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:05.040
[Guest]: talks about a unitary state, it is not necessarily federal and it's this thing, but has a federal

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:09.280
[Guest]: complexion, has federal provisions. But its underlying vision is to say that, listen,

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.720
[Guest]: there are various forms of differences and asymmetries that we have to accommodate within

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.640
[Guest]: this country, which is why then you say that, listen, let's have personal laws, you know,

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.420
[Guest]: it's always better to have a uniform civil code. But the history of India, the moment

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:26.320
[Guest]: of partition suggested that it is better to let some identities gain confidence before

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.400
[Guest]: they themselves decide that they want to come forward and do things, right? So it was an

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:34.440
[Guest]: acceptance. It was a messy compromise. But that is what India at the time of independence

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:42.480
[Guest]: was. You know, you had to do that. And it was a working model. It was a work in progress.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:48.440
[Guest]: Its success depends on its ability to persuade Indian citizens that this understanding of

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:54.040
[Guest]: our past is better. What the Hindutva project is about is an alternative understanding of

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:59.480
[Guest]: Indian past, which again, true to form, is effectively borrowed from colonial forms of

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:05.040
[Guest]: knowledge. It was the British who first taught us to think about our past as being divided

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:09.680
[Guest]: into a Hindu period, into a dark ages when the Muslims ruled over India. And then of

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:14.400
[Guest]: course, the onset of enlightenment with British blessings of liberty and prosperity into this

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:20.240
[Guest]: country, right? So that the tripartite periodization, which is at the heart of their thing, right?

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.880
[Guest]: So every time they say, oh, we are writing 600 year old wrongs, right? This was a period

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.720
[Guest]: of Muslim domination, we were enslaved, we were colonized, right? You are effectively

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:34.640
[Guest]: buying into that particular vision of India, which funnily enough, is a British vision,

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:39.800
[Guest]: right? So the greatest advocates of Bharatiyata in this country are the greatest prisoners

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.800
[Guest]: to the British Orientalist project, and its categories of knowledge and thought that they

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:47.800
[Guest]: left behind. So in a sense, if there is anybody who deserves decolonization, it is them.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.400
[Amit Varma]: And I think I had an episode with Manu Pillai where we also kind of discuss this, how many

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:57.360
[Amit Varma]: of our own nations of what our civilization was like, have come from the narratives built

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:00.640
[Amit Varma]: by the British, because the British go to this new place, and they have to explain it

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:05.200
[Amit Varma]: to themselves. And typically, the early narratives of this will always be simplistic and will

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.760
[Amit Varma]: always contain binaries. And those narratives and narratives that we have somehow embraced

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:15.560
[Amit Varma]: unquestioningly and which now sort of dominate the discourse. And like you pointed out, you

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:20.360
[Amit Varma]: know, what is sort of remarkable about India as an experiment is obviously the incredible

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:25.600
[Amit Varma]: diversity, which is why the typical mistake that say Savarkar and the RSS made of looking

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.080
[Amit Varma]: at it more in European terms, where it's one nation, one state, and all of that is such

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.400
[Amit Varma]: a mistake. That's a fantasy. I mean, it's just...

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:38.440
[Guest]: And it's a fantasy and we can discuss it because the logic of those arguments is what is creating

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:43.120
[Guest]: the kind of turmoil that you see in the Northeast today, which is just one sort of place, example

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.040
[Guest]: of how tightly woven some of these diversities and this tapestry is, right? I mean, in a

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.580
[Guest]: sense, you pull at one thread, a lot of it can unravel. And you know, that's the kind

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:54.280
[Guest]: of thing. And of course, you know, Gandhi as always was an outlier to everything, right?

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:58.220
[Guest]: I mean, the originality of the man was precisely in that, you know, Gandhi has this wonderful

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:03.720
[Guest]: line where he says, happy is the country that has no history. He says, forget about history.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.520
[Guest]: And in fact, it was Gandhi who carried the day even after his death in the Constituent

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:12.920
[Guest]: Assembly because people invoked him to say that Gandhiji said that every Muslim who has

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:16.440
[Guest]: gone to Pakistan should be free to come back to India and he should come back to India.

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:19.640
[Guest]: That was his vision. And that is what I think we tried to do. But obviously, within the

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:23.920
[Guest]: limitations of what the practicalities of the Constitution is. So, it was not a perfect

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:28.160
[Guest]: set of arrangements between Articles 5, 6 and 7. You know, a perfect arrangement would

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.520
[Guest]: have said that, you know, listen, why even have, you know, declared that those who left

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.120
[Guest]: for Pakistan are not citizens, right? I mean, you should in a sense have open-ended. But

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.600
[Guest]: the reality, as I said, was that the Constituent Assembly was grappling with this issue, not

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:44.080
[Guest]: just as a matter of principle, but were imminent practical exigencies, which impinged upon

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.960
[Guest]: the lives of millions and which excited the passions of millions more. So, you had to

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:53.000
[Guest]: strike those messy compromises. And frankly, that is what politics is about. This desire

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.280
[Guest]: for neat mathematical solutions of the kind that seems to animate our current politics,

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.120
[Guest]: right? That, you know, everything has to be sort of systematized. There is one nation,

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.560
[Guest]: there is one nationalism, there is one this thing. It's something that fundamentally goes

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.720
[Guest]: against the grain of the way that the Constituent Assembly thought about these things.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.720
[Amit Varma]: Right. So, we have the framing of the Constitution. Our side, so to say, wins the debate. We have

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:21.520
[Amit Varma]: Article 5, 6, 7, you know, the citizenship by birth takes preeminence here. And it's

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:26.640
[Amit Varma]: an inclusive vision of citizenship, despite the sort of exclusive arguments made. But

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.080
[Amit Varma]: that's not, you know, the Constitution isn't like Upendra Bakshi, for example, makes a

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:37.020
[Amit Varma]: distinction between, quote, the constitutional state, the normative and aspirational framework

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:41.680
[Amit Varma]: enunciating the desired social order, and the political state as framework of competition

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.440
[Amit Varma]: for political power, or even the struggle to capture the constitutional state, stop

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.840
[Amit Varma]: code. So, you have the constitutional state, which is sort of that ideal, principled vision,

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:56.640
[Amit Varma]: which is laid down by the framers of the Constitution. But in actual politics, you have those contestations

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.440
[Amit Varma]: aren't settled in our actual politics, they are still going on. And in a sense, you could

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:05.080
[Amit Varma]: say that, you know, they have now come to the fore in a very big way. And those arguments

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:11.120
[Amit Varma]: are sort of taking place again. And I'd say that there's also perhaps a necessity to have

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.440
[Amit Varma]: those arguments again and win that argument again, as hopefully we are doing with all

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.760
[Amit Varma]: our protests and civil disobedience, rather than just hug back to the Constitution and

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.000
[Amit Varma]: say we won that argument. And the thing which I don't think we did win that argument, it's

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
[Guest]: still happening.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.600
[Guest]: No, no. And I think Professor Bakshi's point also is to say that, in a sense, whatever

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:36.240
[Guest]: might be the sort of, you know, text of the Constitution, or laws on statute books, the

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:40.180
[Guest]: reality is that in administrative practice, there were still various kinds of discrimination

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:43.860
[Guest]: which were practiced, which is what he's referring to, right. And then we have historians like

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:48.480
[Guest]: Vazira Zamindar, who have pointed out that how even after all of these things happened,

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.880
[Guest]: you know, Muslims who are seeking to return, come back to India, were because of a range

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:56.720
[Guest]: of administrative measures effectively kind of made it very difficult for them to come

01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:00.360
[Guest]: back and claim their properties. And the evacuate property story is a very long one. I don't

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:04.280
[Guest]: want to get into that digression. But, you know, this is absolutely true, in a sense,

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:09.360
[Guest]: you know, there's no argument is ever won just by, you know, getting a law passed. So

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:14.400
[Guest]: to that extent, that was true. What I also buy the argument is that in some ways, it

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:20.000
[Guest]: is important for this kind of discussion to happen. I'm not so sure whether we have won

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.440
[Guest]: as yet, or whether we will even win. I mean, a lot will depend on what the government does

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.440
[Guest]: and what the courts do.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:30.120
[Amit Varma]: And a lot also depends on how we define victory. For example, even if a majority of the people

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:35.000
[Amit Varma]: agree with us, the first pass the post system means that, you know, it's just very messy.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.240
[Guest]: And that's the system we've signed up to. So we also have to play by the rules of the

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:42.200
[Guest]: game, right? So I mean, so I think that is, but your point, I think, is important, which

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:48.120
[Guest]: is to say that the mere fact of the discussion, and the fact that we are sitting here and

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.680
[Guest]: talking about these things, as are so many, you know, millions of people out there, itself

01:11:52.680 --> 01:12:00.280
[Guest]: is a good sign, because, you know, constitutional sort of, you know, values need to be embraced

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.320
[Guest]: by a society at large. That was Ambedkar's fundamental point, right? He said, you can

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:08.520
[Guest]: write any book that you want. But if the society at large and its normative values are going

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:12.640
[Guest]: to be totally untouched by those things, then it's just a top dressing on a totally different

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:18.240
[Guest]: kind of soil, right? So that that is the point, right? So constitutional cultures have to

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.720
[Guest]: be created. And in other contexts, they are created by these kinds of movements, they

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:26.560
[Guest]: are created by these kinds of struggles. We've seen it happening in country after country,

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:31.560
[Guest]: you know, notions of rights of freedom are never closed, they continue to expand, you

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:35.840
[Guest]: know, even in the context of Indian citizenship, and the way that people thought about it,

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.040
[Guest]: there were various kinds of exclusion, there were gendered exclusions, there were, you

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:43.720
[Guest]: know, exclusions around religion, etc, in practice, which had to be overcome, right?

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:47.360
[Guest]: So and then even, as we discussed in the context of Assam, there's an entirely different set

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:51.000
[Guest]: of history and practical politics that you have to deal with. So there is no taking away

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.400
[Guest]: from any of that. In fact, my point is precisely the opposite, which is that the beauty of

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.880
[Guest]: the Constituent Assembly debates and this thing is precisely their willingness to balance

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:06.720
[Guest]: principle and pragmatic immediate choices, and then to say how best to be sort of cope

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.200
[Amit Varma]: with these things. It is not an exercise in abstraction. And it's actually very fascinating

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.480
[Amit Varma]: for that reason, that it is, you know, that they are framing that constitution which embodies

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:20.960
[Amit Varma]: those principles at the same time as there is violence and bloodshed on the streets.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:24.400
[Amit Varma]: And they have to figure out a sort of way to make it work. You know, you mentioned gendered

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:29.760
[Amit Varma]: inclusions and, you know, something that really has no relevance to the subject on hand, particularly

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:35.440
[Amit Varma]: today, but is an interesting sidelight and is also an illustration of our inherent sexism

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:41.760
[Amit Varma]: as a society is, you know, in December 1949, the Abducted Persons Recovery and Restoration

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:46.240
[Amit Varma]: Act. And, you know, to read about all the things that happened today is, you know, just

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:50.520
[Amit Varma]: shocks me even from this distance, where basically the Abducted Persons Recovery and Restoration

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:56.480
[Amit Varma]: Act laid down a date after which all mixed unions that is unions between men and women

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:01.240
[Amit Varma]: belonging to different religions would be treated as cases where women had been abducted

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:06.080
[Amit Varma]: and forcibly married or converted. Now, the thing is that obviously, a lot of women on

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.080
[Amit Varma]: both sides of the border were abducted and these things did happen. But the assumption

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:15.320
[Amit Varma]: was that all marriages would be treated as cases of abduction if they were of mixed religions,

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:20.760
[Amit Varma]: as if, you know, inter-religious marriage was otherwise impossible or so unusual. And

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:27.360
[Amit Varma]: this led to dual paradigm of recovery and restoration, where these women would be recovered

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.640
[Amit Varma]: and then restored to, you know, whichever side they were, quote unquote, again, abducted

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:38.280
[Amit Varma]: from. And, you know, Gopal in her book makes this exceptional point that, quote, this entailed

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:43.120
[Amit Varma]: not only determining the religion at birth of a woman, almost as if it were a biological

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:49.040
[Amit Varma]: characteristic, but also her biological status as a woman whose body had been violated, impregnated

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:54.920
[Amit Varma]: and otherwise defiled by union with a male of another religious community. A powerful

01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:00.480
[Amit Varma]: patriarchal nationalism informed such interpretations of the abducted woman's body as a metaphor

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:06.200
[Amit Varma]: for national purity, honor and morality. And now the critical line, women's citizenship

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:11.960
[Amit Varma]: was thus produced by three concentric circles, the citizenship of a father or husband, religious

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:17.680
[Amit Varma]: identity and on the basis of the first two, her imputed national identity, stop quote.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.920
[Amit Varma]: And it kind of strikes me how, you know, in every debate that we have about different

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:27.000
[Amit Varma]: crisis in India, there is a deeper crisis when it comes to women within that domain.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.720
[Amit Varma]: For example, we can talk about the crisis in agriculture, but it's actually far worse

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.560
[Amit Varma]: for women in agriculture, and so on across different domains. And it strikes me that

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:41.320
[Amit Varma]: in this whole citizenship debate, we are still talking about the citizenship of men and women

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.640
[Guest]: are just treated as property in a sense.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:47.080
[Guest]: Oh, yeah. I mean, I think patriarchy is kind of turtles all the way down when it comes

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:52.400
[Guest]: to this thing. And, you know, in fact, apart from Professor Dayal's book, I'd recommend

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.920
[Guest]: Amrita Pritam's story, Pinjar, which was also later on made into a very powerful movie,

01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:00.120
[Guest]: which actually captures what could be the kinds of relationships in which people were

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:05.280
[Guest]: caught up. And why this, you know, assumption to make the woman's body the sort of symbol

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.960
[Guest]: of national purity, etc, proved to be so wrong. And as a parenthesis, I will say that, you

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:13.640
[Guest]: know, a similar kind of problem also played out in the context of Bangladesh, after its

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:19.960
[Guest]: liberation when women who are victims of sexual violence and the children that they conceived,

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.240
[Guest]: as a result, were deprived of citizenship of the state, because, you know, they were

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:26.880
[Guest]: not so the women were hailed as Biranganas, as you know, sort of this thing. So on the

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.960
[Guest]: one hand, you hail the women. On the other hand, you deny citizenship to the children

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:31.960
[Guest]: that they had to conceive.

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.960
[Guest]: Because they were quote unquote, defiled in some way.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:39.960
[Guest]: Exactly, right. So, so, so we are very much and this is not just India, but, you know,

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:44.640
[Guest]: well beyond the subcontinent, these kinds of practices do play out.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:50.440
[Amit Varma]: Right. So after the Constitution sort of frames Article 5, 6, 7, you then have the Citizenship

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Act of 1955. What is this about? What is the impetus? And where are we now when this act

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.040
[Guest]: happens?

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.680
[Guest]: So, as I said, the Constituent Assembly had always envisioned that the parliament would

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:05.800
[Guest]: legislate on citizenship, and that the provisions that they were debating were to set some fundamental

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:10.280
[Guest]: principles in place, and to cater for the immediate problems that were considering.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:15.240
[Guest]: And the reality is that by the time the government of India catered with the so called immediate,

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:19.360
[Guest]: so many years had to pass, because as I said, partition was a process, it is not an event.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.760
[Guest]: And so it's only 1955 that the Citizenship Act comes in. And that is the act which is

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.760
[Guest]: today being amended. So it's important to sort of, you know, note that timeline 1955.

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:33.280
[Amit Varma]: So the Citizenship Amendment Bill or CAB, as we call it today, amends the Citizenship

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.280
[Amit Varma]: Act.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:39.200
[Guest]: Act of 1955. Right. The Citizenship Act is actually it's fairly straightforward. It basically

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:45.760
[Guest]: says that an illegal migrant in India is a foreigner who has come to India without a

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:51.600
[Guest]: proper visa, or who has overstayed in India after the expiry of whatever permit he had

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:56.480
[Guest]: to come to India, he or she. Yeah. So that is one kind of very clear thing, you know,

01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:00.920
[Guest]: which which takes away from all these things about, you know, whether you're a refugee,

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:05.920
[Guest]: persecution, minority, you know, which religion, etc. Right. As far as citizenship itself is

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:10.280
[Guest]: concerned, it created certain clear categories under which citizenship could be given. And

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:13.840
[Guest]: again, we don't need to sort of get into it, the text of the bill is available on the web

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:18.320
[Guest]: for our listeners to go back and read if they're interested. But broadly speaking, it talked

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:23.760
[Guest]: about birth, parentage or descent, registration, naturalization, the kinds of things that are

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:28.960
[Guest]: quite normal, it outlined the various ways in which a person could become a citizen of

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:34.680
[Guest]: India, right. And those are the fundamental bedrock provisions on which citizenship in

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:40.640
[Guest]: this country and its regime has been constituted. Assam constitutes the sort of, you know, different

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:45.420
[Guest]: and exceptional zone to this, we'll come to Assam in a bit. But I think it's at this point

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:53.920
[Guest]: of time worth talking a little bit about how the sort of use solely conception, which is

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:59.040
[Guest]: kind of at least upheld in principle, in this thing, and more or less embodied in the context

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:08.000
[Guest]: of the 55 bill is already undergoing certain kinds of changes when the BJP government under

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:14.120
[Guest]: Prime Minister Vajpayee was in place, right. So in 2003, there is a amendment to the Citizenship

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:21.000
[Guest]: Act, which is also bought in, which actually makes an interesting point, it says it modifies

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.600
[Guest]: the clause for citizenship by birth, which allows you know, either you're born in India

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:32.600
[Guest]: or either of your parents are India, to exclude persons born in India, one of whose parents

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.060
[Guest]: was an illegal migrant at the time of their birth. So even if you're born of India to

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:42.760
[Guest]: one parent who is an Indian, it would not suffice, right. Now, this might seem like

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:46.360
[Guest]: saying, oh, listen, but we are talking about both parents actually being migrants, right.

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:51.760
[Guest]: But what it brings in is a certain conception that there are illegal migrants are foreign

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:58.360
[Guest]: to the body politic. And in that sense, their offspring cannot claim, right. And this is

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:02.280
[Guest]: one particular amendment to the act, which is bought in. And again, it was bought in

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:07.320
[Guest]: broadly in the context of these concerns about illegal immigration, etc, which are driving

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:12.520
[Guest]: our current debates as well. There was one more thing which was kind of important, which

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.920
[Guest]: is the amendment to the citizenship rules of 1956, right, like, you know, the rules

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:23.160
[Guest]: are framed after an act is passed. Now, the 2004 amendment to the citizenship rules, delegated

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:28.840
[Guest]: powers to grant citizenships, yeah, particularly to district collectors in the two states of

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:34.280
[Guest]: Rajasthan, Gujarat, both of which have borders with Pakistan. And here it explicitly catered

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:40.240
[Guest]: for minority Hindus with Pakistani citizenship, who had migrated to India more than five years

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:45.680
[Guest]: back, right. So, in a sense, it said that for those people, they could have various

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.880
[Guest]: other kinds. So, a special category has already been created already on the basis of religion.

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:55.360
[Guest]: But this is not done in the act. It is done through the provision of the rules. And it

01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.040
[Guest]: is done for very specific locality where there is an issue of this thing. And at that point

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:07.360
[Guest]: of time, this was also targeted at maybe around 11 or 12,000 people who Hindus who had come

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:12.640
[Guest]: to Pakistan after the, you know, violence that racked all of the subcontinent post the

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:17.000
[Guest]: demolition of the Babri Masjid, right. There were violence in Bangladesh, there was violence

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.560
[Guest]: in Pakistan as well. And these were Hindu communities which are abstract from Pakistan.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.880
[Guest]: And so, in a sense, you could argue that, listen, this is an administrative measure.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:29.360
[Guest]: But nevertheless, as you know, we discussed earlier, administrative measures can sort

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:34.000
[Guest]: of seep into and bring in various other kinds of principles into the laws that we're talking

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:40.280
[Guest]: about, right. So, that was already being done. Now, when the BJP government under Prime Minister

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:48.000
[Guest]: Modi comes back to power, it effectively issues a couple of notifications in 2015 and 2016,

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.520
[Guest]: which presage the constitutional amendment bill that they sort of introduced and passed

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:57.320
[Guest]: in this parliament, right. And which says that it exempts Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists,

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:02.600
[Guest]: Jains, Parsis, Christians from the three countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, from

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.760
[Guest]: the provisions of the Passport Act, etc., in a sense that they would not be treated

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:09.840
[Guest]: as sort of illegal migrants, right. And it said specifically that these were if they

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:14.200
[Guest]: were compelled to seek shelter in India due to religious persecution, or the fear of religious

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:18.360
[Guest]: persecution, right. So, this provision, even before it is enshrined in law, is already

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:24.360
[Guest]: being enshrined in the administrative kind of, you know, sort of procedures for this.

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:28.600
[Guest]: And it said that for these people, because they should not be treated as illegal migrants,

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:32.880
[Guest]: they can actually apply for a five year visa, which will then allow them to stay on, etc.

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:37.920
[Guest]: And then you have the citizenship amendment bill, which takes the same provisions, embodies

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:44.760
[Guest]: it in law and says that the cutoff date is 2014. And everyone who has come before that,

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:49.640
[Guest]: who belongs to these communities, which is to say everyone minus Muslims, from these

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:57.000
[Guest]: states, which is Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, which are Muslim majority states, those alone

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:03.600
[Guest]: can be eligible for a separate track for gaining citizenship. So, Muslims or refugees from

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.560
[Guest]: other countries like Sri Lanka, etc., are not eligible to get citizenship under this

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:13.320
[Guest]: thing, which is a clearly discriminatory. So, all of this is just by way of saying that

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:19.960
[Guest]: things have been already changing. But the change which has now been brought in, is being

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:24.600
[Guest]: brought in explicitly as a law. The second point I want to make in this connection is

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:34.760
[Guest]: that there have been videos circulated on WhatsApp by the IT cell and its functionaries,

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:39.880
[Guest]: which are quoting Dr. Manmohan Singh as leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha in 2003,

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:45.560
[Guest]: speaking at the time when the citizenship amendment of 2003 was being debated, as saying

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:51.640
[Guest]: that we should have other pathways for or more liberal ways of granting citizenship

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:57.040
[Guest]: to people who are fleeing religious persecution. Now, that is true. But what he was making

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:01.880
[Guest]: a case was for people who are fleeing a religious persecution, not to say that certain communities

01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:06.400
[Guest]: alone should be favored or not. In fact, it is very interesting. And people seem to have

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:12.440
[Guest]: forgotten that in 2012, the then secretary, General Secretary of the Communist Party of

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:17.440
[Guest]: India Marxist, Prakash Karat, actually wrote a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:23.200
[Guest]: reminding him precisely of the speech and saying that we should bring in more liberal

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:30.360
[Guest]: provisions for grant of citizenship for people who are fleeing persecution from Bangladesh.

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:34.480
[Guest]: And he was, of course, talking about the Hindu minorities who might have come and they were

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:38.880
[Guest]: an important, so to speak, vote bank for the CPM in Bengal as well, right? I mean, so in

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:44.280
[Guest]: a sense, everyone plays these games. But the reality is that neither Dr. Singh nor Prakash

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:50.880
[Guest]: Karat were talking about bringing in such a patently discriminatory legislation. And

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:55.280
[Guest]: I think that should be stated very clearly. I think this country definitely needs a good

01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:00.680
[Guest]: law for refugees. We have not acceded to the UN conventions on these issues. We definitely

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:06.520
[Guest]: need good legislation. But what we don't need is a legislation, which under the garb of

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:12.760
[Guest]: providing citizenship to refugees, effectively is discriminatory and alongside the NRC creates

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.240
[Guest]: a situation where a lot of people can be consigned to a legal limbo.

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:22.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and it strikes me as two observations here. One is really a question and the observation

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:27.420
[Amit Varma]: one is that how for a lot of this you essentially need to read between the lines and you need

01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:32.320
[Amit Varma]: to consider context. For example, like you said, a refugee law is a great thing. If you

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:37.840
[Amit Varma]: just look at the CAB in an abstract that persecuted minorities from all of these countries will

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:42.760
[Amit Varma]: be given blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It sounds great until you realize what they left out.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:46.200
[Amit Varma]: And this omission is a deliberate one because time after time you will actually see for

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:49.840
[Amit Varma]: example Amit Shah on his speeches and there are many videos of this, where he will talk

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.360
[Amit Varma]: about all the different religions which would be accepted, you know, when they are refugees.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:26:00.120
[Amit Varma]: And the one notable omission always, of course, is Muslims and you know, combined with the

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:04.800
[Amit Varma]: NRC, when you get that sort of context, you realize what's going on. The other point that

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:09.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm slightly puzzled about and completely ignorant of really is that, look, I get it

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:15.920
[Amit Varma]: that parties do things, parties have these tropes which go on over years, if not decades.

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:20.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you spoke about how Karate is, for example, thinking of his vote bank when

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:25.640
[Amit Varma]: he made the request that he did. Now, I get a lot of the Hindutva tropes have been coming

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:31.700
[Amit Varma]: from the 1910s 1920s. So you know, cow slaughter is an old one. Love Jihad is an old one from

01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:34.960
[Amit Varma]: after independence, we have the Hindu code bill and blah, blah, blah. All of these are

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:40.160
[Amit Varma]: standard tropes, anti Muslim tropes, often anti Dalit tropes, they've been coming around.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:45.400
[Amit Varma]: But this particular trope of, you know, Muslim migrants specifically being left out, sort

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:50.280
[Amit Varma]: of baffles me a bit because I see them as, you know, on the one hand, the whole RSS movement

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:55.080
[Amit Varma]: is right out of Nagpur. And on the other hand, the BJP is largely a North Indian party till

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:59.640
[Amit Varma]: recently when they are sort of, and now of course, they're expanding in all of these

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:05.400
[Amit Varma]: places. This is not such a huge issue, is it? I mean, it, it affects such a small number

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:09.000
[Amit Varma]: of people. I think when Nehru spoke of these kinds of migrants, once people who are coming

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.920
[Amit Varma]: back from Pakistan, I think he mentioned the whole debate as being dust on a pan. It's

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:17.600
[Amit Varma]: a minuscule number of people. Why is it then such a huge issue?

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:22.440
[Guest]: Well, for one thing that in the particular context of Assam and Northeast of India, which

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:28.040
[Guest]: we will talk about, it was not dust in the pan as it turned out, right? I mean, the flow

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:32.800
[Guest]: of people, etc, continued for much longer. Again, the numbers are very unclear because

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:37.920
[Guest]: there are no reliable statistics, but it has effectively, it has been an issue, which is

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:44.480
[Guest]: at most in the minds of people of that religion. And that has been then since, you know, taken

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:49.860
[Guest]: over by the BJP and imported onto the national agenda, right? So in a sense, this whole category

01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:55.080
[Guest]: of somebody called an infiltrator, and to contrast that infiltrator with a refugee,

01:27:55.080 --> 01:28:03.680
[Guest]: right? So, like Mr. Shah says, there are Sharanarthi, who's a refugee, and there is Ghuspetia, who's

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:11.200
[Guest]: an infiltrator. So we will pull the infiltrators out, right? Now, is anyone going to be able

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.480
[Guest]: to really establish whether they have fled because of religious persecution, etc, etc?

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:19.440
[Guest]: It's obviously as a practical point, it is moot. I think the answer is very well known.

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:26.120
[Guest]: But the reality is that this kind of a distinction allows them to make an important point, which

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:30.240
[Guest]: goes back to your earlier point, which is that I think the one very important thing

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:37.360
[Guest]: we have to recognize about the BJP's approach to these questions, right? And this is not

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:43.080
[Guest]: just about the current BJP, but I think it goes back all the way to Mr. Advani's invocation

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:50.880
[Guest]: of this notion of pseudo secularism, is that the BJP has found ways of actually packaging

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:56.600
[Guest]: each of these substantial changes that it wants to bring about to the constitutional

01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:02.040
[Guest]: sort of fabric of this country, by presenting it as if they are the vindication of various

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.320
[Guest]: kinds of progressive liberal agendas, which all of us should actually sort of most welcome.

01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:10.280
[Guest]: Why would you protest against criminalization of triple talaq? It is about Muslim women's

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:15.280
[Guest]: rights. Yeah, you're talking about patriarchy, Amit? How can you oppose it? That's the question,

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:19.840
[Guest]: right? How can you say that, listen, we are opposed to Article 370? It is about fighting

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:24.400
[Guest]: terrorism and ensuring unity of this country. Do you support terrorism? You don't, right?

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:29.960
[Guest]: So how can you support this? Why will you oppose a uniform civil code, when we agree

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:34.640
[Guest]: that we are all liberal citizens, and that it's now been such a long time? How can we

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:39.240
[Guest]: say that it's not right, let alone the fact that, you know, there are Ambedkar resigned

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:43.640
[Guest]: over the Hindu code bill? Let's face it, he was unhappy with what was being offered to

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:47.920
[Guest]: the Hindus, because he thought that was not going far enough. Right? In a sense, if you're

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:51.040
[Guest]: talking about uniform civil code, the Hindu code has as many problems as any other code

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:54.640
[Guest]: of any other community in this country has. And hopefully, we'll have a chance to discuss

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:58.600
[Guest]: that at some point of time. In fact, it has materially benefited the Hindus much more

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:02.040
[Amit Varma]: than any civil laws of any other community. I have a feeling the next time we'll do an

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:07.640
[Guest]: episode is when the uniform civil code is. So anyway, as we move from legislation to

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:12.680
[Guest]: legislation and history to history, but but the point is that they have captured this

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:18.560
[Guest]: language, right? And again, today, you know, while on the campaign trail, Mr. Shah, and

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:24.800
[Guest]: subsequently, if you read, you know, the publications of the, you know, RSS, you know, they've been

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:30.240
[Guest]: very clear that the CAB and NRC are processes. And in fact, the correct sequence is CAB should

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:32.880
[Guest]: have come first. In fact, that is a criticism of the NRC in...

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:37.120
[Amit Varma]: And this is something mind you, this is something there are these lot of defenses being made

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:40.960
[Amit Varma]: on Twitter about how these two are not connected. And as as if we are concocting them, but there

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:46.760
[Amit Varma]: are videos of Amit Shah specifically using the word sequencing, where he's talking about

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:52.040
[Guest]: how they go together. So like, come on. No, but the reality is that now that they

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:57.800
[Guest]: understand that people have gotten this nexus between these two things, and that is in some

01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:03.160
[Guest]: ways driving a lot of the concern around this thing. The attempt over the last three, four

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:05.960
[Guest]: days has been effectively to say that these are completely different things, right? So

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:12.520
[Guest]: you have all these FAQs being given by unnamed, unsigned, you know, sources within the government

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:14.080
[Guest]: which are... Alleged government releases.

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:19.840
[Guest]: Yeah, ANI and others are putting it out, right? Saying that, listen, why should the CAA, the

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:23.680
[Guest]: citizenship amendment, which has been bought in, is actually about giving citizenship,

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:27.640
[Guest]: it is not about taking citizenship away. So why are you guys assuming that anybody's citizenship

01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:31.520
[Guest]: is going to be deprived, right? So you leave NRC out of the picture altogether, right?

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:34.320
[Guest]: And then when you asked about the NRC, you say, listen, the rules are yet to be framed.

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:40.520
[Guest]: We will frame them in such liberal ways that, right? So, in a sense, this invites us to

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:49.200
[Guest]: a certain form of politics, you know, which the great German writer and film director

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:56.640
[Guest]: Alexander Kluge calls learning processes with a deadly outcome, right? If you are going

01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:00.760
[Guest]: to sit around, what they want us to do is to wait and see how this plays out. That's

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:06.560
[Guest]: what Mr. Shah has said. Please wait, see how it plays out. Yeah, that is their line. For

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:09.040
[Guest]: the rest of us, we have to understand that the outcome might actually be very deadly

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:10.440
[Guest]: for a lot of us.

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:14.080
[Amit Varma]: And Prime Minister Modi said the same thing about demonetization, give me a chance, wait

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.640
[Guest]: 50 days and blah, blah, blah.

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:19.000
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly. So, in that sense, that has been the way that they are packaging. Now,

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.360
[Guest]: again, I will say that, you know, you have to commend them for their ideological consistency

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:29.160
[Guest]: on these issues. They do have a majority. But as we discussed earlier, parliamentary

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:34.880
[Guest]: majority does not mean that you have all the rights to overturn every constitutional principle.

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:39.200
[Guest]: So long as people are willing to stand up for them, the courts are willing to stand

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:43.880
[Guest]: up for the constitution. I think there is a point still to be made, whether it gets

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.920
[Guest]: us anywhere or not, I don't know. But I think the point should be made and is being made.

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:51.680
[Amit Varma]: So Srinath, let's let's kind of move on now. And let's talk about Assam, because Assam

01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:57.840
[Amit Varma]: sort of is at the focus of a lot of this talk. And that is something that, you know, that's

01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:03.320
[Amit Varma]: a game that's been playing out for much longer than the last 70 years and much before independence.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:09.080
[Amit Varma]: And the point is, the migration has been a burning issue there from well within colonial

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.080
[Amit Varma]: times.

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:17.720
[Guest]: That's right. And I think, Assam has emerged as a major flashpoint in the current discussion.

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:21.560
[Guest]: And it has its own peculiarities. And I think it is important to understand those peculiarities

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:27.000
[Guest]: both so as not to flatten out the picture of trying to say that, listen, everybody is

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.560
[Guest]: kind of broadly thinking about the same sets of things. And secondly, also to not to tar

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:38.240
[Guest]: the Assamese sort of protests with possibly a wrong brush, right? We have to understand

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:41.800
[Guest]: their concerns from their point of view as well, before we arrive at quick judgments

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.080
[Guest]: about what those things are, right?

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:49.360
[Guest]: And as you said, Assam, the history of Assam in the 20th century, and even in fact, already

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:55.900
[Guest]: from the late 19th century has been very strongly shaped by waves of migration, right? And it's

01:33:55.900 --> 01:34:00.360
[Guest]: important to understand what are the various kinds of things that are of concern here,

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:01.360
[Guest]: right?

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:08.200
[Guest]: So, you know, the ethnic Assamese or the Khilonjiya, as they are nowadays referred to, they have

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:13.600
[Guest]: had to deal with various kinds of influxes of people and their identity has been shaped

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:19.200
[Guest]: as all identities tend to be in some degree of contradistinction with these various kinds

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:20.200
[Guest]: of things, right?

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:28.200
[Guest]: So, on the one hand, they had to face the influx of upper caste Hindu-Bengalis, particularly

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:31.880
[Guest]: from Silat, which is actually a Bengal dominated district.

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:32.880
[Guest]: Now in Bangladesh.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.440
[Guest]: Yeah, now with Bangladesh, but under colonial once, you know, the British Raj had taken

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:45.360
[Guest]: over what is today's Assam, they had attached this Bengali majority district on to Assam.

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:51.600
[Guest]: And a lot of the administration, the bureaucracy of the British Raj as it operated, the provincial

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:57.200
[Guest]: government as it operated in Assam was actually staffed by these Bengali speaking upper caste

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:01.440
[Guest]: Hindus who came from Silat, right?

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:05.840
[Guest]: And this is also a period when the Bengali language was coming into its own as part of

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:06.840
[Guest]: the so called Bengal Renaissance.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:11.600
[Guest]: So, there is a, you know, a degree of cultural assertiveness of the Bengalis of pride in

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:16.680
[Guest]: their language and culture, which naturally creates and goes against what the Assamese,

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:19.280
[Guest]: you know, so there is a, there is a fundamental problem, right?

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:26.080
[Guest]: Just as in the case of say, a state like Burma, you know, Burmese's relationship with the

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:32.880
[Guest]: British Raj is mediated through various people who were staffing the civil service who are

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:37.000
[Guest]: actually people of Indian origin, or of other peoples like your mercantile communities,

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.960
[Guest]: which are Chettiyars from what is today's Tamil Nadu, right, who are operating there.

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:42.200
[Guest]: So it's a very similar situation.

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.840
[Guest]: So it's not an unmediated relationship.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.600
[Amit Varma]: It is mediated through the Bengali Hindus, through a separate elite, which in this case

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:52.720
[Guest]: happens to be not an Assamese elite, but Bengalis, they are Bengali speaking Hindus.

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.520
[Guest]: I think that's the first point to make.

01:35:54.520 --> 01:36:00.440
[Guest]: Now, from the turn of the 20th century, right, around 1901 or thereabouts, because that's

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:08.760
[Guest]: the time and census figures we have, we experience what the great historian of Bangladesh, William

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:15.920
[Guest]: Van Schendel, calls the closing of the agrarian frontier of East Bengal, by which he means

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:23.960
[Guest]: that per capita pressure of people on every square kilometre of land in East Bengal becomes

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:28.880
[Guest]: so much, there are so many more people than the land can support, that there is a natural

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:34.880
[Guest]: migration of people from the closing frontier in search of other spaces, which where they

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:36.640
[Guest]: can work, where they can get some land.

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:41.080
[Guest]: So a lot of them are willing to go and work in parts of Assam, where, you know, others,

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:43.400
[Guest]: which are seen as areas which are there, right.

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:48.360
[Guest]: So there is, as with every migration, there is a pull factor, and there is a push factor,

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:49.360
[Guest]: right.

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:54.080
[Guest]: So in this case, the push factor is the closing of the agrarian frontier of Bengal.

01:36:54.080 --> 01:37:01.680
[Guest]: And particularly, we see that, you know, from the district of Maimansingh, of Pabna, of

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:09.000
[Guest]: Rangpur, there is a huge influx of Bengali speaking Muslims from East Bengal, many of

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.480
[Guest]: whom are people who are looking to work some piece of land where they can live and survive

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:19.160
[Guest]: work, right, because agrarian Bengal is basically facing a form of involution.

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:22.480
[Guest]: And that becomes a very important thing, right.

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.480
[Guest]: And this is pre-independence.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:27.840
[Guest]: This is again pre-independence, but the numbers are pretty striking, the number of people

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:30.440
[Guest]: who sort of come in, and who are there.

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:34.280
[Guest]: So there is a push factor, but there is also a pull factor.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:41.640
[Guest]: The British Raj sees this as a great opportunity to put more areas of Assam under various forms

01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:45.920
[Guest]: of agriculture, thereby enabling them to draw more land revenue.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:47.760
[Guest]: So they also enable these people to sort of come.

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:54.560
[Guest]: So there is a push and there's a pull because of which agricultural migrant labor from East

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:59.600
[Guest]: Bengal, majority of them Muslim speaking Bengalis come into this and those communities settle

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:04.200
[Guest]: in various parts of the Singh in the Brahmaputra Valley and other parts, you know, even today

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:08.040
[Guest]: they are referred to as MIAs, MIA Muslims, right, the MIAs are basically people who came

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:11.200
[Guest]: from Maiman Singh, but there were people who came from other parts as well, as I said,

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:14.000
[Guest]: of these adjoining areas of East Bengal.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.800
[Guest]: So you had Hindu Bengalis with whom you have a problem, then you have this huge influx

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:25.920
[Guest]: of Muslim Bengalis and the Assamese feel that, listen, you know, this is, you know, and the

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:32.080
[Guest]: whole pre partition history of Assam, in some ways, revolves around this question of how

01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:33.960
[Guest]: do we deal with these two things?

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.480
[Guest]: How do we first of all get Silat out of this thing so that we are beyond the domination

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:39.040
[Guest]: of these Bengalis?

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:43.960
[Guest]: Secondly, how do we deal with this problem of these extraordinary numbers of people who

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:47.600
[Guest]: are waves of immigration, which is happening and which seems to be changing the demography

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:53.880
[Guest]: and and the leaders of the Assam, you know, provincial Congress, etc, always made it a

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:57.200
[Guest]: point to tell the national leadership that, you know, we want the Indian nation, but you

01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:59.040
[Guest]: have to understand our peculiar problems as well.

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.040
[Guest]: And these are there, right?

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:04.240
[Guest]: And then they never got the kind of traction because as today, back then, Northeast is

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:08.840
[Guest]: seen as not just on the margins of the map of India, but on our mental maps as well,

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:09.840
[Guest]: right?

01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:12.600
[Guest]: So it never really got the kind of traction that it did.

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:15.880
[Guest]: But around the time of partition, the politics of Assam became quite heated, right?

01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:21.560
[Guest]: Because there was a feeling that, listen, we may well lose all of Assam to Pakistan,

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:25.040
[Guest]: if an eastern wing of it was created, and it was the Congress leaders of Assam were

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:29.680
[Guest]: the forefront of the opposition to the so called, you know, the cabinet mission plan

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.880
[Guest]: of 1946, which talked about some kind of a confederal arrangement, but we should have

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.760
[Guest]: clubbed Assam with the eastern province of Bengal as well, right?

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:41.960
[Guest]: And that the Assamese did not want to, and they fought tooth and nail.

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:46.960
[Guest]: And anyway, you had partition, Silat, as I said earlier on, there was a referendum and

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:51.840
[Guest]: it was, you know, attached now, then to East Pakistan subsequently became part of Bangladesh,

01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:52.840
[Guest]: right?

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:53.920
[Guest]: You have this problem.

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:58.440
[Guest]: But what happens in the context of the eastern end of the partition of India, which is Bengal

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:05.920
[Guest]: and Assam, and is that, you know, both Indian and Pakistani leaders, funnily enough, assume

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:10.960
[Guest]: that unlike the Punjab, you know, here, minorities are broadly going to stay put, because there's

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:13.800
[Guest]: not that much of large scale violence, you know, in Punjab, there was a conflagration,

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:14.800
[Guest]: right?

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:17.480
[Guest]: And one of the members of the Constituent Assembly debates calls it a holocaust, even

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:18.480
[Guest]: at that time, right?

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.480
[Guest]: It's recognized as an issue of that gravity.

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.360
[Guest]: Whereas in Bengal, you don't get that kind of sense that there's that extraordinary level

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:26.440
[Guest]: of violence which is happening, right?

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.320
[Guest]: And there are periodic strokes of violence.

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:31.880
[Guest]: In one of our previous episodes, we talked about the Bengal crisis of 1950, which comes

01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:34.480
[Guest]: out of a communal sort of riots in both places.

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:38.160
[Guest]: You know, there is a movement of people, that particular episode comes to an end due to

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.280
[Guest]: an agreement between Nehru and the Pakistani Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, which says

01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:46.040
[Guest]: that minority rights in both places will be protected, minorities can go back, they can

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:48.040
[Guest]: take possession of property, etc, right?

01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:54.240
[Guest]: Now, the Liaquat Ali Khan, you know, the Nehru-Liaquat pact also then enables in some ways, a further

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.480
[Guest]: sort of movement of people back and forth, right?

01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:01.240
[Guest]: And the Assamese are continuously concerned by what they think is the apathy of the government

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:05.360
[Guest]: of India towards their particular concern, they feel, you know, all your laws, everything

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:08.480
[Guest]: is very focused on what's happening in the western borders, but you know, you've just

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.640
[Guest]: left Assam, more or less to this thing.

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:15.000
[Guest]: But nevertheless, under the urging of the Assam government, the central government of

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:20.760
[Guest]: India in 1950, passes an act, which is called the Immigrants Expulsion from Assam Act of

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:21.760
[Guest]: 1950.

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:26.120
[Guest]: It's an act passed by the parliament, especially for Assam, which says that, listen, if there

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:31.120
[Guest]: are illegal migrants who are in Assam, there must be provisions whereby they can be sent

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:32.800
[Guest]: back from there, right?

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:37.760
[Guest]: But what happens is that soon after this act is bought into place, you have the Nehru-Liaquat

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:40.960
[Guest]: Pact, which is seen as diluting these two things.

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:46.800
[Guest]: So as a further way of assuaging the concerns of Assamese and of dealing with the particular

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:54.160
[Guest]: problem of this kind of constant flow of people through what was a porous border, in 1951,

01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:59.520
[Guest]: the Assam government undertook the exercise called NRC, National Register for Citizens,

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.800
[Guest]: which was an exercise which was conducted solely in Assam and was twinned with the census

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:06.000
[Guest]: of 1952, right?

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.960
[Guest]: So they basically took more details than what a census would including address and they

01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:11.520
[Guest]: maintain that for district by district.

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:14.520
[Guest]: So that is the original NRC, right?

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:19.680
[Guest]: So what is happening now is effectively an exercise for sort of whatever, recreating

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:22.800
[Guest]: that NRC, updating it, so to speak, right?

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:30.340
[Guest]: So that is when 1951 is when the first kind of NRC type exercise is brought in.

01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:36.600
[Guest]: But the reality is that even then, the flow of migrants because of these kinds of natural

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:42.360
[Guest]: factors, you know, that it is a what you might think of as a secularly driven thing, right?

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:47.480
[Guest]: It is not just that Hindus from East Pakistan are coming, but even Muslim migrants from

01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:50.960
[Guest]: East Pakistan still came to Assam in search of work, you know, they would be temporary,

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:54.960
[Guest]: they'd come, they'd go back, it's a porous border, and so on, right?

01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:00.440
[Guest]: Particularly in the years 1964 and 65, you had a, you know, important uptick.

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:04.120
[Guest]: You know, we have numbers, particularly for Hindu migrants of that period in the National

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:08.400
[Guest]: Archives, which I looked up as part of one of my earlier pieces of research and, you

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:14.680
[Guest]: know, in between 1964 and 65, in just those two years, you had over 800,000 Hindus who

01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:16.680
[Guest]: came from East Pakistan to India.

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:20.600
[Guest]: And these were particularly peak years, because in 1964, again, there was a bit of a communal

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:25.680
[Guest]: riot all across subcontinent, you know, there's this incident in Kashmir, where a relic, which

01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:29.360
[Guest]: is believed to be the hair of the Prophet Muhammad, it's called the Muwai Muqaddas,

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.120
[Guest]: was lost, or was stolen.

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.320
[Guest]: And there was a huge this thing.

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:36.360
[Guest]: And at that point of time, there were riots, and then the movement happened, right?

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:40.440
[Guest]: But so you didn't have those kinds of peaks, but those were sort of controllable.

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:44.240
[Guest]: But 1964, 65, again, then becomes an important year, because that's the period when there's

01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:46.640
[Guest]: a significant spike.

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:49.160
[Amit Varma]: What causes I mean, is there anything that causes a spike in particular?

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:54.000
[Guest]: As I said, it was primarily over those, you know, the fact was that, you know, the Prophet's

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.720
[Guest]: hair was supposed to have gone missing from the Hazrat Bal.

01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:02.880
[Guest]: And that then leads to a lot of protests amongst the Muslims and agitation.

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:06.280
[Guest]: And then there are communal riots, which happened not just in India, but in other parts of the

01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:09.000
[Guest]: subcontinent as well, Pakistan and East Pakistan.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.040
[Guest]: So you have Hindus fleeing from basically refugees.

01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:15.720
[Guest]: So again, what we see is that, you know, it is usually events around these kinds of things,

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:19.740
[Guest]: right, which tend to give post partition big spikes.

01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:22.800
[Guest]: As I said, you know, post the Babri Masjid, there was again, in more recent times, nothing

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:28.160
[Guest]: of comparable numbers, but still, there was even from Bangladesh, as well as Pakistan,

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:29.880
[Guest]: you had Hindus coming in.

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:30.880
[Guest]: So that is what you have.

01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:37.080
[Guest]: So anyway, so in order to deal with this burgeoning problem, the Assam government in 1964, brings

01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:42.080
[Guest]: in a piece of legislation, which is called the Foreigners Tribunal Order, which basically

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:48.360
[Guest]: sets up a series of tribunals in order to identify people who are illegal migrants into

01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:51.040
[Guest]: Assam, and then to send them back to the other side, right.

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:57.680
[Guest]: And these tribunals are active from about late 1969 till March 1973, at which point

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:01.380
[Guest]: of time the tribunals are wound up because it is felt that they have more or less done

01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:04.160
[Guest]: their job, whoever had to be identified had been done, right.

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:11.320
[Guest]: But this is also the period when another cataclysm happens in the subcontinent is the 1971 war.

01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.560
[Guest]: And the flow of approximately 10 million refugees from Bangladesh into India.

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.320
[Guest]: Which we have had an episode on.

01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:18.320
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:21.280
[Guest]: So people who are interested in the background can go back and listen.

01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:28.060
[Guest]: But what I want to say is that, you know, that the extraordinary flow of the refugees

01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:34.840
[Guest]: into India, at one stroke threatened the demographic balance of a number of parts of North India,

01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:35.840
[Guest]: right.

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:38.560
[Guest]: A state like Tripura, for instance, I mean, it had three times the number of, you know,

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.440
[Guest]: refugees than it had local people.

01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:46.320
[Guest]: And in some ways, its demographic composition was unalterably changed because of that.

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:52.160
[Guest]: But and the Indian government's own resolution and desire to ensure that these people went

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:55.320
[Guest]: back was ultimately the reason why they went to war, right, because you wanted to create

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:58.280
[Guest]: conditions where those refugees go back.

01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:01.460
[Guest]: That was Mrs. Gandhi's demand from the beginning to the end.

01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:05.660
[Amit Varma]: Because it was unviable, basically, for India to manage so many refugees, but you can't

01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:09.720
[Amit Varma]: send them back as long as there's a genocide happening, which in a sense there was.

01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:14.040
[Amit Varma]: So the best thing is that you, you know, get rid of the circumstances which make it unfriendly.

01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:19.360
[Guest]: So 10 million refugees, the numbers are obviously mind boggling for a poor country like India,

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:23.640
[Guest]: but they were all concentrated in areas where refugees and migrants and immigration was

01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:25.600
[Guest]: already such a problematic issue, right?

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.600
[Guest]: So you have to see it in that context.

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:32.560
[Guest]: Now, what happens is that in 1972, after the Bangladesh war is over, Mrs. Gandhi goes to

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:37.400
[Guest]: Dhaka and there is a sort of a set of things that she discusses with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:40.840
[Guest]: And one of the things which they agree is that when we are talking about the repatriation

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:46.800
[Guest]: of refugees from India back to Bangladesh, the cutoff date for deciding who are the people

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:50.800
[Guest]: who should be repatriated was 24th of March 1971, because it's on 25th that the crackdown

01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:53.040
[Guest]: by the Pakistan army begins.

01:46:53.040 --> 01:47:00.200
[Guest]: So they say that anyone who came before the 24th of March will not be seen as, you know,

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:01.640
[Guest]: someone who has to be deported, right?

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:06.400
[Guest]: So in effect, they are somehow de facto to be accommodated within India, and they have

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:07.400
[Guest]: to do it, right?

01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:10.800
[Guest]: Now, this is again, an international agreement, which or whatever, an understanding which

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:16.760
[Guest]: she sort of, you know, arrives at in order to solve a problem and to maintain good relations

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:20.120
[Guest]: with this new state that you have helped to create, right?

01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:22.040
[Guest]: But it has repercussions for you domestically.

01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:26.480
[Guest]: Because what happens is that then the movement in Assam then tends to become to say that,

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:30.640
[Guest]: listen, if you are really going to say that, you know, everyone who has only, you know,

01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:34.080
[Guest]: come before 1971 can stay on, what are we talking about, right?

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:39.440
[Guest]: What happens to all those people who came from 47 to 71, right, are we or 1951 to 71,

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:43.880
[Guest]: let's say when the NRC was done, those 20 years, we know that so much of movement has

01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:44.880
[Guest]: happened.

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:45.880
[Guest]: How are we going to deal with this?

01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:48.800
[Guest]: Are we going to sort of let everyone be here, then over a period of time, you know, Assamese

01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:50.120
[Guest]: are going to become a minority, right?

01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.040
[Guest]: So there is that concern, which is there.

01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:55.640
[Guest]: So you have to understand that there is a real problem, which they have to deal with,

01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.640
[Guest]: right?

01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:02.600
[Guest]: Now, in the post emergency period, you know, as with many other parts of India, the politics

01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:06.480
[Guest]: of Assam tends to get quite scrambled, right?

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:11.720
[Guest]: About a year after the emergency comes to an end, you have a first Janata government

01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:14.040
[Guest]: coming to power in this thing.

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:20.820
[Guest]: And then subsequently, when Mrs. Gandhi comes back to power, you have, you know, a new sort

01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:22.080
[Guest]: of elections which are announced.

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:25.920
[Guest]: And it is at that point of time that the All Assam Students Union, which has been sort

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:31.600
[Guest]: of a student union, which has been talking about and agitating on this issue for almost

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:39.400
[Guest]: a decade by that point of time, really starts making, you know, very urgent, important demands,

01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:43.200
[Guest]: saying that the electoral rules have to be revised, and all illegal migrants have to

01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:45.320
[Guest]: be struck out of the troll, and that we are not going to sort of this thing, right?

01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:47.720
[Guest]: So that becomes a very important demand.

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:52.440
[Guest]: And the various factions of the Janata Party, which includes the Bharatiya Jansangh, which

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:58.040
[Guest]: later becomes a BJP, all come out in various forms of support for the thing, right?

01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:03.560
[Guest]: And over the next five years, effectively, 1980-1985, you have a series of negotiations

01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:09.280
[Guest]: between the student movements in Assam and the central governments under Prime Ministers

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:15.680
[Guest]: Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, which results in the Assam Accord of 1985, right?

01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:20.540
[Guest]: And the Assam Accord of 1995, effectively, is some kind of a compromise, right?

01:49:20.540 --> 01:49:25.200
[Guest]: Because when the talks begin, the Assamese, you know, Students Union wants the cutoff

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:30.200
[Guest]: date initially for determining migrants to be the NRC of 1951.

01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:35.160
[Guest]: But then there is a moment where they say, why not choose 1966, because 64-65 are these

01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:36.160
[Guest]: top years.

01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:38.160
[Guest]: So, you know, you know, after that, we can do it.

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:40.160
[Guest]: But Indira Gandhi is very clear that, listen, it has to be 71.

01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:43.320
[Guest]: Because I have done a deal with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and, you know, we can't go back on

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:44.320
[Guest]: that stuff, right?

01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:49.480
[Guest]: So there is that is what is at the nub of these very protracted discussions about saying,

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:54.560
[Guest]: what is the point at which we have to choose in order to make these people come through,

01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:55.560
[Guest]: right?

01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:01.680
[Guest]: Now, and ultimately, the Assam Accords of 1985, basically says that 1966 becomes the

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:02.680
[Guest]: base year.

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:09.560
[Guest]: So, all migrants who came before 1966 would be deemed as Indian citizens, right?

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:16.360
[Guest]: Now, those who came to India between 1966 and 71, which is the period that Indira Gandhi

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:21.800
[Guest]: was very concerned about, should register themselves as foreigners, right?

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:27.800
[Guest]: Migrants will have to be eligible to apply for citizenship after a period of 10 years.

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:34.520
[Guest]: For those 10 years, they will not be allowed to come on the electoral roll of Assam, right?

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:38.600
[Guest]: However, they were allowed to hold something like passports for Indian government, right?

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:42.820
[Guest]: So you don't have citizenship, but you have travel documents which are given to you.

01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:46.840
[Guest]: And anyone who came after 24th of March 1971 is an illegal immigrant, right?

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:49.440
[Guest]: So you come up with this kind of a compromise thing.

01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:54.400
[Guest]: And the government of India says that, listen, we will enact this, we will revise the citizenship

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.400
[Amit Varma]: rolls.

01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:58.960
[Amit Varma]: A tangential question, though, just in practical terms, how do they determine who came when?

01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:03.480
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, what documents kind of proved that and I'm sure Jugaad can be done for those

01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:05.680
[Amit Varma]: who have the smarts, but otherwise,

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:07.800
[Guest]: I mean, so that has always been the problem, right?

01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:12.040
[Guest]: But the thing is that in order to give the Assamese a sense that listen, their state

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:15.000
[Guest]: is not being run over by this thing.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.840
[Guest]: And and also, you know, frankly, both during the Assam Accords and this thing, they were

01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:23.480
[Guest]: Muslim groups as well, which ultimately sort of signed up to these things, simply because

01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:29.360
[Guest]: they felt it will enable to put their own questions of citizenship to rest, right?

01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.240
[Unknown]: Because you know, the closure, right?

01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:36.680
[Guest]: So there's an argument that listen, my, you know, forefathers came in the early 19th,

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:40.960
[Guest]: 20th century to the to this part of Assam, you know, why should I sort of be constantly

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:41.960
[Guest]: under question mark?

01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:42.960
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:43.960
[Guest]: So I'd rather have closure, right?

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:48.240
[Guest]: So, so everybody feels that, you know, so anyway, but the problem was that once the

01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:53.480
[Guest]: Accord is signed, the actual implementation of it never really happens, simply because

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:56.080
[Guest]: of these various kinds of complexities and so on, right?

01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:59.080
[Guest]: And there is, of course, also a political dimension to it.

01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:06.400
[Guest]: The, you know, the Congress Party is seen as pro-immigrant, simply because it is benefiting

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.760
[Guest]: from some kind of a vote bank, right?

01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:14.160
[Guest]: And that perception is also sharpened when in 1980, particularly, when Mrs. Gandhi, you

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:19.400
[Guest]: know, makes the chief minister of Assam, a lady of Muslim origin called Anwara Taimur,

01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:23.560
[Guest]: who was the first Muslim woman chief minister of any state in India, as the chief minister

01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:24.560
[Guest]: of Assam.

01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:29.120
[Guest]: And, you know, that is seen as, you know, somehow legitimizing this brand of politics

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:31.080
[Guest]: of, you know, giving shelter to migrants.

01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:34.480
[Guest]: There's another thing which happens, which is very interesting, during this period, there's

01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:39.760
[Guest]: an act which is passed in 1983, called the Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunals

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:40.760
[Guest]: Act.

01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:45.520
[Guest]: Now, what, by saying that, what they say is that we'll set up tribunals, which will weed

01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:50.200
[Guest]: out illegal migrants, yeah, so we are catering to your demand.

01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:57.720
[Guest]: But actually, the provisions of the act are that it was incumbent upon neighbors of suspected

01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:00.360
[Guest]: illegal immigrants to go and complain about them, right?

01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:04.800
[Guest]: So effectively, what the government was bargaining was that we could bring in such a law.

01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:07.600
[Guest]: People would, you could tell the people of Assam that, listen, we have done something

01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:08.600
[Guest]: for you.

01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:12.720
[Guest]: But at the same time, you put the onus on communities, which are unlikely to, you know,

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:16.400
[Guest]: where people do want to work together, you trust that people believe that, you know,

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.400
[Amit Varma]: day to day living is more important than these kinds of things.

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:21.640
[Amit Varma]: How do you, how do you even prove, like, if you can't prove where you come from, how do

01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:23.320
[Amit Varma]: you even prove where your neighbor came from?

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:24.320
[Guest]: Or whatever.

01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:27.240
[Guest]: So the onus is put on the, you know, the complainant has to go and complain and so on, right?

01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:33.400
[Guest]: And in fact, the, in the Assam Accords negotiations, the, the, all Assam Students Union and others,

01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:36.220
[Guest]: they very strongly wanted this act to be repealed.

01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:40.040
[Guest]: Because they said that this is actually preventing us from, you know, doing it because, you know,

01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:43.640
[Guest]: there is no real provision there for doing these things.

01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:47.240
[Guest]: But at that point of time, when the Rajiv Gandhi government was closing it, all they

01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:51.080
[Guest]: said was that we'll give you an assurance that we will look at this particular act.

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.080
[Guest]: But it's an act of Parliament.

01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:56.120
[Guest]: We can't just as a accord between, you know, two parties, we just cannot tear it up and

01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:57.120
[Guest]: so on.

01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:58.120
[Guest]: Committee bitha denge.

01:53:58.120 --> 01:53:59.120
[Guest]: Committee bitha denge.

01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:00.120
[Guest]: Whatever, you know, in a sense that they said this.

01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:01.640
[Guest]: But it's very interesting because there is an aftermath to this.

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:09.600
[Guest]: Now, there is a public interest litigation filed against this act in the IMDT.

01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:14.760
[Guest]: And the IMDT is actually struck down by the Supreme Court in 2005 as ultra-virus of constitution.

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:20.960
[Guest]: And the person who leads this PIL is the current Chief Minister of Assam, Sarbananda Sonowal,

01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:21.960
[Guest]: right?

01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:27.080
[Guest]: So, you can see that there is a strand of the movement within Assam, which is sort of,

01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:31.320
[Guest]: you know, made this whole story of illegal immigrants, etc. central, not just in the

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:37.680
[Guest]: context of what the ASU and, you know, the students unions wanted, wanted the point of

01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:39.320
[Guest]: time with the Assam Accords, right?

01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:44.920
[Guest]: So, effectively, you had a situation where the Assam Accords promised some things, but

01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:47.440
[Guest]: they were not able to deliver that.

01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:57.240
[Guest]: And it's only from about 2005, mid 2000s, that the talk of doing another round of the

01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:59.500
[Guest]: NRC comes back into circulation.

01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:04.080
[Guest]: And by that time, you actually have a Congress government in Assam under Tarun Gogoi.

01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:08.320
[Guest]: And they feel that, listen, maybe it's time to actually sort of do this because, you know,

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:11.000
[Guest]: at various levels, they are feeling the pressure, right?

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.960
[Guest]: And as I said, one of the interesting things about the NRC exercise in Assam, the most

01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:21.040
[Guest]: recent one, which is proven to be a, you know, sort of an albatross around the state's neck,

01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:27.520
[Guest]: was that various groups and political parties wanted it for a variety of reasons, right?

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:31.760
[Guest]: So, of course, you had the Assamese and the Kelondya sort of groups, you know, who said

01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:35.120
[Guest]: that, listen, this is very important for us to identify who are the sort of foreigners.

01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:38.680
[Guest]: And, you know, there is an Assam Accord which says what the cutoff dates are, we have to

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:41.000
[Guest]: now get this done.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.280
[Guest]: Then you had the Congress Party, which is in power, which says that, listen, it's an

01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:47.600
[Guest]: issue on which we have not managed to sort of deliver.

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:49.640
[Guest]: And now, you know, Tarun Gogoi was a three-time chief minister, right?

01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:52.760
[Guest]: So, he was a fairly strong politician, he felt that, listen, we could actually shepherd

01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:54.960
[Guest]: a process like this through.

01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:59.680
[Guest]: Then you have the, you know, BJP and others who come in and make this an important sort

01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:00.680
[Guest]: of agenda.

01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:03.600
[Guest]: And then subsequently, you know, the issue comes up before the Supreme Court and the

01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:05.200
[Guest]: Supreme Court takes charge of the process, right?

01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:10.920
[Guest]: So, that's how the NRC actually ends up playing out in the context of Assam.

01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:17.000
[Guest]: But what, and it's also noteworthy that a number of intellectuals of Assam, of all political

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.720
[Guest]: persuasions, especially liberals, Marxists, you know, people like Hiren Gohen and other

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:26.560
[Guest]: very respected people actually said that maybe this will allow us to put this question behind

01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:27.560
[Guest]: us and so on.

01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:30.680
[Guest]: But that is proved to be totally a false hope.

01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:36.320
[Guest]: Because what has happened is that you eventually have today about 1.9 million people who have

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:41.040
[Guest]: not been able to, you know, prove that they are citizens.

01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:44.600
[Guest]: The government has not told us what the sort of religious compositions of these numbers

01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:45.600
[Guest]: are.

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:49.720
[Guest]: But the numbers which are doing the rounds are that maybe about a million of them are

01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:51.320
[Guest]: actually Hindus, right?

01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:55.460
[Guest]: Because Muslims in Assam, because they knew that this was coming, have been actually much

01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:59.720
[Guest]: more diligent about trying to do this and been more organized in some ways.

01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:03.080
[Guest]: And you know, now you have about a million Hindus who cannot prove it.

01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:07.640
[Guest]: And you did not have the Citizenship Amendment Act, which was passed in time for this to

01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:11.520
[Guest]: happen, for them to get this backdoor entry into it, right?

01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:15.120
[Guest]: And that is the reason now the same party which has spearheaded the movement and won

01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:20.520
[Guest]: power in Assam on the basis of the NRC saying that, you know, we are going to do that, which

01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:22.200
[Guest]: is a BJP.

01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:25.920
[Guest]: And you know, it's its ideologues in Assam have said that, you know, we don't accept

01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:26.920
[Guest]: the result of this NRC.

01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:30.120
[Guest]: Assam should have an NRC as part of a national NRC.

01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:34.240
[Guest]: And before the national NRC, you're going to have the Citizenship Amendment Bill pass

01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:35.240
[Amit Varma]: through.

01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:39.600
[Amit Varma]: And that the Citizenship Amendment Bill solves the problem of the many Hindus who do not

01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:44.000
[Amit Varma]: have papers, because hey, you can just de facto assume therefore that even if they don't

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.320
[Amit Varma]: have papers, they're refugees.

01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:46.320
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:50.080
[Guest]: But the current agitation against the CAB is precisely for that reason.

01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:56.880
[Guest]: Now, see, the Assam movement has never been particularly conceived of itself as a Hindu

01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:57.880
[Guest]: Muslim movement.

01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:03.840
[Guest]: As I said, their problem has been with their identities have been conceived of in contradistinction

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:05.400
[Guest]: to Bengalis of various kinds.

01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:09.920
[Guest]: It is Hindu Bengalis from the older lot as well as Hindu Bengalis who came from East

01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:13.720
[Guest]: Pakistan, many of whom are settled in the Barak Valley, right?

01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:17.280
[Guest]: So for people of the Ramaputra Valley, you know, the fact that, you know, that is one

01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:18.280
[Guest]: issue.

01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:23.400
[Guest]: There is the various forms of Muslim migrants from East Pakistan, Bangladesh, who have come

01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:25.800
[Guest]: in over a period of time, right?

01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:33.160
[Guest]: So the Assamese demand today in protest against the CAB is actually not a Hindu versus Muslim

01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:36.200
[Guest]: one primarily, though there are obviously like all movements, they have various strands

01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:37.200
[Guest]: of them.

01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:42.360
[Guest]: But, but the main strand is of saying, listen, the CAB cuts against the promise of the Assam

01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:43.360
[Guest]: Accords.

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:45.960
[Guest]: In the Assam Accords, you said that, listen, these are the three principles by which you

01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:49.000
[Guest]: are going to determine who is a citizen, who is not.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.660
[Guest]: So why are you creating a backdoor to allow more people to become citizens, right?

01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:57.240
[Guest]: That may serve your Hindutva agenda in the broader sense, it may, you know, help you

01:58:57.240 --> 01:58:59.720
[Guest]: give you a shot in the arm in Bengal.

01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:03.480
[Guest]: But it's going to sort of once again put us into jeopardy because our problem is that

01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:08.120
[Guest]: we are more concerned about number of Bengali speakers in the state rather than about whether

01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:09.800
[Guest]: they are primarily Hindu or Muslim, right?

01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:11.640
[Amit Varma]: So that problem has a history.

01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:15.600
[Amit Varma]: And I just want to step back here for a second, it's very easy for liberals to sort of look

01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:19.400
[Amit Varma]: at the protests in Assam and say that, oh, you know, they're being xenophobic because

01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:20.920
[Amit Varma]: they're against migration.

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:25.360
[Amit Varma]: But I just want to shift the frame of reference slightly, for example, right now we have this

01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:28.160
[Amit Varma]: default frame of reference that we belong to India.

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:32.120
[Amit Varma]: And when we look back on what our freedom fighters did in the 1910s or 20s and all that,

01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:33.320
[Amit Varma]: it seems very virtuous.

01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:37.600
[Amit Varma]: But if you shift the frame of reference, you know, one step upwards to the British Empire

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:40.640
[Amit Varma]: as such, they looked at those acts as seditious for them.

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:43.040
[Amit Varma]: Bhagat Singh is not a freedom fighter, but a terrorist.

01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:47.320
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, let's shift the frame of reference from the Indian point of view, to perhaps

01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:48.880
[Amit Varma]: the Assamese point of view.

01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:53.400
[Amit Varma]: And here I'm going to quote a para from Sanjeev Barua, whose great book India Against Itself

01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:57.880
[Amit Varma]: you recommended to me and which I link from the show notes, where he says, quote, there

01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:03.400
[Amit Varma]: is a long history of resistance to colonial and postcolonial rulers, treating the territory

02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:09.040
[Amit Varma]: as land without people, or land with barely any people, frontiers are not empty places.

02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:14.560
[Amit Varma]: It is unequal political power and often conquest that turns some people's lands into the frontiers

02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:15.560
[Amit Varma]: of other people.

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:20.440
[Amit Varma]: Efforts to reclaim their ancestral lands and the local past and to assert the historical

02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:24.680
[Amit Varma]: presence of political communities against the discourse of power have been dominant

02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:30.600
[Amit Varma]: themes in the politics of Assam and Northeast India for nearly a century, stop quote.

02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:34.040
[Amit Varma]: And everything you're saying ties into that in the sense that you have these Assamese

02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:37.880
[Amit Varma]: people, they're being ruled by these colonial oppressors.

02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:43.520
[Amit Varma]: These colonial oppressors then foist, you know, a layer of administrators above them

02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:47.000
[Amit Varma]: who tend to be these upper caste Bengali Hindus from Silhet.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:52.960
[Amit Varma]: And then because they want to sort of cultivate Assam and get more agricultural revenue and

02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:59.280
[Amit Varma]: so on, they enable the large scale migration of Bengali Muslims now from what later became

02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:00.920
[Amit Varma]: East Bengal.

02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:05.760
[Amit Varma]: And for them, it is all of these people coming into their land and intermingling.

02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:08.880
[Amit Varma]: And the questions that you have to ask is, and it's a similar question to what you ask

02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:14.320
[Amit Varma]: about Kashmir, is that it's fine, we can be proud of India as it is, you know, we managed

02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:17.040
[Amit Varma]: to integrate so many states and so much diversity.

02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:19.400
[Amit Varma]: But on the one hand, what really was the will of the people?

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:21.200
[Amit Varma]: Did we ever ascertain that?

02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:26.640
[Amit Varma]: And second, as in the case of Kashmir, though, perhaps to a greater extent, who are the people,

02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:31.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, you have to keep then redefining that, you know, so it's a much more complex

02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:36.320
[Amit Varma]: problem that is there going back to as far back as our very own freedom struggle.

02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:41.920
[Amit Varma]: And it's a quest for identity, which as Indians or as whatever other sub nationalisms we might

02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:46.360
[Amit Varma]: have sorted out, but the Assamese haven't sorted out and that is a ferment that is there.

02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:53.040
[Guest]: No, and, you know, I entirely agree with you, I think these are sort of projects and problems

02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:55.960
[Guest]: of sub nationalism and the ways to cope with it.

02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:01.560
[Guest]: And what the relationship of these sub nationalism movements of various kinds to Indian nationalism

02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:03.840
[Guest]: is has never been a settled question.

02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:10.800
[Guest]: But as I said, one of the things that the sort of founding generation of this country,

02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:15.480
[Guest]: particularly with the Constitution and the early years, attempted to do was to say that,

02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:19.560
[Guest]: listen, we have to recognize these diversities and find various ways of this, right.

02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:24.360
[Guest]: So, you know, everyone today knows Article 370, thanks to its being sort of thrown under

02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:29.360
[Guest]: the dustbin of history, but there is Article 371 as well, right, which actually makes various

02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:36.080
[Guest]: kinds of exceptions and various kinds of asymmetric provisions for various parts of India, including

02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:38.180
[Guest]: the states of the Northeast, right.

02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:42.180
[Guest]: In the Northeast itself, we've had various other kinds of things like the inner line

02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:47.080
[Guest]: permit system, right, which is there to prevent so called outsiders from coming in, right.

02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:51.800
[Guest]: And which gives this thing, there's a sixth schedule of the Indian Constitution, right,

02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:57.600
[Guest]: which again says that for scheduled tribes within certain areas of Northeast, there will

02:02:57.600 --> 02:02:59.920
[Guest]: be different kinds of provisions, right.

02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:05.660
[Guest]: So the Indian Constitution as a document is actually built on these kinds of asymmetries

02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:09.240
[Guest]: and an attempt to say that we need to have a flexible enough framework.

02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:15.640
[Guest]: And what the Assamese today are demanding is that we respect their sub nationalist sort

02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:23.200
[Guest]: of agenda and history, not tear up the Assam Accords, which is an accord signed between

02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:28.000
[Guest]: the, you know, representatives of the people of Assam and the central government of India

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.880
[Guest]: through a unilateral act, they say that it is opposed to federalism.

02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:35.000
[Guest]: In fact, you know, what is very interesting is that the earlier debates, you know, after

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:40.320
[Guest]: independence of Assamese, in Assam's relationship to India, used to be couched in the language

02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:43.400
[Guest]: of federalism, in the language of political economy, you know, it was always felt that

02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:47.240
[Guest]: Assam is a state where, you know, resources are being extracted from but production is

02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:48.240
[Guest]: never happening.

02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:51.600
[Guest]: You know, there were all these debates about situating additional oil refineries within,

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:54.160
[Guest]: you know, there was an oil refinery, which the government of India and its wisdom decided

02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:56.000
[Guest]: would be in Baroni.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.080
[Guest]: But through oil pipelines, you know, running through Assam and people felt very strongly

02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:01.480
[Guest]: that why not development for Assam, right.

02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:05.880
[Guest]: So issues of identity, therefore, I don't think are purely only about history, they're

02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:09.580
[Guest]: also about your relationship to the larger entity that you're a part of what is the nature

02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:13.440
[Guest]: of your political economy, which allows those things to happen, right.

02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:18.640
[Guest]: At this point of time, because of a certain political conjuncture, you know, we tend to

02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:21.880
[Guest]: view this as primarily driven through these things, right.

02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:28.080
[Guest]: And but I think, if you want to look ahead, and think of what might be solutions to the

02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:32.240
[Guest]: problem, which are more consonant with the kind of, you know, liberal constitutional

02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:35.840
[Guest]: structure that we adopted, then we may have to think about other things, right.

02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:39.480
[Guest]: And this is not just the talk of academics, so to speak, you know, there's a very important

02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:44.960
[Guest]: article written by Mr. GK Pillai, who was a former Home Secretary, and who knows the

02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:50.000
[Guest]: Northeast very well, when the NRC exercise had concluded in Assam.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:54.360
[Guest]: And he says, listen, when there are so many people who have been determined to be effectively

02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:58.720
[Guest]: not citizens of India, you know, it is not a problem only for Assam, it is a problem

02:04:58.720 --> 02:04:59.720
[Guest]: for all of India.

02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:05.760
[Guest]: And we have to help Assam deal with this problem, by which I think he was hinting that, you

02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:08.920
[Guest]: know, maybe other parts of India should be more welcoming of these people, we have to

02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:13.880
[Guest]: give them various kinds of long term work permits effectively to stay in India, find

02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:16.680
[Guest]: other parts of citizenship to them, if they don't want to go back.

02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:17.680
[Guest]: Right?

02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:20.160
[Guest]: Now, we cannot just say that, listen, what are we going to do with these people?

02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:25.720
[Guest]: And this idea that we are now taking as almost fait accompli, that all of these people have

02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:30.320
[Guest]: to be herded into these various kinds of detention centers, in Assam and, you know, coming up

02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:33.400
[Guest]: elsewhere with NRC being nationalized.

02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:36.920
[Guest]: It's an extraordinarily sort of, you know, illiberal solution to a problem.

02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:40.560
[Guest]: You know, these are kinds of issues which state after state is grappling with, you know,

02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:44.640
[Guest]: if there is one issue, which is, I think, you know, most liberal societies are confronted

02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:46.560
[Guest]: with that of immigration.

02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:47.560
[Guest]: This is our immigrant problem.

02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:52.880
[Guest]: You know, we have to think about it, you know, in more careful terms, rather than succumb

02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:56.680
[Guest]: to this nativism of saying that, listen, so yes, there is a problem that the Assamese

02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:57.680
[Guest]: believe.

02:05:57.680 --> 02:06:03.240
[Guest]: Now, the BJP, I think has compounded its own problems in Assam in an important way, right?

02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:11.000
[Guest]: Because on the one hand, when it came to power in 2016, the BJP presented itself as a Hilandiya

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.000
[Guest]: Sarkar, right?

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:17.440
[Guest]: As a, you know, government of the sort of native Assamese, ethnic Assamese, so to speak.

02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:22.640
[Guest]: But then its core base had always been in the Barak Valley where they were Bengali Hindus.

02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:24.840
[Guest]: That has always been where their thing is.

02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:30.440
[Guest]: Now, in order to paper over the cracks of the, you know, these things it said latched

02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:34.520
[Guest]: on to the NRC bandwagon and aggressively pushed it.

02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:39.320
[Guest]: Then now that the NRC has backfired, because perhaps up to a million Hindus are out of

02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:43.640
[Guest]: this charter, then you bring the CAB, but the CAB then means the Brahmaputra Valley

02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:47.320
[Guest]: is now saying that, sorry, you know, this does not fly with us because, you know, you

02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:48.640
[Guest]: are going back on everything, right?

02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:52.720
[Guest]: So, so there is a contradiction in the BJP's own stance, and which is why I think they

02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:57.280
[Guest]: are now at a, you know, fairly tricky point in the way that they cope with the particular

02:06:57.280 --> 02:06:59.160
[Guest]: issue in Assam itself.

02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:03.000
[Guest]: But there is another very interesting provision to the amendment bill, and now they act as

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.760
[Guest]: it stands amended, right?

02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:09.040
[Guest]: So, the bill actually says very clearly that none of these provisions about, you know,

02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:15.820
[Guest]: these various kinds of things will apply to the areas where the inner line and the six

02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:18.440
[Guest]: scheduled areas of the constitution, right?

02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:25.040
[Guest]: Now, this is, I think, intended as a sob to the other smaller states in the Northeast,

02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:27.160
[Guest]: where also the BJP has been making some inroads, right?

02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:30.800
[Guest]: So, the inner line, as we know, is a, you know, you need permits, etc, to sort of move

02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:32.120
[Guest]: in there.

02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:37.520
[Guest]: And it gives various kinds of rights to the indigenous, effectively tribal, they are the

02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:38.680
[Guest]: scheduled tribes, right?

02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:47.000
[Guest]: Six scheduled inner line, inner line more so and now the inner line currently is, was

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:51.800
[Guest]: originally operational in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland.

02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:56.520
[Guest]: You know, as this bill was being tabled in Parliament, the inner line has been extended

02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:59.440
[Guest]: to include Manipur, because they have a BJP government there and the BJP government, they

02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:03.480
[Guest]: are saying, then why should we then, because the concern is that somehow if the inner line,

02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:09.760
[Guest]: if this provision is not there, all of those naturalized citizens who are Hindus, if they

02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:13.560
[Guest]: do not find place in Assam, they will have to come to this other states of Northeast,

02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:14.560
[Guest]: right?

02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:16.780
[Guest]: So, there is a huge concern.

02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:21.960
[Guest]: But actually speaking, even this is a bit of an eye wash.

02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:25.400
[Guest]: What it does is to allow the BJP to say that we are taking into account the concerns of

02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:26.600
[Guest]: the smaller states.

02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:30.200
[Guest]: But actually, it does not change a thing in reality.

02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:36.260
[Guest]: Because between the inner line and the sixth schedule, they already turn on the difference

02:08:36.260 --> 02:08:41.840
[Guest]: between the indigene who are the scheduled tribes and others who are Indian citizens

02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:42.840
[Guest]: normally, so to speak.

02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:46.680
[Guest]: So, unless and until there is some extraordinary way by which those who are being naturalized

02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:50.580
[Guest]: as Indian citizens can also become scheduled tribes, they are not going to be able to get

02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:55.160
[Guest]: any more or any less benefits than other Indian citizens in that area will.

02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:56.840
[Amit Varma]: So, the provision is just random political posturing.

02:08:56.840 --> 02:09:01.520
[Guest]: It's just a random political posturing, which is there just to buy time.

02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:06.640
[Guest]: And the reality is that you can only buy this much time, because the peoples of those areas

02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:11.760
[Guest]: are highly sensitive to these problems, which is what I was saying that, you know, this

02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:20.240
[Guest]: attempt to play these various kinds of, you know, religiously driven politics in the Northeast

02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:24.480
[Guest]: can actually end up tearing the region apart in very important ways.

02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:27.200
[Guest]: And I think we have to be mindful of what exactly is happening there.

02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:30.840
[Guest]: So, even as we are focusing on the protests, which are happening in other parts of India,

02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:35.440
[Guest]: let's understand that Northeast of India is also at a very crucial point in its history,

02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:36.440
[Guest]: just like Kashmir is, right?

02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:41.280
[Guest]: I mean, in a sense, and there, I think there is a very important parallel, at least to

02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:45.600
[Guest]: my mind, between what happens in the case of Assam and the Northeast and what's happening

02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:46.600
[Guest]: in Kashmir, right?

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:52.560
[Guest]: Which I think is fundamentally a problem of the BJP government's approach to federalism,

02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:53.560
[Guest]: right?

02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:58.120
[Guest]: Article 370 also came out as a result of a compact between the Constituent Assembly of

02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:02.140
[Guest]: India and Sheikh Abdullah and his colleagues.

02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:07.280
[Guest]: It was negotiated over five months, that was unilaterally torn up and thrown in.

02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:11.880
[Guest]: Much the same is what the Assamese of fear are happening with the Assam Accords.

02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:16.140
[Guest]: Now, this is a fundamental problem of federalism.

02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:21.840
[Guest]: In the 370 case, it was very sad to note that many parties like DDP, etc, which were created

02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:25.440
[Guest]: on the platform of federalism, actually ended up supporting that.

02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:28.320
[Guest]: You know, a lot of others have supported the current sets of bill, but of course, a lot

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:32.440
[Guest]: of other states now, 11 by last count, have said that they're not going to allow the NRC

02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:33.440
[Guest]: to happen, right?

02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:38.800
[Guest]: So, in a sense, this is an issue as much about federalism as about other kinds of, you know,

02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:42.720
[Guest]: questions of equity, other principles, which are enshrined in the Constitution.

02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:46.040
[Amit Varma]: And my question to you would be, look, whatever I've written and read about Kashmir, and you

02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:51.640
[Amit Varma]: know, after the episode that you and I did together, my sense was that what has happened

02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:53.520
[Amit Varma]: in Kashmir this year is irreversible.

02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:57.840
[Amit Varma]: I think we will suffer the consequences for decades, because of the sort of alienation

02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:02.560
[Amit Varma]: that you've definitely created among the people there with these four months of internet blockout

02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:08.280
[Amit Varma]: and by gifting them what Mr. Shah calls normalcy.

02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:14.760
[Amit Varma]: Give me a sense of how close are the events in Assam, if not the rest of the country,

02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:19.560
[Amit Varma]: also close to reaching a sort of an irreversible stage where you can't turn the clock back

02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:24.440
[Amit Varma]: where you've created schisms, and you've created fault lines, or deepened fault lines, to an

02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:26.640
[Amit Varma]: extent where it's very hard to undo the damage.

02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:33.160
[Guest]: No, I think definitely in the context of Assam and the Ramaputra Valley, we have, you know,

02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:38.800
[Guest]: turned the clock back to a situation which was much more violent, you know, people who

02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:44.200
[Guest]: might have read newspapers in the early 1980s, you know, would routinely come across news

02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:48.000
[Guest]: about what is happening in Assam and that was a very important, very agitated period

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:53.560
[Guest]: in Assamese history, you know, there's the infamous massacre in Nellie, 1983, you know,

02:11:53.560 --> 02:12:00.320
[Guest]: where maybe up to 3000 migrants were effectively seen as illegal migrants were set upon by

02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:05.440
[Guest]: a group of indigenous plains tribals and massacred in a matter of hours, right?

02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:09.960
[Guest]: I mean, you know, there are people like Shekhar Gupta, who reported from there, who still refer

02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:12.040
[Amit Varma]: to that as a touchpoint in terms of their memory.

02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:15.560
[Amit Varma]: And imagine if 3000 migrants were massacred, not in Nellie, but in Delhi.

02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:19.760
[Guest]: Yeah, again, we'll have to check the exact number, but I think the official figures are

02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:23.440
[Guest]: lesser, but the unofficial toll puts it at 3000.

02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:31.320
[Guest]: And that, you know, the fact that we might actually be looking at going back to a period

02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:38.320
[Guest]: of such intense ethnic hostility and rivalry, to me is a very dangerous sign of what is

02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:39.320
[Guest]: to come.

02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:44.320
[Guest]: And see, ultimately, as I said, you know, these are things which can only work if we

02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:49.360
[Guest]: have a degree of patience and political judgment to understand that this is a very diverse

02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:50.360
[Guest]: country.

02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:55.400
[Guest]: You know, if we believe that, listen, there is one agenda, which is going to be set, whether

02:12:55.400 --> 02:13:01.920
[Guest]: it is ideological or political, and that we are going to ram this through, then I think

02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:04.040
[Guest]: invariably, there'll be a pushback.

02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:10.000
[Guest]: The Indira Gandhi years of Indian politics are an object historical lesson for us in

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:16.400
[Guest]: that context, the extraordinary centralization of power under Mrs. Gandhi led to various

02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:21.640
[Guest]: kinds of visiparous movements, right, the Punjab, Assam, all of these began in the context

02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:28.120
[Guest]: where you had a central government, which was abusing constitutionally vested powers,

02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:32.040
[Guest]: in her case, particularly with Article 356, and the imposition of President's Rule, and

02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:35.960
[Guest]: of course, subsequently, the emergency provisions, and the imposition of the emergency and all

02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:39.680
[Guest]: the other, you know, brutality which went with that.

02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:46.080
[Guest]: Now, that, you know, it is if you want to keep this country as a broadly functioning

02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:51.600
[Guest]: federation, you know, then I think that degree of excessive centralization is always going

02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:53.240
[Guest]: to be problematic, right.

02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:57.880
[Guest]: And the dialectic between excessive centralization and devolution of powers to provinces is a

02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:02.240
[Guest]: much larger one playing out throughout, you know, modern Indian history and going back

02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:06.040
[Guest]: at least to, you know, to several centuries.

02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:09.920
[Guest]: So in that sense, we have to learn something from our own history.

02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:13.360
[Amit Varma]: And you know, two sort of related questions here.

02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:19.960
[Amit Varma]: One is that we had almost at some point assumed that recently, especially after the election

02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:26.240
[Amit Varma]: results were out, that the BJP have gained some kind of intellectual hegemony in India

02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:31.720
[Amit Varma]: that that finally their side of the story that that their ideology has sort of won the

02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:32.720
[Amit Varma]: day.

02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:37.480
[Amit Varma]: I was sitting earlier today at Carbox, which should actually be which is actually in Santa

02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:39.960
[Amit Varma]: Cruz, but it's okay to call it Carbox.

02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:44.800
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned to me that you disagreed with that thinking and you wouldn't call it a hegemony.

02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:45.800
[Guest]: Can you elaborate on that?

02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:51.400
[Guest]: Well, I mean, the argument about hegemony is basically to say that, listen, you have

02:14:51.400 --> 02:15:01.460
[Guest]: a political party, which commands the consent of a majority of people in this country, right.

02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:02.960
[Guest]: And every hegemony is always partial.

02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:06.280
[Guest]: In fact, by definition, Antonio Gramsci, the person who kind of, you know, came up with

02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:14.000
[Guest]: the modern sort of notions of hegemony, the Italian Marxist thinker, Gramsci is, you know,

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.640
[Guest]: one of his important points about hegemony is that hegemony is always the interest of

02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:22.680
[Guest]: one group, which is laying claim to represent the interests of the rest of the society,

02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:26.720
[Guest]: right, to the extent that you're able to persuade the rest of the society, that their interests

02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:33.160
[Guest]: are actually best represented by your interest and your platform, you have commanded hegemony,

02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:34.160
[Guest]: right.

02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:40.400
[Guest]: The other way of thinking about hegemony is that consent in an hegemonic system always

02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:41.400
[Guest]: is greater than coercion.

02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:46.400
[Guest]: So, you don't need to use the tanda, so to speak, to keep people in check, right.

02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:51.240
[Guest]: And in some ways, electoral systems, automatically democratic parliamentary systems like ours

02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:56.720
[Guest]: and also other kinds of systems, which are based on electing leaders, do confer a degree

02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:00.400
[Guest]: of legitimacy, because we believe in the legitimacy of the process, we may dislike this or that

02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:02.080
[Guest]: party, but we will always accept the outcome.

02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:07.680
[Guest]: To that extent, you know, there is a mechanism for legitimation for gaining hegemony, which

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:08.960
[Guest]: is there.

02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:13.200
[Guest]: But the discussion around hegemony and here, you know, there have been very interesting

02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:19.640
[Guest]: writings by Yogendra Yadav, my friend Milan Vaishnav, others have written about this particular

02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:24.840
[Guest]: thing is to say, you know, what is the nature of that kind of hegemony and to what extent

02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:26.680
[Guest]: have they actually managed to do it, right.

02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:33.960
[Guest]: And I think the second sort of victory in 2019, and the increase to a 300 plus majority,

02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:38.840
[Guest]: effectively was seen as a great approbation, right.

02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:41.400
[Guest]: And again, I don't want to minimize the scale of that victory.

02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:42.400
[Guest]: Don't read me wrong.

02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:48.360
[Guest]: I mean, I think getting, you know, 35% plus vote share in a first pass the post system

02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:51.280
[Guest]: is a formidable achievement for most political parties.

02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:54.480
[Guest]: So I wouldn't want to minimize that even one bit.

02:16:54.480 --> 02:17:00.320
[Guest]: But I think from there to suggest that listen, hegemony is kind of more or less in place

02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:07.420
[Guest]: because you know, 370 just look at it, people just applaud what they are doing, was to perhaps

02:17:07.420 --> 02:17:10.840
[Guest]: misunderstand the challenges of hegemony, right.

02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:15.800
[Guest]: And to understand that hegemony is a very friable project, you know, what seems as commanding

02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:21.040
[Guest]: concept at any point of time, can always be shown up to be not quite what it is.

02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:25.120
[Guest]: And I think this moment to me is important, not because I don't know what the political

02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:26.640
[Guest]: future of this country is, and so on.

02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:35.480
[Guest]: But to me, what it suggests is that we may have exaggerated notions of the BJP's hegemony,

02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:40.600
[Guest]: the way in which the law enforcement machinery has been used even in the recent past, not

02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:46.120
[Guest]: to mention the way in which the media has been suborned for a while now, and other institutions

02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:51.720
[Guest]: have been let loose on political opponents, you know, etc.

02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:57.320
[Guest]: I don't want to say anything about the judiciary suggests that, you know, actually speaking,

02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:02.040
[Guest]: the margin of coercion seems to be greater than the margin of consent out here.

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:05.820
[Guest]: And the BJP simply cannot take consent for granted.

02:18:05.820 --> 02:18:11.000
[Guest]: It cannot assume that just because it has won a majority, a thumping majority, no less,

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:17.120
[Guest]: on the basis of a political platform, that every bit of that platform is, you know, ticked

02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:21.280
[Guest]: off by the people irrespective of whether it cuts against their fundamental rights,

02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:24.120
[Guest]: and you know, what the protections of the Constitution are.

02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:28.040
[Guest]: I think that in that sense, you know, this moment suggests as you know, to invoke a phrase

02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:33.160
[Guest]: from the great historian Ranajit Guha, you know, there is dominance, but perhaps without

02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:34.160
[Amit Varma]: hegemony.

02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:39.320
[Amit Varma]: No, and in fact, you know, that video, which, you know, all of us have seen, which you know,

02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:43.800
[Amit Varma]: of Ram Guha being surrounded by those three uniformed cops and sort of dragged away by

02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:47.840
[Amit Varma]: the arm was at first heartbreaking, but also heartening, because then it shows you the

02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:48.840
[Amit Varma]: power of ideas.

02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:54.720
[Amit Varma]: It you know, that three uniform men need to that there is so much fear in the establishment,

02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:58.960
[Amit Varma]: that they are striking out with that they feel the need to strike down with the force

02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:03.320
[Amit Varma]: of the state with coercion, as you said, and you cannot take consent for granted.

02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:08.200
[Amit Varma]: And what is even more heartening, and this is what I want to sort of ask you about next,

02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:12.200
[Amit Varma]: as we have spoken about students movements in past episodes.

02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:15.360
[Amit Varma]: And this is so incredibly heartening that you have the opposition parties who are pretty

02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:20.400
[Amit Varma]: much absent from the fray, who are unable to say anything new or original who are unable

02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:22.400
[Amit Varma]: to oppose in constructive ways.

02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:26.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, all of this is happening in a week where Madhya Pradesh I think offered that

02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:29.600
[Amit Varma]: if you give blanket to cows, you get gun licenses, some nonsense like that.

02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:33.320
[Amit Varma]: And that's a Congress rule state, which is why I say the Congress is a party of Kamal

02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:36.880
[Amit Varma]: Nath, not Rahul Gandhi, because in practice, that is what they are.

02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:42.440
[Amit Varma]: But leaving that sort of rant aside, it's just incredibly heartening to see so many

02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:44.080
[Amit Varma]: students come together.

02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:48.400
[Amit Varma]: And these are spontaneous demonstrations in some cases, like in Delhi, for example, the

02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:53.120
[Amit Varma]: mobile internet was shut down in large parts in Bangalore section 144 was imposed.

02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:58.160
[Amit Varma]: In fact, 144 was imposed in all of Uttar Pradesh 200 million people, which is mind blowing.

02:19:58.160 --> 02:20:04.080
[Amit Varma]: And I think pretty unprecedented and, you know, it's beyond colonial, and it's just

02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:05.080
[Amit Varma]: incredible.

02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:11.160
[Guest]: No, and I think it's also an important moment in the history of student movements and, you

02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:14.920
[Guest]: know, in the context of 20th century India itself, right?

02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:19.960
[Guest]: Because the students have been a part of much of the mobilization around the nationalist

02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:22.960
[Guest]: movement, which happened from 1920 thereabouts, right?

02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:26.680
[Guest]: So, they were in the non cooperation movement, Gandhiji called on them to sort of leave their

02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:28.200
[Guest]: colleges and schools.

02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:31.120
[Guest]: They were part of the civil disobedience movement, they were very fundamentally a part of the

02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:33.040
[Guest]: Quit India movement of 1942.

02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:36.840
[Guest]: And then, you know, we have some very fine historical accounts of their involvement in

02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:37.840
[Guest]: those things.

02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:42.880
[Guest]: Post independence, you know, there was the sense that, listen, now it's time for students

02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:46.280
[Guest]: to focus on national development and their own betterment and, you know, these kinds

02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:47.280
[Amit Varma]: of things.

02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:50.040
[Amit Varma]: Ambedkar's warning about, you know, why don't you give up the grammar of anarchy, we have

02:20:50.040 --> 02:20:51.560
[Amit Varma]: one freedom now as if.

02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:55.480
[Guest]: Yeah, but that was especially applicable to the students, you know, in 1955, I think there

02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:59.240
[Guest]: was a, you know, a student unrest and a couple of students were shot down in Patna.

02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:00.800
[Guest]: And Jawaharlal Nehru actually goes there.

02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:04.700
[Guest]: And he says that, you know, it is one thing to engage in intellectual politics.

02:21:04.700 --> 02:21:07.840
[Guest]: But this kind of demonstration, dharna and all that stuff is unacceptable, right?

02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:12.120
[Guest]: So, there is this, you know, standard reflex that listen, you guys should contribute to

02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:15.160
[Guest]: the nation rather than, you know, so the metaphor of discipline.

02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:18.520
[Guest]: At which point the students should have said, okay, boomer to him.

02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:19.520
[Guest]: Well, yeah.

02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:25.000
[Guest]: So, so, so those kinds of, you know, it is a, let's put it this way, I mean, you know,

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:29.200
[Guest]: that strain of thinking has been quite ingrained in post-colonial India, despite this.

02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:32.880
[Guest]: But that has never stopped students movements from being important, right?

02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:40.240
[Guest]: If you think of practically every major state reorganization movement, right, around linguistic

02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:44.840
[Guest]: nationalism, sub nationalism, you know, questions of regional identity, and so on, you know,

02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:49.400
[Guest]: there's a Samyukta Maharashtra movement, you think of, you know, the Andhra movement, which

02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:56.440
[Guest]: began with, you know, if you think of, say, the anti Hindi agitations in Tamil Nadu, think

02:21:56.440 --> 02:22:00.360
[Guest]: of Assam, which we've spoken about, all of these were, you know, students were pretty

02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:03.680
[Guest]: much, you know, front and center, right?

02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:09.480
[Guest]: But from the late 60s, there is a certain turn in this kind of student and in fact,

02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:13.480
[Guest]: I think from that point, you should perhaps start calling it as youth sort of movements

02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:18.200
[Guest]: and youth politics, because the youth as a category come into its own, really from the

02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:23.880
[Guest]: late 1960s, right, because that's when your, you know, your institutions of higher education

02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:27.480
[Guest]: start getting significant numbers, there's an expansion of campuses, more people staying

02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:28.480
[Guest]: on campus.

02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:29.840
[Guest]: So campus issues become very important, right?

02:22:29.840 --> 02:22:34.080
[Guest]: Even now, the precursor to this was like things around what's happening in campuses, JNU,

02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:37.640
[Guest]: you know, it's not just that, you know, this happened today, right?

02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:38.640
[Guest]: So those kinds of issues.

02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:44.080
[Guest]: So in a sense, the youth as an autonomous kind of force in Indian politics really, again,

02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:48.520
[Guest]: just like as it happens globally, everywhere, you know, 67, 68, thereabouts is very important

02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:49.520
[Guest]: in India, right?

02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:52.800
[Guest]: And particularly in the context of West Bengal with the Naxalbari movement, a lot of young

02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:56.720
[Guest]: students who move out, go to the countryside to agitate, you know, spread the flame of

02:22:56.720 --> 02:22:58.360
[Guest]: revolution, etc.

02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:00.160
[Guest]: There's a huge crackdown upon them.

02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:01.920
[Guest]: But that is an important moment, right?

02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:05.840
[Guest]: That's also incidentally, an important moment in Pakistan, and the student movement in Pakistan

02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:12.360
[Guest]: actually deposes Ayub Khan in 1969, as we've sort of discussed in that episode on Bangladesh.

02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:15.920
[Guest]: But you fast forward to late 1973-74, right?

02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:20.800
[Guest]: You have students movements in two states in India, in Gujarat, the Narmad movement,

02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:25.480
[Guest]: and then in Bihar, both of which are again, you know, start around student issues, then

02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:27.040
[Guest]: morph into bigger things.

02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:31.640
[Guest]: And then ultimately, Jayaprakash Narayan, you know, comes in as the person who's providing

02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:32.640
[Amit Varma]: moral and national...

02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:36.800
[Amit Varma]: The two of the young leaders who came up in the student movement in Bihar were Lalu Prasad

02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:37.840
[Guest]: and Nitish Yadav.

02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:43.480
[Guest]: If you think about Indian politics today, practically every major leader that you can

02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:50.920
[Guest]: think of, has entered politics in that crucible of the period between 1974 and 77.

02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:53.960
[Guest]: It's as true of Congress Party as it is of the opposition.

02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:54.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact...

02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:56.560
[Guest]: Jaitley being a student leader and...

02:23:56.560 --> 02:24:01.120
[Guest]: Sushma Swaraj, Mr. Modi himself, you know, was there.

02:24:01.120 --> 02:24:06.480
[Guest]: You look beyond, look at the OBC leadership of North India, as you talked about, right?

02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:11.440
[Guest]: Lalu Yadav, Nitish Kumar, come to my state, Tamil Nadu, I mean, Stalin, who was the chief

02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:15.840
[Guest]: minister of the, you know, was his father, but you know, he was in the forefront of agitation,

02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:19.360
[Guest]: got beaten up, was in custody, and so on.

02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:21.280
[Guest]: All of these leaders actually came to the fore.

02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:26.920
[Guest]: So in a sense, that was an extraordinary moment, where this conjuncture of youth movements,

02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:31.320
[Guest]: the anti-emergency, subsequent anti-emergency protests, and you know, that period really

02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:36.680
[Guest]: created a new set of leadership with new sets of ideas, and so on.

02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:41.000
[Guest]: If you fast forward to 1990 or thereabouts, you know, people of our generation, we will

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:45.200
[Guest]: remove the anti-Mandal thing, right, which is not a progressive thing, as perhaps you

02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:47.020
[Guest]: and I will think about it, right?

02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:53.680
[Guest]: But what is interesting about the current moment, I think, is that its scale and scope

02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:58.320
[Guest]: is much wider, it is much more spontaneous, less organized, less dependent on any kind

02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:03.720
[Guest]: of external direction, at least until this point of time, on what, unlike this thing,

02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:04.720
[Guest]: right?

02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:07.960
[Guest]: So in that sense, I think it was Pratap Bhanu Mehta, who wrote in his column day before

02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:13.720
[Guest]: yesterday, that this is the largest student sort of movement we've seen since 1974.

02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:15.200
[Guest]: And I think he's right.

02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:17.800
[Guest]: Which, of course, was followed by the emergency then.

02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:18.800
[Guest]: That's right.

02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:19.800
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:24.080
[Guest]: But, you know, again, history, you know, may not repeat itself, it may rhyme.

02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:28.760
[Guest]: But the, the reality is that, you know, in that sense, this has been quite a striking

02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:29.760
[Guest]: thing for us to watch.

02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:33.800
[Guest]: And I think, again, you know, we should not be parochial, just look at Indian history.

02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:37.040
[Guest]: But I think look around, I mean, see what has happened in the Arab Spring in various

02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:38.200
[Guest]: countries in the world, right?

02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:43.120
[Guest]: Because this is politics driven by, you know, various forms of connectivity, which simply

02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:44.920
[Guest]: were not available to an earlier generation, right?

02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:48.320
[Guest]: I mean, the speed with which, you know, even WhatsApp messages are going around saying,

02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:49.320
[Guest]: are you going to this protest?

02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:51.640
[Guest]: Here is a list of lawyers, if you get caught up, just call one of them.

02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:55.760
[Amit Varma]: It's a globalized spread of ideas, and just to see some of the placards, like one particularly

02:25:55.760 --> 02:26:01.400
[Amit Varma]: memorable placard in Bombay was, Jab Hindu-Muslim Raazi toh kya karega, Naazji?

02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:05.520
[Guest]: Yes, and, and of course, you know, as with many of these movements in the past, but more

02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:10.880
[Guest]: so today, the presence of young women, you know, and in such large numbers, you know,

02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:15.560
[Guest]: and leading that the formation of ideas, it's, it is very interesting.

02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:21.560
[Guest]: But at the same time, you know, I think history, including Indian history, suggests that student

02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:23.600
[Guest]: movements always have had their limitations.

02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:28.160
[Guest]: So it is important to recognize those as well, you know, not to assume that, you know, there

02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:32.320
[Guest]: are some kind of inbuilt problems, which is that, you know, the historian Eric Hobsbawm

02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:35.840
[Guest]: used to say the problem with student generations is that they only last for three or four years,

02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:36.840
[Amit Varma]: right?

02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:40.640
[Amit Varma]: So you won't have a permanent leadership structure emerging and something building over time,

02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:44.600
[Amit Varma]: these kids will be gone in a couple of years, they'll be doing jobs, they'll be doing MBAs.

02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:48.040
[Amit Varma]: But you know, this is not just a student movement of the youth movement.

02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:49.040
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:50.040
[Guest]: That's what I was saying.

02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:53.200
[Guest]: You know, it's a youth movement, which has also galvanized so many other people, right?

02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:58.000
[Amit Varma]: And I'm also struck by the different ways of protesting, especially by the women.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.480
[Amit Varma]: For example, one, there is that iconic video of those, you know, first, there's this guy

02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:07.280
[Amit Varma]: who's trying to stop his lady friends from, you know, going out against the police and

02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:08.580
[Amit Varma]: confronting them.

02:27:08.580 --> 02:27:09.840
[Amit Varma]: And the cops come and drag him away.

02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:14.480
[Amit Varma]: And then all these women go and surround him and they, you know, save him from the lattice.

02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:19.200
[Amit Varma]: And the other very striking image of this young girl with a placard, and the placard

02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:23.120
[Amit Varma]: says that my father wants me to study history, but I want to make it and she's offering a

02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:25.360
[Amit Varma]: rose to the sheepish policeman.

02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:26.360
[Amit Varma]: Those are beautiful images.

02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:27.920
[Guest]: It's so Gandhian also.

02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:28.920
[Guest]: Yes.

02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:32.680
[Guest]: And, you know, I think there is one thing that these young people have realized and

02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:37.360
[Guest]: made us all realize, I think, which is, I think Gandhi would have thought of it as his

02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:43.240
[Guest]: fundamental point, which he used to say is abhaya, to be fearless, right?

02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:48.400
[Guest]: I think what has, and this is the reason I say that, you know, the hegemony of the BJP

02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:51.200
[Guest]: seems more friable and brittle than what we thought.

02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:55.360
[Amit Varma]: Because today it is a state which is scared and the citizens are standing up.

02:27:55.360 --> 02:27:56.560
[Guest]: They are fearless, like you said.

02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:01.200
[Guest]: So again, I will say that, you know, it's important to understand that this is going

02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:05.960
[Guest]: to be a long drawn out process, you know, I think this kind of people coming out, standing

02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:10.760
[Guest]: up for their constitutionally guaranteed rights, their, you know, cherished notions of what

02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:13.280
[Guest]: it means to be an Indian, etc. is important.

02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:18.240
[Guest]: But there is also a danger that I increasingly find with our world of social media that,

02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:19.960
[Guest]: you know, we can become something of an echo chamber.

02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:24.580
[Guest]: I mean, let's also understand that there must be a lot of people out there who do not accept

02:28:24.580 --> 02:28:30.480
[Guest]: what is happening, who may think that these laws are right, who in due course will be

02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:34.420
[Guest]: mobilizing as we've already seen ABVP and other student groups trying to mobilize.

02:28:34.420 --> 02:28:38.720
[Guest]: At this point of time, as you're saying, yes, I think it has come as a surprise, if not

02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:44.440
[Guest]: a shock, that things could sort of snowball out of control so quickly.

02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:49.680
[Guest]: But I think the success of this moment will also, you know, as you said, have to be measured

02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:51.600
[Guest]: through various yardstick.

02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:56.440
[Guest]: And, you know, as a former army person, you know, I'm always aware of the coercive sort

02:28:56.440 --> 02:29:00.960
[Guest]: of power which the Indian state wheels, you know, I've had an insider's view of what that

02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:01.960
[Amit Varma]: means.

02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:04.840
[Amit Varma]: No, maybe this can be a crucible through which future leaders can emerge and also, you know,

02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:09.600
[Amit Varma]: I used to worry about liberal elite echo chambers, but 100,000 people at Azad Maidan is not an

02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:10.600
[Guest]: echo chamber.

02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:11.600
[Guest]: Absolutely, yeah, precisely.

02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:17.980
[Guest]: All I'm trying to say is that, you know, it puts paid to this idea that, listen, you know,

02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:22.880
[Guest]: in a sense, the ideological battle is over, right, that the battle of ideas and of politics

02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:23.880
[Guest]: is over.

02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:27.640
[Guest]: Now it is all about striking these low kind of compromises to which coalition government

02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:28.760
[Guest]: can stop whom, where.

02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:33.440
[Guest]: I think that story will continue, as you said, you know, the fate of the opposition and that

02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:36.280
[Guest]: of the Congress Party is a discussion for another day.

02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:40.400
[Guest]: But at this point of time, you know, I think it's definitely heartening to see that there

02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:41.400
[Guest]: is so much there.

02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:45.800
[Guest]: And I think, you know, we have to remember one thing, you know, see, democracy is a very

02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:52.040
[Guest]: peculiar form of a political system, you know, because say, unlike older forms of systems,

02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:54.400
[Guest]: there is no divine right to rule.

02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:58.400
[Guest]: There is no divinely sanctioned ruling class who can tell you what you do.

02:29:58.400 --> 02:30:02.080
[Guest]: Unlike say the socialist regimes of the 20th century, you don't have an ideology which

02:30:02.080 --> 02:30:04.680
[Guest]: is going to prescribe to you what you have to do.

02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:07.560
[Guest]: So democracy is fundamentally about learning from our own experience.

02:30:07.560 --> 02:30:12.080
[Guest]: And I think history and our experience is very important, I think it's important constantly

02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:18.360
[Guest]: to revisit that, to learn from it, and to make history as much as we read it.

02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:22.640
[Amit Varma]: And on these wise words, since we are running out of studio time, we could have spoken for

02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:26.440
[Amit Varma]: another couple of hours, and I'm going to have to thank you for coming on the show.

02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:28.960
[Amit Varma]: It's always such a pleasure and such a learning experience for me, Sreenath.

02:30:28.960 --> 02:30:29.960
[Guest]: No, not at all.

02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:33.200
[Guest]: It's always great to be here and to have this opportunity to have a sustained conversation

02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:35.620
[Amit Varma]: with you.

02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:38.440
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoyed listening to this podcast, listen, I recommend you listen to another

02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:39.440
[Amit Varma]: podcast.

02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:40.520
[Amit Varma]: It's called Interpreting India.

02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:42.680
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, it's hosted by Sreenath.

02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:44.760
[Amit Varma]: It's done by Carnegie where he works.

02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:48.280
[Amit Varma]: So do a Google search for Interpreting India and check that out.

02:30:48.280 --> 02:30:50.200
[Amit Varma]: That's worth listening to.

02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:55.040
[Amit Varma]: You should also head on over to Amazon and buy Sreenath's excellent books.

02:30:55.040 --> 02:30:58.620
[Amit Varma]: My previous episodes with him will be linked in the show notes at cnuncine.in.

02:30:58.620 --> 02:30:59.620
[Amit Varma]: Check those out.

02:30:59.620 --> 02:31:03.000
[Amit Varma]: You can follow Sreenath on Twitter as SreenathRaghava3.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:04.920
