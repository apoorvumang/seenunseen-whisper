[Amit Varma]: Parsis in Mumbai instead of being left at the Tower of Silence after they die are now cremated and why because a cow fell

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.280
[Amit Varma]: One of them was seen but two were unseen. Did you know that many well-intentioned government policies hurt the people?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.800
[Amit Varma]: They're supposed to help

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.360
[Amit Varma]: Why was demonetization a bad idea? How should GST have been implemented?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.240

[Amit Varma]: How did we communicate with each other before the internet? Were you rude to random strangers?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.200
[Amit Varma]: Did you call people names just because they disagreed with you on something?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.320
[Amit Varma]: Did you have close friends you had never even met?

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.120
[Amit Varma]: Were you running around the neighborhood showing photographs of your food to everyone?

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.600
[Amit Varma]: If someone said something funny, did you respond with a string of letters like LOL or ROT FL AMO?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.440
[Amit Varma]: Did you look people in the eye when you spoke to them? In fact, that's a pretty good question. Did you look them in the eye?

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.120
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen our weekly podcast on economics politics and behavioral science, please. Welcome your host

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.720
[Amit Varma]: Amitabh welcome to the seen in the unseen my topic for today is online

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.840
[Amit Varma]: conversations the internet has transformed how we speak to one another and

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.600
[Amit Varma]: Indeed how we exist as society and even how we are as individuals on the one hand

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.800
[Amit Varma]: We've been empowered with information and knowledge and the ability to make connections both with other people and with new ideas

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.760
[Amit Varma]: We have wider and more diverse social circles. All our interactions are so much richer

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.520
[Amit Varma]: But on the flip side the internet seems to reveal the dark side of human nature

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.000
[Amit Varma]: Anonymity emboldens us to express our deepest prejudices all the bigotry and misogyny

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.840
[Amit Varma]: We otherwise never would show to anyone and we behave in ways online that we would not even consider in real life

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.800
[Amit Varma]: Also instead of bringing us together the internet might actually be driving us apart

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.560
[Amit Varma]: the internet makes it possible for us to form different echo chambers really large echo chambers of people who share our interest or

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.760
[Amit Varma]: ideologies or prejudices some of them repulsive to others even as we close ourselves off to views and people who don't match us as

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.200
[Amit Varma]: A society we are getting more and more polarized as

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.040
[Amit Varma]: Individuals we are becoming more and more strident and judgmental. How did we get here?

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.760
[Amit Varma]: What can we do about it? To discuss all this I have with me a guest who has seen this evolution of human conversation

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.880
[Amit Varma]: Close up

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.240
[Amit Varma]: Nikhil has been a moderator at reddit for a few years and I bumped into him socially a few days ago and had a fascinating

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.240
[Amit Varma]: Conversation with him. He's a perfect guest for the seen and the unseen

[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen in the unseen Nikhil. Hi nice to be here

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.360
[Amit Varma]: So I'm really fascinated of what made you start off as a moderator on reddit like were you a user before that?

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.680
[Guest]: Actually, yes, so I

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.120
[Guest]: Used to be on a lot of online forums. I enjoy talking online

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.440
[Guest]: I like quite often I like the anonymity and I like the ability to engage with people from many different places

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.920
[Guest]: And it's always been very fascinating to see how interactions happen

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.600
[Guest]: It's I've seen people lose their minds because some small thing happened in a video game or some small change

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.560
[Guest]: And then I've seen other really high

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.280
[Guest]: sophisticated discussions on the most

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.960
[Guest]: Minute parts of code and computer architecture somewhere else. So I was wondering what made a difference

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.280
[Guest]: So I read it was the new big thing and it was one of the few places where you got a lot of interesting

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.880
[Guest]: Conversation and I was there for a long while and in the subreddit which I was on just sort of a constrained topic forum

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.080
[Guest]: Where they were looking for moderators. They were looking for people to help them deal with the influx of new users and

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.160
[Guest]: Disruptive behavior to put it mildly which they were seeing and

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.480
[Guest]: I'd always been on the forum as a user. I always communicate and I always suggest ideas, which I had seen work in other places and

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.440
[Guest]: They finally said that you know, you've been here for so long. You have all these ideas

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.440
[Guest]: Why don't you try and implement them?

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.680
[Guest]: And I thought it's been years of me looking at all of these other forums and all of these other ideas

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.640
[Guest]: So let's try let's see what happens if we implement them

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:59.400
[Amit Varma]: So I'll ask you a personal question. Were you a different person offline than you were online when you got online?

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.400
[Guest]: Well, that's a difficult question to answer

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.120
[Guest]: I think yes to a certain degree of online I am

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.440
[Guest]: Far, it's more about what ideas I have. So I reduce my interactions to those topics, which I feel strongly about and

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.200
[Guest]: I can express or have or try to have an opinion on

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.880
[Guest]: Whereas in real life, there are a lot of topics where I just don't know anything whatsoever, and I have to interact on them

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.440
[Guest]: And so I tend to be a little bit more

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.400
[Guest]: reticent

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.160
[Guest]: in real life

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.800
[Guest]: Then I am online, but then online there are a lot of places

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.040
[Guest]: I avoid interacting because I believe that I'm really not in a good position to talk about it

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.160
[Amit Varma]: Right. So offline essentially you're you know, you're mixing with people and you're doing small talk

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.640
[Amit Varma]: But you're never actually doing small talk online in your case

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.360
[Amit Varma]: You're just engaging when the subject concerns you deeply

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.520
[Guest]: Usually of course there are always something or topics or the other which are just amusing or some

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.000
[Guest]: Ridiculous picture of cats or something or the other which just catches your eye and you will say something stupid out there

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.280
[Guest]: But yeah, if you look at but you can usually find out what topics i'm very interested in if someone were to

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.120
[Guest]: Just go through the comments i've written on the topics i've spoken about so yes

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.640
[Guest]: And is there any early online behavior from you which you now regret?

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.360
[Amit Varma]: That's another tough one. I would love to say no

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.480
[Guest]: I really can't think of anything at this point even something that's mildly embarrassing not that you would regret

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.520
[Amit Varma]: Or mildly embarrassing I do on a regular basis. So that's really not changed

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.720
[Guest]: There every so often there are comments where I do talk about a topic which I want to know more about

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.400
[Guest]: and

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.120
[Guest]: So for example, if there's an advanced subject, which I want to learn

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.680
[Guest]: I go there I look at what other people are talking about

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.360
[Guest]: And then I try and put my opinion of forward and then I realize a little later

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.360
[Guest]: I really didn't know what I was talking about and that's incredibly embarrassing

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.080
[Guest]: So how uh, like when you became from being a heavy user when you became a moderator

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.080
[Amit Varma]: Uh, what did you learn?

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.480
[Amit Varma]: How did that change the way you looked at reddit and at the kind of online conversations you were part of?

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.880
[Amit Varma]: That's a big topic. So I think this in itself should be broken up into parts. Let's break it up

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:03.800
[Guest]: Sure, so let's discuss why so first and foremost I come in from this. I really want to see conversation online succeed

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.040
[Guest]: I think it's really important for all of us. We do most of our conversation online and frankly

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.920
[Guest]: A large portion of our personalities today is just done by typing words in

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.000
[Guest]: So not being able to type words in being banned or being

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:23.000
[Guest]: Restricted from saying something is effectively having that part of you online amputated

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.480
[Guest]: Because there is only the act of speaking you can do online

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.800
[Guest]: You can only speak and not being able to speak is a very big thing

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.640
[Guest]: You may be saying stupid stuff and you may be talking about something totally irrelevant

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.440
[Guest]: But the fact that you can and cannot is everything to your online personality. So I thought this is really

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.600
[Guest]: Interesting and very different part of our lives and i've been here before the internet

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.040
[Guest]: so

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.840
[Guest]: To have that that tool where you can all talk to all of these people and you can see all of these people

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.720
[Guest]: Was a big thing and then seeing it misused

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.360
[Guest]: From almost the get-go. So a little pre-history

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.040
[Guest]: When there was no facebook, no twitter

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:07.320
[Guest]: Pre-history when there was no facebook, no reddit people found ways to abuse each other on discussions about

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.940
[Guest]: compiler code and

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.640
[Guest]: Just on basic things where you wouldn't expect it. People can get very passionate and fight about that

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.560
[Guest]: and there's just tons and tons of

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.160
[Guest]: Stories from those days where people were looking at and they were going

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.400
[Guest]: Okay, that's really not what we expected people to do and that's sort of this

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.660
[Guest]: this apocryphal body of work

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:35.100
[Guest]: Before moderating became as and before the modern research started happening on it today

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.420
[Guest]: About what to do what rules should be applied to make a good conversation online

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.780
[Guest]: because when you went online you'd find that a lot of people would just

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.860
[Guest]: Like if you had a topic on religion or politics, they would get very ugly

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:55.020
[Guest]: So actually let's move back. Have you ever heard of the term eternal september? No. No, tell me about it. So eternal september is one of those

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.740
[Guest]: Those those terms which encompass the whole idea like signal versus noise

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.140
[Guest]: And this is part of that

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.780
[Guest]: Those terms which people use to be frank moderating is not very researched as a science or anything right now

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.700
[Guest]: But a lot more work is going into understanding how we interact online

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.580
[Guest]: But before that there were terms like eternal september

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.740
[Guest]: eternal september

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:22.300
[Guest]: There was a forum called usenet a bunch of forums called usenet. This is around the 1990s and a little earlier than that

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.900
[Guest]: and

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.140
[Guest]: The general pattern was that there were a bunch of people out there who were familiar who knew had a certain

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.300
[Guest]: General code of how to communicate and talk to each other every so often in the year

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.100
[Guest]: There would be a new influx of users a periodic influx from a bunch of colleges where people came there

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.300
[Guest]: They now had access to usenet and they would come in

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.840
[Guest]: And that was generally called and that was usually in september and that period would be a period of adjustment

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.740
[Guest]: They would have to the new users would end up learning and imbibing the general rules of and code of conduct online

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.780
[Guest]: And the forums would continue in peace

00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:01.900
[Guest]: Except finally in one day in 1993 when AOL allowed all of its users to use and access usenet

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.660
[Guest]: And essentially there was a very large influx of users so large that the ability of the forums to

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:16.220
[Guest]: Condition and educate people on the ways they would people used to behave online disappeared. It was more than the old guard's ability to

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.500
[Guest]: help or guide people or

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.780
[Guest]: I

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.700
[Guest]: Don't know you could use any amount of words. You could even use indoctrinate if you're being very uncharitable

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.420
[Guest]: But it's not it was more like understanding how to talk to each other

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:36.060
[Guest]: And that was termed eternal september. That's a fantastic term and it's like we're still in an eternal september. Yes, it is

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.180
[Guest]: mostly it's the sort of most

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.460
[Guest]: horrifying version of eternal september you can think of because

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.760
[Guest]: Everyone's a kid online so to speak today. We've the rules of the house or general rules of decorum

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.600
[Guest]: Either seem to have been forgotten or they haven't been discovered by a vast majority of people

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.760
[Guest]: And it's very scary to think of and a large majority of india, which is not online yet

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.000
[Guest]: so those

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.400
[Guest]: Our way of communicating with each other is

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.000
[Guest]: Very important. Let's go back to the usenet days for a moment that then I assume that

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.160
[Amit Varma]: In those days you could say that whatever policing or moderation there was

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:21.280
[Amit Varma]: Was not like overt moderation. It was more just a community sort of thing where the communities were small enough

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.760
[Amit Varma]: that you figured out what are the acceptable ways of

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.440
[Amit Varma]: You know conversing with other people the acceptable behaviors and you quickly adapted to them and and

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.720
[Amit Varma]: That was manageable every september when a small bunch of new people

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:38.160
[Amit Varma]: Came in and they quickly learned and those who didn't learn went and those who learned stayed on and so on

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.760
[Amit Varma]: Went and those who learned stayed on and became stalwarts and then suddenly one day it all opens up and it's a free-for-all and

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:50.000
[Amit Varma]: Everyone is sort of there. So how did how did the various forums then sort of start adjusting to it?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean there would have been what were the different schools of thought on this we should do nothing

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.160
[Amit Varma]: We should you know police it in this way. We should police it in that way. So

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.080
[Guest]: This is going really back and internet time so before there were very large

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.840
[Guest]: Social media sites and aggregators like facebook. I think the most places that I would go to were forums and

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:17.040
[Guest]: You would tend so there would be some technical forums game forums were quite popular and all these tended to have a small community

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.160
[Guest]: So it's quite easy to understand the general rules

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.000
[Guest]: and

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
[Guest]: the general code of conduct

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:31.120
[Guest]: The moderators that I knew at that time generally didn't have to moderate for content or quantity or policy

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.120
[Guest]: and

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:39.280
[Guest]: Yes, there would inevitably be some someone or the other who would try and attack the forum or try to attack users

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.760
[Guest]: And those people tended to get banned and there are a lot of stories of even back then of how that

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.440
[Guest]: That those halcyon days were even filled with problems and issues

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.800
[Guest]: But nothing at I think at the scale at which we're dealing with now

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.160
[Guest]: So for example back at that time one of the biggest problems you would always face was spam

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:02.880
[Guest]: You would have someone or some robot which would come online and just constantly spam you so those basic spam filters would deal with it

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:09.680
[Guest]: But then there were also some users who for some reason decided it was their life's mission to harass either the entire forum

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:16.480
[Guest]: Or harass a specific user and that would be something which moderators of old would try and go and weed out and ban

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.240
[Guest]: but

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.920
[Guest]: Even in that time there were issues of groups of people targeting each other

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.040
[Guest]: So for example, a lot of forums find it their life's mission to oppose an idea

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.160
[Guest]: And then to oppose and attack everyone who embodies that idea very famously would be

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.960
[Guest]: a nazi supremacist forum finding jewish forums or even

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.240
[Guest]: Forums where people congregate for different reasons

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.840
[Guest]: around judaism and attack the users over there

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.920
[Guest]: so

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.840
[Guest]: Even before reddit and before many of the other of facebook people

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.680
[Guest]: Were finding ways to harass and weaponize speech online

00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:00.320
[Guest]: What's happened? So the next major website I remember i'm going to was a technical website called slash.dot

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.400
[Guest]: This was

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.760
[Guest]: It was very interesting because everyone could upvote all their topics

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.760
[Guest]: and

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.560
[Guest]: When you upvoted a topic you had different criteria on which you could upvote it. You could say it was insightful

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.480
[Guest]: It was funny instead of having a generic like or dislike button

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.840
[Guest]: There was different varieties on ways you could upvote and you could say this person's contributing to the conversation

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.120
[Amit Varma]: And slash.dot if I remember had a huge number of users

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:31.120
[Amit Varma]: So you actually got a very good sample size of these different kinds of upvotes and downvotes for it to be meaningful

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:38.240
[Guest]: Yes, and around that time what people started discussing was the concept of signal versus noise

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.600
[Guest]: So that was the realization that not all conversation online is on topic

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.960
[Guest]: And not all conversation online is as insightful as

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.960
[Guest]: Listening to the most intelligent person on that topic speak

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.320
[Guest]: So that's signal versus noise is sort of the other

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.240
[Guest]: major way people explain the issues online that

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.720
[Guest]: you have

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.520
[Guest]: Lots and lots of people talking not all of it is worthwhile

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:09.680
[Guest]: The question which then started bothering me is that how do you get the most useful information to come up?

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:18.320
[Guest]: And sadly, it turns out that even a voting system like what slash.dot used where you could say that this comment is insightful

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.960
[Guest]: And this comment is funny or this comment is interesting did not necessarily make it such

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.280
[Guest]: That the most useful or relevant information came up most often

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.400
[Guest]: The most popular opinion still managed to be heard

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.360
[Guest]: And this is generally going to be the theme

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.040
[Guest]: Of what we see with interactions online

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.240
[Guest]: That it's just sheer numbers which tend to influence

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.000
[Guest]: how

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.640
[Guest]: We end up talking and what we end up talking about

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.980
[Amit Varma]: And like I remember I started my blog India Uncut in 2003-2004

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.400
[Amit Varma]: And after a while, I found that my traffic was too much for me to have comments enabled

00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.720
[Amit Varma]: Because again, I couldn't handle the noise to signal ratio and I figured out rather than try and moderate or keep an eye on it

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.480
[Amit Varma]: Or whatever. I simply won't have comments because it's it is after all my style

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.480
[Amit Varma]: and

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:12.560
[Amit Varma]: You know save myself that mental bandwidth and I remember chatting with a friend of mine who ran a blog called Sepia Mutiny

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.120
[Amit Varma]: a very fine blog

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.120
[Amit Varma]: you know desi americans and

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.680
[Amit Varma]: One of the guys who started that was a chap called Manish Vedge

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.040
[Amit Varma]: And Manish once told me when he spoke about his comments policy

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.400
[Amit Varma]: And I was always very surprised because they had they also had very decent traffic

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.680
[Amit Varma]: But their comment section was always pretty good and he said oh we ban liberally and we don't just ban for trolling or abuse

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:38.640
[Amit Varma]: We ban for stupidity. Yes, which uh, you know brings an interesting question of even when you talk about signal and noise

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.520
[Amit Varma]: there are many categories of noise and there is a certain subjectivity to it and

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.320
[Amit Varma]: The hard part for a moderator then becomes where do you draw the line? You don't want to you know

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.600
[Amit Varma]: Have commenters or readers feeling that shit

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.880
[Amit Varma]: This is only meant to be an echo chamber for people who agree with this guy

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.440
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time you do want to weed out bad behavior. And is it an issue sort of

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.040
[Amit Varma]: Finding those boundaries defining those boundaries have they changed over time?

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.520
[Guest]: So yes in general there is an issue quite often finding boundaries

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.360
[Guest]: Mostly because as you as you asked yes boundaries move

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.280
[Guest]: so

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:20.320
[Guest]: In general the way i've approached or what i've been exposed to has almost always been dominated by the uh,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.080
[Guest]: General american viewpoint that free speech is critical and free speech is good

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:30.240
[Guest]: And that the more free speech the better chances for drowning out bad ideas

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.760
[Guest]: This was the general philosophy which which is why even on reddit. There's always been

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.960
[Guest]: Such a pushback against moderation where

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:45.280
[Guest]: Where what your friend did is turns out to be probably one of the only ways to deal with it and what you did

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:51.760
[Guest]: Is turning out increasingly to be the only way for people to deal with conversations. There are many very large websites, which have entirely

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.120
[Guest]: Shut down their comment section may be mistaken, but I believe either a scientific american or a major

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.080
[Guest]: Website has shut down their comment section

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.080
[Guest]: because

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.320
[Guest]: It's a bit sad, but people don't interact

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.120
[Guest]: In ways which are healthy

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.680
[Guest]: Or in the best spirit of humanity

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:15.760
[Guest]: So to go with an example of what happens when I ended up moderating on reddit

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.560
[Guest]: It was after the forum was actually dealing with such thing when the forum which was created was very small

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.760
[Guest]: And it was built on that principle that let everyone speak let everyone share ideas no matter how good bad or ugly

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.320
[Guest]: And deal with the bad ideas

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.360
[Guest]: Unfortunately, it turns out that since your entire existence online is wrong

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.040
[Guest]: Words are also very literally violence online. You can

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:44.240
[Guest]: Gang up on a person and prevent them from speaking. You can compress their ideas and you can move them away

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:52.160
[Guest]: You can form the internet really helps people find each other and this also means making lots and lots of ideological ghettos

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.200
[Guest]: So that process and those ghettos more are quite common in the internet

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:05.120
[Guest]: What would happen on the forum is that if someone had an opposing viewpoint, they would get relentlessly hounded and since everyone was expected to behave on their own

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.360
[Guest]: In whatever manner was befitting them

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.400
[Guest]: Well, since no one was stopping them they behaved in any which way they liked which would quite often just be straight-up harassment

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.960
[Guest]: If you're a woman online, it's not a good scene. It's very very bad

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.120
[Guest]: People would find them if by chance you let them in and you let them in and you let them in

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:27.440
[Guest]: If you're a woman online, it's not a good scene. It's very very bad. People would find them if by chance you let people know

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:32.400
[Guest]: You're a woman online then you would be targeted you would be targeted all throughout the web and you would be harassed

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.400
[Amit Varma]: What is sort of the men to women ratio in a place like Reddit for example?

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.600
[Amit Varma]: In terms of active commenters, do you have any idea?

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.760
[Amit Varma]: No idea because you'd imagine that it would become a sort of a vicious circle where

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.800
[Amit Varma]: Women just don't feel welcome because there are so many men many of them abusive and therefore they just don't bother to

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.380
[Guest]: Participate and I'm very certain that's the case and I'm sure

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:57.260
[Guest]: Most people who go and interact out there either choose places where they are welcome

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.860
[Guest]: Right, or they have a very thick skin or they just avoid they come to those places

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.940
[Guest]: where they know these conversations can happen and either try to engage or

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.100
[Guest]: I'm or they

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.220
[Guest]: Ignore those conversations focus on the parts which can be useful. But

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:18.540
[Guest]: For the exact ratio. I don't know and knowing in itself would bother me because that would be mean that there's some way to

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:24.060
[Amit Varma]: Identify who's who yeah, exactly. Oh, so, you know, i'm not a reddit user per se once in a while

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.260
[Amit Varma]: I'll see a link and go and I really like the keto subreddit which

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.360
[Amit Varma]: Is a fantastic subreddit and i'm of course a keto evangelizer

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:37.820
[Amit Varma]: So here's what it seems to me reddit's fundamental problem is let me just articulate this and tell me if i've got it

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:41.100
[Amit Varma]: Right that on the one hand it is true that

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:47.420
[Amit Varma]: Freedom of speech is something that really applies to a state acting against the citizens and if you are like a private

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.180
[Amit Varma]: Party like a website you have the right to set whatever rules you want

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:56.620
[Amit Varma]: And if people don't abide by those rules, they can go elsewhere or you can ban them or moderate them

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.340
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, you deem fit and therefore people shouldn't really complain

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.860
[Amit Varma]: But the other way of looking at it is that community sites like reddit and facebook

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:10.620
[Amit Varma]: Are so large and all-encompassing that for many people they are the world where they exist

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:16.860
[Amit Varma]: And to stop somebody from expressing herself in a world like this would be very cruel

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:21.740
[Amit Varma]: Among other things and the idea you mentioned of letting free speech prevail

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.020
[Amit Varma]: I mean one of the fundamental defenses of free speech

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:31.740
[Amit Varma]: Comes from the phrase a marketplace of ideas that to get to whatever the truth might be on any subject at all

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.580
[Amit Varma]: You have to let

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:39.100
[Amit Varma]: All ideas find expression and then let whichever ideas win out in the marketplace of ideas

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:43.740
[Amit Varma]: That's that's really the function but you can't stop anyone from speaking which is the original intention

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.700
[Amit Varma]: But uh, and that's reddit's dilemma that because of the noise to signal ratio

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:53.340
[Amit Varma]: It must moderate but at the same time there are huge costs to

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.900
[Amit Varma]: uh moderating both philosophically in terms of the principle of free speech

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:03.500
[Amit Varma]: And also practically in terms of what it can mean for users for whom reddit is a whole world

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.980
[Guest]: Right, I agree. So

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.060
[Guest]: funnily

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.700
[Guest]: One part of the internet which did work

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:17.020
[Guest]: I used this idea recently and someone challenged it with a far more sophisticated, uh approach. They linked to an old

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.180
[Guest]: uh

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.660
[Guest]: I think us supreme court or us court, uh,

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:28.140
[Guest]: or a law journal where they discuss this idea and the limitations on uh, how well the free speech the

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.500
[Guest]: marketplace of ideas as an idea itself works

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.340
[Guest]: and

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.420
[Guest]: For one I like the analogy. It's very simple

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:40.700
[Guest]: I like the marketplace of idea because it gets the idea across what we're really trying to do where we're trying to share ideas

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.620
[Guest]: But there are a lot of things which are automatically limited

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:48.380
[Guest]: So it's not that all speeches you're allowed to say fire shout fire or in a crowded. Uh,

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.660
[Guest]: Theater, you're not we don't have unlimited free speech

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.740
[Guest]: anyway, and if you're in india, there are a lot of topics which you cannot speak about because

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:00.220
[Guest]: If you do and you talk about them in a certain way, you will cause harm to others

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.540
[Guest]: And the state has decided that that's not okay

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:07.260
[Guest]: Okay, in general there are certain ideas which we do not discuss in our marketplaces

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.780
[Amit Varma]: I think if I can just i've uh, you know

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.060
[Amit Varma]: The shouted shouting uh fire in a crowded theater analogy is actually

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.540
[Amit Varma]: One that I don't agree with and i've written a column about this

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.980
[Amit Varma]: In fact a couple of columns it's it bugs me a lot when people use it

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:23.740
[Amit Varma]: Because here's the thing if you shout fire in a crowded theater if the patron does it when there's no fire

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:30.700
[Amit Varma]: He's defrauding his customers if a customer does it he is in a sense defrauding the patron and he's disrupting

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:35.980
[Amit Varma]: Uh all the other people who have uh, you know paid for a good experience, which is being disrupted

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:40.300
[Amit Varma]: So on all of these grounds you can condemn that behavior and stop it

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:44.220
[Amit Varma]: You don't need to it's not an attack on free speech to do so per se

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:49.580
[Amit Varma]: If someone shouts fire in a crowded theater, there are various grounds including property rights

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.140
[Amit Varma]: uh and contracts on which you can actually prosecute him and

00:24:54.140 --> 00:25:00.140
[Amit Varma]: Punish him. I mean i'm a i'm a free speech absolutist as you would have figured but I keep pointing out that we're going to have fun

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.620
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but I keep pointing out that uh, you know

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:07.580
[Amit Varma]: My my free speech absolutism really comes down to how the state deals with the citizens

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.020
[Amit Varma]: Uh, because I believe the citizen should be in charge and not the state

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.780
[Amit Varma]: And people seem to have the opposite view as a default

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.140
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't apply to how a private entity like reddit

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.980
[Amit Varma]: Deals with its users because as far as I can see reddit has its terms of use

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.980
[Amit Varma]: And those terms of use obviously include things like you shall not do ad homonyms

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.460
[Amit Varma]: And you shall not abuse and you shall all of those things

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:34.460
[Amit Varma]: And they are entirely within their rights to kick out any users who have signed that terms of those terms of use and don't comply

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:39.820
[Amit Varma]: So to me, that's not so much a free speech issue in the classical sense of the term

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:47.020
[Guest]: So I too started out from the position of view that free speech is that my driving force has been to figure out what works

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:52.860
[Guest]: Figure out what works and i've come to the conclusion that if you if you use the analogy of the marketplace of ideas

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.300
[Guest]: A lot of things don't work

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:58.620
[Guest]: The big issue is that a lot of people can get together and suppress a good idea

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.380
[Guest]: So a lot of people want to get together and they want to suppress discussion on

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.380
[Guest]: Uh racism, for example

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:11.260
[Guest]: They want to suppress certain discussion on religion or they want to specifically focus discussion on xyz topic about a different religion

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.380
[Guest]: and these things these the previous

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:20.140
[Guest]: This protection and the shield which we had in the previous era was that these things were very amorphous. They were

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.620
[Guest]: not necessarily something you could

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:30.880
[Guest]: Tangibly see but as a moderator or as a user online these things happen every day now because all your interactions are about conversation

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:38.460
[Guest]: You can end up spamming the feed you can keep or you can very subtly ensure that certain conversations get

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.280
[Guest]: Downvoted and disappear whereas other conversations which you prefer get or get upvoted

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.600
[Guest]: so it's now more a question of

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.240
[Guest]: whether the original idea of

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:54.720
[Guest]: The original conception of this marketplace where everyone gets together and share ideas is still working and in the new era

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.520
[Guest]: It's not practically speaking. There are many ways in which

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.240
[Guest]: Free speech as we knew it. It's

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.200
[Amit Varma]: Done and dusted. I think you can argue though. I agree with you, but as a counter you could argue that

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.720
[Amit Varma]: The marketplace of ideas was always extremely slow to work

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:14.800
[Amit Varma]: For example, if you had read it in say 1820 in America and someone said slavery is bad and we should abolish it

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:20.480
[Amit Varma]: the same thing would happen to them what you just described that the majority of people would just download them and

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.440
[Amit Varma]: Shout them out or troll them or whatever and it wouldn't matter and it would seem as if in the marketplace of ideas

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:32.400
[Amit Varma]: Pro-slavery has won and then society sort of took its own time to change gradually. So it's never immediate

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.960
[Amit Varma]: But the whole idea I think of the marketplace of ideas is that at least those ideas are allowed to exist in some form

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.000
[Guest]: right, this is the marketplace of ideas if I remember correct that actually what you said is a sort of uh,

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.520
[Guest]: One of the criticisms of the original concept and said that there's never really been a functional marketplace in the first place

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:54.240
[Guest]: Because there are several concepts which are as it is banned by the states or controlled by the states. You cannot discuss them libel

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.480
[Guest]: So, um, there are certain topics which the majority will automatically take a stand on

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.960
[Amit Varma]: I think india is very harsh and unduly harsh on free speech

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.840
[Amit Varma]: But in the us the first amendment is really quite excellent

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.720
[Guest]: I think in terms it is and finally the the person who was criticizing the concept of

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.000
[Guest]: free speech and the marketplace of ideas was a

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.440
[Guest]: Person in on an american law journal, right?

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.840
[Guest]: So there are limitations

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.160
[Guest]: No idea is perfect and you don't deal with platonic ideas in the first place and there will always be

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.520
[Guest]: the thing which was most critical to me to realize was

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.240
[Guest]: That when you started out putting rules in our forum, we said basic rules. Don't harass

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.000
[Guest]: don't

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.160
[Guest]: Hunt people and don't go and be abusive very simple straightforward rules

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.240
[Guest]: And then what would happen is that once those rules?

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.720
[Guest]: got in place

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:48.880
[Guest]: And people became familiar with them they go and we banned several users and said no you cannot behave this way

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.580
[Guest]: You cannot just intentionally put insightful material. You cannot intentionally go and find this particular

00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:00.880
[Guest]: Uh subgroup of people you don't like for example furries and decide you want to just abuse them. That's just not okay

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.280
[Guest]: There's no reason for you to use our forum to just harass furries

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:11.200
[Guest]: It's not something which we really care about and we're not going to give you a space to do that because that's

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:16.400
[Guest]: Goes and causes other problems. It makes other people upset and it just starts a chain reaction. Absolutely

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.280
[Guest]: So that's one of the things where I agree with your friend that yes

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.920
[Guest]: You need to you end up coming to a position where you have to use the ban hammer very often

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.160
[Guest]: and our first attempts were very

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:32.560
[Guest]: Distant and practical. We said we will generally use it and as little as we can and for the most egregious violations

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.560
[Guest]: But what happens is when you move the frontier

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.160
[Guest]: You have a new level of peace. You have no longer the same kind of horrendous things happening as before

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.720
[Guest]: But then what happens?

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.600
[Guest]: People find new ways to abuse that they find

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.360
[Guest]: So the term which I love about this is fractal stupidity

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.600
[Guest]: It once you've established a set of ground rules

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.560
[Guest]: They find that they can tweak these particular ground rules or they can find another way to harass someone

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:03.280
[Guest]: They can just follow someone and constantly repeat certain things which are not offensive, but are

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:08.640
[Guest]: Either dog whistles or either just slanted the right way to read as offensive

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.160
[Guest]: Or they can constantly tag a user in a conversation. There are many ways in which give me an example of this

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.720
[Guest]: all right, so

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.720
[Guest]: Once we've banned a lot of this behavior

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:25.520
[Guest]: There were people who would find ways to show up in conversations about XYZ subgroup and say well

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:30.080
[Guest]: These people have always done this what you expect and it wouldn't be outright offensive

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.880
[Guest]: They wouldn't be saying these people need to die. They would always be saying something which was polite and

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:41.200
[Guest]: Obviously rude and now that was a problem for us because now they no longer we we were used to the old

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:46.400
[Guest]: Frontier, which was straight-up death threats hate speech abuse here. They're not saying anything wrong

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.640
[Guest]: They're using plain simple English and they're saying something which when translated is obviously offensive

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.280
[Guest]: But we had restricted ourselves because of our previous rules

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:57.760
[Guest]: We said we would not deal with something and we would not ban someone or harm someone for saying such things

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.560
[Guest]: We would only ban them if they said and outrightly hateful things

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.600
[Guest]: So now what do we do with this because this is obviously wrong

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.320
[Guest]: And we were constrained and we knew that so finally this we let it go

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:13.280
[Guest]: Eventually this became the new rule and then finally we had to come up with a new set of rules

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:19.280
[Guest]: And then finally we had to come up with a new set of rules because a lot of the users said that is obviously an attack

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.120
[Guest]: Right, you need to deal with it. And so the frontier moved

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:29.840
[Guest]: And you keep moving the frontier forward and forward. Yes, and this causes a lot of pain as the frontier moves is the

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:35.200
[Guest]: Advance of complexity. So first you're just this really simple line. Don't abuse each other now

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.120
[Guest]: you have this new line which says

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.200
[Guest]: You really can't use these particular types of abuse and you can't use this particular type of abuse

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.520
[Guest]: And then some guy will say that guy is doing that. Why are you stopping me from saying this?

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.520
[Guest]: So now you get the advent of lawyers

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.120
[Guest]: Reddit lawyers

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.920
[Guest]: They go through your rules and they say that person broke that rule by just that square inch and you banned him

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:56.800
[Guest]: Why?

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.040
[Guest]: Or they'll say you stopped me from making this post and see all of these people are saying all of these horrible things

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.440
[Guest]: They're not saying horrible things. They're saying things which that person thinks is horrible and he's saying you're lying them

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.640
[Amit Varma]: Why aren't you lying me?

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:13.120
[Amit Varma]: So just as the members are in a sense at the mercy of the moderators are the moderators also being constantly held accountable by the members

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:19.200
[Guest]: They are but at the end of the day the moderators have far more power and they can eventually stop paying attention

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.600
[Guest]: and so

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.320
[Guest]: Actually, that's not true

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.840
[Guest]: the moderators cannot really be held in the same way users can be

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.360
[Guest]: Because at the end of the day moderators enjoy a significant amount of power

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.680
[Guest]: And a certain amount of opacity

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.720
[Amit Varma]: Of their actions and do moderators like argue with each other about where the line should be and where in my team

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.720
[Guest]: Yes in a certain extent in our team

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.480
[Guest]: We have attempted to keep that sort of different set of ideologies alive

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:48.800
[Guest]: but what we are finding is that the older set of moderators who still remember the old free speech days are

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.240
[Guest]: Increasingly a more quiet bunch and the newer moderators

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:57.600
[Guest]: Especially ones who are having uh more experience from a lot of the other forums and so on are very clear that yes

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.120
[Guest]: These are the only things that work

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:04.080
[Amit Varma]: You're not going to have a conversation and you need to get rid of the new moderators are not reinventing the wheel

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:10.160
[Amit Varma]: But they're also discovering new kinds of behavior, which they have figured out how to deal with. Yeah, so there are

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.080
[Guest]: depending upon the size of your subreddit the type of interactions you have can be

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.160
[Guest]: Very minor or they can be a very massive amount of interactions

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:23.200
[Guest]: For example our keto doesn't have that many subscribers compared to a subreddit like world news

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:29.520
[Guest]: And world news or has to have its own stable of moderators to deal with it because a lot of the topics out there can

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.100
[Guest]: attract

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:35.280
[Guest]: Emotions from every corner of the world and they really need to be on the ball with figuring out

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.680
[Guest]: What the hell is acceptable or not?

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.320
[Guest]: But our keto on the other hand is what I'd call a topic constrained forum

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:47.360
[Guest]: People go there because they want something to do they want to figure out how to get their keto diet working

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:52.320
[Guest]: They want to showcase their successes. I think these forums in general are one of the few places which work

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:58.640
[Guest]: Because they are what I prefer calling them this sort of vector quantity. There is a start point and a direction, right?

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:05.140
[Guest]: Whereas other con topics which are just general where people can come in and discuss politics and religion almost inevitably

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.240
[Guest]: follow a very sad path of

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.640
[Guest]: Polarization anger and fighting and then heavy moderation if any

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.920
[Amit Varma]: So Nikhil tell me something in all these years that you've been

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.720
[Amit Varma]: First a user and then a moderator and so on how have online conversations changed?

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.160
[Guest]: So when I would go to forums initially, it was not

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.440
[Guest]: That trivial and it was very hard for people to find these places

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.640
[Guest]: You would either be a gamer or you would be a technical person and you would find these things

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:38.480
[Guest]: And so you people tended to be in communities, which they already knew about but once you had facebook and twitter and reddit

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:45.120
[Guest]: Then it became far larger aggregations and youtube comments. So what we I started noticing is that

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:50.080
[Guest]: In my bubble where I where people would rather use full sentences. It was

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:57.600
[Guest]: People tried to be civil but then as more and more people just started coming on online people quite often didn't have the same

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.240
[Guest]: uh

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.600
[Guest]: Reasons or need to talk in the same manner. So you started having

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:11.280
[Guest]: Far your word length or questions would go down the topics change people generally quite often just like shooting the shit. So a lot of

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:16.480
[Guest]: um general time pass because I guess less personal connect because of larger groups

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.000
[Guest]: So therefore and also a lot of topics which were just for fun

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.120
[Guest]: like general

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:25.520
[Guest]: So one of the big things which you find in a lot of forums and what you need to actually where a lot of the rules

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.680
[Guest]: Start coming out is just jokes

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.040
[Guest]: Because people online if you're going to a serious discussion

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.360
[Guest]: There are a lot of people who don't really have anything to contribute

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.280
[Guest]: They're there to watch but they feel an urge to go and say something funny or to say some

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:44.180
[Guest]: They find something amusing and that's usually the most common content which you tend to have to moderate out of existence

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.200
[Guest]: You have to say okay, no jokes. That's pretty cruel

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.480
[Guest]: So you'll find that jokes perform so well

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.880
[Guest]: Because it's so easy for everyone to get

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.680
[Guest]: That they used to go and they would end up crushing the rest of the more insightful comments

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.520
[Guest]: So the longest hardest to read comment is the one which very few people would read

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.120
[Guest]: And the more funny simpler comment would be the one which is on top

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:10.880
[Guest]: So that I observed you could see that effect of how just easy to consume material would dominate

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.880
[Guest]: And you'd see that not just in the comments

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.480
[Guest]: You saw you started seeing that in content and then you saw the buzzfeeds of the world

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.840
[Guest]: You saw how all of them worked

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.920
[Guest]: You saw how people understood memes in a very deep and fundamental way

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:27.200
[Amit Varma]: And all of this would also then become a disincentive for the more serious comment and would have a chilling effect on the deeper stuff

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:27.680
[Guest]: Absolutely

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.960
[Guest]: So you would have to make very serious efforts to

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:36.560
[Guest]: To let that part of your garden grow because it turns out jokes and memes are sort of like weeds

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.760
[Guest]: They're very hardy

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.040
[Guest]: They can get into your brain

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:44.080
[Guest]: They can stick there and they can dominate your short-term memory and even your long-term memory and in the sense that

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.600
[Guest]: Well, they don't dominate a long term. They'll dominate your short term, but

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:55.120
[Amit Varma]: They end up crowding out everything else and also I mean, I've seen an analog of this in twitter where the most common mode of

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Expression on twitter is snark because it's so easy to be snarky about someone

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.840
[Amit Varma]: oh, yeah, you know someone says something you don't agree with you make a one-line joke and you mock him and

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:09.520
[Amit Varma]: 50 people RT you and everybody's oh you're so witty while you actually didn't address the argument at all

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.920
[Amit Varma]: you just said something supposedly witty and

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.480
[Guest]: Because that's just easy to consume I think that analogy with junk food

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.640
[Guest]: This is just so easy to get it may not answer the question may not deal with the issue

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.320
[Guest]: But you read it you got it you figured out the positions you felt happy

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.760
[Guest]: You got you got some superficial understanding of the matter and you're on your way

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.520
[Guest]: And you stuff your face with it and you feel good and I'll give you an even more fascinating way that

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.480
[Guest]: People are using this to spam accounts. So this this is a bit different and a little off topic

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.920
[Guest]: so today recently someone pointed out what's happening on reddit is that

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.360
[Guest]: People are trying to create authentic looking accounts

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.080
[Guest]: So that they can use those accounts later on when a crisis occurs or they want to mold opinion

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:52.000
[Guest]: So a lot of forums now have and a lot of subreddits have blockers

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.400
[Guest]: They say that if you are not an authentic account with so many years of age and so many comment points

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.720
[Guest]: You are probably a fake account. So you are not allowed to post you have to get your score up

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.840
[Guest]: And then you can post it's just sort of a are you human test?

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.760
[Guest]: So what they're doing now these guys these they write a program

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.520
[Guest]: They look at us they look at maybe our keto or our cooking. They see one of the most popular topics

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.840
[Guest]: They see what the title was

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.400
[Guest]: They wait a little while they recreate that topic

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.920
[Guest]: Because now they know they at what time to post it and whether that's going to get up and it's performed well before

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.760
[Guest]: So now when this gets posted it will perform well again, so they get a lot of points

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.240
[Guest]: Then they look at whichever the most popular comments

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.480
[Guest]: Someone had written over there whatever the top most funny comment was and they recreate that verbatim

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.400
[Guest]: They just copy paste that so it looks like a really funny insightful article by someone with a very funny insightful top comment

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.120
[Amit Varma]: And people like oh, hey, that's really funny and they will upvote it

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.240
[Amit Varma]: And is someone gaming the system and this could easily be russian bots in the future

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.160
[Guest]: It's just advertisers matter of fact

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.960
[Guest]: They have one bot make this they have another bot come in and put the funny comment and then they have another bot

00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:00.320
[Guest]: Respond to that comment and people just read it and they think it's two natural people talking to each other

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:07.920
[Guest]: So they just keep upvoting it and they just farm enough credibility copying human content or the most popular content

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:13.200
[Guest]: Regurgitating it and people find it always funny and they keep upvoting it

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:19.360
[Amit Varma]: This creates a and does this mean that overall the more serious minded people stop taking part?

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.800
[Amit Varma]: Right, it's in a sense a selection process for the crap

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.840
[Guest]: Yeah in some ways so all the serious people end up moving on to more serious discussion forums

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.080
[Guest]: Where the topic is meant to be?

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.800
[Guest]: More slow or more and handled in depth and you'll see a lot of those forums have far less communication

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.400
[Guest]: There are fewer topics which are discussed or people have fewer comments

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.560
[Guest]: They tend to read or they tend to discuss or there's a way to figure out people who are

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.920
[Guest]: Bullshitting versus the people who are actually serious about the topic

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:52.640
[Guest]: So for example, if you're talking about economics, there are forums where people can just bullshit all day about it

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.400
[Guest]: But then there's a certain sub forum

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:59.200
[Guest]: On just economics where they spend all their time arguing what is bad economics or not

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.360
[Guest]: And over there if you post something and you want to make your own post on it

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.720
[Guest]: You have to give a reason with a full-fledged explanation as to why

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.960
[Guest]: What you are talking about is an example of bad economics and you have to dice

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:16.240
[Guest]: It's essentially a short dissertation and then people decide whether that's actually passes the rule

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:21.520
[Guest]: If so, it's allowed your post is allowed to be kept. Otherwise, it's removed and that's a test

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:26.400
[Guest]: It's essentially this proof of intelligence test, which a lot of forums have to do now

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.760
[Amit Varma]: So that's kind of a long tail of content in a sense though that you you know, the

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.040
[Amit Varma]: Adaptation even the very intelligent will find their niche where they are comfortable and they are not crowded out

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.640
[Amit Varma]: But those will be very small niches and right won't have an impact on the overall discourse

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:43.600
[Guest]: Correct because unless you even knew it existed you wouldn't go there and the topics quite often over there are very arcane

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:50.720
[Guest]: And they're discussing, for example, our bad economics will discuss the very fine-tuned details about x y z

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:56.560
[Guest]: Predictor of let's say the gender wage gap and they have a huge document on it

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.680
[Guest]: And frankly, most people will never go through it

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.680
[Guest]: So whenever the topic of gender wages come up or gender disparities come up

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.840
[Guest]: No one will have recourse to that information and the conversations will be dominated

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:12.000
[Guest]: The public perception and the popular perception will be dominated by the media

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.280
[Guest]: Popular perception will be dominated by the easier to consume concepts the hard ideological positions and the performative propaganda

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.080
[Guest]: All will disappear

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:24.800
[Guest]: So unless you have an easy way to package something or put an idea that will dominate

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.040
[Guest]: Whether it's right or wrong is a different issue

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:33.120
[Guest]: Whether if it's easy to consume and share and it sounds right for the zeitgeist at the time that will usually work

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:39.120
[Amit Varma]: And what is it about like when did you see this change happening more and more becoming dominant?

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:45.200
[Amit Varma]: Like I remember back from my days of blogging in the second half of the last decade, you know 2005 onwards

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:50.000
[Amit Varma]: There was an oyster signal ratio problem and so on but things hadn't come this far

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Uh, is there a point where you can say that? Okay, this was a trigger

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.880
[Amit Varma]: This is when you know, maybe when facebook passed a certain critical mass or to be honest

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.600
[Guest]: I really can't recognize the point. It just constantly feels that we've been iterating our way forward

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.360
[Guest]: I can't find a moment where I can say. Okay, this is disturbing

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.080
[Guest]: I can see moments where new ideas were

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.700
[Guest]: uh discovered where new

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:18.500
[Guest]: Advances were done in design for applications. I can remember the point where people said. Oh, we have we should incorporate

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:19.900
[Guest]: uh

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.740
[Guest]: Behavioral psychology in our design for applications

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.980
[Guest]: I can remember when people said we should a b test websites to make them more interesting

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.340
[Guest]: But this the way conversations online has changed

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.820
[Guest]: Like really struggled to figure out a moment when I said this happened or this changed it

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:41.380
[Guest]: There there are many serious events which have happened online in facebook on reddit where people's perception changed

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:46.740
[Guest]: But it feels that in some way we've been just inching forward where teams of people have been trying to figure out ways to deal

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:51.780
[Guest]: With this problem. They've been figuring out a patch. They've been deploying it and then we deal with the next problem

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:56.260
[Amit Varma]: We discover so as a civilization. We've kind of been bringing it in here. Yeah

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:01.780
[Guest]: Yeah, it from from a moderator perspective. It very much feels that we've been winging it and now hey here we are

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:05.780
[Guest]: And everyone suddenly realized this is not necessarily a great place to be

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:11.140
[Amit Varma]: Okay, so i'm now going to uh cycle into the specific and ask you some questions about your time as a

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.140
[Amit Varma]: Reddit moderator, but first we'll take a short 60 second break

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:22.340

[Unknown]: It's been a great week on ivm and we hope that you can check out as many of these shows as you can

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.460
[Unknown]: And now let me get you onto your show

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:19.220
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen i'm with nikhil a moderator at reddit

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:24.980
[Amit Varma]: Who is not only talking to me about the evolution of human conversations online in his experience?

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:29.060
[Amit Varma]: as a user of forums like usenet and later reddit, but

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:36.260
[Amit Varma]: Also from a point of view of what it's doing to us as a society and us as individuals

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.060
[Amit Varma]: But nikhil, let me take you back to the sort of the granular

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:44.260
[Guest]: Details of your life at reddit. What is a moderator's day like small clarification?

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:49.860
[Guest]: I wish I was on usenet but sadly I didn't have internet at that time. You were too young. I was too young, right?

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:56.340
[Guest]: So, uh, what day-to-day life on moderator? Yeah, what is it like? Very boring. We are the janitors of the world

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:01.540
[Guest]: And unfortunate and very strangely very powerful janitors according to a lot of people

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:06.420
[Guest]: So our first set of rules which we came up on our forum was generally don't do harm

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:11.380
[Guest]: So a lot of it was sort of going through a bunch of posts and a bunch of comments

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:17.860
[Guest]: And if we saw someone say something which was genuinely hurtful or untowards or basically hate speech or racism

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.540
[Guest]: We would remove it

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.180
[Guest]: And then if that person was a repeat user if they did it once or twice

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:26.820
[Amit Varma]: We would have to go so there is a way to see if the person has been has that comment deleted before

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:33.060
[Guest]: We can so at the infancy of reddit when moderating really started off. They weren't really a set of tools

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.940
[Guest]: So a lot of very interesting things that happened as a result of this there was

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:40.260
[Guest]: So one of the really cool things about subreddit one of its of reddit is subreddits

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.280
[Guest]: And I think that's one of its great contributions

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:46.440
[Guest]: To how we talk online so you can have a subreddit called r-pictures

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:53.780
[Guest]: And r-pictures has a lot of people and they were sharing everything and a lot of people started sharing cat pictures or memes

00:45:54.500 --> 00:46:00.660
[Guest]: And those ended up dominating. So then what someone did is they created a separate subreddit for memes

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:06.740
[Guest]: And that took off and then the people at r-pics said if you're putting a meme you can't put it here put it there

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:10.820
[Guest]: So that split the load and that's a really fascinating thing which made it very easy

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.340
[Guest]: For these guys to do that before that you couldn't really do it as easily in a forum

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:19.140
[Guest]: You didn't have you either went to a different forum to discuss cat pictures and a different forum to discuss memes

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:23.860
[Guest]: Or you came to sub or came to reddit and then someone made a new subreddit to discuss

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:29.940
[Guest]: This memes in general and you could go there you could go and just see all of those things and this actually happened

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:36.580
[Guest]: So r-pics split up into other meme subreddits and those meme subreddits in turn split up into other subreddits

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.740
[Guest]: There's from there. There's actually a subreddit just dedicated to the insanity wolf meme

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:46.820
[Guest]: And there's another really interesting feature which used to be allowed initially which was when

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.700
[Guest]: People were not very happy with the moderators

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:53.780
[Guest]: They could just make another subreddit and then move en masse there

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:57.800
[Guest]: So this happened if I remember correctly it happened very famously to r-marijuana

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:04.200
[Guest]: So for some reason the moderator out there had some issues and the team and the users who were going there weren't too happy

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.180
[Guest]: So they moved en masse to r-trees

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.200
[Guest]: Which is why anytime you go to r-trees, it's not about plants

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.840
[Guest]: It's about a very specific type of herb

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.400
[Guest]: So what happened to the tree lovers? They moved to r-marijuana later on if I remember correctly

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.200
[Guest]: As I recall, I think that's what happened

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.640
[Amit Varma]: Right. So for a newcomer to reddit

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:28.200
[Guest]: This is all very confusing that you love trees and you want to go to r-marijuana. Yes, it is very much so

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.000
[Amit Varma]: Right, but isn't this also like on the one hand?

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.480
[Amit Varma]: This is very benign and very useful in the sense that okay

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.600
[Amit Varma]: You go from pics to memes and from memes to eternal wolf or whatever

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:41.340
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand it can also sort of drive people to ideological silos

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.440
[Guest]: Which is something that's kind of happened in the broader internet. Exactly

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:48.840
[Guest]: And so all of this possible even the movement of people to r-trees

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.120
[Guest]: Happened because we did not have a lot of moderating tools at that time

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:57.960
[Guest]: Right. So this is an example of one of the tensions which occurs for the need to be able to moderate and stop people talking

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:03.720
[Guest]: About or harming each other online and the freedom to expand into other things. Not all things are benign

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.700
[Guest]: I am generally in favor of moderating tools out of necessity

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:11.560
[Guest]: So one of the tools which we ended up which people not we but moderators in general ended up creating

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:15.880
[Guest]: Is a tool which helps them go through all the comments which are posted on a forum

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:21.080
[Guest]: There's a feed where you can see the newest comment and it would check for very specific keywords for example

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:25.320
[Guest]: Well niggers or other words, which would be very clear-cut

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:30.840
[Guest]: Attempts at hate speech so that way you would be flagged immediately that okay someone out here in your forum

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.840
[Guest]: So you only look at what's flagged?

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.440
[Guest]: Initially, we would try to look at on we would participate in a lot of things

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.840
[Guest]: But at a certain point of time we just had to just look at the queue

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.840
[Guest]: You have to look at what's flagged either by users or based on watch lists

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:48.120
[Guest]: For obvious keywords like i'm going to kill you or die and so on so forth

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:52.520
[Guest]: And of course racial slurs and so on and other similar words. So

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.600
[Guest]: It's always

00:48:54.600 --> 00:49:00.440
[Guest]: About looking at that queue and quite often a lot of forums don't even have enough moderators to manage that

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.440
[Guest]: If it's a topic constrained forum where generally people aren't going to be talking about

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:10.780
[Guest]: Incendiary topics you should usually be able to manage the workload the higher the barrier to entry in that conversation

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:14.760
[Guest]: Usually the better the conversation because to get in

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.720
[Guest]: It's not that easy. You have to know what if you're going to talk about

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:19.880
[Guest]: um

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:22.040
[Guest]: Let's say a very complex game

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:28.040
[Guest]: For example, the only people who can play that game are people who've passed the barrier have the time and willingness to indulge themselves

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:33.000
[Guest]: In a certain level of effort everyone else out there is also spending the same amount of effort

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:37.000
[Guest]: So it's very easy to make out a faker or a poser or someone who's just talking about it

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.640
[Guest]: But doesn't know what he's talking about. So the conversation out there tends to be on topic and very neat

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.040
[Guest]: And that has a very nice sense of community

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:48.360
[Guest]: The other subreddits which tend to work out are ones which have very heavy moderation like ask history

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:55.880
[Guest]: Ask history has a dedicated team of volunteer people with backgrounds in specific parts of history and they are

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000
[Guest]: Educators teachers master holders and phd holders on those topics

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:05.960
[Guest]: So any time of any question that is asked and only as far as I remember only questions can be asked

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:12.120
[Guest]: Can be asked the first response has to be a qualified and informed response with sourcing

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.400
[Guest]: So you can ask whatever question and you will usually get a good answer

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.840
[Guest]: If you go in there to just make jokes about oh, you know

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.960
[Guest]: Well, the pyramids were made by aliens comments like that disappear

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:26.040
[Guest]: They immediately removed and the only thing which remains is high quality conversation

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.480
[Amit Varma]: So in the sense they are also doing what my friend Manish used to do at sepia mutiny

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:34.440
[Amit Varma]: They're banning for stupidity that particular subreddit. Yes, or to be put a finer point on it

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.440
[Guest]: They're banning noise

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:41.320
[Guest]: They have a very clear-cut definition of signal and there's a very easy way to say this is signal

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:46.120
[Guest]: Because it's a very limited topic generally when you have a limited topic, you can do a good job

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:51.400
[Guest]: For example, you're talking about music and you're talking about a specific type of music or how to play a specific instrument

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:57.160
[Guest]: That would usually work a lot better unless you suddenly got into a war about which musician you like over the other

00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:03.480
[Guest]: Those are different but even there the moderators can step in and say we're not going to really have a fight on these topics

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.160
[Guest]: You can move it to someplace else

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:09.960
[Amit Varma]: so it seems to me that one of the real problems with the moving away from reddit for just a moment because the question

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.720
[Amit Varma]: occurred to me is that

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.480
[Amit Varma]: Uh, this becomes a problem at scale when you don't have specific subjects

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.680
[Amit Varma]: For example with facebook

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:22.520
[Amit Varma]: I imagine how the moderation is that everyone who flags something that goes into some kind of queue and they have like

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:28.520
[Amit Varma]: Uh, they have some call center somewhere where they have thousand two thousand people just sitting at comms and one after the other these images

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:31.080
[Amit Varma]: Flash up and they're all general. They're not specific

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.440
[Amit Varma]: So it's not like a knowledge-based thing like ask history where the guidelines are clear

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:39.580
[Amit Varma]: You ban this you don't ban that and they have to make subjective calls based on general guidelines

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:44.360
[Amit Varma]: And there is often very little recourse available because if they if they delete something they delete something

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.840
[Amit Varma]: How does that work and what are the ways around that?

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.280
[Guest]: so

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:53.160
[Guest]: Yeah, I completely agree with you where the more subjective it is the more difficult it is and when we're talking about subjective at facebook

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:59.880
[Guest]: Scale we're talking about what's subjective in one part of india and what's no subjective in america and india and america alone have very different

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:07.480
[Guest]: Concepts legally about what is free and what is fair what is okay speech like the term chinky eyes would be interpreted differently

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.840
[Amit Varma]: By someone here and someone in minnesota, for example, so, you know

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:15.320
[Guest]: yeah, and out and what you tend to see is that there's a sort of cross-pollination that

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:20.520
[Guest]: All of those that if you're using any of those words we you tend to say, okay, maybe that person's racist

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.840
[Guest]: It may not be it it is

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:26.360
[Guest]: Quite often and now it's the de jure to assume that's racist, right?

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:30.840
[Guest]: So while back in the day, maybe it was not now it is so there's also a sort of

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:36.600
[Guest]: Effect where people are learning what cultural norms exist in other places

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:44.120
[Guest]: And online is sort of being transplanted also to other nations in other countries sometimes for the better sometimes just

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:48.440
[Amit Varma]: It's an alien entrant because what i'd imagine is from what you describe of reddit

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:54.920
[Amit Varma]: Is that the way the moderators work on different subreddits and so on is something that's evolved over a period of many many years

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.400
[Guest]: Very much learning and discussion and tool and tool creation. We did not like so

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:06.040
[Guest]: Basically people end up blocking mentions of certain subreddits. So if that old moderator on uh,

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:11.400
[Guest]: That particular subreddit or marijuana had these tools. He could basically block all mention of our trees

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.640
[Guest]: So no one would know it would exist. Wow

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:18.680
[Guest]: So it would be it would have to be done through various roundabout methods. It would be much harder

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.640
[Guest]: So it's not it's a lot harder for people to move with their feet

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:27.480
[Guest]: And this is an example of where there's a tension between the creation of tools to make it easier for people to deal with

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.040
[Guest]: basically assholes

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.040
[Guest]: And how those tools end up

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:35.800
[Guest]: Inadvertently stopping expansion into other spaces and here's the thing

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:41.000
[Amit Varma]: It's this is something that's evolved over a period of time into a kind of science at reddit where you have all these years

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:46.680
[Amit Varma]: Of collective experience and you've reached certain ways of working in certain norms in the moderating community at reddit

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:52.520
[Amit Varma]: But what companies like facebook and twitter and so on are having to do is just to set rules on the fly and just deal

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.040
[Amit Varma]: with shit on the fly without

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.360
[Amit Varma]: You know having these years and years of processes

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.280
[Guest]: I would say that making shit up on the fly is basically the rule

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.480
[Guest]: It's if you have the time you go read up on

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:08.440
[Guest]: The rules of what free speech are or like what some court cases you go and educate yourself

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:14.120
[Guest]: But in general everyone's making this shit up on the fly and at the end of the day, I think what's deciding it is

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.120
[Guest]: What works?

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.160
[Guest]: So for a lot of people it just they can't manage conversations

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:26.120
[Guest]: They just remove it for a lot of other people. It's just constant banning and removal of conversations which do not match

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:34.360
[Guest]: The stated purpose of the forum which results in what you'd mentioned silos. So for example, there's a very large forum dedicated to

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:39.480
[Guest]: uh, the current sitting president of the united states of america with the donald and

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.840
[Guest]: for a very long time they figured out ways in which

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:46.600
[Guest]: They could make sure that their topics showed up on the front page

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.760
[Guest]: So that everyone else on the forum had to watch it and they were quite pleased with being able to do that

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:58.040
[Guest]: Eventually reddit changed the entire way the front page algorithm worked to prevent users from ganging together and gaming the front page

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:03.000
[Guest]: So one of the issues over here is that the donald which is the name of the subreddit

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:07.080
[Guest]: Over there. They if you are critical of the president they remove you

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:14.040
[Guest]: Conversely other subreddits now notice if you have posted in the donald and then they remove you for just interacting in that space

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.040
[Guest]: So even if it is a question

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:21.080
[Guest]: Innocuously stated that you know, why is he doing this? You will find yourself banned from several other subreddits

00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.480
[Guest]: They will just say you are not allowed to speak here

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.680
[Guest]: It's a very strange evolution of

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.960
[Guest]: Group warfare which has occurred because of this this echo chamber effect

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.600
[Guest]: I don't even know how to explain or understand this particular

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:39.720
[Amit Varma]: So the the social scientist cast sunstein a kind of term group polarization

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:44.440
[Amit Varma]: And what they did was I think he and his colleagues did a study where they got a bunch of

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.520
[Amit Varma]: republicans and

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:50.200
[Amit Varma]: Democrats kind of together and they took their positions on a variety of issues

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:55.320
[Amit Varma]: And then they put them together in with like-minded people and they also put them together in mixed groups

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.640
[Amit Varma]: And they found that those who were

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:02.280
[Amit Varma]: Huddled together with like-minded people all of them tended to grow more

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:05.640
[Amit Varma]: All of them tended to grow more extreme in their opinion

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.040
[Amit Varma]: you know

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.680
[Amit Varma]: Than the other groups and what this did was that it?

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:17.320
[Amit Varma]: And when we form echo chambers, we essentially then interact only with like-minded people whose ideas already match us

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:25.320
[Amit Varma]: The confirmation bias kicks in where we ignore all ideas from outside and we only take in the news that conforms to our biases

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.080
[Amit Varma]: and

00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:30.040
[Amit Varma]: These groups get further and further apart. And finally you find that

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:35.640
[Amit Varma]: Uh in society, we are not talking to each other anymore. We are talking past each other. We are abusing each other

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean one of my constant complaints is that

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.920
[Amit Varma]: Why political discourse is pretty much finished on social media

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:48.600
[Amit Varma]: Especially twitter is that all argument comes down to attacking the person and not the argument

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:55.400
[Amit Varma]: On the one hand and on the other hand virtue signaling to raise your status within your own in group

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:59.000
[Amit Varma]: Rather than honestly trying to engage with the other side, right?

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.480
[Guest]: So it's a lot of just throwing headlines at each other

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.840
[Guest]: You're not really talking to the other person you want to show to the rest of your team

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:09.640
[Guest]: Look that guy's an idiot. I am so great. I've made him shut up. That's generally the point

00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:14.120
[Guest]: it's so the echo chamber effect is very insidious and this is something which

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:20.620
[Guest]: Again, this is about the frontier constantly moving as we improve on our tools and improve on our ways to deal with communication

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:23.080
[Guest]: We find new and new effects which we didn't intend

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:28.620
[Guest]: So reddit had a really simple way back then you could just upvote a topic and you would see lots of interesting conversations

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.440
[Guest]: And now because so many people ended up using that for their own gain

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:37.560
[Guest]: So they would create they would try to spam or they would try to control conversations or they would just try to

00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:41.960
[Guest]: Be power users or just be the most the one to make the funniest comment

00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:46.120
[Guest]: There were constant rules and changes to the way the algorithm works to make it more complex

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.160
[Guest]: While that has had positive benefits

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:54.360
[Guest]: One of the side effects is that now it's just enhanced the echo chamber effect you tend to go to your group

00:57:54.680 --> 00:58:00.280
[Guest]: And then in your group you only argue about the things which you have already decided and anytime someone else says something different

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:04.200
[Guest]: That person is immediately chucked out. It's it's really

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.660
[Guest]: It's really creating a very disheartening situation

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:14.380
[Amit Varma]: And would you say that this is not something necessarily brought about by the internet or by technology, but this is a human characteristic

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:20.540
[Amit Varma]: characteristic that is amplified by technology like technology amplifies both the best and the worst and

00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:27.600
[Amit Varma]: It enables both our best and worst instincts and this tendency to think tribalistically and to form these sort of silos

00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:31.680
[Amit Varma]: Is something that is inherent but that is now being enabled by technology

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.300
[Amit Varma]: and therefore it becomes

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:42.300
[Amit Varma]: Problematic and complex to give it a moral dimension and to say that no things should not be like this. So I think I

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:48.240
[Guest]: I don't remember the full argument. My personal gut take is that this is because of technology

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:50.780
[Guest]: that inherently

00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:53.580
[Guest]: This is a new way for human beings to be with each other

00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:57.420
[Guest]: And the problems it causes are inherently because of the medium

00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:04.460
[Guest]: So I think this is a much faster cycle. You get your comments you get your responses a lot quicker and it's also

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:06.220
[Guest]: very context poor

00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:10.700
[Guest]: So like when i'm talking to you guys and I can see all of you all I can see whether you're interested bored tired cold

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:13.100
[Guest]: It gives me a lot of information on what your state of mind is

00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:17.340
[Guest]: But if i'm and by making eye contact I can also figure out I can also

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.900
[Guest]: Understand your body language. You can understand mine

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:24.220
[Guest]: You can show so many things our brains are really well designed for dealing with other people

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:27.740
[Guest]: Our music our dance our entire culture is about that but online

00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:33.180
[Guest]: You just see what's written. You don't know the tone. You don't know the background

00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:37.100
[Guest]: You don't know whether the person is a angry person sad person and he's had a bad day

00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:41.100
[Guest]: Whether someone has beat him up or not. You don't know any of that. You just take that concept

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:45.180
[Guest]: And then you try to interpret it and in a context poem system

00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:49.900
[Guest]: We tend to put a lot more other information on it to try to understand it

00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:54.460
[Guest]: And that tends to cause a very different set of interactions and behavior

00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.260
[Guest]: The other aspect is that this stuff is fast

00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:01.100
[Guest]: It's like the worst combinations sometimes of having a book

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:07.020
[Guest]: And having an argument. A book you can open up and you can always read that page. You can close the book go back and forget it

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:11.660
[Guest]: A conversation you can have once or twice and then you can say something in anger

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.060
[Guest]: And then leave and everyone will forget it

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:19.180
[Guest]: But an online conversation you can say something angry and you can put it out there in that moment of anger

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:23.100
[Guest]: And then everyone will read it like a book and they will come back to it

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:26.380
[Guest]: And this is actually something which people would use to like remind people

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:31.340
[Guest]: Oh, you said this back then and then they would bring that post up and they would say don't listen to this person because

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:34.380
[Guest]: Once upon a time he said something which was bad about xyz person

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:37.900
[Amit Varma]: This is a screenshot culture on twitter where you'll put up a screenshot from

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.140
[Guest]: 2012 and yeah, yeah, yeah

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:45.260
[Amit Varma]: Which is sometimes useful in the case of politicians because you find that most of the best criticisms against Modi

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:48.060
[Amit Varma]: For example have been made by Modi himself, right, you know

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:54.780
[Amit Varma]: Back in the past on questions of principles and not talking to the press and so on and so forth

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.220
[Guest]: So on and so forth

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.380
[Guest]: But that's also another aspect about change, right?

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:02.300
[Guest]: All of us say something which later on we can regret or we can change but

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:08.060
[Guest]: Because of the nature of the written word and the way we are used to at least the older generation is used to looking at

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:11.100
[Guest]: It is that it's something more final but over here

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.900
[Guest]: It's sort of the it can be quite often the worst of both worlds

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.780
[Amit Varma]: And also I forget where I read. This is one of these social science

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.980
[Amit Varma]: Studies one of those behavioral econ things. I forget exactly

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:24.700
[Amit Varma]: Which study it is but the thing is if you can get someone to commit to something in writing

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.860
[Amit Varma]: They are more likely to carry out their promise

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:32.220
[Amit Varma]: For example, if you you know, and and it strikes me just thinking aloud that if someone

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:38.080
[Amit Varma]: For whatever reasons ends up saying something in a moment of anger just because it's there permanently

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:42.940
[Amit Varma]: They then feel compelled to double down and defend it and that changes their character itself

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.220
[Amit Varma]: They become a different person because of what they might have said in a moment of anger

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.980
[Guest]: Which they would otherwise have forgotten exactly

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:53.900
[Guest]: So this is why like as to your point whether this is just human tendency. I think that this is not just human tendency

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:55.900
[Guest]: I think this is very much

01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:00.460
[Guest]: The new world we live in and it's very much because of technology and because it's been designed

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:04.940
[Guest]: let's not forget that all of these systems are designed for maximum engagement because

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:09.900
[Guest]: Just because if you don't have people on your forum and you don't have people on your website for long enough

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:11.660
[Guest]: You're not going to have enough advertisers

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.300
[Guest]: You're not going to have enough people being attracted then this is

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:18.940
[Guest]: Related to the previous problem where we had our news cycles being very fast or if anyone's seen

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:24.860
[Guest]: Indian television, you'll know what the news cycle is on steroids. Everyone is shouting at each other for no reason

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:29.980
[Guest]: We may all argue and we may all at the same time hold the same opinion, but we will fight

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:35.260
[Amit Varma]: Boss, what kind of guy are you you're moderating reddit comments by day and you're watching indian news television by night. No, no

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.340
[Unknown]: How do you live?

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.180
[Guest]: How are you sane

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:43.900
[Guest]: I mean the answer i'm quite no i'm not quite sane

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:49.980
[Guest]: But no i've there's I can only take so much of dangerous cancerous objects at a time. I chose reddit

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.580
[Guest]: But yeah

01:02:53.580 --> 01:03:00.220
[Guest]: That's generally the trend what was okay in our previous world of television and books and arguing it's not okay online

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:05.420
[Amit Varma]: I'd actually say now sure technology is enabled all this and turbocharged all this but I think all these I disagree

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.900
[Guest]: I'd say it's created. It's not enabled enabled

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:11.740
[Amit Varma]: Enabled is I think the wrong word. See i'll tell you what I mean one thing for example

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.300
[Amit Varma]: I think you'd agree with me is that the world is becoming more and more tribal

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:19.180
[Amit Varma]: And we've always in terms of instinct the tribalistic instinct has always been there

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:23.500
[Amit Varma]: It's only now that technology has brought it about so that we find more and more of these

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.900
[Amit Varma]: finely honed

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:30.300
[Amit Varma]: Sort of tribes which nevertheless have scale because we can reach out to anyone else in the world

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.940
[Amit Varma]: For example who may hate mongoose?

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:37.340
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, and and so all these all the people who hate our keto

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:44.300
[Amit Varma]: Down with our keto down with our keto. Yeah, I mean I I've had heated arguments online with people about keto and

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:48.940
[Amit Varma]: You know, which is on the face of it completely bizarre because you know, you eat what you eat

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.940
[Amit Varma]: Well, I mean, would you argue in real life?

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:57.900
[Guest]: I think there's so many stupid things which are so the amount the ability for stupid topics to become massive points of fracture

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:04.300
[Guest]: Is absurd i'm i'm actually seeing in some forums that there's a growing north-south divide between india itself with something

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:07.100
[Guest]: Which I didn't I literally saw grow out of nothing

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:13.260
[Guest]: And now because it's there it's online there's data which can back up both opinions and people who are angry about something

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:18.620
[Guest]: It's going to grow you give a fracture point and you allow people a topic on which they can have different opinions

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:20.860
[Guest]: The internet will go to work helping

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.980
[Guest]: Separate those groups and make those new echo chambers

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:28.300
[Amit Varma]: Well, i'm just going to say that bombay is out of this north-south debate because we get the worst of it

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.900
[Amit Varma]: The south thinks we are in the north and the north thinks we're in the south. So no one no

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:34.300
[Guest]: No, what you're saying? Bombay is broken up between north and south

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:39.340
[Amit Varma]: We've had that running feud going on since when that's internally

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:43.500
[Amit Varma]: Like another aspect which I think is an aspect of human nature

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:48.140
[Amit Varma]: But the internet amplifies is a performative aspect in the sense that we are all putting on an act for others all the time

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:50.940
[Amit Varma]: And we're trying to show ourselves as noble or knowledgeable or whatever

01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.580
[Amit Varma]: Every action of ours in some sense is an act of signaling

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:58.220
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and the internet allows you to do that on a massive scale to the point that I think everyone on twitter today

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:02.860
[Amit Varma]: Is just performing. No one's actually communicating. Forget twitter. I want from what I see on other people's facebook

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:07.100
[Guest]: I want their facebook life. I don't want their real life. I want their facebook. Yeah, exactly

01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:11.980
[Guest]: Everything is happy. Everyone's birthday is remembered holidays are the best the food is the greatest

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.540
[Guest]: And you only show up when you had a great day

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:18.380
[Guest]: I know exactly and and and I think the mistake people made I think uh

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:20.380
[Amit Varma]: was it um

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:24.140
[Amit Varma]: There's a great book called. Um, everybody lies by noah stevens david owens

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:27.500
[Amit Varma]: If you've heard of it where he talks about where he essentially looks at

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:34.380
[Amit Varma]: Millions of google searches and social media searches and all that and finds out what people are really like aside from their performative aspects

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:38.940
[Amit Varma]: And there's a very striking line in that. I don't know if he's quoting someone or he's saying this himself

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:44.780
[Amit Varma]: But there's a very striking line of how people tend to compare their real lives with other people's facebook lives

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:49.500
[Guest]: Yeah, and it's it's a source of such pain and angst

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:53.740
[Guest]: It's like keeping up with the joneses but on steroids and it's not just the joneses who live next to you

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:55.740
[Guest]: It's the joneses, you've known all through your life

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:59.100
[Guest]: Everyone but the flip side is i've gained new skills

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:02.460
[Amit Varma]: I am officially the best selfie taker in bombay, which would never have happened

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:06.540
[Amit Varma]: Had there not been a performative side to me also, but but to get back to this, I mean, this is

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:11.980
[Amit Varma]: Really a subject far more serious than I think either of us even know how to express

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:17.820
[Amit Varma]: Because what is happening in the world is that politics everywhere is becoming more and more tribal people have stopped talking to each other

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:22.620
[Amit Varma]: No news is real news. All news is in some way or the other fake news in a sense

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:25.180
[Amit Varma]: We are all living in our imagined universes and feeding

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:29.340
[Amit Varma]: Basically, there's so much information coming at which point do you just give up and say forget it?

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:34.060
[Guest]: Yeah, let someone else make the decisions because I really can't make out the signal from the noise what mitigates this

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:38.220
[Guest]: What medicates this or what can mitigate this what I really don't know

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:45.900
[Guest]: Because even just discussing this topic, there's so many things being left out about changes and in the way even a simple site like reddit works

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:50.060
[Guest]: I think the only thing that mitigates this is what one of my friends did. So he's really balanced chap

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.140
[Guest]: He's got a great sense of humor. He's generally as a person

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:57.020
[Guest]: He's a really good person and he's still not a pushover or anything. He's just generally very nice

01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:01.420
[Guest]: He I spoke to him one day. I was like, dude, you know what's happening and so on so forth

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:05.100
[Guest]: He basically said he's cut off. He's shut down all his social media channels

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:10.860
[Guest]: He's off of social media. He really doesn't care what his friends are doing and he's spending his time practicing guitar doing his work

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:15.020
[Guest]: He has just cut off and that was the first time I saw a ray of hope

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.380
[Guest]: On how to deal with this and that's strength from one individual

01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:22.540
[Guest]: I think most of us are frankly just addicted to the dopamine rush of the next notification

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:27.020
[Amit Varma]: And it takes a lot of willpower to cut off and most people just go with the flow and they don't do it

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:30.940
[Amit Varma]: Well, we're going to figure something out because as you said, it's a dopamine rush

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:35.580
[Guest]: But at the end of the day the other analogy to look at all of this interaction online, it's like going to gym

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:39.580
[Guest]: It's about healthy conversations and healthy habits and

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:46.300
[Guest]: How many of us eat healthy and how many of us at the start of the year decide we are going to go to gym?

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:50.540
[Guest]: And we're going to be the best person version of ourselves. We can be i'm going to exercise

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:55.340
[Guest]: I'm going to make sure i'm disciplined and i'm going to make sure i'm better and happier with myself. Those are the same

01:07:55.340 --> 01:08:00.780
[Guest]: Issues which you find online. It's not that everyone just generally a lot of people aren't really happy when they abuse someone

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:03.820
[Guest]: I mean at the end of the day, they may say okay that guy deserved it

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:07.420
[Guest]: And another aspect is that I would rather have constructive conversations

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:13.900
[Guest]: Or I would rather be part of constructive and educational conversations and not either waste time or eat intellectual junk food

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:16.460
[Guest]: Now, so the question is

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:20.620
[Guest]: One, eventually when do any of these things happen?

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:28.380
[Guest]: So the question is one eventually when do does everyone recognize that there is a certain sort of gym for the mind?

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:34.940
[Guest]: Or certain habits which we have to inculcate as normal users of the internet in the way we interact so that

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:40.460
[Guest]: We don't cause harm to ourselves. We have good conversations and we make others around us happy

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:45.100
[Guest]: And two when are we going to find the self-discipline to do that?

01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:49.660
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, I know your earlier question about new year resolutions was rhetorical but this new year

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:53.020
[Amit Varma]: I made a resolution that I would I do a life hack basically

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:58.540
[Amit Varma]: And in the four months since then thanks to a certain subreddit and I think you know, which one i'm talking about

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:05.500
[Amit Varma]: I've lost 15 kgs since the start of january. We're in may right now. So the keto subreddit on no, I don't

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:09.580
[Amit Varma]: particularly go there much but I think it's an incredible subreddit and I'd

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:12.700
[Amit Varma]: heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:18.320
[Amit Varma]: Get their lives together. But again one like there's a guy called adam alter who wrote a very good book called irresistible

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.000
[Amit Varma]: About how people are hooked to technology all the time

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.240
[Amit Varma]: Including a lot of social media and there are apparently apps you can download

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:33.680
[Amit Varma]: Which will tell you how often you look at the phone in a day and the average person picks up their phone every seventh minute

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.680
[Amit Varma]: Once every seven minutes of the waking day not when they're sleeping though

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:41.360
[Amit Varma]: And most people don't realize how hooked they are to all of this

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:48.980
[Amit Varma]: And therefore these constant distractions of these notifications prevent them from doing any kind of deep work deep thinking introspection

01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:51.520
[Amit Varma]: discovering other offline joys

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.640
[Amit Varma]: we've all kind of

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:58.720
[Amit Varma]: Become slaves to the internet and it's it's easy enough to understand this at a rational level and say that. Yeah

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.360
[Guest]: I'm going to uninstall

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:06.960
[Guest]: But it's very hard to actually do it. You always exactly so as someone who has repeatedly failed using these apps

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:12.240
[Guest]: My sincere advice is that they will come a time when you actually genuinely want it only download the app then

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.840
[Guest]: Because eventually what will happen is that when you use these apps you figure out a way to work around these apps

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.440
[Guest]: So when you're serious download them and use it for the first time

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.720
[Guest]: Because once you figure out a way around it, then the charm becomes a lot

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:28.320
[Guest]: Their charm decreases then it becomes a straight-up test of willpower

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.000
[Guest]: Anyway that particular insight aside from someone who has tried and failed

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.640
[Guest]: I think there's a lot of there while there are what you have done is very positive in general

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:41.440
[Guest]: If you are self-directed and you are able to focus then yes, there's a lot of stuff you can get online

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:44.080
[Guest]: But other than that the internet is designed

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.280
[Guest]: In many ways to deal with our

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:52.720
[Guest]: Weak spots in our mental heuristics like in the way our brain works. We know a lot of research

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:56.960
[Guest]: We know even before modern like google and everyone else showed up

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:03.760
[Guest]: We already knew a lot about how people behave with colors with stimulation and we'd done like the first basic piece of research

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.760
[Guest]: Found that if people are not on your website for more than a few seconds

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.680
[Guest]: They're gone. Like if you're not engaging them in the first few seconds, they're gone and that's it

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:18.400
[Guest]: Your site is dead. And so even basic websites back in the html days from that time onwards they have been

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:25.840
[Guest]: Constantly evolving to be so lovely. So just genuinely smooth buttery smooth on your phone

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:32.240
[Guest]: Quick responsive pleasant to look at all of these things just so that they can engage you because

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.280
[Guest]: And here we can discuss the economics of it and whatnot

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.920
[Guest]: But let's just just focus on how these websites are designed

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:46.640
[Guest]: Websites and most of the programs today are using a full arsenal of psychological and technological tools to keep you there

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.800
[Guest]: I frankly think most people are unaware of it. I don't think most people are prepared

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:56.240
[Guest]: I'm certain that in any one kilometer 10 kilometer radius around you anywhere in the world. There'll only be maybe

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.680
[Guest]: 0.1 percent of the people who know what tools are being used against you. I I absolutely agree even less than that

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.840
[Amit Varma]: So let me pose you a thought experiment with two questions

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.640
[Amit Varma]: Supposing somebody i've heard some version of this perhaps from robert nozick. I forget

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:15.600
[Amit Varma]: Uh, so i'm afraid I can't attribute the original because i've just forgotten but supposing someone creates a pleasure machine

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.480
[Amit Varma]: Right now the pleasure machine the end of humanity is there

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:23.840
[Amit Varma]: No, no, so the pleasure machine is an advanced machine which which puts electrodes in your brain and everything

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.440
[Amit Varma]: And then you're no longer in the real world. You are in this

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.840
[Amit Varma]: Artificial world, which is one of your own designing where only good things happen to you and you're

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:38.960
[Amit Varma]: 24 7 for the rest of your life. You're in this extremely pleasurable experience and you can design that experience

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.960
[Amit Varma]: It is whatever you want it to be

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:46.640
[Amit Varma]: One would you say that that's a good thing for society if everyone has one like that and two

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.640
[Amit Varma]: Would you yourself opt for it?

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.920
[Amit Varma]: And an honest answer because the obvious answer if you're being

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:55.840
[Unknown]: If you're being performative the answer is no I want to live the real life

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.880
[Amit Varma]: I want to go to the fields and so on and so forth, but what's what are what are we after?

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.840
[Guest]: As human beings I have an I love sketching. I have an active imagination from my child

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:11.120
[Guest]: So any fantasy world I create will be extremely meticulously created to keep me very happy

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.920
[Guest]: I think you put that thing on my head once i'm done building it

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:20.000
[Guest]: You wouldn't get me out of it. I would fight for my life for my right to be completely and utterly befuddled and why not?

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:25.520
[Guest]: You've just described heaven. You've described see the only thing limited what will happen is that

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.760
[Guest]: Fortunately, I don't think anyone can create a machine of that level of sophistication

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:34.480
[Guest]: Because that level of detail will always be difficult. But what you'll have is your brain will give the detail

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:39.760
[Amit Varma]: You uh, you'll just everything I know about basically about people's ability to be very precise in defining

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.480
[Guest]: A world is poor, but what will happen instead is that people will start with the first minecraft like worlds

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.480
[Guest]: Then they'll share it with each other and then there's someone will start and over a few months and years

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:54.240
[Guest]: You will get worlds of increasing sophistication and finally all of that the community of those creators will just go inside and never come out

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:58.560
[Guest]: And why not that's a perfect world and isn't that the world being created for us?

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.600
[Amit Varma]: It's not exactly a pleasure machine, but it's more like a

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:07.760
[Amit Varma]: A numbness machine where you know people can browse facebook for hours or you know

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.720
[Guest]: People can browse facebook for hours or look at it for hours

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.840
[Guest]: So a different perspective on this is i'm a gamer and one of the reasons why

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.400
[Guest]: Uh, i'm aware of a lot of these tools is because they've increasingly been put into games

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:25.540
[Guest]: But there's one gaming company nintendo which builds games with a very different with a very familial

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.680
[Guest]: Focus focus on the family and how to interact and a lot of their games are a lot

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:35.040
[Guest]: They feel healthier like they created the wii initially and that was a different way to interact with games

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:41.200
[Guest]: I mean generally speaking people don't like playing getting up and moving around your calories are used in your thumb

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.720
[Guest]: Any more and why the hell you could just go out to a dance class

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:50.400
[Guest]: But they built that because I assume at some level they felt that would be an interesting way to get people to work together

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.040
[Guest]: so there is a certain sort of

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:58.720
[Guest]: Outlook and mindset you can have when designing these products which is not built on the old silicon valley

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.040
[Guest]: Network effect or you must absorb everyone into your network

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.240
[Guest]: Which is more human and humane or at least that's my hope

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.400
[Guest]: There's a way to look at it and say that you know

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.440
[Guest]: I'm going to prioritize values which are more about interacting and making it easier for people to interact

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.600
[Guest]: So maybe the material will be slower

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.600
[Guest]: Maybe the material will be less flashy

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:22.800
[Guest]: Maybe it won't use the fastest engine in the world or the fastest chip and it's not going to be that maybe it's not

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.920
[Guest]: Going to be made out of magnesium and chrome, but i'm focusing on

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:32.160
[Guest]: Meaningful ways for or tools for which which with which people can interact and build their own

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.960
[Guest]: Stories and their own things

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.800
[Guest]: I think at this point of time we had to discuss a little bit about the dynamics of the

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.680
[Guest]: Economy behind a lot of the large firms which are influencing us

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:47.360
[Guest]: Fortunately, a lot of these firms like google facebook genuinely at some level want to do well for the world

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.400
[Guest]: Unfortunately at some level they are not going to because they need to deal with their shareholders

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.440
[Guest]: To deal with their shareholders and they need to compete and that means keeping people on their platforms

01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:02.900
[Amit Varma]: What would doing good with the world mean in the context of google and facebook make their products less addictive?

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:06.640
[Guest]: I think in their terms it would be

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.800
[Guest]: One you could say make their products less addictive

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:12.720
[Guest]: But that doesn't really solve the problem because then that'll just bring someone else up and say hey, you know

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.720
[Amit Varma]: What look at my new shiny addictive app

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.540
[Guest]: Right. So then it would be about the next step of responsibility

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:24.020
[Guest]: Which would be deploying the amount of people and work required to ensuring that this is customized for a lot of things

01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:29.940
[Guest]: and frankly, I think that's beyond the scope of most firms and beyond the scope of what most markets and most

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:35.400
[Guest]: Shareholders really expect of their firm. That's quite often a role for governments

01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:38.260
[Guest]: and for people to decide so

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:44.820
[Amit Varma]: That's very hard and I think I think the aspect of it, which I have sort of difficulty in reconciling

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:49.140
[Amit Varma]: I'm, not sure how I feel about it. Uh, tell me what you think is that

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:56.180
[Amit Varma]: Here are you and I sitting and making a judgment of these kind of behaviors on the part of firms are bad for society

01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:01.160
[Amit Varma]: But then the point is that as long as all actions are voluntary

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:08.420
[Amit Varma]: If there are a million people sitting in their homes who want what facebook is giving them who want that numbness who want that addiction

01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:14.340
[Amit Varma]: Who don't mind that uh, who don't mind that being in echo chambers and not communicating with the rest of the world

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:21.380
[Amit Varma]: Then what right does someone have to get in the way coercively? So I think let's move back a lot ideologically

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:26.420
[Guest]: So this ideologically speaking is I am an individual. I have a choice over my right

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:31.940
[Guest]: What right do you have over deciding me? And I think this is a great ideology if you lived alone

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:38.420
[Guest]: In especially in a country like india, which is as crowded. So if you had like infinite, I actually disagree

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:42.420
[Amit Varma]: It's it's an irrelevant ideology if you live alone, but if you live in society

01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:49.560
[Amit Varma]: This is the only ideology which can actually safeguard everybody if you pay attention to consent and if you fight coercion

01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:52.500
[Guest]: I think we're lucky to be in india in that sense

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:54.580
[Guest]: because while

01:17:54.580 --> 01:18:02.260
[Guest]: In india, you very clear clearly live in a society where that's not the founding father's intent belief or system and there is such a

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:04.260
[Guest]: massive

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:11.220
[Guest]: Amount of ideology online and words online which find roots in the old school american types in the well not old school modern

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:12.100
[Guest]: modern

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.100
[Guest]: thoughts which

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:19.140
[Guest]: Permeate america or used to permeate online conversations if you're within that particular subset of people

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:22.520
[Guest]: So I think I've grown to appreciate

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.620
[Guest]: how you can manage to

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:30.920
[Guest]: Have speech have a working functional marketplace

01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:36.260
[Guest]: Without having to go for massive and utterly completely unfettered speech

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:41.220
[Amit Varma]: Uh, leaving leaving speech aside for a moment once you agree in principle that the government

01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:46.200
[Amit Varma]: Uh should be able to impose certain preferences on people coercively

01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:49.780
[Amit Varma]: Then how are you to decide what preferences those should be?

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:52.820
[Amit Varma]: So then it comes around to your saying that hey, you know

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:58.420
[Amit Varma]: Amit and me are wise and we will decide and these things are bad for society. I know why not someone else

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:02.500
[Amit Varma]: I know better than you it comes around to that. It's much better to let individuals make their own choices

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.860
[Guest]: While once upon a time, I would have been sitting on the other side of this conversation

01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:07.940
[Guest]: The point is that someone is making a decision

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:13.220
[Guest]: Anyway, you don't decide it and you don't have responsible people and a judge jury

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:15.540
[Guest]: laws behind it

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:20.100
[Guest]: Then some random dude in a suit is going to make it because they have to and that decision is being made

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:25.540
[Guest]: By me and many other moderators every day because it's necessity. It's a part of your volunteer work

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:29.940
[Amit Varma]: So what you and your fellow moderators do is in no way an issue for me

01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:34.100
[Amit Varma]: It's not even a free speech issue because it's reddit as a private company

01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:36.660
[Guest]: but that's just a but that's a distinction based upon a very

01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:41.700
[Guest]: See if we forget about private and public those at some point of time

01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:45.700
[Guest]: They're useful as solid concepts and sometimes they're just a dodge. They're just sort of a

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:49.620
[Guest]: Superficial fig leaf when we're actually looking at the mechanisms

01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.580
[Guest]: Not always not always but if you're actually looking at the working

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:58.260
[Guest]: Of that ecosystem if you're looking and seeing how whether actual ideas get across i am bothered

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:03.780
[Guest]: That in some ways moderators if they go rogue can end up shutting down entire portions of the kind of a lot of harm

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:04.820
[Amit Varma]: But i'll tell you what, I mean

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:11.300
[Amit Varma]: I look at the world through the prism of consent or the other side of that coin coercion. Now, the thing is that

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:17.460
[Amit Varma]: If a reddit moderator bans me if I say something, uh

01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:21.620
[Amit Varma]: Then it's bye-bye. Yeah, then it's bye-bye, but it's fine. It's it's voluntary

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:26.900
[Amit Varma]: I can go somewhere else but if the indian government strikes down on my free speech, I I can't go anywhere else

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:30.660
[Amit Varma]: I'm forced. I mean that is absolute coercion. I go to reddit out of my choice

01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:34.740
[Amit Varma]: But I am not under the indian state out of my choice. There is coercion there

01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:41.860
[Amit Varma]: Uh, and that is and and that's why the whole question of private and public is not a semantic issue

01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:45.300
[Amit Varma]: It's an it's an issue that goes back to first principles

01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:48.020
[Amit Varma]: So for me anything that involves coercion is wrong

01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:53.700
[Amit Varma]: And if something doesn't involve coercion, then the question has to be asked very seriously. Why is this wrong?

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:59.540
[Guest]: Is it just your judgment fair enough now? So let's there's two problems with the way the current internet is laid out

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:02.740
[Guest]: For that particular thing. So one of them is competition, right the

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:05.060
[Guest]: The you know about the network effect, right?

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:10.420
[Guest]: Of course the basic value of a network or a group of people is whether they have how many people they have on it

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:16.820
[Guest]: That tends to mean that most snapchat reddit facebook twitter are one of a kind. There's no competition, right?

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:19.860
[Guest]: So if you're not on that place, you're nowhere

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:24.500
[Guest]: Yeah, that means that you're you're fundamentally your opinions have been silenced

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:29.460
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but the counter view to that which in fact if you heard my episode with your namesake nikhil pawar

01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:36.020
[Amit Varma]: Where he brought up the same point and the counter view to that is yeah sure it seems in terms of a social network

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.460
[Amit Varma]: There's only facebook in terms of you know

01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:45.620
[Amit Varma]: A certain kind of forum or community there's only reddit and they're behemoths and it's a network affected play

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:51.140
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand they are all competing they are all competing with everything else a person may be able to do with their

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:53.140
[Amit Varma]: Time so if I feel after a while

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:56.820
[Amit Varma]: That facebook is wasting too much of my time or they're not giving me value

01:21:57.140 --> 01:22:00.040
[Guest]: I can read a book I can go all of these things are optimized

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:05.780
[Guest]: As again that comes back to the point of what they're optimizing for all of them are using behavior. They're using basic

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:12.020
[Guest]: Reinforcement schedules you will always get a dopamine hit. Now. You'll have a random period of time. It'll get another dopamine hit

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:15.860
[Guest]: They're all designed to make sure that your interactions are of a certain nature

01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:21.300
[Guest]: Which is generally fast and smooth so it gets to that particular sector. So even if there's competition

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:24.820
[Guest]: It's not really competition for hearing that you're it's not that you're going to be heard

01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:27.620
[Amit Varma]: You're saying they've turned us into sheep and we don't really have a choice

01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:31.300
[Amit Varma]: So the whole concept of I mean the consent really doesn't apply here. Is that what you're saying?

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:37.620
[Guest]: I'm saying that consent that's a very hard statement to take and considering how subtle these effects are for

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:42.020
[Guest]: It's very easy to take make that statement. It's very hard to back it up with hard facts

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:45.140
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm not even disputing it. I'm not asking you to bucket. I'm not disputing it

01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:45.700
[Amit Varma]: No

01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:49.460
[Guest]: But if you're if you're going to be honest about our positions and if you're going to make that effort to go to that

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:55.460
[Guest]: Mental gym, we have to start with making these really fine distinctions. No, but here's the thing. I am completely okay

01:22:56.020 --> 01:23:01.460
[Amit Varma]: Taking what you say is what I say that yes, we are all manipulated and we are in fact

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.460
[Amit Varma]: I don't believe in free will but that's a different philosophical

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:07.460
[Amit Varma]: That's a different philosophical argument, but but the question is that yes

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:10.900
[Amit Varma]: We are being manipulated and we are much less in control of actions and we think

01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:16.660
[Amit Varma]: The tough question to me which I can't get around and i'm not even saying that a is the answer or b is the answer

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:21.800
[Amit Varma]: The tough question to me is that I am fundamentally against coercion because I think coercion

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:25.220
[Amit Varma]: Is toxic to society and you don't want to give anybody that power

01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:30.740
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is that if you want to solve this the only solution that people keep coming up with

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:33.140
[Amit Varma]: That nikhil came up with for example

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:38.340
[Amit Varma]: uh was not you nikhil was the government should step in and it's almighty wisdom and

01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:41.300
[Amit Varma]: You know regulate these companies and that's the only option

01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:46.980
[Amit Varma]: I think that's the worst possible option because you can always assume that the government will be taken over by interest groups of one

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:50.900
[Amit Varma]: Kind or the other and I think there has to be some

01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:52.980
[Amit Varma]: other way forward

01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:59.140
[Amit Varma]: And and do you see hope of some other way forward emerging in the sense that after this cambridge analytical scandal with facebook

01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:04.100
[Amit Varma]: A lot of people though possibly it's a selection bias on our part because we know those kinds of people

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:06.820
[Amit Varma]: But a lot of people did a quit facebook thing and uninstalled it

01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:08.020
[Amit Varma]: uh

01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:13.940
[Amit Varma]: Do you see something like that happening over a period of time as people realize that it's harming the richness of their lives?

01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:16.820
[Amit Varma]: Or do you think that it's a fait accompli?

01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:19.700
[Guest]: I think the

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:24.580
[Guest]: The way the question is laid out. It's very easy to answer. I think it's very easy to say. It's a fait accompli

01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:27.300
[Guest]: because

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:30.740
[Guest]: I think everyone who's listening everyone who's used got a mobile phone

01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:34.340
[Guest]: Has facebook installed and they know how many times they're going to look at it

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:38.100
[Guest]: Or how many times they're going to go on whatsapp and see the same forward come around according to adam

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:41.780
[Guest]: Walter they actually underestimate how often they will look at it, but they know yeah, right

01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:43.140
[Guest]: so

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:45.060
[Guest]: I think that it is fate

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:46.100
[Guest]: because

01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:47.220
[Guest]: you are

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:50.260
[Guest]: On that little black piece of metal you have in your pocket

01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:58.180
[Guest]: There are lists and sits the collective ability of every marketer that has ever lived every psychologist that has ever lived every programmer

01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:03.300
[Guest]: That has ever ever lived and it's there to find your mental weak spots

01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:09.620
[Guest]: To find that moment when you are willing to change an idea when you're willing to engage in something else. I think

01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:15.380
[Guest]: That device is built by people smarter than you who have been paid to be that smart

01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:21.140
[Guest]: And it's designed to beat you or not necessarily beat you. It's designed by people who are hoping to help you

01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:24.020
[Guest]: But unfortunately our way of defining this help

01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:26.100
[Guest]: so far

01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:31.380
[Guest]: Has ended up having lots of unforeseen or foreseeable side effects, which people went ahead with anyway

01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:32.980
[Guest]: so

01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:36.900
[Guest]: The private industry as a whole has followed the incentives correctly

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:42.420
[Guest]: And has explored this new territory and we have found that what genies we have left out of this bottle

01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:48.180
[Guest]: Are not going to go back and that leaves very precious little behavior, which we can control

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:53.700
[Guest]: So in the same way, which we today look at obesity and we look at junk food

01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.740
[Guest]: I think eventually it's sooner rather than later

01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:58.900
[Guest]: We are going to have to deal with this

01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:02.340
[Guest]: The question is whether we have to deal with this in the manner, which we talk about junk food

01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:05.400
[Guest]: Or whether we talk about in the manner we discuss cocaine

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:08.340
[Guest]: That's the main issue

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:14.180
[Guest]: Now the problem is that cocaine and junk food are on a very simple spectrum stuff we ingest

01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:17.220
[Guest]: These are ideas. We are talking about

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:21.380
[Guest]: News of fake material put out there to affect the way

01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:26.500
[Guest]: Countries function, which is the most recent thing. But before that we were talking about harassment

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:30.900
[Guest]: There's been a very innovative way which moderators were harassed recently for

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:36.180
[Guest]: When avengers released people started putting spoilers of avengers

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:39.940
[Guest]: Spoilers of avengers infinity war all over the place, right?

01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:47.060
[Guest]: And since you're now that in that will always hurt moderators more because the moment you see it you're like crap spoiler block

01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:49.780
[Guest]: But every mod who comes back to that thread

01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:53.460
[Guest]: We'll see the spoiler because those while it's blocked for normal users

01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:58.020
[Guest]: Everyone else all the other mods can see it. They can see all the other comments which have been removed

01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:02.660
[Guest]: You can always review what's happened and for all the users who didn't know you could do this. You've now told them well done

01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:04.740
[Amit Varma]: Hey Bhagwan cancel remove

01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:06.740
[Amit Varma]: We shall censor this portion, right?

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:10.340
[Amit Varma]: but we were broadly talking about online conversations and the way uh,

01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:15.060
[Amit Varma]: we as society the way we interact with each other has changed because of uh,

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:20.500
[Amit Varma]: Changed actually in front of our eyes in our in our uh, yeah, very fast respective lifespans

01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:25.140
[Amit Varma]: Uh, so i'm going to end the episode by i'm asking you two questions. So you've struck a note of

01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:30.340
[Amit Varma]: Despair in this but the two questions I tend to ask my guests before they leave

01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:34.340
[Amit Varma]: Uh in in the context of the subject is what makes you hopeful?

01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:39.700
[Amit Varma]: About um the internet and what it can do for society and what makes you despair?

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:42.900
[Guest]: Most of it makes me despair, right?

01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:46.420
[Guest]: Is anything let's move on to the slightly more hopeful part there

01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:51.460
[Guest]: So there are parts which work and these are almost always the parts which involve

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:55.540
[Guest]: Curation and effort. So one of the subreddits which works really well

01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:58.260
[Guest]: Is change my view?

01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:01.140
[Guest]: and change my view is a very neat subreddit because

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:04.340
[Guest]: They have a bunch of rules and they have a very constrained

01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:07.620
[Guest]: Format and the format is that you must ask a question

01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:14.340
[Guest]: You must state your view and you must want and be relatively genuine in wanting that view changed

01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:16.020
[Guest]: and

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:21.460
[Guest]: The first response in general has to be someone making a serious stab at attempting to change your view

01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:24.180
[Guest]: this is sort of the part where

01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:27.380
[Guest]: This is what remains of what our hope for the internet was

01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.820
[Guest]: because

01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:34.980
[Guest]: Instead of being this really large place where everyone gets together and meets and shares idea. It's become this very large set of

01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:43.220
[Guest]: Fragile eggshells where people go inside and they stay there and look outside and look at other people and abuse and say everyone

01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:45.220
[Guest]: Who's inside that egg is horrible

01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:51.380
[Guest]: Change my view is this place where people the few people who actually have an open mind or actually may be willing to have their

01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:52.820
[Guest]: Minds changed

01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:54.820
[Guest]: Show up and they say okay

01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:58.740
[Guest]: Okay, I am in a position in my life where I am thinking about this thing

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:03.140
[Guest]: Give me a way to change my attitude or change my thing and that's the place where I see

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:09.860
[Amit Varma]: What remains of what we actually intended or hoped the internet would be is there a correlation between on the one hand the level?

01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:11.620
[Amit Varma]: and quality of curation

01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:13.620
[Amit Varma]: And on the other hand the popularity

01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:18.900
[Guest]: well, if you say quality of curation and popularity for sure because um

01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:22.340
[Guest]: It's very

01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:27.780
[Guest]: If you have a good topic and you have a way to say that this is how we're going to curate for it

01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:30.360
[Guest]: Quite often you'll have decent amounts of popularity

01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:32.900
[Guest]: So yes in a way they are related

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:37.860
[Guest]: But then you can also be a very good curator on a very boring topic and no one will come there and also that's within reddit

01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:45.220
[Amit Varma]: Reddit already is a self-selected community of people who have come there and registered because they want to interact and they want to engage

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:51.140
[Amit Varma]: while people on facebook and twitter and so on are just passive consumers or whatever is being fed to them and

01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:54.340
[Amit Varma]: Often in very manipulative ways like you pointed out correctly

01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:56.260
[Amit Varma]: um

01:29:56.260 --> 01:30:00.180
[Amit Varma]: And and and the facebooks and twitters of the world are way larger than even

01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:05.540
[Guest]: Reddit so reddit is not on the radar for a majority of people right

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:09.060
[Guest]: It shows and frankly reddit has a is notorious

01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:13.780
[Guest]: It quite often shows up for all the wrong reasons, which is another reason why a lot of people want to have

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:18.180
[Guest]: Restrictions on free speech there used to be old subreddits like jailbait

01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:24.020
[Guest]: Which literally had pictures of people of well, well, let's just say borderline

01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:28.100
[Guest]: images of young people which were borderline pedophilia that all

01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:35.940
[Guest]: Went down in a bundle of flames eventually when people said this is not okay, but that's the sort of side of free speech

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:41.460
[Amit Varma]: And so in fact that thought comes to my mind that i'm not hinting at something about you here

01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:48.500
[Amit Varma]: But isn't being a reddit moderator the perfect job for someone who likes child porn because they'll get to see a lot of it

01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:50.580
[Amit Varma]: Even if they have to delete it, they'll get to see it

01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:53.860
[Guest]: no, fortunately reddit, uh at this point of time and

01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:57.160
[Guest]: generally because of its attitude of consolidating information

01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:58.660
[Guest]: has

01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:00.180
[Guest]: managed to

01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:04.660
[Guest]: Always keep people in silos. So unless you were interested in that you would not find it in the first place

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.460
[Amit Varma]: Excellent. I'll just I was just pulling your leg

01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:13.460
[Amit Varma]: Uh, thank you. Thanks a lot for this conversation. I've you've given me a lot of things to think about

01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:15.060
[Amit Varma]: and

01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:20.020
