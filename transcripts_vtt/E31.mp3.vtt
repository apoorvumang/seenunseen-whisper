00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.320
[Amit Varma]: I had a bad dream the other day, I dreamed I died and went to hell, a very large demon

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.500
[Amit Varma]: with orange hair and a 56 inch chest let me in and said, go forth and suffer, I went forth

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.220
[Amit Varma]: and as soon as I entered hell, I fell into a pothole, it was full of dirty water, I somehow

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.940
[Amit Varma]: clambered out and walked over to a roadside restaurant, it was a hot day, there was no

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.260
[Amit Varma]: electricity there, I was sweating like a pig, I asked the waiter for some water, he said

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.140
[Amit Varma]: there was no water in the taps, I got up to go, I walked out and I fell into a pothole

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.100
[Amit Varma]: again, as I clambered out, the large demon with orange hair and a 56 inch chest came

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.900
[Amit Varma]: and stood in front of me, I asked him, what's going on man, what kind of hell is this, where

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.020
[Amit Varma]: is the eternal fire, where are the torture instruments, what kind of hell is this, he

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.680
[Amit Varma]: laughed and replied, this is hell 2.0, it is a new improved version, we based it on

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:17.220
[Amit Varma]: Indian urban governance, muahahahaha!

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.660
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.980
[Amit Varma]: science, please welcome your host, Amit Bhadwa.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.780
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen, in today's episode, I will explore why urban governance

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.500
[Amit Varma]: in India's cities is so abysmal, my guest for today is Shruti Rajgopalan, an economist

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.940
[Amit Varma]: and lawyer who teaches economics in Purchase College in New York, welcome to the show Shruti.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.100
[Amit Varma]: Hi Amit, thanks for having me, Shruti, you were born and brought up in Delhi, yes, and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.860
[Amit Varma]: you come to Bombay very often and now of course you live in New York, so every time you visit

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.660
[Amit Varma]: India as you are now, thankfully you are in Mumbai right now at my studio, what is your

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.420
[Amit Varma]: impression of Delhi and Mumbai, how have these cities changed over the years?

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.260
[Guest]: So one, the cities have really grown, both Delhi and Mumbai are now the greater Delhi

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.100
[Guest]: area and the greater Mumbai area, so they have sort of spread both in a geographical

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.140
[Guest]: area in size and also in terms of how many people live there.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.820
[Guest]: The other thing is I find that people are actually richer, so people in Delhi per capita

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.460
[Guest]: seem to have more cars, more goods and services, so there are some things where there's a very

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.780
[Guest]: clear marked improvement, but if you ask about the city infrastructure, even though it seems

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.820
[Guest]: that there is a lot of construction and the government always seems to be building some

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.660
[Guest]: metro or monorail or flyover or something like that, the infrastructure hasn't kept

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.380
[Guest]: up with the demand for that infrastructure, it's always lagging behind and even before

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.020
[Guest]: a road is built, it is congested, so it's clearly not built keeping in mind excess capacity

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.980
[Guest]: for how the city will look three, you know, three years from now, 30 years from now, 300

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.980
[Amit Varma]: years from now.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.540
[Guest]: It's always reactive, you're chasing the demands.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.940
[Guest]: Exactly, so that's one part of it, while I say that the infrastructure, there's some

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.640
[Guest]: work going on and it's improved and it hasn't kept up, I actually find a lot of other services

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.260
[Guest]: much worse, I feel like garbage collection is worse than it used to be, even though Delhi

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.740
[Guest]: has built so many new roads and I'm guessing it must be similar for Bombay, they just seem

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.980
[Guest]: to forget to build things like sidewalks and stormwater drains or pedestrian walkways,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.580
[Guest]: there's nowhere for a regular person to walk or for a bus to stop and for regular folks

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.780
[Guest]: to get on, so all the activity just spills onto the streets and causes more congestion,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.780
[Guest]: so there clearly seems to be some kind of a service delivery problem, either because

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:58.220
[Guest]: the city governors or those responsible don't really understand what people need or because

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.820
[Guest]: there's no reason to provide it and it's just easier to build a flyover than to build public

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.540
[Guest]: facilities and toilets and you know, things like that.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.540
[Amit Varma]: And our urban governance has been shoddy for so long that we almost take it for granted,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.080
[Amit Varma]: like just before we started recording, Josh, our producer, was talking about how someone

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.420
[Amit Varma]: asked him the other day that, you know, the trains in Bombay have no doors, really?

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.220
[Amit Varma]: And that's just something we take for granted, we don't think twice about it, but the fact

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.340
[Amit Varma]: is around nine people die every day on Bombay's locals and it's just a throwaway statistic

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.500
[Amit Varma]: as if it doesn't matter at all and all through these years, urban governance has never really

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.380
[Amit Varma]: improved even though India's focus should really be on the cities, I mean, one third

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.380
[Amit Varma]: of India already lives in cities, which is a number which is going to grow by 2050 as

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.700
[Amit Varma]: you pointed out in your recent paper, 70% of the world will live in cities, which is

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.180
[Amit Varma]: natural because people gravitate to cities from poorer areas because there are greater

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.380
[Amit Varma]: economic networks, therefore more opportunities, more productivity, a better life, you know,

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.060
[Amit Varma]: people might idolize the rural life, but very seldom do people travel in the other direction.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.940
[Amit Varma]: It's always migration to cities.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.940
[Amit Varma]: So you would imagine with so much of an inward movement into cities, that there is also pressure

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.700
[Amit Varma]: from the people to the government to deliver good urban governance.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.980
[Guest]: What are the reasons it is not happening?

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.680
[Guest]: So let me unpack the big questions into a few smaller bits.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.580
[Guest]: So first, you're absolutely right, the cities is where the future is, it's already happening

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.580
[Guest]: now.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.420
[Guest]: We are in the midst of the greatest migration in human history, except that that greatest

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.460
[Guest]: migration is happening within borders of nations.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.920
[Guest]: So it's already started and it's accelerated in China, and it's happening in India.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.740
[Guest]: So by 2030, 600 million people in India will live in cities.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.020
[Guest]: Right now, the number is just a little over 350 million.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.020
[Guest]: So either the number of cities need to double or our cities need to grow twice in size to

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.540
[Guest]: accommodate these people and everything that they have to offer.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.340
[Guest]: The second part of it, as you rightly pointed out, is that these cities are also going to

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.140
[Guest]: be the drivers of economic growth and productivity.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.780
[Guest]: So I've always held the belief that people are not poor, it's just people are trapped

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.500
[Guest]: in low productivity and poor areas.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.660
[Guest]: The exact same worker who is trapped in a low productivity area in the village comes

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.060
[Guest]: to the city, finds work and his wages immediately double or triple or quadruple, right?

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.400
[Guest]: And that's the reason to come to cities.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.700
[Guest]: So the great migration in total is an excellent thing for India and for Indians to get out

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.260
[Guest]: of this sort of poverty trap.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.700
[Guest]: Now having said that, this also puts a lot of stress on urban governance.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:44.420
[Guest]: And people who are migrating may not be, it may not be their top priority to demand urban

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.420
[Guest]: governance.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.160
[Guest]: They sort of just showed up in a city like Mumbai and they're just trying to make a living.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.580
[Guest]: If making a living involves taking a train, which is almost a death wish to get to work

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.940
[Guest]: and get back, that's what they do because that's what they need to do to get to work

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.180
[Guest]: on time, right?

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.220
[Guest]: They have fewer choices.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.620
[Guest]: People who are already settled and entrenched in cities, such as you've been living in Bombay

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.620
[Amit Varma]: for a long time.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.260
[Amit Varma]: We've become apathetic to all this.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.380
[Guest]: So technically you are the people who are more likely to demand better governance and

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.900
[Guest]: some of that does happen.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.620
[Guest]: But as you said, a lot of apathy and you just get used to it.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.700
[Guest]: And more importantly, all of us have found our own juggards, right?

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:29.100
[Guest]: So if the garbage collection provided by the state doesn't work very well, the resident

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.580
[Guest]: society or association figures out a way to have some kind of garbage association and

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.980
[Guest]: collects a small fee for it.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.940
[Guest]: I see this happening in all sorts of suburbs all over the place.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.180
[Guest]: So between these two things, because people do have to get on with their life, right?

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.220
[Guest]: Everything can't be a big protest over everyday issues.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.620
[Guest]: I think that's sort of the trap that's going on in terms of the demand side of things.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:59.180
[Guest]: The other part of it is there is something a little messed up going on structurally in

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:05.340
[Guest]: terms of how we have set up urban local bodies or municipalities, which are actually supposed

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.980
[Guest]: to be responsible for city governance.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.460
[Guest]: We have created these urban local bodies through a constitutional amendment in the mid-nineties.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.580
[Guest]: Having said that, we democratized it.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.700
[Guest]: We created an entire layer of elected officials and also staffed bureaucrats to help those

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.700
[Guest]: officials.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:30.100
[Guest]: But we gave them no authority and we gave them no revenue raising ability, which basically

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.740
[Guest]: means we have an entire new layer of government, which is essentially toothless.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.580
[Guest]: And this is the most important layer of government in my mind when it comes to delivering services

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.080
[Guest]: to people, especially if most of the people in the country are eventually going to live

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.160
[Guest]: in cities.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.460
[Guest]: So I think that structural problem that we have in the Indian federal system is what

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:56.180
[Guest]: needs to be addressed, because even though Delhi's problems might be stormwater drains

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.300
[Guest]: and Mumbai's problems might be roads and Surat's might be garbage collection or something else,

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.460
[Guest]: it's actually the same problem structurally.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.860
[Guest]: It's the governance delivery mechanism which is broken.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.860
[Amit Varma]: So let me go through that again.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.340
[Amit Varma]: Now typically, people who believe in governance would say local government is a great thing,

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.840
[Amit Varma]: especially if there's democracy, because your leaders are accountable to you.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.540
[Amit Varma]: You elect your local corporators, councillors, whoever, and you hold them accountable.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.660
[Amit Varma]: If they don't deliver, if they don't collect the garbage, if they don't clear out the potholes

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.820
[Amit Varma]: outside, then you vote them out.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.820
[Amit Varma]: But where you are saying the system is broken is that yes, you vote them in and out, but

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.340
[Amit Varma]: they are powerless because they can't, A, they don't raise their own funds and B, often

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.340
[Amit Varma]: they don't have the power to actually affect the kind of change which you elect them to

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.760
[Amit Varma]: do.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.540
[Guest]: So how does the system work then?

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:48.500
[Guest]: Okay, so India is a federal country, or when we used to be young and we had these civics

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.860
[Guest]: textbooks, it used to have this throwaway line, India is a federal nation with a unitary

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:59.100
[Guest]: bias, which I never knew what it meant until I grew older.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.940
[Guest]: And now I realize it means that India is not federal.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.900
[Guest]: It just has a lot of states.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:10.300
[Guest]: But the way the Indian Federation was set up was there was a far greater level of centralization

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.900
[Guest]: than say many other federal countries like the United States.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.300
[Guest]: Now the way the Indian Federation was set up was while you have state elections and

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.880
[Guest]: local elections and so on, it is not fiscally federal, right?

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.820
[Guest]: This means that there was a body that was created when the constitution was adopted

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.900
[Guest]: called the Finance Commission.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.940
[Guest]: The revenue that was collected all over the country would be centralized and then the

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:40.420
[Guest]: Finance Commission would determine how much of that revenue needs to go back to which

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.660
[Guest]: state and which area.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.660
[Guest]: This basically means that the link between where the revenue is collected and where the

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:53.800
[Guest]: expenditure is made is broken, which is normally not the case with local government.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:59.180
[Guest]: Now note that when the Indian constitution was adopted, there was no such thing as an

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.980
[Guest]: urban local government constitutionally.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.560
[Guest]: There was no provision for local governments.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.220
[Guest]: The simple assumption was state governments will take care of it.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.220
[Guest]: Like why wouldn't they?

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.460
[Guest]: And every state is different.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.820
[Guest]: Some of them are more rural.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.820
[Guest]: Some of them are more urban.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:17.620
[Amit Varma]: So the assumption was the states would have these local arms as a voter, your voice really

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.940
[Guest]: is to elect your chief minister.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:20.940
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:26.460
[Guest]: Then through the decades, they figured out that this kind of centralization is really

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:31.140
[Guest]: hurting local governance, most importantly the villages.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.220
[Guest]: So there was a huge push to have local level institutions.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.820
[Guest]: This was a fairly revolutionary move at the time and even today.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.980
[Guest]: So this happened through the 73rd amendment, which set up panchayati raj institutions in

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:49.260
[Guest]: rural areas and the 74th amendment, which set up ULBs or urban local bodies in urban

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.820
[Guest]: areas.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.180
[Guest]: Now what the 73rd and the 74th amendment did, if you actually look at the text of these

00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:01.780
[Guest]: amendments, it sets up in detail what that government structure would look like.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.340
[Guest]: How will these people be elected?

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.700
[Guest]: How many of those seats will be reserved versus general seats?

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.840
[Guest]: How many of the different categories you will have?

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.420
[Guest]: How many women?

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.780
[Guest]: Once you elect them, there is a long list of responsibilities.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:19.020
[Guest]: So the way you have the seventh schedule, which gives you the union state and concurrent

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:24.580
[Guest]: list, which determines what the central government and the state governments can legislate upon.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:29.260
[Guest]: There was something introduced called the 12th schedule, which had details of all the

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.500
[Guest]: areas such as, you know, town planning, garbage collection, all the things that local governments

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.780
[Guest]: must take care of.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.660
[Guest]: So all this was very clearly drafted and specified.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.700
[Guest]: Having said that, there was one crucial problem with the 73rd and the 74th amendment.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.820
[Guest]: The way you have a central finance commission, which splits the money between the central

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.860
[Guest]: government and various states, they enabled an entire new set of finance commissions called

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.180
[Guest]: the state finance commission.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.940
[Guest]: So Maharashtra will have one, Gujarat will have one.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:03.060
[Guest]: And these finance commissions only have recommending power, they don't have any authority to execute

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.060
[Guest]: their recommendations.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:09.540
[Guest]: So they recommend to the state legislature how much of the revenue will be split between

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.780
[Guest]: the state government and the local governments.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.820
[Guest]: In this case, they are panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:22.900
[Guest]: Now despite repeated recommendations by various state finance commissions, the amount or the

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:28.020
[Guest]: percentage of the revenue which is actually devolved to the lowest level of government

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.500
[Guest]: is very small.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.620
[Guest]: That's one.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.700
[Guest]: The second issue is it's extremely arbitrary and not consistent.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.140
[Guest]: So some of the governments actually devolve a fair bit.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.540
[Guest]: Sometimes they'll do it as a one time thing because of the push from the central government

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.580
[Guest]: or something like that.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.900
[Guest]: And then the next year, it won't happen or it stops.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:56.900
[Guest]: So if you just think about the way fiscal theory works, you can raise your own money,

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.700
[Guest]: you know, by actually collecting taxes.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:03.580
[Guest]: You can raise it through bonds or by the state issuing bonds and going into debt.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:08.020
[Guest]: Or you can get it through intergovernmental transfer, which is the, you know, what the

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.020
[Guest]: finance commission does.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.540
[Guest]: It gives money from the center to the states, it transfers money between states.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.340
[Guest]: State finance commissions give money from state to local government.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:21.260
[Guest]: The theory suggests, and this is played out empirically everywhere, that the less you

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:27.580
[Guest]: rely on intergovernmental transfers, the better it is, simply because intergovernmental transfers

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:33.140
[Guest]: break the link between the citizen and the people who are governing those citizens.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.140
[Guest]: Right.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.260
[Guest]: So let me give you an example.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:41.780
[Guest]: Now let's say that the residents of Khar, where we are recording this, actually want

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.420
[Guest]: sidewalks to be built and want better garbage collection.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.380
[Guest]: Those are their top two demands.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:52.340
[Guest]: And you have some kind of a municipal authority and someone from Khar is a representative

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.340
[Guest]: there.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.820
[Guest]: Now he's elected by these people.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.180
[Guest]: He will take all the demands to the powers that be.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:04.140
[Guest]: Now since he doesn't control his own purse strings and he has no revenue raising authority,

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:10.220
[Guest]: he finally needs to please some bureaucrat in the government of Maharashtra to allot

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.880
[Guest]: those funds.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:21.380
[Guest]: So now let's say the bureaucrat wants a flyover named after Ambedkar, okay?

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.860
[Guest]: And that's his preference.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.740
[Guest]: Remember, initially we started out with the citizen's preference was garbage collection

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.420
[Guest]: and building of sidewalks.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.700
[Guest]: Now whose preference should he cater to?

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.820
[Guest]: The representative from Khar.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.980
[Guest]: The people who voted for him want one thing and the person who's going to give him the

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.220
[Guest]: money wants something completely different.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:45.060
[Guest]: So one is he has all this responsibility and he can be removed in the next election and

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.180
[Guest]: so on, but he doesn't have much power.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:53.220
[Guest]: He needs to finally bow down before someone else and that someone else is not the voters

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.940
[Guest]: or the taxpayers.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:16:00.180
[Guest]: Second is all these fine residents of Khar are actually paying taxes and they think that

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.260
[Guest]: their taxes should fetch them all these local services, but their taxes actually go towards

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.100
[Guest]: building the Ambedkar flyover in Malad instead of Khar.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.100
[Guest]: Why?

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.180
[Guest]: Because the bureaucrat or the legislator in Maharashtra wanted an Ambedkar flyover in

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.680
[Guest]: Malad.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.100
[Guest]: So that's exactly what ends up happening.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.020
[Guest]: You have extremely disgruntled voters.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.780
[Guest]: You have extremely disgruntled taxpayers.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:29.100
[Guest]: All that money is being spent and yet the actual connection between our demand for a

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.040
[Guest]: specific service and the supply of that specific service is broken.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.940
[Amit Varma]: So let me unpack it for a moment from the perspective of incentives.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:41.100
[Amit Varma]: Usually if you had an accountable local government, you would have a corporator who has the budgets

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.020
[Amit Varma]: he needs to do whatever and his incentives are to please the people who elected him and

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.260
[Amit Varma]: to give them what they want, which in this case is a sidewalk and the garbage collection.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.700
[Amit Varma]: However, that is not his incentive because he doesn't hold the purse strings.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.100
[Amit Varma]: His incentive is to please the bureaucrat or the legislator.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.580
[Amit Varma]: The bureaucrat's incentives will be something different entirely.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.820
[Amit Varma]: It might be to build a flyover in Malad where he gets kickbacks from the contractor and

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.820
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:10.180
[Amit Varma]: All the incentives are messed up simply because of fiscal purse strings are not where they

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.180
[Guest]: should be.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.180
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:18.060
[Guest]: I think it's a very, very important principle of governance, which we never really appreciated

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:23.780
[Guest]: much in India and it seems to be completely lost now, that there needs to be democratic

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.420
[Guest]: accountability and also fiscal accountability.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:34.380
[Guest]: India is a very, very staunchly democratic country at every level of governance.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.180
[Guest]: You actually see people showing up to elect representatives at local elections and panchayati

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.180
[Guest]: raj elections.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.060
[Guest]: We are very democratically inclined.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.060
[Guest]: Indians like to vote.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.060
[Guest]: They like to protest.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.540
[Amit Varma]: They like to register their voice.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.060
[Amit Varma]: And we do have an involved citizenry.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.900
[Guest]: You should look at the people in my society.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.900
[Guest]: Yes.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.860
[Guest]: You have a very involved citizenry.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:58.480
[Guest]: Having said that, given that it's not a fiscally devolved state or we seem to have lost the

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:03.580
[Guest]: concept of fiscal accountability and all the fiscal governance is completely centralized

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:09.180
[Guest]: in New Delhi or in the state capital of every state and it's not being further devolved

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:15.500
[Guest]: to the people, the link between the voice, which represents a democratically in the voting

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:20.680
[Guest]: booth and the actual payment that accompanies it in local taxes is completely broken.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.100
[Guest]: So that is one very big part of the problem.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:29.320
[Guest]: The other very big part of the problem is this kind of heavy reliance on intergovernmental

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.460
[Guest]: transfers.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:35.660
[Guest]: So what happens right now, I see a lot of disgruntled people in Mumbai whose taxes are

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.220
[Guest]: going to be spent on loan waivers in UP.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.780
[Guest]: This is a typical intergovernmental transfer problem.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.800
[Guest]: So the money that is raised in Mumbai that even within the current system should technically

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.500
[Guest]: go to the coffers of Maharashtra government and then come back to the people of Maharashtra,

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:57.720
[Guest]: even if not just Mumbai, now actually goes away centrally to a different pool and then

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.260
[Guest]: goes to other states which don't have the same revenue raising capacity as Mumbai because

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:07.260
[Guest]: they're not as productive in terms of, you know, urban areas as Mumbai is and it goes

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.860
[Guest]: to loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.180
[Guest]: So this is the other reason for being disgruntled.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.500
[Guest]: We have people paying taxes and we have people registering their voices.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.900
[Amit Varma]: You could say no wonder people want to evade taxes and don't take the responsibility seriously

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.220
[Guest]: because they're like, look, I'm not getting banked for my buck.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.220
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.740
[Guest]: So that's the unintended consequence of this.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:31.900
[Guest]: On the face of it, it looks like we live in a regular democracy and a regular federal

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.860
[Guest]: nation and there's local governance.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:38.420
[Guest]: But actually when you unpack the structure of it, we do live in a democracy, but we have

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:44.140
[Guest]: no federalism because all federalism needs to be backed by fiscal federalism.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.660
[Guest]: So if you give the power and the responsibility to various layers of government and finally

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:55.300
[Guest]: you don't devolve the revenue raising capacity, that kind of federalism is absolutely meaningless.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.020
[Amit Varma]: The essential thing here is that the power and the responsibility should be with the

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.200
[Amit Varma]: same person.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.940
[Amit Varma]: And here you have the local corporator you elect having the responsibility, but the power

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.380
[Amit Varma]: being with someone else who is not accountable in any way.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.460
[Guest]: So let me just tweak what you said a little bit.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:13.980
[Guest]: In a country that's both democratic and fiscally federal, the power is always with the people.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.780
[Guest]: It's not with the corporator or the legislator.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:23.220
[Guest]: So they have the power to either vote you out or to protest when taxes are raised to

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.020
[Guest]: claim loan waiver somewhere else.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.940
[Guest]: So if you keep raising taxes without giving the residents of Khar their garbage disposal

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:36.460
[Guest]: and stormwater drains and sidewalk, then they'll stop voting for you and they'll protest any

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.460
[Guest]: kind of tax increase.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.780
[Guest]: And that is what is broken in India.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:45.700
[Guest]: So just to put this in perspective, since you asked about governance, my parents moved

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.260
[Guest]: to Noida to a beautiful condo association.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:56.340
[Guest]: That condo association has incredible politics, which is fascinating for me to watch.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:03.420
[Guest]: Every decision on the maintenance of the generator, should we put a new water filtering unit,

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.980
[Guest]: should we have speed breakers in front of every individual building within the larger

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.420
[Guest]: complex because, you know, there are kids that come back from school and you don't want

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.340
[Guest]: cars driving fast.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:21.220
[Guest]: Every decision is vigorously debated with a lot of, you know, high emotion when you

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.460
[Guest]: go to the association meetings and you think about it and you're like, why isn't all this

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.100
[Guest]: emotion seen anywhere else?

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.500
[Guest]: It's because they know that their voice will be heard and they pay maintenance fees and

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.280
[Guest]: they want to get banged for their buck.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.500
[Guest]: And whoever is the local elected representative is their neighbor.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.300
[Guest]: He'll have no choice but to hear them and to execute the wishes of the larger group

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.300
[Amit Varma]: of people.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.300
[Amit Varma]: This energy would be wasted anywhere else except within this association.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.300
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:54.620
[Guest]: So now if I think about it, there are about, I believe, 3,000 flats and, you know, a little

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.460
[Guest]: over 10,000 residents in that particular condo association.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.700
[Guest]: And it has a lot of small and big governance problems.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.380
[Guest]: I mean, it maintains its own parks.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.380
[Guest]: It has its own roads.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.980
[Guest]: It has its own parking garage.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.460
[Guest]: It has its own power backup unit.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:12.700
[Guest]: So it's not really running a city, but it's like running a tiny neighborhood, a microcosm

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.140
[Guest]: of a city.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.740
[Guest]: And so the problems are the same at a smaller scale.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:23.920
[Guest]: And because it is more local and the people who are voting are also paying maintenance

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.620
[Guest]: fee for the condo association, which is a sort of tax equivalent in this case, they

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.340
[Guest]: are able to demand their service delivery.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:37.020
[Guest]: And when I see that in action, so my recommendation is not that we should move everything to condo

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.020
[Guest]: associations.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.820
[Guest]: That's not where I'm going with this.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:48.900
[Guest]: The insight I would take from this example is simply that you need to make both the voice

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:56.180
[Guest]: and the taxpaying or the revenue raising ability to be aligned in purpose and between the same

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.820
[Guest]: groups of people for the whole system to work.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:22:59.820
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:05.100
[Amit Varma]: So my next obvious follow up question then is that what are the changes we need to see,

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.140
[Amit Varma]: which I presume are just, you know, getting the fiscal reins into the hands of whoever

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.140
[Amit Varma]: you elect locally and how likely are they to happen?

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.140
[Amit Varma]: What are the interest groups against that?

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.940
[Guest]: And you know, what is the process?

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:16.940
[Guest]: Okay.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:24.000
[Guest]: So, you know, structurally, the system that we have in India is such that no one is mandating

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.460
[Guest]: that you need to devolve more revenue downstream.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:32.380
[Guest]: Having said that, there is nothing in the system that prevents any government from doing

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.380
[Guest]: so.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:39.060
[Guest]: It is possible tomorrow for the parliament to say that the Finance Commission is going

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.660
[Guest]: to only leave 10% to the centre and 90% to the states.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.220
[Guest]: There's nothing that stops them from legislating on that.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.980
[Guest]: Similarly, there's nothing that stops the states from legislating that we will have

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:53.660
[Guest]: 30% with the state government and 70% with the local government.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.340
[Guest]: So it's a question of devolution.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.340
[Guest]: It's not mandated.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.420
[Guest]: Who appoints the Finance Commission?

00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.500
[Guest]: Who appoints it?

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.500
[Guest]: It's a constitutional body.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.500
[Guest]: Okay.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.500
[Guest]: Right.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.900
[Guest]: And they are, they only have recommendatory power.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.780
[Amit Varma]: They don't have any power to execute.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.760
[Amit Varma]: I'm talking about the Central Finance Commission.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.760
[Amit Varma]: So who appoints it?

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.220
[Guest]: I'm trying to figure out their incentives, deciding upon what the devolution should be.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.620
[Guest]: Oh, think of them as high level bureaucrats and technocrats.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.740
[Guest]: So it's not an elected body.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.380
[Guest]: It's usually filled with experts.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.820
[Guest]: And of course, every government has, you know, a few favoured people that they believe have

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.180
[Guest]: the right voice and so on.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.380
[Guest]: And they look for them.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.940
[Guest]: Having said that, the Finance Commission is actually an excellent body in that they invite

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:38.900
[Guest]: a lot of recommendations from various interests, state, city, local, they write a detailed

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.060
[Guest]: Finance Commission report.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:45.180
[Guest]: So you know, you have, you can go online and have access from the first to the most recent

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.500
[Guest]: Finance Commission reports.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.100
[Guest]: So it's actually an excellent body.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:54.820
[Guest]: So we don't have the typical like corrupt politician bureaucrat kind of problem with

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.820
[Guest]: them.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:00.280
[Guest]: The problem is everything that they recommend is typically not heard.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:05.580
[Guest]: So every time the Finance Commission has said we need greater devolution of revenues and

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:10.420
[Guest]: resources, nobody in the legislature has any incentive to follow that.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.820
[Guest]: So that is really the problem.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.820
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.460
[Amit Varma]: And just to just to like come to the Maharashtra level, I often hear people complaining about

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:20.580
[Amit Varma]: how so much tax is generated in Mumbai for the state, most of them are, but it goes out

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.940
[Amit Varma]: into the rural areas, because that's where the legislators' votes comes from.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:25.940
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:26.940
[Amit Varma]: So that's natural.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.940
[Amit Varma]: Those are the incentives at play.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.940
[Guest]: And that is what they will do.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:29.940
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.900
[Guest]: So here, I think the problem is more the incentives of the legislature, right?

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:38.380
[Guest]: So this problem, some people will believe will get very quickly resolved, because the

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.140
[Guest]: largest number of people are going to live in urban areas.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.060
[Guest]: So very soon, this problem ought to solve itself.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:49.020
[Guest]: Having said that, we are in the midst of the greatest migration.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.620
[Guest]: Most people don't live where they're registered to vote while they're moving from rural to

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.620
[Guest]: urban areas.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.140
[Guest]: It's not like you and me who've lived in the same place for 10 years, and so on, so forth.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:01.500
[Guest]: So it's difficult for them to come to a new place and find, I mean, most people in Mumbai

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:06.100
[Guest]: don't even have a pakka address, you know, the migrants, they just come and they have

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:10.060
[Guest]: friends and family and some social networks that they stay with for a little while and

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.500
[Guest]: then figure out their own housing situation.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:17.640
[Guest]: So the migrants, even though they're increasing in number, they are not going to be the ones

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.780
[Guest]: who register as increasing in number of votes.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.140
[Guest]: So that is something that we need to keep in mind.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.700
[Guest]: So that's a force which will eventually even out.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:32.540
[Guest]: But while we're in the process of urbanization, I don't see more people coming to the cities

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.800
[Guest]: necessarily translating as more votes.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.100
[Guest]: So that's one.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:40.220
[Guest]: I think the revenue raising ability of cities is only going to grow.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.660
[Guest]: Having said that, while the cities do raise a lot of revenue, we need to figure out a

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.860
[Guest]: way by which the cities get to spend that revenue within.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.600
[Guest]: So right now, we have some interesting data.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.800
[Guest]: So you have three kinds of urban local bodies.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.180
[Guest]: So you have municipal corporations, which are the largest, you know, something like

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:04.900
[Guest]: the BMC or the Delhi Municipal Corporation, so on.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.180
[Guest]: Then you have municipalities, which are the next level, they're smaller.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:14.220
[Guest]: And then you have nagar panchayat, which is like the really small, semi urban sort of

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.900
[Guest]: areas.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.960
[Guest]: Now this is an interesting detail.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.460
[Guest]: Think about your own sources of revenue and other sources of revenue.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:27.200
[Guest]: So your own sources of revenue is what you raised through property and local taxes.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.460
[Guest]: Other sources of revenue is what you get through intergovernmental transfers.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:34.540
[Guest]: The debt raising ability of most urban local governments is very small.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.980
[Guest]: So we'll leave that out of it for the moment.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:43.180
[Guest]: So if you're a large municipal corporation like the BMC and the Delhi government, Delhi

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:47.260
[Guest]: municipality, you have, which is I think the MCD.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:52.140
[Guest]: You raise almost 65 to 70% of your own revenue.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:57.420
[Guest]: If you are a municipality, which is the next smaller local urban local government, it's

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.620
[Guest]: about between 25 to 30%.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:05.620
[Guest]: And if you're a nagar panchayat, you are raising only about 20% of your own revenue.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.700
[Guest]: So now just think about these numbers.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:14.100
[Guest]: If you're raising only 20% of your revenue from your constituents, or your taxpayers,

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:20.060
[Guest]: and hopefully they're the same or they should be the same, then 80% has to come from somewhere

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.060
[Guest]: else.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:24.460
[Guest]: That is either a central government bureaucrat or a state government bureaucrat.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:29.860
[Guest]: So 80% of the spend is determined by somebody else and only 20% is determined by the residents

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.060
[Guest]: who actually voted for you.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.140
[Guest]: This creates the big mismatch.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:39.860
[Guest]: So now what I see in the future is a small nagar panchayat, which organically should

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:45.340
[Guest]: eventually grow into a municipality, and eventually into a large municipal corporation, is never

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:50.900
[Guest]: going to be able to do so unless the intergovernmental transfer system supports it.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:55.660
[Guest]: And right now, where is the incentive for the powers that be at the centre and state

00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:01.900
[Guest]: to say, I'm going to give a disproportionately large amount of money to a very small city,

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.480
[Guest]: hoping that it will become a very big city.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.540
[Guest]: That incentive absolutely doesn't exist.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:12.960
[Guest]: So what happens, more money goes to established cities, there is no money spent on creating

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:21.300
[Guest]: new urban capacity, and there is no money or no effort spent on increasing local revenue.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:26.100
[Guest]: The other part of this is, urban local bodies actually don't end up spending all the money

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.020
[Guest]: that they raise.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.580
[Guest]: And when you actually, I haven't done so myself, but there are other people who've written

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:36.940
[Guest]: papers and surveyed all these local corporators and so on, and they ask them, you have all

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.180
[Guest]: this money, why haven't you spent it?

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:46.340
[Guest]: And they say, we don't have any idea on whether this source of revenue is reliable.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.620
[Guest]: We got some one-time money from the state government, we got some one-time money from

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.760
[Guest]: the federal government, and we don't know if we'll come again in the future.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.540
[Guest]: So we can't start a big infrastructure or a governance project.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.220
[Guest]: So we just let the money sit.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.540
[Guest]: Which is a very sensible thing to do, because if you start doing something and you can't

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:08.500
[Guest]: finish it, it's highly visible, and the voters will vote you out.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.860
[Guest]: If you just don't do anything and the state of affairs is as they were yesterday, and

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.900
[Guest]: no promises were made and no promises were broken, you are less likely to get booted

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.900
[Amit Varma]: out.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.300
[Amit Varma]: And people continue with the inertia and apathy.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.300
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.100
[Guest]: So this is sort of the way the current system works at the moment.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:29.500
[Amit Varma]: So for a moment, contrast the state of Bombay and Delhi, which has the same structural deficiency

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:34.500
[Amit Varma]: that you just described, with the city where you now live, New York, how is it different?

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:39.500
[Guest]: I don't have the exact data for New York City off the top of my head.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:47.740
[Guest]: So first, first things first, the United States is far more federal and far more fiscally

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:53.080
[Guest]: federal than the Indian Republic ever was or ever intended to be.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.600
[Guest]: So there is a really big difference in the constitutional setup of these two countries.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:05.260
[Guest]: So the states were always supposed to be responsible for all state and local issues, and the federal

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.060
[Guest]: government was only supposed to be responsible for defense and foreign affairs and so on.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.780
[Guest]: That's how the original United States Constitution was set up.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:18.740
[Guest]: Now every state, like the Indian system, is supposed to devolve power to urban local bodies.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:22.900
[Guest]: The difference is that that happened in America and it didn't happen in India.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:27.460
[Guest]: The second thing is, urban local bodies came as an afterthought in India.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.100
[Guest]: In America, it was the reverse.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.700
[Guest]: Immigrants went and settled in small clusters.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:39.060
[Guest]: Those clusters formed small local governments, and then those local governments became aligned

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:43.200
[Guest]: or got absorbed into some kind of a system within that state government.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:49.880
[Guest]: So the process was bottom up almost in the United States, at least in the initial period,

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:55.380
[Guest]: as opposed to India, where it was completely top down, where we disconnected what happened

00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:00.460
[Guest]: during the colonial times and said, we will reboot in 1950 with this new system.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:04.100
[Guest]: And the new system had no mention of urban local governments or rural local governments.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:08.140
[Amit Varma]: In fact, even now, the kind of reforms that you're saying you'd like to see are again

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:11.420
[Amit Varma]: fundamentally reforms that will come top down itself.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.700
[Amit Varma]: And that's sort of what worries me.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.660
[Amit Varma]: How realistic is it then to expect that given the incentives?

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.940
[Guest]: So there are two ways to think about this.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:24.700
[Guest]: Now, one way is we actually mandate that the revenue that is raised locally stays local.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.700
[Guest]: We change the rules.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.480
[Guest]: Yes, we change the rules of the game.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.580
[Guest]: We say that there are certain taxes which are reserved for local bodies.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.980
[Guest]: Those taxes can only be imposed locally, and the money will stay with the urban local government

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.900
[Guest]: or the rural local government.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.140
[Guest]: And that's one way to do it.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:43.940
[Guest]: Now, if you think about it, who votes on constitutional amendments, parliamentarians, right?

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.220
[Guest]: These kinds of constitutional amendments need to be ratified by half the number of states.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:52.900
[Guest]: So the other people who will vote on this is the state legislators.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.900
[Guest]: Both have no incentives of cutting off the branch.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.340
[Guest]: Yes, exactly.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:01.300
[Guest]: So it's almost like killing the goose that gives the golden egg, right?

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.940
[Amit Varma]: So the only hope really is that cities grow more and more populated and then the demand

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:05.940
[Guest]: side takes care of it.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.380
[Guest]: So that is the other way of thinking about it.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:12.620
[Guest]: So right now, I don't think there is any incentive among legislators to actually devolve more.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.060
[Guest]: Now there are a few things that can happen.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.740
[Guest]: Now even though institutions and rules of the game are really important, individuals

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.460
[Guest]: are also really important.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:25.980
[Guest]: I think it's a great move in India that the chief minister of a state after a very long

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:29.340
[Guest]: time became the prime minister of a country, right?

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:34.860
[Guest]: I think he had a vast experience as chief minister to really understand how we need

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.900
[Guest]: to be a more federal nation.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:43.260
[Guest]: Now whether Modi has made India more federal or not is debatable, but a lot of his rhetoric

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:48.180
[Guest]: talked about competitive federalism and, you know, devolving greater power to the states,

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.180
[Guest]: so on and so forth.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:53.100
[Guest]: And it must be said that during Modi's time, the finance commission's recommendations have

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:57.540
[Guest]: actually been taken and greater proportion of the central finances have been devolved

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.100
[Guest]: to the states, more so than ever before in any government.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:07.820
[Guest]: So there is some move made by some individuals who strongly believe in federalism and I don't

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.180
[Guest]: think we should underestimate that push because once a push goes in that direction, then,

00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:16.380
[Guest]: you know, it may continue to gain momentum and go in that direction, whether or not this

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.780
[Amit Varma]: government lives to see the day.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:21.420
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the default state of all systems in a sense is inertia.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.700
[Guest]: So any push can go a long way if it gathers momentum.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:25.700
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.060
[Guest]: And I think this push will continue further.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:34.260
[Guest]: So right now, I think Modi government devolved an additional 12 to 16%, I don't remember

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.280
[Guest]: the numbers off the top of my head, to the states than the governments before.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.880
[Guest]: And maybe that trend will continue and that would be great.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:48.380
[Guest]: So I would not underestimate a really strong and charismatic chief minister of any state

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:52.660
[Guest]: attempting to devolve greater funds to the local governments, right, to urban local and

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:57.580
[Guest]: rural local governments, especially urban local governments, because that's where a

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.860
[Guest]: vast majority of the population is going to be.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.540
[Guest]: But I don't see why any of this shouldn't apply to rural local governments.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.540
[Guest]: Their problems are different.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:10.380
[Guest]: They might need irrigation systems, and they might need better health care for women and

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.380
[Amit Varma]: so on.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.380
[Amit Varma]: That's what their problems are.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.380
[Amit Varma]: So they should be the ones to decide.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.380
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.980
[Guest]: So this applies for both urban and rural areas.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:24.020
[Guest]: So one is, I would not underestimate the importance of individuals in key positions who make such

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.020
[Guest]: a move.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.120
[Guest]: So that would be number one.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:32.780
[Guest]: The other is, I think eventually, when the urbanization process sort of starts to plateau,

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:38.380
[Guest]: and a large population already lives in urban areas, you have to eventually see that push

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.940
[Guest]: come bottom up, right?

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:45.820
[Guest]: The third way of thinking about this is, we've already privatized a lot of public goods services,

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:46.820
[Guest]: right?

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:51.660
[Guest]: A lot of, if you go to certain neighborhoods in Delhi, they get private water tankers,

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:54.460
[Guest]: rich and poor neighborhoods.

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:58.460
[Guest]: There are a lot of neighborhoods where garbage collection is now completely private, because

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.940
[Guest]: the municipal governments just stopped bothering to collect garbage.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.700
[Amit Varma]: And the citizens took their own.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.700
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:09.140
[Guest]: So when you dump garbage in the municipal dump, it's actually rack pickers who separate

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.180
[Guest]: the garbage also privately, right?

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.380
[Guest]: They do it so that they can collect the plastic and the recyclables and make money off of

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.380
[Guest]: it.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:23.020
[Guest]: So I would also not underestimate the importance of private enterprise to help solve a lot

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.300
[Guest]: of quasi public good issues.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.820
[Guest]: Now the trouble with this is you end up paying taxes.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:33.820
[Guest]: And then you again, end up paying the maintenance fee for a condo or for garbage collection

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.140
[Guest]: or whatever it is.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.980
[Guest]: And so far, Indians are doing it because these services are so incredibly important that

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:46.540
[Guest]: even the poorest of people end up paying money for, you know, better sewage systems or garbage

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.300
[Guest]: collection systems, even in slums.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.300
[Amit Varma]: They don't have a choice.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.300
[Guest]: I mean, I didn't have a choice.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:54.340
[Amit Varma]: I mean, just to just to put it harshly, the government is basically a parasite, if not

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.420
[Amit Varma]: a service provider.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.700
[Amit Varma]: So they have to get the service provided from elsewhere.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.700
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:04.060
[Guest]: And you see this in a lot of slums in Bombay and in other other big cities or other emerging

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:09.140
[Guest]: cities that there is a completely different political economy of slum governance, and

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:15.700
[Guest]: a lot of it is government and public, but a lot of it is also privately funded.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:20.580
[Guest]: And there is a local dada or you know, a slum leader who collects the money, right, and

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.700
[Guest]: actually ends up delivering the service.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.260
[Guest]: So this is already happening.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:29.740
[Guest]: The problem is when you pay twice as much tax, you lose a lot in productivity, right?

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:30.780
[Guest]: So that's a problem.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:36.180
[Guest]: The other is you have a lot of disgruntled citizens who feel like the state is oppressing

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.980
[Guest]: them and they are not getting their bang for the buck.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:40.500
[Amit Varma]: Correctly so, yeah, absolutely.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.420
[Amit Varma]: So let me try to sum up everything we've discussed so far.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:48.340
[Amit Varma]: The reason our cities are in such a bad state is because we need genuine fiscal federalism.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:53.900
[Amit Varma]: Even though we do have local governments in a nominal sense, those elected representatives

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:57.220
[Amit Varma]: can't really be held accountable because they don't have the power, the money comes from

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.220
[Amit Varma]: elsewhere.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:02.180
[Amit Varma]: And to fix fiscal federalism, you basically see three rays of hope.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:06.820
[Amit Varma]: One is enlightened individuals at the top who push these reforms through and make sure

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.700
[Amit Varma]: more and more money is devolved to the states.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:15.900
[Amit Varma]: Second is as more and more people move to cities, a bottom up demand side led movement

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.300
[Amit Varma]: for change.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:23.980
[Amit Varma]: And the third is private individuals just doing jogar and managing for themselves and

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:27.620
[Amit Varma]: essentially organizing themselves to do what the government has failed to provide them.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:28.620
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:32.180
[Guest]: So you can either reform government or you can make it irrelevant.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:36.060
[Guest]: So we don't know where the push will be, whether we will end up reforming government or making

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.380
[Guest]: it irrelevant.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.340
[Guest]: But it has to be one of those two choices.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:42.100
[Guest]: Otherwise, you will just see vast heaps of garbage everywhere.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:46.300
[Amit Varma]: Shruti, on that delightful note, thank you for coming on the show.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:39:14.180
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for having me.

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:39.820
[Amit Varma]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.980
[Unknown]: This is your captain speaking.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:45.820
[Unknown]: Sorry to say, but there's been a slight delay due to the apocalypse having suddenly begun.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:49.860
[Unknown]: As you can see, there's death, destruction and chaos taking place all around us.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.940
[Unknown]: But don't you worry, food and drinks will be served shortly.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:40:00.420
[Unknown]: And I would recommend checking out to get some of your favorite Indian podcasts.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.500
[Unknown]: We'll keep you going till this whole thing blows over.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:18.500
[Unknown]: Thank you.
