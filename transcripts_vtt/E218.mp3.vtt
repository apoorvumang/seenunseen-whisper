WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.760
[Amit Varma]: One of the many ways in which we don't keep up with the times is in adjusting our self-image.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.600
[Amit Varma]: My image of myself has always been that of a creator, though I would not have used that

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.560
[Amit Varma]: word creator when I was younger. I thought of myself as someone who would write books

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.040
[Amit Varma]: one day. When I fell in love with cinema as a kid, I thought I would make movies one day.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.940
[Amit Varma]: But then in my early teens, I chose between the two. I decided that writing books was

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.520
[Amit Varma]: easier as it didn't involve other people. But here's the thing, if I was born 30 years

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.840
[Amit Varma]: after I was actually born, these might not be the outlets I would aspire to. We are surrounded

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.100
[Amit Varma]: today by so many other ways to express ourselves, to tell stories, to connect with others. Maybe

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.560
[Amit Varma]: I'd want to be a YouTuber. Maybe I'd dream of being a showrunner for a web series. Maybe

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.480
[Amit Varma]: I'd want to be the Picasso of Instagram or the Shakespeare of stand-up comedy. And hey,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.160
[Amit Varma]: who knows, maybe I'd want to be a podcaster.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.360
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.440
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My guest today is Varun Duggirala, a creator and podcaster

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.880
[Amit Varma]: whose personal journey feels quite different from mine, partly because he's almost a decade

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.080
[Amit Varma]: younger, but who has recently been trying to figure out the exact things that I've been

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.240
[Amit Varma]: obsessing about. First, let me give you a bit of his bare bones bio. Varun did engineering,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.400
[Amit Varma]: then he did Maskom, then he worked for a while as a producer in MTV and Channel V. Then he

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.760
[Amit Varma]: started his own advertising agency, The Glitch, which was acquired a couple of years ago by

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.160
[Amit Varma]: the global giant WPP. He also runs a podcast called Advertising is Dead, and has a newsletter

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.960
[Amit Varma]: called Unschooled, as well as a YouTube show called The Varun Duggi Show, in which I was

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.360
[Amit Varma]: a recent guest. Now, what is a common obsession here? It's understanding how the world has

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.000
[Amit Varma]: changed for creators. You could say that by joining music television, Varun jumped in

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.520
[Amit Varma]: at the deep end at the end of the old world. And then when he stuck off on his own in 2009,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.240
[Amit Varma]: a new world was forming. Now, here are the salient points of this new world, which is

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.080
[Amit Varma]: still evolving. One, anyone can be a creator. You don't need fancy training and expensive

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.640
[Amit Varma]: equipment and the backing of a big platform to create stuff. A smartphone is enough. Two,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.200
[Amit Varma]: the relationship between creators and their audiences has gradually become more intimate

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.120
[Amit Varma]: with less need of a platform in between. And this has threatened advertising as well, which

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.720
[Amit Varma]: is a pertinent point given that Varun for more than a decade has been a creator working

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.320
[Amit Varma]: in the advertising business. And three, these new ways of how we connect with our audiences

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.840
[Amit Varma]: have changed not just the way we create, but also who we are. I've said time and again

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.920
[Amit Varma]: on the show that learning the art of long conversations changed who I am as a person.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.640
[Amit Varma]: In this episode, Varun echoes that sentiment. I enjoy chatting with him because I think

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.760
[Amit Varma]: like with most successful creators in this new world, what you see is what you get. Varun

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.560
[Amit Varma]: is straightforward, curious, humble about what he does not know, hungry to know more,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.000
[Amit Varma]: and always thinking about the world, getting meta, as it were. So I enjoyed this conversation

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.240
[Amit Varma]: that goes over many of these areas. But I have to warn you that it doesn't touch the

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.520
[Amit Varma]: emotional depths of the last couple of episodes I did with Gazala Wahab and Prem Panikkar.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.960
[Amit Varma]: This conversation won't make you cry, but it can make you think and what's not to like

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.480
[Amit Varma]: about that. Before we begin, though, let's take a quick commercial break, which because

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.920
[Amit Varma]: I don't actually have a sponsor for this episode is actually about my own writing course. Why

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.640
[Amit Varma]: don't you sign up?

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.320
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it? Well, I'd love

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.440
[Amit Varma]: to help you. One of the great joys of the lockdown for me was discovering how much I

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.600
[Amit Varma]: enjoy teaching what I've learned over the years. And my online course, The Art of Clear

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.160
[Amit Varma]: Writing is now open for registration. In this course, through four webinars spread over

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.760
[Amit Varma]: four weekends, I share all I know about the craft and practice of clear writing. There

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.400
[Amit Varma]: are many exercises, much interaction. And over the year that I've taught this course,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.520
[Amit Varma]: a lively writing community has formed itself. The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST, or

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.440
[Amit Varma]: about $150. And the April classes begin on April 3. So if you're interested, head on

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.720
[Amit Varma]: over to register at indiancut.com slash clear writing. That's indiancut.com slash clear

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.360
[Amit Varma]: writing. Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.520
[Amit Varma]: work hard and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills. I can help you.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.760
[Amit Varma]: Varun, welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.480
[Guest]: Thank you for having me. This is I'm really looking forward to this one.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, this is I have, of course, just been on your show, the Varun Duggi show, which

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.440
[Amit Varma]: was fun. And also, of course, you have your long running podcast advertising is dead.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.880
[Amit Varma]: And you know, when I was kind of researching for the show for this episode, I came across

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.800
[Amit Varma]: this quote by yours about how you don't do any prep, like you switch on 15 minutes before

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.780
[Amit Varma]: you're recording, and you switch off 10 minutes afterwards. And my process is somewhat different.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.320
[Amit Varma]: So I thought this is almost like, you know, Tendulkar and Ravid together in the popular

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.680
[Amit Varma]: stereotypes that it's effortless for one and so much effort for the other, though, obviously,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.040
[Amit Varma]: like I keep telling people about Tendulkar and Ravid that the stereotype is completely

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.480
[Amit Varma]: false, because Tendulkar also put in a heck of a lot of work and Ravid also had immense

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.620
[Amit Varma]: natural talent. So it's an unfortunate stereotype. But to come away from those particular superstars

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.320
[Amit Varma]: to you, tell me a little bit about your early years, like what is intriguing about you is

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.240
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, if one just sees the image of Varun Duggirala, co founder of The Glitch,

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.680
[Amit Varma]: content creator, productivity guru, all of those things, a podcaster, you get the image

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.160
[Amit Varma]: of a guy who's like, full on hipster type, you know, the would be at home in Bandra,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.940
[Amit Varma]: but you actually grew up in Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh. So tell me a little bit about that.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.720
[Amit Varma]: What was that like growing up in Kakinada?

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.880
[Guest]: So it's interesting you said Kakinada, right? So Kakinada was its original name. And then

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.280
[Guest]: it eventually became Kakinada when I was growing up. And I always thought it was cool to call

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.720
[Guest]: it Co-Canada. Even when you're young and you think okay, we're going to call it Co-Canada.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:32.240
[Guest]: But yeah, yeah. So interesting, right? I grew up in so Kakinada just for everyone is a coast

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:40.080
[Guest]: of Andhra Pradesh, East Godavari district. And a large part of families there. I mean,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.960
[Guest]: everyone grew up there. So standard, South Indian, Telugu, Brahmin family, everybody

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.000
[Guest]: is either a doctor or an engineer, the doctors stay back home, engineers go to America, literally

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.160
[Guest]: like the standard template is my family. So you will find a large part of my engineering

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:05.200
[Guest]: family in, in San Francisco, in Boston, you know, the regular spots as such. And my family

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.480
[Guest]: back home was a multi-specialty hospital. I didn't know you had to pay for medical treatment

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.280
[Guest]: as much as you did for the longest part because every specialization, there was some uncle,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.000
[Guest]: or there was somebody there, right? So that's how I grew up. I actually grew up in a hospital.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.960
[Guest]: My dad's a surgeon, my grandmom, even though she was, she practiced as a gynecologist,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.000
[Guest]: was an MBBS, but because she became a doctor when she did, she, she basically delivered

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.480
[Guest]: generations and families and stuff like that. So I grew up on the on the first floor of

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.320
[Guest]: a hospital, had walked into an operation theater from the youngest of ages with a mask and

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.760
[Guest]: a cap and watch operations, fainted in one of those and then I realized I will never

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:49.320
[Guest]: be a doctor because I just couldn't deal with it. And, but it was great. I mean, I think

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.640
[Guest]: I grew up at an interesting time there as well, because I think my parents were not

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:01.360
[Guest]: the traditional kinds. I grew up with my dad and mom listening to Pink Floyd and, and Andy

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:07.960
[Guest]: Purple and, and Michael Bolton on the other end of things. And, and, and they had me when

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.080
[Guest]: they were very young. They were in the early 20s when they had me. So we kind of grew up

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.160
[Guest]: together. Dad was still studying, mom was still also studying. And, and Kakinada is

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.200
[Guest]: a great place because I had a good set of friends at play, but I also had got my own

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.920
[Guest]: space and in hindsight, I mean, I think a lot of how my mind works still originates

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.640
[Guest]: from a lot of stuff I learned as a kid over there, but yeah, it feels like a different

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.640
[Amit Varma]: world.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And, and, you know, once in a, not even a one-liner and a half-liner, you sort of

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.120
[Amit Varma]: spoke about your Kakinada years as being full of Chiranjeevi and Michael Jackson. But one

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.400
[Amit Varma]: thing, you know, that I'm really kind of curious about, and that I ask all of my guests at

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.080
[Amit Varma]: different ages, whether they're in the 50s, 60s, 40s, like me or 30s or whatever is, and

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.960
[Amit Varma]: I feel it also gives me a great sense of what it was like to grow up at that time in India.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, tell me the years of your childhood and what kind of stuff were you consuming?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.400
[Amit Varma]: Like, how much did you get to read? What was the access to books like? What kind of music

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.360
[Amit Varma]: did you listen to? Like, I remember when I was growing up in the 80s and the 90s, it

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.320
[Amit Varma]: was all the, you know, the stereotypical music, like you named Pink Floyd, and there will

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.760
[Amit Varma]: be the Deep Purples and all of that. And you had to make an effort to look beyond that.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.560
[Amit Varma]: The world was not at your fingertips as it were. So what were your sort of early influences

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:29.320
[Amit Varma]: in terms of, you know, music, films, books? What was that like for you?

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:36.040
[Guest]: So I actually had a lot of access to both music and books growing up. Mom and Dad read

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.960
[Guest]: a lot, still do. So I had access to a wide spread of books, right? So, and they almost

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.360
[Guest]: like pushed me to read more, primarily because I felt it's a good thing to do. You're gonna

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.420
[Guest]: get to know more about the world if you read. And that's what I ended up doing. So on one

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.120
[Guest]: end, you would have your standard, you know, you'd have your Annette Bliton, and like,

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.480
[Guest]: keep pronouncing her last name wrong. Or on the other end, you also end up getting books,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:03.320
[Guest]: which so I was a huge, I have to admit this, I spent the first three years of my life watching

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.720
[Guest]: the same movie, which was Jungle Book. Because I would walk across the street, there would

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.760
[Guest]: be a video lending library, which was a thing. And they only had like this one tape for kids.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:20.480
[Guest]: Everything else was Telugu movies or a couple of stuff from abroad. I just picked this up

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.440
[Guest]: and just and they would like just keep it because I would go every day, watch it, return

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:31.020
[Guest]: it and then again, go back the next day. And they were just like a couple of houses away.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:37.880
[Guest]: So growing up, I actually was I say I'm a weird mixture of being very extroverted but

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.600
[Guest]: yet extremely a person with a need to kind of have time to himself. I was that as a kid,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.840
[Guest]: like I would go out and play but I wanted to come back into my room and and play with

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.480
[Guest]: my GI Joe's and play with a lot of Lego and growing up at that time, it was a lot about

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.800
[Guest]: playing with toys by myself. And a lot of friends across the street would do the standard

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.520
[Guest]: stuff. But it was an interesting time because, you know, I'd love music from the time I was

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.880
[Guest]: a kid. This is story my mother tells that I would dance to water splashing in the bathroom

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.080
[Guest]: and I was that kid I would go for breakdancing competitions from the time it was allowed

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:19.080
[Guest]: for me to go in terms of just an age limit. And you would go to an audio cassette shop

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:25.360
[Guest]: and all you would find was Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson and Madonna and a few others

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.840
[Guest]: or once in a while a Bruce Springsteen would pop in and that's pretty much what you had

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.640
[Guest]: available. And I watched a lot of the albums lecture and he was a huge influence at that

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.920
[Guest]: time for most of us. I think I saw his thriller version before I saw the actual thriller version

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:43.180
[Guest]: of Michael Jackson. So I grew up that way. But I feel it was it was an interesting mix

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:49.120
[Guest]: of things as my parents were people who were very exposed to the world outside. So you

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.320
[Guest]: know, at home, I would still have you'd have a Michael J. Fox movie playing on one end

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:59.440
[Guest]: or you'd have I remember there was a book. There was Khalil Gibran's book, which used

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.560
[Guest]: to be there or, you know, you'd find such varied things at home. And you wouldn't understand

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.760
[Guest]: when you suddenly left the house, you see a lot of people weren't necessarily into a

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.480
[Guest]: lot of that stuff. So my parents kind of balanced it. I think I learned to balance it as well.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.360
[Guest]: And eventually you same for my sister as well many years later. But it was an interesting

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.200
[Guest]: time and they had a group of friends who I grew up with. And so this is a close group

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:29.120
[Guest]: I kind of grew along with. So yeah, I actually got a lot of my music influences from my parents,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.160
[Guest]: what they would listen to, I would listen to they don't see there was a lot of Beatles

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.960
[Guest]: at home. There was a standard, you know, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, etc. My uncle, my mom's

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.120
[Guest]: younger brother actually became an interesting influence for me because I had moved towards

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.320
[Guest]: listening to a lot of pop and stuff like that. Like he came home and he saw I think he saw

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.760
[Guest]: me listening to Backstreet Boys. And he was like this, there is no way you're going down

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:58.000
[Guest]: this route and gave me a Marilyn Manson and a Nine Inch Nails CD. My life changed after

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.840
[Guest]: that. Mother was not happy because I used to play Doom at that point of time and listen

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.640
[Guest]: to Marilyn Manson. And at that point of time in America, a lot of the school shootings

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.400
[Guest]: had had happened to people who are listening to this and playing that game, right? So and

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.240
[Guest]: I was like, you know, I know you're worried about it. That's not what I'm going to do.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.160
[Guest]: And and so I feel a lot of and then my my journey with music's been interesting. It's

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.360
[Guest]: one of the things I obsessed over so much. I listened to so much music through every

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.660
[Guest]: single genre. So that was like a huge point, which is also kind of led me to being this

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:37.360
[Guest]: person obsessed with music television. Like I would only watch channel B and MTV in the

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:43.400
[Guest]: 90s. Before that, for people who remember it, every Saturday or Sunday, DD Metro would

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:49.520
[Guest]: have a compilation of music videos that would come. Top of the Pops, I think it was called

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.400
[Guest]: I don't remember the exact name. There was an interesting name to it. So I used to record

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:59.640
[Guest]: those on a tape and rewatch them. So Careless Whisper. I remember there were a bunch of

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.840
[Guest]: those videos at that point of time. Tracy Chapman. And I would say I used to love the

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.160
[Guest]: music video as an as a form. It was something which really appealed to me. And I always

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.720
[Guest]: the dream was that in life, I want to something with MTV in life. I didn't know what it was,

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:19.920
[Guest]: but I think that it originated there and eventually did happen years later. So one tick off the

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:25.400
[Guest]: box happened. But my influences are very varied in that sense. Like so I would be guilty boy

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.400
[Guest]: when you come out of the house, two buttons of the shirt kind of get loosened up, you

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.040
[Guest]: go hang with the boys, talk about Chiranjeevi, do all of that stuff. But when you're back

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:37.920
[Guest]: home, I can also get my own space to be myself. So it was an interesting time growing up.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.280
[Amit Varma]: In that period, what's your comfort food like not just in terms of food, but are there songs

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:48.160
[Amit Varma]: you keep going back to other movies you keep going back to books you reread?

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:54.960
[Guest]: So I'm actually a hardcore massy Bollywood buff. Tridev is still one of my all time favorite

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.520
[Guest]: movies. I still go back to it when I need to find something to watch. And that's up

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.400
[Guest]: top, etc. were obviously always there. But I think Tridev is something I don't know why

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:09.120
[Guest]: I keep going back to it. Mithun movies, Dance Dance, Disco Dancer, that kind of cinema somehow

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.160
[Guest]: appealed to me and it still does. There was something so interesting about it that characters

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.160
[Guest]: right and for me what I used to enjoy about those were not the main guys. You'd have the

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.000
[Guest]: two guys around Amrish Puri or you'd have you know, those other characters for me was

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.880
[Guest]: so amazing. I miss them in movies now. So I do a lot of that though I go back to that.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:34.480
[Guest]: Yeah, I still eat pickle with every single meal that I can. So pickle is my comfort food.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:40.160
[Guest]: I through the pandemic because my mom couldn't ship me some I eventually found someone who

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.800
[Guest]: can ship it off Amazon and I got it. So food wise, I'm pretty straightforward. I enjoy

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.160
[Guest]: all kinds of food but I am eating by myself. You still old school, right? You'd have some

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.000
[Guest]: pickle if you're if you're guilty. And but yeah, so I still go back to some of those

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.920
[Guest]: things. I've also got a lot into science fiction at that point of time as well. So Austin Scott

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:06.840
[Guest]: Card was a huge influence in terms of his books, not necessarily his political views

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:13.280
[Guest]: later on, but as I as I learned, but he wrote a series called the Ender series, which kind

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.240
[Guest]: of really stuck with me, right. And what I loved about that is he wrote a series with

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.880
[Guest]: one character, and then he went back and he wrote the same story from the perspective

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:26.320
[Guest]: of different characters, which I found so interesting for an author to actually do in

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.600
[Guest]: science fiction and fantasy. So yeah, so varied influences, varied directions, as you can

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.600
[Amit Varma]: see.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, fascinating. And you mentioned that your parents had you early, they were in their

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:40.520
[Amit Varma]: early 20s. And you know, just today in my writing group, someone shared one of my favorite

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.560
[Amit Varma]: poems by Philip Larkin, where the first verse effectively is, they F you up your mom and

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.120
[Amit Varma]: dad, they may not mean to, but they do, they fill you with the faults they had, and add

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.560
[Amit Varma]: some extra just for you. And then it kind of goes on. What were they like as parents?

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.720
[Amit Varma]: Were you a rebellious kid? What kind of kid were you? When you look back in hindsight,

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.800
[Amit Varma]: like now you're a parent yourself, and I'm presuming you became a parent a little later

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:07.080
[Amit Varma]: with a little more reflection and all of that. So what was it like growing up? Because in

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:11.120
[Amit Varma]: a sense, I think young parents when they have their first kid, they are growing up at the

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.200
[Amit Varma]: same time as a kid, which is, you know, kind of interesting and something that you might

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.660
[Amit Varma]: only see in hindsight. What was that like?

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.600
[Guest]: So I actually have a very interesting relationship with my parents, right? Because, like you

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:28.920
[Guest]: rightly said, we grew up together in many ways. They were learning things as at the

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.800
[Guest]: time when, you know, they were very young. But I think that what I had, in many ways

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.800
[Guest]: was we were very close knit unit, we were always together, we were doing stuff. I remember

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.800
[Guest]: when I did my kindergarten in Manipal, because my dad was doing his master's in surgery there.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.320
[Guest]: And I spent a large amount of time there because me and my mom would generally just like, roll

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.360
[Guest]: around and do stuff. I mean, I didn't have school. And you'd explore places, you kind

00:17:53.360 --> 00:18:01.000
[Guest]: of go somewhere and me and my mom on her on her. It was a Luna would kind of go around.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.320
[Guest]: And I think that's what made it interesting for for I think, for all three of us, because

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.300
[Guest]: we kind of got, you know, I feel like you have a lot more moments when you're not watching

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:16.840
[Guest]: something or not doing something. And I feel we had a lot more moments. Nowadays, obviously,

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.800
[Guest]: which is what I still try to do as a parent now, I still retain that a lot more. And,

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.240
[Guest]: and eventually, when you kind of got back, obviously, everybody gets into their work

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.640
[Guest]: and everything else. But I but for me, those early years were very interesting. And whichever

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:35.520
[Guest]: part I recollect, because I feel that, you know, they were trying to get to a point of

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:42.280
[Guest]: actually doing something in life, while I was still trying to figure out what I mean,

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.960
[Guest]: you're in kindergarten, you don't know anything, right. So and I was a reasonably naughty kid,

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:52.360
[Guest]: I would not be. So, you know, they'd be having breakfast and get a call from call from school

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.640
[Guest]: that I've cut my tongue by jumping around with my tongue out. So I had to get surgery

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.280
[Guest]: on my tongue to stitch it up. Because my tongue was flopping out and I just done something

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:07.240
[Guest]: in or like fallen off a Luna somewhere and some stones gone into my knee. So I was, I

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.800
[Guest]: don't think I was troublesome, but I would get into trouble a lot. I've always been good

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:17.400
[Guest]: at avoiding being caught. It has been the long standing trend to a large part of my

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:22.120
[Guest]: schooling years is that I would be involved in the planning of things. I would be involved

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:27.240
[Guest]: in the execution of a prank or something to do, but most times would not get caught. And

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:33.520
[Guest]: I kind of see that trait in layer as well. So I at some point, I call her out on some

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.920
[Guest]: of those things. I like I know what you're doing. I've done that. So for the three and

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.880
[Guest]: a half year old, three and a half year old, she looks at me. So fair enough, you got me

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:48.240
[Guest]: there. But I think that it's all it was great fun growing up with with them being so young

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.760
[Guest]: as well because I because I got to see parties as I was growing up, I got to see them being

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:59.040
[Guest]: young. So those are my oldest remembrance recollections of both of them, which which

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.040
[Guest]: is great.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.160
[Amit Varma]: That's fascinating. And what was it like growing up in a small town? Like how long were you

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:10.840
[Amit Varma]: there? And also I guess a small town can affect you in two ways. One is that it can give you

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.960
[Amit Varma]: a certain sense of confidence because back in the day, you don't really know the big

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.600
[Amit Varma]: bad world out there. So you know, you can be comfortable in your skin and all those

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.520
[Amit Varma]: other anxieties that might come in when you're in a big city when you feel you're being judged

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.080
[Amit Varma]: where all those other pressures aren't really there. But at the same time, what's your view

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.960
[Amit Varma]: of the world in the sense of view of the world, even given that, you know, you're in a home

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.600
[Amit Varma]: of some privilege, there's exposure to books and music and all of that, but even all of

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.880
[Amit Varma]: that is kind of limited. So what's your view of the world at that time? And when you look

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:46.480
[Amit Varma]: back on, you know, the small town, you, you know, what strikes you?

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.720
[Guest]: The interesting part is, there is an interesting flip, right? And you mentioned it in the right

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.320
[Guest]: way. When you're in a small town, and you do reasonably well at things, I was an I was

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.200
[Guest]: an average, sometimes above average student, right? I was not I was, you know, I was one

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.040
[Guest]: of those guys, you go to a PT meeting saying he can do he has so much potential, you know,

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:08.400
[Guest]: that kid, but I'd still be like house captain easily, I would win a swimming competition

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.000
[Guest]: because there were five kids who would swim. And so there was things where you in hindsight

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.560
[Guest]: to think about and you're like, so I would hustle my way into being every single sports

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:22.760
[Guest]: team very bad at sport in general. And so I don't think I was overconfident. But I did.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:26.200
[Guest]: I wasn't confident with a certain sense of confidence that you know, I was among the

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:31.960
[Guest]: top set of people, right? Not necessarily studies, because obviously, and you know,

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:38.200
[Guest]: there's a huge issue with education and systems in general, because I feel they're built for

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:44.040
[Guest]: almost like a supply chain system of getting people out with the same sort of mindsets.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.480
[Guest]: So I wasn't actually those guys would get like 95% 96%. And I ended up in my 10 standard

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:54.440
[Guest]: with like an 88%, which in hindsight is not bad. But it wasn't necessarily that you didn't

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.320
[Guest]: get above 90%. So a lot of people would be like that my parents didn't necessarily care

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:05.400
[Guest]: as much they were like, you know, 88 is good enough. And, and so but after that, when I

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.240
[Guest]: actually went to Bangalore, from 11th and 12th, and that actually was an interesting

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:16.120
[Guest]: story is that I actually joined junior college in in Kakinada. I took the standard or my

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.600
[Guest]: friends were joining a couple of those colleges to study to become engineers. I said, Okay,

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:25.880
[Guest]: I don't want to be a doctor. My logic was it takes x number of years to study to be

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:30.880
[Guest]: an engineer x number of years to be a doctor. Engineering is much lower. Let's do that.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.840
[Guest]: I also still love to code coding was a love of mine because I discovered computers and

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.040
[Guest]: I still remember that first dial up modem that came in trying to open that website at

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.960
[Guest]: night. Opening a website at night was for obvious reasons because you could also discover

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.720
[Guest]: things which are not allowed to watch when parents were awake. And so I was I was obsessed

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.960
[Guest]: with that. So I learned like, you know, early programming language like basic and, and c

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:59.520
[Guest]: plus plus and stuff like that. And, and I saw a lot of that. And I joined this college,

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.480
[Guest]: which is supposed to prepare you for engineering entrance and all that stuff. And the culture

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:10.240
[Guest]: shop we weirdly enough, even though I was in school in Kakinada was immense, because

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:17.680
[Guest]: it was a factory outlet to create people who would get into engineering college. And it

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.800
[Guest]: would almost be a scenario where you'd be in college from seven in the morning till

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:27.600
[Guest]: like seven at night, you are pushed to study Sanskrit as your language because Sanskrit

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:33.320
[Guest]: you can actually get almost 100 out of 100. Because all the questions come from the textbook.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:38.240
[Guest]: So it was almost you're mugging up the entire textbook. So you could actually get that you

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.600
[Guest]: need to get a higher percentile. And there's a reason why I feel that we have a factory

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:46.280
[Guest]: outlet of engineers coming because we're not necessarily bringing out creative engineers

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.960
[Guest]: that I really related to. I know everyone talks about three idiots. But when I saw that

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.420
[Guest]: and I and I saw, I think Chichori, right, which is a Sushant one, I related to those

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:01.400
[Guest]: more from those times, as much as it were engineering years, because that is the truth.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.840
[Guest]: That is what happens. And, and my uncle had come down to get a procedure done. One of

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.720
[Guest]: my dad's friends had come down to get a procedure done with my dad. And he's like, what are

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.040
[Guest]: you doing here? And I'm like, I'm doing this. It's like you, you are a person who should

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.000
[Guest]: not be here. And he said, let me take you to my school. And he was from a school called

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.920
[Guest]: Bishop Hortons in Bangalore, boarding school, been around for years and years and years

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.800
[Guest]: and some amount of heritage, etc. So it took me there somehow managed to get me so me my

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:32.560
[Guest]: dad and him drove down, sat there, dad, and he figured out how to get me admission. I

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.960
[Guest]: don't know what they did. They got me in. Because term had started been a few weeks.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:44.020
[Guest]: But he was an ex student and he kind of pulled a few pieces there. But once I got in and

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:49.200
[Guest]: I had to go to a hostel, very nice boarding school. The flip that happened in my life

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:55.040
[Guest]: is whatever I perceived as cool, whatever I perceived as a confidence building thing

00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:01.880
[Guest]: for me back in Kakinada suddenly became a big negative for me. Because you would watch

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.480
[Guest]: a movie, let's say I watch Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and this is a fact. And you find him wearing

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:11.480
[Guest]: a neon color t shirt, you would buy a neon color t shirt. I had that cool chain that

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:16.720
[Guest]: Shahrukh wore, right, which is not cool at all in hindsight to wear and I was told it

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:23.800
[Guest]: was not cool. So I believe those two years in boarding school, although I made some great

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.920
[Guest]: friends, some of them are still kind of chat with them on a, we all reunited on a WhatsApp

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:33.640
[Guest]: group recently, which is fun. I feel those couple of years really pushed me down in terms

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.440
[Guest]: of just generally what my confidence level was. So I retreated and I was this kid who

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.520
[Guest]: would get on the stage to do anything would do it. And I finally become this guy who was

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:46.480
[Guest]: very averse to, I wanted to prove that I was cool. So I would do stuff like bunking out

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.680
[Guest]: at night or go out and get biryani for the entire dorm because and not like I was paying

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:57.720
[Guest]: for it. I would be the guy who do those things just to almost get some sort of approval.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.320
[Guest]: And I feel a lot of people go through that. So years later, when I was asked to do my

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:08.560
[Guest]: first TEDx talk, and it was in the engineering college in Kakinada, what actually spoke about

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:13.360
[Guest]: was a small town mindset. And I spoke about that because I believe a lot of guys go through

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:18.800
[Guest]: that. A lot of people come from a small town with an immense chip on their shoulder, that

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:25.520
[Guest]: I'm somehow less aware, no lesser, I'm not where all these other guys are in everything,

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:30.180
[Guest]: apart from maybe marks. And I did that primarily because I felt that through my years in Bangalore,

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:34.000
[Guest]: my parents called those the dark ages of, of my time, I had a lot of fun. I have a lot

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.640
[Guest]: of friends from my Bangalore time, but it was not the nicest time in my own headspace

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.640
[Amit Varma]: in where I was.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:45.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And that's like a fascinating transition you spoke about, about how you sort of land

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:49.680
[Amit Varma]: up in Bishop's Cotton in Bangalore and all these other imperatives come into play where

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.400
[Amit Varma]: what was once cool is not cool. So you got to prove you're cool. And you're, you know,

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.280
[Amit Varma]: signaling in different ways. And that reminded me of something Jonathan Haidt recently said,

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.320
[Amit Varma]: like I produce a podcast called Brave New World, which is hosted by Vasanthar. And he

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:06.480
[Amit Varma]: did an episode with Jonathan Haidt, where he was talking about what social media has

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.200
[Amit Varma]: done over the last 10 years, essentially. And apparently, for boys, it's not been a

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.600
[Amit Varma]: problem because they spend a lot of time playing video games and all of that. And it builds

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.920
[Amit Varma]: up skills and it doesn't really hurt them. For girls, it's been devastating and has led

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:25.400
[Amit Varma]: to a rise in teenage depression and all of that. And I think what girls go through seems

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:30.240
[Amit Varma]: to be similar to what you said you went through in the sense that you are suddenly on this

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.320
[Amit Varma]: platform where everyone is performing all the time. You know, all the other nine year

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.440
[Amit Varma]: old girls, if you're a nine year old girl, are brand managers of themselves, where they're

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.080
[Amit Varma]: putting a particular face forward. And if you want to belong, that's what you do. And

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.480
[Amit Varma]: back in the day before social media, maybe you hang out in person together and you build

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.240
[Amit Varma]: bonds that way. But over here, everything is performative. There are all these anxieties

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:56.840
[Amit Varma]: and pressures and at a larger societal level, you know, it seems to me just sinking allowed

00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.040
[Amit Varma]: to be an analogue of what you went through when you, you know, went from a small town

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:05.240
[Amit Varma]: into the big bad world. And that seems to be happening to kids everywhere all the time.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, is that something that's kind of struck you as well?

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:16.920
[Guest]: Yeah, definitely has it because this need for acceptance is so high. And you're also

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.520
[Guest]: different kinds. And I feel that that says, I knew there were people in my batch, if I

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.240
[Guest]: go back to boarding school, who didn't necessarily care, you know, there would be one set of

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.520
[Guest]: people who were generally the guys who just came in to study, stay in the dorm, go do

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.320
[Guest]: what they want to do. Then there were the cool kids, right? There were some of them

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.960
[Guest]: who've been around boarding for a long time. Some of them who were good at sport, or, you

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.280
[Guest]: know, the guys who became became prefects or had, you know, all those things. I became

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.680
[Guest]: a prefect at some point, also stripped off it for a reason, which I'll get into. And

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.440
[Guest]: so they were all of those. And at some point, you want to be friends with the cool ones.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.440
[Guest]: And I mean, I don't think there's anything wrong about what you have your regular stuff

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.680
[Guest]: that happens. And it is a little bit of pulling of the leg and stuff. But I feel that for

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.480
[Guest]: some people who kind of stuck in between, which is what I was, I didn't want to be the

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.920
[Guest]: person who was not hanging around with with everyone. But I knew I wasn't cool enough,

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.920
[Guest]: because I didn't play football, my taste in music at that point, while I still had a few

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.440
[Guest]: of these Meryl Manson's and Nine Inch Nails and stuff like that, I was still also did

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.960
[Guest]: have a Backstreet Boys CD, because I still like to listen to Backstreet Boys. So, oh,

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.480
[Guest]: you don't listen to Guns and Roses happened, or you know, I discovered Weezer and I discovered

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.240
[Guest]: Green Day. And so people had progressed beyond some of the stuff I listened to, because I

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.840
[Guest]: didn't have access to them. And so that became a thing. And you slowly make friends. But

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.400
[Guest]: I feel that boarding school more than anything else, which I don't think it's it's going

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.880
[Guest]: to be the same now because of cell phones and everything else. Boarding school taught

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:46.480
[Guest]: you that you'd meet so many different characters from across the world. It's almost like a

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:53.920
[Guest]: mini social network where you kind of put into and you don't know what anyone's thinking,

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.120
[Guest]: because I don't think anyone's coming in with bad intentions. Everyone has their own thought

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.040
[Guest]: processes and you learn how to navigate life a lot more. And I learned a lot of that in

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.620
[Guest]: two years. And but in trying to do that, you would do stuff like you know, jump off the

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:11.440
[Guest]: gate and go and watch Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani of all movies and get caught, get stripped

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:17.840
[Guest]: off your prefect ship, kicked out of boarding, live in a friend's house, take money from

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.880
[Guest]: home and not necessarily spend it right and use it more for partying and other things

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:26.040
[Guest]: and not spend it on food. And I remember that there was a time when I told my mother and

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.540
[Guest]: she I knew that she was really upset about it, that I was spending change to eat bananas

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.920
[Guest]: as food, but spending all the money on going out to party and have a drink and all that

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:41.720
[Guest]: stuff, right. And in hindsight, really stupid things, but I feel doing stupid things in

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:48.080
[Guest]: life teach you later on. And, and I think I've learned a lot from from especially those

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.280
[Amit Varma]: years when I look back at those.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:55.200
[Amit Varma]: And it also kind of strikes me and I'm thinking aloud that in certain ways, you know, ambition

00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.160
[Amit Varma]: can be a drawback, in the sense that you spoke about kids in your boarding school who are

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.360
[Amit Varma]: not ambitious in a sense of needing to fit in. So they can just chill out, they can study,

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:08.440
[Amit Varma]: they can do whatever they can listen to Backstreet Boys. But if you're ambitious, and you want

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:13.400
[Amit Varma]: to get ahead in the world, and you want to fit in, then you start kind of doing things

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.960
[Amit Varma]: to fit in. And it can especially be a con and strikes me in the modern world where,

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, we grew up where our early thoughts are not captured for posterity, right? Because

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.480
[Amit Varma]: there's no Twitter, there's no Facebook, we are not the kind of garbage that we thought

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:30.280
[Amit Varma]: and said, like, I know, I thought and said, I'm sure you must have as well, because young

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:35.280
[Amit Varma]: people do, right? And it's not out there. Nobody's, you know, taking a screenshot, putting

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:39.880
[Amit Varma]: it out there. And with young people, it seems to me that there is this pressure to be performative

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:45.520
[Amit Varma]: to kind of enter that race. And once you have, it can harden who you are. Because I think

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.880
[Amit Varma]: what happens is that, you know, if I have a bunch of private thoughts, and I don't articulate

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:54.480
[Amit Varma]: them, it's that much more likely for me to change my mind to learn as things go on. But

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:59.560
[Amit Varma]: once I take public positions, then because of reasons of ego, I can feel compelled to

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.760
[Amit Varma]: double down and defend the positions I have taken. And then I can harden and that alone

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:09.720
[Amit Varma]: can just make me a completely different person from what I, you know, otherwise would have

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:14.120
[Amit Varma]: been. And again, I'm just thinking aloud. But do you think there's something to that?

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:19.600
[Amit Varma]: And you know, how much of sort of happenstance do you ascribe to your becoming the person

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.720
[Amit Varma]: you are? Because, you know, all these little things that happen in our lives can just shape

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.320
[Amit Varma]: us and take us in directions which changes completely. For example, what if you hadn't

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.520
[Amit Varma]: gone to Bishop Cotton School? What if you'd stayed in your engineering factory in Kokkinada?

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:37.480
[Amit Varma]: Or what if you know the directions that we'll discuss that you took after this, where you

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:42.560
[Amit Varma]: got into communication and all that and shifted from that path? What if all that hadn't sort

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.560
[Guest]: of happened?

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:51.600
[Guest]: I totally agree. I think that there are moments in your life which define who you become.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.680
[Guest]: One moment for me was definitely coming. And because also, it was weird that my parents

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:59.880
[Guest]: actually sent me because when I was in my fourth standard, they took me to another boarding

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.080
[Guest]: school in Ooty and I came back in three days. I literally went with my dad and came back

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:09.400
[Guest]: with my dad saying I don't want to do this. Basically cried and came back. But that would

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:16.040
[Guest]: be one strong moment. I feel another moment to be right after my 12th standard around

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:21.640
[Guest]: that time. Now here's where I think some things were just meant to be right. Everybody's supposed

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:28.520
[Guest]: to write for IIT. I don't think there's any chance I would have gotten into IIT. IIT pre-exams

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:34.680
[Guest]: were on 2nd of Jan 2000. Now for anybody, I'm just trying to think of the person who

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:41.840
[Guest]: decided that would be the day for an IIT exam to happen. It is the millennium. It is. It

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:49.360
[Guest]: is a day after New Year's Eve. And I knew so many people who were sitting and studying.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.680
[Guest]: I didn't. I didn't. I literally I didn't even give the exam. And I remember telling my parents

00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:00.960
[Guest]: I that I'm I'm going to but I just didn't. And that was I was anyway on a downward spiral

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.920
[Guest]: in life. And then that led me to not preparing properly for engineering intense exams. Didn't

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:11.880
[Guest]: get into it. Then you start escaping the reality that you are on a downward spiral. And I went

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:17.240
[Guest]: on that route for a long time. Because what happens is that you start. I feel the difference

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:23.120
[Guest]: is that at that point in time, you would hide stuff for fear of what your parents or what

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:27.480
[Guest]: society would think. But you would hide lesser things. So a lot of stuff you would do was

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:33.320
[Guest]: not entirely documented online, like you said. But I think the realm of what all you hide

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:38.480
[Guest]: like, I know that sometimes I kind of go back to some old posts on Instagram or on Facebook

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.200
[Guest]: and think, okay, was there stuff I would see in the past because I didn't know it was kosher

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:49.680
[Guest]: or not. And I agree. There were terms we use, there were jokes we made, there was gentle

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.320
[Guest]: behavior trends, because I don't think people I think there are two kinds, you either don't

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:57.520
[Guest]: know any better because everybody else is doing it. Or you know it and you willfully

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:04.040
[Guest]: do it. And I feel a vast majority, even maybe even now, don't know any better. They don't

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:10.160
[Guest]: understand the concept of many other things and why something is wrong. And I feel that

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.280
[Guest]: was obviously much larger than, but it's not like it's gone away even now. I still meet

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:19.000
[Guest]: many people who don't understand. I remember meeting someone in Bombay when, when the MeToo

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.680
[Guest]: movement was happening and he was like, does MeToo exist? Because I don't think he, I think

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.240
[Guest]: he was oblivious of it. I don't think he really meant it as to say, okay, do these things

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.960
[Guest]: really happen? I think he really meant it in terms of, is it actually such a big thing

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.840
[Guest]: that you know, it hasn't, you know, more than disbelief, it was more like, really, is it

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:46.920
[Guest]: such a big thing? So, and I found that interesting. And I take those parallels back in life through

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:54.400
[Guest]: many things, right? And, and, and you would look at even something as small as what it

00:35:54.400 --> 00:36:01.000
[Guest]: meant to kind of get into a place on merit, which I never knew. I'd gotten into bishops

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.040
[Guest]: through my uncle. I eventually got into engineering college again, through another dad's friend,

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:12.160
[Guest]: because management quota had to happen. So he figured a college, which was good in Bangalore

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.960
[Guest]: management quota, dad upset to pay money, got in. And that was again, one more downward

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.320
[Guest]: spiral in life, right? Didn't do well, kept flunking papers, managed to escape through

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:26.440
[Guest]: a four-year degree in six years. But, but yeah, so I feel that that period, I look back

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:31.840
[Guest]: at a lot, many times, sometimes, especially when I write something down, whenever I try

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:37.000
[Guest]: to write a book, I always go back to those years. Because I feel like in hindsight, I

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.400
[Guest]: learned so much from those years than I did at that point of time.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.280
[Amit Varma]: And you know, in one of the earlier episodes of advertising is dead, in fact, the most

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.680
[Amit Varma]: charming episode in my little opinion, you know, the Valentine's episode where your wife

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:53.800
[Amit Varma]: sort of chats with you, Pooja. And at one point, she, I think, uses phrase about you,

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.640
[Amit Varma]: which I found fascinating, which is she said that you're in a quote, deep relationship

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:04.120
[Amit Varma]: with yourself, stop quote. And I was kind of struck by that. And, you know, I've been

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.360
[Amit Varma]: sort of thinking about how we construct our sense of the self in recent years. And it

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:13.480
[Amit Varma]: strikes me that it is all so contingent in the sense that we are hardwired in a certain

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.240
[Amit Varma]: way. And that's an accident. And then we are born where we are in the circumstances and

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.940
[Amit Varma]: families. And that's also an accident. And then we go through life and all these different

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:27.800
[Amit Varma]: accidents happen to us. And in the end, we end up as you know, whoever we are at that

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:33.880
[Amit Varma]: point in time, which is to me, it seems almost entirely a product of accidents. And, you

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.960
[Amit Varma]: know, for someone given to this, you know, the kind of self reflection you've done in

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.200
[Amit Varma]: your podcast and in your newsletter and all of that, what do you think of that? Like,

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:46.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, do you think that if there is like, who is Varun really? Like, you know, it's

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:51.000
[Amit Varma]: easy to say that, okay, we are a product of all these different things happening to us.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.900
[Amit Varma]: But let's say that other things happen. Is there a constant Varun who is at the center

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:59.880
[Amit Varma]: of it all through this or do circumstances changing change you? Does a chemical imbalance

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:04.440
[Amit Varma]: in your head which you know, a different set of things happen? Does that change you? You

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.360
[Amit Varma]: know, there are people who will get a brain tumor and they'll go and do mass shootings

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:13.880
[Amit Varma]: because something has changed in a subtle way. So is there a core Varun in there? Or,

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:17.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, like me, do you also sometimes feel that you're kind of floating that you know,

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:23.720
[Guest]: who am I sort of? The floating happens all the time. But there is something I've realized,

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:30.920
[Guest]: especially in a weird way. After I started the podcast, right? I've always tried to play

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:36.160
[Guest]: the role which I felt I needed to post my Bangalore years because you know, I went through

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.880
[Guest]: the engineering phase didn't get didn't even apply for a job in engineering because I didn't

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:45.660
[Guest]: want to do it did that whole, did a call center stint where I worked for AOL cancellations

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:50.880
[Guest]: for about I think it feels like a year but I think it was four to six months and work

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:56.720
[Guest]: for Jack Daniels whiskey and a few others as a alcohol promoter. When I went to Pune,

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:03.160
[Guest]: I took a call for myself because and I feel that's which adds back to everything which

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:08.520
[Guest]: I am at this moment is that when I got into symbiosis in Pune, I'd actually gotten through

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.360
[Guest]: merit and I got into merit also through a bit of a fluke. So that's one more crucial

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:19.080
[Guest]: point in my life is my mother's was I don't know if she still is, but I should ask her

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:24.280
[Guest]: was a reader's digest reader for the longest subscriber. I'd always have that at home and

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:30.840
[Guest]: my mom would always be reading it. The symbiosis entrance piece application from came in a

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:35.560
[Guest]: reader's edition, sends it to me in Bangalore while I was working in the call center said

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:40.040
[Guest]: you always want to work in the media. Why don't you just apply and because I was doing

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.400
[Guest]: the job of a promoter as well. I'd applied to it saying I want to study PR was about

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:49.800
[Guest]: the same thing. I didn't know any better quit my job went back home didn't study just like

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:54.840
[Guest]: lied around on the couch and watched MTV for those few months. And then when I went back

00:39:54.840 --> 00:40:00.120
[Guest]: to Bangalore, give that exam. I actually I remember I went back to Bangalore got a haircut

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:06.740
[Guest]: met a friend after a long time had drank all night and and went for the exam in the morning

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:12.040
[Guest]: answered English answered general knowledge and walked out didn't answer start didn't

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:16.560
[Guest]: answer math none of those things because in my head I was like if it's for mass comm

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:21.640
[Guest]: why do they need these sections it was common for a lot of you know this is a random point

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.000
[Guest]: I don't I was still not serious in life but I still had a job and I was still figuring

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.600
[Guest]: it out. So and I got in I got in the first list I remember when I got in the first list

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:35.920
[Guest]: I didn't believe it I didn't even check someone checked and called me and I cut the call because

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:42.440
[Guest]: I was asleep at two in the afternoon and and I think at that point I'm like this is finally

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.680
[Guest]: you're getting a chance in life to prove something through merit something you always wanted

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:53.480
[Guest]: to do. So when I went to Pune I said it's not like I will suddenly become this saint.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:58.600
[Guest]: But if I don't focus now, there is no point. And so I became this person who knew I had

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.440
[Guest]: a role to play and my role was okay during this time I need to learn as much as I can

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.880
[Guest]: about this space that I've always been so fascinated by that I can get a career here.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:12.200
[Guest]: Where do you want to work channel be MTV literally two places I wanted to work went to internet

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:17.480
[Guest]: MTV did all of that through my reality show period focused on being a producer. That's

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:22.360
[Guest]: what I wanted to be through the period of glitch. It was about being the right kind

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.920
[Guest]: of I don't think entrepreneur but just being that person who was around to make sure enough

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:33.680
[Guest]: support was there. The podcast actually let me suddenly be myself again after a long time

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:39.240
[Guest]: out in the open, which I never was I'd still hold back that I was a guy even at least would

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:44.720
[Guest]: not go out and have a lot of like events kind of going out for a drink. I would not go beyond

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.720
[Guest]: the first drink and I would leave because I'm like I will not I still have to have that

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.440
[Guest]: relationship where you can turn to me when you need something. Not someone who's always

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:57.920
[Guest]: hanging out even though I might want to some of the early guys was who I crossed that with

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:03.840
[Guest]: very early on and but with the podcast I realized that now I'm so open about I'm like an open

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.400
[Guest]: book I talk about everything in my life people like why you so open about things I'm like

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:11.960
[Guest]: I finally have come to a point in life where I'm like all the stuff I've been interested

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:17.600
[Guest]: in all the stuff I have I like to do even though it some of them might be really weird.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:24.120
[Guest]: It's fine. That's what makes me who I am. And the more I speak about it with that tone.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:30.920
[Guest]: If there is a young kid from another small town listening to me in a small way, and I

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:35.480
[Guest]: feel like I want to give back to that kid that I was who was a lot of fun when he was

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:41.320
[Guest]: growing up in Kakinada had a lot of confidence of all the stuff that he was interested in.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:45.680
[Guest]: Like I was a kid would jump off a stool for a breakdancing competition and jump onto stage

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.280
[Guest]: and try and do a Prabhudeva move. Right. And I went from that to being a person who was

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:57.440
[Guest]: just very happy to be at the back and not really be in the forefront of things and and

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:04.200
[Guest]: so I agree that what we are as kids is the purest form of what we are. But I feel at

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.740
[Guest]: some point when you when you reach a certain point in life to kind of go back to that if

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:13.280
[Guest]: you're lucky and get to have a slightly more mature version of that kid.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:18.960
[Amit Varma]: It's kind of fascinating and I like last week I did an episode with Prem Panikkar and who

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:24.760
[Amit Varma]: you know had a turbulent childhood turbulent sort of early adulthood and you know nothing

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:29.840
[Amit Varma]: was working out for him and then at one point he says that he finally got a job in Bombay

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:35.200
[Amit Varma]: in the Free Press Journal and he went out there and when he was given the job he was

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:40.360
[Amit Varma]: shown his desk and said okay this is where you'll be sitting and he said that was a turning

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:45.600
[Amit Varma]: point in his life because he sits down and then he goes to the loo and he throws up because

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:50.280
[Amit Varma]: he realizes that you know for the first time in his life that you know everything that

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:54.940
[Amit Varma]: he's ever spoken about he can do it now. Now is the time for him to actually act and get

00:43:54.940 --> 00:44:00.420
[Amit Varma]: stuff done and you know when you were sort of speaking about that shift to symbiosis

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.600
[Amit Varma]: like earlier in your episode with Pooja you spoke about how you were always blaming others

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:10.440
[Amit Varma]: for everything that went wrong you know including those unfortunate choices of school or engineering

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:15.400
[Amit Varma]: or whatever and now you couldn't blame yourself anymore you had to kind of take charge and

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:20.000
[Amit Varma]: another thing that struck me about that episode was how you know your wife mentioned that

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.160
[Amit Varma]: your symbiosis friends remember you very differently from your Bangalore friends you know they

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:31.160
[Amit Varma]: remember you as much more driven and focused and all of that. Now when you came into it

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.920
[Amit Varma]: obviously like you said you weren't even sure what PR was early on you shifted into you

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:40.760
[Amit Varma]: know video production I think you said. What was that formative period like because you

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:46.120
[Amit Varma]: are discovering the media now it's also the early 2000s where the media is kind of changing

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.360
[Amit Varma]: shape and just becoming a whole different demon like I think when you know when I was

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:55.240
[Amit Varma]: on your show we spoke about how I was an MTV and Channel V from 95 to 99 and you made the

00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:01.080
[Amit Varma]: same journey 10 years later and yet it struck me later that the organizations that we worked

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:05.480
[Amit Varma]: in at that time were completely different from each other and indeed they are completely

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:11.120
[Amit Varma]: different now from when you left it. So everything is evolving everything is changing and you

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.800
[Amit Varma]: are in this place where I presume some of the teaching must be teaching about an old

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.240
[Amit Varma]: paradigm an old world which is actual so you know a lot of it is just not going to be relevant

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.440
[Amit Varma]: you have to figure stuff out so take me through your process of kind of you know discovering

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:32.000
[Amit Varma]: what is the kind of work that you want to do and you know and how your image of yourself

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.240
[Amit Varma]: therefore evolves like at that point in time what do you see yourself becoming. So if I

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:44.040
[Guest]: look at my symbiosis time it wasn't as much about what I was taught to be honest I still

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:50.680
[Guest]: wasn't focused in studies that I would still like if you had a 8 a.m. and 3d animation

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:55.820
[Guest]: class I would not show up because I would not be awake at 8 a.m. but there were few

00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:01.120
[Guest]: modules that really spoke to me and interesting enough so I remember my editing teacher right

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.640
[Guest]: he would show us Amar Akbar Anthony and he would talk to us about certain shorts and

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:11.960
[Guest]: how they were edited and he was this fascinating man and Yogesh Mathur I think his name was

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:17.040
[Guest]: and he'd come in from FTI and he would talk about these things and I was never so I'm

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:22.000
[Guest]: not a purist in that sense I won't talk about film the way people do and digital versus

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.720
[Guest]: film and none of those things right I'm a product of the 90s MTV I keep going back to

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:33.520
[Guest]: that for me having being able to have worked with Chinnappa and Cyrus and all these guys

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.800
[Guest]: was like a dream because I'd kind of for me the benchmark of someone who was really held

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.440
[Guest]: that spot for me has been Nikhil Chinnappa right by far like the range that man is shown

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:48.360
[Guest]: still continues to show in fact he's still there still relevant is phenomenal and I look

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:53.800
[Guest]: and so when I was there I think I made a great set of friends and we all interestingly had

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:58.440
[Guest]: similar interests deep down I feel a lot of my friends I still have from Bangalore great

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:03.200
[Guest]: guys I can hang with them we'll have a lot of fun but I think deep down what we were

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.680
[Guest]: really interested in what we could talk about for days and hours was not necessarily the

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:13.540
[Guest]: same thing and I think that's really the big difference and secondly when you're in a communication

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:19.160
[Guest]: school no matter how much structure they might want to put around you it still is a lot more

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:24.880
[Guest]: open-ended you'd have an art class and you would have a class around editing and and

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:30.760
[Guest]: I was terrible at cameras I will not say camera and a bunch of those and and I feel that gave

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.560
[Guest]: me a certain level of freedom and also because we all were living off campus Pune was an

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:39.800
[Guest]: interesting space at that point of time for us because we weren't in the huge campus that

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:44.840
[Guest]: the Simbi kids are now and right we were in this small campus and we had like four rooms

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:49.600
[Guest]: and we all live around campus somewhere so I feel that period for me was great because

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:54.560
[Guest]: of the friends I made and because of the conversations I had with some of my professors some of them

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:59.040
[Guest]: who were from an old time right so when I went to intern and came back me and Rohit

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:05.160
[Guest]: had you know my co-founder we'd used cameras like it was something we would we could rough

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:10.240
[Guest]: rough around with but back in college for a lot of those professors a camera was I remember

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:15.720
[Guest]: professor said camera tumhari maa hoti hai roti usse milta hai is the actual thing that

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.400
[Guest]: was said right because we were even playing around with the camera I said why can't I

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.720
[Guest]: just throw it off a thing I'll pad it up so I can get that drop down shot of something

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:28.840
[Guest]: falling and I saw the shock on on my professor's face that I would even think of something

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:34.360
[Guest]: like that but I'm like it's okay it's a handicap and we'll throw it off when he like really

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:41.520
[Guest]: had a bit of a fit I remember but more than anything else I feel you need to be around

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.480
[Guest]: the right set of people at the right time in life I feel at every single point like

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:50.480
[Guest]: I would not have been as reasonably fluent in Hindi if it was not for my friends during

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:55.400
[Guest]: engineering college who were all Punjabi I learned Hindi from them because till then

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:59.640
[Guest]: school Hindi is not Hindi you do not say hai at the end of every sentence I have never

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.000
[Guest]: understood why that is written that way I learned it from a group of Punjabi boys almost

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.800
[Guest]: all of whose weddings I've danced at and and who I meet whenever I can when they're here

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:14.760
[Guest]: or whenever I've been able to travel and what is fun about the bunch who I met in simpies

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:18.040
[Guest]: those are guys I still hang with even now they are still my closest friends they're

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:26.640
[Guest]: still the people I can truly be no holds barred hang the same baby I've hung since 2005-06

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:31.040
[Amit Varma]: I think and what was sort of you know during this period where you're learning the craft

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:35.320
[Amit Varma]: of different things whether it's editing and you said not so much camera but you're learning

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:39.480
[Amit Varma]: the craft of different things what is the kind of art that appeals to you like what

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.960
[Amit Varma]: are your influences who are your idols like of course you've said that there's an attraction

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:48.000
[Amit Varma]: towards MTV and channel V though by this time they had actually changed a lot because I

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.640
[Amit Varma]: remember you know when I went to channel V shortly after quick gun morugan happened and

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:55.700
[Amit Varma]: all of that because I was sort of attracted to that I was there for a couple of years

00:49:55.700 --> 00:50:01.040
[Amit Varma]: and I went to MTV and you know your ex-boss Cyrus Oshidar joined a bit after that who

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:05.640
[Amit Varma]: you've you know mentioned in other conversations and I still remember there was one drastic

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:11.080
[Amit Varma]: day where you know at that point in time ours early CEO before Alex came in was a guy called

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:16.520
[Amit Varma]: Sunil Lulla who I remember when he first interviewed me he was wearing shorts and green socks which

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:20.560
[Amit Varma]: I thought is so cool this is what MTV should be and he would always say that we will only

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:24.240
[Amit Varma]: play western music we are not going to do Hindi we're not going to do this and then

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:29.440
[Amit Varma]: there was this regional meeting one day where you know there was I think whoever was charge

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:35.080
[Amit Varma]: of MTV Asia came down and he's like standing in the middle and the entire office is there

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.800
[Amit Varma]: and that guy stands there and you know reels of the figures that this is how much Bollywood

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:44.720
[Amit Varma]: sells this is how much Hindi sells I don't understand why we are not playing that music

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:49.080
[Amit Varma]: and Sunil is of course nodding vigorously and we went Hindi with a vengeance and that

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:55.720
[Amit Varma]: was a first shift I saw and it was still okay and I came in from this very sort of snobbish

00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:01.200
[Amit Varma]: and elitist position of no no you know I came here because you know I love alternative rock

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:07.080
[Amit Varma]: and you know I'd be talking about all those great shows in the MTV US and you know I was

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:10.680
[Amit Varma]: devastated when they dropped Beavis and Butthead you know when I joined MTV it was playing

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:15.640
[Amit Varma]: and they dropped it and and I thought that's a horrible shift but then what I saw in the

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:21.080
[Amit Varma]: 2000s was that the shift was you know they just went into reality TV and roadies and

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:25.620
[Amit Varma]: all of that which you know not my thing at all and then they went I mean it just seems

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:30.560
[Amit Varma]: to me that they progressively went further and further away from what I like them for

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:34.840
[Amit Varma]: in the first place but that's a digression what I was asking was what were you looking

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:38.600
[Amit Varma]: up to then like you're learning the craft what kind of work do you want to do like do

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:42.600
[Amit Varma]: you want to make movies at some point you want to make music videos at some point what

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:47.760
[Amit Varma]: are the music videos that you really like from that period so weirdly enough I wanted

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.360
[Guest]: to just make music videos I thought that's what people in music channels did that we

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:56.040
[Guest]: would make music videos you in hindsight you find out that's not true at all so I went

00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:01.120
[Guest]: through phases I think for me some of the typical ones that you would listen to Nirvana

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:06.040
[Guest]: very into Kurt Cobain and Jim Morrison so when he said how was I in college I at some

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:11.960
[Guest]: point became that pretentious okay and now I'm in a communication school person it's

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.960
[Guest]: okay in college we're all pretentious so I think that's that's not necessarily a negative

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:21.760
[Guest]: point so I had grown my hair out a little bit I would have a jola on the side I would

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.560
[Guest]: I would listen to Jim Morrison at night after having had a couple of extra drinks shoot

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:32.120
[Guest]: my own shadow in the dark with some light on it and edit something weird with my own

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:37.520
[Guest]: poetry which is horrendous because and it wasn't like I was not warned I remember telling

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:42.800
[Guest]: me that I was influenced by the world's worst poet was Jim Morrison because I used to read

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:48.240
[Guest]: Jim Morrison's poetry books and try to write poetry like him not the best frame of reference

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:53.040
[Guest]: in hindsight but that was my frame of reference and that is my influence so I would write

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:58.840
[Guest]: these poems and I would dance in this thing and I would show it in college to some professors

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:02.440
[Guest]: who were also a little warped and they would try to find meaning in what I was shooting

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:10.400
[Guest]: and I was just a drunk guy who should be shadow and and it was a lot of fun I enjoy so I remember

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:15.720
[Guest]: that I submitted a lot of music videos as projects during that time except for my final

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:20.280
[Guest]: project and love shooting that kind of stuff because anything was orbit I would try stuff

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:25.680
[Guest]: out like but I also realized that I was always bit of a I think a Jew guard is the right

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.600
[Guest]: word so you would end up shooting a lot of stuff and you realize you don't have enough

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:32.840
[Guest]: footage so you suddenly start reversing the footage to cover up for it and make that seem

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:38.760
[Guest]: cool so I do a lot of those I should love to edit to edit was the edit room or something

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:42.360
[Guest]: which I fell in love with very early on because I could well that's where stuff really gets

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:47.440
[Guest]: made I actually went to MTV at an interesting time as well at my internship I remember was

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:52.560
[Guest]: in MTV and I said okay I'm going here I managed to get into the place I've always wanted to

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:57.760
[Guest]: get into and that office was phenomenal it's that huge space they had the vibe of it it

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:02.520
[Guest]: was just more than I ever expected it to be I remember we walk in the first day and you

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:08.520
[Guest]: see brocha sitting there and brocha's doing what brocha does in life which is just generally

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:14.680
[Guest]: being he was being a he wasn't an element of being a prankster in those days so he was

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:18.560
[Guest]: doing that because you'd pull off buckra's on every new person who joined MTV at that

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:24.440
[Guest]: point of time and he was pulling that off on someone so I happened to notice it and

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:28.440
[Guest]: one of my first shoots was with Nick Hill so all that is happening right I did research

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:32.800
[Guest]: for roadies but my thing was that okay I'm gone here let me learn as much as I can so

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:37.160
[Guest]: I worked on every single show that was possible so that influenced me a lot because I learned

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:42.960
[Guest]: the I learned the art of formats at MTV I actually learned how stuff has to be short

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:49.160
[Guest]: how you can because we were doing a lot with very little and we were using time like nobody

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:53.400
[Guest]: else was and I realized that only MTV did that channel we never did that because when

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:57.920
[Guest]: I later on went to channel B how much ever time it would take me to do three edits would

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.520
[Guest]: take someone people would do just one in that because MTV had taught me to work a certain

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:07.600
[Guest]: way that taught me a certain work ethic and and almost a structure of working which just

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:13.480
[Guest]: I feel that whatever we have as internet culture now is still for me stuff we did in MTV and

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:18.040
[Guest]: channel B right I can take every single format there is a connection there and I feel and

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:23.240
[Guest]: I'm a huge format junkie I love to explore different formats of just not everything like

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:28.480
[Guest]: even how people write a newsletter to how someone makes a YouTube video to to an Instagram

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:32.960
[Guest]: reel I look at formats like a hawk it's one of those things I love to see because I think

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:39.080
[Guest]: it shows variation and gives you something to kind of use as a framework and I kind of

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:43.000
[Guest]: brought that back so after my first year when I first year was generally chill I was learning

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.440
[Guest]: the ropes and stuff but I feel I came back to college in my second year after that three

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:52.640
[Guest]: four months stint at MTV having learned so much in that period and that's when I was

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:58.400
[Guest]: clear about what I wanted to do I knew I could be someone who worked in that kind of television

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:05.480
[Guest]: like youth television and reality TV was weirdly enough something I really enjoyed I gravitated

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:09.520
[Guest]: towards it because and I think at that time reality was a little different than what it

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:14.160
[Guest]: became eventually which is when I kind of tuned out of television reality then was saying

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:22.040
[Guest]: can you take a set of people and put them in a situation that will make them react with

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:26.200
[Guest]: some sort of emotion right so in my head is actually if you go deep into it's almost like

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:30.560
[Guest]: you're looking at human psychology right what will make someone because you are under pressure

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:36.000
[Guest]: you have cameras on you and you need to find a way to kind of push someone a little over

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.740
[Guest]: that edge to be able to react in the way they would naturally would if they were under pressure

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:44.440
[Guest]: but you just have to bring that in faster so and we would sit and do those things I

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.760
[Guest]: remember the first time I made someone cry on camera I felt I was really upset and I

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.640
[Guest]: would sit and I was and I remember Raghu came up to me and he sat down with me because he

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:55.160
[Guest]: saw I was upset about it and and he kind of sat with me and he spoke to me about the mindset

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:58.360
[Guest]: you need to have and the fact that you're not forcing someone to do this they've signed

00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:04.240
[Guest]: up to be on a show you're doing what you have to do you're not in any way causing them harm

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:09.120
[Guest]: this is the pressure of it and and so I had a bunch of really good mentors at that point

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:13.160
[Guest]: I mean there were a bunch of producers the entire roadies bunch I remember Nikhil was

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:18.560
[Guest]: a person I would turn to I still turn to sometimes uh what speak to about how he did all the

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:24.840
[Guest]: stuff he did and I feel for me those four months and the stint I had after that when

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:30.320
[Guest]: I went back to MTV that was my true university in everything I've done in my career how to

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:35.080
[Guest]: manage teams how to organize stuff logistics I've learned it in that year and a half and

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:40.160
[Amit Varma]: you know a lot of things to kind of unpack there firstly you know I love reality television

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:43.760
[Amit Varma]: as well but as you know one of the early years of Twitter I think I was live tweeting Big

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:48.640
[Amit Varma]: Boss which I kind of liked much more than roadies to be frank which I thought was you

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:54.160
[Amit Varma]: know kind of obnoxious and difficult to watch but that's just me but one of the things that

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:58.040
[Amit Varma]: struck me when you were talking about your early forays into Jim Morrison's poetry and

00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:02.800
[Amit Varma]: all of that is that typically when we are young and especially when we try to create

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:07.840
[Amit Varma]: things and of course it is a fact that in men the prefrontal cortex which is responsible

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:13.800
[Amit Varma]: for socializing and all that doesn't really you know develop till 25 so which is why a

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:18.520
[Amit Varma]: lot of teenage violence and all that is kind of common so so people take time to get formed

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:23.560
[Amit Varma]: and when you're young often you have energy but you don't necessarily have either taste

00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:29.160
[Amit Varma]: or experience and experience of course comes with time and taste also forms and I think

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:32.800
[Amit Varma]: part of taste forming is of course you want to fit in with your peers so you listen to

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:37.200
[Amit Varma]: whatever they're doing but through all that there is kind of a core of your own taste

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:41.960
[Amit Varma]: to your own aesthetic your own sensibility kind of forming so you know couple of things

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:47.960
[Amit Varma]: like one clearly from a lot of your work like your newsletter especially recently focuses

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:52.080
[Amit Varma]: on things like frameworks and processes and all of that as you mentioned and that's a

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:57.240
[Amit Varma]: craft of it and that's also incredibly fascinating but before we get there tell me a bit about

00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:02.520
[Amit Varma]: how your taste evolved during this period like out of you know what are your guilty

00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:08.920
[Amit Varma]: pleasures still out of what you used to like then what makes you cringe today and you know

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:13.240
[Amit Varma]: what parts of your early work do you look back to when you say hey that's great and

00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:19.720
[Guest]: what part is you know not quite like that so I actually look back on a large part of

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:25.800
[Guest]: that work and really was sometimes fascinated about the stuff which we did so I did all

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:30.440
[Guest]: my reality TV stuff I actually really enjoyed maybe my last show and channel which I can

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:35.400
[Guest]: get into was because the format was so bizarre and in hindsight I'm like I don't even know

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:42.840
[Guest]: what we were doing and it was a show called channel we kidnap where you would have a couple

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:47.360
[Guest]: and you would kidnap one of them and then you would make the person who's left behind

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:53.880
[Guest]: and this person's best friend compete in a series of tasks to win money and free the

00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:58.400
[Guest]: person who's been kidnapped in hindsight when I'm saying this out loud it makes no sense

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:03.760
[Guest]: we made that show we made a really like interesting show but but what I think that was us really

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:08.400
[Guest]: just enjoying a format because of the stuff we could do right so we would give them tasks

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.240
[Guest]: and each of the episode there were three producers and all of us would have one one episode each

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:16.680
[Guest]: and so we were all reliving our fantasies of stuff we wanted to do as tasks I think

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:21.320
[Guest]: we had come to that point in reality TV where producers were just thinking of the tasks

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:26.520
[Guest]: and the masala you can get like I would come up with stuff where like I put an entire basement

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.120
[Guest]: on fire and this person's outside with locked up and the keys are inside and these guys

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:35.120
[Guest]: are going with heat suits and getting the chavis out with fireballs going off and there

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.720
[Guest]: was a stunt crew and all there but and I would also do stuff like drop one of them in the

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.920
[Guest]: middle of Ganpati Visarjan and two people have to go find them in the middle of it I

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:49.680
[Guest]: got lost the camera crew got lost trying to shoot them I was groped I'm sure many of my

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:55.480
[Guest]: crew were groped as well but we would think of these really bizarre ideas thankfully the

01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:01.160
[Guest]: entire crew was men I'm just putting it out there and it was I think we're doing all of

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:07.080
[Guest]: those but in general I loved it the only things I cringe about whenever I try to do a format

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:12.280
[Guest]: that wasn't Bollywood or reality I've always been terrible at it which required editorial

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:18.520
[Guest]: or did I required finesse so I remember doing a tech show for channel B when I was there

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:23.480
[Guest]: and it required animation I'm like how tough can animation be the animator is busy so I

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:27.480
[Guest]: just made my own animation I didn't know how to animate I just learned I did something

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.800
[Guest]: random put it up on television I don't know how it went on television and suddenly the

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:35.680
[Guest]: creative director of channel B looking at TV saying what is that actually so I was pulled

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:40.840
[Guest]: up and I was like the animator was busy right so when look at some of those I was like okay

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:46.560
[Guest]: I sometimes pushed it too far with almost being cocky about it more than being lazy

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.480
[Guest]: I think I was just cocky about it because I was really I feel that once you're in a

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.920
[Guest]: certain flow and you're doing shows when you when you skip to a different format you need

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:01.200
[Guest]: to skip your mindset and I didn't skip I was still functioning the way I would I actually

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.560
[Guest]: even moved to channel B to do Bollywood shows because nobody in channel B wanted to touch

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:11.160
[Guest]: Hindi because channel B is still doing English and I love working in Bollywood for me it

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.480
[Guest]: was like okay one second I've gone to Amitabh Bachchan's house for a shoot I've gotten to

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:21.280
[Guest]: meet him shake his hand I've been able to shoot in a set with Ram Gopal Verma to create

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:26.760
[Guest]: a set for Sanjay Leela Bansali so for me I would still you know you revel in those at

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.000
[Guest]: that point of time because you have some of those things in your head and I think it was

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.120
[Guest]: great fun to do and I have a lot of fond remembrances of my entire Bollywood shoot period but I

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:40.240
[Guest]: don't cringe at any of that what I might cringe at would be me trying to do stuff which I

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:46.040
[Guest]: should not have tried doing like animation but so none of my tastes I ever cringe at

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:51.240
[Guest]: because I feel I still go back to many of them with music is a great example for me

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.360
[Guest]: I listen to every single genre possible apart from classical maybe classical something I

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.760
[Guest]: still I have a I say I have a spik makeh problem which is that and when you're younger if you

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:06.160
[Guest]: go for enough spik makeh concerts you have a certain aversion to Indian classical music

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.800
[Guest]: if you're too young to understand it so when you grow up you tend to not want to listen

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.920
[Guest]: to it it's not my mother's fault it's not anyone's fault it's just that I just did not

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:21.680
[Guest]: have taste when I was younger but yeah so I don't I don't cringe at any of those things

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:27.440
[Guest]: I would just say that doing shows like where I put animations up and doing kidnap were

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:32.720
[Guest]: two cringe pieces and kidnap actually made me also realize I wanted to quit because by

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:37.160
[Guest]: then reality TV had reached that point where you didn't have to press those buttons to

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:41.880
[Guest]: get them to react people were reacting on camera because they knew that would get them

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:48.080
[Guest]: footage so for me that took the fun away of it the fun of looking at what will psychologically

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:53.240
[Guest]: make this person react and really plan stuff out was no longer needed you could set it

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:58.360
[Guest]: up and people were reacting anyway so that they'd be seen a certain way on camera and

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:03.280
[Guest]: I'm like I'm not here to get like people to act and never really excited me so that's

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.680
[Amit Varma]: also something which made me tune out and in a sense that sort of extreme move in reality

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:13.520
[Amit Varma]: TV where people are reacting because you know it's expected of them also presages the coming

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.760
[Amit Varma]: age of social media where everything is performative anyway but you know let's take a quick commercial

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:24.360
[Amit Varma]: break and after we do we'll come back to 2009 and you know the changing times and what you

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:32.520
[Amit Varma]: then went on to do next. Long before I was a podcaster I was a writer in fact chances

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:37.680
[Amit Varma]: are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut which was active between

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:43.080
[Amit Varma]: 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time I love the freedom the form gave

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:49.240
[Amit Varma]: me and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways I exercise my writing muscle every day and

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.940
[Amit Varma]: was forced to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:58.840
[Amit Varma]: well that phase in my life ended for various reasons and now it is time to revive it only

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:06.680
[Amit Varma]: now I'm doing it through a newsletter I have started the India Uncut newsletter at IndiaUncut.substack.com

[Amit Varma]: Uncut newsletter at IndiaUncut.substack.com thank you

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.600
[Amit Varma]: welcome back to the scene and the unseen I'm chatting with Varun Duggirala about his fascinating

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:46.800
[Amit Varma]: life and journey and we've reached 2009 where obviously there is at a proximate level one

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:52.240
[Amit Varma]: interesting shift where you know you leave Channel V and you start your own advertising

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:58.560
[Amit Varma]: agency The Glitch but you've also spoken in the past about how you know it's not just

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:05.000
[Amit Varma]: a career change there's sort of a ton of stuff happening around at time television is changing

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.960
[Amit Varma]: digital is coming up the internet is changing the way people consume information and all

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:16.720
[Amit Varma]: of that so tell me a little bit about that what about those changing times is sort of

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:25.240
[Guest]: driving whatever is happening so this is I think from around 2006 2007 there was a bit

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:30.680
[Guest]: of an interesting period right it was an interesting period mainly because on one end digital was

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:35.920
[Guest]: just becoming a thing I remember Channel V used to have their website MTVIndia.com those

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:41.400
[Guest]: were early days of people really putting up curated content online and I remember there

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:46.640
[Guest]: used to be even for music I remember Arjun Ravi used to run a website forgetting the

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.480
[Guest]: name right now which which used to kind of curate stuff around indie music and so weird

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.960
[Guest]: for us who would work in music television who would go to a website which used to curate

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.800
[Guest]: indie music to kind of get what was happening there because we had gone beyond that and

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:04.160
[Guest]: we were primarily playing Bollywood by then our jobs were to do reality TV there were

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:11.360
[Guest]: very few music videos non you know regular going on and although I was lucky enough to

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:16.680
[Guest]: be one of the last people to do a show called Launchpad for Channel V which is a show to

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:23.320
[Guest]: find next big rock band and stuff like that and before rock on and everything else that

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.480
[Guest]: happened post that and I remember when we were doing that as well it was a lot about

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:33.000
[Guest]: let's find different languages who would kind of come in so we would we got a band in from

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.280
[Guest]: Cal who sang in English but Cassini's Division was a legendary band we had a Hindi band called

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:42.560
[Guest]: Farid Kote who still play they still they've composed a few movies and stuff so we had

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:47.040
[Guest]: all that going but it was still largely repetitive because I was going from one reality show

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:53.040
[Guest]: to the other I had almost quit twice I'd almost gone back to MTV because I still had one bucket

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:56.800
[Guest]: list right but I never produced roadies and I always wanted to produce roadies because

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:01.240
[Guest]: it's just a journey and the what that involved at that point of time something I always wanted

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:07.600
[Guest]: to do so I almost quit I would say I once walked up to Zulfia who was my then boss and

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:13.640
[Guest]: I was just going to quit she doesn't know this and she said do you want to launchpad

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:18.720
[Guest]: I said okay I'll stay in my head right so I stayed and I did that show and but I feel

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.960
[Guest]: that me and Rohit had come to that point where we had grown up the ranks really quickly in

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:27.000
[Guest]: our time in Channel V because when we were in Channel V and he used to shoot promos and

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.320
[Guest]: I would shoot shows there was a set of people who were senior to us who happened to quit

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.920
[Guest]: around the same time so suddenly we were assistants who suddenly became producers very quickly

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:43.160
[Guest]: and we learned those things by hook or like literally like we had to learn on the job

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:47.800
[Guest]: right so a lot of the stuff kind of were put deep into the deep end and figured it out

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:53.000
[Guest]: but when Channel V said we're not going to play music anymore and we're going youth

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.400
[Guest]: GEC we're going to do fiction that's when we're like okay we can stay here we'll have

01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:02.760
[Guest]: great careers and Rohit said I think I want to quit and do something on my own and I'm

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:06.480
[Guest]: like what are you planning to do when you say I don't know I will we'll do something

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:12.200
[Guest]: maybe try something with digital video and stuff like that I didn't know what you were

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:16.960
[Guest]: going to do he didn't know what you were going to do I said okay even I'll quit and there's

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.080
[Guest]: a line which I stick by and I stick by that most times I feel this is one of those benchmarks

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:26.880
[Guest]: you need to have is what's the worst that can happen right and so worst case we find

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.640
[Guest]: a job and it'll and this will fail because we didn't really have responsibilities right

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:37.280
[Guest]: we had to we used to say we're paying for bed bread and beer as long as had money for

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:42.360
[Guest]: those three you'd survive we spent six months thinking of the name one month trying to figure

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:46.800
[Guest]: out what work we would do quit when we when we were leaving everyone told us the mistake

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:53.720
[Guest]: was post recession India in the world at 2009 2008 was you know world was in a people really

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.080
[Guest]: were trying to hold on to their jobs and here these two young guys who are doing reasonably

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:01.600
[Guest]: well would not have lost their jobs or quitting to start a company we didn't even know who

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:08.200
[Guest]: will give us work and we had one project one and a half and we finished that project and

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.960
[Guest]: we didn't actually didn't have work for I think about two weeks two three weeks and

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:17.640
[Guest]: we were like sitting at home because we didn't know how this worked we just thought we talked

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.520
[Guest]: to a few people and we'll get some work we never got it and that's when we really started

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.960
[Guest]: to understand that we need to be open to doing anything and everything so we started off

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:30.680
[Guest]: as a production house because he used to direct I was a terrible director but I could edit

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:36.720
[Guest]: and produce so we would take turns editing I would produce and you would direct and we

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:41.000
[Guest]: just took projects like that but we kept trying to do stuff in digital so we would pitch some

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.120
[Guest]: stuff and we both geeks in our own right of the stuff we geek out on I'm both was huge

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.400
[Guest]: into tech just fiddling around with doing stuff with it so we would pitch stuff on the

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:55.320
[Guest]: side but we would still do like I remember we used to one of the first projects I'll

01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:01.600
[Guest]: never forget we used to do promos for Disney so for the DVD section so we would do a promo

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:06.160
[Guest]: for princess and the frog DVD coming out so you have this DVD come out as an animation

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:11.040
[Guest]: and and it would have a voiceover and so we get a voiceover recorded too we do projects

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:16.200
[Guest]: like that we made a we made Priyanka Chopra showreel for her to go to Hollywood one of

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:21.120
[Guest]: our first projects because I remember all the UTV DVDs had come to our house amongst

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:24.640
[Guest]: others and we had to run through all of them find those shots to show her range of acting

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:29.960
[Guest]: and and we got and we were stupid enough to take that money and go buy a TV like we would

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:36.440
[Guest]: do stuff like that in the early days but at some point I think six eight months late in

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.280
[Guest]: we did but I think yeah but we're 2010 ish we had Prashant who's actually still with

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.960
[Guest]: us who wrote in and said can I intern with you guys I'm hearing you guys are doing some

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:50.920
[Guest]: fun stuff and so he came in from Simbi realized our office was our apartment slept on a couch

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.160
[Guest]: worked on project went back and he said will you guys hire me and that's when we actually

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:59.680
[Guest]: became a company because we realized we're hiring someone and we had a few other people

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:03.560
[Guest]: and a lot of these initial set up people who weirdly connected to us even also Prashant

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:09.520
[Guest]: on his third stint with Glitch now so he quit a couple of times come back wants to be an

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:16.080
[Guest]: entrepreneur wants more to to work for Apple for a bit and there's a second employee was

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:22.160
[Guest]: a guy called Venky who came in who incidentally now works for Netflix and we end up doing

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.840
[Guest]: some stuff together in that sense right so in a weird way that a lot of these characters

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:30.760
[Guest]: were still around in our lives but that was also a time when people didn't really get

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:35.480
[Guest]: digital even I think we were looking at as a fun like it's what podcasting is now right

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:43.760
[Guest]: people it's experimental budget for all brands if at all and and so we would go pitch really

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:49.720
[Guest]: random activations and stuff that would like you know if someone tweets this to this thing

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.400
[Guest]: then a random nerf gun would fire something at a target and if you hit the target your

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.840
[Guest]: handle will come on the screen right we would we would pitch stuff like that or that we

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:05.280
[Guest]: used to do stunts like diesel was turning into and they had to make a bring people to

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.760
[Guest]: their sale website and the websites creation had taken so long they had one week for launch

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:15.680
[Guest]: and had not done any publicity so we made a bunch of hundred people change their relationship

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:21.240
[Guest]: status on Facebook from single or whatever it was to in a relationship and we had Roshan

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.800
[Guest]: who unfortunately had to go from married to in a relationship and he had to answer to

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.360
[Guest]: a few people on that front not necessarily shine because she was fine and because we

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.800
[Guest]: made them all post saying because single is boring and twosome is awesome diesel turns

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.400
[Guest]: to dot-com right so if you do stupid stuff like that and like thousand percent increase

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:44.040
[Guest]: in traffic on the website because nobody was on the website so in hindsight thousand percent

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:48.400
[Guest]: isn't much when you look at it that way but we would pitch that stuff but also do television

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:55.120
[Guest]: we would shoot stuff for having MTV was still a client been thus was a client we continue

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:59.880
[Guest]: to make that pay the bills and then slowly but surely became a company somewhere in between

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:04.280
[Guest]: and and became an agency at a later point when at some point brand said you guys are

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:09.120
[Guest]: doing all the fun stuff do you also want to do strategy and we're like how tough can it

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.520
[Guest]: be we realize it is much tougher than we thought it was but that's how we became an agency

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:18.720
[Amit Varma]: much later so you know a lot of what you're saying actually brings back memories and it's

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:24.480
[Amit Varma]: very interesting how you know our journeys over a few years apart has these sort of resonances

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:28.680
[Amit Varma]: in the sense I straight out of college I went into advertising and then channel B and then

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:35.760
[Amit Varma]: MTV and you seem to have taken kind of the reverse path and also in the late 1990s I

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.200
[Amit Varma]: you know I was one of the judges at this event called the great Indian rock which was done

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:46.680
[Amit Varma]: by Rock Street Journal and MTV together to find the next great Indian rock hope and it's

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:51.000
[Amit Varma]: around that time also that channel we announced that they were not going to be a music channel

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.080
[Amit Varma]: but a youth channel in their words around 99 and of course they didn't make the definitive

01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:00.680
[Amit Varma]: shift until much later but they carried out a grand experiment in 99 which didn't quite

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:05.800
[Amit Varma]: work out in fact I shifted back from MTV I shifted back to channel B for a second time

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:11.680
[Amit Varma]: around that period now you know my number of thoughts that come up here and number one

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:17.440
[Amit Varma]: is that you know did it make a difference that you were in a sense coming into this

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:22.480
[Amit Varma]: business of advertising not with an advertising background as you would expect that people

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.920
[Amit Varma]: have worked in ad agencies and then they've said we'll strike out on our own but from

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:32.080
[Amit Varma]: a television background so you're coming at it from a completely different angle and that

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:36.240
[Amit Varma]: makes a difference to how you look at it and what you offer and at the broader question

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.160
[Amit Varma]: is that do different angles matter because even when you come before that into media

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:44.080
[Amit Varma]: you've got that engineering background right you've done engineering and then you're doing

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.920
[Amit Varma]: mass comm so in a sense there is already a little bit of a difference between you and

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:53.800
[Amit Varma]: the other guys you know and and maybe your early love for coding played a part in that

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:58.160
[Amit Varma]: I don't know if coding you know helps you think in a more structured way or whether

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.600
[Amit Varma]: it just attracts the people who think in a more structured way and the causation is the

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:07.200
[Amit Varma]: other way around so one you know do these different frames of reference that you bring

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:12.200
[Amit Varma]: into something help you stand out from what's already in the field and that's number one

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:17.040
[Amit Varma]: and number two is that do you think that because you weren't from an agency background and

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:22.480
[Amit Varma]: you don't have those sort of set conventions and ways of looking at the world that you

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:27.680
[Amit Varma]: brought something to the table or you saw something that others did not see I feel like

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.920
[Guest]: the legacy baggage that comes with advertising right and I feel advertising suffers even

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:37.040
[Guest]: today with that I don't have any of that even though now I've been in it long enough thankfully

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:41.600
[Guest]: because there is beauty to how advertising used to be done and there are many elements

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:47.480
[Guest]: of that that still stay but it's a very different world and interestingly what's been constant

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:51.880
[Guest]: in our lives is when we got into the agency side is that we were a digital agency right

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:58.160
[Guest]: the digital agency of that time was a lot more focused on websites and banner ads and

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:05.240
[Guest]: all that stuff and and we came from production so our edge was we knew video and we knew

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:09.720
[Guest]: how that was produced so we would go and pitch stuff which nobody would even like think was

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:15.720
[Guest]: possible right like an example I remember we did something for Conetto around Valentine's

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:24.520
[Guest]: Day where we said you can I think we could tweet or write was on Facebook and give us

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:30.080
[Guest]: any lyrics and we have a set of cupids with musical instruments who would make that into

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:38.200
[Guest]: a song and post it for you to share we actually went and took 11 small tiny studios those

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:45.440
[Guest]: small ones you get in you know which you get for auditions and we dressed up guys as cupid

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:51.320
[Guest]: people who are musicians put cameras on them had an editing ready we built a software to

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:54.800
[Guest]: be able to edit that out in the software half the time did not work so we actually had to

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:59.360
[Guest]: have manual editors in place so a guy would write in meow meow and this guy would make

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.400
[Guest]: meow meow into a tune and it would go on to the page that we did that over three to four

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:10.240
[Guest]: days and what people didn't get was traditionally how even advertising video was shot was never

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:15.960
[Guest]: shot like this we were taking our learnings from the hustle that MTV and channel we had

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:20.960
[Guest]: taught us and brought it here and we would do stuff like this so by the time we got to

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:27.600
[Guest]: being an agency in an agency lens Brian said we want that we want that mindset but also

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:31.840
[Guest]: with you managing what you put on social because we were very clear we're not a social agency

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.000
[Guest]: we'll continue to do all the we'll do video we'll do interventions we'll do all of that

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.600
[Guest]: for you and and that's how it became one and then we learned the ropes of I remember when

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:44.880
[Guest]: we first started pitching stuff to do on Facebook we had people who said but Facebook's free

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:50.200
[Guest]: why should we pay you to do it right we've actually heard those things and it was so

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.520
[Guest]: interesting when I think back on it because people didn't necessarily know what to do

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.720
[Guest]: with social it was another you know in the checklist it was the lowest item that you

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:03.680
[Guest]: need to have a Facebook page you need to have a Twitter account and maybe be on Google plus

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.160
[Guest]: used to be a thing and many of those and we would just keep pitching stuff and thankfully

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:12.560
[Guest]: because of video and because we did stuff with clients so people didn't really think

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:17.680
[Guest]: about so we would go to movies right so we would do something for with YouTube motion

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:23.640
[Guest]: pictures for Burfi or we would go to Balaji motion pictures and do something so we would

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:28.760
[Guest]: go to these guys we know they'll want to experiment because shots man want to get buzzed in and

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:34.400
[Guest]: we do the bizarrest of ideas and then suddenly brands like a Unilever etc who we were doing

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:40.080
[Guest]: smaller productions for so can you do this also for us and we still kept the ship sailing

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:44.160
[Guest]: by doing TV production so we did an MTV unplugged we did a season of that we did all of you

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:49.800
[Guest]: continue to do those shows till we reached a point where we had a team who understood

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:54.120
[Guest]: so I'm not an angy person I'm still not I still look at the production and content business

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:58.800
[Guest]: thankfully have been able to stick to that my entire career Rohit's always been the more

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:03.360
[Guest]: creative person who understood the nuances to a broader extent of advertising and design

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:09.440
[Guest]: especially so he kind of focused on that and at some point Pooja came in and because Pooja

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:14.480
[Guest]: had that experience she helped bring some of that structure that agencies require which

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.200
[Guest]: we didn't have before she came in and she brought that structure in and that's why I

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:24.280
[Guest]: think it truly became an agency I think we were we were still a we were still a fun buzz-creating

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:28.240
[Guest]: agency who had a bunch of accounts but were not necessarily long-standing accounts till

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:34.240
[Guest]: Pooja came on Pooja came in a good structure but she channelized the the madness of what

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:38.400
[Guest]: we would come up with and do which would surprise everybody that this is the kind of stuff and

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.000
[Guest]: it's not just us that the team we had built over time would think of these outlandish

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.280
[Guest]: things to do like an outlandish sometimes is not the obvious so I remember when we did

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:54.920
[Guest]: the season of MTV Unplugged the biggest ask was and I remember Aditya Swamy who was then

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:59.400
[Guest]: the head of MTV had asked us and guys we're doing MTV Unplugged here but most times in

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.680
[Guest]: India you have to get a you can have to get a crowd that's not necessarily the audience

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:06.280
[Guest]: who wants to listen to the music right and we don't want to do that and because that

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.600
[Guest]: was that's additional practice most of the audience you see in all your TV shows are

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:15.280
[Guest]: paid audience you know the people are paid to sit there and clap said I want actual people

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.600
[Guest]: can you crack that for me so we figured a digital activation where we had a bus go around

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:25.480
[Guest]: Bombay saying KK is going to be doing an MTV Unplugged we'll pick you up we'll take you

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:30.240
[Guest]: to Trombe which is the outskirts of Bombay so that's the studio we were shooting it spend

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:34.600
[Guest]: the day there be in the audience figure a way to record it because most times you end

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:39.360
[Guest]: up doing some songs twice just to get a couple of extra shots get to interact with the talent

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:44.360
[Guest]: come back and so it became an experience plus a show which was never the way it was done

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:49.520
[Guest]: so we'd always find these hacks to do it and I think I'm one of our turning points was

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:56.840
[Guest]: a show called Nano Drive with MTV where we really became digital in our mindset in in

01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:02.560
[Guest]: a social world because what we were doing was he was sending four nanos into four parts

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:08.500
[Guest]: of India with four people in them and every day we would be uploading videos of what happened

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:14.640
[Guest]: in that day within that day like so shoot the whole day edit at night upload by morning

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:20.000
[Guest]: and basis the number of and think about it in hindsight this is the number of views retweets

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.140
[Guest]: or likes they got they would get points which could eventually convert into prize money

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:33.320
[Guest]: wow so and the logistical nightmare that was and this is not like post geo India this is

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:39.080
[Guest]: pre geo India so we would have those internet dongles that you would carry around every

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:44.080
[Guest]: form of internet would fail at most times some edit machine would fail in the most bizarrest

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:49.200
[Guest]: of places we did three seasons of that and I think those three seasons taught us how

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:54.160
[Guest]: social influence worked how you can really create different kinds of content online that

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:59.080
[Guest]: can get this and and because we were doing all of that it helped us with the brands because

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:03.280
[Guest]: the brand saw that we were doing these things like how much of that can we tap into so we

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:08.240
[Guest]: had that madness with some form of a strategic thought that kind of came in over time and

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.800
[Guest]: then that's a scaled up and became the agency which is why when whenever someone asked me

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:15.960
[Guest]: that I'm an advertising person now I still say I'm not an advertising person I'm still

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:20.680
[Guest]: a content person I'm still a production person because I think that at the at the root of

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:26.360
[Amit Varma]: it I'm still that and you know a fundamental question about advertising it seems that what

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:33.240
[Amit Varma]: has also happened over maybe the last 20 years is that advertising has changed in many basic

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:37.160
[Amit Varma]: ways for example you know just from the point of view of a creator one of the things that

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:41.540
[Amit Varma]: kind of delights me about the modern age is that you know if I want to connect with my

01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:46.840
[Amit Varma]: audience I can now go directly I do not need a platform and typically what would happen

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:52.080
[Amit Varma]: is I would sell whatever I am doing to a platform or make it for them they would then sell advertising

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:56.360
[Amit Varma]: and I would get a little chunk of that and now all of that loop from a creator's point

01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:00.980
[Amit Varma]: of view is completely bypassed I don't need the platform and therefore an advertising

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:07.680
[Amit Varma]: you know as you know Prem Panicker in the last episode that we did and you know he was

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:11.440
[Amit Varma]: the editor at a number of online publications like Rediff and Yahoo and all that and he

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.920
[Amit Varma]: was pointing out how it's gone from you know dollars to pennies for comparatively the same

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:22.320
[Amit Varma]: whatever so in a sense there is a sense of you know advertising going sort of downhill

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.720
[Amit Varma]: in that sense and the particular period of time which you're talking about when digital

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.760
[Amit Varma]: comes up is like like one of the things that you've spoken about earlier is how you needed

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:36.560
[Amit Varma]: to change the mindset of your clients and tell them quote don't do one big TVC you need

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.720
[Amit Varma]: 300 pieces of content in a year so instead of thinking about you know one big television

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:46.160
[Amit Varma]: commercial which they'll play everywhere and they'll buy space on you know maybe Doordarshan

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:50.640
[Amit Varma]: in the 80s or all the different satellite channels in the 90s now you gotta think of

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:58.280
[Amit Varma]: this mix of stuff how difficult was it and also the other mindset shift is that very

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:03.720
[Amit Varma]: often what happens is when a new media comes it becomes one of the boxes so you say Facebook

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:08.680
[Amit Varma]: and Instagram and you take those boxes and you're done and you don't really put your

01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:13.960
[Amit Varma]: heart into it and it's just stuff that you do and you know it becomes that kind of a

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:19.840
[Amit Varma]: game so what were these mindset shifts both in terms of getting others to sort of change

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:24.880
[Amit Varma]: their mindset in this way and your own mindset shift like one of course it helps that you

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:29.120
[Amit Varma]: come from television but did it also make a difference that you're part of a generation

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:35.360
[Amit Varma]: which is used to digital which is used to you know consuming on multiple screens as

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.080
[Amit Varma]: part of sort of your growing up and taking in the world which might have been very different

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:46.120
[Amit Varma]: from some of the sort of managers you're speaking to at these various brands a few things happened

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:51.600
[Guest]: around that time and I feel it took a certain transition you know when we first started

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:56.880
[Guest]: doing stuff that agencies do we were always those people you know you would not even sit

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:00.640
[Guest]: on the chairs around the table in those meeting rooms that you will be standing at the back

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:04.400
[Guest]: because you'd have someone talk about the campaign etc and then okay it's clay social

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.480
[Guest]: make occurring your display digital becker you almost become that at the end of it was

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:14.940
[Guest]: never the the prime point we've worked very hard I think a lot of us in that generation

01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:19.120
[Guest]: of agency there's us there's web chutney a bunch of us we work very hard to have that

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:27.080
[Guest]: seat at the team and we did that by showing a few things we showed them true value in

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:32.520
[Guest]: terms of what they could get out of it and I feel the learning has been in three stages

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:36.480
[Guest]: consumers learned first because consumer behavior move very quickly right as soon as they could

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:41.240
[Guest]: get the internet and start doing stuff with it consumers adopted this like that this whole

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:46.460
[Guest]: mobile first India piece is so important to think about because we tend to compare things

01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:52.520
[Guest]: to how the West does it and the West even now for me is a lot more drilled on from laptop

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:57.840
[Guest]: and computer culture India is very mobile culture like that's how our consumers function

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:02.840
[Guest]: that's a very important distinction to make us be very naturally that way I go back to

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:06.200
[Guest]: my AOL call center days and I think about how they were and the issues they had and

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:12.160
[Guest]: I remember that they were so analog even at that time and so because of that what happened

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:16.080
[Guest]: here was that a the consumer shifting and the brands are trying to figure out what to

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:21.800
[Guest]: do the brands adapted first I have to give them credit for that most brands including

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:26.760
[Guest]: larger ones like I feel like even someone like a Unilever who's fairly large I have

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:31.680
[Guest]: seen that transition from how they were when we started working with them in way back in

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:37.480
[Guest]: 2011 to now and even then it was a focus area for them they were still figuring it out and

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.600
[Guest]: now it's a prime focus area for them so I've seen that with many of them so they who kind

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:48.040
[Guest]: of moved early agencies moved last agencies for me not necessarily guys like us who were

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.000
[Guest]: anyway doing what we were doing and didn't really care about the traditional stuff the

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.640
[Guest]: traditional players in many ways because they also were doing a lot of things which weren't

01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.760
[Guest]: really threatened as much by digital then so was doing what they were really good at

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:06.120
[Guest]: like you making great television commercials and you were doing you know those those long

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:11.920
[Guest]: planning sessions and all of those things and at some point when these two moved fast

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:17.520
[Guest]: and then you had a bunch of these brands coming in who was selling only on digital that you

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:25.080
[Guest]: have your your startups or your d2c brands and when that happened stuff moved so quickly

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:28.760
[Guest]: that's when the agency space really got disrupted because brands suddenly switch quickly to

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:34.080
[Guest]: say okay let's put because for a brand in many cases become easier because once again

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:38.760
[Guest]: this completes my loop I can see where my products being sold what piece of marketing

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:46.360
[Guest]: for me will is getting me to get someone to hit buy on a website and suddenly so they

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:51.640
[Guest]: start moving quickly and everybody started to adapt and now we're in another weird point

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:55.080
[Guest]: of flux in the industry which is what I find interesting and it's already happening but

01:28:55.080 --> 01:29:00.080
[Guest]: I see the largest option happening is that right before the agency is for the central

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:07.360
[Guest]: point of creativity now I feel the brands are agencies are helping facilitate the creativity

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:11.240
[Guest]: in many ways I'm it's very I know there will be people who will tell me what I've seen

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:17.200
[Guest]: right now is sacrilege but I truly believe that I feel that brands are taking the ownership

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:21.120
[Guest]: of the overall brand and creativity a lot more now than they ever did you know just

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:26.000
[Guest]: because it is easier to go to an agency and they would handle it for years the number

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.360
[Guest]: of pitches that will happen the number of people who will come in for each and every

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:35.560
[Guest]: project the number of collaborations that are required I am seeing more and more the

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:39.720
[Guest]: brand teams are filled with people who are thinking of it from a creative lens and so

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:46.600
[Guest]: they're pulling in collaborators so the agency's role is almost to be in a way your navigator

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:52.120
[Guest]: saying okay great set of things don't do this this is how it will affect you or you want

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:57.160
[Guest]: to produce 50,000 pieces of creative in a year this is how I can help you do it at the

01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:00.960
[Guest]: best ROI or this is how you need to work with data this is how you need to work with your

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:06.680
[Guest]: media so we are navigators now we're not necessarily people holding the rails in that sense right

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:13.400
[Guest]: so that's the ship that's happened everyone's adapting to it but when I look at how our

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:18.240
[Guest]: journey has been and look at how things have changed I think the change has really been

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:23.480
[Guest]: the day you could turn around from being a marketing team that would say I'm helping

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:28.520
[Guest]: you market your product to saying I'm a marketing that helps sell your product that's when the

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:35.480
[Guest]: whole game changed because suddenly you are actually controlling sales and that just changes

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:39.200
[Guest]: the whole game because you suddenly have that happening and then your distribution channels

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:44.280
[Guest]: of old which were you know what's your channel of sending it to different stores across the

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:47.880
[Guest]: country and all of that and suddenly ecom came in and suddenly those didn't matter right

01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:54.280
[Guest]: so you can have a tiny startup who just distributing off online who can hit as much sales as some

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:59.120
[Guest]: of the biggest established players of decades or if not longer so that's really been the

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:04.240
[Amit Varma]: change so you know I want to drill down on something interesting you said like you know

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:08.760
[Amit Varma]: when I joined advertising in 94 there was this old quote going around or not this old

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:12.200
[Amit Varma]: quote going around then but I heard it then by John Wanamaker saying half the money I

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:16.880
[Amit Varma]: spent on advertising is wasted but I don't know which half and when I did a recent episode

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:22.800
[Amit Varma]: with Ambi Parmeswaran the ad guru he spoke about how a lot of digital marketing or digital

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:27.240
[Amit Varma]: advertising is prey and prey that you know you don't really know what's going on and

01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.960
[Amit Varma]: I chatted with him about metrics as well which I want to ask you about because you pointed

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.560
[Amit Varma]: out that you know you said that there was a shift where brands began to take attention

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.200
[Amit Varma]: of you when they realized that you're not just going to help them market the product

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:44.320
[Amit Varma]: you're going to help them sell it does this to drill down in this does it then mean that

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:48.760
[Amit Varma]: what you are doing the kind of advertising that you are doing is actually quantifiable

01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:54.120
[Amit Varma]: that there are metrics that can actually show the impact so that old dilemma of I don't

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:58.480
[Amit Varma]: know you know whether this is truly effective or not it's just a box I have to take does

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:05.160
[Amit Varma]: that old dilemma then go away is it possible to quantify effectiveness so it's extremely

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:10.240
[Guest]: quantifiable to a larger extent than it has been before provided this is the one big provider

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:14.960
[Guest]: that you set what you're what are you setting benchmarks against like what do you want to

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:20.720
[Guest]: achieve and that's really important many times when that gets missed no matter what you might

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:26.440
[Guest]: get as metrics whatever might happen that is where you end up failing and it's also

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:30.600
[Guest]: an iterative game it's no longer okay let's make that one perfect piece and have it go

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:35.160
[Guest]: there so it's also iterative so you're trying stuff out seeing something that works doesn't

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:39.040
[Guest]: work I give an old television analogy that you know how you would program a television

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:42.840
[Guest]: channel for the shows and what would follow what and what you would make a programming

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:45.840
[Guest]: calendar for the year that's what brands are doing now right so you'll have some stuff

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:51.320
[Guest]: that will fail some stuff that will work but at the end of the year you're looking back

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:54.560
[Guest]: and say I did a bunch of these things these things didn't work these things worked these

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:59.720
[Guest]: are my learnings and I'm moving ahead next year and and that's really the way it is happening

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:04.880
[Guest]: I agree with ambi I think that there's a lot of the so measurement is a tricky thing because

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:10.240
[Guest]: I feel that the word data is thrown around very very in a very loose form data is not

01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:16.040
[Guest]: important what data you look at and how we interpret is important so in most cases what

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:22.280
[Guest]: happens is you will try to find data to prove what your idea is to be right rather than

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:27.200
[Guest]: looking at data and deriving your idea from it which is the right way to do it so there's

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:32.600
[Guest]: this piece that we say in office a lot um i know roid says it uh the most is that data

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:37.680
[Guest]: is a creative director's best friend because what you would have you know the quintessential

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:41.360
[Guest]: creative director would walk around outside find inspiration in something and kind of

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:45.800
[Guest]: come back now it's that same creator looking at a stream of data and really getting some

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:51.600
[Guest]: insights from that so it's it's about how you look at it and i feel and again data and

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:58.040
[Guest]: content two words that are the most widely used for for bizarrely random reasons uh across

01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:03.040
[Guest]: the industry but data is truly just that you're getting the insights you would get by doing

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:07.440
[Guest]: 10 market visits talking to 50 100 consumers you're getting that by looking at the stream

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:12.880
[Guest]: of a piece on a monitor um and as long as you use that right um then that's good data

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.480
[Guest]: and i think we're also moving towards a slightly more secure form of doing this right we're

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:20.480
[Guest]: moving towards first party data we're moving towards all of that and i think while that

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:26.400
[Guest]: does affect the business i feel it's important because at some point the consumer should

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:32.920
[Guest]: not be the product and i feel that at some times the tendency is to use data to kind

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:37.560
[Guest]: of get to them as the best way you can for the business but it's important to kind of

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:41.320
[Guest]: have that difference in your head but i think that thankfully it is the way i've seen most

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:45.280
[Guest]: brands are very who we've worked with have always been very cognizant of that you know

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:49.720
[Guest]: there's a line and they don't necessarily want to cross it and you know you called your

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:54.080
[Amit Varma]: podcast when you started it advertising is dead and which is of course a provocative

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:58.520
[Amit Varma]: title coming from an ad man though you claim you're not an ad man but what the hell uh

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:02.840
[Amit Varma]: now what is the scene for advertising is it actually dying because it strikes me that

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:07.000
[Amit Varma]: you know when i look at it from the content point of view a lot of the content i consume

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.720
[Amit Varma]: most of the content i consume has no advertising i've put ad blockers on my browser i subscribe

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:17.680
[Amit Varma]: to netflix and amazon prime and i'm you know consuming from there i literally don't watch

01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:22.560
[Amit Varma]: any television the only advertising i consume is possibly during cricket matches when i

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:28.280
[Amit Varma]: can you know just mute the damn thing and similarly as a creator i find that now whatever

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:33.580
[Amit Varma]: money i make is coming directly from people it is not coming through i mean i do get some

01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:39.560
[Amit Varma]: advertising thankfully on my show after all this time but it's a small chunk of what i

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:44.240
[Amit Varma]: otherwise make and the direction in general seems to be even for creators to not have

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:49.920
[Amit Varma]: to rely on it so much so now the point is that if content is not uh you know reliant

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:54.000
[Amit Varma]: on advertising you know if that bridge is broken people are willing to just pay directly

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.680
[Amit Varma]: for content what's the future for advertising you know what are your sort of thoughts on

01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:03.000
[Amit Varma]: this because i am looking at it very much from uh the outside this is not something

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.440
[Guest]: i have ever thought deeply about so enlighten me so there are a few things that are happening

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:13.080
[Guest]: which is why sometimes you think about is the term agency or advertising right for what

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:20.640
[Guest]: we do there are parts to what the agency business is right now one big chunk is digital transformation

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:26.840
[Guest]: so you're helping clients to transform every part of their operation to digital right so

01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:30.760
[Guest]: in some ways you're competing on one end with an accenture and a deloitte etc because you're

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:35.500
[Guest]: helping them build those large tech builds so everything from looking at how they function

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:40.680
[Guest]: internally how to add digital elements into that adding tech into that process flows everything

01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:44.240
[Guest]: well so there's that's one part big part of what agencies are doing now then there is

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:48.400
[Guest]: a big amount of work we're doing even on like i think the technology part of the agency

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:52.200
[Guest]: business now is so large it doesn't get talked about enough uh you know you're doing stuff

01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:57.560
[Guest]: around salesforce implementation crm you're doing a lot of that and i see a lot of that

01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:03.040
[Guest]: growing and scaling and it's being very stable businesses for agencies the creative part

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:09.440
[Guest]: of the business i feel is the one that is actually died in some form um when i think

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:15.920
[Guest]: of how the classical way of it right i think the so i you know that i'm a huge scott galloway

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:21.120
[Guest]: fanboy one of the things he says which i always like is that he says advertising is the tax

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:25.840
[Guest]: of the poor he was the word poor i don't like the word poor but all of the people who can't

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:29.240
[Guest]: pay for subscription is how i like to term it um and i think that's important there's

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:33.240
[Guest]: still a large amount of people who still are okay to get something for free with an ad

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:38.680
[Guest]: in between and eventually they will pay for uh you know not getting those ads in between

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:43.720
[Guest]: uh you know their content so that's still relevant what i feel is important to note

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:48.600
[Guest]: is that whatever you make as advertising now has to be relevant for the audience now and

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:53.640
[Guest]: not the old um for instance whenever someone talks about okay did you see the ads during

01:37:53.640 --> 01:38:00.040
[Guest]: the ipl i say that you realize when an ad comes on people are looking at their phone

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.880
[Guest]: because if they're watching it on tv they're looking at their phone they're not necessarily

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:08.640
[Guest]: paying attention to the ad right so um then what are you making on as an ad that is playing

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:14.240
[Guest]: on their on that phone for me is more relevant than what's playing on tv um and i think those

01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:21.920
[Guest]: nuances are there so content will still always be the prime focus on the creative side but

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:26.160
[Guest]: when whatever you're creating now has to have far bigger legs as a piece that you would

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:31.800
[Guest]: share when i think of some of the biggest disruptors in the ads some of the not disruptors

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:36.800
[Guest]: some people have done the most brilliant work in recent times like for me maximum effort

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:42.920
[Guest]: uh which is ryan reynolds's brand company is a phenomenal case study right like here's

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:49.760
[Guest]: a guy who is so creative as an actor and everything else and he's genuinely funny builds this

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:54.080
[Guest]: company that does really interesting pieces around some of the brands he owns and the

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:58.440
[Guest]: movies he works on that they are now considered to be some of the most innovative coming up

01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:02.040
[Guest]: with some of the most innovative ideas around stuff that happens and he's doing that because

01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:08.080
[Guest]: he's thinking digital he's thinking what is shareable and he's thinking on the fly versus

01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:11.280
[Guest]: you don't have two months to come up with a script and shoot something you know how

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:16.880
[Guest]: do you do it um martin sorrell famously says faster better cheaper is his focus now with

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:22.440
[Guest]: media monks and s4 and what he's doing and clients want faster better cheaper but i feel

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:27.320
[Guest]: clients also want true value and i feel that that's what we're doing so whenever we're

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:31.040
[Guest]: creating we're also not just talking about the creative idea we talk about how creating

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:36.000
[Guest]: it a certain way will make them spend lesser in the short term and in the long term i use

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:41.960
[Guest]: the word tech stack more than i've ever done in production context over the last year and

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:47.560
[Guest]: a half than i ever have so the actual part which you've always spoken about in advertising

01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:51.600
[Guest]: which is okay let's make the film and let's talk about something so i have not spent any

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:56.480
[Guest]: time doing that in in recent years i know a large amount of my team focus a lot on the

01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:01.520
[Guest]: strategy part and that's still very relevant we're still thinking long term but the classical

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:06.960
[Guest]: madman-esque advertising for me is dead because that's now a small part of what brands will

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:13.280
[Guest]: do um in the future and that's going to go down more and more what will stay is what

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.480
[Guest]: all are you creating to connect to every single category of consumer so you know and all of

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:22.360
[Guest]: that stuff so and i've given a slightly long winding and and and you know in most cases

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:28.400
[Guest]: random response to your question but there are so many pieces to the advertising business

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:33.560
[Guest]: now that what was traditionally known as the ad business is now a small part of it it's

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:40.000
[Amit Varma]: no longer the whole of it that's fascinating so again i'll think aloud and you know i hope

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.960
[Amit Varma]: you and other people who really know advertising will forgive me if this next question is a

01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:49.400
[Amit Varma]: bit naive but let's do a thought experiment you know you just spoke about how scott galloway

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:54.120
[Amit Varma]: spoke about advertising being a tax on the poor and uh so on let's do a thought experiment

01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:58.200
[Amit Varma]: let's say that at some point in the future and hopefully sooner or later either we go

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:03.320
[Amit Varma]: extinct or this happens there's a sort of post scarcity world where in a sense nobody

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:08.840
[Amit Varma]: is too poor to pay for content so everyone's paying for content nobody needs to have their

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:14.000
[Amit Varma]: attention um you know sold as a product so to say which is what advertising uh typically

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:21.160
[Amit Varma]: is and uh so what does the advertiser do because on the one hand as a consumer i do want to

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:27.440
[Amit Varma]: know what is out there and uh all of that but at the same time i don't want any intrusions

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:32.200
[Amit Varma]: uh on my attention if i'm watching content i want to watch content you know i'm like

01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:36.560
[Amit Varma]: obviously i'm one of the privilege but i i'm subscribing to youtube premium so even there

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:44.440
[Amit Varma]: i don't see ads netflix prime all of that and presumably there will be similar options

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:49.960
[Amit Varma]: for any kind of content at all so thought experiment utopian or dystopian world for

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:55.000
[Amit Varma]: the advertising people where so then what does a brand do how do brands reach people

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.800
[Amit Varma]: what is advertising then is an agency just the people who are doing tech backends and

01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:05.480
[Amit Varma]: crm and you know whatever else you spoke about or how are they actually managing to get their

01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:09.440
[Guest]: products in front of the consumer a large part of what you said is already happening

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:15.640
[Guest]: and i feel it's already a point in in focus so think of what you consume which brands

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.840
[Guest]: are all still a part of even though they're not ads right um think of the entire creator

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:24.800
[Guest]: and influencer economy the influencer economy especially right so people do follow so many

01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:29.080
[Guest]: creators slash influencers primarily because of the brand stuff so which is why a lot of

01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:34.760
[Guest]: the startups focus so much on that and and i've noticed this right you'll have a startup

01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:41.200
[Guest]: they'll they'll do primary focus on performance marketing and e-commerce do influencer marketing

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:46.920
[Guest]: raise a few rounds come to that get that series a round in then go get that big agency do

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:51.520
[Guest]: that big campaign right because in a country like india i feel for at least in the near

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:56.320
[Guest]: future you traditional mediums are still relevant tv is not going anywhere hoardings aren't

01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:00.640
[Guest]: going anywhere a lot of that stuff is still here to stay print i have my own questions

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:05.640
[Guest]: on but that's i think more in terms of maybe my habit than i think the like i know people

01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:11.920
[Guest]: that in my house here read the newspaper right i don't um and so i feel that's more my own

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:18.840
[Guest]: personal uh prejudice if that's the word to use and so when i look at it from that sense

01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:24.480
[Guest]: the advertising business in the future will exist wherever brands are they have to connect

01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:31.640
[Guest]: with the consumer today it's on an instagram on an amazon on um you know on a youtube it

01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:38.080
[Guest]: might not necessarily just be as an ad i've spent the last year also studying how creators

01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:42.760
[Guest]: monetize and because i thought okay as a podcaster there's there are certain regular ways that

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:45.760
[Guest]: you're known to monetize what are the other ways and i realize there's so much happening

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:50.200
[Guest]: which weirdly enough i didn't know about even though i work in the space right so the amazon

01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:55.360
[Guest]: affiliate program for me was a revelation i didn't realize it because i realized a lot

01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:00.600
[Guest]: of the tech youtubers i follow all have almost packs you can buy and they make some money

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:04.960
[Guest]: off the fact because you know you follow someone and that guy uses certain equipment you know

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:09.120
[Guest]: okay fine i love the content so this must be legit equipment so you'd end up buying

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:13.600
[Guest]: it and so this person gets something for it similarly how we put some products out there

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:18.600
[Guest]: you know and so i feel that part is going to scale up more and more each individual

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:23.760
[Guest]: now is a media channel to themselves and eventually maybe the entire world is going to be an influencer

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:27.520
[Guest]: at different categories and everybody can just kind of keep making money by putting

01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:31.600
[Guest]: stuff out there right i mean from what i hear and i don't know enough about it in china

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:35.920
[Guest]: they've reached a far more advanced stage in this journey than than the rest of the

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:42.840
[Guest]: world has on the other end i feel the traditional ad is going to be one of those big once in

01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:47.400
[Guest]: a year blockbuster things right so say how in the us we have the super bowl they have

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:52.160
[Guest]: the super bowl we have the ipl i feel you'll end up having some of these big movement pieces

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:56.840
[Guest]: which will have ads happen i don't think that's going away they'll evolve in how they are

01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:01.520
[Guest]: they might become may become content pieces might become cds might become shows you'll

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:06.360
[Guest]: have all those forms and you know brands will invest more and more in this i know brands

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:11.280
[Guest]: who are looking at what they do from an editorial mindset now right so you know you look at

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:15.280
[Guest]: a brand circuit why would you follow a brand online is because not because you want to

01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:19.680
[Guest]: see their ad because you want to see what is something about the content they post excites

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:25.840
[Guest]: you or interests you and at some point brands are making that shift to an editorial mindset

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:31.120
[Guest]: so suddenly the content they're putting out is content to itself not necessarily selling

01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:38.160
[Guest]: their product um and i use this this term a lot i said consumers either come to you

01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:42.400
[Guest]: to get two forms of value one is that you're giving them some value like a great deal you

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:46.080
[Guest]: give them something like that or they'll come to you to connect to their values in some

01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:51.440
[Guest]: way and that values doesn't have to seem very hardcore it could be just a form of entertainment

01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:56.760
[Guest]: or a genre that you like which really works i mean i i think of a bunch of brands which

01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:02.320
[Guest]: are there online which i follow because i just am entertained by what they post and

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:05.960
[Guest]: i think that's really the future the future is that we'll go brands will go a lot more

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:11.720
[Guest]: editorial and they'll realize at some point that that editorial content is also monetizable

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:16.960
[Guest]: it'll be a tiny piece of their pnl but let's say tomorrow if i'm a beauty brand and i'm

01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:22.360
[Guest]: doing a lot of these tutorials and everything else and packs and stuff like that at some

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:27.080
[Guest]: point it's helping me sell but what if some of that content is exclusive what if some

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:35.480
[Guest]: of that stuff is only for a subscription-based cohort of consumers and i'm just i'm freewheeling

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:40.160
[Guest]: here in my head maybe someone would pay for that you never know right i mean maybe that's

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:46.240
[Guest]: the future maybe that's the future of what we'll build out as agencies because as long

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:51.200
[Guest]: as brands have to connect with a consumer there'll be some form of this thing called

01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:56.760
[Guest]: the agency will it be what it was i don't think so which is why the name of the show

01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:02.000
[Guest]: came in the name of the show actually interestingly came from a talk squad gal away game so advertising

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.640
[Guest]: is that comes from this thing he keeps saying called the death of there was a video he did

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:12.200
[Guest]: i forgot where i think it was a video from his stern school class where he said the death

01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:20.320
[Guest]: of the advertising and industrial um no advertising and marketing um industrial something and

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:25.040
[Guest]: so i said it's too long but if you break it down and advertising is dead is is an interesting

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:28.800
[Guest]: term to use and that's how the name of the show kind of came to be so that's what i truly

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.640
[Guest]: believe i think we're already there um it's just that and it's a good thing that you hold

01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:37.080
[Guest]: on to certain things which are great there are many beautiful things about how advertising

01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:42.680
[Guest]: has been which i've come to learn after becoming part of a network i never realized that while

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:47.880
[Guest]: i was an independent agency but i don't think we're a generation who is nostalgic about

01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:51.400
[Guest]: this at least i am not i know the people who are young i know there are a bunch of them

01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:57.160
[Guest]: who are i'm not i think things evolve you move ahead you can't stay in the past you

01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:03.040
[Guest]: enjoy those you kind of go back and look at those but um yeah i mean so that's that form

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:08.000
[Amit Varma]: of agency that's going to stay so you know i i'm going to uh get some of your thoughts

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.520
[Amit Varma]: on the uh content ecosystem and the creator ecosystem as well because that's something

01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:17.200
[Amit Varma]: i've also been thinking a lot about over the last one year these are exciting times but

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:22.440
[Amit Varma]: before that uh you know to kind of wrap up your uh not your thoughts on advertising per

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:28.160
[Amit Varma]: se but that part of the journey you know at one point you got acquired by wpp and i assume

01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:33.160
[Amit Varma]: things have worked out extremely well for you so you know there is a journey where around

01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:36.800
[Amit Varma]: 2009 you leave channel v you say okay this is interesting work this is what we're going

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.640
[Amit Varma]: to do you get down to it you go in the directions and you follow those directions and then you

01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:46.120
[Amit Varma]: have what i presume is your big payday and you can now chill and do whatever you want

01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:50.320
[Amit Varma]: but one you are still in advertising you're still part of the glitch you're still uh sort

01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:55.820
[Amit Varma]: of doing whatever and at the same time you are also exploring these other new directions

01:48:55.820 --> 01:49:01.800
[Amit Varma]: with first one podcast and then this uh youtube uh podcast of arundhati show and all of that

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:05.840
[Amit Varma]: so my question is that you know in one of your newsletters you've written about how

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.520
[Amit Varma]: you need to think about what you're doing for your career and what you're doing for

01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:16.000
[Amit Varma]: your life uh in the sense that you have to view one as the means to an end and so how

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:21.160
[Amit Varma]: have your thoughts of sort of you know the kind of work that you want to do evolved over

01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:26.960
[Amit Varma]: these last 12 or 13 years since you started the glitch you know where initially you go

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:30.680
[Amit Varma]: out there saying hey we'll you know we'll make me videos for digital and we'll do all

01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:37.040
[Amit Varma]: of that and then in that journey presumably as a company grows your mindset is also changing

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:41.300
[Amit Varma]: you're putting your different kinds of processes in place your goals are changing then the

01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:45.680
[Amit Varma]: acquisition happens then you discover you know the creator ecosystem and how that's

01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:51.480
[Amit Varma]: going but at the same time you have one foot and you're still running the glitch so take

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:56.960
[Guest]: me through your thinking on all of this so when we started glitch rohit and i chose not

01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:00.560
[Guest]: to have traditional designations we were called left brain and right brain i was left and

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:04.720
[Guest]: he was right because we thought that sounded cooler but also it felt very like and we just

01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:08.640
[Guest]: found it very weird that two guys start a company one becomes ceo one becomes cco and

01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:13.920
[Guest]: because we decided none of us will be neither of us will be ceo so puja has been our first

01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:19.680
[Guest]: ceo which because the designation didn't exist before she came on so my role was always very

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:26.600
[Guest]: operations oriented right because of my experience with reality tv i knew how to do logistics

01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:32.680
[Guest]: so stuff like administration terrible math person but managed finance for the longest

01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:40.360
[Guest]: time with on a with a in hindsight a very very junior team and not really really focus

01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:45.840
[Guest]: on that as much as we should have but my role is always that my role was to make a few things

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:51.560
[Guest]: happen is to make sure that the ship ran work with rohit to make sure the stuff we sold

01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:54.640
[Guest]: and that's something which he took on us on his own stuff we sold would really come through

01:50:54.640 --> 01:51:00.600
[Guest]: and executed right i had to take care of is there enough money in the bank is there you

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:05.320
[Guest]: know just kind of getting people in managing their life so i've always had that role i

01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:11.280
[Guest]: always enjoyed that having those 50 things to do over the years what also happened is

01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:17.000
[Guest]: i kind of brought in people who took certain things off our plate and eventually once we

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.560
[Guest]: came towards and we didn't we never thought being acquired was a thing like we didn't

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:25.880
[Guest]: even know that existed till someone approached us many years before we even got acquired

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:30.080
[Guest]: and we were like okay this is something that happens we actually even worked with the team

01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:35.880
[Guest]: and i remember the team kind of came on because in 2011 um roshan came on to be our first

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:40.160
[Guest]: investor and he was one person who would keep telling us these are things that will come

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:45.120
[Guest]: ahead for you and i feel that he's kind of great person to have had as a mentor partner

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:49.480
[Guest]: because he would never tell us what to do he would tell us something like this will

01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:52.740
[Guest]: come up and i will let you guys take a choice and maybe give you a point of view from my

01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:57.680
[Guest]: experience but i will not make your choice for you so we had him to help us out with

01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:04.320
[Guest]: a lot of those decisions and and at some point by the time we decided to get acquired because

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:09.920
[Guest]: we realized that's the way to go if you want to scale the way we want to scale um and and

01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:14.440
[Guest]: at this base at which we wanted to we then end up trying to choose networks and went

01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:21.400
[Guest]: through that and i think post the acquisition when when we finally did get acquired in 2018

01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:26.000
[Guest]: i was at a point when i handed over a lot of my response so i no longer had to look

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.880
[Guest]: at finance ops was pretty much out of my this thing because at some point you hand over

01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:35.400
[Guest]: a bunch so i was left with a few things to do and i always like to have different things

01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:39.920
[Guest]: to do and this kind of just happened the podcasting may happen kind of filled a gap of stuff i

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:44.400
[Guest]: wanted to because i had also gotten very comfortable i get very nervous when i'm comfortable right

01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:49.080
[Guest]: when you sit and you feel like okay have a relaxed day most days that's when i get really

01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:53.200
[Guest]: like i panic a little bit because i'm like i'm worried that when things are too relaxed

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:57.080
[Guest]: something can go wrong i'm happy when there is some stress to deal with in the 50 things

01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:02.040
[Guest]: going on so and that's when this thing happened and then i've done i feel it's also fed back

01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:08.600
[Guest]: very beautifully to what i do at glitch so i come back to the team i come back to clients

01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:13.360
[Guest]: i come back with with perspectives and insights which i wouldn't have gotten if i didn't do

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:17.480
[Guest]: the podcast not just from the guests i get a lot from the guests i feel like every guest

01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:23.040
[Guest]: i learn something from but i also feel like i've learned a lot about the talent out there

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:26.160
[Guest]: who wants to work in this space because i interact with a large part of my audience

01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:32.520
[Guest]: also wants to work in this entire new business world and you also then get insights into

01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:37.880
[Guest]: tools that creators use and and so i'll go back to the guys in our production team with

01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:42.800
[Guest]: hacks which i am thinking of which they might not use like somebody used to using bigger

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:47.000
[Guest]: equipment something something which is very like you know which is tiny which is a youtuber

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.960
[Guest]: piece like okay where did you get this from and so like and so all of that kind of adds

01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:58.360
[Guest]: up but my role over time have while i've played many roles like you know there are certain

01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:01.680
[Guest]: clients i've had great relationships with and kind of built that over time there'll

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:06.880
[Guest]: be times when i'll pop so i've always been a person who filled gaps and gave support

01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:11.960
[Guest]: my job is always i still consider that to be my job is just that over time we've luckily

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:17.440
[Guest]: had people who came into the system who said okay i'll take care of things still like we

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:22.000
[Guest]: have this thing called shit hitting the fan and there's only this the level to which people

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.440
[Guest]: can manage that hitting the fan has increased so when it still comes to us it's still going

01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:32.360
[Guest]: to be a big problem to deal with but thankfully now we have a solid set of people leading

01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:36.440
[Guest]: the organization who take care of a lot of that and so i think that's what i enjoy which

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:40.100
[Guest]: is why i think the creative thing happened because i suddenly go let me get my hands

01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:48.040
[Guest]: dirty after being in a leadership role for so long what i don't want to do is to have

01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:52.160
[Guest]: too much of a team which is why i really like it's very shoestring in terms of even the

01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:55.880
[Guest]: guys that you work with on the varun dogi show i'm like i don't hire someone i'll work

01:54:55.880 --> 01:55:01.320
[Guest]: with the team which is established and so i i'm very wary of falling into the trap of

01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:06.400
[Guest]: again becoming this person who is taking care of an organized set of people like i don't

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:11.160
[Guest]: want to deal with hr again in parallel and then stuff i like we have a fabulous hr team

01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:15.400
[Guest]: now thankfully take that off my plate as well so yeah so that's how my role has evolved

01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:24.880
[Guest]: and it's um i genuinely find that it's great to work with people from this generation because

01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:30.560
[Guest]: i feel that they have a very interesting mindset and i feel that so i'm late i'm very like

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:38.560
[Guest]: on the border millennial because 82 kind of just hits that line there but i feel now the

01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:42.720
[Guest]: term purpose while people make fun of the fact that gen z has this thing purpose and

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:48.280
[Guest]: whatnot i feel they truly want to do stuff which kind of connects to what they really

01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:53.040
[Guest]: believe in um and at some point we need to be able to do enough to be able to connect

01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:57.280
[Guest]: to that and and the constant endeavor is to do that i don't think we succeed all the time

01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:05.000
[Guest]: as a business world it's not decided i think in general but i find that so beautiful about

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.960
[Guest]: and i don't know what gen alpha is going to be like but i think gen z at least has that

01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:13.440
[Guest]: and um and so that's one thing which really excites me i think my podcast helps me connect

01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:20.400
[Guest]: with this group of people who i find so fascinating who i feel have a lot of the pressures every

01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:25.000
[Guest]: generation has but also lives in a world like you said right which is a constantly everything

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.800
[Guest]: you say is on the record everything there's so much pressure there is your mental health

01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:34.400
[Guest]: has taken a beating because of everything else and so in some way kind of giving back

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:39.040
[Amit Varma]: to making sure telling them the world will be okay right there are many many things to

01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:43.920
[Amit Varma]: unpack there but i'll begin by asking a question on leadership like you've in the past quoted

01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:49.080
[Amit Varma]: mandela talking about how a good leader should lead from the back right so how how did you

01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:55.360
[Amit Varma]: sort of discover and evolve your leadership or your managerial style because that seems

01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:59.480
[Amit Varma]: to be something which you have a very settled version of now which has come over a period

01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:04.560
[Amit Varma]: of time did that come through trial and error were there moments where you had to reorient

01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:10.640
[Guest]: yourself and so on some pieces were already set in place by the time we started glitch

01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:15.440
[Guest]: because i also led smaller teams right so again i go back to like reality tv you're

01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:20.240
[Guest]: dealing with the team of people that you have producers you have a camera crew production

01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:27.040
[Guest]: team so i had some nuances of how to handle a widespread set of people roid jokes that

01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:32.960
[Guest]: i use a lot of my troops from reality tv contestants on employees in the early years because i'm

01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:36.960
[Guest]: like how do you deal with this person if the person's mindset is this way so i might have

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:41.760
[Guest]: in all honesty there is a strong possibility i could have done that but in general i've

01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:50.440
[Guest]: always so i've never been a person who gets to what i put it i'm not angry very easily

01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:55.480
[Guest]: that i don't get i get flustered but i try not to show it too much with a team because

01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:59.880
[Guest]: i feel that it only seeps down and naturally try to be the person to try and find a solve

01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:04.560
[Guest]: and move ahead have i lost my shit sometimes have i said stuff which i shouldn't have said

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:08.000
[Guest]: have i dealt with the situations wrong of course but i think i've learned from those

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:14.760
[Guest]: and over time um kind of developed a style which was um and i think it also comes back

01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:17.320
[Guest]: to the fact that i don't necessarily want to sit in the room saying i am the center

01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:23.000
[Guest]: of attention i never wanted to be that person i still not i think even as a creator now

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.000
[Guest]: i'm not putting out videos which say okay this is what my quote is this is what i have

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.800
[Guest]: said that i am literally trying to share as much of the people i talk to rather than what

01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:38.360
[Guest]: i say and i think there's there's so much in that and i feel that i did that as in glitch

01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:42.520
[Guest]: as well is that i would have come in there i've got a great bunch of people together

01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:47.440
[Guest]: how do i help them do what they do want to do by with taking off all the headaches if

01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:52.560
[Guest]: they have um you know it could be you know at some point companies become bureaucratic

01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:58.080
[Guest]: we we so have we we have many parts which are bureaucratic at some point there are stuff

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:02.960
[Guest]: which like you know like like reading a contract or looking at you know there are those things

01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:08.920
[Guest]: which are not exciting for a larger part of the people you hire so i would take care of

01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:14.280
[Guest]: those um by instinct of saying okay let them do what they're doing um i can take care of

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:18.880
[Guest]: these once in a while i'll get a project which i'm really kicked apart and i would do that

01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:24.720
[Guest]: um and and and so on and so forth so i think my style evolved because um i naturally gravitate

01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:31.120
[Guest]: towards logistics i enjoy it i'm actually very unstructured but i still enjoy logistics

01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:35.240
[Guest]: and i that's why i took to production so well because production in india is a very unstructured

01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:41.080
[Guest]: business it's very it's like the wild west so that's how my leaderships i've evolved

01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:45.800
[Guest]: and at some point also because i kept a certain distance um and i learned that from my mtv

01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:50.600
[Guest]: days and from my channel v days that the more distance you keep with not like being cold

01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:55.960
[Guest]: but like there needs to be a line so um i wouldn't like even when i had like my first

01:59:55.960 --> 02:00:01.560
[Guest]: assistant producer i would take care of that person like he was like almost like a kid

02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:05.480
[Guest]: i would take care of right but i would still make that the relation i was still not your

02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:10.200
[Guest]: friend in the normal sense i'm still that person you can turn to when you need help

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:15.880
[Guest]: i also became this person because of the people i learned from you know the producers i had

02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:21.520
[Guest]: back at mtv back at channel v who i learned good and bad from i learned how you should

02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:26.720
[Guest]: not be uh whenever i've seen someone try to make them the center of it it becomes a problem

02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:30.720
[Guest]: whereas you're always a facilitator i think we need a good producer and i still say i'm

02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:34.960
[Guest]: a good producer because you're a facilitator you're not the director you're not the script

02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:40.440
[Guest]: writer you're not the dop you're not the actor you have to make sure the ship runs and and

02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:45.720
[Guest]: reaches its destination so i just took that mindset of me being a producer and put it

02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:50.840
[Guest]: into me uh being an entrepreneur and that's always worked out let's move on to i think

02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:56.160
[Amit Varma]: another of sort of the big changes that we've seen in the last decade and a half you spoke

02:00:56.160 --> 02:01:02.600
[Amit Varma]: earlier of about how uh you know tech has changed so much and uh you know one realization

02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:06.800
[Amit Varma]: of this was you know i think back in 2016 these guys from the u.s got in touch with

02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:11.120
[Amit Varma]: me and said would i do a youtube series for them and would i kind of make some videos

02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:14.320
[Amit Varma]: where i'm talking about concepts for three minutes and whatever and i scripted it and

02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:18.320
[Amit Varma]: they said i will pay x amount for the production which was decent enough why don't you get

02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:23.040
[Amit Varma]: someone to produce it so i reached out to a contemporary of mine who had also done the

02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:28.680
[Amit Varma]: mtv channel v thing and you might even know him david polycarp yeah and yeah so david

02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:32.960
[Amit Varma]: is a very dear friend so david very kindly said don't worry i will take care of everything

02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:38.160
[Amit Varma]: and he got a like a 20 person crew to my house and they moved bookshelves around and hazar

02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:42.440
[Amit Varma]: production went into it and i was at that time just thinking in my head that oh okay

02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:47.720
[Amit Varma]: my imagination was that a guy will come with one camera and one lapel mic and it'll just

02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:53.160
[Amit Varma]: kind of happen and there is this massive kind of crew and uh you know recently i've also

02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:58.160
[Amit Varma]: been thinking of experimenting with youtube and all of that uh building my own setup researching

02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:03.800
[Amit Varma]: that and the thing is that it is incredibly simple like even for podcasting you know like

02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:09.880
[Amit Varma]: what i'm doing now i mean i'm basically producing my own show and i can get near studio quality

02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:15.800
[Amit Varma]: output you know with really basic budget equipment uh what 20 years ago would have you know been

02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:21.920
[Amit Varma]: a full production involving so much and probably beyond the reach of one person but today you

02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:26.920
[Amit Varma]: can sit in your room and uh you know just kind of uh get it done and this is something

02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:31.760
[Amit Varma]: that i think sort of older people perhaps of my generation haven't quite fully come

02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:36.000
[Amit Varma]: to terms with but younger creators have immediately figured it out because they are native to

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.680
[Amit Varma]: this they're consuming this stuff all the time they're much more comfortable with technology

02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:46.040
[Amit Varma]: and so on how has the transition been for you because in a sense you started off in

02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:52.280
[Amit Varma]: the old world where uh you are using all those i presume those big ass cameras and whatever

02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:56.120
[Amit Varma]: but at the same time like you mentioned you're fortunate enough to be in a place where the

02:02:56.120 --> 02:03:01.160
[Amit Varma]: workflows are not that dogmatic where you're constantly doing jugar sugar and you know

02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:06.000
[Amit Varma]: getting um doing things very fast which is very much sort of the youtube ethic in a sense

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:10.760
[Amit Varma]: just get it done get it done just keep doing throw things at the wall uh what was that

02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:16.680
[Amit Varma]: sort of process uh for you like and is that stuff that the agency is also internalized

02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:19.920
[Amit Varma]: in the work you do like you said that you pick up tips from creators and you'll pass

02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:24.560
[Amit Varma]: it along to them so you know how has that impacted your workflows for example like you

02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:28.400
[Guest]: know what's the workflow of the varun dogi show the workflow the varun dogi show is pretty

02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:32.760
[Guest]: simple actually so i go through this period of experimentation where i will in sometimes

02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:36.680
[Guest]: spend unnecessary money on on random things and eventually come with a simple solution

02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:41.960
[Guest]: so i wanted my for instance video to be slightly better than regular zoom quality so i bought

02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:47.720
[Guest]: a webcam eventually which worked great because it got me i'm like okay youtube is 1080 you

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:52.720
[Guest]: don't need a 4k camera got a webcam for 3000 rupees that took care of that so for me that

02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:56.080
[Guest]: was great took care of one entire piece because every time i went to another platform and

02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:00.720
[Guest]: i've tried many there was some problem i've always faced in the video part of it the audio

02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:07.760
[Guest]: parts have always been great so i've still stuck to using zoom in most cases but my workflow

02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:12.920
[Guest]: is pretty simple i have like i have a bunch of people i've kind of working with now um

02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:16.720
[Guest]: from this company called the small business project that rachit and his team are fabulous

02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:20.560
[Guest]: and i've known rachit for a bit and and what i've actually done with them is to kind of

02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:24.440
[Guest]: work with them and say i tell rachit okay i i'm going to give you x y and z i need to

02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:29.520
[Guest]: take care of other pieces for me and we figured a workflow and and and also kind of find people

02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:32.920
[Guest]: who you will meet right so some of the like some of the guys who work on the audio are

02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:37.440
[Guest]: like x ibm who kind of going so we're going to plug in and they're helping on that front

02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:41.240
[Guest]: find somebody else who's just reached out and said okay i'm pulling out insights from

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:45.320
[Guest]: episodes and someone wants to send me chapters right so you know you don't do timestamps

02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:49.840
[Guest]: on an episode someone was nice enough to email me saying these are the timestamps for your

02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:54.440
[Guest]: episode and i said okay do you want to do this all the time i can make it a paid gig

02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:58.880
[Guest]: so it's i think some of those things have organically evolved and if we've putting together

02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:04.480
[Guest]: a team of people who are naturally proactive and doing stuff and we're finding a flow um

02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:08.800
[Guest]: my recording style is pretty straightforward um i actually you know one of the first things

02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:13.760
[Guest]: you said is that i don't do prep prep which i always say my prep is not traditional prep

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:20.520
[Guest]: i do a 15 minute pre-chat with my guests a week before at least or whenever i can get

02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:25.800
[Guest]: a slot so in that i scribble a few things on my ipad and that is my frame of reference

02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:30.080
[Guest]: in some cases their pr teams or whoever will send me some stuff which i generally don't

02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:34.760
[Guest]: necessarily follow but i do find a few pieces there as nuggets which i find interesting

02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:39.000
[Guest]: so i put them down there and then i let it flow that because a lot of my audience also

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:43.880
[Guest]: i mean at least on advertising is dead is a lot more corporate so i get a lot more info

02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:49.480
[Guest]: there on the varunduki show for me i call it improv podcasting because i feel it's interesting

02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:54.440
[Guest]: kind of bring someone in and have a regular conversation um and let it evolve where it

02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:57.680
[Guest]: does and that's what i've been doing i've been i've been trying to find as widespread

02:05:57.680 --> 02:06:02.400
[Guest]: a set of guests as i can and just have a chat about stuff i'd want to really talk to them

02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:06.600
[Guest]: about and and what are you looking at this as being okay this is like a show that's focused

02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:11.000
[Guest]: on x and y and z it's like you learn so much from conversation so that's how i'm looking

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:15.680
[Guest]: at that uh but going back to the other part about what i've learned as as actual hacks

02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:20.160
[Guest]: and tools and creation what's been interesting is it's it's been an interesting three-way

02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:24.200
[Guest]: street where i know the people in our team as well who'll follow some of those youtube

02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:28.320
[Guest]: channels like for instance a large part of what we do is product so how do you shoot

02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:33.400
[Guest]: a product was traditionally very complex but still is complex process just to make it look

02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:38.120
[Guest]: the way you know you some of those things you need that texture you need you know those

02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:42.880
[Guest]: all of that stuff and that's a very complicated process it's very expensive to do but there's

02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:47.760
[Guest]: so many of these youtubers who have these hacks so i for instance follow a few of them

02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:50.600
[Guest]: and i keep sending those videos we have a few of those groups between people in the

02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:55.520
[Guest]: office right on one on instagram one on whatsapp and we'll all keep sending stuff across and

02:06:55.520 --> 02:07:00.760
[Guest]: and those range from someone's television commercial to someone's behind the scenes

02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:06.200
[Guest]: video of a youtube product shoot and and somewhere in between we've found things we will adopt

02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:12.920
[Guest]: so we do a lot of product stuff that looks instagram worthy might not be at the same

02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:18.960
[Guest]: high endness of what is traditionally a product shot for an ad but it's great for instagram

02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:24.000
[Guest]: it's great for e-commerce so also makes it seem like it's content which you normally

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:29.960
[Guest]: scroll past so we build that out and a lot of the techniques we use to create that is

02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:34.880
[Guest]: what youtubers use and so i love when that happens right and when that's happening and

02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:38.920
[Guest]: when someone reaches out simply you use something right what do you use as equipment so i think

02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:43.680
[Guest]: this is what it is so there's times when i've actually sent across stuff which i have bought

02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:48.200
[Guest]: as random small equipment and said try and use this so i remember when we were doing

02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:53.480
[Guest]: stuff at fashion week or like me you know there's a thing where you need to switch your

02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:58.760
[Guest]: mindset where you would shoot something on a larger camera move it to an edit machine

02:07:58.760 --> 02:08:04.040
[Guest]: edit it and upload it online when it had to be as live as possible we started shooting

02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:09.040
[Guest]: on an iphone so every year the glitch office would have a brand new set of iphones come

02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:13.320
[Guest]: in and the old set sold off best investment ever because through the year whenever you

02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:18.840
[Guest]: had to go to smaller events etc these phones have fabulous cameras i shoot so i'm starting

02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:25.320
[Guest]: to work on a few vlog like or straight up content like pieces for youtube i had a gopro

02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:29.960
[Guest]: i tried to use some other camera i eventually came down to using my iphone i'm like once

02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:35.440
[Guest]: this is a great camera figured a way to you know get the right kind of tripod and i use

02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:42.080
[Guest]: like i bought a light and all that stuff but a lot of these techniques when i look at how

02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:46.960
[Guest]: people are shooting like when you mentioned the crew kind of coming in 20 people now those

02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:52.560
[Guest]: shoots and also thanks to how shoots happened last year have become that tiny you literally

02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:57.880
[Guest]: have two people come in i had to shoot something for a workshop piece i was doing one guy came

02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:03.120
[Guest]: with one camera put the mic in and and had no light because he said can we just shoot

02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:08.740
[Guest]: in the day so i feel like finally come into that point of getting as many people as required

02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:14.320
[Guest]: in india we have too many people on a set it's a problem we great in giving employment

02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:18.120
[Guest]: it's a it's fabulous right you will have one guy walking around giving people bislerika

02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:23.800
[Guest]: uh bottles to drink water on a set right traditionally you go abroad someone goes and takes their

02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:28.760
[Guest]: own water they'll have a guy to pick up two boxes you'll have one more guy so for everything

02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:33.700
[Guest]: there is somebody's job which is which is great in a larger context but also makes it

02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:39.120
[Guest]: a very crowded space and makes it very noisy whereas like and i think we finally come to

02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:43.200
[Guest]: that point it's i mean obviously we have to figure how all those people are going to survive

02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:46.600
[Guest]: what they're going to do and and they've all and some of those things have gone back to

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:51.960
[Guest]: normal right shoots in many of those cases still happen the same but we finally realizing

02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:56.080
[Guest]: especially from youtubers that this stuff can be shot this way you don't necessarily

02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:00.920
[Guest]: need 50 people for everything you can do it with five people it's just that we never tried

02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:05.920
[Guest]: to do it because we thought it's simpler and more relaxed to have one person to do every

02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:12.420
[Guest]: single thing and and that nuance is fabulous now and most creators like i don't know want

02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:16.640
[Guest]: all this just give me a phone and i'll go shoot that the way they shoot is interesting

02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:20.960
[Guest]: i've learned so much from that they believe in archiving which is fabulous because they'll

02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:25.320
[Guest]: see something random they'll shoot it they'll store it in their phone and they'll use it

02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:29.920
[Guest]: at a later date it's just there in their stock of videos which we would never think of as

02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:35.400
[Amit Varma]: stock footage yeah i mean you get into the habit of you should be roll all the time and

02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:40.680
[Amit Varma]: you never know when you kind of might use it so tell me about you know you're so beginning

02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:45.200
[Amit Varma]: to explore the creator ecosystem like first of all you know when do you start thinking

02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:50.240
[Amit Varma]: of yourself as a creator in this sense is it when you start doing advertising is dead

02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:56.500
[Amit Varma]: or is it some way kind of into that you know on your newsletter as well you shared plenty

02:10:56.500 --> 02:11:02.120
[Amit Varma]: of insights about sort of the creator ecosystem you've spoken about how do you build frameworks

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:06.640
[Amit Varma]: you've spoken about what you call the intimate content ecosystem take me through a you know

02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:10.960
[Amit Varma]: your personal narrative of how you begin to think of yourself as a creator and then about

02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:17.140
[Amit Varma]: how you begin to set up those processes by which you kind of create and how that conception

02:11:17.140 --> 02:11:21.000
[Amit Varma]: of yourself is evolving to begin with before we actually get down to what the ecosystem

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:26.400
[Guest]: is like so i think i truly became a creator in my head while i've always dabbled in these

02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:31.560
[Guest]: things since i started the podcast i think by the time i hit like 75 80 episodes of advertising

02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:35.320
[Guest]: is dead i'm like once again this is actually a thing right because i think for the first

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.760
[Guest]: 50 i was still figuring out what i was like i it a took me a while to even think about

02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:45.080
[Guest]: the fact that i was a podcast host because i used to always mumble as a kid and through

02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:49.280
[Guest]: college so i was never clear like i would be in meetings and i'd be told talk slower

02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:54.040
[Guest]: people aren't getting what you're saying and to go from that to me doing this as like almost

02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:58.960
[Guest]: something which i do almost as half my job and i'd say that in the nicest way possible

02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:04.800
[Guest]: and it has been an interesting transition for my own headspace and i feel that i've

02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:10.840
[Guest]: become a lot more confident about the things i'll be able to do i've always had confidence

02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:15.720
[Guest]: it's grown over the years since my days in bangalore and everything else but i've truly

02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:22.240
[Guest]: been able to okay i can actually do this happened around 75 episodes around 50 i was happy around

02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:26.880
[Guest]: 75 like on what next so i remember that when if when i finished 50 episodes i made this

02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:31.720
[Guest]: note down saying notes post 50 and i one of the things okay what are the things i need

02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:36.000
[Guest]: to now work on because till then it was about let's get the show in that's when i really

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.480
[Guest]: start look at my programming a lot more you know but how do i make the variance of my

02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:45.920
[Guest]: guests interesting how do i look at what's happening around the show in that sense one

02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:49.680
[Guest]: day someone told me that why is your instagram account so boring i'm like what do you mean

02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:56.160
[Guest]: i say if you go to it all you see are teal and yellow posts because i wasn't posting

02:12:56.160 --> 02:13:01.560
[Guest]: anything except for the episode creative every week i said people want more from you around

02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:05.920
[Guest]: the show i'm like it seems like a lot of work and so i tried and i would then i started

02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:09.680
[Guest]: sharing random stuff it wasn't there was no plan something i'd find interesting i would

02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:15.320
[Guest]: share i was still not i think i became a creator fully in full fledgedness at when lockdown

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:19.920
[Guest]: happened because i was suddenly at home i had bought a mic because i wanted to dabble

02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:23.880
[Guest]: in recording some stuff myself and also because i said sometimes you might need some patchwork

02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:28.280
[Guest]: i didn't want to travel all the way back to the ibm studio to do it um let me just buy

02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:34.840
[Guest]: a mic so i bought a usb mic and it was there and when i started to create this i started

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:39.840
[Guest]: enjoying all the smaller pieces right because sometimes when you're in a studio you you

02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:44.320
[Guest]: miss all the other stuff you could do around it and you and i think the first couple of

02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:48.600
[Guest]: months of lockdown is because there wasn't much you could do work also wasn't as hectic

02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:53.080
[Guest]: for a lot of us because there was not as much happening on many fronts so that's when useless

02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:57.000
[Guest]: information happened because i want to just not just talk about advertising and marketing

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:02.200
[Guest]: right now the world's in this space i want to talk about something that is utterly random

02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:06.240
[Guest]: which is why useless happened i was like this is going to be the like you need to have that

02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:11.760
[Guest]: one hour of irreverence of any random conversation and this is what that show is and the more

02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:16.680
[Guest]: i did it then i started looking at how other people post um i started looking at how to

02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:21.400
[Guest]: create and slowly but surely i started enjoying many elements of it i also realized it doesn't

02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:27.640
[Guest]: have to be that complicated i feel that that baggage you take from having short stuff and

02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:33.040
[Guest]: create stuff with all that stuff around makes you not want to do it whereas i feel that

02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:37.440
[Guest]: that's what the difference between generations is that people now were born with a phone

02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:42.880
[Guest]: which they could create with whereas when cell phones came into our lives a little later

02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:47.960
[Guest]: in life right and and and then the cameras and everything else so i discovered that in

02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:52.400
[Guest]: 2020 i think 2019 i was still dabbling and and i wasn't committing to it i've had friends

02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:57.880
[Guest]: who in the space said okay why don't you do more with this um and that you need to decide

02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:02.280
[Guest]: if this is a hobby or if this is something you're doing seriously even me being a podcast

02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:06.360
[Guest]: host right so i said sometime you're giving so much time and effort and money uh money

02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:10.680
[Guest]: as being just like the time i spend on it is it going somewhere or just doing it for

02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:15.680
[Guest]: fun so decide that and plan it that way and i have a few of these friends who will always

02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:20.380
[Guest]: put these points in my ear and whenever i'm just because i tend to get into a flow enjoy

02:15:20.380 --> 02:15:24.520
[Guest]: the flow and not to think about how this could be in the future and i have a few of them

02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:28.720
[Guest]: including puja who will sit me down and say think about why you're doing this and think

02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:35.320
[Guest]: about and put that down and then move with that and that's what i've been doing but uh

02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:41.200
[Guest]: yeah i'm just enjoying sharing more and more i found new formats i've um instagram was

02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:45.380
[Guest]: something i started to do a lot more in 2020 then i started looking at the kind of content

02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:51.880
[Guest]: i want to share so i start sharing stuff about books because um i've been terrible at remembering

02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:57.240
[Guest]: pieces of books um i find it fascinating that you remember so many of these things but i

02:15:57.240 --> 02:16:03.200
[Guest]: sometimes i don't remember anything so i found an app called readvise and readvise has been

02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:07.760
[Guest]: fabulous for me because everything i would bookmark on my kindle would show up there

02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:11.080
[Guest]: and i'm like and i'd keep going back to it give me like a few things every day or something

02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:16.000
[Guest]: i bookmarked or something which i marked up and so i started just sharing that and that

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.480
[Guest]: started to be something people really enjoyed my workout videos have were a random thing

02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:24.600
[Guest]: i just started to do because it's a large part of how i've been able to push i need

02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:29.280
[Guest]: to find that one piece to anchor my day which gives me like it's my form of meditation right

02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:34.160
[Guest]: that one what 45 minutes to one hour i work out every day and i work out every single

02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:39.120
[Guest]: day i took a week off started again uh when we're recording this and it's been one of

02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:42.160
[Guest]: those things so i just started to share a bunch of these things gone back to my love

02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:48.880
[Guest]: for formats so trying a live format try twitter spaces out try a newsletter all of these things

02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:53.240
[Guest]: have come from single well let's just try this out maybe i'll enjoy doing it and and

02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:56.840
[Guest]: also some from time to time pull back as well pull back and say okay you're doing too much

02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:02.120
[Guest]: now think about all the stuff you want to do and don't want to do and um and i and recalibrate

02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:06.200
[Guest]: as well i'm gonna come back so that's been my creative journey it's been about what do

02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:11.400
[Guest]: i want to share with the world which i feel they'll get some value from which i also enjoy

02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:17.120
[Guest]: doing while i'm sharing it um and i'm realized i have a lot of those and i still have many

02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:21.800
[Guest]: more which i still want to work on and share um and so that's what's keeping me going as

02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:27.520
[Amit Varma]: in this whole creator mindset of mine so i'm kind of going to ramble a bit uh and also

02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:31.480
[Amit Varma]: give my gentle disagreement with something you said in one of your posts but first a

02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:37.640
[Amit Varma]: ramble which is that you know when i was teaching a podcasting course and and people would ask

02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:41.040
[Amit Varma]: you know what should i make a podcast about or where are the gaps in the market and blah

02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:45.160
[Amit Varma]: blah blah and i would always say that listen you know everything's been done every idea

02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:49.640
[Amit Varma]: is out there every format is out there there's nothing new even if you find a gap in the

02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:53.600
[Amit Varma]: market 50 other people will the only thing that makes your show unique is you so you

02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:59.760
[Amit Varma]: have to be authentic to yourself and in a sense that's also how i defined uh the scene

02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:04.640
[Amit Varma]: in the unseen is that this is a show that is documenting my intellectual curiosity i

02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:09.680
[Amit Varma]: speak i have conversations with people i want to have conversations with and like you correctly

02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:14.000
[Amit Varma]: said you know you have something to learn from everybody every single person on this

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:18.240
[Amit Varma]: planet knows something that you don't so if you have the opportunity to have a conversation

02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:22.960
[Amit Varma]: and learn some of that that's incredible now as you were speaking it struck me that you

02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:27.480
[Amit Varma]: know everything else that you're doing whether it is sharing the things that you found interesting

02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:33.120
[Amit Varma]: in the books you read or whether it is your workout videos and so on also feeds into that

02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:38.680
[Amit Varma]: same thing it feeds into authenticity and who you are which is what will ultimately

02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:42.900
[Amit Varma]: uh draw someone you know tomorrow if i announced that hey the scene in the unseen i'm taking

02:18:42.900 --> 02:18:47.320
[Amit Varma]: a break someone else will do the interviews it's not the same show anymore it's completely

02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:52.640
[Amit Varma]: different right and ditto with advertising is dead or in fact any good show done by anybody

02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:58.760
[Amit Varma]: uh in fact one of my editors who have shared with ivm uh till now was one day telling me

02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:02.160
[Amit Varma]: how it's fascinating to him that the same guest will come on my show and your show and

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:07.120
[Amit Varma]: say kartik show and it'll be a completely different conversation which is one of the

02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:11.680
[Amit Varma]: delights of it and the gentle disagreement is because i think at some point you were

02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:15.920
[Amit Varma]: speaking about what you should keep in mind when you're starting a podcast and i think

02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:20.120
[Amit Varma]: the second of your questions if i remember correctly was why you you know what do you

02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:25.400
[Amit Varma]: have that is special that is whatever and i think in a sense that is the wrong question

02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:32.360
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that one everyone is a sort of you know unique in the way and secondly even

02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:37.320
[Amit Varma]: if you're not an expert in something the point is that you are on a journey which many other

02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:42.720
[Amit Varma]: people are on at different stages perhaps so there is value in your sharing that part

02:19:42.720 --> 02:19:48.040
[Amit Varma]: of it anymore so someone who is for example watching one of your workout videos uh might

02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:52.240
[Amit Varma]: aspire to work out like that might be a person who works out himself and is looking at hey

02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:56.640
[Amit Varma]: how someone else does it a fellow traveler does it so to say i would imagine that people

02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:01.200
[Amit Varma]: who listen to our respective podcasts have thought about many of these things are interested

02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:06.080
[Amit Varma]: in some of these things it doesn't matter if we per se as hosts are not special it is

02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:12.120
[Amit Varma]: our you know sort of journey that we uh share and to that extent it seems that a lot of

02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:18.260
[Amit Varma]: what makes creators stand out is that element of being true to themselves like when blogs

02:20:18.260 --> 02:20:22.840
[Amit Varma]: came about people used to disparagingly say of blogs that hey who wants to know what you

02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:28.280
[Amit Varma]: had for breakfast and i'm like no actually you know in a sense many people want to know

02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:34.640
[Amit Varma]: what you had for breakfast what are your sort of thoughts on this so i want to clarify that

02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:42.080
[Guest]: the point you disagree on right is that so why i said that why you is because if you

02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:47.120
[Guest]: are not convinced as to why are you the person to do this you will not stick on to this for

02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:51.200
[Guest]: too long right because i feel a lot of people start a podcast saying oh i want to do it

02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:55.840
[Guest]: because somebody else is doing it or somebody else is doing this um that authentic part

02:20:55.840 --> 02:20:59.640
[Guest]: you spoke about is exactly the reasoning and i agree because it's a journey right like

02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:04.040
[Guest]: i do this 25 episode thing every 25 episode sit down and say why am i doing this like

02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:08.720
[Guest]: i revisit that saying why am i that which is why at some point i said okay i can't only

02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:11.960
[Guest]: talk advertising and marketing let me talk about business as well for advertising is

02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:15.840
[Guest]: dead the varun dooky show happened because i'm interested in personal development i'm

02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:22.120
[Guest]: interested in in workflows and everything else and and productivity as such and so all

02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:27.480
[Guest]: of that is how that happened but what i feel is interesting about the guests and the voice

02:21:27.480 --> 02:21:33.560
[Guest]: is that i agree with you podcast for me the biggest revelation has been is that it's such

02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:39.880
[Guest]: a simple medium in that its voice and its conversation it is the kind which we do but

02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:46.760
[Guest]: it's also so liberating because you're not constrained by studio set lights which is

02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:51.480
[Guest]: what a lot of us get constrained by in video which i know that youtubers and real makers

02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:56.640
[Guest]: will disagree with me because they don't necessarily have any constraints as well but i feel it's

02:21:56.640 --> 02:22:02.760
[Guest]: a medium where you can actually go deeper into things and really get insights as you

02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:08.440
[Guest]: personally want to get out and people will find insights from that and what's also kind

02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:14.640
[Guest]: of interesting is that i've had my own journey in the way i speak on the podcast over the

02:22:14.640 --> 02:22:20.360
[Guest]: last two and a half years because i feel that i've evolved i've evolved my learning i've

02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:24.000
[Guest]: evolved with the kind of guests i want to bring on kind of conversations i want to have

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:29.160
[Guest]: because also at some point i agree with you that people come in for the host a lot more

02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:35.000
[Guest]: than the guests because they want the host's way of having a conversation the way of digging

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:39.880
[Guest]: into what the matter of that episode is subject matter of the episode is is what interests

02:22:39.880 --> 02:22:43.760
[Guest]: them because they relate to that right it's like so i speak to some people about some

02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:48.040
[Guest]: of the most popular podcasts globally right there are many people who don't like masters

02:22:48.040 --> 02:22:52.960
[Guest]: of scale i kind of agree with them in some context because i find reid hoffman to be

02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:58.320
[Guest]: great in some conversations not so great in many i feel he uses sound design to cover

02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:04.440
[Guest]: up for for many of his own issues maybe in the way he does it similarly for i remember

02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:10.440
[Guest]: listening to this podcast called inside voices which has been my find of last year and inside

02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:16.600
[Guest]: voices was a podcast where the conversations are only with podcast hosts i forget the name

02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:21.760
[Guest]: of the host or the podcast but he says that what does your voice sound like and i found

02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:25.480
[Guest]: that to be such an interesting question because it has two and he takes it in both the angles

02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:29.240
[Guest]: that what do you think it sounds like yet what does it really stand for in terms of

02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:33.560
[Guest]: what it sounds like and he takes both those contexts and i found it and that podcast for

02:23:33.560 --> 02:23:39.400
[Guest]: me made me think so much about who i am and what my own voice was and that's actually

02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:44.320
[Guest]: when i built this framework out of of thinking about how to make a podcast and and i realized

02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:49.000
[Guest]: that frameworks were a thing as the deeper i went into the productivity youtube rabbit

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:55.520
[Guest]: hole but i mean that that podcast taught me a lot i i remember went back to some there's

02:23:55.520 --> 02:24:02.120
[Guest]: a podcast host called mad golly mad golly does what eight podcasts and last count which

02:24:02.120 --> 02:24:07.520
[Guest]: i've i've seen and i was like how does someone do eight podcasts right i think even he's

02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:12.520
[Guest]: also on conan's podcast if i remember right i'm not sure entirely and so his thing was

02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:16.000
[Guest]: interesting right because his thing was the curiosity of the different realms he has of

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:21.040
[Guest]: interest and how he works on it was intriguing to me so there is so much there to unpack

02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:24.560
[Guest]: that at some point you're kind of sitting and you're learning and you're reveling in

02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:29.680
[Guest]: it and you're letting it flow you're hoping people are along for the ride and you're hoping

02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:33.760
[Guest]: that they learn something from it and you'll also very easily know people don't like it

02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:37.360
[Guest]: i mean i've once in a while and i've tried something slightly different someone will

02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:40.920
[Guest]: write in and say okay i didn't like this and you learn from that not necessarily follow

02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:47.160
[Amit Varma]: it but you'll also learn from it fascinating and tell me about frameworks now like you

02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:51.960
[Amit Varma]: know in your newsletter in the november 7th edition to be precise you spoke about three

02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:57.600
[Amit Varma]: ways to build a framework which i found very relatable because that's almost exactly what

02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:02.840
[Amit Varma]: i try to do not necessarily what i do always and i feel that you know building a framework

02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:08.160
[Amit Varma]: around something that you're doing helps in two ways one it helps clarify exactly what

02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:12.640
[Amit Varma]: you're doing and sometimes why and two then it makes the process much easier then it's

02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:16.960
[Amit Varma]: not a mishmash of stuff that you have to somehow get through there's just an easy way you're

02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:20.760
[Amit Varma]: sitting down and you're kind of getting the job done it takes those sort of mechanical

02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:24.680
[Amit Varma]: elements out of the way tell me a bit about how you're thinking of frameworks evolved

02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:31.840
[Amit Varma]: and how you developed your own workflows and and what are these three ways so i actually

02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:35.720
[Guest]: got into frameworks very recently i never knew the term framework was the right term

02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:41.200
[Guest]: to use for a lot of stuff so sometimes when someone would ask me to plan something i think

02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:46.040
[Guest]: formats were my version of frameworks i know that that's a term i've used a lot through

02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:50.720
[Guest]: this episode um and and at some point when i would do any form of work i try to come

02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:57.080
[Guest]: with my own system to do it my own reasoning as to why it has to be a certain way um and

02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:02.640
[Guest]: there are few youtubers who have actually learned a bunch of stuff um casey neistat

02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:07.520
[Guest]: has been one of my long-time like favorites for just like the process of what he did but

02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:12.680
[Guest]: i knew that i love his episodes where he he draws stuff out with the marker on paper to

02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:17.920
[Guest]: show how stuff happens i discovered matt diavola at some point and made a well as deep into

02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:23.640
[Guest]: productivity and and everything else and very like again i learned some there is one youtuber

02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:31.480
[Guest]: who um his name is nathaniel drew and i discovered him sometime i think uh late 2019 and i found

02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:38.760
[Guest]: his story fascinating the young guy uh from i forget where in america who's who's learns

02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:43.720
[Guest]: languages who travels the world and the way he even shoots the way he narrates is so classical

02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:50.120
[Guest]: but he goes back into um he builds out frameworks for his own life and just like talks about

02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:55.600
[Guest]: that so at some point as i start putting those down and i came up and i came across the term

02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:00.520
[Guest]: framework i saw okay one second there are things you do in life and i feel that the

02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:06.440
[Guest]: reason why the only way you can do more in your day and yet be healthy get enough rest

02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:10.720
[Guest]: etc is if you build routine into your life i think routine is the framework for life

02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:16.000
[Guest]: so for me my process in the morning in many ways is templatized like it's it's a standard

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:21.000
[Guest]: flow i will i will do x y and z right after each other and that's my framework for my

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:26.240
[Guest]: morning very rarely gets altered unless i'm traveling or something else is up um and i

02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:30.840
[Guest]: feel that as you build those things out you then can bring them into every single thing

02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:36.520
[Guest]: every single thing you do can be brought down to a framework because every framework is

02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:42.000
[Guest]: also adaptable it's not rigid in my mind it is fluid and that's how i came across it and

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:47.080
[Guest]: then i started reading more and more about frameworks and trying to see what people have

02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:51.840
[Guest]: used and i get more ideas from that right so i sometimes try to adapt a framework sometimes

02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:55.960
[Guest]: i try to use literally sometimes i try to come up with one in many cases what i come

02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:59.800
[Guest]: up with so my newsletter sometimes i experiment some of the frameworks i have put across which

02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:05.720
[Guest]: i have come up with are experiments or frameworks i came up with while i was writing that newsletter

02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:08.720
[Guest]: it's not like i've thought about before when i'm thinking about a certain topic i'm like

02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:14.120
[Guest]: what could the structure for this be what could the format for this be and i came up

02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:18.840
[Guest]: with it and i put it down i have also had some very badly written frameworks which when

02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:24.520
[Guest]: i read it after i write it i'm like this doesn't work so i'll scrap it and i'll write something

02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:31.600
[Guest]: else but that's i think i think i love that but it's that i think that love for formats

02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:37.200
[Guest]: has now come into this and it's just made me think about like the other day i was talking

02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:44.600
[Guest]: to a friend of mine name is munjal kapadia right he also does a podcast he's also our

02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:51.400
[Guest]: doc we had leah with him and i was like is there a framework for being a dad and because

02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:56.920
[Guest]: he and i talk a lot about being fathers because i think we we are modern fathers of this generation

02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:02.600
[Guest]: are so different from how dads were like my dad was a certain way he and i have a fabulous

02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:09.360
[Guest]: relationship but i think that a lot of what is part of my role as a father involves being

02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:15.560
[Guest]: a lot more hands-on than it ever was for anybody before me and and i enjoy so much of that

02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:20.160
[Guest]: right um and so i said is there a framework for that and because i feel that everything

02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:24.400
[Guest]: in life can be drilled down to a framework but that framework might not necessarily work

02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:29.520
[Guest]: for everyone it could work for some not work for the others and the more i put it down

02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:33.440
[Guest]: at least in my head for a person who's so unstructured it helps me bring some sort of

02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:37.800
[Guest]: structure into my own mind and i feel that's why frameworks are important especially for

02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:43.520
[Amit Varma]: unstructured to kind of keep putting down so is there a framework for being a dad what's

02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:48.640
[Guest]: your framework my framework for being a dad is a few things um i don't i haven't put it

02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:58.280
[Guest]: on paper but i feel that to be a dad you need to be the balance of a person who has enough

02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:03.680
[Guest]: time and a set of interests so i fell over the quadrant right with me and leah there

02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:08.600
[Guest]: are things which only she and i do together so it's that one part that's only her and

02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:14.060
[Guest]: my thing to do um and there'll be small things for the longest time it was me just taking

02:30:14.060 --> 02:30:19.560
[Guest]: her to the loo when she had to do number two right it was our thing that dad takes me that

02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:25.160
[Guest]: papa takes me to do that like mom doesn't take honey doesn't take um unless i was in

02:30:25.160 --> 02:30:29.720
[Guest]: a meeting or whatever or it could be the fact that there's this book i read for very often

02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:33.800
[Guest]: of recent times i'm trying to get her into star wars because she is named leah and it's

02:30:33.800 --> 02:30:39.360
[Guest]: very little princess but how i read it is that i don't read it literally we look at

02:30:39.360 --> 02:30:43.720
[Guest]: what's happening in each page and i come up with stories i want to teach her how to imagine

02:30:43.720 --> 02:30:49.320
[Guest]: it being having an imagination has helped me through life in boring classrooms in boring

02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:54.120
[Guest]: meetings in at times when i was just generally bored or didn't have anything to do or just

02:30:54.120 --> 02:30:58.560
[Guest]: kind of imagine what life could be like um find your happy place and things like that

02:30:58.560 --> 02:31:03.520
[Guest]: so so some of those things are stuff that she and i do together i'm also the person

02:31:03.520 --> 02:31:11.360
[Guest]: who who in her life will be the most i think strict is a bad word but she knows that when

02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:16.480
[Guest]: i call something as a line i give her a reason and i and she she knows that i will not flinch

02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:21.560
[Guest]: from that if i if with that reason right so everybody's surprised that i would be the

02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:27.080
[Guest]: strictest person with her because i'm not that person at all in with anybody else um

02:31:27.080 --> 02:31:31.800
[Guest]: but i feel that you need to have one there's a line between being a parent and being a

02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:36.520
[Guest]: friend i don't necessarily want to need to be her friend but i need to be her parent

02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:41.240
[Guest]: and i feel that that's a distinction so while the stuff we do together there is stuff which

02:31:41.240 --> 02:31:47.520
[Guest]: are things that she knows i will have a say on and then beyond that is the fact that i'll

02:31:47.520 --> 02:31:52.880
[Guest]: always have time for her for stuff that's important for her so she has a twice a week

02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:57.280
[Guest]: skating class so i'm making this up while i'm talking to you but if i had to put on

02:31:57.280 --> 02:32:02.840
[Guest]: this i feel that as dads you miss a lot of things in the past when i look at for many

02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:07.360
[Guest]: people's fathers my my my dad had had to miss stuff because he's a doctor i have a case

02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:12.000
[Guest]: you can't come uh if it's sports day and then stuff i understand all of those things but

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:16.160
[Guest]: for me it's very important that there's some things that are part of leia's life which

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:21.400
[Guest]: i know really important to her which if i am not a part of that's me not doing what

02:32:21.400 --> 02:32:26.600
[Guest]: i have to do as a father so stuff that we do together stuff that's important to her

02:32:26.600 --> 02:32:30.120
[Guest]: and then stuff that's important to me rather which is what the stuff i'm strict on saying

02:32:30.120 --> 02:32:35.120
[Guest]: okay you need to like i want her to learn to take her own shoes and put them in the

02:32:35.120 --> 02:32:40.680
[Guest]: shoe rack not leave them around it's a small thing but i think it teaches you to keep things

02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:46.960
[Guest]: in their own place and keep them organized or rather keep them how do i put it i have

02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:51.560
[Guest]: a thing about not letting things get spoiled because you don't take care of them like i

02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:55.480
[Guest]: still have a lot of my toys from when i was a kid because i took care of them um they're

02:32:55.480 --> 02:32:58.560
[Guest]: now with her and i'm trying to make sure she doesn't spoil them so some of those gijos

02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:03.920
[Guest]: have landed up with her now and so i said that it's it's the triangle of those three

02:33:03.920 --> 02:33:09.000
[Guest]: things is what being a dad is and and you're just around for the ride i feel that fathers

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:15.340
[Guest]: and daughters and fathers and uh and their kids have a very interesting relationship

02:33:15.340 --> 02:33:19.400
[Guest]: but it doesn't have to be a disjointed relationship and i don't have a disjointed one with my

02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:24.840
[Amit Varma]: father and i don't want her to have one with us how much does conscious thinking about

02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:31.360
[Amit Varma]: frameworks affect whatever the framework is a framework of for example uh you know in

02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:35.920
[Amit Varma]: that episode of advertising is dead with puja she speaks about how you guys have a relationship

02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:41.360
[Amit Varma]: which is almost not like a conventional couple you look at it more as a partnership and uh

02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:44.640
[Amit Varma]: you know obviously you're very good friends and all of that and i think you also spoke

02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:48.280
[Amit Varma]: in that or one of you spoke in that about how in the early parts of the marriage it

02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:54.960
[Amit Varma]: was a kind of most standard and then it evolved to becoming this so do you think that at and

02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:59.720
[Amit Varma]: we all all our relationships are kind of in a sense driven by inertia that it falls into

02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:04.280
[Amit Varma]: a particular groove and then it stays in that groove unless it is forced out of that group

02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:09.600
[Amit Varma]: by an external event so do you think there is something to be gained from all of us in

02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:14.560
[Amit Varma]: just sitting back and reconsidering the things that we take for granted and the grooves that

02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:19.720
[Amit Varma]: are running and thinking of what is the framework here and is that the right framework what

02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:25.360
[Amit Varma]: should be the framework here because a change in framework it seems to me can be profound

02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:30.640
[Amit Varma]: it can affect you know not just both people but everyone around them like a very charming

02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:36.200
[Amit Varma]: picture of your daughter that i saw on puja's instagram page was where she's cooking something

02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:40.400
[Amit Varma]: and she's sitting on the platform itself and she's making some bread and cheese or whatever

02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:45.600
[Amit Varma]: and a lovely photograph of course but it also strikes me that you know almost sort of a

02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:49.920
[Amit Varma]: symbolic image of what you'd expect a young girl to be when both her parents are strong

02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:55.240
[Amit Varma]: independent professionals and you know relate to each other with a certain kind of respect

02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:59.040
[Amit Varma]: and not you know which many frameworks of traditional indian marriages actually don't

02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:02.640
[Amit Varma]: have even within privileged households so do you think there is something to be said

02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:08.080
[Amit Varma]: about figuring out the framework for everything that one does i feel it's all about balance

02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:14.680
[Guest]: right it's about so what uja and i found over the years that we've been married is that

02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:19.240
[Guest]: there are certain things that are important to me certain things important to her and

02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:23.120
[Guest]: there's something which bother each of us about each other and in the same way it goes

02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:27.640
[Guest]: it goes with layer it goes with anything else and and there are some things you can work

02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:31.760
[Guest]: on some things you can't it could be as simple as i'm a person who when he's sitting keeps

02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:35.840
[Guest]: shaking his leg i have that i have that nervous tick of you know that person who shakes his

02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:41.520
[Guest]: leg it irritates the hell out of puja i have still not been able to do sort that out in

02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:46.120
[Guest]: all the years we married it's been over like what eight odd years that we've been married

02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:52.040
[Guest]: but i know for a fact that she knows that i i like my things a certain way so for me

02:35:52.040 --> 02:35:57.920
[Guest]: my morning time when i brew my coffee and i go do my business are very important my

02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:04.320
[Guest]: my my mood for the day gravitates around me doing my business in the morning and i feel

02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:10.440
[Guest]: that's i'm putting it as nicely and less graphic as possible um whereas puja likes the house

02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:15.680
[Guest]: arranged in a way that it's lovely to look at and so when i before i go to bed i make

02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:21.280
[Guest]: sure stuff is put in its place it's my thing to do um i would not have done that before

02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:25.120
[Guest]: we were married i would just leave things as they are but i know it's important to her

02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:30.040
[Guest]: and i don't mind doing it i i i'm a person who enjoys washing dishes i find it it lets

02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:35.600
[Guest]: me zone out of the world and it's weirdly therapeutic in some cases so early lockdown

02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:40.680
[Guest]: was not a problem so the way i look at it but i think you find those pieces and the

02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:44.440
[Guest]: more you find those pieces you also then figure out what those grooves are that you spoke

02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:49.680
[Guest]: of right sometimes you find something you know neither of you will want to budge from

02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:53.640
[Guest]: and then you need to have that conversation to find that new groove that kind of comes

02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:58.160
[Guest]: in because and that's what early periods of any relationship are that you're trying to

02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:03.720
[Guest]: find those what are the non-negotiables what are the negotiables and the non-negotiables

02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:08.200
[Guest]: i feel in most cases you either come to terms with but if you don't that's just going to

02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:15.040
[Guest]: be stuff that sticks for a long time and create issues we've luckily found very few non-negotiables

02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:20.960
[Guest]: um where one of us is going to come to terms with it um and i think that's how you evolve

02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:26.480
[Guest]: it so it is in a way a framework but i feel it's something that also evolves with how

02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:32.400
[Guest]: we evolve as people like when i met puja and she made me i feel we were also very different

02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:37.640
[Guest]: people than we are now eight years later we were both grown so it's still an evolving

02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:44.160
[Guest]: piece what could be like i was not as ambitious a person as i am now when she met me even

02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:48.200
[Guest]: though i was an entrepreneur and i had glitch going on and everything else i'm a lot more

02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:52.280
[Guest]: ambitious now because i suddenly see there's so much more i could do with what i've been

02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:59.120
[Guest]: able to build and do in life um and and similarly for when i look at her i've always seen puja

02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:04.600
[Guest]: as uh as a certain way with her career but i'm seeing the stuff she's doing just like

02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:10.280
[Guest]: beyond the workplace and the stuff she's focused on from a purpose standpoint etc which were

02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:14.920
[Guest]: always there but i feel that she's found that voice so i feel that we evolve as people so

02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:21.240
[Guest]: you evolve those grooves and those frameworks as well but it's also it's conversation um

02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:27.280
[Guest]: it's important in any relationship to not let and i believe that the biggest the biggest

02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:31.160
[Guest]: problems in the world can be solved by a conversation and i feel that we don't have conversations

02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:35.200
[Guest]: where you're trying to listen to the other person i think conversations are a lot people

02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:38.440
[Guest]: think it's a lot more about speaking i think as a podcast host you realize it's a lot more

02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:43.920
[Guest]: about listening um than it is about speaking and and i feel that we don't listen enough

02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:49.520
[Guest]: but in any relation as long as you listen enough you find some nuance to what the other

02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:54.040
[Guest]: person's point of view is and you work around it and as long as you do that you'll figure

02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:58.640
[Guest]: a way to evolve it into and to make it work well like you correctly said you know one

02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:01.800
[Amit Varma]: of the things you learn as a podcaster if you're paying attention is how much you need

02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:06.680
[Amit Varma]: to listen like you know steven covey once said that we don't listen to uh understand

02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:10.960
[Amit Varma]: we listen to respond which is a really bad habit that you actually and and i think you

02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:14.200
[Amit Varma]: know and this is something i discussed with the great podcaster russ roberts when he was

02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:21.160
[Amit Varma]: on my show is about how there is actually a moral component to having a good conversation

02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:26.000
[Amit Varma]: and to actually listening like you know emmanuel kahn famously spoke of the categorical imperative

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:30.320
[Amit Varma]: that you don't want to treat you know another human being as a means to an end but as an

02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:35.000
[Amit Varma]: end in themselves and very often when we are in conversation we are doing exactly that

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.920
[Amit Varma]: we are treating other people as a means to an end either we want to show off how smart

02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:45.280
[Amit Varma]: we are so you'll find you know hosts interrupting all the time and you know just to do one-upmanship

02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:50.520
[Amit Varma]: or looking for gotcha moments and all of that which is horrible and i think that once as

02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:56.720
[Amit Varma]: a podcaster uh you know you start realizing that you need to get the ego out of the way

02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:01.640
[Amit Varma]: get the self out of the way and just sit back and listen then you know it would strike me

02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:06.800
[Amit Varma]: that at some level that's then going to percolate through to the rest of your behavior with

02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:12.000
[Amit Varma]: people where inevitably you will also be in some situations treating some people as a

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:17.120
[Amit Varma]: means to an end so could becoming a better podcaster make you a better human being oh

02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:22.560
[Guest]: 100 i'm a better human being as a podcaster now than i was before i was a terrible listener

02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:27.920
[Guest]: i was openly called out for being a terrible listener because i have a tendency which my

02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:33.240
[Guest]: daughter has gotten from me i believe which is that i can zone out very easily so i could

02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:36.920
[Guest]: be talking to you right now and my eyes will glaze a little bit and be looking into the

02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:41.720
[Guest]: horizon and i'm imagining something which is more interesting to me than what is going

02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:46.960
[Guest]: on right now um people have let it go people have called it out through my life but being

02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:51.520
[Guest]: a podcast host you don't have a choice you have to listen have i been guilty of sometimes

02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:56.320
[Guest]: owning out of course you will sometimes have those instances in every every so often in

02:40:56.320 --> 02:41:01.160
[Guest]: an episode where you're like yeah it's okay it's an autopilot i can glaze off for a few

02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:06.560
[Guest]: minutes it's happened but it's made me a better human being because i feel like so when you

02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:11.000
[Guest]: really try to drive a conversation to really try to understand the other person right you're

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:17.840
[Guest]: trying to understand what makes them tick which is why i think i do a podcast is because

02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:23.120
[Guest]: i talk to like advertising is that is a lot of the people are corporate people but i found

02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:29.080
[Guest]: such interesting people with such interesting interests and and thought processes and and

02:41:29.080 --> 02:41:35.960
[Guest]: lives that many times that part excites me so much more than the actual business part

02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:39.720
[Guest]: of it this part of it is great it's great to get into when you understand all of that

02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:46.240
[Guest]: but the nuances of being human is so interesting because i feel people's driving forces people

02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:52.360
[Guest]: even what interests them is has always been um something which i always looked at which

02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:57.800
[Guest]: i which i found interesting and it gives me a way to kind of dig deeper into that yeah

02:41:57.800 --> 02:42:03.080
[Amit Varma]: and actually you know the most rewarding parts of some of my recent conversations are the

02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:06.600
[Amit Varma]: sort of you know where you're not talking about the subject per se but just about the

02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:11.360
[Amit Varma]: person and their journey which like many people were very very moved by uh you know my episode

02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:14.880
[Amit Varma]: with gazala wahab especially the first 90 minutes where we spoke about a personal journey

02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:20.460
[Amit Varma]: or i had the grizzled financial journalist tamil bondopadhyay on my show and he started

02:42:20.460 --> 02:42:24.680
[Amit Varma]: the show by chatting about how during the lockdown it was so heartbreaking for him to

02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:29.840
[Amit Varma]: go out in the streets of bandra and see people who had earlier been vendors now begging and

02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:33.640
[Amit Varma]: one of them you know held his hand and took him to a biryani stall and said please buy

02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:39.440
[Amit Varma]: me something and you know those glimpses of a person's humanity are i think kind of what

02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:44.880
[Amit Varma]: make many of these conversations so rewarding to get back to frameworks for just a moment

02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:49.520
[Amit Varma]: and for the very last time if you are to sort of give advice to creators like if there is

02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:53.360
[Amit Varma]: someone out there who's thinking that hey i want to do a podcast or i want to do a youtube

02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:58.120
[Amit Varma]: show or i want to create whatever you know and can you give me an easy framework which

02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:02.120
[Amit Varma]: will which i don't necessarily have to follow all the way around i can discover my own thing

02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:06.880
[Amit Varma]: but can you give me an easy framework which will help me get started and think about this

02:43:06.880 --> 02:43:11.720
[Amit Varma]: and i think in your newsletter in fact you had actually done this so so what would you

02:43:11.720 --> 02:43:16.520
[Amit Varma]: say how should one begin to then approach that problem where you've got a ton of ideas

02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:20.440
[Amit Varma]: and creativity and all of that but you want to actually you know do something with it

02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:24.680
[Guest]: and bring it together i feel that in today's time to be a creator you need to be able to

02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:32.360
[Guest]: play the long games and how long can you do this and whichever choosing what you do as

02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:37.720
[Guest]: a creator so important it could be that you write it could be that you do a podcast could

02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:45.320
[Guest]: be that you you just make fun videos on on on instagram um could be that you tweet um

02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:51.120
[Guest]: i feel that i i've off late i've rediscovered twitter in many ways because i feel that somewhere

02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:56.680
[Guest]: the algorithm for me has changed and i've gotten this um a set of people who are giving

02:43:56.680 --> 02:44:01.840
[Guest]: me a lot of insights in many things right so you need to find what your medium which

02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:07.320
[Guest]: you can do very easily is uh and i say easily because it should be natural to you right

02:44:07.320 --> 02:44:12.120
[Guest]: there's a learning curve then you have to take your time to do it and i remember when

02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:17.520
[Guest]: i had tanmay uh on my podcast he had said two things um and i found both of them very

02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:22.040
[Guest]: insightful one is he said that there are two kinds of youtubers one are people who are

02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:26.440
[Guest]: supreme experts who will do one to two videos a month right you're really working on it

02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:31.520
[Guest]: pulling it together and stuff and those guys they work on every single nuance the other

02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:34.520
[Guest]: kinds of people are doing stuff every day there's almost every day something coming

02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:38.920
[Guest]: out it's just that you're hitting you with so much volume that you will find something

02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:44.160
[Guest]: that you enjoy and at some point you're almost like waiting to see what you will do tomorrow

02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:49.280
[Guest]: and the other thing he said was he said what would you do for no money who should be what

02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:53.720
[Guest]: you should be as a creator because at some point you are a creator not because you want

02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:58.880
[Guest]: to make money or want to be a star but you're a creator because you really enjoy doing it

02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:05.560
[Guest]: in like i follow this guy called ali abidal um on youtube i have discovered him very recently

02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:10.320
[Guest]: in between i think like late last year i find his journey so fascinating right for a guy

02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:15.240
[Guest]: who was putting up youtube videos on how to prepare for medical exams which i thought

02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:18.680
[Guest]: is interesting because he was doing it anyway so very easily could make it but he was interested

02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:23.440
[Guest]: in this to now being this person who's not he's taking a break from medicine and doing

02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:28.800
[Guest]: all the productivity stuff he's doing because of all the content he's made um such a journey

02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:33.480
[Guest]: but i think at every stage he was doing something that he would naturally be able to do would

02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:39.440
[Guest]: love to do and it just brings out like that flow of authentic content coming out is so

02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:44.400
[Guest]: important because this you can't manufacture this for too long and whenever you try to

02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:48.840
[Guest]: manufacture it because oh somebody is because you will find like for instance you'll find

02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:53.320
[Guest]: many garyvee clones out there right people will watch garyvee content you will find five

02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:57.760
[Guest]: people who are doing exactly what garyvee does i have actually dug into garyvee's framework

02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:01.000
[Guest]: which he shares openly about how to create content i think they're fabulous frameworks

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:05.080
[Guest]: like there's so much to learn from how he says how one piece of content can give you

02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:09.240
[Guest]: ten thousand pieces or whatever six thousand piece of content and i think that's that's

02:46:09.240 --> 02:46:14.360
[Guest]: a great insight do i agree with moses after he says no i find him entertaining in some

02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:20.080
[Guest]: find him insightful in some find him repetitive in most but doesn't mean i have to become

02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:25.080
[Guest]: him i can learn something from him to make what i would come to me naturally do because

02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:29.560
[Guest]: i will never speak like that and if i ever speak about business or speak about entrepreneurship

02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:35.480
[Guest]: but i look at again certain nuances of it so i feel what's most important is to find

02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:41.640
[Guest]: what you can naturally do all day every day do it quickly so my newsletter for instance

02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:47.200
[Guest]: i write like in one flow get done with it on a thursday night or a friday night sometimes

02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:52.000
[Guest]: on a saturday morning about half an hour or an hour and a half before it has to go to

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:57.400
[Guest]: people's inboxes um i've been guilty of that a few times but it's something that i know

02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:02.080
[Guest]: i can naturally write and if you can't be honest about it and and find that once you

02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:07.160
[Guest]: find that then don't think about okay is it going to make me money um am i going to get

02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:11.840
[Guest]: too many listeners or viewers etc for the first many many episodes you know you might

02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:17.800
[Guest]: do a year two years before you get enough listeners or viewers you might do about a

02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:21.560
[Guest]: hundred two hundred like i didn't even look at what my listener count was till i was like

02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:26.680
[Guest]: what 60 70 episodes and because i didn't it didn't strike me that i should look at it

02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:31.480
[Guest]: i used to always gauge it by who would respond to me on a linkedin and instagram because

02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:36.320
[Guest]: i'd have someone write in and ask me a question or give me a point of view or give me something

02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:43.400
[Guest]: they liked about it i'm like people are listening enough validation for the show i'm doing but

02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:49.840
[Guest]: find that find that level of feedback um find that feedback loop for yourself find that

02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:54.620
[Guest]: thing you would love to do and while you do that also explore other avenues and you might

02:47:54.620 --> 02:48:00.680
[Guest]: find something you enjoy as much like for me now why do i make workout videos which

02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:07.520
[Guest]: is an interesting story right so i grew up a scrawny kid um i don't put on weight easily

02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:12.840
[Guest]: which people tell me is a blessing which for me was always okay i'm this um i can very

02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:18.440
[Guest]: easily become this scrawny uh person so i've always tried to put on weight i do all that

02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:23.120
[Guest]: and at some point decided to be fit because i'm a father because i wanted to carry a layer

02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:27.120
[Guest]: around i want to do all that and just get tired very easily because also i quit smoking

02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:33.480
[Guest]: what 11 years ago now but i don't think that's still in the system so i i for fun was doing

02:48:33.480 --> 02:48:37.600
[Guest]: stuff but i actually make my videos because i enjoy the fact that i'm trying to find the

02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:45.080
[Guest]: right track for it and i make everything into a meme so all my videos are literally be using

02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:52.240
[Guest]: workouts as a visual for what is a workplace meme and so that's what keeps me going i'm

02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:57.160
[Guest]: doing it not a for a what do i find as an interesting visual not necessarily interesting

02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:01.120
[Guest]: exercising i do a lot of other stuff which doesn't look great on camera so i don't even

02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:06.160
[Guest]: show them i think this is fun this is a great funny meme to do with it and finally i get

02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:10.480
[Guest]: to collect enough audio music tracks which i would not normally listen to and use them

02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:17.080
[Guest]: in these videos so you will over time find stuff beyond what you normally do focus on

02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:21.620
[Guest]: that's because you keep exploring other formats but don't ignore the prime one which you started

02:49:21.620 --> 02:49:28.440
[Guest]: with let that go and then find another one so now go on that journey keep discovering

02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:33.960
[Amit Varma]: and keep evolving the the first one you built out this is really great advice and i'll kind

02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:39.320
[Amit Varma]: of double down on four of the things you said like one i am a big fan of ali abdal as well

02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:43.920
[Amit Varma]: in fact in my podcasting course i have this slide where i show ali abdal and there's a

02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:48.920
[Amit Varma]: graph in front of him which is something that he shared during a video he made when he reached

02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:53.440
[Amit Varma]: a million subscribers and that graph shows an exponential curve and he's talking about

02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:58.440
[Amit Varma]: how when he you know he made two videos a week for about half a year so he had around

02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:04.000
[Amit Varma]: 50 videos and when he reached the 50th video he hit 1000 subscribers and i'm just thinking

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:08.560
[Amit Varma]: most young people i know they're not going to get to video 50 to hit a thousand the moment

02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:12.560
[Amit Varma]: they see the numbers aren't high you know they are going to drop out in fact you know

02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:16.720
[Amit Varma]: what is often said about science fiction writers or forecasters is what i think is true of

02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:21.440
[Amit Varma]: a lot of creators that they tend to overestimate the short term and underestimate the long

02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:25.600
[Amit Varma]: term so they'll create something and they'll think oh i'll get you know so many followers

02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:30.440
[Amit Varma]: and so many millions or whatever and that simply isn't true in fact abdal's own sort

02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:35.280
[Amit Varma]: of advice to young creators in a subsequent video was that you know if you want to be

02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:41.280
[Amit Varma]: a youtube person make two videos a week for two years so that's like 200 videos and only

02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:46.760
[Amit Varma]: then see how many subscribers you've got so it is actually in that sense playing the long

02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:51.080
[Amit Varma]: game so the advice number one play the long game advice number two flows from this which

02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:55.800
[Amit Varma]: is that do it if you love it because if you don't love it you won't be able to do it you

02:50:55.800 --> 02:51:00.880
[Amit Varma]: won't be able to do two videos a week for two years unless you really care and you're

02:51:00.880 --> 02:51:05.920
[Amit Varma]: really sort of into it and that love again comes from authenticity where you know you're

02:51:05.920 --> 02:51:10.320
[Amit Varma]: being true to yourself and everything you do and not trying to copy a gary vee or someone

02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:15.200
[Amit Varma]: else and not trying to fill a niche or whatever you would do it anyway and then good things

02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:20.440
[Amit Varma]: happen because you do underestimate the long term as well the third one is iterate endlessly

02:51:20.440 --> 02:51:24.120
[Amit Varma]: like out of the you know the two models that you spoke about you know what tanmay told

02:51:24.120 --> 02:51:28.720
[Amit Varma]: you about i really prefer the second model so much where you're doing something every

02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:33.120
[Amit Varma]: day because i think what that model does is that like you shouldn't let perfection be

02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:37.480
[Amit Varma]: the enemy of production as one of my guests said in a previous episode if you just do

02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:42.440
[Amit Varma]: something like what makes for excellence what makes for excellence is iteration you do something

02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:46.640
[Amit Varma]: again and again and again you get better and better at it you know virat kohli does not

02:51:46.640 --> 02:51:51.120
[Amit Varma]: become a great batsman by planning how to bat he plays thousands and tens of thousands

02:51:51.120 --> 02:51:56.080
[Amit Varma]: of balls in the nets so you gotta do that with whatever format it is you are uh kind

02:51:56.080 --> 02:52:00.640
[Amit Varma]: of creating in and finally the fourth one which you know perhaps even i should implement

02:52:00.640 --> 02:52:05.360
[Amit Varma]: in some way is be open you know you might find a groove in doing a particular kind of

02:52:05.360 --> 02:52:10.720
[Amit Varma]: content and you might think that huh i've got this sorted i've learned this but the

02:52:10.720 --> 02:52:15.520
[Amit Varma]: point is that your content is coming from a particular place and there are other kinds

02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:20.480
[Amit Varma]: of content which can come from a particular place so you know just because something is

02:52:20.480 --> 02:52:26.360
[Amit Varma]: working doesn't mean you should kind of get stuck there you know think about different

02:52:26.360 --> 02:52:31.040
[Amit Varma]: ways of sort of doing that and you know these are things i've you know thought a lot about

02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:36.200
[Amit Varma]: and i just feel it's important to kind of let you know drive it home to creators especially

02:52:36.200 --> 02:52:41.720
[Amit Varma]: the bit about the long game which i feel is um uh so true in another of your newsletter

02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:47.240
[Amit Varma]: editions on december 19th you in fact wrote about uh what you call the intimate content

02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:53.080
[Amit Varma]: ecosystem and you spoke about how there are like different layers to this so tell me what

02:52:53.080 --> 02:52:58.280
[Amit Varma]: you mean by intimate content and what these sort of layers kind of are because i find

02:52:58.280 --> 02:53:04.120
[Amit Varma]: that it's a very clear way of sort of uh giving direction to what a young creator might you

02:53:04.120 --> 02:53:10.320
[Guest]: know then be able to envisage himself doing so the whole evolution of how creators even

02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:14.160
[Guest]: function right is that i feel that many times you look at from the outside you look at it

02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:18.920
[Guest]: and i think for me it was because i came from advertising and still am um the idea was okay

02:53:18.920 --> 02:53:24.440
[Guest]: you make money off ads but i feel the real thing is that and again this is a learning

02:53:24.440 --> 02:53:29.200
[Guest]: from from garyvee because i think he gives everything away for free but then as i saw

02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:32.520
[Guest]: more and more youtubers and more and more creators i realized that some things they

02:53:32.520 --> 02:53:35.920
[Guest]: would make people pay for and i said okay what do they make people pay for and i realized

02:53:35.920 --> 02:53:39.960
[Guest]: that they were all building communities and they were building different kinds of communities

02:53:39.960 --> 02:53:46.280
[Guest]: there is this i was listening to uh pivot which is my favorite podcast um and and and

02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:50.920
[Guest]: uh i remember that uh i think between scott and and cara so sure they were saying something

02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:57.320
[Guest]: and said that every person right now be it a journalist be it a content creator is building

02:53:57.320 --> 02:54:02.280
[Guest]: multiple channels of distribution and the more channels of distribution they have the

02:54:02.280 --> 02:54:07.840
[Guest]: more stuff they kind of own right because and that adds back to what the earlier point

02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:11.680
[Guest]: about trying out newer things is right like imagine every creator who was only putting

02:54:11.680 --> 02:54:17.720
[Guest]: stuff on tiktok in india suddenly lost all of that um which is why most of them now are

02:54:17.720 --> 02:54:25.080
[Guest]: also on reel is also on merge and everything else and chingari and all the others um so

02:54:25.080 --> 02:54:28.000
[Guest]: going back to this i feel that what ends up happening is there are certain things that

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:32.440
[Guest]: people are willing to pay for um but for them to be willing to pay for it you also have

02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:36.680
[Guest]: to then kind of build that community of people so it's layers right you have your general

02:54:36.680 --> 02:54:40.160
[Guest]: audience who's listening to it happy with that going ahead some people who want to have

02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:44.640
[Guest]: more interactions who we then kind of build that community with um where you might give

02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:50.640
[Guest]: some extra pieces there and then you'll really find uh this whole concept of super fans and

02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:54.120
[Guest]: i look at super fans is an interesting thing right one is when i look at the only fans

02:54:54.120 --> 02:54:58.280
[Guest]: model not necessarily in the patreon model right i think only fans has a bad name globally

02:54:58.280 --> 02:55:04.880
[Guest]: because of it's used now as a almost a supplement for soft porn but what it traditionally is

02:55:04.880 --> 02:55:10.200
[Guest]: is the fact that i'm giving you exclusive content for you to pay me something and what's

02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:16.200
[Guest]: also happening now with every like look at sub stack sub stack for me why i started writing

02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:21.280
[Guest]: a newsletter was for two reasons um i saw this as an opportunity for me to write again

02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:25.460
[Guest]: as something which i've always been wanting to do for the longest time and secondly let

02:55:25.460 --> 02:55:30.560
[Guest]: me put out an audio version of a newsletter uh which i thought was interesting to try

02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:37.600
[Guest]: out so i said okay it's a it's a private podcast i sent you um it felt so interestingly intimate

02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:41.880
[Guest]: because that's the word i use and eventually at some point would someone pay for that i

02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:46.920
[Guest]: don't know what i'm writing right now is something to be paid for but it started off as me experimenting

02:55:46.920 --> 02:55:51.080
[Guest]: with models which had possible paywalls i know twitter is coming up with a model like

02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:56.200
[Guest]: that i know everybody will come to that and eventually you would subscribe to tiers of

02:55:56.200 --> 02:56:01.680
[Guest]: stuff that you would want from someone who really relate to and that's actually the way

02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:06.200
[Guest]: creators will eventually make the most amount of their money you know i know they all i

02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:09.920
[Guest]: know the creators already do make a large amount of the money through that but if you

02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:15.600
[Guest]: build that system where a set of people are coming to you for a very specific kind of

02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:20.200
[Guest]: content and it doesn't have to be a thousand people or ten thousand people it could even

02:56:20.200 --> 02:56:26.640
[Guest]: be a hundred people fifty people but it's intimate because it's made for you it is exclusive

02:56:26.640 --> 02:56:31.240
[Guest]: because this is what you really enjoy and you're going deeper into it versus the general

02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:35.960
[Guest]: stuff that you would get which everybody else can get as well and the ability to do that

02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:41.120
[Guest]: is something which we finally have because of the internet because of the creator ecosystem

02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:43.960
[Guest]: and that's something which you can always use so you don't necessarily have to be general

02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:49.200
[Guest]: entertainment right i remember in television there used to be this thing about the general

02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:55.080
[Guest]: entertainment channel and the niche channel now it's great to be that niche channel because

02:56:55.080 --> 02:57:01.200
[Guest]: people want niches so if you are niche even if you are a person making a movie for netflix

02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:06.520
[Guest]: your fear niche movie maker i feel that you might get a deal faster than if you're a massy

02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:13.480
[Guest]: movie maker because they need to fill those gaps of all those niches versus kind of giving

02:57:13.480 --> 02:57:18.160
[Guest]: them that a big general entertainment thing so if you have a specific niche and you can

02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:24.280
[Guest]: go deep into that get a captive audience you will find a paying audience and people are

02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:30.080
[Guest]: willing to pay for stuff i feel that we sometimes don't give people enough credit that they

02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:34.640
[Guest]: would pay for things i think people will they just need to see enough value in it um which

02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:39.680
[Guest]: is why the the broader part the general part is so important because that's what gives

02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:44.160
[Guest]: them that level of trust that them paying you some money will give them something of

02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:49.480
[Guest]: value so the general stuff is very important then you kind of drill it down yeah and that's

02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:52.960
[Amit Varma]: fascinating and also the other thing is you know in a country like india with you know

02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:57.680
[Amit Varma]: more than a billion people even a niche can be huge and for a creator you don't really

02:57:57.680 --> 02:58:02.440
[Amit Varma]: need to think of scale like you know like i think of the sort of the two things creators

02:58:02.440 --> 02:58:06.560
[Amit Varma]: need to take into account as being uh you know reach and revenue and you need to think

02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:10.200
[Amit Varma]: about what you're doing for each and what you're doing for revenue and uh you know how

02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:16.000
[Amit Varma]: that kind of uh balances out and and what i would also say is that one when you think

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:23.360
[Amit Varma]: of niche a niche doesn't need to be like an existing uh niche recognized by everyone else

02:58:23.360 --> 02:58:28.000
[Amit Varma]: like say sci-fi is a niche or this is a niche or that is a niche it can just be a niche

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:32.160
[Amit Varma]: that you can build around yourself like you know kevin kelly wrote this essay a decade

02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:36.160
[Amit Varma]: ago about a thousand true fans which is a great phrase and which is coming true today

02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:41.080
[Amit Varma]: on substack where his argument was if you find a thousand fans who are willing to pay

02:58:41.080 --> 02:58:45.120
[Amit Varma]: a moderate amount for you that's enough you don't need more scale than that and on substack

02:58:45.120 --> 02:58:48.880
[Amit Varma]: you actually find you know where your standard subscription is a hundred dollars a year you

02:58:48.880 --> 02:58:53.840
[Amit Varma]: get a thousand people you are actually um sort of doing well enough and there are tons

02:58:53.840 --> 02:58:58.400
[Amit Varma]: of creators on substack who are using that the other point that i would kind of put out

02:58:58.400 --> 02:59:02.920
[Amit Varma]: there as i've discovered from my own experience is that you don't necessarily need to make

02:59:02.920 --> 02:59:08.040
[Amit Varma]: something subscription or put it behind a paywall to make people pay for it like even

02:59:08.040 --> 02:59:13.000
[Amit Varma]: the voluntary model can really work where if people appreciate certain kinds of content

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:19.360
[Amit Varma]: uh they'll be uh kind of perfectly happy to um sort of pay voluntarily now i've taken

02:59:19.360 --> 02:59:23.480
[Amit Varma]: tons of your time this is already like three advertising is dead episodes just in quantity

02:59:23.480 --> 02:59:28.680
[Amit Varma]: not quality mind you uh so i'm going to sort of end with a couple of final questions so

02:59:28.680 --> 02:59:34.680
[Amit Varma]: my penultimate question is really about you know what do you wake up in the morning looking

02:59:34.680 --> 02:59:39.760
[Amit Varma]: forward to like one of the benchmarks that i set for myself the simple question is that

02:59:39.760 --> 02:59:43.960
[Amit Varma]: every morning when i wake up i want to look forward to the rest of the day so therefore

02:59:43.960 --> 02:59:47.680
[Amit Varma]: i want to fill up my tomorrow with something that i know i will look forward to when i

02:59:47.680 --> 02:59:52.360
[Amit Varma]: wake up in the morning which doesn't always happen but i'll just then you know maybe order

02:59:52.360 --> 02:59:57.240
[Amit Varma]: a biryani or something and that'll do for them but so what is and you are obviously

02:59:57.240 --> 03:00:03.160
[Amit Varma]: someone who you know has been reflective has thought about all of this has built frameworks

03:00:03.160 --> 03:00:07.640
[Amit Varma]: even redefined your podcast just by thinking about it rather than going with the groove

03:00:07.640 --> 03:00:13.080
[Amit Varma]: that it was going on quite well so what excites you uh when you wake up in the morning what

03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:17.840
[Guest]: are you looking forward to so if you'd asked me this question pre-covid my answer would

03:00:17.840 --> 03:00:23.240
[Guest]: have been a lot simpler um i've i've always been this n2 person to wake up on a monday

03:00:23.240 --> 03:00:28.560
[Guest]: morning really excited about going to work which people tell me is the most irritating

03:00:28.560 --> 03:00:33.280
[Guest]: thing to have around you uh because i'm like yay tomorrow's monday i'm that person right

03:00:33.280 --> 03:00:38.240
[Guest]: i used to be rather um i still but now i'm this person who's waking up every morning

03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:43.920
[Guest]: saying okay how many things can i actually do today i tried writing a journal and i realized

03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:48.240
[Guest]: i have terrible at writing a journal because i stopped at one question saying why do you

03:00:48.240 --> 03:00:52.480
[Guest]: do what you do and i feel like that it changes every day for me so i couldn't define that

03:00:52.480 --> 03:00:58.720
[Guest]: and i and i and i bought um this uh journal by ryan holiday and i and i couldn't go beyond

03:00:58.720 --> 03:01:03.320
[Guest]: that page and i still have it's been stuck there for like three months now but so i wake

03:01:03.320 --> 03:01:08.440
[Guest]: up releasing a set of things i really want to do and and it it no longer is one thing

03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:14.560
[Guest]: and that's what keeps me excited is that in a day if i only did work for glitch or if

03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:21.120
[Guest]: i only did advertising is dead or only a newsletter i would not be a happy person if in a day

03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:27.680
[Guest]: i'm doing five really different things five different audiences um and i say audiences

03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:33.000
[Guest]: because uh and i speak about this uh to many people these days is when my first episode

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:37.800
[Guest]: with ranveer came out for varun doogi show there was a commenter guy who said even though

03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:41.400
[Guest]: it's your first podcast you've done a great job it's really exciting i'm waiting for more

03:01:41.400 --> 03:01:45.680
[Guest]: right and i and i wrote to him as i i actually was smiling because i was like it's great

03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:50.640
[Guest]: it's a very different audience and i have a fresh set of people to kind of get um and

03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:55.800
[Guest]: and so that's what excites me what excites me every morning is okay so much to do i've

03:01:55.800 --> 03:02:01.200
[Guest]: also learned to wind down by evening because that at some point gets exhausting and i have

03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:06.600
[Guest]: had like weekends weeks where i've just crashed and my brain stops to function but so which

03:02:06.600 --> 03:02:12.920
[Guest]: is i have a wind down system every night where post 8 9 p.m i slowly it's i still i am doing

03:02:12.920 --> 03:02:18.080
[Guest]: a ton of stuff which is that my pace is slower and i drink turmeric tea which is my way to

03:02:18.080 --> 03:02:22.880
[Amit Varma]: wind down i messed up your wind down system tonight apologies for that this has been a

03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:27.440
[Amit Varma]: wind down right and okay so i'll break my final question into two because something

03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:33.320
[Amit Varma]: that you said as usual made further sparks go off which is that you know you're doing

03:02:33.320 --> 03:02:37.440
[Amit Varma]: multiple things and what it seems to me is that you were doing a set number of things

03:02:37.440 --> 03:02:41.520
[Amit Varma]: and those expanded so you were doing the glitch and then you were doing glitch plus advertising

03:02:41.520 --> 03:02:44.840
[Amit Varma]: is dead and then you add newsletter and then you add the varun doogi show and then you

03:02:44.840 --> 03:02:49.960
[Amit Varma]: have the working out videos and all of that and it's expanding what do you do for like

03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:55.760
[Amit Varma]: are there any hacks you'd like to share in terms of a knowledge management and be productivity

03:02:55.760 --> 03:03:01.040
[Guest]: my way of knowledge management is that i scribble stuff down and i used to do it on paper now

03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:06.200
[Guest]: i do it on the phone or the ipad because you lose paper and that's my thing so i have a

03:03:06.200 --> 03:03:11.840
[Guest]: bunch of these snippets either like screenshots or just like stuff i've written down which

03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:17.120
[Guest]: i keep and i feel that's invaluable because we all believe that ideas will stick in our

03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:20.720
[Guest]: head but they come to us in the worst possible time right just when you're going to go to

03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:26.360
[Guest]: sleep sometimes when you're half asleep when you're in the shower always note them down

03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:29.760
[Guest]: they'll help you in the future that's how i write my newsletter half the time my newsletter

03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:35.440
[Guest]: stuff is from some random piece which i i wrote a one line somewhere and i go back to

03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:40.880
[Guest]: that so and that's how i write every week so that's really uh you know one way of doing

03:03:40.880 --> 03:03:46.800
[Guest]: it the other way is to constantly i mean i find apps that really help me i found readwise

03:03:46.800 --> 03:03:51.000
[Guest]: like i mentioned earlier which keeps that i found this fabulous app called next big

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:57.640
[Guest]: idea which i think has been one of the revelations of of my reading life because many times it's

03:03:57.640 --> 03:04:03.920
[Guest]: not just about finishing a book i i sometimes don't end up finishing books but sometimes

03:04:03.920 --> 03:04:07.960
[Guest]: also about finding the right books and next big idea was started by malcolm gladwell adam

03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:13.200
[Guest]: grant and daniel pink and a few others they give you a curation of different non-fiction

03:04:13.200 --> 03:04:19.240
[Guest]: books and they have the author talk about five insights from their book and if you like

03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:23.000
[Guest]: the five insights you might and they give an amazon link to go buy it and their subscription

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:26.400
[Guest]: also has modes where they'll even send you a couple of books every month which i haven't

03:04:26.400 --> 03:04:31.280
[Guest]: done but i subscribe to this part of it it lets me a kind of get a bunch of ideas for

03:04:31.280 --> 03:04:35.000
[Guest]: stuff that's happening people are writing about it's also made me buy a bunch of those

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:40.480
[Guest]: books but not every book has to be read fully in many cases every book some books you just

03:04:40.480 --> 03:04:45.720
[Guest]: need want to get the main insight out of it so that's been one big driver for because

03:04:45.720 --> 03:04:53.360
[Guest]: for me i have this need to get as much information about every random thing into my head but

03:04:53.360 --> 03:04:58.240
[Guest]: i also realize you only have certain amount of time and with a mind like mine you will

03:04:58.240 --> 03:05:02.160
[Guest]: zone out of a book very easily so i don't end up finishing a lot of books and i tend

03:05:02.160 --> 03:05:07.560
[Guest]: to try and go back to them over time and just find different people to follow in the same

03:05:07.560 --> 03:05:15.040
[Guest]: way right so i'm a huge geek culture fan and fanboy of all things marvel dc everything

03:05:15.040 --> 03:05:19.720
[Guest]: right so like i spent four hours watching the snyder cut i watched it straight up and

03:05:19.720 --> 03:05:22.840
[Guest]: i watched it the next day again because puja had only seen one hour and she'd gone into

03:05:22.840 --> 03:05:28.640
[Guest]: sleep and but then i after read that and post that i'll then run through all the youtube

03:05:28.640 --> 03:05:33.560
[Guest]: videos of people discussing smaller nuances smaller easter eggs i'll do that so which

03:05:33.560 --> 03:05:39.480
[Guest]: means i've easily spent a good six to eight hours around the snyder cut if not more um

03:05:39.480 --> 03:05:44.320
[Guest]: in the span of like say a week but that for me is great information like it's some i'll

03:05:44.320 --> 03:05:48.560
[Guest]: store that somewhere it will help in some conversation somewhere and weirdly enough

03:05:48.560 --> 03:05:53.800
[Guest]: those are things i never had to scribble it's the most serious stuff which is frameworks

03:05:53.800 --> 03:05:59.000
[Guest]: or like information or book stuff you ask me something about a random thing that happened

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:02.960
[Guest]: in a zack snyder movie i will remember it verbatim like you ask me what happens in in

03:06:02.960 --> 03:06:09.600
[Guest]: a scene in tridev i will tell you what happens um so i guess something's never changed yeah

03:06:09.600 --> 03:06:13.680
[Amit Varma]: and in you know one of your newsletters feb 6 you spoke about what you call quote the

03:06:13.680 --> 03:06:18.560
[Amit Varma]: balanced information diet stop quote where you spoke about how you need to satisfy your

03:06:18.560 --> 03:06:23.040
[Amit Varma]: heart your mind and your belly so obviously some of the going down rabbit holes as it

03:06:23.040 --> 03:06:27.760
[Amit Varma]: were are you know satisfying different aspects of that and another penultimate question before

03:06:27.760 --> 03:06:31.760
[Amit Varma]: i get to the final question because this came out of that you mentioned somewhere else that

03:06:31.760 --> 03:06:36.080
[Amit Varma]: uh you know that that uh because of being a father you're consuming a lot of content

03:06:36.080 --> 03:06:40.540
[Amit Varma]: you want otherwise for example you've seen frozen many many times and you absolutely

03:06:40.540 --> 03:06:46.040
[Amit Varma]: love it you read her books and all of that so does that help that does having this sort

03:06:46.040 --> 03:06:52.200
[Amit Varma]: of new window into content build a new appreciation and therefore make you a sort of a different

03:06:52.200 --> 03:06:56.480
[Amit Varma]: person as well because you're consuming stuff differently and looking at content differently

03:06:56.480 --> 03:07:02.000
[Guest]: yeah for sure i want to do a dad podcast at some point i will definitely do it i feel

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:09.160
[Guest]: i feel dads don't have information uh out there but the stuff i consume with leah um

03:07:09.160 --> 03:07:12.640
[Guest]: and i find some of it beautiful that i've discovered some really interesting things

03:07:12.640 --> 03:07:19.320
[Guest]: um because i feel a lot of the books that are available for kids now talk about empathy

03:07:19.320 --> 03:07:24.600
[Guest]: they talk about like she has a book which the the main focus is we're all the same but

03:07:24.600 --> 03:07:30.000
[Guest]: we're different right and i find the fact that these are books available now which i

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:35.160
[Guest]: don't think we had when we were growing up right which is which is amazing so even if

03:07:35.160 --> 03:07:40.160
[Guest]: we will talk to her about the color of someone's skin or to talk to her about some people have

03:07:40.160 --> 03:07:44.960
[Guest]: privilege and some people don't at the age where she is she's three and a half um she's

03:07:44.960 --> 03:07:49.720
[Guest]: able to understand some of those concepts because of the stuff she consumes like even

03:07:49.720 --> 03:07:55.280
[Guest]: when i look at frozen and we've seen it like some 50 000 times or if not more in this house

03:07:55.280 --> 03:07:59.960
[Guest]: it's a simple thing right you're not having when you talk about love you're not talking

03:07:59.960 --> 03:08:04.080
[Guest]: about love just between a man and a woman you're talking about the love between two

03:08:04.080 --> 03:08:09.520
[Guest]: sisters and so just some concepts which you can get out of that and i think she understands

03:08:09.520 --> 03:08:15.680
[Guest]: and she's like she's understood what death is because of frozen which i feel is a as

03:08:15.680 --> 03:08:21.840
[Guest]: a darker subject but because she asked us that will at some point everyone go to the

03:08:21.840 --> 03:08:28.240
[Guest]: dark sea which is what you know elsa and anna say her parents have kind of gone to and so

03:08:28.240 --> 03:08:32.400
[Guest]: some concepts are understood and it makes me understand also understand human beings

03:08:32.400 --> 03:08:37.160
[Guest]: right and how certain pieces kind of come to them how you can teach and this side of

03:08:37.160 --> 03:08:44.240
[Guest]: content for me has really opened up just like the possibilities of how someone as young

03:08:44.240 --> 03:08:48.440
[Guest]: could be taught concepts which you might feel are very evolved and you also find some really

03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:52.480
[Guest]: random stuff like there's a book jimmy fallon wrote where he was trying to get his daughter's

03:08:52.480 --> 03:08:58.440
[Guest]: first words i think daughter was son's first words to be papa and he wrote a fun book where

03:08:58.440 --> 03:09:05.640
[Guest]: it's basically all the animals saying moo and papa so basically papa was all over it

03:09:05.640 --> 03:09:11.920
[Guest]: daughter's first words were mama but and you also find stuff like that just like a random

03:09:11.920 --> 03:09:16.320
[Guest]: book it has nothing in it but it's so enjoyable and i get to play with lego again after a

03:09:16.320 --> 03:09:22.140
[Guest]: long time so i'm back to that so yeah it's amazing you suddenly discover different sides

03:09:22.140 --> 03:09:27.480
[Amit Varma]: of interest which engineer can resist playing with lego and that's a lovely quote by your

03:09:27.480 --> 03:09:31.440
[Amit Varma]: dads don't have information that could be the title of your podcast if you ever do one

03:09:31.440 --> 03:09:35.800
[Amit Varma]: okay so now my final final question which is that you know listeners of the scene and

03:09:35.800 --> 03:09:39.960
[Amit Varma]: the unseen are always asking for recommendations what should i read what should i watch you

03:09:39.960 --> 03:09:45.000
[Amit Varma]: know and you of course are in a sense an omnivore of great content but if you had to pick a

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:48.960
[Amit Varma]: handful of things i won't put a number on it but a handful of things which you feel

03:09:48.960 --> 03:09:53.040
[Amit Varma]: were life-changing for you or you recommend to everyone whether they watch it or they

03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:58.640
[Guest]: read it or whatever um you know what would they be so i've been interested in stoicism

03:09:58.640 --> 03:10:03.240
[Guest]: a lot in the last year or so year or two and ryan holiday opened it up for me because he

03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:07.480
[Guest]: normalized that whole thing for anyone who's struggling with the way the world is there's

03:10:07.480 --> 03:10:12.520
[Guest]: a book called stillness is the key it's a fabulous book it digs into age-old philosophy

03:10:12.520 --> 03:10:17.520
[Guest]: but it's just something which i think for the way the world is right now um with everything

03:10:17.520 --> 03:10:21.320
[Guest]: that's going on around you that book has like it's helped me like i go back to that many

03:10:21.320 --> 03:10:26.200
[Guest]: times stillness is the keys is fabulous to kind of go to in the other ones that i've

03:10:26.200 --> 03:10:31.920
[Guest]: read in recent times i'm just kind of thing so if no one's read the ride of a lifetime

03:10:31.920 --> 03:10:36.880
[Guest]: by bob eiger right again a fabulous book just like because i feel arguably one of the best

03:10:36.880 --> 03:10:42.280
[Guest]: ceos of this time and just the fact that um and i was listening to him on masters of scale

03:10:42.280 --> 03:10:49.080
[Guest]: with reid hoffman and it's a two-part uh conversation he talks about how you can actually make so

03:10:49.080 --> 03:10:55.360
[Guest]: many acquisitions as a conglomerate like disney but imagine they acquired marvel acquired

03:10:55.360 --> 03:11:02.800
[Guest]: uh lucasfilm and acquired pixar but let them still have that identity and that exist as

03:11:02.800 --> 03:11:07.040
[Guest]: those brands it's so separate from disney so it's so much to learn from his journey

03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:10.440
[Guest]: and the stuff he's kind of been through so right of left i'm on a more business side

03:11:10.440 --> 03:11:14.720
[Guest]: of things if i had to recommend a podcast in the last couple of years i've listened

03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:19.320
[Guest]: to i'd say two of them one is inside voice which i mentioned earlier there's something

03:11:19.320 --> 03:11:23.680
[Guest]: called inside voice which is not what this is i sometimes said this some once and someone

03:11:23.680 --> 03:11:28.200
[Guest]: posted the other one so i realized there was another one inside voices it's a head gum

03:11:28.200 --> 03:11:33.600
[Guest]: podcast so in case the thing comes in fabulous way to kind of dig into the mindsets of podcast

03:11:33.600 --> 03:11:41.560
[Guest]: hosts and my favorite fictionish podcast in recent times is something called blockbuster

03:11:41.560 --> 03:11:45.720
[Guest]: season one's a story of how george lucas and steven spielberg came up with the blockbuster

03:11:45.720 --> 03:11:51.200
[Guest]: genre of cinema season two is james cameron i'm not a james cameron fan but i love that

03:11:51.200 --> 03:11:55.480
[Guest]: season because it just made me like him a little bit more than because i didn't i don't

03:11:55.480 --> 03:12:00.720
[Guest]: necessarily i didn't like avatar that maybe i'm biased in that front of things so that

03:12:00.720 --> 03:12:07.000
[Guest]: would be my podcast in terms of shows i don't watch as much content as i should on streaming

03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:11.640
[Guest]: but if you haven't watched wonder vision watch wonder vision i feel it's the riskiest thing

03:12:11.640 --> 03:12:17.920
[Guest]: anyone can do to make a show like that considering it was marvel making it because every episode

03:12:17.920 --> 03:12:22.840
[Guest]: is almost like a different genre and they've imagine take a marvel property and making

03:12:22.840 --> 03:12:29.040
[Guest]: it into a sitcom which sounds really bizarre so that so even people who don't necessarily

03:12:29.040 --> 03:12:34.760
[Guest]: subscribe to superhero stuff have enjoyed it because it just feels so different but

03:12:34.760 --> 03:12:42.120
[Guest]: in a non-geek side of things there's this docu-series with dr. dre and jimmy ivine called

03:12:42.120 --> 03:12:47.300
[Guest]: the defiant ones arguably one of my favorite docu-series to go back to i go back to it

03:12:47.300 --> 03:12:52.920
[Guest]: many times i think the story is just generally so interesting i'm not even getting into do

03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:59.400
[Guest]: i am i pro dr. dre not but i think the story of just how that piece worked is is just fabulous

03:12:59.400 --> 03:13:04.880
[Guest]: to look at and and i've always kind of uh it's one of those places i kind of go back

03:13:04.880 --> 03:13:10.720
[Guest]: to um and i kind of re-watch it sometimes and can get some nuances from it so that and

03:13:10.720 --> 03:13:17.640
[Guest]: there's the last one is um there's these guys called the minimalists they do a podcast they've

03:13:17.640 --> 03:13:23.220
[Guest]: done a documentary called minimalism they have a youtube channel as well they have a

03:13:23.220 --> 03:13:29.100
[Guest]: new uh documentary which is on netflix uh which i think is called less is more or something

03:13:29.100 --> 03:13:35.060
[Guest]: like that um as a person who is not a minimalist and everybody laughs when i say i'm watching

03:13:35.060 --> 03:13:40.480
[Guest]: something around minimalism because i'm the opposite of it i'm a hoarder in many ways

03:13:40.480 --> 03:13:44.500
[Guest]: i find that the way they talk about it to be so interesting that it makes me want to

03:13:44.500 --> 03:13:49.580
[Guest]: watch it and i feel that that says something for the fact that someone who is never going

03:13:49.580 --> 03:13:54.180
[Guest]: to be a minimalist i know that i'm not going to but i'm so fascinated by it because of

03:13:54.180 --> 03:13:59.140
[Guest]: how they speak about it so it's a i i think that's an interesting one to watch well you

03:13:59.140 --> 03:14:04.020
[Amit Varma]: know even if lives aren't minimalistic frameworks can be in fact the best frameworks are uh

03:14:04.020 --> 03:14:09.460
