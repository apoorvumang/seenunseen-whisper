00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800
[Amit Varma]: I had a strange dream the other night.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.000
[Amit Varma]: I dreamed that I was lying in a hospital bed, with doctors and nurses all around me, tubes

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
[Amit Varma]: going into me, tubes coming out of me, and the beep beep beep sound of some kind of heartbeat

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.960
[Amit Varma]: machine, which indicated reassuringly that I was still alive.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.800
[Amit Varma]: All my living relatives were gathered at my bedside.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.200
[Amit Varma]: All my dead relatives were standing at the window, waiting for my soul to leave my body

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.360
[Amit Varma]: so I could join them in waiting for the souls of other living relatives to leave their bodies.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.120
[Amit Varma]: I had no idea what had happened to me, but it seemed to be serious.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.840
[Amit Varma]: Just then, a huge doctor in a long white coat walked up to me.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.840
[Amit Varma]: How are you feeling? he asked.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.640
[Amit Varma]: I'm feeling okay, I said.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.640
[Amit Varma]: I feel like talking.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.640
[Amit Varma]: I don't know why.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.720
[Amit Varma]: Kind of strange, isn't it?

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.160
[Amit Varma]: Not strange at all, he said.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it's what I would expect.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.860
[Amit Varma]: After all, we have diagnosed you with a fatal disease.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.680
[Amit Varma]: You have the disease of excessive verbosity.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.200
[Amit Varma]: You talk too much.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.400
[Amit Varma]: One day it will be the death of you.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.760
[Amit Varma]: We must cure this.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.320
[Amit Varma]: Oh my God, I said alarmed.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.320
[Amit Varma]: This is shocking news.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.840
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to die from talking too much.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.840
[Amit Varma]: Please help me.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.840
[Amit Varma]: Please cure me.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.920
[Amit Varma]: The doctor looked at me and said, That's the idea, to cure you.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.600
[Amit Varma]: There is only one medicine for your deadly disease.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.400
[Amit Varma]: Your verbosity can only be cured by peace of mind.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.320
[Amit Varma]: Yes, peace of mind is the medicine.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.280
[Amit Varma]: Then give it to me, I said.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.560
[Amit Varma]: What are you waiting for?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.280
[Amit Varma]: I would like a dose of peace of mind immediately.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.960
[Amit Varma]: It's not so simple, the doctor said.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.600
[Amit Varma]: You see, peace of mind is very expensive and you can't afford it.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.120
[Amit Varma]: That is why you will have no peace of mind.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.560
[Amit Varma]: You will one day die of verbosity.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.560
[Amit Varma]: There is nothing to be done.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.800
[Amit Varma]: Go record a podcast or something.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.240
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.320
[Unknown]: Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.440
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.880
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.880
[Amit Varma]: In today's episode, we're going to talk about drug prices, specifically the tendency of

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.160
[Amit Varma]: the government to fix drug prices so that poor people can afford them.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.920
[Amit Varma]: This tends to have some unsavory unseen effects.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Are there ways around these unseen effects?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.120
[Amit Varma]: To discuss this subject, I have with me as my guest on the show today, my good friend

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120
[Amit Varma]: Pawan Srinath.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.320
[Amit Varma]: Pawan is a fellow at the Takshashila Institution in Bengaluru and he's also a contributing

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.400
[Amit Varma]: writer at Pragati, the online magazine that I edit at thinkpragati.com.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.920
[Amit Varma]: Pawan, welcome to the show.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.920
[Amit Varma]: Hi Amit.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.400
[Amit Varma]: Pawan, what we're talking about today, the scene and the unseen effects, is the government

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.800
[Amit Varma]: mandating, setting prices for certain key drugs, which the common people can't afford.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.800
[Amit Varma]: So for example, India is a very poor country and people can't often afford expensive cancer

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.220
[Unknown]: treatment and so on.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.160
[Amit Varma]: And what the government in its wisdom does to look after these people is it sets a price

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.920
[Amit Varma]: for these drugs at certain points.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.000
[Amit Varma]: And the scene effect of that is that those of them who do buy, get the drug, get it at

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.520
[Amit Varma]: that particular price point.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.480
[Amit Varma]: What are the unseen effects of that?

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.600
[Guest]: The biggest unseen effect is who is, I mean, we have to ask ourselves the question, who's

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.760
[Guest]: creating these drugs, who's doing innovation on this, and will they have the right incentives

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.460
[Guest]: to come out with better drugs in the future?

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.680
[Guest]: And I think if the government decides to set a price, then your reward for doing a better

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.560
[Guest]: drug is nothing, right, because now it's fixed at 20 rupees a pop and you come up with a

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.240
[Guest]: brand new drug, which is 10 times better.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.080
[Amit Varma]: You still have to pay the same amount.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.440
[Amit Varma]: So for example, for a new drug to come up, I've heard a figure of, say, a billion dollars,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.400
[Amit Varma]: which goes into the research of each new drug.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.880
[Amit Varma]: And what you're saying is that, and this is especially true for diseases, which might

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.720
[Amit Varma]: be specific or very important for India, and therefore need research directed here, that

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.840
[Amit Varma]: people simply won't spend the money because they'll say, look, if we can't get our money

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.640
[Amit Varma]: back, then it's a minus EV proposition.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.640
[Guest]: It doesn't make sense.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.640
[Guest]: Right.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.000
[Guest]: So here there are many arguments that are thrown around.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.560
[Guest]: The first is people say, look, whatever private investment has gone into this drug, it's come

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.120
[Guest]: on top of public investment.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.940
[Guest]: This is especially true in the US, in the UK and elsewhere.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.320
[Guest]: So the argument is, since there is a lot of public funding that has gone into this too,

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.400
[Guest]: maybe some of the intellectual property needs to be owned by the public and whoever the

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.520
[Guest]: public is.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.840
[Guest]: And the problem here is that the way scientific research works, the way drug development works,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.640
[Guest]: is that it always rests on a large body of open source scientific knowledge.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.760
[Guest]: That is, I mean, this is the kind of, I mean, you might have a researcher who is studying

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.680
[Guest]: a fruit fly and how deleting one gene in that fruit fly might change its biology.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.320
[Guest]: You will have all kinds of very, very esoteric niche types of research that take place.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.840
[Guest]: And serendipity is a real thing in research.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.160
[Guest]: So eventually enough connections are made such that the knowledge is enough for someone

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.560
[Guest]: to start doing serious drug development.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.560
[Guest]: So this is always a publicly funded layer by and large, sometimes also through philanthropy.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.920
[Guest]: On top of this, now if someone has a promising candidate against HIV, if it's a researcher

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.960
[Guest]: in a university, they might decide to patent it themselves.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.920
[Guest]: Sometimes they might think, hey, this is interesting, but it's not good enough to patent, so they'll

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.440
[Guest]: just publish it.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.960
[Guest]: And so then a private player might go and work more on that and see if that one variant

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.000
[Guest]: of this compound might be patentable.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.360
[Guest]: And eventually things need to work after all this trialing is done.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.440
[Guest]: Once they come up with some compound, it has to go through multiple phases of clinical

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.440
[Guest]: trials.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.240
[Guest]: So the $1 billion is a lot of time and a lot of money by multiple sources.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.840
[Guest]: So they have to recover this.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.640
[Guest]: And the norm has been that the public investment will come and let the private investment reap

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.760
[Guest]: a reward on top of that.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.400
[Guest]: So what happens in India where, you know, none of this happens.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.080
[Guest]: If you look at India's research and development spending on drugs, probably if you take what

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.080
[Guest]: the Gates Foundation spends on dengue and malaria, you take a few other foundations,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.480
[Guest]: the Wellcome Trust in the UK, they're probably spending the same amount or more.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.240
[Guest]: So there is no public investment layer.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.600
[Guest]: And then India is a poorer country.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.220
[Guest]: Tropical diseases are a smaller drug market, and diabetes is a huge global market.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.800
[Guest]: So the moment you have a small market, which is not very well off, the incentives for the

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.620
[Guest]: private sector to come in and develop drugs is also weaker.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.720
[Guest]: So in this environment, if you then go and do price setting, you're killing everything

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.240
[Guest]: and everything becomes dead on arrival.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.240
[Amit Varma]: But here's the paradox.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.160
[Amit Varma]: At one level, the unseen effect of price setting as any price controls would be that there

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.080
[Amit Varma]: is a shortage because obviously the producer, which is a drug companies, don't have the

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.160
[Amit Varma]: incentives to do the research and development necessary to get the drug to market.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.080
[Amit Varma]: But the paradox is that the reason for which those price settings were set in the first

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:45.320
[Amit Varma]: place, that we're a poor country and they can't afford the drugs, also means that because

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.040
[Amit Varma]: we are such a poor country, and there's, you know, not that much of a market for these

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.760
[Amit Varma]: kind of drugs here, that those incentives don't exist in any case for those drug companies

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.880
[Amit Varma]: to actually, do you think that's the case?

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.200
[Amit Varma]: Or do you think that the whole system would function better if those price controls weren't

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.440
[Amit Varma]: there to begin with?

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:08.880
[Guest]: Okay, so I won't use any principles here, but let's just see what's better for the Indian

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.400
[Guest]: public and what's not.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:18.040
[Guest]: So supposing someone invents a new drug to combat blood pressure or diabetes, that's

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:24.800
[Guest]: a problem that affects people globally, and Indians suffer from it too.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.680
[Guest]: So a company can probably make its margins in the US, in the UK, in rich countries, and

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.480
[Guest]: then the company themselves, I mean, they have an interest in offering the drug at a

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.640
[Guest]: lower cost in India, you know, because it's a big thing and the market's large.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:45.320
[Guest]: The alternative is the Indian government can also look sideways on the patent, sort of

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:51.920
[Guest]: people abusing the patent rights, and say that, look, anyway, this drug is available,

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.640
[Guest]: anyway, they'll make their money outside, let's just make it cheap for Indians.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.640
[Guest]: That's fair.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.360
[Guest]: I mean, that will benefit the public.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:04.600
[Guest]: The problem is diseases and disorders that are endemic to India that are explicitly problematic

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.600
[Guest]: for India.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.320
[Guest]: Dengue is my biggest example.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.680
[Guest]: HIV is also a global problem.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.920
[Guest]: So what happens is nobody is going to solve these problems at all.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.440
[Guest]: So either it has to come from public investment, but even their private sector has a role.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.380
[Guest]: So we are then not able to solve that problem at all.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.160
[Amit Varma]: So what do you suggest?

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.240
[Guest]: What's a way forward?

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.880
[Guest]: So there are three things actually we'll have to think about.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.720
[Guest]: One, no matter what, public investment in research and development has to go up.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.960
[Guest]: That's the base case.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:44.280
[Guest]: Second, I think, because India is becoming a richer country, we are not nearly as poor

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.500
[Guest]: as we were 20-30 years ago.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.200
[Guest]: So we can afford to pay more.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:53.000
[Guest]: So where we are thinking about price setting, maybe the government can work out a deal and

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.920
[Guest]: try to subsidize the cost.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:00.760
[Guest]: Let the government bear the remaining cost rather than just completely destroy the incentives

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.280
[Guest]: for the producer.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:08.460
[Guest]: The third thing that India can do is not let patent holders run away with all their rights.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.560
[Guest]: So let's take a few steps back here.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.960
[Guest]: A patent is basically something where if you've come up with an invention, a patent gives

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:21.420
[Guest]: you monopoly over extracting value from that innovation for a certain period.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.600
[Guest]: So you've invested a billion dollars, you've come up with this new drug, you need time

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.740
[Guest]: to recover your investment from this drug.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.600
[Guest]: So you get 10 years, 20 years where you have a monopoly over manufacture of this drug.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.560
[Guest]: After that, it becomes public domain.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.440
[Guest]: So any generic company should be able to pick up that formula and then run with it.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.360
[Amit Varma]: So the term generic is essentially something that was once under patent, but no longer

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.360
[Guest]: is.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.360
[Guest]: So anyone can make it.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.360
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.640
[Guest]: So what is happening here is that patent holders want to extract value from their patent more

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.640
[Guest]: and more.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.380
[Guest]: Who doesn't want more profits?

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.060
[Guest]: So they do something called evergreening.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.720
[Guest]: So the idea is that for one patent to be superseded by a second patent, you need to show that

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.660
[Guest]: your second drug patent is significantly superior to the first one.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.760
[Guest]: So what they do is sometimes the original drug formulation that is patented does not

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.720
[Guest]: have a salt along with the drug.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.900
[Guest]: You know, it's one on usually something is a sulfate, hydrochloride, something like that.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:25.340
[Guest]: And what they do is in the second drug, they file a patent again when the first one is

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.260
[Guest]: expiring and then they add a new salt over there, which makes the drug slightly more

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.260
[Guest]: soluble in water.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.700
[Guest]: You know, it's just more available in the body.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.700
[Guest]: So it'll work better.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.940
[Guest]: You know, you take 50 mg of the first drug, you take 25 mg of the second drug, the effect

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.180
[Guest]: might be the same.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.300
[Guest]: So the company will claim that the second drug is a superior product.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.420
[Guest]: So give me another monopoly for another 10-20 years.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.740
[Guest]: This is called evergreening.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:56.020
[Guest]: And the Supreme Court of India has said that evergreening is fraudulent and that it won't

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.520
[Guest]: stand for it in a specific case.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:03.540
[Guest]: So in this sense, sort of the Indian government has been more conservative and more strict

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:08.260
[Guest]: in sort of deciding what patent holders can get away with, far more conservative than

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.040
[Guest]: what the American courts have been.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.040
[Guest]: And I think that's a good thing.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.660
[Guest]: I mean, it's good to give patent holders the rights to exploit value from this, but, you

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.660
[Amit Varma]: know, enough's enough.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.300
[Amit Varma]: Evergreening is basically a hack to just keep it going beyond the extended period.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.340
[Guest]: Yeah, it's an illegal monopoly.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.140
[Amit Varma]: So you've pointed out three different aspects of what the government could do.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.020
[Amit Varma]: So I have a clarification on the first and a question on the second.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:37.980
[Amit Varma]: The first was, you said there should be more public investment in medical research.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:45.620
[Amit Varma]: Could that be specifically for local ailments like dengue, because after all, in other diseases

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.420
[Amit Varma]: like cancer or blood pressure or whatever, we can just free roll on the efforts of public

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.420
[Amit Varma]: spending elsewhere.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.380
[Unknown]: We don't actually need to add to that.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:58.260
[Amit Varma]: So this would be specifically targeted towards diseases relevant only to us, which are not

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
[Guest]: otherwise likely to see funding.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.100
[Guest]: Yeah, diseases and disorders that affect Indians more than others.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:09.020
[Guest]: So this could also include certain strains of cancer that are just more prevalent in,

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.860
[Guest]: you know, genes that are common in the Indian stock.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.860
[Amit Varma]: Moral cancer.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.860
[Unknown]: Right.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.940
[Amit Varma]: And my question on the second one, where you talk about the government subsidizing, that's

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:24.660
[Amit Varma]: instead of setting the price of, say, a cancer drug at rupees 100 per pill, it can set the

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.020
[Amit Varma]: price at rupees 100 per pill, but subsidize the rest.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.580
[Amit Varma]: So if it really costs 400, the government pays the remaining 300.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.740
[Amit Varma]: But when this is not for generics, when this is for a patented drug that only a specific

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:40.060
[Amit Varma]: company is manufacturing, for example, then doesn't it incentivize that company to charge

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.100
[Amit Varma]: whatever the hell it wants, because the government is going to pay anyway.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:52.220
[Guest]: So the government can still do interesting things, you know, even if, say, it's GlaxoSmithKline

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.100
[Guest]: or someone selling a drug.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.060
[Guest]: Maybe the government can just buy it on the open market in a neighboring country.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.660
[Guest]: So there the price has already been set.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:05.380
[Guest]: So it's not like, I mean, any drug's price needs to be discovered in India for the first

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.380
[Guest]: time.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.040
[Guest]: It will already be operating in the market.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.740
[Guest]: If the Indian government genuinely has a conundrum where, you know, they're trying to negotiate

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:16.540
[Guest]: on a drug which does not exist in the market, yes, what you say is genuine.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.460
[Guest]: So now that they roughly know what the price is in different countries.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.300
[Guest]: So I think there is enough basis for a negotiation.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.980
[Guest]: Unfortunately, it just has to be a negotiation.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.380
[Guest]: I can't think of a better way to solve this problem.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:34.340
[Amit Varma]: And if I ask you to put on your economist hat for a moment and speculate about the downstream

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:40.580
[Amit Varma]: unseen effects of such a subsidy, what are the unwanted, unintended consequences that

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.820
[Guest]: it could lead to in turn?

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.860
[Guest]: The first is a moral hazard.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:49.100
[Guest]: Something is subsidized, so it gets consumed more.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.220
[Guest]: So a drug that costs 1000 rupees is now available for 10 rupees.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:58.680
[Guest]: And so you abuse that drug because you don't, it doesn't pinch you.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.180
[Guest]: The second is supposing the government decides, hey, this is, it's not going to subsidize

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.780
[Guest]: this drug for all Indians, but only for a few, you know, they might be poor or they

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.100
[Guest]: might be from a particular region, whatever reason.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.780
[Guest]: People without Aadhaar cards.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.740
[Guest]: People without Aadhaar cards.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.740
[Guest]: Yes.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.980
[Guest]: And supposing it does so, then the moment you introduce two prices in the ecosystem,

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.980
[Guest]: then you will have arbitrage.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.940
[Guest]: You will have people buying.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.460
[Guest]: So you'll have a PDS for drugs, which already exists, right?

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:32.260
[Guest]: The reason it is not exploited too much is because generics are quite cheap to begin

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.260
[Guest]: with.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.180
[Guest]: Indian pharma, generic pharma companies are among the best in the world.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:42.220
[Guest]: We have amazing synthetic chemists figure out how to create any drug you want at the

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.220
[Guest]: lowest cost.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.700
[Guest]: You know, so we have that going, that's our strength, which is why making policy on this

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.360
[Guest]: becomes more complicated in the country.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:57.620
[Amit Varma]: So broadly, you'd say that, look, the unseen effect of setting prices for drugs is the

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:02.180
[Amit Varma]: shortages and the lack of incentives for companies to invest further in R&D.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.340
[Amit Varma]: So your three pronged solution, therefore, would be that a, there should be more public

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.860
[Amit Varma]: investment in India relevant diseases.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:09.860
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.900
[Amit Varma]: Two, if you have to set a price beyond which, you know, the Indian consumer can't buy and

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.980
[Amit Varma]: too many people will suffer, then you subsidize whatever there is on top of that.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.300
[Amit Varma]: But you make sure that the manufacturer gets a fair market price, whatever that is.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.740
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I don't even know, in the absence of the market mechanism, what a fair market

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.740
[Unknown]: price would be.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.140
[Amit Varma]: But you make sure that he's got incentive to keep selling it to you.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:35.700
[Amit Varma]: And the third one is that you don't allow people to exploit patents by doing the kind

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:40.340
[Amit Varma]: of hackery that evergreening essentially represents.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.340
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.300
[Amit Varma]: I mean, all of these are sort of speculative suggestions.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.100
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it's just a very difficult area to make progress, isn't it?

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.100
[Guest]: Yes.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.060
[Guest]: And that's the thing.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:58.580
[Guest]: No drug in dengue is fundamentally different from one drug for dengue, right?

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:04.780
[Guest]: So we can't imagine an India where we have an Indian medical solution for an Indian problem.

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.640
[Guest]: We've still not crossed that bridge in a big way.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.540
[Guest]: I think we need a few powerful examples.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.540
[Guest]: Probably they're on the way.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:17.900
[Guest]: You know, I mean, there are talks of a dengue vaccine among some researchers.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:23.980
[Guest]: Many of these things float around as ideas for about 10-20 years, lots of research happens,

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.180
[Guest]: eventually something hits the market.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:31.420
[Guest]: So I think the time is right for a few drugs to, few medicines to start coming out of India

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.220
[Guest]: for India.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:39.740
[Guest]: And I think once we see a few of them successful, you know, I think the constituency for more

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.660
[Guest]: reward policymaking on this will only grow.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.660
[Amit Varma]: Pawan, thanks a lot.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.980
[Amit Varma]: It's a pleasure talking to you and thanks for coming on the show.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.340
[Amit Varma]: Thanks Amit.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.620
[Amit Varma]: So I got to finish telling you about the dream that I mentioned at the start of the show.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.100
[Amit Varma]: I was lying on my bed.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:00.940
[Amit Varma]: I had been diagnosed with terminal verbosity and my doctor had told me that only peace

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:05.620
[Amit Varma]: of mind could cure me and peace of mind was out of stock.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.100
[Amit Varma]: What to do?

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:13.780
[Amit Varma]: Just as I was beginning to despair, the doctor said, there may be no peace of mind for you,

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.260
[Amit Varma]: but I have a find for you.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:21.220
[Amit Varma]: There is another medicine that could help you recover deeper than the tender caresses

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.620
[Amit Varma]: of a lover.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:29.060
[Amit Varma]: That medicine is called wisdom and understanding and your verbosity notwithstanding.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:36.860
[Amit Varma]: This medicine is within reach, which is why I beseech you to go right now, somehow, anyhow,

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:43.220
[Amit Varma]: to seenunseen.in to listen to the finest podcast that has ever been.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.220
[Amit Varma]: It is called the seen and the unseen.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.940
[Amit Varma]: Go now, rush.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.460
[Amit Varma]: It will make you hush.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:19:02.660
[Unknown]: Seenunseen.in.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.980
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoyed listening to the seen and the unseen, check out another hit show from Indus

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:12.900
[Amit Varma]: Works Media Networks, Cyrus Says, which is hosted by my old colleague from MTV, Cyrus

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.340
[Amit Varma]: Brocha.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.780
[Amit Varma]: You can download it on any podcasting network.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.060
[Unknown]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.060
[Unknown]: This is your captain speaking.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:26.060
[Unknown]: Sorry to say, but there's been a slight delay due to the apocalypse having suddenly begun.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.060
[Unknown]: As you can see, there's death, destruction and chaos taking place all around us.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.180
[Unknown]: But don't you worry, food and drinks will be served shortly.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:40.660
[Unknown]: And I would recommend checking out IVM Podcasts to get some of your favorite Indian podcasts.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.540
[Unknown]: We'll keep you going till this whole thing blows over.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:20:01.060
[Unknown]: Thank you.
